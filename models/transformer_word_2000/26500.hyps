<unk> year I showed these <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> , which for about three million years has had the size of the United States <unk> , has <unk> <unk> <unk> .
So , we 're going to <unk> the <unk> of the problem because it doesn 't show the ice <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> is , in a way , the heart <unk> of global warming .
They <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
The next <unk> is going to be a <unk> <unk> on the last 25 years .
<unk> <unk> are <unk> in red .
You see , it <unk> up to the blue <unk> .
That 's the ice in <unk> , which is <unk> in summer .
You can see that the <unk> ice <unk> , of five years or more , it 's like blood , that here is <unk> from the body .
In 25 years , it 's been the way , in the way .
This is a problem because the <unk> is <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> around the ocean , where there are enormous <unk> of <unk> that , <unk> , are <unk> in <unk> from the <unk> .
<unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , the amount of <unk> could <unk> , that <unk> <unk> , that <unk> <unk> .
In some <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> , the <unk> is already <unk> from the water .
The <unk> <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> ! <unk> : You 're doing it 's right . The question is if you 're <unk> it .
A reason is that this <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> from the north .
This is a river in <unk> <unk> .
<unk> had never <unk> <unk> .
This is the <unk> river in the <unk> of <unk> .
If you want to know how the sea level to <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> on the <unk> , you know , you 're where the sea .
These <unk> are <unk> <unk> .
On the other part of the planet : <unk> , the biggest <unk> of ice on the planet .
<unk> month , the <unk> scientists have <unk> that the ice <unk> is in <unk> , and that <unk> <unk> , which <unk> on some <unk> <unk> , is particularly <unk> in the <unk> .
<unk> at six feet of the <unk> , like <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , the biggest <unk> of ice , you see new <unk> , which few years ago , were <unk> .
<unk> percent of the world population <unk> <unk> <unk> from the <unk> .
<unk> <unk> : This <unk> is the <unk> of <unk> water
<unk> is <unk> .
But when you <unk> , the same happens to the water .
In California , <unk> <unk> <unk> is <unk> percent <unk> .
<unk> <unk> are in crisis .
<unk> , as you read , they 're <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> in the world <unk> <unk> to a <unk> increase in the world .
<unk> <unk> are <unk> to a <unk> outside the normal and without <unk> .
<unk> times more <unk> in the last 30 years than <unk> <unk> .
This is a <unk> of <unk> .
If you look in the context of <unk> you can see if you can see it in the <unk> .
In the last five years we 've <unk> 70 million <unk> of CO2 every 24 hours of <unk> in the oceans .
Look at the area of the <unk> <unk> , from the <unk> , to <unk> , and on both parts of the <unk> <unk> , where there 's a <unk> <unk> of oxygen in the ocean .
<unk> 's <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , which is 20 percent of them , is the use of <unk> <unk> .
<unk> is a problem , and <unk> is even worse .
The United States is one of the two countries with <unk> emissions , together with China .
And it 's <unk> to build a lot of other <unk> <unk> .
But we 're <unk> to a <unk> of a direction .
These are the projects <unk> over the last few years and some of <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> , there is a political <unk> in our country .
<unk> <unk> and oil <unk> have <unk> million dollars in the last year for <unk> <unk> , which is a <unk> .
I 'm going to give you something --
<unk> <unk> , in <unk> , where I live , there was a <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
You may have seen it on the <unk> .
This is the second biggest flow of <unk> in America .
It 's been around <unk> .
<unk> <unk> of one of the <unk> <unk> was this .
<unk> : <unk> ♫ ♫ <unk> the <unk> is a <unk> and happy .
It 's <unk> here in America , and it makes our economy .
<unk> the <unk> is <unk> <unk> .
It 's <unk> , <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> it .
<unk> : From here is a lot of <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The biggest <unk> society on the <unk> is <unk> <unk> . This is his <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> : <unk> <unk> -- Al <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> -- don 't know what they 're talking about .
<unk> <unk> : So the <unk> for the <unk> of <unk> has <unk> two <unk> .
This is one of them , one part .
<unk> : <unk> : <unk> <unk> we see <unk> changes as a <unk> <unk> <unk> to our business .
So , our <unk> is <unk> a great amount of money in a <unk> <unk> to <unk> , public and <unk> the truth on <unk> .
In fact , <unk> is not <unk> .
We think it 's <unk> -- it also has a good <unk> .
So not <unk> of climate change .
We want to do it .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> : <unk> <unk> -- you 've heard about it .
So we 're going to <unk> a <unk> structure as much as <unk> is about <unk> <unk> .
<unk> ! <unk> ! <unk> ! This is a little bit <unk> , but this is the sound of the <unk> technology .
<unk> <unk> is between the major <unk> of global warming , but the <unk> technology technology that you see everything .
Let 's look : this is the <unk> <unk> technology .
<unk> : <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to the economic issue and the national security .
<unk> : <unk> America is in crisis ; the national security , the national security crisis .
The <unk> that <unk> all : our <unk> from the <unk> <unk> <unk> , like <unk> and oil <unk> .
Now , there 's a new , <unk> solution for <unk> .
<unk> America : 100 percent of <unk> energy , in 10 years .
A <unk> for <unk> America at work , more <unk> , and help to <unk> global warming .
<unk> , a solution that we 're going to be <unk> our problems .
<unk> America . <unk> more .
<unk> <unk> : This is the last one .
<unk> : <unk> : It 's about <unk> energy to America .
One of the most <unk> ways of <unk> <unk> at the end of the <unk> that we <unk> our planet .
<unk> : The future is here . <unk> , <unk> , a new network <unk> .
<unk> <unk> 2 : <unk> <unk> for jobs <unk> <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> America . It 's time I 'm <unk> to be <unk> .
<unk> : A old <unk> <unk> <unk> says , " If you want to go to the yourself .
If you want to go far , you go together . "
We have to go far , quickly .
Thank you very much .
<unk> year at TED , I made a <unk> on <unk> .
And I decided to <unk> it to <unk> how the car works .
So , I 'm going to go . And for those who had no , the <unk> is the biggest scientific experiment ever <unk> -- <unk> miles of <unk> .
<unk> is to <unk> the conditions that were in the <unk> of a <unk> <unk> <unk> in the beginning of the universe -- until <unk> million times a second .
All that is simply <unk> .
This is the car under the <unk> .
We 're going to <unk> these <unk> <unk> in the <unk> .
This is what I work . It 's called <unk> -- <unk> <unk> feet , and it has a <unk> <unk> .
This is a <unk> image of <unk> in construction , so you can see the <unk> .
<unk> <unk> last year we <unk> the car car for the first time .
And this picture was taken by <unk> .
It was <unk> <unk> in control room .
It 's a picture of the first <unk> of particles that had made all the <unk> , <unk> in <unk> , with a part of the <unk> , and we <unk> particles in the <unk> .
In other words , when you take that picture the 10 <unk> , you know that the machine is a great <unk> .
I don 't know if it was this to <unk> us more or this , when someone <unk> on Google and say , it 's this .
That means that we 've had an impact <unk> beyond that scientific .
<unk> a week later , there was a problem with the machine , <unk> to these <unk> here -- these <unk> <unk> .
These <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> when the machine works at the <unk> of the <unk> .
Now , the <unk> between you <unk> <unk> and <unk> , " It 's not true . I 'm too <unk> . "
And they can do it because when they 're very <unk> to become the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
So at less <unk> degrees , at a temperature <unk> at the <unk> of the space between stars , these <unk> can bring that <unk> .
In one of the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> in the <unk> , there was a <unk> <unk> .
So the <unk> <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
This was the result .
Now , this is even more <unk> if you think that these <unk> <unk> over 20 <unk> , and that 's <unk> <unk> .
They <unk> about 50 <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , what we did .
We have <unk> and <unk> .
They 're all <unk> to their <unk> .
<unk> the end of <unk> <unk> is going to be again <unk> .
We <unk> it , and we <unk> to get some data to <unk> or <unk> , and so on our <unk> to find out what the <unk> are the universe .
Now , of course , in a way , these <unk> <unk> <unk> the value of science and engineering engineering <unk> .
I think that it 's so hard , the fact that it 's so hard , the fact that I think is this the value of things like <unk> .
I want to end with the words of a <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , who , <unk> , in the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> , his <unk> was Michael <unk> , said , " It 's not so <unk> for the progress of the human mind as much as the <unk> that the ideas of science are <unk> , that our <unk> are <unk> , and that there are no new <unk> that there are no new <unk> that there are no new <unk> that there are <unk> that there are no new <unk> <unk> that there .
Thank you .
I want to start with you to <unk> you to <unk> it to <unk> it to <unk> .
<unk> it as a <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> relationships .
<unk> <unk> is <unk> <unk> to the way that we <unk> most of the world around us .
So , as a <unk> <unk> from the <unk> of our <unk> with objects , <unk> with my <unk> <unk> , and I started <unk> , I started <unk> : " And if we use a computer , instead of having the only <unk> of the <unk> as digital <unk> that moves on a <unk> , you have the information with both hands ,
and we start our <unk> ?
The question was so interesting that I decided to try to explore the answer , building the <unk> .
In a few words , a <unk> is a computer <unk> as a <unk> .
In a few words , a <unk> is a computer <unk> as a <unk> .
You can <unk> them with your hand , they can <unk> them , they can <unk> them , feel the movement and they have a screen and a <unk> radio <unk> .
But <unk> , they 're <unk> objects , like <unk> , you can just <unk> <unk> .
<unk> are the <unk> of a new <unk> of tools to <unk> digital information .
And as they become more <unk> , <unk> of the movement , <unk> of the other , and as they become more <unk> , <unk> of the other , of how we <unk> them , we can explore and <unk> <unk> .
Let 's start with some simple example .
This <unk> is <unk> to show you about the video : if you <unk> it in one direction , the video you 'll see it in a direction , the video you 'll see it so , if you go back to the other side .
These <unk> <unk> are <unk> of others .
If you <unk> them , you 're <unk> to what they 're going to happen .
If they 're <unk> , you can <unk> it and they can <unk> a little bit .
If they 're <unk> , you can <unk> it and they can <unk> a little bit .
They also <unk> their movement and <unk> .
And we realized that one of the interesting <unk> of the <unk> was that that could use <unk> on the data , for example , <unk> , as if it was a <unk> .
In this case , we have three <unk> <unk> as a <unk> <unk> , and I can <unk> it to <unk> the color , where they 're <unk> .
and I can <unk> it for <unk> color in the central , where you 're <unk> .
If you get too much , you can <unk> it a little bit of a place .
There are also <unk> possibilities , like <unk> , like <unk> , mathematics and <unk> where people can try things things things , and you <unk> the results .
I 'm --
This is a <unk> sequence I do with a <unk> program .
Here we have a <unk> of words that are half between <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> , at every <unk> , you know , you have a letter in every <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , at each <unk> <unk> , and as we were talking about <unk> , he <unk> him <unk> on a <unk> .
Then , after about 30 seconds , you <unk> , and you have a new <unk> <unk> and new possibilities to try .
Thank you .
Here 's children <unk> in <unk> <unk> at <unk> <unk> , I made it so I <unk> them and I <unk> a video .
They 're very <unk> .
And one of the interesting things of these <unk> is that you don 't have to give people a lot of <unk> .
I just said , " <unk> of the words , " and they know exactly what to do .
Here 's other people who <unk> it .
This is our <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , there on the right .
He actually wanted to <unk> .
They were just <unk> , for him .
Now , this is a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
He wanted to build a <unk> for the <unk> of the <unk> . He 's <unk> .
It can <unk> new characters in the scene , <unk> their <unk> .
It can <unk> new characters in the scene , <unk> their <unk> .
So , here 's what the sun is doing .
<unk> : The sun is <unk> .
David <unk> : Now he 's brought a <unk> in the scene .
<unk> : The <unk> <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> . Yes !
So , you <unk> the <unk> and <unk> can <unk> the characters --
<unk> : <unk> !
-- I 'll tell you , you know , your story .
<unk> : <unk> !
<unk> : It 's a story with the open , and it can decide how to <unk> it .
<unk> : It 's a story with the open , and it can decide how to <unk> it .
<unk> : <unk> away , <unk> .
<unk> : The last example I have time I 'm going to show you is a <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> and <unk> music .
It 's a recent <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> music .
The <unk> here are <unk> <unk> as a <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> of these have four different <unk> , and you can choose which to use .
You can also <unk> these <unk> in a sequence from <unk> to your <unk> .
And you just <unk> a sound and a sequence and a sequence of it .
These are effects that you can control live , like <unk> and <unk> .
It <unk> it to a particular sound and then <unk> to <unk> .
And then there are the effects of time and <unk> , that <unk> the entire sequence .
<unk> how it works .
<unk> : <unk> : <unk> <unk> a <unk> in two <unk> <unk> , " sequence , " <unk> in one series , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk>
Now you 're going to take a little line .
<unk> : <unk> : Now we 're going to <unk> --
<unk> : <unk> : And now I 'm going to <unk> the <unk> , so I can control the effect of the live .
<unk> : <unk> : I can <unk> the entire sequence time on one side or the other .
<unk> : <unk> : And now we 're going to <unk> the bottom to give more <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> : I can <unk> the sequence of the flight .
So I don 't have to <unk> it before , but I can <unk> it , <unk> more <unk> or more <unk> .
And now , finally , I can <unk> the whole sequence of <unk> on the left the <unk> " <unk> . "
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is to build new <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to how our brain work and body .
And today , I 've had time to show you one of the results of this path , and some possibilities that we 're trying to get out of the lab .
The concept I want to <unk> you is that it 's <unk> this new generation of objects to <unk> the <unk> media , that we want to <unk> information in our world in the way we want .
Thank you very much .
I don 't see the time of talking to all of you .
I 'm a <unk> .
<unk> books is my <unk> , but it 's more than this , of course .
It 's also love and love <unk> .
And I don 't think that it can change .
But , I said , something that is that 's happened in my life and my career , which led me to <unk> the whole relationship with this job .
The particular thing is that I <unk> wrote this book , this <unk> called " <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , " which , <unk> , " which , <unk> , " which , " <unk> , " <unk> , " <unk> <unk> . "
And the result is that everywhere you have now , people <unk> me as if I was <unk> .
<unk> -- <unk> , <unk> !
<unk> to me now , and they 're saying , " You don 't fear that I 'm going to be able to do it better .
You don 't fear you have to write the whole life without able to be able to create a book that 's going to be <unk> to someone ? "
<unk> you can <unk> to someone ? "
It 's <unk> , you know .
But it could go worse , <unk> , part of that I remember over 20 years ago , when I started to say people -- I was a <unk> -- I wanted to be a <unk> .
We 're going to be <unk> <unk> from fear .
And people say , " Don 't you know I don 't want to be able to success ?
You don 't fear that the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> ?
You don 't fear to do this <unk> for the whole life without anything that anything is ever going to ever come out and die on a <unk> of <unk> with the mouth full of <unk> <unk> ?
So , you know .
The answer -- the short answer to all these questions is , " Yes . "
Yes , I 'm afraid of all those things .
I always was afraid .
And I 'm afraid of many other things that people don 't have to be <unk> .
Like <unk> and other things <unk> .
But , as I 'm going to write it what I thought and <unk> is why ?
Is it <unk> ?
It 's <unk> that anybody who <unk> <unk> <unk> from a job that you feel like you 're born to do .
But what is that particular is that particular in the <unk> <unk> <unk> to <unk> health care about <unk> <unk> in a way that other <unk> don 't do ?
How do my father , for example , he was a <unk> <unk> and not one of one time in his <unk> of activity where he was asked if she was afraid to be <unk> <unk> ?
<unk> 't it was ever -- that <unk> of <unk> John , how do you go ?
<unk> 't you like that , <unk> ?
<unk> , engineers <unk> as a group of certainly , <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
We <unk> , we have enough this <unk> , and not only <unk> but <unk> <unk> of all kinds of things , we have this <unk> of being <unk> <unk> .
And they 're not going to be able to look at the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> that , only in the <unk> century , <unk> young and often for them .
And the ones that are not <unk> to be really <unk> by their <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , before you die in the last <unk> said , " Every my book <unk> me , he <unk> me a little bit more , " <unk> about the work of his life .
But we don 't have to <unk> you when you say that because we heard these things so long that somehow we have , and we <unk> the <unk> that creativity and <unk> are <unk> in some way , and that the art , eventually , we always <unk> to the <unk> .
And the question I want to <unk> you to all this is : are you agree with this idea ?
It 's OK , it 's <unk> -- because it 's also <unk> by a <unk> <unk> <unk> to me .
I think it 's <unk> .
And I think it 's also <unk> and I don 't want to <unk> you in the next century .
I think it 's better to <unk> our big <unk> <unk> to live .
And I certainly know that , in my case -- it would be very <unk> to start <unk> to the <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> in which I 'm in my career .
<unk> -- look at it , I 'm quite young , I have about 40 years .
I still have about four <unk> of work in me .
And it 's very <unk> that anything will happen now in the world will be <unk> by the work that 's going to be <unk> by the way , I 'm going to <unk> it from my last book .
<unk> <unk> , because we 're all about <unk> <unk> here -- is <unk> that my biggest success is to my <unk> .
Oh , <unk> , <unk> , thinking !
You know , this is the kind of <unk> thinking that brings a person to the nine <unk> <unk> at the morning and I don 't want to do it .
I 'm going to continue to do this work that I love .
So , the question becomes , how ?
And so it seems to me , after many <unk> , that the way of working on and write is to create a <unk> <unk> <unk> , right ?
I have to get a <unk> distance of security between me , which I 'm <unk> , and the natural <unk> on what we could get . And as we were <unk> for the last year models of how to do we start looking through the time , and find other societies to see if you have better ideas and see if you could have better ideas and more <unk> and more <unk> ideas to see if you have better ideas and more <unk>
about how to help people <unk> <unk> <unk> of creativity .
And that research led me to the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
<unk> because they 're going to go back to the <unk> and then <unk> back .
<unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> -- people don 't believe that creativity <unk> of creativity , you know ?
It <unk> that creativity was this <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> to men from some <unk> <unk> and <unk> , for reasons and <unk> and <unk> , for reasons and <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> of creativity <unk> <unk> of creativity " <unk> . "
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> to have a <unk> that <unk> <unk> from <unk> .
The <unk> were the same idea , but we <unk> that sort of <unk> that kind of spirit without a <unk> .
And it 's <unk> , because <unk> don 't really want to be somebody who was particularly smart .
And I thought that a <unk> was this kind of <unk> <unk> that <unk> literally <unk> in the <unk> of the study of a artist , a little bit like <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> the work of the artist and <unk> the result of that work of the artist and <unk> the result of that work .
<unk> <unk> , that 's the distance I 'm talking -- that <unk> <unk> that <unk> you <unk> that you get from the results of your work .
And they all thought it was how they were you <unk> , right ?
So , the <unk> artists were <unk> by <unk> things , like too <unk> , for example , right ?
If your work was <unk> , you didn 't have to <unk> the <unk> , we all knew that we had been <unk> by this <unk> <unk> .
If your work <unk> , it was not all your <unk> , right ?
Everybody <unk> that was your <unk> to be a <unk> .
And so people <unk> <unk> creativity , for a long time .
Then the <unk> <unk> and everything , and we <unk> this great idea ; we put the human being at the center of the universe and the center and the <unk> and <unk> and without more to <unk> the <unk> that <unk> <unk> .
This was the <unk> <unk> and people began to think that creativity is <unk> completely <unk> from the <unk> .
And for the first time in history , it <unk> to <unk> this or that artist as a <unk> rather than a person with <unk> .
And I have to <unk> , I think it was a big <unk> .
I think you 're going to get to believe that you 're like a <unk> like the source , the <unk> and the <unk> of all the <unk> <unk> , <unk> and <unk> and <unk> is a <unk> responsibility for human <unk> .
It 's like to ask someone to <unk> the sun .
<unk> and <unk> completely <unk> and <unk> all these <unk> <unk> on the <unk> .
And I think it was this pressure that <unk> artists in <unk> 500 years .
And if that 's true , and I think it 's , the question is , the question becomes , and right now ?
Can we do it <unk> ?
<unk> to a more <unk> understanding of the relationship between humans and <unk> <unk> .
Or maybe not .
Maybe we can 't <unk> 500 years of thinking in an 18 minutes of <unk> .
And there 's probably people in the audience who <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> on the <unk> , you do <unk> , you <unk> people who are <unk> <unk> of <unk> on their projects .
You probably don 't <unk> you all about this .
But the question I 'd like to <unk> is -- why don 't you ?
Why don 't we do that ?
Because it makes more sense of anything that has ever heard about to explain the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> process .
A process that , as anyone who has ever <unk> to do something -- so , basically , everybody -- you know , you don 't <unk> <unk> .
And in fact , it can sometimes be completely <unk> .
I 've been <unk> this <unk> <unk> with the extraordinary <unk> <unk> , who has now now 90 years , but that was a <unk> for the whole life and he said that during his <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> , <unk> out in the <unk> <unk> , <unk> out in the <unk> .
He said it was like a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And that <unk> <unk> to her from the <unk> .
You know , you know , because he was <unk> the land under his feet .
I decided to have one thing to do at that point and was , words , " <unk> as a <unk> . "
And so he was <unk> to the house and was <unk> by this <unk> , and it wouldn 't have to do anything else that take a piece of paper and a <unk> enough <unk> , as you <unk> , <unk> and <unk> on the page .
<unk> , sometimes you couldn 't be <unk> enough , so <unk> and <unk> and <unk> without able to get home and <unk> it and she would <unk> it through and she would <unk> it through and she would <unk> it through the <unk> , looking for , as she said , " another <unk> . "
Then there were those times -- this piece , never <unk> it -- there were times when the <unk> was almost <unk> , right ?
So , he was <unk> home and he was looking for the paper and the <unk> her through , and he <unk> a <unk> just in the while he was <unk> , and then he said , that was like , and then he was <unk> .
<unk> the <unk> from the tail and <unk> it into his body and the <unk> on the page .
And in these cases , the <unk> would be <unk> on the <unk> page and <unk> , but <unk> , the <unk> <unk> to the first one .
So when you <unk> it -- it 's <unk> , it 's <unk> , it 's exactly <unk> to my <unk> process .
Not my <unk> process -- I 'm not a <unk> !
I 'm a <unk> , and my way of <unk> is ; I 'm <unk> at the same <unk> every day and work and work and <unk> and work and <unk> it .
But even me in my <unk> , I <unk> against that thing , sometimes .
And I 'm sure that many of you <unk> that .
You know , even if the work and ideas , I <unk> to <unk> from a certain source , I couldn 't <unk> <unk> .
And what is this thing ?
And how can we <unk> it in a way that we don 't have to <unk> your head , but rather , that <unk> <unk> us ?
As I 'm <unk> , I 'm the best <unk> I have is the <unk> <unk> <unk> , which I 've been <unk> <unk> <unk> , which I 've been <unk> for a <unk> .
And I 'm talking about this , and you know , <unk> , for the <unk> of life was the <unk> of the <unk> artist , <unk> , <unk> these <unk> <unk> <unk> completely <unk> .
But then <unk> , he <unk> , and one day while he was <unk> on a <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> it all over him .
It 's going fast and everything of a <unk> <unk> , this little <unk> of <unk> , which comes into his head as the <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , and you know , and the <unk> , but not <unk> , you know , it 's wonderful , and it 's not how to <unk> .
It doesn 't have a piece of paper , it doesn 't have a <unk> .
So he starts to feel this sort of old <unk> <unk> grow in him , like , " I 'm going to lose , and I 'm going to go from this <unk> song .
I 'm not enough , I can 't <unk> enough . "
And instead of going to <unk> , they <unk> .
<unk> the whole process of <unk> and made something completely new .
You just <unk> the sky and said , " <unk> , don 't you see I 'm <unk> ? "
" It seems to you , you can write a song now ?
If you really want to <unk> , you 're in a more <unk> moment when I can take care of you .
<unk> , we 're going to <unk> <unk> another today .
<unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> . "
And his <unk> process after this .
Not the work , the work was still <unk> as always .
But the process , and the <unk> <unk> that <unk> was <unk> when he <unk> the <unk> , the <unk> that it turns out that it was <unk> , which was <unk> out of where , <unk> that had no <unk> , they had not to be a <unk> and <unk> .
But I would <unk> this <unk> , <unk> <unk> a conversation between <unk> and this thing <unk> and <unk> thing that <unk> and <unk> thing , but it wasn 't <unk> .
So , how much that story is <unk> to change a little bit , the way I 'm <unk> and already <unk> me once .
This idea , I was <unk> when I was <unk> , " <unk> , <unk> , " and I 'm going to go into one of the <unk> of the <unk> where we 're all working on something , and you don 't get it to think that it 's going to be a <unk> , that 's going to be the <unk> , that 's going to be the <unk> book .
Not just <unk> , the <unk> book .
And we start thinking about <unk> this project .
But then I 'm going to <unk> me that I was <unk> to the air and <unk> .
So I <unk> my face on the <unk> and I <unk> my <unk> at a <unk> <unk> <unk> of the room .
And I said , " <unk> , what , both we know that if this book is not going to be <unk> , right ?
Because as you see I 'm <unk> all I have , I don 't have more than that .
So if you want it to be better , you have to <unk> and do your side .
OK . But if you don 't do it , you know what , I don 't do it , you know what .
I started to write the same because it 's my work .
And I would <unk> you that it was <unk> that I 'm <unk> to do my part . " Because it 's so , OK -- <unk> does it in the <unk> of the North Africa , people <unk> to <unk> the <unk> <unk> , <unk> music that <unk> on the <unk> , music that we 'll be <unk> for hours to <unk> .
And they were always <unk> , because the <unk> were <unk> and they were <unk> .
But every <unk> , <unk> , something <unk> , and one of these <unk> artists actually <unk> reality .
And I know you know what I 'm talking about , because I know you 've all seen , at some point , you know , you know , at some point , that 's so .
It was like the time , and the <unk> <unk> through a kind of <unk> and it was not doing anything else from usually , like <unk> <unk> <unk> before , but everything was <unk> .
And suddenly it doesn 't just like a human .
But it <unk> out of the <unk> and <unk> in the fire of the <unk> .
And when this <unk> , at the time , people <unk> what was , you know , you know , you know ,
<unk> your hands and <unk> to <unk> , " <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , God , " God , "
That 's God , you know .
<unk> <unk> -- when the <unk> <unk> <unk> , you can see this <unk> with them and the <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> , " <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , " <unk> , <unk> , " <unk> , " <unk> , " which you can hear in the <unk> or in the <unk> .
In <unk> , when an artist has done something impossible and <unk> , " <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , " <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , " <unk> , <unk> -- a <unk> of God .
And it 's <unk> because we need it .
But , the problem comes after day , for the <unk> itself , when you <unk> and <unk> that are 11 <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> <unk> of God , there is no more .
It 's just a <unk> <unk> with great <unk> , and maybe you never <unk> to that <unk> .
And maybe nobody <unk> the name of God still <unk> , as you know , what 's going to do with the rest of his life ?
It 's hard .
This is one of the most <unk> <unk> to do in a <unk> life .
But maybe it doesn 't have to be so <unk> if you can 't believe , you can 't believe , that the most <unk> of your being come from you .
But you just <unk> that you are <unk> from a <unk> source of this <unk> part of your life that you have to go to <unk> another when you 're finished .
And , you know , if we think it all change .
And so I started to <unk> , and it 's certainly like I <unk> it for several months in the <unk> of the book that I was <unk> , <unk> , <unk> of my success .
And what I have to continue <unk> when I feel <unk> from this is , I don 't fear .
Don 't <unk> . You just have your work .
<unk> to <unk> for your side , whatever it can be .
If your work is <unk> , you 'll be <unk> .
If the <unk> , you 're going to <unk> you would <unk> <unk> <unk> some kind of <unk> , for one moment through your <unk> , " <unk> ! "
<unk> , you do the same your <unk> .
And " <unk> ! " <unk> ! " <unk> .
I think that and I think it <unk> .
" <unk> ! " <unk> ! " <unk> ! " <unk> ! " <unk> "
Thank you .
Thank you .
<unk> <unk> : <unk> !
As you know , I talked about some of these projects on the human genome , what it can <unk> and the discovery of new genes .
We 're going to <unk> a new path : we started <unk> biology and now starting from that digital code , we 're <unk> in a new <unk> of biology , <unk> and <unk> life .
We 've always been trying to ask for big questions .
" What is life ? " It 's something that many <unk> , I think have <unk> to figure out at various levels .
We have tried different <unk> , <unk> to the <unk> terms .
We 're <unk> for about 20 years now .
When we <unk> the human genome , we <unk> to go from the <unk> world of biology in the digital world .
Now we 're <unk> : can we <unk> life , or create new life from this digital universe ?
This is a map of a little <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , which is the species from the <unk> genome that 's the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> that can <unk> in the lab .
And we tried to reduce the genome to <unk> one more small .
We can <unk> a <unk> of <unk> of the genes about 500 that are here .
But when you look at his <unk> map , it 's <unk> simple than our .
<unk> , this is simple .
But when we look at all the genes that we can <unk> , one at the time , is very <unk> that this can bring to a <unk> cell .
So I thought the only way to <unk> was <unk> this <unk> so that we could <unk> <unk> the <unk> to <unk> some of these questions .
And so we started the <unk> of " Can we have a <unk> ? "
Can the chemistry <unk> that we 've never been able to do before we 've never been able to do before ?
And in case , we can make a <unk> ?
A <unk> is simply a piece of <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The speed with which we 're able to <unk> life is <unk> to <unk> <unk> .
Our ability to write the genetic code , instead of <unk> rather slowly , but it 's <unk> .
And our <unk> <unk> <unk> .
We 've been over 15 years ago .
The process has <unk> a lot of <unk> , <unk> with a <unk> <unk> <unk> before we <unk> experiments .
But we found that <unk> is very difficult .
There are <unk> of thousands of cars in the world that we <unk> little <unk> of DNA , the <unk> of 30 to 50 <unk> and it 's a <unk> process . It 's <unk> .
So we had to develop a new <unk> to <unk> these <unk> and <unk> the <unk> .
And this was our first <unk> , starting from digital information of <unk> genome of <unk> <unk> <unk> .
It 's a little virus that we can <unk> .
We designed the <unk> , we <unk> the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> a DNA <unk> of about <unk> <unk> .
The interesting part is when we took this piece of <unk> material <unk> , and we <unk> it in bacteria , the bacteria have <unk> to read this code <unk> code and <unk> the <unk> particles .
<unk> particles have been <unk> by cells , they 're <unk> back and they <unk> the <unk> <unk> .
I talked about recently with members of the <unk> industry that they have certainly <unk> this model .
They have more than you .
<unk> that this is a situation where software can actually build its own <unk> in a <unk> system .
But we wanted to do the biggest things .
We wanted to build the whole <unk> of <unk> .
They 're more than <unk> <unk> <unk> .
So we thought I 'd <unk> to <unk> the size of the <unk> of the <unk> , so that we can change the <unk> to understand what are the <unk> of a <unk> cell .
<unk> is <unk> , and if you <unk> information in a computer , these have to be very <unk> .
When we <unk> this genome for the first time in <unk> , the standard <unk> was a <unk> for every 10 <unk> <unk> .
We found , <unk> , 30 <unk> . If you could use that original sequence you will never be able to do it work .
One part of the process is to design <unk> <unk> 50 <unk> that <unk> with all the other <unk> of 50 <unk> to build smaller <unk> <unk> that <unk> together .
<unk> elements here .
You probably read that you read about it .
So we have a <unk> code that we <unk> on four <unk> : A , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> and <unk>
<unk> of those <unk> <unk> <unk> together , and there 's about 20 <unk> , and there 's a <unk> order of <unk> for every <unk> .
So we can use the code for <unk> words , <unk> , <unk> .
What we did we do in the beginning was <unk> .
Some of them were <unk> by the fact that it wasn 't <unk> .
We designed these <unk> to <unk> by <unk> , just <unk> with <unk> .
There are <unk> that we <unk> them and <unk> <unk> .
And we started <unk> <unk> , <unk> with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> every step we made these <unk> in <unk> so that we can <unk> <unk> , because we 're <unk> that we 're <unk> to create a very <unk> <unk> <unk> as you 'll see in a minute .
We 're trying to <unk> the process .
So , this seems to be the <unk> of a <unk> <unk> .
When you get to these <unk> <unk> , more than 100 <unk> <unk> , you don 't get to the <unk> <unk> .
You get to the <unk> of the <unk> biology .
So we 've <unk> other <unk> .
<unk> of another <unk> called <unk> <unk> , which in biology <unk> to <unk> the DNA that can <unk> the <unk> .
Here 's an example .
This <unk> , called <unk> <unk> , can <unk> three million <unk> of <unk> .
You can see in the <unk> <unk> as his <unk> is <unk> .
In 12 -- it 's <unk> just like it was before .
<unk> thousands of organisms that are able to do it .
These organisms can completely <unk> .
You 're going to live under <unk> .
I 'm absolutely sure that life <unk> in space , and they <unk> to find new <unk> of water .
In fact , NASA <unk> showed that this happens .
This is a picture of the <unk> that we 've built these <unk> , just using these <unk> , just using the <unk> <unk> <unk> design .
<unk> <unk> <unk> them .
This is not <unk> with a <unk> <unk> , but with a <unk> <unk> .
It 's so big that we can <unk> with a <unk> <unk> .
These are pictures that <unk> a time of about six seconds .
This is the <unk> that we 've done a little bit of time ago .
They 're more than <unk> code <unk> .
It 's the biggest <unk> of a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> from man .
It 's got <unk> <unk> .
If you put it with a <unk> 10 <unk> , you 'll take pages to <unk> this code .
Now , how do we make it work ? How can we <unk> it ?
<unk> , through a virus virus is a game .
It 's a little bit more <unk> when you use of bacteria .
It 's <unk> even when it comes to a <unk> cells like our : you just <unk> the <unk> and <unk> another , which is that basically the <unk> of <unk> .
In <unk> , we <unk> the <unk> is <unk> inside the cell , but we <unk> <unk> <unk> that we are able to make a <unk> <unk> from one cell to another cell , and <unk> .
We <unk> a <unk> <unk> from a kind of <unk> .
<unk> are different as men from <unk> .
We 've <unk> some <unk> <unk> in more <unk> that we could decide which to choose what this <unk> .
He then <unk> it with <unk> so that they <unk> all the <unk> .
And when we put it in the cell was <unk> and <unk> our <unk> the new <unk> went into the new <unk> went into the cell .
And I would say we don 't want to go beyond , but we tried still <unk> in there .
This is one of the major <unk> of evolution .
We found that <unk> species have <unk> a second or a third <unk> somewhere , <unk> in a second thousands of new <unk> to that species .
So who think about evolution as one <unk> at a time that <unk> has not <unk> of the biology .
We 're going to be <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> that was in the cell didn 't <unk> one .
The <unk> <unk> that we <unk> <unk> .
It 's <unk> , and it <unk> the other <unk> as <unk> material , <unk> it , and we <unk> with only the cell and the new <unk> .
It 's become blue because of the genes that we have <unk> .
And in a short <unk> of time , all of the <unk> of a species are <unk> , and it 's <unk> of all in a new species , <unk> on the new software that we <unk> in the cell .
All the <unk> are <unk> , the <unk> are <unk> , and when you <unk> the code , you 're going to <unk> .
Now , this may seem <unk> <unk> , but by <unk> the software , we can change things in a pretty <unk> way .
Now , I 've already <unk> that 's not about <unk> -- but <unk> <unk> <unk> from three million years and a half years and a half of evolution , and I 've already said that maybe we 're going to create a new version of the <unk> <unk> that we <unk> new new species on this <unk> process .
Why do that ?
I think it 's pretty <unk> when we think about our <unk> .
We 're going to go for six and a half billion people to <unk> billion in the next 40 years .
Just to give one example : I was born in <unk> .
Now there are three people on the planet for <unk> <unk> in <unk> ; over 40 years , there 's going to be four .
We 're <unk> problems now with food , <unk> water and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and a half billion people .
We 're going to get to do it for nine billion .
<unk> more than five billion <unk> <unk> , over 30 billion <unk> .
That means 100 million <unk> a day .
When we 're trying to find <unk> <unk> , or any kind of process to <unk> , it will be a huge challenge .
In more we have to realize that the whole <unk> of CO2 from these materials that we <unk> in the atmosphere .
<unk> today , because of <unk> <unk> in the world , we have a <unk> with about 20 million genes , and I like to think that are the <unk> <unk> for the future .
The <unk> industry is only about <unk> <unk> , and you think about how many different things are <unk> out .
Our <unk> here is <unk> data from the <unk> reality and our imagination .
Now we have <unk> , because of these <unk> <unk> <unk> , able to create what we call the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
We can make a big robot that can produce a million <unk> a day .
Think of <unk> these 20 million different genes or <unk> to try to <unk> the <unk> to produce <unk> or <unk> , new <unk> , we can change , because of a little team , and create more biology now that in the last 20 years of science .
And it 's just a standard <unk> .
We can choose to <unk> , <unk> <unk> , chemistry or <unk> , production of <unk> <unk> .
This is a <unk> of some software <unk> that we 're working on for being able to <unk> and design species on computers .
Well , we don 't know <unk> how they 're going to be .
We know exactly what their <unk> code is .
Now we 're <unk> on the <unk> generation .
You 've also seen that <unk> <unk> from the <unk> was an experiment .
We 've <unk> <unk> <unk> and third generation that we 're going to <unk> enough enough to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> or different kinds of <unk> .
But the only way that biology can have a great impact without <unk> the food cost of food and <unk> the <unk> would be CO2 as the CO2 as we 're working on to design cells that are going to be this , and we can have this purpose to design that are the first <unk> of <unk> in about 18 months .
<unk> <unk> is a <unk> , but in our <unk> <unk> , in our <unk> <unk> around the world , we found different <unk> .
This is a <unk> that we <unk> in the <unk> .
It 's about <unk> feet deep at the <unk> of <unk> water .
We 're <unk> by CO2 using hydrogen <unk> as a source of energy .
We 're trying to figure out whether we can <unk> CO2 , that can easily be <unk> through <unk> , <unk> that CO2 in <unk> , to drive this process .
So , very short we think that we could be able to <unk> what the basic question is that we , " what is life " is , we <unk> , we have the <unk> goal of <unk> the whole industry .
<unk> . If you can 't do it from TED , where can you ?
It 's a major source of energy .
<unk> , we 're working on using the same <unk> to create <unk> <unk> .
You saw this year with flu , we 're always back a year and with a dollar in less when it 's about it finding the right .
I think that what you can do is to <unk> <unk> in <unk> .
So that 's how the future could start to look <unk> , now , the tree of evolution , <unk> evolution with bacteria , <unk> , and finally <unk> cells .
We 're so <unk> to <unk> people .
Our goal is to do so so we 're going to be <unk> enough to try to <unk> it . Thank you very much .
<unk> I 'm going to show you , the <unk> possible , some <unk> work , a new technology that we brought to the <unk> <unk> to a <unk> almost a year ago . This is <unk> .
It 's a environment that you can <unk> is <unk> with a huge <unk> of <unk> data .
We 're seeing <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> with a kind of <unk> <unk> and <unk> , for a fast <unk> , we <unk> the images as we want .
And it doesn 't matter how big the amount of information that we see , how big it is these <unk> of data or images .
Most of them are <unk> photographs , but this is a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> in the <unk> <unk> , and <unk> in the <unk> <unk> .
It 's not going to make any difference because the only thing that you <unk> the <unk> of a system like this is the number of <unk> on your screen at any time . It 's also a very <unk> architecture .
This is a book , example of data not images .
This is the <unk> <unk> <unk> . Every <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And to <unk> that it 's just about <unk> and not images , we can do something like that , to actually see it 's a real <unk> of the text , not of a picture .
It may be a way of <unk> to read a little <unk> book .
You don 't <unk> it .
This is a more <unk> example . This is a <unk> number of <unk> .
Every image is the beginning of a <unk> .
And it really gives you the pleasure and the beautiful experience of reading the real version of a <unk> or a <unk> , which is for nature a <unk> kind of a <unk> <unk> .
We also have something with the <unk> of this particular number , in particular <unk> .
We 've created a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> than what you use in a normal <unk> , and we <unk> you <unk> of the content .
If you want to see the <unk> of this <unk> , you can see it here .
Or other models , or even <unk> <unk> .
And this really <unk> some of these ideas to <unk> the <unk> of space on the screen .
We want this to put in <unk> and <unk> <unk> and other <unk> <unk> , not to be <unk> .
Of course , the <unk> is one of the most <unk> <unk> for this kind of technology .
And on this , I don 't want to lose time , if not to say that we have <unk> <unk> to give it to this field .
These are all the streets in the United States <unk> <unk> above an <unk> image .
So I 'm going to start with something else .
This is actually live on the web ; you can see it .
It 's a project called <unk> , which <unk> two different technologies .
One is <unk> and the other is a <unk> research that 's very interesting that made by <unk> <unk> , a <unk> student of Washington , with the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> . <unk> <unk> .
And it 's alive on the web , <unk> <unk> .
You can <unk> when we do this kind of <unk> , where we can go from one image to the other and have this kind of experience that <unk> <unk> .
But the <unk> <unk> of the images here actually actually has meaning .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and these pictures , so that you get to the places that <unk> <unk> where the <unk> <unk> all <unk> <unk> on the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . <unk> have been <unk> . So here you see some kind of <unk> <unk> , and these things are all <unk> at the <unk> level .
I don 't know if I 've got time to show you some other environment .
There are much more <unk> .
I want to go directly to one of the <unk> of <unk> data , and this <unk> from a <unk> <unk> <unk> that we 've made for the first time , we 're going to work right behind this technology , the <unk> technology , <unk> . And it 's not <unk> . And it 's not <unk> by looking so that we 're going to have in the website .
We had to <unk> some <unk> and <unk> .
This is a <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> . <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> and <unk> images of <unk> in <unk> , <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> images , and so on . You can see these <unk> <unk> <unk> .
So they 're all <unk> images and <unk> and they 're all <unk> at the <unk> level like this .
And it 's possible to <unk> this <unk> way .
You know , I would never have thought of <unk> to work for <unk> .
It 's very <unk> <unk> <unk> .
I think we 're going to see that it 's a lot of different kinds of <unk> : from the <unk> of cell phones , a <unk> number , <unk> in this environment .
And if I can , I can , I <unk> to look for those <unk> .
Many are <unk> by <unk> , etc .
<unk> here is a series of photographs -- <unk> .
This is a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
We can go from the <unk> to <unk> physics of this environment .
The <unk> point is that we can do some of the social environment . This is now <unk> from <unk> data from the whole memory of how we <unk> the earth , from the point of view <unk> and <unk> all that data together .
All those pictures become <unk> together , greater than the <unk> of the parts .
You have a model of the whole <unk> that you <unk> .
Think of this as the <unk> of the work of <unk> <unk> on Earth <unk> .
It 's something that 's <unk> in <unk> complexity as people <unk> it , and the <unk> that you 're going to <unk> it with the use .
Their pictures are <unk> with <unk> <unk> from other people .
If somebody comes the idea of <unk> , all these <unk> <unk> , I 'll be <unk> of <unk> <unk> , you know , my picture of <unk> <unk> , you know , you can use it as a <unk> point in that space , in that <unk> , in that <unk> , using the pictures of anyone else , and have a social experience .
Of course , a <unk> of all this is <unk> <unk> models of every interesting part of the earth , <unk> not just by <unk> <unk> and <unk> images and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> images .
Thank you very much .
Chris Anderson : I got it right ? What your software your own <unk> to do is that at some point , in the next few years , all the photographs that we 're in the world , are going to be <unk> <unk> ?
<unk> : Yes . What 's doing is basically to discover .
It 's creating <unk> , if you want , between images .
And it 's <unk> it 's <unk> .
What it becomes very interesting if you think about the <unk> of information that many of these <unk> images .
As you do a research images on the web , you <unk> a <unk> and the text on the page , has a lot of information about images .
Now , what happens if that picture is going on , if that picture is going on , what happens if that picture is it <unk> to all your pictures ?
So the amount of <unk> <unk> and the amount of <unk> that <unk> is really enormous . It 's a <unk> effect .
CA : <unk> , it 's really incredible . <unk> .
<unk> : I 'll tell you a lot .
One of the main <unk> when you <unk> and one of the <unk> research is that they can live in who has not <unk> the <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
You might think that <unk> <unk> are still <unk> <unk> , or that <unk> <unk> <unk> are still <unk> <unk> , or that <unk> <unk> are still <unk> of <unk> , or <unk> , the <unk> will still <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> , and that the idea that the world in which we live in in which is not <unk> , but it 's just a model of reality ,
the <unk> of a particular <unk> of <unk> choices that our <unk> has done , good or evil , many <unk> .
And of course , we all <unk> of the <unk> <unk> .
Everybody <unk> . <unk> <unk> .
We 're <unk> to <unk> <unk> .
We have to deal with the death <unk> , so we don 't <unk> it if we <unk> and <unk> --
We all have an art .
What <unk> is the <unk> of the song , the <unk> of every culture 's <unk> .
It doesn 't matter that <unk> are the <unk> of the <unk> , or the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , or the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , or the <unk> of the <unk> , or a <unk> in the heart of the <unk> .
He was my <unk> of journey in <unk> a month ago , or a <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> , on the <unk> , the <unk> mother of the world .
All of these <unk> are <unk> that there are other ways of <unk> other ways of thinking , other ways of moving around the world .
And if you 're going to take a second , it 's a concept that can give you hope .
<unk> , the <unk> <unk> of the world create a <unk> of <unk> life and <unk> that <unk> the planet and is important for the <unk> of the planet as the <unk> <unk> .
And you can think about this <unk> <unk> as a <unk> and you can <unk> the <unk> <unk> of all the <unk> , dreams , <unk> , <unk> , ideas , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> in being the human imagination of the <unk> .
<unk> is the great <unk> of humanity .
It 's the <unk> of what we are and what we can be as <unk> species .
And <unk> <unk> was <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> was <unk> at <unk> and <unk> very <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , for example , <unk> that 50 percent of all species has been or is on the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> , just because it 's <unk> , or -- in the <unk> <unk> -- in the field of diversity -- and not <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> -- that of the diversity .
The <unk> of this is , of course , the <unk> <unk> .
When you 're <unk> <unk> <unk> on this planet .
A language is not just <unk> by a <unk> or a series of rules .
A language is the <unk> of human spirit .
It 's the middle that the <unk> of every culture is coming in the material world .
Every language is a forest of the mind , a <unk> , a thought , a <unk> of <unk> possibilities .
And of those <unk> <unk> , as we 're sitting here at least half it 's no longer <unk> in the <unk> of the kids .
They 're not going to be <unk> to children , which means that , unless you know something , they 're already dead .
What 's more <unk> than being <unk> by the <unk> , of being the last last to talk about a language , of not having a way of <unk> the <unk> of <unk> or <unk> the kids ?
This <unk> <unk> is the state of somebody in the world every two weeks : every two weeks , a <unk> <unk> and <unk> with itself in the <unk> <unk> the <unk> of the language <unk> .
And I know some of you who are going to say , " <unk> 't it better ?
The world wouldn 't be a better place if we all have the same language ? " <unk> , then we 're all talking about it . <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> .
<unk> a <unk> thing that means not to talk about its own language .
I 'd like to give you a journey through the <unk> --
a little journey in the <unk> to give you a <unk> of what we 're <unk> .
Many of us <unk> that when I say " different ways of <unk> " I mean different ways of <unk> . "
<unk> for example , this <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , the <unk> of <unk> , which <unk> <unk> <unk> from the <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
It 's a <unk> that 's not able to <unk> the blue color in the green because the <unk> is <unk> in the <unk> of the forest , which we <unk> the <unk> .
They have a <unk> language and a <unk> rule , <unk> , <unk> , " <unk> <unk> , " <unk> " : you have to <unk> a different language .
And this has been <unk> in the past <unk> , but the <unk> is that in these <unk> families that you 're talking about six or seven <unk> because of the <unk> <unk> <unk> nobody 's <unk> .
You start to listen and then you start talking to him .
<unk> one of the most interesting <unk> that I 've lived , the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , an incredible <unk> that has had the first <unk> in <unk> .
In <unk> , five <unk> have <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
They 've been <unk> by the top photographs that <unk> them in <unk> that <unk> <unk> , which this <unk> of the <unk> forest had never seen anything .
They <unk> the pictures from the ground , have <unk> to <unk> a form or a <unk> , not <unk> anything , have <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> , and they <unk> the five <unk> with the <unk> .
But <unk> not just <unk> the <unk> .
They 're <unk> with each other .
<unk> percent of <unk> <unk> was <unk> by their own .
We 're <unk> to eight <unk> and found two <unk> <unk> and when we <unk> to know , they <unk> that one of them was <unk> so that he died , and then they <unk> it . They <unk> the same . [ <unk> ] anyway . But anyway , they had an incredible <unk> of the forest .
<unk> were able to recognize the animal <unk> from 40 <unk> and to <unk> the species .
In the early <unk> , I was <unk> a very interesting job when my <unk> <unk> <unk> me , if I wanted to go to <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
To make sense of <unk> , I should have understand culture <unk> and that <unk> is not <unk> <unk> .
It 's pretty much of a <unk> <unk> view of the world .
Very interesting .
If you 're going to tell you about <unk> the great <unk> of the world , what would you like ?
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , etc .
A continent comes out , thinking about <unk> Africa has not <unk> <unk> . And so yes and the <unk> is not the <unk> of these <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> during the <unk> <unk> .
What makes the <unk> is the <unk> relationship between life and death .
So <unk> <unk> are <unk> the <unk> .
<unk> can be <unk> by the <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of the live in a way , the <unk> becomes the <unk> .
So , the <unk> <unk> , " <unk> go to <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> to talk about God .
We <unk> in <unk> and <unk> God . "
And from the moment that you 're <unk> , is the spirit that you can 't <unk> you , you can <unk> you <unk> ?
So , you 're <unk> to these incredible events : <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> all the <unk> that I have lived with which I 've lived with the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , in the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> of <unk> civilization <unk> that once <unk> on the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> <unk> on the <unk> <unk> .
In a blood continent , <unk> , this <unk> has never been <unk> by the <unk> .
In <unk> , I 'm <unk> by a <unk> , but their <unk> is extraordinary .
<unk> <unk> are <unk> from <unk> to families to three or four years , and they 're living in a world <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> for 18 years .
Two <unk> <unk> years old <unk> of nine years <unk> that <unk> in the <unk> of <unk> that <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> .
For all this time , they 're <unk> to the values of their society , values that they <unk> that their <unk> and only <unk> <unk> <unk> -- or to say <unk> <unk> .
And then the <unk> of this incredible <unk> , they 're <unk> out and the first time in their life , at the age of 18 , see an <unk> . And in that moment of the first <unk> , when the sun <unk> <unk> the <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , all that they have been learned in theory in the <unk> . <unk> does a <unk> say , and says ,
" <unk> ? I 'm going to <unk> as I said .
It 's <unk> . Now it 's <unk> . "
It 's got to be more and they say that we , <unk> <unk> , we are the <unk> of the <unk> of the world .
This is extremely important .
When we think about <unk> <unk> and the environment <unk> <unk> and the old history of <unk> <unk> , which is a concept in its <unk> or maybe <unk> <unk> <unk> and say that these <unk> are closer to Earth .
<unk> <unk> are not <unk> or <unk> <unk> .
There is no space for these things in the <unk> <unk> of <unk> or in the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> , but <unk> , and <unk> , have created a <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , but on a more <unk> <unk> : the concept that the Earth can live only because it 's <unk> by human consciousness .
What does that mean ?
Let me say that a <unk> of the <unk> that we <unk> that the mountain is a spirit <unk> that <unk> its <unk> will be a human being <unk> <unk> different and will have a very different relationship with the mountain or that place , as a <unk> <unk> that <unk> a mountain is a <unk> <unk> to be <unk> .
<unk> is a spirit or a <unk> <unk> is <unk> .
What 's interesting is the <unk> that <unk> the relationship between <unk> and the natural world .
I grew up in the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> to be <unk> .
That made me be a human being different from my <unk> friends who believe that <unk> are the <unk> of <unk> and the <unk> <unk> of <unk> and the <unk> <unk> of <unk> and the <unk> <unk> that live in the world 's <unk> , we <unk> in the <unk> <unk> .
If you 're going to <unk> that these <unk> can actually create different , we could actually start to understand some of their <unk> <unk> .
I <unk> this picture in <unk> in the <unk> <unk> .
Maybe some of you have heard about <unk> , the most powerful <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> .
What makes the <unk> is not the <unk> potential of the <unk> , but his <unk> . It 's <unk> by two elements .
On one hand , this <unk> <unk> that has a series of <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
<unk> the only <unk> is <unk> a little bit of <unk> , but it 's <unk> with the <unk> of a <unk> 's family <unk> said <unk> .
This <unk> <unk> <unk> , very similar to the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
If you ever see the <unk> <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> that are <unk> on the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , it <unk> <unk> .
<unk> that <unk> on the <unk> is a little bit of like being <unk> by a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> on a sea of electricity . <unk> 't creates <unk> . <unk> 't creates a <unk> of the reality of the <unk> .
I often <unk> with my <unk> , Richard <unk> <unk> , the man who <unk> the age of <unk> <unk> , with his discovery of the <unk> <unk> in the ' <unk> .
<unk> my <unk> is not <unk> these <unk> as <unk> because if you 're done , you can 't tell anybody who 's <unk> . <unk> <unk> 't , but <unk> <unk> can 't be <unk> because they 're <unk> by a <unk> that is , of course in the <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
It 's possible to <unk> <unk> only if you <unk> with other <unk> <unk> that <unk> .
Now , the <unk> <unk> that are <unk> in this <unk> are <unk> <unk> , <unk> of the same kind of necessary to <unk> the <unk> . The question <unk> <unk> : in a <unk> of <unk> species of plants , how do these <unk> <unk> to <unk> two <unk> , they don 't similar , but if you <unk> in this way , they make a <unk> version that 's <unk> on the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the parts ?
We use the great <unk> of <unk> and <unk> , which can <unk> <unk> .
But if you go to the <unk> , we 'll <unk> , we 'll <unk> , " <unk> <unk> . "
What does that mean ?
This <unk> , the <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , which <unk> <unk> in the forest , and that our eyes <unk> in the same species .
If you <unk> it as they <unk> their <unk> will tell us , " <unk> <unk> , " <unk> " <unk> " <unk> " <unk> " <unk> . "
The solution is : you take the <unk> <unk> in a night moon at a <unk> <unk> and <unk> with a different <unk> .
With this not <unk> , you don 't <unk> , but it 's much more interesting than <unk> <unk> .
Now , [ <unk> ] The problem is that the ones of us that have to the heart <unk> <unk> are <unk> , but somehow <unk> to the <unk> of history than our real world , and beyond .
In fact , the <unk> century , over 300 years , not <unk> <unk> for its <unk> or its <unk> <unk> , but rather as the age that we <unk> and <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , or <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> of diversity and <unk> and <unk> on the planet . Now the problem is not the change .
All <unk> through the <unk> have been <unk> in a <unk> for new possibilities of life .
And the problem is not technology .
<unk> <unk> don 't have <unk> to be <unk> when they put <unk> and <unk> <unk> as <unk> don 't have <unk> to be <unk> when they put <unk> and <unk> .
It 's not the change or technology that <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> . It 's the power .
The <unk> <unk> of <unk> .
And if you look at the world , you 'll see that these are not <unk> <unk> to <unk> .
They 're <unk> creatures and <unk> <unk> out of existence by <unk> forces that go beyond their <unk> <unk> .
<unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> --
a <unk> <unk> <unk> , in the <unk> <unk> , a <unk> that has been <unk> in the forest to a generation of <unk> , and now <unk> to the <unk> and the <unk> on the <unk> of the <unk> , where you can see the <unk> <unk> from the <unk> that seems to <unk> <unk> <unk> , where the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , where the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , where the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> ,
We 're going to <unk> the <unk> with the <unk> <unk> to the forest .
Or , in the case of <unk> , it 's the disease that are <unk> with the discovery of <unk> .
If you 're <unk> on the <unk> of the <unk> , where I 'm doing a lot of research , you 'll see the <unk> <unk> of politics .
As you <unk> the <unk> , the physics of a <unk> , is <unk> at the <unk> level , but <unk> , the <unk> of <unk> <unk> , not only is it 's <unk> , but <unk> <unk> in certain <unk> , because it 's part of development .
And you can 't understand the <unk> of the <unk> until you <unk> from the beginning .
I <unk> <unk> miles from <unk> in China through the <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> to <unk> with a young <unk> , but only come to <unk> , I realized what the <unk> is behind .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> million people <unk> from the <unk> during the <unk> <unk> .
The father of this guy was <unk> at <unk> <unk> .
Which means that it was <unk> at the time of Chinese <unk> .
<unk> <unk> is <unk> with <unk> <unk> during the <unk> who brought the <unk> in <unk> .
My mother was <unk> and his <unk> was <unk> .
It 's been brought to <unk> in <unk> at age age of two <unk> years in his <unk> because he couldn 't have been able to live without him .
The <unk> , who did the same , was <unk> in <unk> <unk> .
One day he <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> and , for this <unk> , was <unk> to the work <unk> for seven years .
The <unk> of <unk> can be <unk> , but the spirit of the <unk> of the <unk> is from the present .
And then , all they <unk> to a choice .
Do you want to live in the <unk> world or we want to <unk> the <unk> of diversity of the diversity of the diversity of the diversity of ?
The great <unk> <unk> <unk> , before he died , he said that his biggest fear was that , in our going to this <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of human imagination to a <unk> <unk> of human imagination to a <unk> <unk> of thinking , but a day we <unk> us from a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that there were other possibilities .
And it 's <unk> to remember that our species has been <unk> for <unk> years .
The <unk> <unk> , who gave us <unk> , which made us <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> , <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> with the <unk> of the <unk> , creating the <unk> of <unk> , and we talk about <unk> years ago .
The <unk> world has <unk> 300 years .
That <unk> story , I don 't tell you that we have answers to all the challenges that we 're going to <unk> in the <unk> to come .
When these <unk> <unk> of the world is asked what it means to be human , we 're <unk> with <unk> different <unk> .
And it 's in these answers that we all <unk> the possibilities of being what we are , a <unk> species , which has to <unk> the <unk> and all the <unk> can <unk> . And there are great moments of <unk> .
I <unk> this picture on the north of <unk> , in the island of <unk> , when I went to <unk> <unk> with <unk> , and this man , <unk> , he <unk> me the wonderful story of his <unk> .
The <unk> government has not been always <unk> with the <unk> <unk> and in the ' <unk> to <unk> our <unk> , we <unk> it in <unk> .
The <unk> of this man <unk> <unk> .
The family , <unk> for his life , <unk> <unk> the <unk> away all the <unk> , and all his <unk> .
You want to know that <unk> don 't <unk> the cold , they <unk> it .
The <unk> <unk> were made of <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> of this man didn 't <unk> <unk> or <unk> from the <unk> .
It 's <unk> away , it <unk> the <unk> in the skin of <unk> and <unk> in your hand . When I did it , they <unk> it , it <unk> it <unk> .
He <unk> <unk> on the <unk> of this <unk> <unk> , and when <unk> <unk> , he <unk> a dog .
He <unk> the dog and created a <unk> , with the <unk> <unk> <unk> created a <unk> , has <unk> another dog and it 's <unk> on the <unk> , <unk> <unk> in <unk> .
<unk> to talk about <unk> ? [ <unk> ] And this , in different ways , [ <unk> ] [ is the ] <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> and all the world 's <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> government <unk> to <unk> the <unk> of a bigger area of California and <unk> <unk> together .
It 's their new <unk> . It 's called <unk> .
It 's a <unk> <unk> . It <unk> all the <unk> <unk> .
One <unk> example of how a <unk> can <unk> with his <unk> .
And , finally , I think it 's pretty <unk> at least who is <unk> in these <unk> <unk> of the planet , that they realize that they 're not not <unk> .
For someone is home .
<unk> <unk> of the human imagination that <unk> to the <unk> of the time . And for us all , the dreams of these kids , like dreams of our children , become part of the <unk> hope of the <unk> .
<unk> , we <unk> <unk> , we <unk> <unk> we <unk> that <unk> never <unk> to nothing .
I want to say that <unk> --
<unk> <unk> are not <unk> , but we believe that stories can change the world , and maybe we 're the best stories to tell the world stories . Every month our website <unk> <unk> million <unk> .
<unk> <unk> : <unk> <unk> our <unk> <unk> .
Our <unk> are <unk> by millions of people .
Our work is <unk> in the <unk> to bring our public in places that we have <unk> <unk> from what they were <unk> by <unk> , and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , the world of <unk> <unk> , the <unk> world of <unk> in diversity , and we have to find a <unk> <unk> in a <unk> world and <unk> <unk> .
where we <unk> of all <unk> can <unk> to our <unk> <unk> .
Thank you .
I 'm going to talk about some of the things that I wrote in this book that I hope you 've heard about and <unk> a few <unk> , in case you don 't .
I want to start with what I call the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> of what ?
The <unk> <unk> of all <unk> societies . The <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> : " If we want to <unk> the <unk> of our citizens , " The way to do it is to <unk> freedom . "
The reason is , on one side , in the fact that freedom is in itself a value , is <unk> , <unk> for human beings .
On the other one is that if we 're <unk> , each of us can act to do for all that we 're going to <unk> our <unk> , without anybody who 's going to do that we don 't know that we 're going to change our own <unk> .
The way to <unk> the freedom is to <unk> choice .
More choices people , more <unk> are <unk> , and more <unk> is their <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> is their <unk> .
This is , <unk> , it 's so <unk> <unk> in society that no one <unk> <unk> in <unk> .
And it 's also <unk> <unk> in our lives .
I 'm going to show you some examples of what progress has made possible .
This is my <unk> . It 's not particularly big .
I got a simple note on the <unk> to <unk> .
In my <unk> , there are <unk> <unk> , without <unk> the 10 <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> and the 12 <unk> you can buy a huge number of <unk> in the <unk> <unk> that no one of the <unk> <unk> <unk> that no one of the <unk> <unk> is <unk> .
That 's what the <unk> is .
And then you go to the <unk> store for buy a <unk> : <unk> , radio , <unk> , <unk> , radio , <unk> , <unk> .
And in this single <unk> store , there 's a great number of <unk> <unk> .
We can do six and a half million different <unk> using the <unk> that there are in one store .
<unk> <unk> that there is <unk> choice .
<unk> <unk> : the world of <unk> .
Once , when I was a child , you could get all the services <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> who were <unk> by <unk> <unk> .
You <unk> the phone , you know , you 're not going to <unk> .
A <unk> of that , by the way , was that the phone never <unk> .
These days they went .
We have now a <unk> <unk> <unk> , especially between cell cell phones .
Here 's cell phones .
My <unk> is in the middle , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , and <unk> for <unk> <unk> .
If you haven 't seen it in the store yet , you 're very soon <unk> that you 're going to be <unk> .
And what 's the answer is that people <unk> in the <unk> and ask this question . And you know what 's the answer is , " No . "
It 's not possible to buy a mobile phone that doesn 't do <unk> .
So , in other <unk> of life that are much more important than <unk> , <unk> the same <unk> of choices .
<unk> <unk> : <unk> , no longer happens in the United States that you 're going to be <unk> from the <unk> and the <unk> you what you have to do .
Instead , you get out of the <unk> , and the <unk> says , " OK , could do it , or " A , you know , " <unk> " <unk> " <unk> " <unk> " <unk> " <unk> " <unk> " <unk> " <unk> " <unk> " <unk> " <unk> " <unk> " <unk> " <unk> " <unk> , " <unk> , " <unk> , " <unk> , " <unk> , you know , " OK , you know
You were <unk> , " <unk> , what do you want to do ? "
And the <unk> says , " <unk> these <unk> and <unk> , and <unk> has these <unk> and <unk> . "
" What do you want to do ? "
And you say , " <unk> if you were me , what would you say ? "
And the <unk> : " But I 'm not her . "
We call the " <unk> " <unk> " <unk> " , " <unk> " , " <unk> " <unk> " , " <unk> " <unk> " , " <unk> " , " <unk> " , " <unk> " , " <unk> " , " <unk> " , " <unk> <unk> " , " <unk> " , " <unk> <unk> . "
But it 's not that one <unk> the weight and responsibility to make decisions from someone who knows something , you know , <unk> the <unk> , to <unk> that <unk> , to <unk> something that doesn 't know -- and it 's almost certainly <unk> -- and so in the <unk> to make decisions about patient .
There 's a huge <unk> of <unk> products , <unk> to people like me and you , if you think about it doesn 't make any sense , because we can 't <unk> .
But if we can 't <unk> , why can we get them ?
The answer is they want to <unk> that we call the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> as a <unk> is our <unk> now is a question of choice , as you see in this <unk> , " We don 't want to <unk> kids . <unk> their sex at the right time . " We don 't <unk> any more <unk> : we have to <unk> it .
And we can <unk> how many times we <unk> .
Which means that every <unk> , <unk> to the <unk> , you have to decide what kind of person is .
<unk> to the family and <unk> , a time time perspective , we 're almost almost for anybody , was that was that <unk> <unk> as soon as possible , and you could get kids as soon as possible .
The only real choice was with who , not when , and not even what to do next .
<unk> , it 's really to play .
We 're going to be <unk> , <unk> students , 20 percent of the work less than a time .
And not because they 're less <unk> , not because they 're less <unk> .
But why are I <unk> , I 'll start to <unk> , " <unk> <unk> or not ? "
" <unk> <unk> <unk> ? " I have to think about <unk> or career ? "
They 're <unk> <unk> .
And they try to answer these questions , even though this is not going to be the <unk> that we <unk> and not get a beautiful <unk> to my <unk> .
And they really have to do that . They 're important questions .
Now , the work : we 're <unk> , as <unk> <unk> , because technology technology <unk> us to work every minute , from every day , on the planet , we 'll see that from the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , there is a <unk> , and I 'm not going to say one , where the <unk> works .
I don 't say that , because I want to use it .
What does this incredible choice of choice that we have about this ? It 's that we have to do this <unk> ? It 's that we have to <unk> or not .
We can go to see our son to play <unk> , with the mobile phone in one <unk> , the <unk> in the other , and the <unk> , <unk> , on the <unk> .
And even if I 'm all <unk> , every minute that we see our son , we 're also <unk> , " I have to answer this call ? "
" I have to answer this <unk> ? I have to <unk> this letter ? "
And even when the answer is , " no , that makes the experience of the <unk> of your son very different from what would be in other conditions .
So , from any <unk> , you know , little things , small and big objects and <unk> and <unk> , life is a question of choices .
Once the world was this : <unk> , there were some possibilities , but not everything was a question of choice .
The world today is <unk> to this : The <unk> is , " Is it a <unk> thing , or <unk> ? "
The answer is <unk> .
<unk> <unk> we all know , so I 'm going to talk about the <unk> .
<unk> this choice <unk> two effects effects effects of people .
The first , <unk> , is that <unk> rather than <unk> .
With a lot of <unk> between which choice , it becomes very difficult to do it .
So , you 're going to give you an example : a study <unk> <unk> <unk> .
A <unk> of my <unk> has been access to <unk> data , <unk> society , with about a million <unk> <unk> in different companies .
What she discovered is that for every 10 <unk> that are <unk> , the <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> two percent .
With 50 <unk> <unk> , there 's 10 percent less than <unk> when you 're available to only five . Why ?
Because with 50 <unk> between which <unk> , it 's hard to decide , and the choice is <unk> to the <unk> .
And in <unk> , and again , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and of course <unk> , <unk> , and of course <unk> never comes .
<unk> that doesn 't mean just that it doesn 't just mean that these <unk> <unk> food for <unk> because they don 't have enough money , it 's also about saying that the decision is so <unk> that they 're also <unk> the <unk> of work .
They 're not going to be <unk> , they 're <unk> <unk> for <unk> year from the work , which would be <unk> <unk> to <unk> .
So the <unk> is a <unk> of having <unk> choices .
And I think we 're going to change the world like this .
" And finally , to <unk> : <unk> , <unk> , <unk> or <unk> ? "
You 're going to be the right decision , if it 's for <unk> , right ?
You don 't want to choose the wrong <unk> , and you 'll get the wrong <unk> .
So this is the first effect . The second one is that even if we can <unk> the <unk> and make a choice , finally we 're <unk> from the result of how to <unk> .
And that 's for several reasons .
One of these is that with many <unk> between which choice , if you <unk> one and it 's not perfect , it 's very easy to imagine that they could make a different choice that would be better . And what 's going on is that the <unk> <unk> us to <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> <unk> from <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> <unk> ,
even when it was a <unk> decision .
<unk> more choices , there are , more choices , which is easier than any <unk> that it 's <unk> .
<unk> , there is what <unk> call .
Dan <unk> has <unk> very well <unk> like the value that we give things things to what we do .
<unk> rest , when you have a lot of <unk> possible , it 's easy to <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> and be less <unk> of the <unk> that 's choice .
Here 's an example . I 'm <unk> with all the ones that are not in New York .
But that 's what 's probably <unk> .
There 's this <unk> <unk> .
A place of <unk> .
<unk> <unk> . <unk> day . It 's all about them .
It 's not going to be anything . But what he thinks is , " Well , <unk> , it 's <unk> . "
" All my <unk> <unk> are away . "
" <unk> <unk> <unk> in front of the home . "
And it <unk> two weeks from the idea that 's going to <unk> -- every day -- the chance of <unk> where it wants .
The <unk> <unk> for what we have , even when the choice was <unk> .
And the more of the <unk> we 've been <unk> , the more <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> on how to <unk> .
Here 's another example .
This <unk> tells us a lot of things .
It 's about living the moment , and maybe live slowly .
But the most important thing is that you 're going to <unk> , you 're not going to do other .
The things that don 't <unk> have a lot of <unk> that can make less <unk> what we do .
<unk> <unk> : <unk> <unk> <unk> .
I tried it on my skin <unk> <unk> a new couple of <unk> .
It 's almost always <unk> .
Once the <unk> were in one , they <unk> them and <unk> from <unk> , they were <unk> , only after <unk> , they had a life and <unk> a lot of times , we <unk> to go well .
So , I went to <unk> a couple of <unk> when the <unk> went , and I said , " I need a couple of <unk> , this is my <unk> . "
The <unk> said , " Do you want to <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> ? "
You want them to <unk> or with <unk> ? " <unk> " or " <unk> " or " <unk> " ?
" Do you want them to <unk> ? "
" <unk> wants to <unk> or <unk> ? <unk> <unk> <unk> -- " <unk> to <unk> .
I was <unk> , and after a little bit , I was able to say , " I want the guy -- that was the only guy , " had no idea what it was , so for an hour , I <unk> all <unk> <unk> , and then <unk> from the store , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , with the best <unk> I ever had .
I was the <unk> . With all that choice , I 'd <unk> the best .
But I 'm going to get worse .
Why ? I wrote a whole book for <unk> .
And the reason I was worse is that with all that choice my <unk> were <unk> , the <unk> <unk> to be <unk> .
I had <unk> <unk> . I didn 't <unk> anything about <unk> when I just <unk> a guy , but when I <unk> 100 different , you know , at least one , you had to be perfect .
What I 'd <unk> was good , but not perfect .
After <unk> , I <unk> with what I was <unk> in <unk> to <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> in the lives of people don 't make <unk> that <unk> that these have <unk> <unk> that these <unk> <unk> .
And this is <unk> <unk> , even when the results are good .
<unk> in the world of the <unk> if they realize it .
Because if you <unk> it , I don 't know what I 'm talking about .
The truth is more than that .
" It was better when it was worse , " The reason it was better when it was worse is that when it was worse , it was <unk> that you could even <unk> <unk> .
<unk> , in the world that we live in -- <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , the <unk> that we can <unk> is that things are at the <unk> of the <unk> .
You 've never never never <unk> <unk> because your <unk> , my <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> of happiness -- what you 're here -- is , " <unk> <unk> , " Yes , you want it to . "
I mean -- little <unk> moment -- that I 'm really <unk> and my wife is really <unk> .
I couldn 't do that , I didn 't have to do it .
But <unk> not always is <unk> .
<unk> , a <unk> of <unk> <unk> , when you have a couple of <unk> <unk> when there is just that kind of <unk> is that when you 're not <unk> , and you say , " Why ? "
" Who is <unk> ? " <unk> is <unk> .
The world is <unk> . What can I do do I could do it ?
When you have hundreds of <unk> <unk> , and you get one <unk> , and you <unk> one <unk> , and you 'll <unk> who is the <unk> , it 's clear that you are .
You could have it better .
With hundreds of <unk> <unk> , there are no <unk> for <unk> .
So when people make decisions , even if it 's <unk> , it 's <unk> , they 're <unk> <unk> and they 're going to <unk> them .
In the last few years , the <unk> is <unk> in the <unk> world .
I think a <unk> <unk> -- not the only , but important -- of this <unk> of <unk> is that people have <unk> experiences because the standard is too <unk> .
And when they have to <unk> this situation they think they 're <unk> .
So the final result is that we 're better , <unk> , <unk> , but we 're worse .
Let me tell you .
This is the <unk> <unk> , what we all take for good and is completely <unk> . It 's not true .
There is no <unk> that a little bit of choice is better than <unk> that you don 't know that much choice is a little bit better than a little bit .
There 's a <unk> value , <unk> . I don 't know what it is .
But I 'm sure we 've <unk> from a piece of the level where the choices <unk> our lives .
Now , from a <unk> point -- I 'm almost done -- from a <unk> point of view , the <unk> is the <unk> .
What <unk> all this choice in society is the <unk> material .
There are many places in the world , and you have to <unk> <unk> , where the problem is not that they have <unk> choice .
The problem is they have too <unk> .
So the <unk> I 'm talking about is a <unk> <unk> of <unk> , <unk> societies .
And what <unk> does <unk> and <unk> is this : <unk> <unk> <unk> you yesterday about how much those <unk> and <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> are <unk> . It 's a <unk> <unk> .
I mean , these choices , <unk> and <unk> , is not just that they 're <unk> .
They 're <unk> <unk> .
They make us worse .
If you 're a little bit of what in our society <unk> <unk> to be <unk> in those where people have too few <unk> , it wouldn 't just be their life to <unk> <unk> , but our .
This is what <unk> call a <unk> <unk> .
A <unk> of income is good for everybody -- not just the poor -- because of this choice in <unk> that we 're <unk> .
To close , " <unk> , you can become everything you want to --
<unk> , people of culture , <unk> : " What 's going to do you know that fish ? "
" It 's <unk> that you can 't do anything in a <unk> <unk> . "
" A <unk> imagination , a <unk> <unk> vision of the world --
and I <unk> it so , at the beginning .
But then , <unk> , I made that fish that 's going to know that that fish <unk> knows it .
Because the reality of the fact of the <unk> is that if you <unk> the <unk> , so that it 's possible , " you can 't <unk> the freedom . You <unk> the <unk> .
If you <unk> the <unk> so that it 's <unk> possible to <unk> the <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Everybody needs a <unk> .
This is almost certainly too <unk> , maybe even for the fish , and it 's certainly about the fish , and it 's certainly .
But the <unk> of some <unk> <unk> is a <unk> for <unk> and , <unk> , for <unk> .
Thank you very much .
