<unk> year I showed these <unk> to <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , which for almost three million years had had the size of the United States , <unk> <unk> , <unk> percent of the United States , <unk> , <unk> 40 percent .
And we <unk> this <unk> the <unk> of the problem because it 's not <unk> the ice <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> is , in a way , the heart <unk> of climate system .
<unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The next <unk> will be a <unk> <unk> on the last 25 years .
<unk> <unk> are <unk> in red .
You see , you <unk> it up to the blue <unk> .
That 's the ice in <unk> , which <unk> in summer .
You can see that the <unk> ice <unk> , five years or more , is like the blood , which here <unk> from the body .
<unk> years old , over the time , so .
This is a problem because the <unk> <unk> <unk> around the ocean <unk> where there are huge <unk> of <unk> that , <unk> , are <unk> in <unk> by <unk> .
<unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> , that <unk> <unk> could <unk> , <unk> this point of not <unk> .
In some <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> is already <unk> by the water .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> ! <unk> : She 's good . <unk> : She 's good . The question is if we <unk> it .
A reason is that this <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
This is a <unk> river <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> had never <unk> <unk> .
This is the <unk> river in the <unk> of <unk> .
If you want to know how the <unk> of the sea <unk> to the <unk> of <unk> on <unk> , here is where the sea .
These <unk> are <unk> <unk> .
<unk> other hand on the planet : <unk> , the greatest <unk> of ice on the planet .
<unk> month , the <unk> of the ice <unk> is in <unk> , and that <unk> <unk> <unk> , which <unk> on some <unk> <unk> , is particularly <unk> in <unk> .
<unk> <unk> feet of the <unk> , like in <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> of ice , <unk> new <unk> , and a few years ago were <unk> .
<unk> percent of the world population <unk> <unk> <unk> by that <unk> .
<unk> <unk> : this <unk> is the <unk> of <unk> water of this city .
<unk> is <unk> .
But when you <unk> , the same happens to the water .
In California , <unk> , <unk> <unk> percent of the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> are in the crisis .
<unk> , as you read , they 're <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> in the world leads to a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> are <unk> to a <unk> out of the normal and <unk> .
<unk> times over the last 30 years than <unk> <unk> <unk> .
This is a <unk> of all <unk> .
If you look at it in the <unk> context , if you can see the <unk> .
In the last five years , we 've <unk> 70 million <unk> of CO2 every 24 hours of <unk> in the ocean every day .
Look at the area of the <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and both of the parts of the <unk> <unk> , where there is a <unk> <unk> of oxygen in the ocean .
The <unk> <unk> of global warming , <unk> , <unk> , which is 20 percent of them , is the use of <unk> <unk> .
The oil is a problem , and <unk> is even worse .
The United States is one of the most countries with <unk> emissions , together to China .
And they 're <unk> to build a lot of other <unk> <unk> .
But we 're <unk> to a <unk> of <unk> .
These are the <unk> projects over the last few years and some <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> , there is a <unk> politics in our country .
<unk> <unk> and <unk> have <unk> million dollars in the last year to <unk> <unk> <unk> , which is a <unk> .
I 'm going to <unk> something --
<unk> <unk> <unk> , in <unk> , where I live , there was a <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
<unk> you saw it on <unk> .
This is the <unk> bigger <unk> of <unk> in America .
It 's happened around <unk> .
<unk> <unk> of one of the <unk> of one of the <unk> of <unk> was this .
<unk> : <unk> ♫ ♫ <unk> <unk> is a <unk> and happy .
It 's <unk> here in America , and it <unk> our economy .
<unk> the <unk> is more <unk> .
It 's <unk> , <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> it .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The greatest <unk> society on the <unk> is <unk> <unk> . This is his <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> <unk> -- <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> -- they don 't know what they 're talking about .
<unk> : So the <unk> for the <unk> of <unk> has <unk> two <unk> .
This is one of them , a part of them .
<unk> : <unk> : <unk> <unk> we see the <unk> of <unk> as a <unk> <unk> <unk> to our business .
So , our <unk> is <unk> a big amount of money in a <unk> <unk> to make public and <unk> the truth of <unk> .
In fact , <unk> is not <unk> .
We think it 's <unk> -- it 's also a good <unk> .
So we don 't <unk> about climate change .
We 're going to do it .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> <unk> -- you 've heard about it very much .
So , I 'm going to <unk> a <unk> structure for how about <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> ! The machines are a little bit <unk> , but this is the sound of the <unk> of the <unk> technology .
<unk> <unk> <unk> is between the major <unk> of global warming , but <unk> technology <unk> <unk> that you can see all .
<unk> a look at this , this is the <unk> <unk> technology .
<unk> : <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to the economic <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> , America is in the crisis ; the national security crisis , the <unk> crisis .
The <unk> that <unk> all of them , our <unk> <unk> <unk> , like <unk> and oil <unk> .
Now , there 's a new <unk> , <unk> solution for <unk> .
<unk> America : 100 percent of <unk> energy , in 10 years .
A plan for <unk> America at work , more <unk> , and help <unk> <unk> global warming .
<unk> , a solution that we <unk> to solve our problems .
<unk> America . <unk> more .
<unk> : This is the last one .
<unk> : <unk> : It 's <unk> energy to America .
One of the most <unk> ways of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> our planet .

<unk> <unk> : A old <unk> <unk> says , " If you want to go <unk> , you go out to alone .
If you want to go away , you go together . "
We have to go away , quickly .
Thank you very much .
<unk> year at TED I <unk> a <unk> on <unk> .
And I 'm going to try to <unk> it on how the machine works .
So here we go . And for those that the other time there were no , the <unk> is the largest scientific experiment ever <unk> -- <unk> miles of <unk> .
His task is to <unk> the conditions that were in the <unk> of a second <unk> of the universe -- until the beginning of the universe -- to <unk> million times at the second .
That 's just <unk> .
This is the machine under <unk> .
<unk> these <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> .
This is what I work . It 's called <unk> -- it 's <unk> <unk> feet and it has a <unk> <unk> .
This is a <unk> picture of <unk> in building so you can see the <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> of last year we <unk> the car for the first time .
And this picture was <unk> by <unk> .
It was <unk> <unk> <unk> in the control .
It 's an image of the first <unk> of particles that had all the <unk> <unk> , <unk> , with a <unk> of the <unk> , and <unk> <unk> , with a part of the <unk> , and <unk> particles inside the <unk> .
In other words , when I <unk> that picture the 10 <unk> , I 'll <unk> that the <unk> machine , which is a great <unk> .
I don 't know if it was this <unk> <unk> to us more or this , when somebody <unk> on Google and <unk> that the page was this .
That means we had a <unk> impact beyond that scientific impact .
<unk> a week after , there was a problem with the car , we had to just <unk> these <unk> here -- these <unk> <unk> .
These <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> when the car works at the <unk> of <unk> .
Now , the <unk> between you to <unk> the <unk> and <unk> , " It 's not true . I 'm too <unk> . "
And instead they can do it because when they 're very <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
So , at least <unk> degrees at a <unk> temperature at that of the space between stars , these <unk> can bring that <unk> .
In one of the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> in the <unk> , there was a <unk> of <unk> .
So the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
This was the result .
Now , this is more <unk> <unk> if you think these <unk> <unk> <unk> more than 20 <unk> , and that <unk> of about 30 <unk> .
They 're <unk> about 50 <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , what we did .
We <unk> them and <unk> .
Now they 're all <unk> to their <unk> place .
<unk> the end of <unk> <unk> <unk> will be again again .
We <unk> it , and we <unk> to get <unk> data to <unk> or <unk> , and so our <unk> to discover what the <unk> are the <unk> that are <unk> that <unk> the universe .
Now , of course , in a certain way , these <unk> <unk> <unk> on the <unk> of science and engineering engineering engineering of <unk> . It 's easy to <unk> .
I think that the fact that is so hard , the fact of <unk> to go beyond <unk> , I think that is the value of things like <unk> .
I want to end with the words of a <unk> <unk> <unk> , which , <unk> , <unk> , which , <unk> , and his <unk> was Michael <unk> , his <unk> was Michael <unk> , " <unk> is <unk> <unk> for the progress of the human mind that <unk> ideas of science is <unk> , that there are not <unk> in nature , that we don 't have to <unk> in nature ,
Thank you .
I want to start <unk> to <unk> <unk> when when when , children , <unk> <unk> .
<unk> like <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> to think and <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> is <unk> <unk> to the way we <unk> <unk> in the world around us .
So , from <unk> <unk> <unk> of our <unk> with <unk> objects , and my <unk> <unk> <unk> , and my <unk> <unk> <unk> , I started to <unk> : " And if we use a computer , instead of having the <unk> <unk> <unk> as a computer <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a information with a <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
and we started our <unk> ?
The question was so interesting that we could explore the answer , building <unk> .
In a few words , a <unk> is a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
In a few words , a <unk> is a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
You can <unk> them with your hand , they can <unk> them , and they have a screen and they have a screen and a <unk> <unk> .
But <unk> , they 're <unk> objects , like <unk> , you can just <unk> <unk> .
<unk> are the example of a new <unk> of tools to <unk> information to <unk> the digital information .
And as they get more <unk> , <unk> of the movement , <unk> of the other , and as they get more <unk> , <unk> of the other <unk> , <unk> of the other , as <unk> , we can explore and <unk> <unk> .
I 'm going to <unk> with some simple example .
This <unk> is <unk> to show <unk> : if you <unk> it in one direction , the video <unk> , if you <unk> it in one direction , the <unk> <unk> , if you <unk> on the other <unk> back .
These <unk> <unk> are <unk> <unk> of others .
If you <unk> them , you get them to what they 're around .
If they come up , you can <unk> it and they can <unk> it a little bit .
If they come up , you can <unk> it and they can <unk> it a little bit .
They also <unk> their movement and <unk> .
And then we realized that one of the interesting <unk> of <unk> was the <unk> that we could use <unk> on the data , to <unk> <unk> , " a color as if it was a <unk> .
In this case , we have three <unk> <unk> <unk> as a <unk> of <unk> and I can <unk> it for <unk> of color in the central , where you get <unk> .
and I can <unk> it to <unk> of the <unk> in the central , where you get .
And if you get too much , we can <unk> a little bit about it .
I 'm also <unk> <unk> <unk> , like <unk> , mathematics and games of <unk> where people can <unk> things things quickly , and <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Now I 'm --
This is a <unk> sequence that I do with a <unk> program .
Here we have a game of words that is half between <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> , at every <unk> <unk> a letter to case on every <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> every <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> on a <unk> .
Then , after about 30 seconds , you <unk> , and you have a new <unk> of <unk> and new possibilities to try .
Thank you .
Here 's the children <unk> in <unk> <unk> <unk> , I did so that I <unk> them and I <unk> a video .
They 're very <unk> .
And one of the interesting things of this <unk> <unk> is that you don 't have to give people a lot of <unk> .
I just just say , " <unk> of the words , " and they know exactly what to do .
Here 's other people who <unk> it .
This is our <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , there on the right .
It was just <unk> .
They were just <unk> , for him .
Now , this is a <unk> of a <unk> <unk> .
<unk> to build a <unk> for the <unk> of the <unk> . He 's <unk> .
It can <unk> new characters in the scene , <unk> their <unk> .
It can <unk> new characters in the scene , <unk> their <unk> .
Here 's , it 's doing the sun .
<unk> : The sun is <unk> .
David <unk> : Now , he took a <unk> in the scene .
<unk> : The <unk> <unk> .
<unk> work ! Yeah !
So , <unk> <unk> and <unk> can make the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> !
... <unk> your story .
<unk> : <unk> !
<unk> : It 's a <unk> story , and it can decide him as you <unk> .
<unk> : It 's a <unk> story , and it can decide him as you <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> away , <unk> .
<unk> : The last example I have time to show you is a <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , to <unk> and <unk> music .
It 's a <unk> , <unk> <unk> and <unk> music .
The <unk> here <unk> <unk> as the <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> of these have four different <unk> , and you can choose what to use .
You can also <unk> these <unk> in a sequence of your <unk> .
And I just <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> . "
These are effects that you can control out of the live , like <unk> and <unk> .
I <unk> it to a particular sound and then <unk> to <unk> it .
And then there are the effects of time and <unk> , which <unk> to <unk> the entire sequence .
<unk> like it works .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> in a series of <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
Now , I 'm going to be a <unk> line .
<unk> : <unk> : Now , I 'm going to <unk> <unk> --
<unk> : <unk> : And now I 'm going to <unk> the <unk> to the <unk> , so I can control the effect of the <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> : I can <unk> the entire <unk> <unk> time on one side or the other .
<unk> : <unk> : And now we 're going to <unk> the <unk> to give more <unk> .
<unk> : I can <unk> the <unk> <unk> .
So I don 't have to <unk> <unk> before , but I can <unk> it , <unk> <unk> or more <unk> .
And now , finally , I can <unk> the entire <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is to build new <unk> <unk> <unk> more <unk> to how our brain work our brain and body .
And today , I had time to show one of the results of this <unk> , and also some <unk> that we 're trying to get out of the lab .
The concept I want to <unk> is that new generation of <unk> objects to <unk> with the <unk> <unk> , that we want to <unk> information in our world in the way we want .
Thank you very much .
I don 't see the time to talk to all of you .
I 'm a <unk> .
<unk> books is my <unk> but it 's more than this , of course .
It 's also love and <unk> of my life .
And I don 't look like to me that can change .
But , I said this , something particular happened in my life and my career , who <unk> me to <unk> the whole <unk> of this work .
The particular thing is I wrote this book , this <unk> called <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> <unk> , and <unk> a big <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And the result is everywhere <unk> <unk> , people me <unk> me as if I was <unk> .
<unk> -- <unk> , <unk> , <unk> !
I 'm going to <unk> me , and they say , " You don 't be afraid of them to me , " You don 't know , I 'm going to be able to do better ?
You don 't know , you don 't know , you can 't be able to be able to create a book that can <unk> to somebody ? "
that can <unk> to somebody ? "
It 's <unk> , you know .
But it could go worse , and I remember that more than 20 years ago , when I was <unk> to people -- I was a <unk> -- I wanted to be a <unk> .
I 'm going to be <unk> <unk> from fear .
And people said , " Don 't you know that I couldn 't have success ?
Do you not <unk> that <unk> <unk> you ?
You don 't fear to do this <unk> for all life without any any <unk> , you 've been out and die on a <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> ? "
So , you know .
The answer -- the short answer to all these questions is , " Yeah . "
Yeah , I fear of all of these things .
I 've always had fear .
And I 'm also afraid of many other things that people couldn 't <unk> it .
As <unk> and other <unk> things .
But , as much about it write about what I thought and <unk> <unk> is why ?
Is it <unk> ?
It 's <unk> that anyone who <unk> <unk> to be <unk> by a job that you feel born to do .
But what is so particular , in the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> about health <unk> <unk> <unk> in a way that other <unk> don 't do ?
How did my father , for example , he was a <unk> <unk> and not remember one time in his 40 years of activity where the asked asked the <unk> if she was asked if you fear to be <unk> <unk> ?
<unk> 't it -- that <unk> of the <unk> of John , how do it ?
<unk> 't you know , <unk> ?
<unk> , <unk> engineers like <unk> <unk> , they don 't have <unk> , in <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
We <unk> , we have a <unk> this <unk> , and not just <unk> , but <unk> of all these <unk> of being <unk> <unk> .
And we don 't want to look at the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> that , just in the <unk> century , <unk> young and often for them .
And the <unk> that don 't seem to be really <unk> by their <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> , before die , he died , " <unk> my book , " <unk> me a little bit more <unk> <unk> <unk> about the work of their life .
But we didn 't know when we were saying that , because we 've heard these things so long that in some way we have <unk> <unk> and <unk> the <unk> that creativity and <unk> are in some <unk> <unk> and <unk> the art , finally , <unk> always <unk> .
And the question I want to <unk> to all here is , you have <unk> with this idea of that ?
So , I 'll be <unk> by a <unk> <unk> <unk> to me , it 's not good for anything .
I think it 's <unk> .
And I think it 's also <unk> and I don 't want to <unk> it in the next century .
I think it 's better <unk> our big <unk> <unk> to live .
And I certainly know , in my case -- it would be very <unk> to start <unk> to <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in which I 'm in my career .
<unk> -- look at it , I 'm pretty young , I 've got about 40 years old .
I still about four <unk> of work in me .
And it 's very <unk> that anything <unk> now in the world , and then it 's going to be <unk> by the world as the work after the <unk> of my last book .
<unk> <unk> , because we 're all <unk> <unk> , because we 're all <unk> that my greatest success is to my greatest success .
Oh , <unk> , <unk> , who thought !
You know this is the kind of thought that leads a person to start <unk> <unk> on the morning , and I don 't want to do it .
I 'm going to continue to do this work that I love .
So , the question is , how does it look like ?
And so I think , after many <unk> <unk> , which the way to work to continue to <unk> is what to create a <unk> <unk> <unk> , OK ?
I have to get a <unk> <unk> between me , which I 'm <unk> , and my natural <unk> on which is written <unk> to <unk> . And as I would be <unk> for all last year , how to do we <unk> to look through the time , looking for the other society to see if we have better ideas and more <unk> ideas .
about how to help people <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of creativity .
And that research led me to <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
<unk> because I went back and then <unk> back .
<unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> -- people don 't believe that <unk> creativity creativity <unk> from men , OK ?
And it <unk> that creativity was this <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> to men from a few <unk> <unk> and <unk> , for reasons and <unk> , for <unk> and <unk> , for reasons and <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> of creativity " <unk> . "
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> to have a <unk> that <unk> <unk> from away .
The <unk> were the same idea , but <unk> that species of spirit of the <unk> without a <unk> .
The <unk> is <unk> , because <unk> <unk> didn 't really <unk> that a <unk> was somebody particularly smart .
I thought a <unk> was this <unk> <unk> species that <unk> <unk> <unk> , literally in the <unk> of a artist , a little bit like <unk> <unk> <unk> , and that <unk> out of <unk> <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> of the artist and <unk> the result of that work .
<unk> <unk> <unk> , that 's the distance of which I 'm talking about -- that <unk> <unk> <unk> you from the results of your work .
And everybody <unk> that was so <unk> , right ?
So the artists were <unk> by <unk> things , like the too <unk> , like the too <unk> , right ?
If your work was <unk> not <unk> all the <unk> , you know , all of <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> from this <unk> <unk> .
If your work <unk> , it wasn 't all <unk> your <unk> , right ?
<unk> that was your <unk> to be a <unk> .
And so people <unk> <unk> creativity in <unk> for a long time .
Then the <unk> <unk> and all <unk> , and <unk> this big idea ; we put the human <unk> on the center of the universe , all the <unk> and <unk> and <unk> without <unk> space to <unk> <unk> .
This was the principle of <unk> <unk> and people started thinking about <unk> creativity <unk> of <unk> .
And for the first time in the history , they <unk> to this or that artist as a <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> to a person with <unk> .
And I think I was a big <unk> .
I think I would <unk> to somebody , a simple person to believe that it 's like a <unk> , <unk> and <unk> of all the <unk> <unk> , <unk> and <unk> <unk> of all the <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> and <unk> is a <unk> <unk> <unk> to <unk> human <unk> .
It 's like to ask somebody to <unk> the sun .
<unk> and <unk> completely <unk> <unk> and all these <unk> <unk> <unk> on the <unk> .
And I think it was this pressure to have <unk> <unk> the artists in the <unk> 500 years .
And if this is true , and I think that is , the question is , the question is , and now ?
Can we do it ?
I 'm going to go back to a more <unk> understanding of human relationship between humans and <unk> <unk> .
Or maybe no .
<unk> we can 't <unk> 500 years of <unk> in a <unk> talk about 18 minutes .
And there is probably people in the audience who <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> on the <unk> of <unk> , you do that <unk> people <unk> <unk> <unk> on their projects .
You probably don 't <unk> all about this .
But the question I 'd like to <unk> is -- why ?
Why don 't we do it in this way ?
Because it has more sense of any other thing that has ever heard about <unk> <unk> <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> .
A process that , as anyone who has ever <unk> to do something -- so , basically , everybody -- know , you don 't know , you don 't get <unk> <unk> .
And in fact , it can be completely <unk> .
I 've done this <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , who has now 90 years , but that was a <unk> for all of life and said that during his <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> out of his <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> out in the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
He said it was like a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And that I 'm going to <unk> it up to her <unk> .
And he <unk> it , because he was <unk> the land under his feet .
I decided to have one thing to do that point and was , and he was , his <unk> , " <unk> as a <unk> . "
And so we went to the house and it was <unk> by this <unk> , and it wouldn 't have to get a piece of paper and a <unk> <unk> enough <unk> , as the <unk> , <unk> and <unk> on the page .
<unk> times not <unk> to be enough fast , so <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> <unk> and her <unk> and she would <unk> it up and she would <unk> it up with <unk> , and she would <unk> it up to <unk> through the <unk> , looking for , as she said , " another <unk> . "
Then there were those times -- this piece of never <unk> it -- there was no <unk> where the <unk> was almost <unk> , right ?
So , he was <unk> home and <unk> was looking for paper and the <unk> <unk> through , and then he was <unk> <unk> in the <unk> , and then he said , he was like <unk> with the other hand and <unk> .
<unk> the <unk> of the tail and the <unk> in his body and the <unk> on the page .
And in these cases , the <unk> would be <unk> on the <unk> page and <unk> but <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , but the <unk> word .
So when I <unk> it -- it 's <unk> , it 's exactly <unk> to my <unk> process .
Not all my <unk> process -- I 'm not a <unk> .
I 'm a <unk> , and my way of <unk> is ; it <unk> at the same <unk> every day and working and work and <unk> on the <unk> .
But even I , in my <unk> , I <unk> against that , <unk> , sometimes .
And I think a lot of you <unk> it .
You know , even if the work and the ideas <unk> me <unk> from a certain source , I couldn 't <unk> it .
And what is this ?
And how can we <unk> it in a way we don 't lose your head , but , rather , what would you have to <unk> <unk> ?
So , as I think about , the best example I have is the <unk> <unk> <unk> , which I 've been <unk> different years ago for a <unk> .
<unk> of this , and you know , <unk> , for the <unk> of life was the <unk> of the <unk> artist <unk> <unk> , trying to control <unk> , <unk> these <unk> <unk> <unk> .
But then <unk> , he was <unk> , and one day while she was <unk> on a <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> all for him .
<unk> <unk> , and all of a <unk> <unk> this little <unk> of <unk> , who comes into his head as <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , and you know , and you want , you know , it 's wonderful , and <unk> , but not how to <unk> .
It has no <unk> of paper , it doesn 't have a <unk> , it has no <unk> .
So he starts to hear this <unk> <unk> species , " I 'm going to lose in him , and <unk> <unk> <unk> by this song .
I 'm not <unk> enough , and I can 't <unk> it . "
And instead of going to go into the <unk> , they <unk> .
<unk> the whole process <unk> and did something completely new .
He just just <unk> the sky and said , " <unk> , you don 't see that I 'm <unk> ? "
" Do you think it can write a song now ?
If you really want to <unk> , you 're going to be <unk> when I can <unk> care of you .
<unk> , <unk> to <unk> <unk> more <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . "
And his <unk> <unk> <unk> after this .
Not the work , the work was still <unk> as always .
But the process , and the <unk> <unk> that <unk> was <unk> when <unk> the <unk> , the <unk> that <unk> out of him , the <unk> that <unk> out of where , <unk> <unk> , <unk> that didn 't have to be a <unk> thing and <unk> .
but <unk> this <unk> , wonderful <unk> <unk> a conversation between <unk> and this <unk> thing and <unk> , but it was not <unk> .
So , how much the story <unk> to change a little bit of the way I <unk> and already <unk> me once .
This idea , I was <unk> when I was <unk> " <unk> , " and I was <unk> , " and I <unk> in one of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> where we 're working on something and you can think that a <unk> , that 's going to be the <unk> book .
Not just <unk> , right , right right , right now , <unk> book .
And I started thinking about <unk> this project .
But then I <unk> <unk> that <unk> to the air and <unk> us .
So I <unk> my face on the <unk> and <unk> my <unk> to a <unk> <unk> <unk> of the room .
And I said to <unk> <unk> , " <unk> , " What , " is , " both , " <unk> , " no ?
Because as you see I 'm going to <unk> all that I have , no more than this .
So if you want it to be better , you have to <unk> and do your <unk> .
OK . But if you don 't do it , you know , I don 't know , I 'm going to do anything .
I started to write the same because it 's my work .
And I 'd like to be <unk> that I 'm <unk> to do my <unk> to do my <unk> . " Because it 's so , <unk> -- <unk> does in the <unk> of Africa , people <unk> to <unk> <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> of the moon , <unk> music , <unk> and hours to <unk> .
And they were always <unk> , because the <unk> were <unk> and <unk> .
But every long , <unk> , something <unk> , and one of these <unk> artists actually actually <unk> .
And I know you know , I 'm going to talk , because I know you 've all seen it , at a certain point , a <unk> .
It was like the time , and the <unk> <unk> <unk> through a kind of <unk> and he was not doing anything different from <unk> , like <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> before , but everything <unk> .
And suddenly , it 's not just like a human .
But it <unk> out of <unk> and <unk> in the <unk> of <unk> .
And when this <unk> , at the time , people <unk> what was , and he <unk> it with his name .
<unk> hands and <unk> <unk> , " <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , God , God , " God , " God , " God , " God , " God . "
That 's God , you know .
<unk> <unk> -- when the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> this <unk> with them and <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , " <unk> , " which you can hear in <unk> or <unk> .
In <unk> , when an artist did something impossible and <unk> , " <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> -- a <unk> of God .
And it 's <unk> because we need .
But the problem comes the day after , for the <unk> , <unk> , when you <unk> and <unk> that are 11 of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> God doesn 't have more .
It 's just a <unk> with a big <unk> to <unk> , and maybe never <unk> to <unk> that <unk> .
And maybe no one <unk> the name of God still <unk> , and what 's going to do with the rest of his life ?
It 's hard .
This is one of the most <unk> <unk> to do in a <unk> life .
But maybe it doesn 't have to be so <unk> if you don 't believe , <unk> , <unk> , that the <unk> <unk> of your being from you .
But I just <unk> that you have <unk> <unk> from a <unk> source of this <unk> part of this <unk> part of your life , then you have to <unk> <unk> .
And , you know , if we think about this way , it changes .
And so I started <unk> , and it 's certainly like I 've been <unk> for several months during the <unk> of the book that will soon soon be , <unk> , <unk> <unk> of my success .
And what I have to continue <unk> when I feel <unk> from this is , not <unk> .
I 'm not just <unk> your work .
<unk> to <unk> for your side , any <unk> can be .
If your work is <unk> , <unk> .
If the <unk> , you 're <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> some kind of <unk> , for one moment through your <unk> , then , " <unk> ! "
You know , you do the same your <unk> .
And " <unk> ! " <unk> ! " <unk> you do it .
I think I think it 's <unk> <unk> .
" <unk> ! " <unk> ! " <unk> , " <unk> love love love and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Thank you .
Thank you .
<unk> <unk> : <unk> !
As you know , I 've been talking about some of these projects about human genome , what can <unk> and <unk> of new genes .
Now we 're <unk> a new <unk> , we started to <unk> biology and now starting to <unk> biology and now starting to <unk> a new <unk> of biology , <unk> and <unk> life .
We 've always been trying to <unk> big questions .
" <unk> is life ? " It 's something that many <unk> <unk> I think they have <unk> to understand to various levels .
We tried a lot of <unk> , <unk> to <unk> <unk> .
We 're <unk> for about 20 years now .
When we <unk> the human genome <unk> <unk> to <unk> from the world of biology in the digital world of the computer .
Now we <unk> : we can <unk> life , or create new life from this digital universe ?
This is the map of a little <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , which is the species from the <unk> genome of those that can <unk> in the lab .
And we tried to reduce the genome to <unk> one more little <unk> .
We can <unk> a <unk> of <unk> about 500 genes that are here .
But when we take a look at his <unk> map , it 's <unk> simple than our .
<unk> , this is simple .
But when we look at all the genes that we can <unk> , one at the time , it 's very <unk> that this can bring a <unk> cell .
So I thought the only <unk> <unk> was <unk> this <unk> <unk> <unk> for some of these questions .
And so we started the <unk> of the <unk> of the " We can <unk> a <unk> ? "
Can the chemistry <unk> to produce these big molecules that we 've never been able to create before ?
And in case , <unk> , we can make a <unk> <unk> ?
A <unk> is just a piece of <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The speed we 're able to <unk> life is <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> .
Our ability to write the <unk> <unk> , instead , <unk> <unk> , but it 's <unk> .
And our <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
We 've <unk> over 15 years ago .
The process has <unk> a lot of <unk> , <unk> with a <unk> <unk> <unk> before we <unk> the experiments .
But we found that <unk> of DNA is very difficult .
There are <unk> of thousands of machines in the world that <unk> little DNA <unk> , of 30 to 50 <unk> <unk> and it 's a <unk> process : the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> is <unk> , more <unk> .
So we had to develop a new <unk> to <unk> these <unk> and <unk> the <unk> .
And this was our first <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
It 's a little virus that bacteria <unk> .
We designed <unk> , <unk> the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> a <unk> of <unk> DNA <unk> <unk> .
The interesting part of that is when we took this piece of <unk> <unk> <unk> and we <unk> it in the bacteria , the bacteria have <unk> to read this <unk> code .
<unk> particles have been <unk> by cells , they 're <unk> by cells , and they <unk> <unk> <unk> .
I 've been talking about recently with members of the <unk> industry that they have <unk> this model .
They have more than you .
And I think this is a situation where the software can actually actually build his own <unk> in a <unk> system .
But let 's go to the greatest things in big .
We could build the entire <unk> of <unk> .
I 'm more <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
So we thought of <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of a virus , so that we can change the <unk> of a <unk> cell .
<unk> is <unk> , and if we <unk> information to <unk> in a computer , these have to be very <unk> .
When we <unk> this genome for the first time in <unk> <unk> , the standard <unk> was of a <unk> for every 10 <unk> <unk> .
We found , <unk> , 30 <unk> . If we were <unk> that original <unk> <unk> <unk> never been able to do it .
One of the process is to design <unk> 50 <unk> that <unk> with all the other <unk> of 50 <unk> to build smaller <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
I 'm going to be <unk> here .
You probably read that <unk> us <unk> .
So , we have a <unk> <unk> on four <unk> : <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> and <unk>
<unk> of those <unk> <unk> <unk> together about 20 <unk> <unk> , and there 's a <unk> order to <unk> for every <unk> .
So we can use the <unk> code to write words , <unk> , <unk> .
What we did at the beginning was <unk> .
Some of them were <unk> by the fact that it wasn 't <unk> .
We designed these <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> .
There are <unk> that <unk> them and <unk> them .
And we started <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
But at every step , we 've <unk> these <unk> in <unk> so that we 're <unk> to create a very <unk> <unk> <unk> , as you 'll see in a minute .
We 're trying to <unk> the process .
So this seems to the <unk> of a <unk> of <unk> .
When we started to these <unk> <unk> <unk> , more than 100 <unk> <unk> <unk> , not <unk> <unk> directly in the <unk> <unk> .
You get to the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> of biology .
So we 've <unk> others .
<unk> of another <unk> called <unk> <unk> , which in biology <unk> to <unk> the DNA that can <unk> the <unk> .
Here 's an example .
This <unk> , called <unk> <unk> , can <unk> three million <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
You can see in the <unk> <unk> as his <unk> is <unk> .
<unk> hours -- 24 hours it 's <unk> exactly like it was before .
<unk> thousands of organisms that are able to do it .
These organisms can be completely <unk> .
We 're going to live under <unk> .
I 'm absolutely sure that life <unk> in space , and they <unk> to find new <unk> of water <unk> .
And at the real , NASA showed that this is .
This is a picture of the <unk> that we 've built these <unk> , just using the <unk> with the <unk> design of <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> them <unk> .
This picture was not <unk> with a <unk> <unk> , but with a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
It 's a <unk> so big that we can <unk> with a <unk> <unk> .
These are pictures that <unk> a time of about six seconds .
This is the <unk> that we 've done a little bit of time ago .
I 'm more <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
It 's the greatest <unk> of a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
It has a <unk> <unk> <unk> million .
If you <unk> it with a <unk> 10 <unk> , we <unk> pages to <unk> this <unk> <unk> .
Now , how do we work ? How can we <unk> it ?
Of course , through a virus is a <unk> of kids .
It 's a little bit more <unk> when you 're using <unk> .
It 's <unk> <unk> cells as our : you can just <unk> the <unk> and <unk> another , which is basically the <unk> of <unk> .
In <unk> , we <unk> the <unk> is <unk> inside the cell , but we have <unk> <unk> that we 're able to do a <unk> <unk> of a <unk> from one cell to another and <unk> .
We <unk> a <unk> <unk> from a <unk> species .
<unk> are different as the men from <unk> .
We <unk> some <unk> <unk> in a more <unk> way to decide what to do for this <unk> .
And then he <unk> it with <unk> <unk> all the <unk> .
And when we put it in the cell was <unk> and <unk> our <unk> <unk> the new <unk> <unk> went into the cell .
And <unk> <unk> that we didn 't go beyond , but we tried to <unk> more in there .
This is one of the major <unk> of evolution .
We found that <unk> species have <unk> a second or a third <unk> <unk> from some of a few <unk> , <unk> in a second thousands of new <unk> <unk> to the species .
So who think about evolution as a <unk> just <unk> at the time you <unk> didn 't understand a lot of biology .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> that was in the cell didn 't <unk> one .
<unk> <unk> that we have <unk> it .
It 's <unk> , and he <unk> the other <unk> as <unk> material , and we <unk> it with just <unk> , and we <unk> it with just the cell and the new <unk> .
It became blue because of the genes that we <unk> .
And in a short <unk> of time , all of the <unk> of a species are <unk> <unk> , and it <unk> <unk> of all over a new species , <unk> on the new software that we <unk> in the cell .
All the <unk> are <unk> , the <unk> are <unk> , and when you <unk> the <unk> code , exactly what we have <unk> .
Now , this could be <unk> <unk> , but <unk> the software we can change things in a <unk> <unk> .
Now , I 've already <unk> that here is not talking about <unk> -- but of progress to <unk> million years and a half of evolution , and I already said that maybe we 're going to create a new <unk> version of the <unk> <unk> that we <unk> <unk> new <unk> <unk> in this process .
Why do that ?
I think it 's pretty <unk> when we think about our <unk> .
We 're going to go from six billion and a half a <unk> billion people in the next 40 years .
Right to give one example : I was born in <unk> .
Now there are three people on the planet to <unk> <unk> in <unk> ; in 40 years , there will be four .
We 're <unk> problems now to find food , <unk> and <unk> and <unk> for six billion people .
We 're still <unk> to do it for nine billion .
<unk> more than five billion <unk> , more than 30 billion <unk> <unk> <unk> .
That means percent million <unk> a day .
When we try to find <unk> <unk> <unk> , or any kind of process to <unk> , it will be a huge challenge .
We have to <unk> all of the <unk> of CO2 <unk> from these materials that <unk> in the atmosphere .
At day , because of the <unk> <unk> in the world , we have a <unk> with about 20 million genes , and I like to think that are the <unk> <unk> for the future .
<unk> industry just <unk> a <unk> about <unk> , and think about how many different things are <unk> out .
Our <unk> here are data from <unk> <unk> and our imagination .
Now we have <unk> , because of these <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> , able to create what we call <unk> <unk> .
We can build a big robot that can make a million <unk> a day .
Think of <unk> these 20 million genes or <unk> to <unk> <unk> to produce <unk> or <unk> , new <unk> , we can change , <unk> , <unk> , we can change , because of a little <unk> , and to create more biology now that in the last 20 years of science .
And it 's just a standard <unk> .
We can choose to <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
This is a <unk> of some software <unk> that we 're working on to be able to <unk> and design species to the computer .
Well , we don 't know how to be going to be .
We know exactly how their <unk> code .
Now we 're <unk> on the <unk> of <unk> generation .
You also saw that you can <unk> <unk> from <unk> was a <unk> experiment .
We have <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> or different <unk> .
But the only way that biology can have a big impact without <unk> <unk> the cost of food and <unk> would be <unk> the CO2 in matter before , where we 're working on to <unk> cells that we 're working on to design cells that can achieve this purpose , and we think we can have the first <unk> of <unk> <unk> in about 18 months .
<unk> <unk> <unk> with CO2 is a <unk> , but in our <unk> <unk> around the world , we found different <unk> .
This is a <unk> that we have <unk> in <unk> .
<unk> in the ocean , at about <unk> feet of <unk> <unk> of <unk> water .
<unk> <unk> <unk> by CO2 using <unk> <unk> as hydrogen <unk> .
We 're trying to understand whether we can <unk> CO2 , that can easily be <unk> through <unk> , <unk> that CO2 in <unk> , to drive this process .
So , we think we might be able to <unk> what the question of the basic question , " which is , " <unk> , we <unk> the <unk> goal of <unk> the whole <unk> industry .
<unk> . If you can 't do it from TED , where can ?
<unk> a <unk> of energy .
<unk> , we 're working for the same <unk> to create <unk> <unk> .
You 've seen this year with the flu , we 're always <unk> back of a year and with a dollar in less when it 's <unk> <unk> .
I think that you can change a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Here 's how the future could start to look at it , the tree of evolution , <unk> <unk> , <unk> evolution with bacteria <unk> , and finally <unk> cells .
We 're at so <unk> <unk> people .
Our purpose is to make a <unk> enough enough to <unk> to try to <unk> it . Thank you very much .
First of all , I 'm going to do , the <unk> possible , some of the new technology that we 've taken up to <unk> a <unk> almost a year ago . This is <unk> .
It 's a environment where you can <unk> is <unk> <unk> with a huge <unk> of data .
Here we 're seeing <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> with a kind of <unk> <unk> and <unk> , for a <unk> <unk> , <unk> the images as we want .
And it doesn 't matter how big the amount of information that we see , how big are these <unk> of data or the images .
Most of them are common pictures , but this is a <unk> <unk> <unk> from the <unk> of <unk> , and <unk> in the <unk> of 300 <unk> .
Not any difference because the only thing that <unk> the <unk> of a system like this is the number of <unk> on your screen at any moment . It 's also a lot of <unk> architecture .
This is a whole book , example of data not about images .
This is <unk> <unk> <unk> . Every <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And to <unk> that it 's just about <unk> and not <unk> of images , we can do something like that , to see that it 's a real <unk> <unk> of the text , not of a picture .
It could be a little bit <unk> to read a <unk> book .
I 'm not going to <unk> it .
This is an example more <unk> . It 's a number of <unk> <unk> .
Every picture is the beginning of a <unk> .
And it really gives you the <unk> and the beautiful experience of read the <unk> <unk> version of a <unk> or a <unk> , which is for nature a <unk> <unk> .
We also did something with the <unk> of this particular number of <unk> in particular <unk> .
We 've created a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and we <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
If you want to see the <unk> of this <unk> , you can see here .
Or other models , or even <unk> <unk> .
And this really <unk> some of these ideas to <unk> the <unk> of space on the screen .
I think this is going to put it to the <unk> and other <unk> <unk> <unk> , not <unk> to be <unk> .
Of course , the <unk> is one of the most <unk> <unk> for this kind of technology .
And on this , I don 't want to lose time , if not say we have <unk> <unk> to <unk> that we have <unk> to <unk> it also in this field .
These are all the <unk> in the United States , a <unk> picture of the NASA <unk> .
So now I started to something else .
This is actually actually live on the Web ; you can see it .
It 's a project called <unk> , which <unk> two different technologies .
One is <unk> and the other is a very interesting research computer computer computer <unk> <unk> , a <unk> student of Washington , with the help of <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> . A <unk> <unk> <unk> . A <unk> <unk> . <unk> . A <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And it 's alive on the web , <unk> <unk> .
You can <unk> when we do this kind of <unk> , where we can go from one picture to the other and have this kind of experience <unk> .
But the <unk> <unk> of the images here actually has a meaning .
And the <unk> of <unk> computers have <unk> these <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> where the <unk> <unk> all <unk> <unk> <unk> on the <unk> <unk> <unk> on the <unk> <unk> <unk> on the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . And so these things are all <unk> at <unk> level .
I don 't know if I have time to show you some other environment .
There are much more <unk> .
I want to go directly to one of the <unk> of <unk> data and this <unk> <unk> from a <unk> <unk> of <unk> that we 've done for the first time , to show you what we 've done is really the key behind this technology , the <unk> technology , and it 's not <unk> as <unk> as we have to put in in the website .
We had to <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> .
This is a <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> <unk> images of <unk> <unk> . And so on this model .
So I 'm all <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> all <unk> <unk> in this way .
And it 's possible to <unk> this <unk> way .
You know , I would never be thought to work for <unk> .
It 's very <unk> <unk> <unk> this kind of <unk> here .
I think you can see that it 's a lot of different kinds of <unk> <unk> : from those <unk> <unk> <unk> , a number of <unk> , <unk> <unk> , a <unk> number , <unk> together in this environment .
And if I can , I <unk> to look at those <unk> .
A lot of them <unk> , etc .
<unk> <unk> here is a series of photographs -- <unk> .
This is a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
We can go from <unk> to the physics of this environment .
The <unk> point is that we can do things with social environment . This is <unk> data from the whole memory of how to <unk> the land , from the <unk> of <unk> <unk> , and <unk> all of that data together .
All of those pictures become <unk> together , more than the <unk> parts .
You have a model of the entire land that <unk> .
Think of this as the <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> on Earth .
It 's something that <unk> in <unk> complexity as people <unk> , and the <unk> that we <unk> for who <unk> it with the use of <unk> .
Their pictures are <unk> <unk> with other people .
If somebody 's the idea of <unk> all these <unk> <unk> <unk> the name , my picture of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> all of these data , and I can use it as a <unk> <unk> <unk> to <unk> in that space , using the <unk> of anyone , and to have a social experience <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
Of course , a <unk> of all this is very <unk> <unk> of every interesting part of the earth , <unk> , not just <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> .
Chris Anderson : I realized that your software <unk> us to do is that at some point , in the next few years , all the pictures that are <unk> from anyone in the world will be <unk> <unk> together ?
<unk> : Yeah . What 's doing is actually <unk> .
It 's creating <unk> , if you want , between images .
And he 's <unk> it at the <unk> of the <unk> of the images .
And what becomes very interesting if you think about <unk> information information <unk> that many of these <unk> images .
As a <unk> of <unk> , you <unk> a <unk> and the <unk> on the page , you <unk> a <unk> and the <unk> on the page has a lot of information about images .
Now , what happens if that picture is <unk> to all your picture ?
So the amount of <unk> <unk> and the amount of <unk> that <unk> is really huge . It 's a <unk> effect of the network .
CA : <unk> , it 's really amazing .
<unk> : I 'm going to tell you a lot .
One of the major <unk> when you <unk> and one of the <unk> research is the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , who <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> to think that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , or that <unk> <unk> <unk> are still <unk> <unk> <unk> , or <unk> , or <unk> , or <unk> , <unk> <unk> , or <unk> , <unk> <unk> , to <unk> the <unk> of <unk> , and that the idea that we live in the world , but it 's just a reality , but it 's just a <unk> , it 's a <unk> , but it 's just a <unk> ,
the <unk> of a particular <unk> of <unk> choices that our <unk> <unk> did , good or bad , many <unk> .
And of course , all of the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Everybody <unk> . <unk> . <unk> .
We 're <unk> to <unk> <unk> .
We have to <unk> the <unk> of death , so we don 't <unk> it , if you <unk> and <unk> --
We all have a art .
What <unk> is the <unk> of the song , the <unk> of <unk> of every culture .
It doesn 't matter that <unk> <unk> <unk> , or <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> , or the <unk> of <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , the <unk> of <unk> , or a <unk> in the heart of <unk> .
He was my <unk> of the journey in the <unk> a month ago , or a <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> mother of the world .
All of these <unk> <unk> that there are other ways of <unk> other ways of thinking , other ways to move in the world .
And if you look at a moment , it 's a concept that can give you hope .
<unk> , <unk> <unk> of the world create a <unk> <unk> life and <unk> that <unk> the planet , and it 's important for the <unk> of the planet as <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And you can think of this <unk> <unk> as a <unk> and you can <unk> the <unk> of all the <unk> , <unk> of all the <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> in being from human imagination of <unk> .
<unk> is the <unk> of humanity .
It 's the <unk> of what we are and what we can be as as <unk> species .
And <unk> the <unk> was <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , for example , <unk> that 50 percent of all the species was or the <unk> of <unk> , just because it 's <unk> , or -- in the <unk> <unk> , or -- in the <unk> <unk> <unk> -- and you don 't even even even even <unk> <unk> -- that of the diversity .
<unk> of all that is , of course , <unk> <unk> .
When you 're <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> on this planet .
A <unk> language is not just <unk> by a <unk> or a series of <unk> rules .
A <unk> language is the <unk> of the human spirit .
It 's the middle that the <unk> of every culture comes in the world .
Every language is a forest of the mind , a <unk> , a thought , a <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
And of those <unk> <unk> <unk> , as we 're sitting here at <unk> , at least half the <unk> is no longer <unk> in the <unk> of the children .
They 're not going to <unk> to the children , the <unk> that means , at least that you don 't know something , who are already death .
What 's more <unk> than the <unk> of being <unk> by <unk> , the last to be the last to speak a language , of not <unk> the <unk> of <unk> or <unk> the <unk> of <unk> the <unk> of <unk> or <unk> the <unk> of <unk> ?
This <unk> <unk> was the state of somebody in the world every two weeks , every two weeks , every two weeks , a <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of a <unk> .
And I know somebody of you know , " Is it better ?
The world would not be a better place if we all have the same language ? " <unk> , then we 're all <unk> . <unk> .
<unk> <unk> .
<unk> of a <unk> , what means to say , you can 't talk about your language .
Today I 'd like to give you a journey through <unk> --
a little journey in the <unk> to give you a <unk> of what we 're <unk> .
Many of us <unk> that when I say , " different ways of <unk> <unk> , " I mean , I mean , I mean , a lot of us <unk> .
So , for example , this <unk> <unk> <unk> , the <unk> of <unk> , which <unk> <unk> to the <unk> of <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> <unk> .
It 's a <unk> that 's not able to <unk> the blue color of the green , because the <unk> time <unk> is <unk> in the time of the forest , which <unk> the <unk> .
They have a <unk> language and a <unk> rule , <unk> <unk> <unk> , you have to <unk> a person who talks about a different language .
And all of that has <unk> in the past <unk> , <unk> is that in these <unk> families where they talk six or seven <unk> because of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> no one language .
You <unk> to hear and then I started to talk about it .
<unk> one of the <unk> <unk> <unk> , an incredible <unk> that had the first <unk> of <unk> <unk> , an incredible <unk> that had the first <unk> in <unk> .
In <unk> , five <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
They 've been <unk> by the top of the <unk> of the <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> that this <unk> of the <unk> <unk> had never seen anything about <unk> .
They <unk> the picture of the land , they <unk> to <unk> a form or a <unk> and , not <unk> , they have <unk> <unk> <unk> , and they <unk> the five <unk> <unk> with <unk> .
But <unk> not just <unk> the <unk> .
They <unk> between them .
<unk> percent of the <unk> of the <unk> of their own .
We 're <unk> to eight <unk> and found two <unk> of death and when we <unk> to know , they <unk> that one of them was so that he died , and then they <unk> it .
The <unk> were able to recognize the animal from 40 <unk> and <unk> the species .
<unk> <unk> years old , I was <unk> a very interesting job when my <unk> <unk> <unk> me if my <unk> <unk> me if I wanted to go to <unk> <unk> between society in the <unk> <unk> of <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk>
To give a sense of <unk> , I should understand culture and that <unk> is not <unk> <unk> .
It 's pretty <unk> of a <unk> <unk> <unk> of the world .
Very interesting .
If you <unk> to <unk> the big <unk> of the world , what do you know ?
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , etc . .
A continent always <unk> out , thinking about <unk> Africa didn 't have <unk> <unk> <unk> . And instead and <unk> is not another that the <unk> of these <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
What makes the <unk> <unk> is the <unk> between life and death .
So <unk> are <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> can be <unk> by <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> in such a short moment , the <unk> becomes the <unk> .
So , for this <unk> <unk> to say , " <unk> <unk> <unk> go to <unk> to talk about God .
We <unk> in <unk> and <unk> God . "
And from the moment that you 're <unk> , is the spirit that <unk> you , how can you get it out of the <unk> ?
So , you <unk> to these incredible events : <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
I 've all the <unk> <unk> with the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , in the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> of <unk> civilization <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
In a <unk> continent of blood , this <unk> has never been <unk> by <unk> <unk> .
And I 'm <unk> today from a <unk> , but their <unk> is extraordinary <unk> .
<unk> <unk> come from <unk> to three or four years , and they live <unk> in a world <unk> and <unk> in a world <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> for 18 years .
Two <unk> of nine years <unk> of <unk> <unk> the nine months of <unk> that <unk> in the <unk> of mother , now are <unk> in the <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
So , for all this time , they get to the values of their society , values that <unk> their <unk> and just <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> -- or to say the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And then finally , at the <unk> of this incredible <unk> , and for the first time in their life , at the age of 18 , see a <unk> . And that moment of <unk> <unk> , when the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , everything they 've learned in theory is <unk> all the <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> . And he does a <unk> , and he <unk> <unk> , and says , and says ,
" <unk> ? I 'm going to tell you .
It 's <unk> . Now it 's <unk> . "
They 're called <unk> <unk> and they say , <unk> <unk> , we 're the <unk> of the <unk> of the world .
This level of <unk> is extremely important .
When we think about <unk> <unk> and the <unk> <unk> <unk> and the old story of the <unk> <unk> , which is a <unk> concept in his <unk> or maybe <unk> <unk> <unk> and say that these <unk> are more <unk> to the Earth .
<unk> <unk> are not <unk> or <unk> <unk> by <unk> .
There is no space for these things in the <unk> <unk> of <unk> or in the <unk> <unk> of <unk> , but because of time and <unk> , have created a <unk> of the Earth doesn 't <unk> the concept of <unk> <unk> <unk> , but on a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
What does this mean ?
You can say that a <unk> of <unk> that <unk> the mountain is a <unk> spirit that <unk> the <unk> is going to be a human being <unk> <unk> . And it 's going to be a <unk> of <unk> <unk> that <unk> a <unk> <unk> that <unk> a <unk> of <unk> that <unk> a <unk> <unk> that <unk> a mountain of <unk> <unk> to be <unk> .
That 's the <unk> of one spirit or a <unk> <unk> is <unk> .
What 's interesting is the <unk> that <unk> the relationship between the <unk> and the natural world .
I grew up in the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> to be <unk> .
And this has made me a different human being <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> that live in the <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> that live in the <unk> <unk> .
If we started to <unk> that these <unk> can actually create different , <unk> to start understand some of them <unk> . I 'll be <unk> this <unk> .
I <unk> this picture of <unk> in <unk> <unk> .
<unk> some of you 've heard about <unk> , the most powerful <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
What makes the <unk> is not the potential <unk> of <unk> , but his <unk> . It 's <unk> by two <unk> .
<unk> one side , this <unk> <unk> <unk> a series of <unk> , <unk> and <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
<unk> the only <unk> <unk> a little <unk> that <unk> a little bit of <unk> , but it 's <unk> with the <unk> of a <unk> of a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> said <unk> .
This <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , very similar to <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
If you 're going to see the <unk> <unk> <unk> on the <unk> , the <unk> that are doing from a different <unk> of <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
<unk> that <unk> on the <unk> is a little bit like being <unk> by a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> on a sea of electricity . <unk> doesn 't create a <unk> of electricity . <unk> doesn 't create a <unk> of reality ; it makes the <unk> of reality .
I often <unk> with my <unk> , Richard <unk> <unk> , the man who <unk> the <unk> was <unk> , with his discovery of <unk> <unk> in the <unk> .
<unk> my <unk> can 't be <unk> these <unk> as <unk> because if you 're <unk> , you can 't tell nobody of being <unk> . <unk> <unk> <unk> can 't be <unk> because of a <unk> that is <unk> by a <unk> that <unk> <unk> in <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
It 's possible to <unk> <unk> <unk> , if we <unk> <unk> with other <unk> <unk> that <unk> .
Now , the <unk> that are in this <unk> <unk> are <unk> of <unk> , <unk> of the same <unk> for <unk> . The question <unk> : in a <unk> of <unk> species of plants , how do these <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> not like that , but that if you <unk> in this way , they create a <unk> version of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the parts ?
We use the big <unk> of <unk> and <unk> , which can <unk> <unk> .
But if you look at the <unk> , we 're going to be " <unk> <unk> us . "
What does this mean ?
This <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , which <unk> <unk> in the forest , and that our eyes <unk> in the forest species .
If the <unk> like <unk> their <unk> <unk> us , " <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , the rest of the rest of them , the rest of them , " I said , " No . "
The solution is , they take the <unk> <unk> in a night of the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> with a different <unk> .
With this <unk> , you don 't get <unk> , but it 's much more interesting than <unk> <unk> .
Now , [ <unk> ] the problem is that the <unk> of us that have to heart <unk> <unk> them , but somehow <unk> to the <unk> of the history of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the history of the real world , and <unk> .
In fact , the <unk> century , <unk> , not <unk> <unk> for his <unk> or his <unk> <unk> <unk> , but rather as the was where we <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> of <unk> diversity and <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , but rather as the change .
All the <unk> through the <unk> of <unk> have been <unk> in a <unk> for new possibilities of life .
And the problem is not the technology .
<unk> <unk> didn 't have <unk> to be <unk> when they put <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> as the <unk> didn 't <unk> to be <unk> when they put <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
It 's not the change or the technology of <unk> . It 's power . It 's power .
The <unk> <unk> of <unk> .
And if you look at the world , you know that these are not <unk> <unk> <unk> .
They 're <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> out of the <unk> forces that go beyond their <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> --
a <unk> <unk> <unk> , where the <unk> <unk> <unk> , a <unk> that lived in the forest to a generation of the <unk> , and now <unk> to the <unk> of <unk> , where you can see the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , where the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , where the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , where the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , where the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> ,
I started <unk> the <unk> with the <unk> <unk> <unk> to the forest .
Or in the case of <unk> , are the diseases that are <unk> with the <unk> discovery of <unk> .
If you <unk> on the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> , you 'll see the <unk> <unk> of politics .
As <unk> <unk> , the physics of a <unk> , <unk> physics of a <unk> , but <unk> , the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of a <unk> , not just <unk> , but <unk> <unk> <unk> in certain <unk> , because it 's <unk> <unk> .
And you can 't understand the <unk> of the <unk> until you start from the beginning .
I <unk> the <unk> miles from <unk> in the Western <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> to <unk> with a young <unk> , but just <unk> <unk> <unk> , I realized what 's behind the <unk> that I could talk about .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> million people <unk> from the <unk> <unk> during the <unk> <unk> .
The father of this guy was <unk> to <unk> <unk> .
And that means that it was <unk> to the <unk> of Chinese times .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> that led the <unk> in <unk> .
My mother was <unk> and his <unk> was <unk> .
It was taken of <unk> in <unk> <unk> at the age of two years <unk> <unk> his <unk> because she couldn 't live without him .
<unk> , who did the same , was <unk> in <unk> <unk> .
One day he <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> and , for this <unk> , was <unk> to <unk> for seven years .
The pain of <unk> can be <unk> , but the <unk> <unk> of <unk> is <unk> <unk> .
<unk> , all of all , you <unk> to a choice .
Do you live in the <unk> world or we want to <unk> the <unk> world of diversity ?
The great <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , before die said that his greatest fear was that , in our <unk> to go to this <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of the human imagination , not just <unk> the whole <unk> of the human imagination <unk> to a <unk> <unk> of thinking , but a day we <unk> us <unk> that there were other possibilities .
And it 's <unk> that our species is <unk> for <unk> years .
<unk> <unk> , who has <unk> us , and he did <unk> us to <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> with the <unk> of <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , and we talk about <unk> years ago .
The <unk> world has <unk> 300 years .
That <unk> story , I didn 't know , I have the answers to all the challenges that we can <unk> to <unk> in <unk> .
When these <unk> <unk> <unk> of the world is asked what it means to be human , <unk> with <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And that 's in these answers that we all <unk> the chance of being what we are , a <unk> species , that has to <unk> , all the <unk> can <unk> . And there are big moments of <unk> .
I <unk> this picture on the <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> , and I went to <unk> <unk> with <unk> , and this man , <unk> me , <unk> me the wonderful story of his <unk> .
The <unk> government was not always <unk> <unk> with <unk> <unk> <unk> and in the ' <unk> for <unk> our <unk> , we <unk> them in <unk> .
The <unk> of this man <unk> <unk> .
<unk> , family , <unk> for his life , <unk> <unk> away all of the <unk> , and all his <unk> .
You know , you know , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> it .
The <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> of this man didn 't <unk> <unk> by the night or <unk> <unk> <unk> .
It 's <unk> <unk> , and it <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> in your hand . When I did it <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
He <unk> <unk> on the <unk> of this <unk> <unk> of <unk> and when <unk> <unk> <unk> , he <unk> a dog .
He <unk> the dog and created a <unk> , with <unk> <unk> <unk> has created a <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> .
<unk> to talk about <unk> with nothing ? [ [ [ <unk> ] . And this , in different ways , [ <unk> ] is the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the world .
<unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> government <unk> to <unk> the <unk> of a <unk> area of a <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> .
It 's their new <unk> . It 's called <unk> .
It 's a <unk> <unk> . <unk> all the <unk> resources .
One <unk> example of how a <unk> can <unk> with his <unk> .
And , finally , I think it 's pretty <unk> at least at least <unk> who 's been in these <unk> <unk> of the planet , realize that they 're not going to be <unk> at all .
For somebody is home .
<unk> <unk> of the human imagination that <unk> at the <unk> of the time . And for us all , the dreams of these children , like the dreams of our children , become part of the <unk> hope of the <unk> <unk> .
So , we <unk> <unk> <unk> we are <unk> that <unk> never <unk> to anything .
I think <unk> --
[ <unk> ] [ <unk> ] , but we believe that stories can change the world , and perhaps we 're the best <unk> to tell the stories of the world . Every month our site <unk> <unk> million <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> our <unk> <unk> .
Our <unk> are <unk> by millions of people .
Our work is <unk> in <unk> to bring our audience in places to <unk> <unk> <unk> from which <unk> <unk> from which <unk> <unk> from which <unk> <unk> from which <unk> <unk> from <unk> , the <unk> of <unk> : the <unk> world of <unk> <unk> : the <unk> of <unk> in the diversity , and we have to find a <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
where we <unk> all the <unk> can <unk> our <unk> <unk> .
Thank you .
I 'm going to talk about some of the things I wrote in this book that 's already heard and <unk> <unk> some <unk> , in case , in the case , not <unk> them .
I want to start with what I call " the <unk> <unk> . "
<unk> <unk> of what ?
The <unk> <unk> of all the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> : " If we want to <unk> the <unk> of our citizens " The way to do it is <unk> the freedom to do it is <unk> freedom . "
The reason is , on one side , in the fact that the freedom is <unk> , <unk> , <unk> for human beings .
<unk> other is in the fact that if we 're <unk> , each of us can do it to <unk> to do everything that we <unk> our <unk> , without no one who <unk> in our <unk> <unk> .
The way to <unk> the freedom is to <unk> the choice .
More choices people have more <unk> , and more <unk> , and more <unk> is their freedom , more than their <unk> , more than their <unk> .
This , <unk> , it 's so <unk> <unk> in the society that no one <unk> of <unk> in <unk> .
And it 's also <unk> <unk> in our lives .
I 'm going to show you some examples of what progress has made possible .
This is my <unk> . It 's not particularly big .
I got a simple <unk> on the <unk> to <unk> .
In my <unk> , there are <unk> <unk> , without <unk> the 10 <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> and <unk> <unk> that you can buy for a huge <unk> number of <unk> in <unk> <unk> that no one of <unk> in the <unk> <unk> that no one of the <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> that no one of the <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Here 's what the <unk> .
Then you go to the <unk> <unk> to buy a <unk> : <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
And in this <unk> <unk> <unk> , there 's a big number of <unk> <unk> .
We can make six million <unk> million <unk> <unk> using the <unk> that there are in one store .
<unk> <unk> that there is <unk> choice .
<unk> <unk> <unk> : the world of <unk> .
Once , when I was a child , you could get all the services <unk> <unk> , <unk> that were <unk> by <unk> <unk> .
You <unk> the phone , you don 't <unk> it .
One <unk> of that , between other , was that the phone never <unk> .
These days are gone .
We have a <unk> almost <unk> <unk> <unk> , especially between cell phones .
Here 's the cell phones .
My <unk> is that in a middle , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , and <unk> for <unk> <unk> .
If you don 't have it still <unk> in the <unk> , you 're <unk> that soon soon <unk> .
And what happens is that people <unk> into the <unk> and do this question . And you know , what 's the answer is " No . "
It 's not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn 't face it .
So , in other <unk> of life that are much more important than <unk> , <unk> , <unk> the same <unk> of choices .
<unk> <unk> : <unk> , no longer happens in the United States that you 're <unk> from <unk> and <unk> you have to do .
Instead , <unk> from <unk> , and the <unk> says , " OK , we could do it , or <unk> , " <unk> , " <unk> , " <unk> , " <unk> , " <unk> , we could do it ? "
You know , " <unk> , what do ? "
And the <unk> says , " <unk> has these <unk> and these <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . "
" What do ? "
And you were , " <unk> if she was me , what would you know ? "
And the <unk> , " But I 'm not her . "
The <unk> <unk> we call it <unk> <unk> , <unk> that makes it look like a beautiful thing .
But it 's not that a <unk> <unk> and <unk> to make decisions from somebody who know something , <unk> the <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , and so , of course , is <unk> -- and so that it 's not <unk> to make it decisions .
There 's a huge <unk> of <unk> products , <unk> to people like me and you , if you know , you can 't think about it makes sense , because you can 't <unk> .
But if we can 't <unk> it , why ?
The answer is they want to <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> of how fundamental is our <unk> <unk> is a question of choice , as you see in this <unk> , " We don 't want to <unk> the kids . <unk> their sex at the right time . " We don 't get a <unk> : we have to <unk> it .
And we can <unk> them .
And that means that every <unk> , <unk> , you have to decide that kind of person , you have to decide that kind of person .
<unk> to the family and <unk> , a <unk> time , <unk> <unk> almost for anyone , was that you <unk> the <unk> as possible , and you can get the <unk> <unk> as soon as possible .
The only real choice was with who , not when , and they didn 't even know what to do after .
<unk> , it 's really really to play .
<unk> to very smart students , and they <unk> them 20 percent less than a time .
And because they 're not <unk> , because they 're not <unk> .
But why are I <unk> , I 'm going to <unk> , " <unk> <unk> or no ? "
" <unk> <unk> <unk> later ? I have to think about kids or the career or to the career ? "
I 'm <unk> <unk> .
And they try to answer these questions , even though this <unk> doesn 't <unk> the <unk> that <unk> and not get a beautiful <unk> to my <unk> .
And they really have to do it . They 're really important questions .
Now , the work : we 're <unk> , like <unk> <unk> , because the technology allows us to work every day , every day , from every day , <unk> of the planet , <unk> that from <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , there is a <unk> , and I 'm not going to say one , where the <unk> works .
I don 't tell you , why I want to use it .
What does , this incredible freedom of choice that we have about work ? Is it we have to decide , <unk> at every moment , if we have to work or no .
We can go to our child to <unk> , with the cell phone in a <unk> , the <unk> in the other , and the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
And even if I 'm all <unk> , every minute that we see our child <unk> , we 're also <unk> , " I have to answer this called ? "
" I have to answer this <unk> ? I got to <unk> this letter ? "
And even when the answer is " no , " all this makes the experience of your <unk> <unk> 's <unk> of what would be in other conditions .
So , from any <unk> , we look , little and big objects , and big materials and <unk> of life is a question of choices .
Once the world was this : <unk> , there was some possibilities , but not everything was a question of choice .
The world today <unk> to this : <unk> is , " It 's a <unk> thing , or <unk> ? "
The answer is <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> them all , so I 'm going to talk about the <unk> .
I 'm going to <unk> this choice <unk> two effects of people .
The first , <unk> , it 's <unk> <unk> .
With a lot of <unk> between which to choose , it becomes very difficult to do it .
I 'll give you an example of an example of <unk> <unk> <unk> .
A <unk> of my <unk> has had access to the data , the <unk> society of <unk> <unk> , with about a million <unk> in <unk> different companies .
What she found is that for every 10 solutions that are <unk> in the more , the <unk> of <unk> <unk> two percent .
With 50 <unk> <unk> <unk> , there 's 10 percent less than when they 're going to be available for five to <unk> . Why ?
Because with 50 <unk> <unk> in which <unk> , it 's hard to decide , and the choice is <unk> to <unk> .
And <unk> , and <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and of course , <unk> never comes back .
<unk> that doesn 't mean just , these <unk> <unk> food to <unk> because they don 't have enough money , wants to say that the decision is so <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of work .
They 're not <unk> , they 're <unk> to <unk> <unk> for year from <unk> of work , that would be well well <unk> .
So the <unk> is a <unk> of <unk> choices .
And I think we <unk> the world .
" And finally , to end up , for <unk> : <unk> or <unk> or <unk> ? "
You can just take the right decision , if it 's <unk> , right ?
You don 't want to choose the <unk> wrong , and <unk> the <unk> wrong .
So this is the first effect . The second is that even if we can <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> and make a choice , at the end , at the end , we 're less <unk> by the <unk> of how to choose .
And this for several reasons .
One of these is that with many <unk> of which to choose , if you <unk> one and not perfect , it 's not perfect , it 's easy to imagine that would be better . And what happens is that <unk> <unk> us to <unk> us to <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> ,
And even when it was a <unk> decision .
More choices there are more choices to <unk> than any <unk> that <unk> is <unk> of <unk> choice .
<unk> , there is what <unk> called <unk> .
Dan <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> as the value that we <unk> to do with what we <unk> .
<unk> rest , when there are many <unk> possible , it 's easy to <unk> the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> that <unk> .
Here 's one example . I <unk> me with all the <unk> that are not in New York .
But that 's what we probably <unk> .
There 's this <unk> to <unk> .
A <unk> place .
<unk> <unk> . <unk> day . It 's all about them .
Not <unk> anything . But what he thinks is , " Well , <unk> , <unk> , it 's <unk> . "
" All my <unk> <unk> <unk> are away . "
" <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in front of the house . "
And it <unk> two weeks from the idea that 's <unk> -- every day -- the chance of <unk> where you want .
The <unk> <unk> <unk> for what we have , even when the choice was <unk> .
And the <unk> are the <unk> that we have from <unk> , the <unk> <unk> us against how to <unk> .
Here 's another example .
This <unk> tells us a lot of things .
We talk about the moment , and maybe in the <unk> of the slowly of the <unk> .
But the most important point is that anything you 're going to , you 're going to be <unk> to not do the other .
The things that don 't have a lot of <unk> that can make it less <unk> what we do .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
I tried it on my skin <unk> a new <unk> of <unk> .
<unk> almost always <unk> .
Once the <unk> were just a kind of <unk> them and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> , were <unk> , just after <unk> <unk> a life and <unk> a lot of times , <unk> to go out .
So , I went to <unk> a couple of <unk> when the <unk> were gone , and I said , " I need a couple of <unk> , this is my <unk> . "
And <unk> said , " You want to <unk> them , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> ? "
Do you want them to <unk> or <unk> ? "
" You want them to <unk> ? "
" <unk> <unk> <unk> them or <unk> ? <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> -- " <unk> to <unk> .
I was <unk> , and after a little bit I was able to say , " I want the guy -- that was the only guy , " I want to <unk> me all of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , then <unk> me all of the <unk> <unk> <unk> , then <unk> <unk> from the <unk> I 've ever had .
It was the <unk> . With all that choice I had <unk> the better .
But I 'm going to <unk> me .
Why ? I wrote a whole book for <unk> .
The reason I was worse is that with all that choice , my <unk> were <unk> , the <unk> <unk> to be <unk> .
I had <unk> <unk> . I didn 't know it was <unk> me , I just had a <unk> <unk> , but when I was <unk> 100 different , at least one kind of had to be perfect .
What I had <unk> was good , but not perfect .
After <unk> , I <unk> that I was <unk> in <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> in the life of people don 't do that <unk> the <unk> that these <unk> <unk> of the same <unk> .
And this <unk> less <unk> , even when the results are good .
<unk> in the world of <unk> <unk> if it makes it .
Because if you know , I 'm not going to talk about what I 'm talking about .
The truth is more than this .
" And he was better when he was <unk> , " The reason he was <unk> when you know , the <unk> was <unk> , and it was <unk> as well as the <unk> was possible <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
<unk> , in the world that we live in -- <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> that we can <unk> is that things is that things are <unk> to the <unk> of <unk> .
You 've never <unk> <unk> , because your <unk> , my <unk> , <unk> , <unk> are <unk> .
The <unk> of happiness -- what you 're here -- is , " <unk> <unk> <unk> " Yes , you want to do it . "
I mean , little <unk> moment -- that I 'm really <unk> and my wife is really <unk> .
I couldn 't do better , I didn 't <unk> me .
But <unk> , it 's not always a <unk> thing .
<unk> , a <unk> of <unk> <unk> a couple of <unk> <unk> <unk> when there is just that kind of <unk> is that when you 're not <unk> , and I 'm going to ask , " Why ? "
" Who is <unk> ? " <unk> is <unk> .
The world is the <unk> . What could we do it ?
When there are hundreds of <unk> <unk> , and you <unk> a <unk> , and you <unk> a <unk> , and you 'll <unk> you who is <unk> , <unk> that <unk> you are .
I could do better .
With hundreds of <unk> <unk> available , there are no <unk> for <unk> .
So when people make decisions , even though the <unk> is <unk> , they <unk> <unk> and give them their own <unk> .
In the last few years , the <unk> is <unk> in the <unk> world .
I think a <unk> <unk> -- not the only , but important -- this <unk> of <unk> <unk> is just that people have <unk> experiences because the standard of <unk> are too <unk> .
And when they have to <unk> this situation think the <unk> is them .
So the final result is that in general , we 're better , but we 're going to <unk> it .
Let me <unk> you .
This is the <unk> <unk> , what we all take for good and it 's completely <unk> . It 's not true .
There is no <unk> that a little bit better than <unk> , but from this is not <unk> , but from this is not <unk> that much choice is better than a little bit better than a little bit .
There is a <unk> value , <unk> . I don 't know what it is .
But I 'm pretty sure we have <unk> from a piece of the level where the choices <unk> our life .
Now , from the <unk> <unk> -- I 've been almost finished -- from the <unk> of <unk> , the <unk> is the <unk> .
What allows all this choice in the <unk> society is the <unk> material .
There are many places in the world , and you know , <unk> <unk> , where the problem is not that they have <unk> choice .
The problem is they have too <unk> .
So the <unk> I 'm talking about is a <unk> <unk> of <unk> , <unk> society .
And what <unk> does <unk> and <unk> is this : <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> you yesterday about how those <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> . It 's a <unk> of money .
I mean that these choices , <unk> and <unk> , it 's not just <unk> <unk> .
I 'm <unk> <unk> .
They 're <unk> .
If a little bit of what we have in our society <unk> choice was <unk> in those where people have too few <unk> , it would not just be their life to <unk> , but also our own life .
This is what <unk> call a <unk> <unk> .
A <unk> of income does good for everybody -- not just the poor people -- because of this choice in <unk> that we 're going to be <unk> .
And to end , " <unk> , you can become everything you want to be , "
<unk> , people , <unk> people , " But what do that fish ? "
" It 's <unk> that can 't make any <unk> in a glass <unk> . "
" A <unk> imagination , a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> --
and <unk> I <unk> it so , at the beginning .
But then , <unk> , <unk> , I realized that that fish knows that fish knows that fish know the long <unk> .
Because the reality of <unk> is that if you <unk> the <unk> , you know , " everything is possible as possible as you can 't <unk> the freedom . You can 't <unk> the freedom .
If you <unk> the <unk> <unk> in a way that we could <unk> the <unk> .
<unk> the <unk> , and <unk> <unk> .
They all need a <unk> .
This is almost certainly too <unk> , maybe even for the fish , and certainly for us .
But the <unk> of some <unk> <unk> is a <unk> for <unk> and <unk> , <unk> , for <unk> .
Thank you very much .
