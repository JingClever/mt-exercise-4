<unk> year I showed these <unk> to <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , which for almost three million years old old old <unk> , <unk> of the United States , <unk> , <unk> of 40 percent .
And this <unk> <unk> of the problem because it doesn 't show the <unk> of ice .
<unk> <unk> <unk> is , in a sense , the <unk> heart of climate change .
They <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
The next <unk> is going to be a <unk> <unk> <unk> on the <unk> of the last 25 years .
The <unk> <unk> are <unk> in red .
You can see , you get <unk> up to the blue <unk> .
That 's the ice in <unk> , which <unk> <unk> in summer .
You can see that the <unk> ice <unk> , of five years or more , it 's like the blood , which here is from the body .
In 25 years , in the past , like this .
This is a problem because the <unk> <unk> <unk> around the <unk> <unk> around the ocean there are huge <unk> of <unk> that , <unk> , are <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> to the <unk> of <unk> <unk> by global <unk> , the amount of <unk> could <unk> , <unk> this point of not <unk> .
In some <unk> , <unk> <unk> is already <unk> by the water .
The <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> ! <unk> : She 's good . The question is if you <unk> it .
A reason is that this <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> from the north .
This is a <unk> river <unk> .
The <unk> had never <unk> <unk> <unk> .
This is the <unk> river <unk> , in the <unk> of <unk> .
If you want to know how the <unk> level of the sea <unk> <unk> on <unk> , here is where the sea <unk> .
These <unk> are <unk> <unk> .
On the other part of the planet : <unk> , the biggest <unk> of ice on the planet .
The last month scientists have <unk> that the <unk> of ice is in <unk> , and that the <unk> <unk> , which <unk> on some <unk> <unk> , is particularly <unk> in the <unk> .
<unk> at six feet of the <unk> level , like <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> of ice , you see new <unk> , that a few years ago were <unk> .
<unk> percent of the world population <unk> <unk> water from that <unk> .
<unk> <unk> : this <unk> is the source of <unk> water of this city .
<unk> is <unk> .
But when you <unk> , the same happens to the <unk> water .
In California , <unk> <unk> <unk> is 40 percent of the 40 percent .
<unk> <unk> are <unk> .
The <unk> , like you read , they 're <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> in the world <unk> <unk> to a <unk> <unk> of <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> are <unk> to a normal <unk> out of the normal and without <unk> .
<unk> times more <unk> in the last 30 years than <unk> <unk> .
This is a <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
If you look at it in the context of them can see the <unk> .
In the last five years , we 've <unk> 70 million <unk> of CO2 every day .
Look at the <unk> area of <unk> <unk> , from <unk> , to <unk> , and both parts of the <unk> <unk> , where there 's a <unk> <unk> of oxygen in the ocean .
The biggest cause of global warming , together to <unk> , which is 20 percent , is the use of <unk> <unk> .
The oil is a problem , and <unk> is even worse .
The United States is one of the two countries with the <unk> emissions , together .
And they 're going to build a lot of other <unk> <unk> .
But we 're <unk> to a <unk> of direction .
These are the <unk> projects in the last last years and some <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
And at all , there 's a <unk> politics in our country .
The <unk> of <unk> and oil <unk> have <unk> million dollars in the last year to <unk> <unk> <unk> , which is a <unk> .
I was going to be something --
<unk> <unk> , in <unk> , where I live , there was a <unk> of <unk> billion <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
You may have seen it on the <unk> .
This is the biggest flow of <unk> in America .
It 's happened around <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> of one of <unk> <unk> was this .
<unk> : <unk> ♫ ♫ <unk> the <unk> is a <unk> and happy guy .
It 's <unk> here in America , and grow our economy .
<unk> the <unk> is more <unk> .
It 's a good price , <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> here is a lot of <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The biggest <unk> society on the <unk> is <unk> <unk> . This is his <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> <unk> -- Al <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> -- not know what they 're talking about .
<unk> : So the <unk> for the <unk> of <unk> has <unk> two <unk> .
This is one of them , one part .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> , we see the <unk> changes as a <unk> <unk> <unk> to our business .
And so our <unk> is a great amount of money in a <unk> <unk> to make public and <unk> the truth on <unk> .
In fact , <unk> is not <unk> .
We think it 's <unk> -- it also has a good <unk> .
So , not <unk> of climate change .
We 're going to do it .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> <unk> -- you 've heard of it .
So , I <unk> a <unk> structure as <unk> as <unk> .
<unk> ! The machines are a little <unk> , but this is the sound of <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> is the major <unk> of global warming , but the <unk> <unk> technology of <unk> that you can see everything .
<unk> a look : this is the <unk> <unk> technology .
<unk> : <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to the economic issue and the national security .
<unk> : <unk> America is in the crisis ; the national security , the national <unk> , the <unk> crisis .
The <unk> that <unk> all : our <unk> from <unk> <unk> <unk> , like <unk> and oil <unk> .
Now , there 's a new , <unk> <unk> solution to <unk> .
<unk> America : 100 percent of <unk> energy , in 10 years .
A plan to <unk> America to work , more <unk> <unk> , and help us <unk> the global warming .
<unk> , a solution that we 're going to solve our problems .
<unk> America . <unk> more .
<unk> : This is the last one .
<unk> : <unk> of <unk> energy to America .
One of the most <unk> of <unk> <unk> at the end of the <unk> that <unk> our planet .
<unk> : The future is here . <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , a new network network .
<unk> <unk> two : <unk> <unk> for jobs .
<unk> : <unk> America . It 's time to be <unk> .
<unk> : A old <unk> <unk> says , " If you want to go <unk> , you go out .
If you want to go away , you go together . "
We have to go far , quickly .
Thank you very much .
<unk> year at TED , I did a <unk> <unk> on <unk> .
And I 'm going to try to <unk> how the car works .
So , I 'm going to go . And for those who was not , the <unk> is the biggest scientific experiment that ever <unk> -- <unk> miles .
His job is to <unk> the conditions that were there less than a <unk> of the universe -- until <unk> million times a second of the universe -- to <unk> million times a second .
All that 's just <unk> .
This is the machine under the <unk> .
They <unk> these <unk> <unk> into the <unk> .
This is what I work . It 's called <unk> -- <unk> feet and it has a <unk> <unk> .
This is a <unk> picture of <unk> in building so you can see the <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> last year we <unk> the car car for the first time .
And this picture was <unk> by <unk> <unk> .
It was to <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> .
It 's a picture of the first <unk> of particles that had done all around the <unk> , <unk> , with a part of the <unk> , and <unk> particles inside the <unk> .
In other words , when I <unk> that image the 10 <unk> , I 'm going to <unk> that the car <unk> , which is a great <unk> .
I don 't know if it was this to make us <unk> than this , when somebody <unk> on Google and I <unk> that the <unk> page was this .
That means that we had a <unk> <unk> <unk> beyond that scientific scientific .
<unk> a week later , there was a problem with the car , had to just these <unk> here -- these <unk> <unk> .
These <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> when the car works at the <unk> <unk> .
Now , the <unk> between you <unk> the <unk> and <unk> , " It 's not true . They 're too <unk> . "
And instead can do it because when they 're very <unk> become the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
So , at least <unk> degrees , at a <unk> temperature <unk> at the space of stars , these <unk> can bring that <unk> .
In one of the <unk> of the most of <unk> <unk> in the <unk> , there was a <unk> of <unk> .
So the <unk> <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a electric <unk> .
This was the result .
Now , this is even more <unk> if you think that these <unk> <unk> more than 20 <unk> , and that 's about 30 <unk> .
They 're <unk> about 50 <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , what we did .
We <unk> them and <unk> .
They 're all <unk> at their <unk> place .
<unk> the end of <unk> the <unk> will be again .
The <unk> , and we get some data to <unk> or <unk> , and we 're going to keep <unk> and so our <unk> <unk> to find out what the universe are .
Now , of course , in a way , these <unk> <unk> the <unk> of science and engineering engineering <unk> . It 's easy to <unk> .
I think that the fact that it 's hard , the fact that it 's the value of things like <unk> .
I want to end with the words of a <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , which , <unk> , <unk> of <unk> experiments of his <unk> , his <unk> was Michael <unk> , said , " No is so much <unk> for the <unk> of the human mind as the ideas of science is <unk> , that our <unk> are not <unk> , and that our <unk> are <unk> , and that there are not <unk> by <unk> , and that there are not <unk> . "
Thank you .
I want to start <unk> to <unk> when , from children , <unk> with <unk> .
As I was <unk> and <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> is <unk> <unk> to the way we <unk> in the world around us .
So , from <unk> <unk> from the <unk> of our <unk> with <unk> objects , together to my <unk> <unk> , and my <unk> <unk> <unk> , I started to <unk> , " And if we use a computer , instead of having the only <unk> of the <unk> <unk> as digital <unk> that it moves on a <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
and <unk> to our <unk> ?
The question was so interesting that I decided to explore the answer , building <unk> .
In a few words , a <unk> is a <unk> computer as a <unk> .
In a few words , a <unk> is a <unk> computer as a <unk> .
You can <unk> them with the hand , can be <unk> <unk> , and they can feel the movement and they have a <unk> <unk> .
But <unk> , they 're <unk> objects , like <unk> , can just <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> are the example of a new <unk> of tools to <unk> information .
And as they become more <unk> , <unk> of the <unk> of the movement , of other , and as they become more <unk> , <unk> of the other , of how we <unk> them , we can explore new and <unk> <unk> of <unk> .
Let 's go with some simple example .
This <unk> is <unk> to show you a video : if you put it in a direction , the <unk> video so , if you go on the other side .
These <unk> <unk> are <unk> of others .
If you <unk> them , you get them <unk> to what they 're around .
If they get <unk> , you can <unk> it , and they can <unk> it a little bit .
If they get <unk> , you can <unk> it , and they can <unk> it a little bit .
They also have the movement and <unk> .
We 've got to realize that one of the interesting <unk> of the <unk> <unk> was that that could use common on data , for example , " <unk> , " <unk> <unk> , " one <unk> . "
In this case , we have three <unk> <unk> <unk> as a <unk> of <unk> and I can <unk> it to <unk> the <unk> of color in the <unk> where they <unk> .
and I can <unk> it to <unk> the <unk> of color in the central one , where you get .
If you get too much , we can <unk> a little bit of place .
I 'm also <unk> <unk> to <unk> , like <unk> , mathematics and games where people can try things things , and <unk> the results that are going to try things quickly , and <unk> the results immediately .
Now I 'm --
This is a sequence of <unk> that I do with a <unk> program .
Here we have a game of words that is half the <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> , at every <unk> <unk> a letter to every <unk> , <unk> , at every <unk> , and every <unk> <unk> a letter on every <unk> , and while I <unk> <unk> , and as I 'm going to talk about a <unk> .
Then , after about 30 seconds , and you have a new <unk> of <unk> and new <unk> of <unk> and new <unk> to try .
Thank you .
Here 's the children <unk> in <unk> <unk> , I did so so that I <unk> them and I <unk> a video .
They 're very <unk> .
And one of the interesting things of this <unk> of <unk> is that you don 't have to give people many <unk> .
I just said , " <unk> <unk> of the words , " and they know exactly what to do .
Here 's other people who <unk> it .
This is our <unk> <unk> <unk> , there 's more young <unk> there .
It actually wanted to <unk> .
They were just <unk> , for him .
Now , this is a <unk> of a <unk> <unk> .
We wanted to build a tool for the <unk> of <unk> . He 's <unk> .
It can <unk> new characters in the scene , <unk> their <unk> .
It can <unk> new characters in the scene , <unk> their <unk> .
So , this is , they 're going to get the sun .
<unk> : The sun is <unk> .
David <unk> : Now it took a <unk> in the scene .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> , yeah !
So , <unk> <unk> <unk> can make the characters <unk> --
<unk> : <unk> !
<unk> your story .
<unk> : <unk> !
<unk> : It 's a story with the open , and it can decide how they <unk> .
<unk> : It 's a story with the open , and it can decide how they <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> away , <unk> .
<unk> : The last example I have time to show you is a tool , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> music .
It 's a <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , to <unk> and <unk> music .
The <unk> here is <unk> as a <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> of these have four different <unk> , and you can choose which to use .
You can also <unk> these <unk> in a <unk> sequence .
And I just <unk> by doing a " sound " and a sequence . "
These are actually that you can be alive , like <unk> and <unk> .
And I 'm going to <unk> it to a particular sound , and then <unk> to <unk> .
And then there are the <unk> effects as long and <unk> , who <unk> at the whole sequence .
It 's <unk> like this .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> , " <unk> in a series , " <unk> in a series , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk>
Now , I 'm going to take a <unk> line .
<unk> : <unk> . Now , <unk> of <unk> <unk> --
<unk> : <unk> , and now I 'm going to <unk> the <unk> <unk> , so I can control the effect of the alive .
<unk> : <unk> : I can <unk> the whole sequence of time on one side or the other .
<unk> : <unk> , and now <unk> the <unk> <unk> to give more <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> , I can <unk> the sequence " <unk> " <unk> " <unk> "
So I don 't have to <unk> <unk> , but I can <unk> it , <unk> more or more <unk> .
And now , I can <unk> the whole <unk> <unk> <unk> on the left <unk> , " <unk> . "
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is to build new <unk> <unk> <unk> more <unk> to how our brain work and body .
And today , I 've got time to show you one of the results of this way , and some <unk> that we try to get out of the lab .
And the concept that I want to <unk> is that 's going to <unk> this new generation of objects to <unk> the <unk> media , that <unk> information in our world in our world in the way that we want .
Thank you very much .
I can 't see the time of all of you .
I 'm a <unk> .
<unk> books is my <unk> , but it 's more than this , of course .
It 's also love and the <unk> of my life .
And I don 't look like that can change .
But , I said this , something particular happened happened in my life and my career , who took me to <unk> the whole whole <unk> with this work .
The particular thing is that I <unk> wrote this book , this <unk> called " <unk> , <unk> , " which , " <unk> , " which , " <unk> , " which , I <unk> my <unk> books , for some reason to the world and <unk> a big , <unk> <unk> .
And the result is that everywhere , people <unk> me as if I was <unk> .
<unk> -- <unk> , <unk> !
I 'm going to <unk> all <unk> and say , " You don 't know , you don 't know , I 'm going to get it to me .
You don 't have any <unk> to write all the life that could create a book that can make a book that can <unk> to somebody ? "
What can you get to somebody ? "
It 's <unk> , you know .
But it could go worse , and I remember the <unk> of 20 years ago , when I was saying to people -- I was a <unk> -- I wanted to be a <unk> .
I 'm going to go to the <unk> <unk> from fear .
And people say , " Don 't you know that I 'm not going to be successful ?
You don 't have <unk> <unk> <unk> ?
You don 't have any <unk> to do this <unk> all life without anything about it and die on a <unk> of <unk> dreams with the full <unk> of <unk> <unk> 's <unk> ? "
So , you know .
The answer -- the short answer to all these questions is , " Yeah . "
Yeah , I 'm afraid of all those things .
I 've always had fear .
And I also <unk> of many other things that people don 't 't have <unk> .
As the <unk> and other things <unk> .
But , as I think about writing what I thought and <unk> is why ?
Is it <unk> ?
It 's <unk> that anybody who <unk> <unk> to be <unk> by a job that you feel born for doing .
But what 's so particular is that in the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> about health <unk> <unk> in a way that other <unk> don 't do ?
How do I father , for example , he was a <unk> <unk> and I don 't remember one time in his 40 years of activity where the asked asked her , if she was afraid to be <unk> <unk> ?
It was never -- that <unk> of <unk> John , how does it go ?
<unk> 't you know , <unk> ?
<unk> , engineers like <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> the <unk> of being <unk> <unk> <unk> .
We <unk> , we have this <unk> , and not only <unk> but <unk> of all these these <unk> of being <unk> .
And not to be another <unk> to look at the <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> that , only in the <unk> century , <unk> young and often for them .
And those who don 't have <unk> seem to be really <unk> by their <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , before I died , in the last <unk> said , " Every book a little more , " A <unk> <unk> of <unk> about the work of their life .
But we don 't know , when we say , because we heard these things so long , and we have <unk> and <unk> the <unk> that creativity and <unk> are in some way <unk> and <unk> that the art , at the end , at the end , I always <unk> to <unk> .
And the question I want to <unk> all over here is : you 're all <unk> with this idea ?
It 's good for this thing -- because even <unk> from a <unk> distance to me , it doesn 't good for this <unk> .
I think it 's <unk> .
And I think it 's <unk> , and I don 't want to <unk> <unk> in the next century .
I think it 's better <unk> our big <unk> <unk> to live .
And I certainly know , in my case -- it would be very <unk> to start <unk> to that <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in which I 'm in my career .
<unk> -- <unk> look at , I 'm pretty young , I have about 40 years .
I still have about four <unk> of work in me .
And it 's very <unk> that anything <unk> of the <unk> <unk> in the world as the work that <unk> after the world 's <unk> , and then I <unk> it out of my last book .
<unk> <unk> , because we 're all about , because we 're all <unk> , that my greatest success is to my <unk> .
Oh , <unk> , <unk> , who thought !
You know this is the kind of thinking that leads a person to start <unk> <unk> at the morning , and I don 't want to do it .
I 'm going to keep doing this work that I love .
So , the question becomes , how ?
And so I think , after many <unk> , that the way of working on and write is what to create a <unk> <unk> , OK ?
I 've got to get a <unk> distance of security between me , which I 'm <unk> , and my natural <unk> on which <unk> <unk> , and as I 'm going to get it for all this year last year , how to do we go through time , trying to find other society , and find other society , and find more <unk> .
about how to help people <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of creativity .
And that research took me to the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
<unk> because I went back to <unk> and then I <unk> back .
<unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> -- people don 't believe that creativity <unk> from men , OK ?
It was <unk> that creativity was this <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> men to <unk> the men from some <unk> and <unk> , for reasons and <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> <unk> of creativity of creativity , " <unk> . "
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> to have a <unk> <unk> <unk> from a <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> were the same idea , but <unk> that species of the spirit without a <unk> .
And the <unk> is , because the <unk> <unk> didn 't really know that a <unk> was somebody particularly smart .
And I thought a <unk> was this sort of <unk> <unk> <unk> , literally in the <unk> of a <unk> artist , a little bit like the <unk> <unk> <unk> , and that <unk> out of <unk> <unk> , and that <unk> out of <unk> <unk> the work of that .
<unk> <unk> , that 's the distance I 'm talking -- that <unk> <unk> that <unk> you from the results of your work .
And everyone <unk> that was so that you <unk> , right ?
So , the <unk> artists were <unk> by <unk> things , like the too <unk> , right ?
If your work was <unk> , you didn 't get all the <unk> , everybody <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> from this <unk> <unk> .
If your work <unk> , it was not all <unk> your <unk> , right ?
And everybody <unk> that was your <unk> to be a <unk> .
And so the people <unk> creativity <unk> creativity in a long time .
And then the <unk> <unk> and <unk> all , and I <unk> this great idea ; we put the human human <unk> on the universe on the center of the universe , and the <unk> without more space to <unk> <unk> <unk> from <unk> .
This was the <unk> principle of <unk> <unk> and people started thinking about that creativity <unk> completely from <unk> .
And for the first time in the story , you get to <unk> this or that artist as a <unk> <unk> that to a person with the <unk> .
And I have to <unk> , I think that was a big <unk> .
I think that 's going to be like like a <unk> person to believe that they 're like a <unk> , like the source , <unk> and <unk> of all the <unk> <unk> , <unk> and <unk> and <unk> of a <unk> <unk> , <unk> and <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> is a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
It 's like to ask somebody of <unk> the sun .
<unk> and <unk> completely <unk> and create all these <unk> <unk> on the <unk> .
And I think it was this pressure to <unk> artists in the <unk> 500 years .
And , if this is true , and I think that is , the question becomes , and now ?
Can we do that ?
<unk> back to a <unk> understanding of the relationship between human relationship between human and <unk> <unk> .
Or maybe not .
Maybe we can 't <unk> 500 years of <unk> thinking in a <unk> of 18 minutes .
And there 's probably people in the audience who <unk> <unk> <unk> on the <unk> of , <unk> , <unk> , do that <unk> people <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> on their projects .
You probably don 't know all about this thing .
But the question I would like to <unk> is -- why don 't ?
Why don 't we <unk> this way ?
Because it 's more sense of anything else has ever heard about to explain the <unk> <unk> of <unk> process .
A process that , as anyone who ever had to do something -- so , basically , all of this -- you don 't know , <unk> <unk> .
And , in fact , it can be completely <unk> .
I 've been <unk> this with the extraordinary <unk> <unk> , who has now 90 years , but that was a <unk> for all the life and said that during her <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> , <unk> out in the <unk> <unk> , <unk> out in the <unk> , <unk> out in the <unk> , and I <unk> it , in the <unk> , and I <unk> it , in the <unk> , and I <unk> it , in the <unk> , and I <unk> it , it , it ,
She said , " It was like a <unk> <unk> of air .
And that <unk> <unk> to her from <unk> .
And they <unk> it to get it , because she was <unk> the land under his feet .
I decided to have one thing to do , and he was , his words , " <unk> as a <unk> . "
And so I was going to go home and was <unk> by this <unk> , and it wouldn 't have to make a piece of paper and a <unk> enough <unk> , as the <unk> , <unk> and <unk> on the page .
<unk> times , I didn 't start to be enough , so <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> without able to get home and the <unk> and she would <unk> her <unk> and would <unk> <unk> through the <unk> , looking for , looking , as she said , " another <unk> . "
Then there were those times -- this piece , you didn 't know -- there were some time when the <unk> was almost <unk> , right ?
So , she was <unk> home and she was looking for the paper and the <unk> <unk> through , and he <unk> a <unk> right in the while she was <unk> , and then she said , that it was like if you <unk> with the other hand and the <unk> .
<unk> the <unk> from the tail and the <unk> in her body and the <unk> on the page .
And in these cases , the <unk> would be <unk> on the <unk> page and <unk> but <unk> , the <unk> at the last word .
So when I <unk> it -- it 's <unk> , it 's <unk> , it 's <unk> to my <unk> process .
Not all my <unk> process -- I 'm not a <unk> !
I 'm a <unk> , and my way of <unk> is ; I 'm a <unk> at the same day and work and work and <unk> on it .
But even me in my <unk> , I <unk> against that thing , sometimes .
And I 'm going to <unk> that many of you <unk> it .
You know , even though the work and the ideas <unk> me from a certain source , I could not <unk> <unk> .
And what is this thing ?
And how can we <unk> it in a way that we don 't <unk> your head , but rather , what 's the <unk> <unk> ?
For how I 'm about , the best example I 've got is the <unk> <unk> <unk> , which I 've <unk> years ago for a <unk> .
<unk> talking about this , and you know , <unk> , for the <unk> of life was the <unk> of the <unk> artist <unk> , trying to control , <unk> these <unk> species of totally <unk> .
But then <unk> , she was <unk> , and one day she was <unk> on a <unk> <unk> , <unk> all over him .
<unk> <unk> , and it 's a <unk> <unk> , this little <unk> of <unk> , who comes in his head as the <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> , you know , it 's wonderful , and the <unk> , but not know how to <unk> .
It 's not a piece of paper , it doesn 't have a <unk> , it doesn 't have a <unk> .
So it starts to feel this kind of <unk> <unk> <unk> in him , like , " I 'm going to lose , and <unk> <unk> from this <unk> song .
I 'm not enough <unk> , and I can 't <unk> it . "
And instead of going to go to the <unk> , they <unk> .
<unk> the whole <unk> process and made something completely new .
I just <unk> the sky and said , " <unk> , don 't you see that I 'm <unk> ? "
" You know , you know , you can write a song now ?
If you really want to <unk> , you 're going to get a more <unk> when I can <unk> care about you .
<unk> , <unk> to <unk> <unk> more today .
<unk> <unk> <unk> . "
And his <unk> process after this .
Not the work , the work was still <unk> as always .
But the process , and the <unk> <unk> that <unk> was <unk> when he <unk> the <unk> , the <unk> that outside him , the <unk> that outside him , and he <unk> <unk> <unk> back from where , <unk> that had not to have to be a <unk> and <unk> .
but I was going to <unk> this , <unk> <unk> <unk> a conversation , and this <unk> thing , and <unk> , and this <unk> thing that was not <unk> .
So how much the story <unk> to change a little bit of the way I <unk> and already <unk> me a time .
This idea , I was <unk> when I was <unk> , " <unk> , " <unk> , " and I <unk> in one of the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> where we 're going to be working on something , and you can think that it 's going to be a <unk> , that the <unk> book .
Not just <unk> , the <unk> book .
And I started thinking about <unk> this project .
But then I 'm going to <unk> me that I 'm going to go to the air and I 'm going to <unk> .
So I <unk> my face on the <unk> and I <unk> my <unk> to a <unk> <unk> of the room .
And I said to <unk> , " <unk> , what , both we know that if this book is not going to be <unk> , don 't it ?
Because as you see I 'm <unk> all the <unk> I have , I don 't have more than that .
So if you want that to be better , you have to <unk> and do your part .
OK . But if you don 't do it , you know what , I don 't do .
I started writing the same because it 's my work .
And I would like to <unk> that I 'm <unk> to do my part of my part . " Because , at the end is so , OK -- <unk> , OK -- <unk> makes it in the <unk> of Africa 's <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> music that <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> music that <unk> <unk> <unk> , and hours to <unk> .
And they were always <unk> , because the <unk> were <unk> and were <unk> .
But every long , <unk> , something <unk> , and one of these <unk> artists are actually <unk> .
And I know you know about what I 'm talking about , because I know you 've all seen , at a point , a <unk> like this .
It was like the time , and the <unk> <unk> <unk> through a kind of <unk> and not not doing anything else from the usually , like the <unk> <unk> <unk> , but it <unk> .
And it 's not a sudden just like a human .
But they <unk> out of the <unk> and <unk> in the fire of <unk> .
And when this <unk> , at the time , people <unk> what was , I <unk> it with her name .
<unk> hands and <unk> to <unk> , " <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , God , " God , " God , " God , " God . "
That 's God , you know .
<unk> <unk> -- when the <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> this <unk> with them and the <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , " <unk> , " <unk> , " <unk> , " <unk> , " which you can feel in the <unk> or in <unk> .
In <unk> , when a artist has done something impossible and <unk> , " <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> -- a <unk> of God .
And it 's <unk> because we need .
But , the problem comes the day after , for the <unk> itself , when you <unk> and <unk> that are 11 11 of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> of God .
It 's just a <unk> <unk> with much <unk> , and maybe you never get more <unk> to that .
And maybe nobody <unk> the name of God still as I <unk> , and what 's going to do with the rest of her life ?
It 's hard .
This is one of the most <unk> <unk> to do in a <unk> life .
But maybe it 's not to be so <unk> if you don 't believe , <unk> , <unk> , that the <unk> <unk> of your being being being being <unk> .
But let me just <unk> that you get data in <unk> from a <unk> source of this <unk> part of this <unk> part of your life that you have to go to <unk> when you 're finished .
And , you know , if we think this way everything is .
And so I started <unk> , and it 's certainly like I <unk> it for several months during the <unk> of the book that I <unk> , the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> ,
And what I have to keep <unk> when I feel <unk> from this is , not <unk> .
Don 't <unk> . <unk> just your work .
<unk> to <unk> your part , any can be .
If your work is <unk> , <unk> .
If the <unk> , you 'll be <unk> <unk> <unk> to you <unk> <unk> some kind of <unk> , for only a moment through your <unk> , then , " <unk> ! "
<unk> , you do the same your <unk> .
And " <unk> ! " <unk> , " <unk> to you the same .
I think , and I think it 's <unk> <unk> .
" <unk> ! " <unk> , " <unk> for you know , just for having had a human love and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Thank you .
Thank you .
<unk> <unk> : <unk> !
As you know I 've already talked about some of these projects on human genome , about what it can <unk> and the discovery of new <unk> .
Now we 're going to <unk> a new way : we started <unk> biology and now starting from that digital code , we 're <unk> into a new <unk> of biology , <unk> and <unk> life .
We 've always been trying to <unk> big questions .
" <unk> is life ? " It 's something that many <unk> , I think they have <unk> to understand at different levels .
We 've got different <unk> , <unk> to the <unk> terms .
We 're <unk> for almost 20 years .
When we <unk> the human genome <unk> to go from the world of biology in the digital world .
Now , we can <unk> life , or create new life from this digital universe ?
This is a map of a little <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> , which is the species from the <unk> genome between those who can <unk> them in the lab .
And we tried to <unk> the genome to <unk> one even smaller .
We can <unk> a <unk> of about 500 genes that are about 500 than 500 than 500 than 500 than 500 than 500 than 500 than 500 than 500 than 500 than 500 than 500 than 500 than 500 than 500 than 500 than 500 than 500 than 500 than 500 than 500 than 500 than 500 than
But when we take a look at her <unk> map , it 's <unk> simple than our .
<unk> , this is simple .
But when we look at all the genes that we can <unk> , one at the time , is very <unk> that this can bring a <unk> cell .
So I thought the only way to <unk> was <unk> this <unk> <unk> so that they <unk> the <unk> <unk> for some of these questions .
And so we started the <unk> of " Can we <unk> a <unk> ? "
Can the chemistry of making these big molecules that we 've never been able to create before ?
And , in <unk> , can we make a <unk> ?
A <unk> is just a piece of <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The speed we 're able to <unk> life is <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> .
Our ability to write the <unk> code , rather slowly , but it 's <unk> .
And our <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
We 've <unk> over 15 years ago .
The process has <unk> many <unk> , <unk> with a <unk> <unk> before <unk> the first experiments .
But we found that DNA <unk> is very difficult .
There 's thousands of cars in the world that <unk> small <unk> of DNA , <unk> of 30 <unk> and it 's a <unk> process : the <unk> is a <unk> process , the <unk> is a <unk> process , the <unk> is , the <unk> is , the <unk> is .
So we had to develop a new <unk> to <unk> these <unk> and <unk> the <unk> .
And this was our first <unk> , <unk> from information information <unk> 's genome of <unk> <unk> <unk> .
It 's a small <unk> that bacteria <unk> .
We designed the <unk> , <unk> the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> a DNA <unk> of about <unk> <unk> .
The interesting part is when we took this piece of <unk> material <unk> , and we <unk> it in bacteria , the bacteria have <unk> to read this code <unk> code and <unk> the <unk> particles .
The <unk> particles have been <unk> by cells , they 're <unk> back and they <unk> the <unk> <unk> .
I talked about recently with members of the <unk> <unk> <unk> that they have <unk> this model .
They have more <unk> than you .
And I think that 's a situation where the software can really build his own <unk> in a <unk> system .
But we 're going to do the biggest things in the big .
We wanted to build the whole <unk> of <unk> .
They 're more than <unk> <unk> of <unk> code .
So we thought about <unk> in the size of the virus , so that we can change the <unk> of a <unk> cell .
The <unk> is <unk> , and if you <unk> information <unk> into a computer , these have to be very <unk> .
When this genome <unk> this for the first time in <unk> , the standard <unk> was a <unk> for every 10 <unk> <unk> .
We found , <unk> , 30 <unk> . If you were able to use that original <unk> <unk> never been able to do it .
A part of the process is to design <unk> 50 <unk> that <unk> with all other <unk> 50 <unk> to build smaller <unk> <unk> <unk> to build smaller <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> elements here .
You probably read that <unk> us of the <unk> .
So , we have a <unk> code <unk> on four <unk> : A , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> of those <unk> <unk> together <unk> about 20 <unk> , and there 's a <unk> order of <unk> every <unk> .
So we can use the <unk> code to write words , <unk> , <unk> .
What we did at the beginning was <unk> .
Some of them have been <unk> by the fact that it wasn 't <unk> .
We designed these <unk> to <unk> just <unk> <unk> with <unk> .
There are <unk> that <unk> them and <unk> them .
And we started to <unk> parts , <unk> with <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to them .
But every step , we 've made these <unk> <unk> <unk> , because we 're going to make a very <unk> <unk> <unk> as you 're going to see in a minute .
We 're trying to <unk> the process .
So this seems to be the <unk> of a <unk> of <unk> .
When I get these <unk> <unk> , the more than 100 <unk> <unk> , you don 't get to directly the <unk> <unk> .
You get to the <unk> of <unk> biology .
So we have other <unk> .
<unk> of another <unk> called <unk> <unk> , which in biology <unk> to <unk> DNA that can <unk> the <unk> .
Here 's an example .
This <unk> , called <unk> <unk> , can <unk> three million <unk> of <unk> .
You can see in the <unk> <unk> as his <unk> is <unk> .
In 12 hours , it 's been <unk> exactly like it was before .
<unk> thousands of organisms that are able to do that .
These organisms can be completely <unk> .
They 're going to live under <unk> .
They 're absolutely sure that life <unk> in space , and they <unk> to find new <unk> of water <unk> .
And to say , NASA 's showed that this is going on .
This is a picture of the <unk> that we built these <unk> , just using these <unk> , just using the <unk> <unk> design <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> <unk> .
This image was not <unk> with a <unk> <unk> , but with a <unk> <unk> .
It 's a <unk> so big <unk> that we can <unk> with a <unk> <unk> .
These are pictures that <unk> a period of about six seconds .
This is the <unk> that we 've done a little time ago .
They 're more than <unk> <unk> code .
It 's the biggest <unk> of a <unk> <unk> ever <unk> by man .
It has a <unk> <unk> <unk> to 300 million .
If you <unk> it with a <unk> 10 without spaces , you 'll only have <unk> pages to <unk> this <unk> code .
Now , how do we make it work ? How can we <unk> it ?
<unk> , through a virus is a <unk> game .
It 's a little more <unk> when you get bacteria .
It 's <unk> even when it 's about <unk> cells like our : you can just <unk> the <unk> and <unk> another , which is basically the <unk> process .
In <unk> , the <unk> <unk> is <unk> in the cell , but we have <unk> <unk> that we 're able to make a <unk> <unk> of a cell to another cell <unk> to another and of <unk> .
We <unk> a <unk> <unk> from a <unk> species .
The two are different as men from <unk> .
We 've <unk> some <unk> in the way that we could decide what to this <unk> .
And then she <unk> with the <unk> <unk> so that they <unk> all the <unk> .
And when we put it in the cell was <unk> and <unk> our <unk> <unk> the new <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And <unk> <unk> that we don 't want to go beyond , but we 're still trying to <unk> more in there .
This is one of the biggest <unk> of evolution .
We found that <unk> species have <unk> a second or a third <unk> somewhere , <unk> in a second thousands of new <unk> to that species .
So who think about evolution as a <unk> only <unk> at the time that <unk> has no <unk> of biology .
<unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> DNA .
The <unk> that was in the cell not <unk> one .
The <unk> <unk> that we <unk> the <unk> has .
It 's <unk> , and she <unk> the other <unk> as a <unk> material , and we 've <unk> with only cell and the new <unk> .
It has become blue because of the genes that we <unk> .
And in a short <unk> of time , all the <unk> of a species are <unk> , and you 're <unk> around around around the new species , <unk> on the new software , which we <unk> in the cell .
All the <unk> are <unk> , the <unk> are <unk> , and when <unk> the <unk> code <unk> exactly at what we 've <unk> you .
Now , this may seem <unk> <unk> , but we can <unk> the software DNA can change things in a <unk> way .
Now , I 've already <unk> that there is not about <unk> -- but of progress starting from three million years and a half of evolution , and I said that maybe we 're going to create a new version of <unk> <unk> where we <unk> new species of <unk> <unk> , where we 're going to be new species <unk> on this process .
Why do that ?
I think it 's pretty <unk> when we think about our <unk> .
We 're going to go for six billion and a half a few people in the next 40 years .
Just to give a example : I was born in <unk> .
Now there 's three people on the planet to <unk> <unk> in <unk> ; it 's 40 years , there 's four .
We 're <unk> problems now at food , water <unk> and <unk> , <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> for six billion and a half billion people .
We 're going to get a little bit more <unk> to do it for nine billion .
<unk> more than five billion <unk> , more than 30 billion <unk> of <unk> .
That means percent million <unk> a day .
When we try to find <unk> <unk> , or any kind of <unk> process to be a huge challenge .
We have to realize all the <unk> of CO2 <unk> from these materials that <unk> in the atmosphere .
At day , because of the <unk> <unk> around the world 's <unk> , we have a <unk> with about 20 million genes , and I like to think that are the <unk> <unk> for the future .
The <unk> <unk> <unk> only one <unk> about <unk> , and think about how many different things are out .
Our <unk> here are <unk> data from the <unk> reality and our imagination .
Now , we have <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> of these <unk> <unk> of <unk> , able to create what we call <unk> <unk> .
We can make a big robot that can make a big robot that can produce a day .
Think about <unk> these 20 million genes or to try to <unk> the <unk> to make <unk> or <unk> , new <unk> , new <unk> , we can change , because of a small team , and create more <unk> biology now that in the last 20 years of science .
And it 's just a standard <unk> .
We can choose to <unk> , <unk> <unk> chemistry or <unk> , <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
This is a <unk> of some software <unk> that we 're working on to be able to <unk> and <unk> species to computer .
Well , we don 't know how to be .
We know exactly what their <unk> code is .
Now we 're going to get on the <unk> generation .
You 've also seen that <unk> <unk> from <unk> was a <unk> experiment .
We 've <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> that we had enough soon from <unk> to <unk> than the <unk> or different kinds of <unk> .
But the only way that biology can have a big impact without <unk> the cost of food and <unk> the <unk> would be <unk> CO2 as much as much as the CO2 , where we 're working on cells that can get this , and we can make cells that achieve this , and we think that we can have the first <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> in about 18 months .
The light <unk> with CO2 CO2 is a <unk> but in our <unk> <unk> around the world , we found different <unk> .
This is a <unk> that we <unk> in <unk> .
It 's about <unk> feet at about <unk> feet at the temperature of <unk> of water .
<unk> <unk> from CO2 using hydrogen <unk> as hydrogen <unk> as hydrogen .
We 're trying to understand if we can <unk> CO2 , that can be <unk> by <unk> , <unk> that CO2 in <unk> , to drive this process .
So , we think we can be able to <unk> what the basic question of " which is what the <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> , which is the <unk> <unk> , we have the <unk> goal of <unk> <unk> .
<unk> . If you can 't do that from TED , where can you ?
It 's a main source of energy .
<unk> , we 're working for using the same <unk> to create <unk> <unk> .
You 've seen this year with the flu , we 're always back a year and with a dollar in less when it 's about finding the right .
I think that what you can change building <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Here 's how the future could start seem <unk> , now , the tree of evolution , <unk> evolution with bacteria bacteria , <unk> , and then <unk> cells .
We 're so so much about <unk> people .
Our purpose is to make a way of living enough to try to <unk> it . Thank you very much .
I 'm going to show you , the <unk> <unk> possible , some work , some <unk> , new technology that we 've taken to <unk> almost a year ago . This is <unk> .
It 's a environment where you can <unk> is <unk> at the local level that <unk> with a huge amount of <unk> data .
Here we 're seeing <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> with a kind of <unk> <unk> and <unk> , for a <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> images as we want .
And it 's not as big the amount of information that we see , how big are these <unk> of data or the images .
Most of them are common photographs , but this for example is a <unk> <unk> from the <unk> of <unk> , and <unk> in the <unk> of 300 <unk> .
It 's not a difference because the only thing that <unk> the <unk> of a system like this is the number of <unk> on your screen at any time . It 's also a very <unk> architecture .
This is a whole book , example of data not images .
This is <unk> <unk> <unk> . Every <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And so that 's really about the <unk> and not about images , we can do something like that , to see that , is a real <unk> <unk> of the text , not a picture .
It could be a way a little <unk> to read a <unk> book .
I 'm not going to <unk> you .
This is a <unk> example . It 's a <unk> number of <unk> .
Every image is the beginning of a <unk> .
And it really gives you the pleasure and the <unk> experience of read the real <unk> version of a <unk> or a <unk> , which is for nature a <unk> of a <unk> of a half .
We also did something with the <unk> of this particular number , in the <unk> of <unk> .
We created a <unk> <unk> <unk> much more than what you use in a normal <unk> , and we <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
If you want to see the <unk> of this <unk> , you can see here .
Or other models , or even <unk> <unk> .
And this really <unk> some of these ideas to <unk> the <unk> of space on the screen .
And I 'm going to <unk> the <unk> and other <unk> <unk> <unk> , not to be <unk> .
Of course , the <unk> is one of the most <unk> <unk> for this kind of technology .
And on this , I don 't want to lose time , if not to say that we have <unk> to give this field .
These are all the <unk> in the United States <unk> up a NASA <unk> image .
So now I 'm going to go to something else .
This is actually actually live in the web ; you can see it .
It 's a project called <unk> , which <unk> two different technologies .
A is <unk> and the other is a <unk> <unk> computer <unk> , a <unk> student of Washington , with the help of <unk> <unk> , with the help of <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> and <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> . A <unk> <unk> .
And it 's alive on the Web , <unk> by <unk> .
You can see when we do this kind of <unk> , where we can go from a picture to the other and have this kind of experience <unk> .
But the <unk> <unk> of images here has actually a meaning .
The <unk> of <unk> 's computers have <unk> these images together , so that we can <unk> all <unk> <unk> <unk> on the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> have been <unk> . Here you can see some <unk> of a <unk> <unk> or <unk> of <unk> <unk> , and these things are all <unk> at the <unk> level .
I don 't know if I have time to show you some other environment .
There 's a lot more <unk> .
I want to go directly to one of the <unk> of <unk> data and this <unk> from a <unk> <unk> of <unk> that we 've done for the first time , I 'm going to go to the <unk> , the <unk> technology , the <unk> technology , and <unk> <unk> technology . And it 's not <unk> as much as the key to the <unk> .
We had to <unk> <unk> and so on .
This is a <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> images from <unk> . <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> images of <unk> <unk> and <unk> images of <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and so on . I 'm going to <unk> these <unk> <unk> <unk> a picture that 's <unk> discovery .
So they 're all <unk> images and they 're all <unk> <unk> at the <unk> level like this .
And it 's possible to <unk> this <unk> way .
You know , I would never have thought about this .
It 's very <unk> <unk> this kind of <unk> here .
I think that <unk> see that this is a lot of different kinds of <unk> : from those <unk> <unk> , a <unk> number , <unk> , a <unk> number , <unk> in this environment .
And if I can , I can go out the <unk> <unk> .
A lot of them to <unk> , etc .
<unk> here is a series of photographs -- <unk> .
This is a <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> .
We can go from the <unk> physics of this environment .
The <unk> <unk> is that we can do with social environment . This is now <unk> data from the whole memory of how to <unk> the earth , from the <unk> of view and <unk> , and <unk> all that data together .
All those pictures become <unk> together , and greater than the <unk> of parts .
You have a model of the whole <unk> that <unk> .
Think about this as the <unk> of <unk> <unk> on Earth 's work .
It 's something that <unk> in <unk> <unk> as people , and the <unk> that <unk> the <unk> <unk> with the use .
Their pictures are <unk> with <unk> <unk> from other people .
If somebody comes the idea of <unk> all these <unk> <unk> the name , my picture of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of all those data <unk> , and I can use how that <unk> to <unk> in space , in that <unk> , in that <unk> , using the picture of anybody else , and <unk> a social experience kind of <unk> and <unk> .
Of course , a <unk> of all this is very <unk> <unk> of every interesting part of the land , <unk> not just by <unk> <unk> and images and like that , but from <unk> memory .
<unk> <unk> .
Chris Anderson : I understood ? What 's good ? What your software <unk> us to do is that at some point , in the next years , all the photographs that are going to be <unk> <unk> together ?
<unk> : Yeah . What 's doing is basically , we 're doing is ,
It 's creating <unk> , if you want , between images .
And it 's <unk> it 's <unk> to the content of images .
The thing becomes very interesting , if you think about <unk> information <unk> that many of these images <unk> .
As when you get a research <unk> on the web , you <unk> a <unk> and the text on the web has a lot of information about images .
Now , what happens if that picture is <unk> all of your picture ?
So the amount of <unk> <unk> and the amount of <unk> that is really huge . It 's a <unk> effect of the network .
CA : <unk> , it 's really incredible . <unk> .
<unk> : I 'm going to give you a lot .
One of the major <unk> when you <unk> and one of the <unk> research is to be able to live in the wind , among the people who don 't <unk> the <unk> <unk> , among the past , the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of plants .
You think that <unk> <unk> <unk> still <unk> beyond <unk> <unk> , or that <unk> <unk> <unk> are still <unk> of <unk> , or that in <unk> , or that in <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> , to <unk> the <unk> <unk> , to <unk> the <unk> <unk> , and that the idea that the world we live in which is not there in a sense of <unk> , but it 's only one of reality , but it 's just a model of reality ,
the <unk> of a particular <unk> of <unk> choices that our <unk> <unk> has done , good or bad , many <unk> .
And , of course , all of the <unk> <unk> .
All of <unk> . <unk> .
We 're <unk> to <unk> <unk> .
We have to <unk> the death <unk> , so we don 't know if you <unk> and <unk> --
We all have a art .
What <unk> is the <unk> <unk> of the song , the <unk> of every culture 's <unk> .
It doesn 't matter that <unk> <unk> of <unk> , or the <unk> of <unk> <unk> , or the <unk> of <unk> <unk> , or the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> , or a <unk> in the <unk> of <unk> .
He was my <unk> of my <unk> journey in the <unk> a month ago , or a <unk> of <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of <unk> , on the world 's <unk> .
All these <unk> <unk> us that there are other ways of <unk> other ways of thinking , other ways of moving around the world .
And , if you take a second , it 's a concept that can give you hope .
<unk> , the <unk> of <unk> of the world create a <unk> of <unk> life and <unk> that <unk> the planet and is important for the <unk> of the planet as the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And you can think about this <unk> <unk> as a <unk> and you can <unk> the total of all the <unk> , dreams , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , in being by the human imagination of the <unk> .
<unk> is the <unk> <unk> of humanity .
It 's the <unk> of what we 're and what we can be as as as as <unk> .
And <unk> the <unk> has been <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> much <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , for example , <unk> that 50 percent of all the species has been or is on the <unk> of <unk> , because it 's <unk> , or -- in the <unk> <unk> , in the <unk> <unk> -- in the <unk> diversity -- and you don 't even even even even even even <unk> <unk> -- that the <unk> diversity .
The <unk> of all that is , of course , the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
When you 're <unk> <unk> <unk> on this planet .
A language is not just <unk> by a <unk> or a series of <unk> rules .
A language is the <unk> of the human spirit .
It 's the half the way that the <unk> of every culture comes in the world .
Every language is a forest of the mind , a <unk> , a <unk> of <unk> .
And of those <unk> <unk> , as we 're sitting here at least , at least half the <unk> is not <unk> in the <unk> of children .
They 're not going to be <unk> to children , which means less than something , which are already death .
What 's more <unk> than being <unk> by <unk> , of being <unk> by the <unk> , of not <unk> the <unk> of <unk> or the <unk> of <unk> the <unk> of <unk> or to <unk> the <unk> of <unk> <unk> or the <unk> of the <unk> of the children ?
This <unk> <unk> was the state of somebody in the world every two weeks : every two weeks , every two weeks , a <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> with her <unk> <unk> 's <unk> .
And I know that somebody of you know , " <unk> 't it better ?
The world wouldn 't be a better place if we all know the same language ? " <unk> , then we talk about <unk> .
<unk> <unk> .
<unk> of a <unk> thing is that I can 't talk about their language .
I 'd like to give you a journey through the <unk> --
a little journey in the <unk> to give you a <unk> of what we 're <unk> .
Many of us <unk> that when I say , " different ways of <unk> . " I mean , really different ways of <unk> .
<unk> for example , this <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , which <unk> <unk> <unk> from the <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> .
It 's a <unk> that 's not able to <unk> the blue color from the green because the <unk> is <unk> in the <unk> time , where the <unk> is <unk> .
They have a <unk> language and a <unk> rule , " <unk> <unk> <unk> , " <unk> <unk> , " <unk> a different person talking a different language .
And all of this <unk> <unk> in the past <unk> , but the <unk> is that in these families <unk> , or seven <unk> because of the <unk> <unk> <unk> nobody .
You get to listen to and then you start talking about .
And I was one of the most interesting <unk> I lived with , the <unk> of <unk> <unk> , an incredible <unk> that had the first <unk> in <unk> .
In <unk> five <unk> have <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> .
They 've been <unk> by the top photographs that <unk> them in <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> , <unk> that this <unk> forest <unk> <unk> had never seen anything .
They <unk> the picture from land , the <unk> have <unk> <unk> to a form or a <unk> , and not <unk> , they <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and they <unk> the five <unk> with <unk> .
But <unk> not only <unk> the <unk> .
They <unk> them .
<unk> percent of <unk> <unk> was <unk> by themselves .
We 've been <unk> eight <unk> and we found two <unk> of death and when we <unk> to know , they <unk> that one of them was so <unk> that he died , and then they <unk> the same . [ <unk> ] ] every way , a <unk> knowledge of the forest .
The <unk> were able to recognize the animal <unk> from 40 <unk> and species of <unk> .
I was <unk> <unk> , I was <unk> a really interesting job when my <unk> <unk> <unk> me if my <unk> <unk> <unk> me if I wanted to go to <unk> <unk> in <unk> society at the <unk> <unk> of <unk> and <unk> <unk> , and <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> .
To give a sense of <unk> , I should understand the <unk> culture and that <unk> is not <unk> <unk> .
It 's pretty much about a <unk> <unk> of the world .
Very interesting .
If you ask the big <unk> of the world , what would you say ?
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , etc . .
A continent has been <unk> out , thinking that Africa has no <unk> <unk> . And instead and <unk> is not another that the <unk> of these <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
What makes the <unk> is the <unk> <unk> of life and death .
So the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> can be <unk> by the <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> to the <unk> of the live live in such a little bit that for a second , the <unk> becomes the <unk> .
And so the <unk> <unk> to say , " <unk> <unk> go to <unk> God .
We 're going to <unk> and <unk> God . "
And what are you <unk> , is the spirit that <unk> you , how do you can you make you <unk> ?
So , you get to these incredible events : <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a rather <unk> of the power of the body 's mind when it 's <unk> in a state of <unk> <unk> .
I 've got all the <unk> with the <unk> I lived the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , in the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> of <unk> civilization that once once <unk> on the <unk> <unk> of <unk> in <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> on the <unk> <unk> .
In a <unk> continent of blood , this <unk> has never been <unk> by <unk> .
<unk> today are <unk> by a <unk> but their education is <unk> <unk> .
The young <unk> are <unk> by the families to three or four years , and live in a world <unk> and <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> <unk> for 18 years .
Two <unk> of nine years old old <unk> of <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
For all this time , they get <unk> to values that <unk> their society , values that <unk> that their <unk> and only their <unk> <unk> <unk> -- or to say the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And then the <unk> of this incredible <unk> , they get <unk> out and for the first time in their life , they see a <unk> . And in that moment of the first <unk> , when the sun <unk> <unk> of <unk> , all that they 've learned in theory is all over his <unk> . <unk> <unk> , all that they 've learned in theory , all that they 've learned in all over his <unk> . <unk> , what they 're going to learn in all all all over the <unk> theory .
" <unk> ? I 'm going to say , " <unk> ? " <unk> as I said .
It 's <unk> . Now it 's <unk> . "
They 're <unk> <unk> and they say that , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , we 're the <unk> of the world 's <unk> .
This level of <unk> is extremely important .
When we think of the <unk> <unk> and the <unk> <unk> <unk> and the old history of <unk> <unk> , which is a <unk> concept in his <unk> or maybe <unk> <unk> <unk> and say that these <unk> are closer to the Earth .
<unk> <unk> are not <unk> or <unk> by <unk> .
There 's no space for these things in the <unk> <unk> of <unk> or in the <unk> <unk> of <unk> , but because of time and <unk> , they created a <unk> of <unk> Earth , but on a <unk> <unk> <unk> , but on a <unk> <unk> <unk> , but on a <unk> <unk> <unk> , but on a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
What does that mean ?
It 's about to say that a <unk> of <unk> <unk> that the mountain is a <unk> spirit that <unk> the <unk> will be a human being <unk> , and it 's going to be a <unk> different <unk> with the mountain or that place than a <unk> of <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> that a mountain of <unk> , which <unk> is a <unk> of <unk> <unk> to be <unk> .
which is the <unk> of a spirit or a <unk> <unk> is <unk> .
What 's interesting is the <unk> that <unk> the relationship between <unk> and the natural world .
I grew up in the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> to be <unk> .
That made me a human being different from my friends who believe that <unk> are the <unk> of <unk> and the <unk> <unk> of <unk> and the <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> and <unk> <unk> that live in the world , <unk> that <unk> in the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
If we start <unk> that these <unk> can actually create different , <unk> , we start to understand some of them <unk> .
I <unk> this picture in <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> .
Maybe some of you have heard about the <unk> , the most powerful <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
What makes the <unk> is not the potential of <unk> , but her <unk> . It 's <unk> by two elements .
On one side , this <unk> <unk> <unk> a series of <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
<unk> the only <unk> <unk> <unk> a little <unk> that <unk> a little bit , but it 's <unk> with the <unk> of a <unk> of a <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> .
This <unk> <unk> <unk> , very similar to <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
If you 've ever seen the <unk> <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> that <unk> on the <unk> is a little bit like being <unk> by a <unk> <unk> of <unk> and <unk> on a sea <unk> of electricity . <unk> 't create a <unk> of reality ; it doesn 't create a <unk> of reality ; it does not create a <unk> of reality .
I often <unk> with my <unk> , Richard <unk> <unk> , the man who <unk> the <unk> was <unk> , with his discovery of <unk> <unk> in the ' <unk> .
My <unk> is not <unk> these <unk> as <unk> because if you 're done , because if you 're <unk> , you can 't be <unk> because they 're <unk> by a <unk> that 's <unk> in the <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
It 's possible to <unk> only if you could <unk> with other <unk> <unk> that <unk> .
Now it 's the beautiful <unk> : the <unk> that are in this <unk> is <unk> of <unk> , the same <unk> for <unk> . The question <unk> <unk> <unk> : in a <unk> of <unk> species of plants , like these <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , like these <unk> <unk> , not like that , but what if you <unk> this way , create a <unk> version of the parts ?
We use the great <unk> of <unk> and <unk> , which can <unk> <unk> .
But if you look at the <unk> , we 'll be " The plants talk . "
What does that mean ?
This <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , who <unk> <unk> <unk> in the forest , and that our eyes <unk> in the forest species .
If the <unk> like <unk> their <unk> <unk> , " <unk> <unk> , " <unk> <unk> , " <unk> , " No . "
The solution is : they take the <unk> <unk> <unk> in a night night , <unk> <unk> with a different <unk> .
With this <unk> , you don 't get <unk> , but it 's much more interesting than <unk> <unk> .
Now , the problem is that the ones of us who have <unk> <unk> <unk> them , but in a way that we <unk> them , but in a way that we <unk> the <unk> of our real world , and <unk> beyond .
In fact , the <unk> century , not <unk> <unk> for his <unk> or his <unk> <unk> <unk> , but rather like the was where we 've <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> , or <unk> <unk> the <unk> of <unk> diversity and <unk> and <unk> on the planet . Now , the problem is not the change .
All the <unk> through the <unk> have been <unk> in a <unk> for new <unk> .
And the problem is not the technology .
<unk> <unk> have no <unk> of being <unk> when they put <unk> <unk> and <unk> as part of them as the <unk> don 't have <unk> to be <unk> when they <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
It 's not the change or the technology that <unk> the <unk> of <unk> . It 's power .
The <unk> <unk> of <unk> .
And if you look at the world , you know , you know , you know ,
They 're <unk> creatures , <unk> <unk> out of the <unk> forces that go beyond their <unk> <unk> .
<unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> --
a <unk> <unk> of <unk> , in <unk> <unk> , a <unk> who lived in the forest to a generation <unk> , and now <unk> to the <unk> and the <unk> <unk> <unk> , where you can see the <unk> <unk> <unk> from the <unk> that seems to <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> , where the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , where the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , where the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> ,
<unk> to <unk> the <unk> <unk> to the forest <unk> .
Or , in the case of <unk> , are diseases that are <unk> with the <unk> discovery of <unk> .
If you put on the <unk> of the <unk> , where I 'm doing a lot of research , you 'll see the <unk> <unk> of politics .
As <unk> the <unk> , the physics of a <unk> , is <unk> at the <unk> level , but <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> of <unk> <unk> of a <unk> , not only is <unk> , but <unk> <unk> <unk> in certain <unk> , because it 's part of <unk> .
And you can 't understand the <unk> of the <unk> until you get part of the beginning .
I 've got the <unk> miles from <unk> in the <unk> <unk> , <unk> to <unk> with a young <unk> , but only got to <unk> what the <unk> behind .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> million people <unk> from the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The father of this guy was <unk> at <unk> <unk> .
Which means that it was <unk> at the time of Chinese <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
My mother was <unk> and her <unk> was to be <unk> .
It was taken of <unk> <unk> at age age age of two years <unk> under her <unk> because she could not live without him .
The <unk> , who did the same , was <unk> in <unk> <unk> .
A day has <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> and , for this <unk> , was <unk> to <unk> <unk> for seven years .
The pain of <unk> can be <unk> , but the <unk> <unk> of <unk> is by <unk> <unk> .
And then , all you get a choice .
<unk> live in the <unk> world of <unk> or we want to <unk> the world of diversity ?
The great <unk> <unk> <unk> , before death said that her greatest <unk> was that , in our <unk> <unk> <unk> , not only <unk> the whole <unk> of human imagination to a <unk> <unk> of human imagination to a <unk> <unk> of human imagination to a <unk> <unk> of thinking , but a day we <unk> us from a <unk> <unk> <unk> that there were other possibilities .
And it 's <unk> to remember that our species species has been <unk> for <unk> years .
The <unk> <unk> , which gave us agriculture , which <unk> us <unk> to <unk> the <unk> of <unk> , creating the <unk> of <unk> , creating the <unk> of <unk> , creating the <unk> of <unk> , creating the <unk> of <unk> , creating the <unk> of <unk> , creating <unk> years ago .
The <unk> world has been <unk> 300 years .
That <unk> story , I didn 't know that we have the answers to all the challenges that we <unk> in <unk> .
When these <unk> of <unk> of the world 's world 's been asked what it means to be human , <unk> with <unk> different <unk> .
And it 's in these answers that we all know the possibility of being what we are : a <unk> species , which has to make all the <unk> and all the <unk> can <unk> . And there are big moments of <unk> .
I <unk> this picture on the north of <unk> <unk> , when I went to <unk> <unk> with <unk> , and this man , <unk> , and this man , <unk> , <unk> me the wonderful story of her <unk> .
The <unk> government was not always <unk> with the <unk> <unk> and in the ' <unk> to <unk> our <unk> , and we <unk> them in <unk> .
The <unk> of this man <unk> <unk> .
The family , <unk> for her life , the <unk> <unk> all the <unk> , and all his <unk> .
You want to know that <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> it .
The <unk> of <unk> <unk> were made of <unk> fish <unk> in <unk> .
The <unk> of this man didn 't <unk> by the night or <unk> <unk> .
It 's <unk> away , you <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> in your hand . When I did it , they <unk> them , they <unk> them by creating a <unk> .
He <unk> <unk> on the <unk> of this <unk> of <unk> and when <unk> <unk> , <unk> a dog .
He <unk> the dog and created a <unk> , with the <unk> <unk> has created a <unk> , <unk> another dog , and it 's <unk> on the <unk> , <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
<unk> to talk about <unk> ?
<unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> government <unk> to <unk> the total <unk> of a <unk> area of a larger area of California and <unk> <unk> together .
It 's their new <unk> . It 's called <unk> .
It 's a <unk> <unk> . It 's <unk> all the <unk> resources .
A <unk> example of how a <unk> can <unk> with his <unk> .
And , to end , I think it 's pretty <unk> at least at least who 's been in these <unk> <unk> of the planet , realize that they 're not going to be at all .
For somebody is home .
<unk> <unk> of the human imagination that <unk> to <unk> the <unk> of the time . And for us all , the dreams of these children , as the dreams of our children , become part of the hope of hope .
<unk> , we 're <unk> <unk> <unk> , we 're <unk> that <unk> never <unk> .
<unk> that <unk> --
<unk> <unk> are not <unk> , but we believe that stories can change the world , and perhaps we 're the best <unk> to tell the stories of the world . Every month our site <unk> <unk> million <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> our <unk> <unk> .
Our <unk> are <unk> by millions of people .
Our work is <unk> in the <unk> to bring our audience into places that <unk> <unk> from what they <unk> away from how they 've seen and , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , the <unk> world of <unk> , the world of <unk> in diversity , and we have to find a <unk> world . And we have to find a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . And we have to find a <unk> world .
where the <unk> of all the <unk> can <unk> our <unk> <unk> .
Thank you .
I 'm going to talk about some things that I wrote in this book that I hope you 've heard of and <unk> <unk> a few <unk> , in the case , in the case , not <unk> them .
I want to start with what I call " <unk> <unk> . "
<unk> <unk> of what ?
The <unk> <unk> of all <unk> society <unk> . The <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> : " If we want to <unk> the <unk> of our citizens , " The way to do it is <unk> freedom <unk> . "
The reason is , on the side , in fact that freedom is in itself , a value , <unk> , <unk> for human beings .
<unk> more is in fact that if we 're <unk> , each of us can act to <unk> everything that <unk> our <unk> , without nobody <unk> in our own name .
The way to <unk> the freedom is to <unk> the choice .
More choices people have , more <unk> are <unk> , and more is their freedom , and more than their <unk> , and more than their <unk> .
This , <unk> , is so <unk> <unk> in society that nobody <unk> <unk> in <unk> .
And it 's also <unk> <unk> in our lives .
I 'm going to show you some examples of what progress has made possible .
This is my <unk> . It 's not particularly big .
I <unk> a simple note on the <unk> <unk> to <unk> .
In my <unk> , there are <unk> <unk> , without <unk> the 10 <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> and the <unk> <unk> <unk> that you can buy for a huge number of <unk> in the <unk> that nobody of <unk> <unk> is already <unk> of your <unk> .
This is what the <unk> is .
And then you go to the <unk> <unk> <unk> to buy a <unk> : <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
And in this single <unk> store , there 's a great number of <unk> <unk> .
We can make six million and a half million different <unk> using the <unk> that there are only one store .
<unk> <unk> that there is <unk> choice .
<unk> <unk> : The world of <unk> .
Once , when I was a child , you could get all the services <unk> <unk> , <unk> that were <unk> by <unk> <unk> .
You <unk> the phone , not the <unk> <unk> .
And a <unk> of that , the <unk> , was that the phone never <unk> .
These days are gone .
We have a <unk> almost <unk> of <unk> , especially between <unk> phones .
Here 's the <unk> cell .
My <unk> is the <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> of <unk> , and <unk> for <unk> <unk> .
If you don 't have seen it in the <unk> store , you 're very well , that you 're going to be <unk> .
And what the end is that people <unk> into the <unk> and make this question . And you know , is the answer is , " No . "
It 's not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn 't face things .
So , in other <unk> of life that are much more important than <unk> , <unk> the same <unk> of choices .
<unk> <unk> : <unk> , not happens in the United States that you 're going to be <unk> by the <unk> and the <unk> you you have to do .
Instead , <unk> from the <unk> , and the <unk> says , " OK , we can do it , or <unk> , " <unk> , " <unk> , " <unk> , " <unk> , " <unk> , " <unk> , " <unk> , " <unk> , " <unk> , " <unk> , " <unk> , " <unk> , " <unk> , " <unk> , " <unk> , " <unk> , we can do you do ? "
You <unk> the <unk> , " What do you want to do ? "
And the <unk> says , " <unk> <unk> , " <unk> , " <unk> , " <unk> <unk> these <unk> and these <unk> . "
" What do you want to do ? "
And you say , " <unk> if she was me , what would you say ? "
And the <unk> , " But I 'm not her . "
The result we call it " <unk> <unk> , " <unk> that makes it seem a thing like .
But it 's not that one <unk> the weight and responsibility to make decisions from somebody who knows something , <unk> the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and almost certainly is <unk> -- and so not in the <unk> <unk> to make decisions about making decisions about making decisions about decisions , and so not in the <unk> <unk> , and so not in the <unk> <unk> to make decisions , and
There 's a huge <unk> of <unk> products , <unk> people like me and you , that if you think about it doesn 't make sense , because we can 't <unk> .
But if we can 't we <unk> , why do we <unk> them ?
The answer is that they want to <unk> , we call the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And so , as a <unk> of <unk> , is a question of choice , as you see in this <unk> , " We don 't want to <unk> kids . <unk> their sex at the right time , " Don 't <unk> a <unk> , " we have to <unk> it . " We have to <unk> it . " We have to <unk> it . " We have to <unk> it . " We don 't know , a
And we can <unk> how many times we <unk> .
And the <unk> that means that every <unk> , you have to decide that kind of person .
<unk> to the family and <unk> , a <unk> time perspective , almost for everyone , was that you <unk> the <unk> as possible , and you get <unk> the <unk> as soon as possible , and you can get kids kids as soon as possible .
The only only real choice was with who , not when , and not even what to do later .
<unk> , all is really to play .
They 're going to go very smart , and they <unk> their 20 percent less work than a time .
And not because they 're <unk> , not because they 're less <unk> .
but why am I <unk> , I 'm going to say , " <unk> <unk> or not ? "
" <unk> <unk> <unk> later ? I have to think before kids or the career ? "
They 're <unk> <unk> .
And they try to answer these questions , even if this <unk> is not <unk> the <unk> that I don 't get the <unk> that I don 't get a <unk> <unk> to my <unk> .
And they have to do that . They 're really important questions .
Now , the work : we 're <unk> , like <unk> <unk> , because the technology <unk> us work every minute , every day , from every day , from every day , from every day , <unk> on the planet , <unk> that from the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , there 's a <unk> , and I 'm not going to say nobody , where the <unk> works .
I don 't tell you , because I want to use it .
What does , this incredible <unk> of choice that we have about work ? It 's that we have to decide , <unk> at all , if we have to work or not .
We can go to see our child , with the mobile phone in a <unk> , the <unk> in the other , and the <unk> , <unk> , on the <unk> .
And even though I 'm all <unk> , every minute that we see our child , we 're also <unk> , " I have to answer this call ? "
" I have to answer this <unk> ? " I have to <unk> this letter ? "
And even when the answer is , " no , " that makes this experience the experience of your son very different from what would be in other conditions .
So , from any <unk> , you know , things and big objects , and big objects , life is a question of choices .
Once the world was this : <unk> , there were some possibility , but not everything was a question of choice .
The world of today is to this : The <unk> is , " Is it a <unk> , or <unk> ? "
The answer is <unk> .
So the <unk> <unk> we all know , so I 'm going to talk about those <unk> .
<unk> this choice <unk> two effects of people .
The first one , <unk> , is that <unk> <unk> instead of <unk> .
With many <unk> of the <unk> that you can , it 's very difficult to do it .
I 'm going to give you a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
A <unk> of my <unk> has had access to <unk> <unk> , with about a million <unk> <unk> in <unk> .
What she discovered was that for every 10 10 solutions that are <unk> in the most , the <unk> of <unk> <unk> two percent .
With 50 <unk> <unk> , there 's 10 percent less than <unk> than when they 're available . Why ?
Because with 50 <unk> <unk> that <unk> , is <unk> difficult to decide , and the choice is <unk> to <unk> .
And in <unk> , and still <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and of course , <unk> never <unk> .
<unk> that doesn 't mean just mean that these <unk> <unk> <unk> food to <unk> because they don 't have enough money , it wants to say that the decision is so <unk> that they also <unk> the <unk> <unk> of work .
<unk> <unk> , they 're <unk> to <unk> <unk> for <unk> year from <unk> , who would be <unk> <unk> .
So the <unk> is a <unk> of <unk> choices .
And I think that 's going to <unk> the world like this .
" And to end the <unk> : <unk> , <unk> or <unk> ? "
You can just make the right decision , if it 's the <unk> , right ?
You don 't want to choose the wrong <unk> , and <unk> the wrong <unk> .
So this is the first effect . The second is that even if we can <unk> the <unk> and make a choice , at the end , we 're less <unk> by the result of what you 're going to .
And that for several reasons .
One of these is that with many <unk> of which to choose , if you get one and it 's not perfect , it 's easy to imagine that they could make a different choice that would be better . And what happens is that the <unk> <unk> <unk> us to <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> by <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> ,
even when it was a <unk> decision .
More choices there are , more easy is to <unk> than any <unk> that 's <unk> of <unk> .
<unk> , there 's what <unk> <unk> call .
Dan <unk> has <unk> very well as the value that we give things things to what <unk> <unk> .
<unk> rest , when there 's many <unk> possible , it 's easy to <unk> the <unk> of <unk> <unk> and be <unk> than the <unk> <unk> that is choice .
Here 's a example . I 'm going to <unk> with all the ones that are not in New York .
But that 's what you probably <unk> .
There 's this <unk> <unk> .
A place of <unk> .
<unk> <unk> . <unk> day . It 's all about them .
I 'm not going to get anything . But what he thinks is , " Well , <unk> , it 's <unk> . "
" All my <unk> <unk> are <unk> . "
" <unk> <unk> <unk> right in front of the house . "
And it <unk> two weeks from the idea that 's <unk> -- every day -- the possibility of <unk> where it wants .
The <unk> <unk> <unk> for what we have , even when the choice was <unk> .
And the <unk> are the <unk> that we have <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> against how to <unk> .
Here 's another example .
This <unk> tells us a lot of things .
It 's about living the moment , and maybe live slowly .
But the most important point is that anything you 're going to be , you 're going to <unk> .
The things that don 't <unk> have many <unk> that can make less <unk> what we do .
<unk> <unk> : <unk> <unk> of <unk> .
I tried it on my skin <unk> a new couple of <unk> .
It was almost always <unk> .
Once the <unk> were only like , you know , <unk> them and <unk> by <unk> , were <unk> , only after <unk> a life , and <unk> a lot of times , <unk> to go ,
So , I went to <unk> a couple again when the <unk> were gone , and I said , " I need a couple of <unk> , this is my <unk> . "
The <unk> <unk> said , " <unk> wants to <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> ? "
They want to <unk> them with <unk> or <unk> ? " <unk> " <unk> " or " <unk> " ? "
" <unk> wants to <unk> them ? "
" <unk> <unk> wants to <unk> them or <unk> ? <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
I was <unk> , and after a little bit I was able to say , " I want the guy , " I didn 't know what it was , so for a time , I 'm going to <unk> all of <unk> <unk> <unk> , and then I <unk> out of the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , with the best of <unk> I ever had .
It was the <unk> . With all that choice , I had <unk> the best .
But I 'm going to get worse .
Why ? I wrote a whole book for <unk> .
The reason I was worse is that with all my <unk> were <unk> , the <unk> <unk> to be <unk> .
I had <unk> <unk> . I didn 't know anything about <unk> when I just <unk> one guy , but when I <unk> 100 different , <unk> , at least one guy had to be perfect .
What I had <unk> was good , but not perfect .
After I <unk> that I <unk> my <unk> was <unk> in <unk> .
The <unk> of <unk> in the life of people don 't make the <unk> that these <unk> <unk> that these have respect to the <unk> of the same .
And this <unk> <unk> , even when the results are good .
No one in the world of <unk> <unk> .
Because if I <unk> it , I 'm not talking about what I 'm talking about .
The <unk> truth is more than that .
" And it was better when you was worse , " The reason why was the best when she was worse , when she was <unk> as much as much as much as you know , as you know , you know , you know , you know , " The reason was <unk> as much as you
<unk> , in the world that we live in -- <unk> , <unk> citizens with the <unk> of <unk> -- the <unk> that we can <unk> is that the things are at the <unk> of <unk> .
You 've never never <unk> <unk> because your <unk> , my <unk> , my <unk> , <unk> .
The <unk> of happiness -- what you 're here -- is , " <unk> <unk> <unk> , " Yes , you want to . "
I mean , little <unk> moment -- who I 'm really <unk> and my wife is really <unk> .
I couldn 't do better , I didn 't have <unk> .
But <unk> , it 's not always a <unk> thing .
<unk> , a <unk> of a <unk> of <unk> <unk> when there 's only that kind of <unk> is that when you 're not <unk> , and you say , " Why ? "
" Who is <unk> ? " The answer is <unk> . "
The world is <unk> . What could I do you know ?
When there are hundreds of kinds of <unk> , and you get one <unk> , and you 're going to <unk> you who is the <unk> , it 's clear that the <unk> you are .
They could have better .
With hundreds of <unk> available , there are no <unk> for <unk> .
So when people make decisions , even if the result is <unk> , they <unk> <unk> and give them them them their own .
In the last few years , the <unk> is <unk> in the <unk> world .
I think that a <unk> <unk> -- not the only , but important -- of this <unk> of this <unk> of <unk> is just that people have <unk> experiences because the standard are too <unk> .
And when they have to <unk> this situation think that <unk> is them .
So the final result is that in general , we 're better , <unk> , but we 'll get worse .
Let me show you .
This is the <unk> <unk> , what we all take for good and it 's completely <unk> .
There 's no <unk> that a little bit of choice is better than not at all , but not <unk> at all , but not <unk> that much choice is better than a little bit .
There 's a <unk> value , <unk> . I don 't know what it is .
But I 'm pretty sure we have <unk> from a piece of the level where the choices <unk> our life .
Now , from the <unk> <unk> -- I 'm almost finished -- from the point of view , the <unk> is the <unk> .
What it allows all this choice in the <unk> society is the material <unk> .
There are many places in the world , and you know , <unk> <unk> , where the problem is not that they have <unk> .
The problem is that they have too <unk> .
So the <unk> of which I 'm talking about is a <unk> <unk> of <unk> , <unk> society .
And what <unk> <unk> <unk> is this : <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> talked about yesterday about how those <unk> and <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> are <unk> . It 's a <unk> of money .
I mean that these choices , <unk> and <unk> , is not that just <unk> .
They 're <unk> <unk> .
They make it worse .
If a little bit of what in our society allows them to be <unk> in those where people have too few people , it wouldn 't be a few <unk> , but also our own life .
This is what <unk> call a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
A <unk> of income is good for everyone -- not just the poor people -- because of this choice in <unk> that <unk> us .
And to <unk> , " <unk> , you can become everything you want to be like , "
<unk> , people of culture , <unk> , " What 's going to happen ? "
" It 's <unk> that you can 't make anything in a <unk> of glass . "
" A <unk> imagination , a <unk> <unk> view of the world --
and I <unk> it , I <unk> it , at the beginning .
But then , <unk> , I realized that that that fish knows that that fish knows that fish knows .
Because the reality of <unk> is that if you <unk> the <unk> , so that you can 't be able to <unk> the <unk> . You don 't <unk> the freedom . You <unk> the <unk> .
If you <unk> the <unk> <unk> so that it could <unk> the <unk> .
<unk> the <unk> , and <unk> <unk> .
They all need a <unk> .
This is almost certainly too <unk> , maybe even for the fish , and certainly for us .
But the <unk> of some <unk> <unk> is a <unk> for <unk> and , <unk> , for <unk> .
Thank you very much .
