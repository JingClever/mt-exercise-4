<unk> year I showed these <unk> to <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> , which for almost three million years has had the size of the United States <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And we <unk> this <unk> of the problem because it doesn 't show the ice <unk> .
<unk> <unk> is , in a sense , the heart <unk> of the global system .
They <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The next <unk> will be a <unk> <unk> <unk> on the last 25 years .
The <unk> <unk> are <unk> in red .
As you see , you <unk> up to the blue <unk> .
That 's the ice in <unk> , which <unk> summer .
You can see that the <unk> ice <unk> , five years or more , it 's like the blood , that 's the blood , here <unk> from the body .
In 25 years , it 's past .
This is a problem because the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> around the ocean <unk> where there are enormous <unk> of <unk> that <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , that <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> this point of not <unk> .
In some <unk> <unk> in <unk> the <unk> is already <unk> by the water .
The <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> ! <unk> : You 're <unk> ! <unk> : <unk> is <unk> .
A reason is that this <unk> <unk> <unk> from the north .
This is a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> had never <unk> <unk> <unk> .
This is the <unk> river , in the <unk> <unk> .
If you want to know how the <unk> <unk> on <unk> , you 're <unk> on <unk> , here is where the sea .
These <unk> are <unk> <unk> .
<unk> on the other side of the planet : <unk> , the largest <unk> of ice on the planet .
And last month , the <unk> of the ice <unk> is in <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> , <unk> on some <unk> <unk> , is particularly <unk> in the <unk> .
<unk> at six feet of the <unk> , like <unk> .
<unk> , the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> of ice , you see new <unk> , which a few years ago were <unk> .
<unk> percent of the world 's population <unk> water from the <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> water 's the source of <unk> water water 's <unk> of this city .
<unk> is <unk> .
But when I <unk> , the same happens to the <unk> water .
In California , <unk> <unk> <unk> is <unk> of 40 percent .
The <unk> <unk> are in the crisis .
The <unk> , like you have bed , they 're <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> in the world <unk> to an <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> are <unk> to a <unk> out of the normal and not <unk> .
<unk> times more <unk> in the last 30 years than <unk> <unk> .
This is a <unk> of <unk> everything .
If you look at it in the context of them if you can see the <unk> .
In the last five years we 've been <unk> 70 million <unk> of CO2 in the oceans -- 25 million <unk> in the oceans .
Look at the <unk> area of the <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and both of the <unk> <unk> <unk> , where there is a <unk> <unk> of oxygen in the ocean .
The <unk> of global warming , together to <unk> , which is 20 percent , is the use of <unk> <unk> .
The oil is a problem , and <unk> is even worse .
The United States is one of the two countries with <unk> emissions , together to China .
And they <unk> to build a lot of other <unk> <unk> .
But we 're starting to a <unk> of <unk> .
These are the <unk> projects over the last few years and some <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
<unk> , there is a <unk> policy in our country .
The <unk> of <unk> and oil <unk> have <unk> <unk> million dollars in the last year to <unk> <unk> <unk> , which is a <unk> .
I 'm going to <unk> something --
<unk> , in <unk> , where I live , there was a <unk> of <unk> billion <unk> of <unk> .
You 've seen it on <unk> .
This is the second largest flow of <unk> in America .
It 's happened around <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> of one of the <unk> <unk> was this .
<unk> : <unk> ♫ ♫ <unk> <unk> is a <unk> and happy .
It 's <unk> here in America , and it <unk> our economy .
<unk> <unk> is <unk> .
It 's <unk> , <unk> and <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The largest <unk> society on the <unk> is <unk> . This is his <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> <unk> : <unk> <unk> -- <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> -- not know what they 're talking about .
<unk> : So the <unk> for the <unk> <unk> has two <unk> .
This is one of them , one part .
<unk> : <unk> : <unk> <unk> : <unk> <unk> , we see <unk> changes as a <unk> <unk> to our business .
And so our <unk> is <unk> a great amount of money in a <unk> <unk> to make public and <unk> the truth on <unk> .
In fact , <unk> is not <unk> .
We think it 's <unk> -- it also also a good <unk> .
So we didn 't <unk> of climate change .
We 're going to do .
<unk> : <unk> : <unk> <unk> <unk> -- you 've heard a lot of it .
So we <unk> a <unk> in a structure of the <unk> of how <unk> <unk> .
<unk> ! <unk> are a little <unk> , but this is the sound of the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> is between the major <unk> of global warming , but the <unk> technology of <unk> that you see changes everything .
Let 's look : this is the <unk> technology of <unk> <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to the national security .
<unk> : <unk> : America is in the crisis ; the national security , the national security , the crisis .
The <unk> that <unk> all : our <unk> from the <unk> <unk> , like <unk> and oil <unk> .
Now , there 's a new , <unk> solution to <unk> .
<unk> America : 100 percent of <unk> energy , in 10 years .
A plan to <unk> America at work , <unk> more <unk> , and help <unk> the global warming .
<unk> , a solution that we try to solve our problems .
<unk> America . We 're <unk> more .
<unk> : This is the last one .
<unk> : <unk> : It 's about <unk> energy to America .
One of the most <unk> ways of <unk> <unk> to <unk> from the <unk> that <unk> our planet .
<unk> : The future is here . <unk> , <unk> , a new <unk> network .
<unk> two : <unk> <unk> <unk> for <unk> jobs .
<unk> : <unk> America . It 's time to be <unk> .
<unk> : A old <unk> <unk> says , " If you want to go <unk> , go alone .
If you want to go far from , you go together . "
We have to go far far , fast .
Thank you very much .
<unk> year at TED , I did a <unk> on <unk> .
And I try to <unk> about how the car works .
So we <unk> . And for those that the other time didn 't have , the <unk> is the largest scientific experiment ever <unk> -- <unk> miles of <unk> .
<unk> is to <unk> the conditions that were less than a <unk> of the universe -- until <unk> million times a second .
All of that is just <unk> .
This is the car <unk> .
We <unk> these <unk> <unk> inside the <unk> .
This is what I work . It 's called <unk> -- <unk> feet and it has a <unk> <unk> feet .
This is a <unk> picture of <unk> in building so you can see the <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> last year we <unk> the car for the first time .
And this picture was <unk> by <unk> .
It was <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> room .
It 's an image of the first <unk> of particles that had done all the <unk> , <unk> in <unk> , <unk> , with a part of the <unk> , and <unk> particles inside the <unk> .
In other words , when I <unk> this picture the 10 <unk> , I <unk> the car <unk> , the <unk> , which is a great <unk> .
I don 't know if it was this to <unk> us over or this , when someone <unk> on Google and <unk> that the page was this .
That means we 've had a <unk> impact over to that scientific .
<unk> a week after , there was a problem with the car , we had to just these <unk> here -- these <unk> <unk> .
These <unk> <unk> <unk> when the car works at the <unk> of the <unk> .
Now , the <unk> between you <unk> and <unk> , " It 's not true . It 's not true . It 's too <unk> . "
And they can do it because when they 're very <unk> <unk> <unk> .
So at least <unk> degrees , at a temperature <unk> at the space between the stars , these <unk> can bring that <unk> .
In one of the <unk> between the <unk> of <unk> in the <unk> , there was a <unk> of <unk> .
So the <unk> <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> .
This was the result .
Now , this is even <unk> if you think that these <unk> <unk> more than 20 <unk> , and that <unk> <unk> of 30 <unk> .
They 're <unk> about 50 <unk> .
<unk> , what we did .
We <unk> and <unk> .
They 're all <unk> to their <unk> place .
<unk> the end of <unk> <unk> will be again again .
We <unk> it , and we try to get data <unk> or <unk> , and we continue to <unk> that <unk> the universe .
Now , of course , in a certain way , these <unk> <unk> the <unk> of science and the engineering engineering of <unk> . It 's easy to <unk> .
I think the fact that it 's so hard , the fact of go beyond <unk> , I think it 's the value of things like <unk> .
I 'd like to end with the words of a <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , which , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> was <unk> , he said , " <unk> is not <unk> for progress progress of the human mind as the ideas of science are <unk> , that there are not <unk> in nature , that we don 't have <unk> in nature , that we 're not <unk> in nature , that we 're not <unk> by our <unk> . "
Thank you .
I want to start <unk> to <unk> to when , from children , <unk> .
As we <unk> and <unk> and <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> is <unk> <unk> to the way we <unk> in the world around us .
So , from <unk> <unk> from the <unk> of our <unk> with <unk> objects , and my <unk> <unk> , and my <unk> <unk> <unk> , I started <unk> , " And if we use a computer , instead of <unk> the only <unk> of the <unk> as a digital <unk> that <unk> <unk> on a <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> up with both hands ,
and <unk> to our <unk> ?
The question was interesting that we wanted to explore the answer , building the <unk> .
In a few words , a <unk> is a <unk> computer as a <unk> .
In a few words , a <unk> is a <unk> computer as a <unk> .
You can <unk> them with the hand , they can <unk> them , they can <unk> their own movement and they have a <unk> <unk> and they have a <unk> <unk> .
But <unk> , they 're <unk> objects , like <unk> , you can just <unk> .
The <unk> are the example of a new <unk> of tools to <unk> information .
And as they become <unk> , <unk> of the <unk> , <unk> of the other , and they <unk> , and they <unk> <unk> of their own movement , of the other , of how we can explore and <unk> <unk> .
We 're going to <unk> with some simple example .
This <unk> is <unk> to show you video : if you <unk> it in a direction , the video <unk> , you will <unk> it like this , if you go on the other side back .
These <unk> <unk> are <unk> .
If you <unk> them , you <unk> to what they 're around .
If they come <unk> , they can <unk> it and they can <unk> it a little bit .
If they come <unk> , they can <unk> it and they can <unk> it a little bit .
They also <unk> their movement and <unk> .
We then <unk> that one of the interesting <unk> of the <unk> was the <unk> that we can use common on the data , to example , <unk> a color as if it was a <unk> .
In this case , we have three <unk> <unk> as a <unk> and I can <unk> for <unk> color in the central to the <unk> , where they <unk> .
and I can <unk> for <unk> color in the central one , where you <unk> .
We 're too too much , we can <unk> a little bit about it .
I have <unk> <unk> <unk> , like <unk> , like <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> where people can try things things , and <unk> the results immediately .
Now I 'm --
This is a <unk> <unk> that I do with a <unk> program .
Here we have a <unk> of words that is in the middle of <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> , at any <unk> <unk> a letter in any <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , at any <unk> <unk> a letter on each <unk> , and while I <unk> <unk> <unk> up to him <unk> .
Then , after about 30 seconds , and you have a new <unk> of <unk> and new <unk> to try and make new possibilities to try .
Thank you .
Here 's the children <unk> in <unk> <unk> in <unk> , I 've done this <unk> , and I <unk> a video .
They 're very <unk> .
And one of the interesting things of <unk> is that you don 't have to give people many <unk> .
I just mean , " <unk> of the words , " and they know exactly what to do .
Here 's the other people who <unk> it .
This is our <unk> <unk> <unk> , there on the right .
It actually wanted to <unk> .
They were just <unk> for him .
Now , this is a <unk> of a <unk> <unk> .
We wanted to build a tool for the <unk> of the <unk> . He <unk> .
It can <unk> new characters in the scene , <unk> their <unk> .
It can <unk> new characters in the scene , <unk> their <unk> .
So this is , it 's doing the sun .
<unk> : The sun is <unk> .
David <unk> : Now he took a <unk> in the scene .
<unk> : The <unk> <unk> .
<unk> ! Yeah !
So , <unk> <unk> and <unk> can <unk> <unk> can <unk> the characters --
<unk> : <unk> !
-- I 'll <unk> your story .
<unk> : <unk> !
<unk> : It 's a story with the <unk> , and you can decide him as you <unk> .
<unk> : It 's a story with the <unk> , and you can decide him as you <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> away , <unk> .
<unk> : The last example I have time to show you is a <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> music .
It 's a <unk> , <unk> <unk> , to <unk> and <unk> music .
The <unk> here <unk> from <unk> as the <unk> , <unk> .
<unk> of these have four different <unk> , and you can choose what we use .
You can also <unk> these <unk> in a <unk> <unk> .
And I just <unk> a <unk> <unk> , " and a <unk> sequence . "
These are actually <unk> you can <unk> in the lives , like <unk> and <unk> .
I 'm going to <unk> it to a particular sound and then <unk> to <unk> .
And then there are the <unk> effects like <unk> and <unk> , which <unk> to <unk> the entire sequence .
<unk> like it works .
<unk> : <unk> : <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> , " <unk> " <unk> " <unk> " <unk> " <unk> " <unk> " . "
Now , I 'm going to <unk> a <unk> line .
<unk> : <unk> . Now , <unk> <unk> of <unk> --
<unk> : <unk> : And now I 'm going to <unk> the <unk> , so I can control the effect of the alive .
<unk> : <unk> : I can <unk> the whole <unk> sequence time on one side or another .
<unk> : <unk> : And now we 're going to <unk> the <unk> for more <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> : I can <unk> the <unk> <unk> .
So I don 't have to <unk> before , but I can <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
And now , finally , I can <unk> the whole <unk> <unk> on the left <unk> .
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is to build new <unk> <unk> <unk> and more <unk> to how our brain work and body .
And today , I 've had time to show you one of the results of this <unk> , and some <unk> that we try to bring out of the lab .
The concept I want to <unk> is that 's going to <unk> this new generation of objects to <unk> <unk> to <unk> the <unk> media , which <unk> information in our world in the way we want .
Thank you very much .
I don 't see the time to talk to all of you .
I 'm a <unk> .
<unk> books is my <unk> , but it 's more of course .
It 's also love and <unk> of my life .
And I don 't look like that .
But , I said this , something that happened happened in my life and my career , which led me to <unk> the whole <unk> with this work .
The particular thing is that I <unk> wrote this book , this <unk> called <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
And the result is that everywhere <unk> <unk> now , people <unk> me as if I was <unk> .
<unk> -- <unk> , <unk> !
I 'm going to <unk> and they say , " Don 't be <unk> . You don 't know , you don 't know , you don 't know , you know , you don 't know , I 'm going to talk to me , and they say , " Don 't you know , " I 'm not going to be able to do it . "
You don 't fear to write about all life that we can create a book that can create a book that can <unk> to someone ? "
<unk> that can <unk> to someone ? "
It 's <unk> , you know .
But it may go worse , <unk> to me that I remember over 20 years ago , when I was <unk> to say people -- I was a <unk> .
I <unk> the same <unk> <unk> .
And people say , " Don 't you know , you don 't know to be successful ?
You don 't fear that <unk> <unk> you ?
You don 't fear to do this <unk> for all life without anything you ever come out and die on a <unk> of <unk> <unk> with the <unk> <unk> 's mouth with the <unk> <unk> 's <unk> <unk> ? "
So , you know .
The answer -- the short answer to all these questions is , " Yeah . "
Yeah , I 'm afraid of all of those things .
I 've always had fear <unk> .
And I 'm afraid of many other things that people don 't know .
As <unk> and other things <unk> .
But , as it 's about the <unk> of writing what I thought and <unk> is why ?
Is it <unk> ?
It 's <unk> that anybody who <unk> <unk> to be <unk> by a job that you feel born to do .
But what 's so particular in the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in a way that <unk> <unk> <unk> in a way that other <unk> <unk> do not ?
As my father , for example , he was a <unk> <unk> and I didn 't remember one time in his <unk> , in his <unk> years of activity where he was asked if she was <unk> to be <unk> <unk> ?
It never was about -- that <unk> of <unk> , how does it go ?
<unk> 't you <unk> , <unk> ?
<unk> , engineers like a group of <unk> as a group , of <unk> , <unk> the <unk> of being <unk> <unk> .
We <unk> , we have enough this <unk> , and not only <unk> , but <unk> of all kinds of <unk> , we have this <unk> of being <unk> <unk> .
And they didn 't know another <unk> that look at the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> that , only in the <unk> century , <unk> and often for them .
And the ones that don 't have <unk> to be <unk> by their <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , before she died , in the last <unk> said , " Every book <unk> a little <unk> about the work of his life .
But we didn 't <unk> <unk> when we say , because we 've heard these things so long , we have <unk> and <unk> the <unk> that creativity and <unk> are in some way <unk> and <unk> that creativity are in some way <unk> and the art , at the end , <unk> to <unk> .
And the question I want to <unk> to all over here is : you have agree with this idea ?
It 's OK , because it 's also <unk> from a <unk> distance to me not good for this <unk> .
I think it 's <unk> .
And I think it 's also <unk> , and I don 't want to <unk> it in the next century .
I think it 's better <unk> our big <unk> to live .
And I certainly know , in my <unk> -- it would be very <unk> to start <unk> to that <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> in which I 'm in my career .
<unk> -- <unk> look , I 'm <unk> , I 've about 40 years .
I still have about four <unk> <unk> in me .
And it 's very <unk> that anything you know about now , it 's going to be <unk> from the world as the work that <unk> after <unk> of my last book .
<unk> , because we 're all <unk> , because we 're all <unk> <unk> , and I 'm <unk> that my greatest success is to my <unk> .
Oh , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> !
You know this is the kind of thought that brings a person to start <unk> on the nine of the morning and I don 't want to do it .
I could continue to do this work that I love .
So , the question becomes , how ?
And so it looks like , after many <unk> , which the way of working on to write is what we create a <unk> <unk> <unk> , OK ?
I have to have to come to some way to find a distance of security , and my natural <unk> on what I would say , and my natural <unk> on what we could do do . And as we <unk> for the last year models of how to do we <unk> to look through the <unk> of the best ideas and see if you could have the best ideas and more <unk> ideas to see if we 're <unk> of the best ideas to do <unk> ideas and <unk> ,
about how to help people <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> of creativity .
And that research led me to the <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> because they <unk> and then <unk> back .
<unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> -- people don 't believe that creativity <unk> from men , OK ?
It <unk> that creativity was this <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> to men from some <unk> <unk> and <unk> , for reasons and <unk> and <unk> , for reasons and <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> <unk> of creativity of the <unk> <unk> of creativity .
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> to have a <unk> <unk> <unk> from the <unk> .
The <unk> were the same idea , but <unk> the <unk> of the spirit without a <unk> .
The <unk> is , because <unk> , the <unk> didn 't really know that a <unk> was somebody particularly smart .
And I thought a <unk> was this <unk> <unk> <unk> , literally in the <unk> of a <unk> artist , a little <unk> , like the <unk> <unk> , and you <unk> out of <unk> the work of the artist and <unk> the result of that work .
<unk> <unk> here , is the distance of which I 'm talking -- that <unk> <unk> you from the results of your work .
And everybody <unk> that was so <unk> , right ?
So , artists <unk> were <unk> by <unk> things , like the too <unk> , you know , you know , no ?
If your work was <unk> , you didn 't <unk> all the <unk> , everybody <unk> that <unk> state of <unk> , and you know , you know , if your work was <unk> by this <unk> <unk> .
If your work <unk> , it wasn 't all <unk> , right ?
And all <unk> that was your <unk> to be a <unk> .
And so people <unk> <unk> creativity in <unk> for a long time .
Then the <unk> <unk> and everything , and we <unk> this big idea ; we put the human in the center of the universe above all and the <unk> and <unk> and no longer let space leave space on the <unk> .
This was the principle of <unk> <unk> and people who started thinking about creativity <unk> completely from <unk> .
And for the first time in the story , <unk> to <unk> this or the artist as a <unk> <unk> that person with <unk> .
And I have to <unk> , I think it was a big <unk> .
I think you 're going to <unk> to someone , a simple person to believe that it 's like the source , <unk> and <unk> of all the <unk> <unk> , <unk> and <unk> and <unk> is a <unk> responsibility to <unk> human <unk> .
It 's like <unk> to someone to <unk> the sun .
<unk> and <unk> completely the <unk> and all of these <unk> <unk> on the <unk> .
And I think it was this pressure to have <unk> artists in the <unk> 500 years .
And , if this is true , and I think it 's the question , it gets , and now ?
Can we do it <unk> ?
<unk> back to a <unk> understanding of the relationship between humans and <unk> <unk> .
Or maybe not .
Maybe we can 't <unk> 500 years of thinking in an <unk> talk .
And there 's probably people in the audience who <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> on the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , you <unk> people <unk> <unk> on their projects .
You probably don 't <unk> you all about this thing .
But the question I 'd like to <unk> is -- why not ?
Why don 't we <unk> this way ?
Because it has more than any other thing I 've ever heard about to explain the <unk> of the <unk> process .
A process of <unk> , as anybody who ever <unk> to do something -- so , basically , all of here -- you know , you don 't <unk> .
And in fact , it can sometimes be completely <unk> .
I 've done this <unk> <unk> with the extraordinary <unk> <unk> , who has now 90 years , but it was a <unk> for all life and he said that during his <unk> <unk> , <unk> out in the <unk> <unk> , <unk> out in the <unk> , <unk> out of the <unk> .
He said he was like a <unk> <unk> of the air <unk> .
And that <unk> <unk> to her from <unk> .
You know , he <unk> her feet .
I decided to have one thing to do at that point and was , " <unk> like a <unk> . "
And so he was <unk> to home and he was <unk> from this <unk> , and it didn 't have to do anything else that take a piece of paper and a <unk> enough <unk> , and <unk> on the page .
<unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , so <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> without being able to get home and <unk> it and she would <unk> it and she would <unk> it up and she would <unk> through the <unk> , looking for , as she said , " another <unk> . "
Then there were the <unk> -- this piece never <unk> it -- there were moments when the <unk> was almost <unk> , OK ?
So , he was <unk> at home and he was looking for the <unk> and the <unk> through , and he <unk> a <unk> <unk> in the while he was <unk> , and he said , he was like , if he was <unk> with the other hand and <unk> .
<unk> the <unk> from the tail and <unk> in his body and the <unk> on the page .
And in these cases , the <unk> would be <unk> on the <unk> page and <unk> , but the <unk> <unk> , the last word to the first <unk> .
So when the <unk> <unk> -- it 's <unk> , it 's <unk> , it 's <unk> to my <unk> process .
Not the whole <unk> process -- I 'm not a <unk> !
I 'm a <unk> , and my way of <unk> is ; I 'm a <unk> , and <unk> and work and work and <unk> and work and <unk> and <unk> them and work and <unk> on it .
But even me in my <unk> , I <unk> against that thing , sometimes .
And I 'm <unk> that many of you <unk> it .
You know , even if the work and ideas <unk> me <unk> from some source , I couldn 't <unk> <unk> .
And what is this thing ?
And how can we <unk> to it in a way we can 't <unk> your head , but rather , what 's <unk> <unk> to do ?
And as I 'm <unk> to me , the best example I have <unk> <unk> <unk> , which I 've <unk> years ago for a <unk> .
And I 'm talking about this , and you know , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> these <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
But then <unk> , he was <unk> , and a day while he was <unk> on a <unk> <unk> , <unk> everything for him .
<unk> , <unk> , all of a <unk> <unk> <unk> , that 's coming into his head as the <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , and <unk> , and you know , and the <unk> , you know , <unk> , wonderful , and the <unk> , but not know how to <unk> .
It doesn 't have a piece of paper , it doesn 't have a <unk> .
So he starts to hear this <unk> species of <unk> <unk> to <unk> , " he said , " I 'm going to lose , and <unk> <unk> from this <unk> song .
I 'm not enough <unk> and I can 't <unk> . "
And instead of going to go to the <unk> , they <unk> .
<unk> the entire <unk> process and <unk> something completely new .
He just <unk> the sky and said , " <unk> , don 't you see I 'm <unk> ? "
" It seems to you that can write a song now ?
If you really want to <unk> , you 're going to take care of you .
<unk> , <unk> to <unk> another today .
<unk> <unk> <unk> . "
And his <unk> process after this .
Not the work , the work was still <unk> as always .
But the process , and the <unk> <unk> that <unk> was <unk> when he <unk> the <unk> , the <unk> that <unk> out of him , he <unk> that outside , he <unk> <unk> <unk> back from where , <unk> he was not going to be a <unk> and <unk> .
But I <unk> this <unk> , wonderful <unk> <unk> a conversation between <unk> and this <unk> thing and <unk> and this <unk> thing and <unk> and <unk> , but it wasn 't <unk> .
So , as I <unk> the story to change a little bit of the way I <unk> and already <unk> me once .
This idea , I <unk> when I was <unk> , " <unk> , <unk> , " and <unk> , " and <unk> in one of the <unk> <unk> where we 're all working on something , and you start thinking that 's going to be the <unk> , that 's going to be the book .
Not just <unk> , just <unk> <unk> book .
And we start thinking about <unk> this project .
But then I <unk> to <unk> that <unk> up to the air and <unk> us .
So I <unk> my face on the <unk> and <unk> my <unk> to a <unk> <unk> of the room .
And I said to <unk> <unk> , " <unk> , " <unk> , what if we know if this book is not going to be <unk> , no ?
Because as you see , I 'm <unk> everything I have no longer <unk> of this .
So if you want it to be better , you have to <unk> and do your part .
OK . But if you don 't do it , you know what , I didn 't <unk> anything .
<unk> to write the same because it 's my work .
And I 'd like to <unk> that it was <unk> that I <unk> to do my part . " Because it 's <unk> , it 's like this , OK -- <unk> it in the <unk> of Africa , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> music that <unk> <unk> hours to <unk> the <unk> , <unk> music that <unk> hours to <unk> .
And they were always <unk> , because the <unk> were <unk> and they were <unk> .
But every <unk> , <unk> , something <unk> , and one of these <unk> artists actually <unk> .
And I know what I 'm talking about , because I know you 've all seen it , at some point , a <unk> <unk> like this .
It was like the time , and the <unk> <unk> through a kind of <unk> and he wasn 't doing anything else from <unk> , like the <unk> <unk> before , but everything <unk> .
And suddenly , you don 't just like a human .
But they <unk> from the <unk> and <unk> in the <unk> .
And when this <unk> , at the time , people <unk> what was , he <unk> it with her name .
<unk> hands and <unk> to <unk> , " <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , God , " God , " God . "
That 's God , you know .
You know , you 'll see <unk> -- when the <unk> <unk> , I <unk> this <unk> with them and the <unk> <unk> in the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk>
In <unk> , when a artist has done something impossible and <unk> , " <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> ,
And it 's <unk> because we need .
But , the problem comes the next day , for the <unk> same , when you <unk> and <unk> that are 11 <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> of God is not there .
It 's just a <unk> <unk> with great <unk> to <unk> , and maybe never <unk> to that <unk> .
And maybe nobody <unk> the name of God still <unk> as <unk> , and what 's got to do with the rest of his life ?
It 's hard .
This is one of the most <unk> <unk> to do in a <unk> life .
But maybe it doesn 't have to be so <unk> if you don 't believe , <unk> , <unk> , the <unk> <unk> of your being being being being being being being being <unk> .
But you just <unk> that you get <unk> from a source of this <unk> part of this <unk> part of this <unk> part of your life you have to go to <unk> when you 're finished .
And , you know , if we think it 's all the way .
And so I started <unk> , and it 's <unk> like I 've <unk> for several months in the <unk> of the book that I was <unk> , <unk> , <unk> of my <unk> .
And what I have to continue to <unk> when I feel <unk> from this is , I don 't fear .
Don 't <unk> . You just <unk> your work .
<unk> to <unk> for your side , whatever it can be .
If your work is <unk> , <unk> .
If the <unk> , you <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to you <unk> some kind of <unk> , for just a <unk> through your <unk> , then you know , " <unk> ! "
<unk> , you do the same your <unk> .
And " <unk> ! " <unk> ! " <unk> .
I think and I <unk> <unk> .
" <unk> ! " <unk> <unk> to you the same , even for <unk> <unk> <unk> . "
Thank you .
Thank you .
<unk> : <unk> !
As you know , I talked about some of these projects on the human genome , what it can <unk> and the discovery of new genes .
We 're <unk> a new <unk> : we started <unk> biology and now starting from that digital code , we 're <unk> in a new <unk> of biology , <unk> and <unk> life .
We always tried to ask big questions .
" <unk> is life ? " It 's something that many <unk> , I think they have <unk> to understand at different levels .
We tried to <unk> , <unk> to the <unk> terms .
We 're <unk> for almost 20 years .
When we <unk> the human genome <unk> to go from the world of biology world 's <unk> .
Now we can <unk> the life , or create new life from this digital universe ?
This is a <unk> map of a little <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , which is the species from the <unk> genome between the ones that can <unk> in the lab .
And we tried to <unk> the genome to <unk> a little bit smaller .
We 're able to <unk> a <unk> of about 500 <unk> that are here .
But when we take a look at his <unk> map , it 's <unk> simple than our .
<unk> , this is simple .
But when we look at all the genes that we can <unk> , one at the time , is very <unk> that this can bring to a <unk> cell .
So I thought the only way to <unk> was <unk> this <unk> in a way that we could <unk> the <unk> for some of these questions .
And so we started the <unk> of " <unk> . " Can we <unk> a <unk> ? "
Can the chemistry <unk> to produce these big molecules that we never <unk> to create these <unk> , right now ?
And in case , <unk> , can we make a <unk> ?
A <unk> is just a piece of <unk> material .
The <unk> we 're able to <unk> the life is <unk> to <unk> <unk> .
Our ability to write the <unk> code , instead of <unk> <unk> , but it 's <unk> .
And our <unk> <unk> <unk> .
We 've <unk> over 15 years ago .
The process has <unk> many <unk> , <unk> with a <unk> <unk> before we <unk> the first experiments .
But we found that <unk> DNA <unk> is very difficult .
There are thousands of cars in the world that we <unk> small <unk> of DNA , of <unk> <unk> , of 30 to 50 <unk> and it 's a <unk> process : the <unk> is <unk> , the <unk> is long , the <unk> is <unk> , the <unk> is <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> is <unk> , the
So we had to develop a new <unk> to <unk> these <unk> and <unk> the <unk> .
And this was our first <unk> , starting to <unk> <unk> <unk> .
It 's a little <unk> that we <unk> bacteria .
We designed the <unk> , <unk> the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> a DNA <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
The interesting part is when we took this piece of <unk> material <unk> , and we <unk> it in the bacteria , the bacteria have <unk> to read this code and <unk> the particles .
The <unk> particles have been <unk> by the cells , they <unk> back and <unk> the <unk> <unk> .
I talked about recently with members of the <unk> industry that they have <unk> this model .
They have <unk> <unk> than you .
And I think this is a situation where the software can actually build his own <unk> in a <unk> system .
But we 're going to do the <unk> things in big .
We wanted to build the entire <unk> of <unk> .
They 're more than <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
So we thought we 're going to <unk> in the size of the <unk> , so that we can change the <unk> to understand what the <unk> of a <unk> cell .
<unk> is <unk> , and if you <unk> information <unk> in a computer , these have to be very <unk> .
When we <unk> this genome for the first time in <unk> the <unk> <unk> was of a <unk> for every 10 <unk> <unk> .
We found , <unk> , we <unk> . If we used that <unk> <unk> never been able to do it .
One part of the process is to design <unk> 50 <unk> that <unk> with all the other <unk> <unk> of 50 <unk> to build smaller <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
I 'm going to <unk> elements here .
You probably read that <unk> us in the <unk> .
So we have a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> : A , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> of those <unk> <unk> together , about 20 <unk> , and there 's a <unk> order to <unk> each <unk> .
So we can use the <unk> code to write , <unk> , <unk> .
And what we did at the beginning was <unk> .
Some have been <unk> by the fact that it wasn 't <unk> .
We designed these <unk> to <unk> simply <unk> <unk> .
There are <unk> that <unk> them and <unk> them .
And we started <unk> <unk> <unk> . We started <unk> with <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to them .
We 've made these <unk> in <unk> so that we 've <unk> <unk> , because we 're <unk> to create a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> as you see in a minute .
We 're trying to <unk> the process .
So , this seems to be the <unk> of a <unk> <unk> .
When we go to these <unk> <unk> , <unk> , more than 100 <unk> <unk> , they didn 't <unk> directly in the <unk> <unk> .
You get to the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> biology .
So we have <unk> <unk> .
<unk> of another <unk> called <unk> <unk> , which in biology <unk> to <unk> DNA that can <unk> the <unk> .
Here 's an example .
This <unk> , called <unk> <unk> , can <unk> three million <unk> of <unk> .
You can see in the <unk> <unk> as his <unk> is <unk> .
In 12 hours , it 's <unk> exactly how it was before .
<unk> thousands of organisms that are able to do that .
These organisms can be completely <unk> .
We 're going to live in <unk> .
They 're absolutely sure life <unk> in space , and they <unk> to find new <unk> of water <unk> .
In the true , NASA showed that this <unk> .
This is a picture of the <unk> that we 've built these <unk> , just using the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> <unk> .
This picture was not <unk> with a <unk> <unk> , but with a <unk> <unk> .
It 's a <unk> so big that we can <unk> with a <unk> <unk> .
These are pictures that <unk> a time of about six seconds .
This is the <unk> we 've done <unk> .
They 're more than <unk> <unk> <unk> .
It 's the largest <unk> of a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
It has a <unk> <unk> <unk> to 300 million .
If you <unk> it with a <unk> 10 without , we <unk> pages , we would just <unk> pages for this <unk> .
Now , how do we make it work ? How can we <unk> ?
Of course , with a virus is a <unk> <unk> .
It 's a little <unk> when you use of the bacteria .
It 's <unk> even when it 's about <unk> cells like our : you just <unk> the <unk> and <unk> another , which is the <unk> process .
In <unk> , <unk> <unk> is <unk> in the <unk> , but we have <unk> <unk> that we 're able to do a <unk> <unk> <unk> of a cell to another and <unk> .
We <unk> a <unk> <unk> from a <unk> species .
The two are <unk> as men in the <unk> .
We 've <unk> some <unk> in the way we can decide what this <unk> .
He then <unk> it with the <unk> <unk> in a way that <unk> .
And when we put it in the cell was <unk> and <unk> our <unk> the new <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And <unk> <unk> that we didn 't go beyond , but we tried still <unk> in <unk> .
This is one of the major <unk> of evolution .
We found that <unk> species have <unk> a second or a third <unk> somewhere , <unk> in a second thousands of new <unk> to the species .
So who think of evolution as a only <unk> at the time you <unk> doesn 't understand most of biology .
<unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> that was in the cell didn 't know one .
The <unk> <unk> we have <unk> <unk> .
It 's <unk> , and he <unk> the other <unk> as <unk> material , and he <unk> it , and we <unk> with only cell and the new <unk> .
It 's become blue because of the genes we 've <unk> .
And in a short <unk> of time , all the <unk> of a species are <unk> <unk> , and <unk> of all in a new species , <unk> on the new software that we have <unk> in the cell .
All the <unk> are <unk> , <unk> are <unk> , and when the <unk> code <unk> exactly to what we have <unk> to you .
Now , this may look at <unk> , but we <unk> the software , we can change things in a <unk> <unk> .
Now , I 've already <unk> that 's not about <unk> -- but <unk> progress from three million years and a half million years and a half of evolution , and I said that maybe we 're going to create a new version of the <unk> <unk> that we 're <unk> new species on this <unk> .
Why do that ?
I think it 's pretty <unk> when we think of our <unk> .
We 're going to go from six billion and a half billion in the next 40 years .
Just to give you an example : I was born in <unk> .
Now , there are three people on the planet to <unk> in <unk> ; there 's four .
We 're <unk> problems now at <unk> food , <unk> and <unk> , <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> for six billion and a half billion people .
We 're going to have to do it for nine billion .
<unk> than five billion <unk> , more than 30 billion <unk> .
That means 100 million <unk> a day .
When we try to find <unk> <unk> , or any kind of process to <unk> , it will be a huge challenge .
We have to <unk> the whole <unk> of CO2 <unk> from these materials that <unk> in the atmosphere .
<unk> , <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> around the world , we have a <unk> with about 20 million genes , and I like to think that are the <unk> <unk> for the future .
The <unk> industry just a <unk> about <unk> , and think of how many different things are <unk> .
Our <unk> here are <unk> data from the <unk> and our imagination .
We 're <unk> , <unk> to these <unk> <unk> <unk> , able to create what we call <unk> <unk> .
We can build a big robot that can produce a million <unk> a day .
Think of <unk> these 20 million genes or try to <unk> the <unk> to produce <unk> or <unk> , new <unk> , we can change , because of a small team , and create more biology <unk> biology now that we can change , with more biology now that in the last 20 years of science .
And it 's just a <unk> <unk> .
We can choose to <unk> , <unk> , <unk> chemistry or <unk> , <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
This is a <unk> of some software <unk> that we 're working on to be able to <unk> and design species to the computer .
Well , we don 't know how they 're going to be .
We know exactly what their <unk> code .
We 're <unk> on the <unk> of <unk> .
You 've seen <unk> <unk> from the <unk> was an experiment .
We 've <unk> <unk> and third generation that we <unk> enough soon from <unk> to <unk> <unk> than <unk> as the <unk> or different kinds of <unk> .
But the only way that biology can have a big impact without <unk> the cost of food and <unk> the <unk> would be <unk> CO2 in matter before we 're working on to design cells that can achieve this , and we think we can have the <unk> of the <unk> , and we think we can have the <unk> <unk> of <unk> in about 18 months .
The solar light <unk> with CO2 is a <unk> , but in our <unk> around the world , we found different <unk> .
This is a <unk> that we 've <unk> in <unk> .
<unk> at about <unk> feet of <unk> at the temperature of <unk> .
<unk> from CO2 using hydrogen <unk> as hydrogen <unk> as a source .
We 're trying to understand whether we can <unk> CO2 , that can easily be <unk> by <unk> , <unk> CO2 in <unk> , to drive this process .
So , we can think we might be able to <unk> what the basic question of , " which is the basic question of , " is , we <unk> the <unk> goal of <unk> industry .
<unk> . If you can 't do that from TED , where can you ?
It 's a <unk> of energy .
<unk> , we 're working for using the same <unk> to create <unk> <unk> .
You 've seen this year with the flu , we always <unk> back a year and with a dollar in less when it 's about find the right <unk> .
I think that you can change building <unk> <unk> in <unk> .
This is how the future could start looking at <unk> , now , the tree of evolution , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , and finally cells .
We 're at the way of the <unk> people .
Our purpose is to make enough to live enough to try to <unk> <unk> . Thank you very much .
I 'm going to do you , the <unk> <unk> possible , some work , the new technology that we 've <unk> to <unk> <unk> at a <unk> <unk> a year ago .
It 's a environment where you can <unk> is at local level that you can <unk> is <unk> with an enormous amount of data .
Here we 're seeing <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> with a kind of <unk> <unk> and <unk> , for a fast <unk> , <unk> , <unk> images as we want .
And it doesn 't matter how big the information that we see , how big are these <unk> of data or <unk> .
Most of the <unk> photographs , but this is a <unk> <unk> from the <unk> of the <unk> , and <unk> in the <unk> of 300 <unk> .
It doesn 't make any difference because the only thing you <unk> the <unk> of a system like this is the number of <unk> on your screen in any time . It 's also a very <unk> architecture .
This is a whole book , example of data not images .
This is <unk> <unk> <unk> . Every <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And to <unk> that it 's just about <unk> and not images , we can do something like this , to actually see that it 's a real <unk> of the <unk> , not a picture .
It could be a way to read a <unk> book .
I don 't <unk> it .
This is an example of the <unk> . It 's a number of <unk> .
Every big image is the beginning of a <unk> .
And it really gives you the pleasure and the <unk> experience of <unk> version of a <unk> or of a <unk> , which is for nature a <unk> <unk> .
We also did something with the <unk> of this particular number in the <unk> .
We created a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> than you use in a normal <unk> <unk> , and we have <unk> <unk> <unk> .
If you want to see the <unk> of this <unk> , you can see here .
Or even <unk> <unk> .
And this really <unk> some of these ideas to <unk> the <unk> of space on the screen .
We think this <unk> to put in the <unk> and other <unk> <unk> <unk> , not <unk> to be <unk> .
Of course , the <unk> is one of the most <unk> <unk> for this kind of technology .
And I don 't want to lose time , if we don 't say we have <unk> <unk> to give you a <unk> to <unk> in this field .
These are all the streets in the <unk> <unk> over a picture of NASA <unk> .
So let 's start to something else .
This is actually actually living on the Web ; you can see it .
This is a project called <unk> , which <unk> two different technologies .
One is <unk> and the other is a <unk> research on the very interesting <unk> made by <unk> <unk> , a student of Washington , with the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And it 's alive on the Web , <unk> .
You can <unk> when we do this kind of <unk> , where we can go from one image to the other and have this kind of experience <unk> .
But the <unk> <unk> of images here has actually a meaning .
The <unk> of the <unk> <unk> have <unk> these images together , so that we <unk> to the places that <unk> the <unk> <unk> in which the <unk> <unk> <unk> have been <unk> . Here you see some of the elements of a <unk> or <unk> , and these things are all <unk> at the <unk> .
I don 't know if I have time to show you some other environment .
There are much more <unk> .
I want to go directly to one of the <unk> of <unk> data and this <unk> from a <unk> <unk> <unk> that we 've done for the first time , to show you what we 've done is really the key behind this technology , the <unk> technology , the <unk> technology . And it 's not <unk> so much as we 're going to work in the website .
We had to <unk> <unk> and so on .
This is a <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> images <unk> . <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> and <unk> images of <unk> in <unk> , other <unk> and <unk> and <unk> images of <unk> and <unk> and so on . You know , you know , you know , this is a picture that 's <unk> to this model .
So , they 're all <unk> images from <unk> and have all <unk> <unk> at the <unk> level in this way .
And it 's possible to <unk> this <unk> way .
You know , I would never have thought about work for <unk> .
It 's very <unk> <unk> <unk> this kind of <unk> here .
I think you 'll see that this is a lot of different kinds of <unk> : from the mobile phones to the <unk> <unk> , a number , <unk> number , <unk> in this environment .
And if I can , I <unk> to look for the <unk> .
And a lot of it 's <unk> , etc .
And you have a series of photographs -- <unk> .
This is a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
We can go from the <unk> to the physics of this environment .
The <unk> is that we can do things with social environment . This is now <unk> data from <unk> by <unk> by the whole memory of how to <unk> the earth , from the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> all of the data together .
All of the picture become <unk> together , <unk> of the <unk> .
You have a model of the whole thing you <unk> .
Think of this as the <unk> of the work of <unk> <unk> on Earth .
It 's something that 's going to <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> that people <unk> it , and the <unk> that you 're going to <unk> it with the use .
Their pictures are <unk> with <unk> <unk> from other people .
If someone gets the idea of <unk> all these <unk> <unk> the name , my picture of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> all of that data <unk> , and I can use it as a <unk> to <unk> in space , using the picture of everybody else , and you can use the pictures of anybody else , and have a social experience <unk> and <unk> .
Of course , a <unk> of all the interesting <unk> of all interesting <unk> of every interesting part of the earth , <unk> not only by <unk> and <unk> and images and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> , but the memory .
Thank you very much .
Chris Anderson : I <unk> it ? What 's good ? What your software <unk> us to do is that at some point in the next few years , all the photographs that 's going to be <unk> together ?
<unk> : Yeah . What 's doing is basically <unk> .
It 's creating <unk> , if you want , between images .
And he 's <unk> it 's <unk> .
The thing becomes very interesting if you think about the <unk> information <unk> that many of these images .
As you get a <unk> <unk> and the <unk> on the Web , you <unk> a <unk> and the text on the page has a lot of information about images .
Now , what happens if you <unk> to all your picture ?
So the amount of <unk> <unk> and the amount of <unk> that <unk> is really huge . It 's a <unk> effect of the network .
CA : <unk> , it 's really <unk> .
<unk> : I 'm going to <unk> you very much .
One of the major <unk> when you <unk> and one of the <unk> research is the <unk> that it has not <unk> the <unk> <unk> , between who <unk> the past in the wind , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , between the <unk> , the <unk> <unk> of plants .
You think that <unk> <unk> <unk> still beyond the <unk> <unk> , or that the <unk> of the <unk> are still <unk> <unk> of <unk> , or <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> still the <unk> of <unk> , to <unk> the <unk> of <unk> , and that the idea of the <unk> , and that the idea of the world that we live in which is not <unk> , but it 's just a <unk> of <unk> , but it 's a <unk> of reality ,
the <unk> of a particular <unk> of <unk> choices that our <unk> has done , well , <unk> , many <unk> .
And , of course , all <unk> <unk> <unk> .
All <unk> . All <unk> <unk> .
We 're <unk> to <unk> .
We have to deal with the <unk> of death <unk> , so we didn 't know if we <unk> and <unk> --
We all have an art .
What <unk> is the <unk> of the song , the <unk> of every culture .
It doesn 't matter that matter the <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> , or the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , or the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , or the <unk> of <unk> , or a <unk> in the heart of the <unk> , or a <unk> in the heart of the <unk> .
He was my <unk> of journey in <unk> a month ago , or a <unk> of <unk> in the <unk> <unk> , on the <unk> , <unk> 's mother of the world .
All of these <unk> <unk> that there are other ways of <unk> , other ways of <unk> , other ways of moving around the world .
And if you take a moment , it 's a concept that can give you hope .
<unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> of the world create a <unk> of <unk> and <unk> that <unk> the planet is important for the <unk> of the planet as the <unk> <unk> <unk> as <unk> .
And you can think of this <unk> <unk> as a <unk> and you can <unk> the <unk> of all the <unk> , dreams , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> in being by the human imagination .
<unk> is the <unk> of humanity .
It 's the <unk> of what we 're and what we can be as as <unk> .
And <unk> <unk> was <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> , for example , <unk> that 50 percent of all the species has been or is on the <unk> of the <unk> simply because it 's <unk> , or -- in the <unk> <unk> -- and you don 't even even even even <unk> -- the <unk> of the <unk> diversity .
The <unk> of all is , of course , <unk> <unk> .
When you 're <unk> <unk> <unk> on this planet .
A language is not just <unk> by a <unk> or a series of rules .
A language is the <unk> of the human spirit .
It 's the middle that the <unk> of any culture comes in the world .
Every language is a forest of the mind , a <unk> , a thought of <unk> .
And of those <unk> <unk> , while we 're sitting here at least , at least half the <unk> is no longer <unk> in the <unk> of children .
They 're not <unk> to children , which means , unless you do something , they 're <unk> to <unk> something that they have died .
What 's most <unk> of being <unk> by the <unk> , of being the last to talk about a language , of not <unk> the <unk> of <unk> or <unk> the <unk> of <unk> or <unk> the <unk> of <unk> or <unk> ?
This <unk> has the state of someone in some part of the world every two weeks : every two weeks : every two weeks , a <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> the <unk> of a <unk> language .
And I know some of you know , " <unk> 't it be <unk> ?
The world would not be a better place if you all the same language language ? " <unk> , then we 're all <unk> . <unk> . <unk> .
<unk> <unk> .
<unk> of a <unk> thing is to say , you can 't talk about their own language .
And I 'd like to give you a journey through the <unk> --
a little journey in the <unk> for you a <unk> of what we 're <unk> .
Many of us <unk> that when I say , " different ways of <unk> , " I mean very different ways of <unk> .
So , for example this <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> , which <unk> to the <unk> <unk> from the <unk> of <unk> in the <unk> <unk> .
It 's a <unk> that it 's not able to <unk> the blue color from green because the <unk> is <unk> in the time of the forest , that we <unk> the <unk> .
They have a <unk> language and a <unk> rule , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , " <unk> <unk> " : you have to <unk> a different language .
All of this <unk> in the past <unk> , but the <unk> is that in these <unk> families where you talk to six or seven <unk> because of the <unk> <unk> anybody 's <unk> .
You start to hear and then <unk> to talk to .
<unk> one of the most interesting <unk> that I lived in , the <unk> <unk> <unk> , an incredible <unk> that has the first <unk> in <unk> .
In the <unk> five <unk> have <unk> <unk> <unk> .
They 've done by the high photographs that <unk> them in the <unk> <unk> , <unk> that this <unk> of the <unk> forest <unk> never saw anything .
They <unk> the picture from the ground , they <unk> to <unk> a form or a <unk> , and they didn 't <unk> anything , they <unk> <unk> <unk> , and they <unk> the five <unk> with <unk> .
But <unk> didn 't just <unk> the <unk> .
They <unk> between them .
<unk> percent <unk> was <unk> by their own .
We 're <unk> to eight <unk> and we found two <unk> <unk> , and we found two <unk> <unk> , they <unk> that one of them was <unk> so that he died , and then they <unk> it . They <unk> it . They <unk> it . And then they <unk> it . They <unk> it .
The <unk> were able to recognize the animal <unk> from 40 <unk> and <unk> the species .
<unk> <unk> , I was <unk> , I 've been <unk> a really interesting job when my <unk> <unk> to <unk> me if I wanted to go to <unk> between the <unk> society and <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> , and
To give a sense of <unk> , I should <unk> culture and that <unk> is not <unk> .
It 's pretty much about a <unk> <unk> <unk> of the world .
<unk> interesting .
If you ask you to <unk> the big <unk> of the world , what do you <unk> ?
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , etc . .
A continent gets <unk> out , thinking about <unk> Africa has no <unk> <unk> . And they 're <unk> and yes and the <unk> is not another that the <unk> of these <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
What makes the <unk> is the <unk> of the <unk> between life and death .
So the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> can be <unk> by the <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> to the <unk> of the alive in such a <unk> <unk> .
And this is the <unk> <unk> , " <unk> <unk> go to talk about God .
We <unk> in <unk> and <unk> God . "
And from the moment that you 're <unk> , is the spirit that <unk> you , how can you <unk> ?
So they <unk> to these amazing events : <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a rather <unk> of the power of the mind when it 's <unk> in a state of <unk> <unk> .
I 've lived all the <unk> with the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , in the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , in the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> of the <unk> civilization <unk> that once <unk> on the <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> on the <unk> <unk> .
In a <unk> continent , <unk> of blood , this <unk> never <unk> by the <unk> .
In <unk> , I 'm <unk> by a <unk> , but their education is <unk> .
<unk> <unk> are <unk> by <unk> to three or four , and they live <unk> in a world world <unk> and <unk> in <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> for 18 years .
Two <unk> <unk> years of nine years of <unk> <unk> <unk> . <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk> , <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> .
For all this time , they come <unk> to values , values that <unk> their <unk> and only their <unk> <unk> <unk> -- or to say <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And at the end of this <unk> <unk> , they <unk> out and for the first time in life , they see a <unk> . And in that moment of <unk> of the first <unk> , when the sun <unk> the <unk> of the first <unk> , when the sun <unk> <unk> , everything they have been <unk> in the <unk> , all the <unk> of the <unk> , all of what they have in the <unk> . <unk> is <unk> in the <unk> , all the <unk> of the <unk> ,
" <unk> ? <unk> as I said .
It 's <unk> . Now it 's <unk> . "
They call the <unk> and they say that we , <unk> <unk> , we are the <unk> of the world 's <unk> .
This is extremely important .
When we think of the <unk> and the <unk> environment and the <unk> <unk> and the old story of the <unk> <unk> , which is a <unk> concept in his <unk> or maybe <unk> <unk> and say that these <unk> are <unk> to us .
The <unk> <unk> are not <unk> <unk> <unk> .
There is no space for these things in the <unk> <unk> or in the <unk> of the <unk> , or in the <unk> <unk> of the Earth , they created a <unk> of Earth <unk> not about <unk> <unk> , but on a <unk> <unk> , the concept of the Earth can live only because it 's <unk> by human consciousness .
What does it mean ?
You know , a <unk> of the <unk> that <unk> is a <unk> spirit that <unk> the <unk> is a human <unk> <unk> to be a <unk> <unk> , and it will have a very different <unk> with the mountain or the place , or the <unk> of the <unk> that <unk> is a <unk> of <unk> to be <unk> .
That 's the <unk> of a spirit or a <unk> is <unk> .
What 's interesting is the <unk> that <unk> the relationship between the <unk> and the natural world .
I grew up in the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to be <unk> .
And that made me a human being different from my friends who believe that <unk> are the <unk> of <unk> and the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> and the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> and the <unk> <unk> and the <unk> <unk> that live in the <unk> <unk> .
If you try to <unk> that these <unk> can create <unk> , they start to understand some of their <unk> <unk> . We 're going to <unk> this <unk> .
I <unk> this picture at <unk> in <unk> in the <unk> <unk> .
Maybe some of you have heard about the <unk> , the most powerful <unk> of the <unk> <unk> .
What makes <unk> is not the potential of the <unk> , but his <unk> . It 's <unk> from two elements .
On one side , this <unk> <unk> <unk> a series of <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
<unk> the only <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . It <unk> a little <unk> , but it 's <unk> with the <unk> of a <unk> 's family <unk> <unk> .
This <unk> <unk> <unk> , very similar to <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
If you ever see the <unk> <unk> <unk> on the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> that they do from a different <unk> of species , <unk> it <unk> .
<unk> the <unk> of <unk> is a little bit like being <unk> by a <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> on a <unk> <unk> and <unk> on a sea of electricity . It doesn 't create a <unk> of reality ; it does not create the <unk> of reality .
<unk> with my <unk> , Richard <unk> <unk> , the man who <unk> the <unk> was <unk> , with his discovery of <unk> <unk> in the <unk> in the <unk> .
<unk> my <unk> you can 't <unk> these <unk> as <unk> because if you 're <unk> , you can 't tell anybody to be <unk> . It 's <unk> . But the <unk> can 't be <unk> because they 're <unk> by a <unk> that <unk> in the <unk> , <unk> .
It 's possible to <unk> <unk> only if you <unk> with other <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Now it 's the beautiful : <unk> that <unk> are <unk> in this <unk> are <unk> , the same <unk> . The <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . The question <unk> <unk> : in a <unk> of <unk> species , how do these <unk> <unk> two <unk> not similar , but what if you <unk> in this way , they create a <unk> version of the <unk> of the parts ?
We use the great <unk> of <unk> and <unk> , which can <unk> <unk> .
But if you <unk> , <unk> , we <unk> , " <unk> <unk> , "
What does it mean ?
This <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , which <unk> <unk> in the forest , and that <unk> in our eyes in the same species .
If you <unk> how do they <unk> their <unk> , " <unk> <unk> of the <unk> , of the rest of them , you don 't know everything ? " I said , " No . "
The solution is : they take the <unk> in a night <unk> and <unk> with a different <unk> .
And we didn 't <unk> to <unk> , but it 's much more interesting than <unk> <unk> .
Now , it 's the problem that 's also the ones of us that have <unk> <unk> them , but in some way to the <unk> of history than the real world , and it 's <unk> .
In fact , the <unk> century , in 300 years , not <unk> <unk> for his <unk> or his <unk> <unk> , but rather as the <unk> was that we <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> or <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> of diversity and <unk> and <unk> on the planet . Now , the problem is not the change .
All the <unk> through the <unk> have been <unk> in a <unk> for new possibilities .
And the problem is not technology .
<unk> <unk> didn 't have <unk> to be <unk> when they put <unk> and <unk> and <unk> as the <unk> didn 't have <unk> to be <unk> when they put <unk> and <unk> .
It 's not the change or technology that <unk> the <unk> of <unk> . It 's power .
The <unk> <unk> .
And if you look at the world , you know , you know , you 're not <unk> to <unk> .
They 're <unk> creatures and <unk> <unk> out of the existence of <unk> forces that go beyond their ability to <unk> .
<unk> that <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> --
a <unk> <unk> <unk> , in the <unk> , <unk> , a <unk> that has lived in the forest to a generation ago , and now <unk> to the <unk> and the <unk> on the <unk> of the <unk> , where you can see the <unk> <unk> from the <unk> that seems to <unk> the <unk> <unk> , where the <unk> <unk> <unk> , where the <unk> <unk> <unk> ,
We started <unk> <unk> with the <unk> <unk> to the forest .
Or in the case of <unk> , it 's the <unk> <unk> .
If we <unk> on the <unk> of the <unk> , where I 'm doing a lot of research , you 'll see the <unk> of politics .
As the <unk> , <unk> physics of a <unk> , is <unk> <unk> , it 's <unk> at the <unk> level , but the <unk> , the <unk> of a <unk> , not only is <unk> , but <unk> in certain <unk> , because it 's part of the development .
And you can 't understand the <unk> of the <unk> until you go from the beginning .
I <unk> miles from <unk> in China from <unk> in the <unk> <unk> , <unk> to <unk> with a young <unk> , but only <unk> <unk> , I realized what the <unk> behind .
<unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> million people <unk> from the <unk> during the <unk> <unk> .
The father of this guy was <unk> at <unk> <unk> .
And the one of the <unk> of the Chinese <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
My mother was <unk> and her <unk> was being <unk> .
It was taken of <unk> in <unk> at age two <unk> <unk> his <unk> because he couldn 't live without him .
The <unk> , who did the same , was <unk> in <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> a <unk> <unk> , and for this <unk> , was <unk> to the <unk> work for seven years .
The <unk> of the <unk> can be <unk> , but the spirit of the <unk> is from <unk> present .
<unk> , all <unk> to a choice .
What we 're going to live in the <unk> world , or we want to <unk> the world of diversity of the <unk> world ?
The great <unk> <unk> <unk> , before he died said that his greatest fear was that , in our <unk> to go to this <unk> <unk> vision of the world 's imagination , not only <unk> the whole <unk> of the human imagination to a <unk> <unk> of thinking , but a day we <unk> us from a <unk> <unk> <unk> that there were other possibilities .
And it 's <unk> to remember that our species is <unk> for <unk> years .
The <unk> <unk> , who gave us agriculture , which has <unk> us to <unk> <unk> , <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> with the <unk> of <unk> , creating the <unk> of <unk> , creating the <unk> of <unk> , <unk> , and we talk about <unk> years ago .
The <unk> world has <unk> <unk> 300 years .
That <unk> story not to me that we have answers to all the challenges that we 're going to <unk> in <unk> .
When these <unk> <unk> of the world is asked what it means to be human , <unk> with <unk> <unk> .
And it 's in these answers that we all <unk> the possibility of being what we are : a kind of <unk> , which has to <unk> , all the <unk> can <unk> . And there are big moments of <unk> .
I <unk> this picture on the north of the island of <unk> , when I went to <unk> with <unk> , and this man , <unk> , <unk> me the wonderful story of his <unk> .
The <unk> government wasn 't always <unk> with the <unk> <unk> and in the <unk> for <unk> , and in the <unk> for our <unk> , we <unk> them in <unk> .
The <unk> of this man <unk> <unk> .
The family , <unk> for his life , <unk> the <unk> <unk> , and all his <unk> .
You know , you know , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> of the <unk> were made of <unk> fish in <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> of this man didn 't <unk> from the night or <unk> <unk> .
It 's <unk> <unk> , they <unk> the <unk> in skin <unk> and <unk> in your hand . When I did it <unk> , he <unk> it , he <unk> it , he <unk> it .
He <unk> on the <unk> of this <unk> <unk> and when <unk> <unk> , he <unk> a dog .
He <unk> the dog and created a <unk> , with the <unk> <unk> created a <unk> , <unk> <unk> a <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> to talk to anything ? [ <unk> ] ] . And this one , in different ways , [ <unk> ] is the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> and all the <unk> <unk> of the world 's <unk> .
<unk> <unk> the <unk> government <unk> <unk> to the <unk> control of an area of a larger <unk> of California and <unk> <unk> together .
It 's their new <unk> . It 's called <unk> .
It 's a <unk> <unk> . We all <unk> resources .
One <unk> of how a <unk> can <unk> with his <unk> .
And , to end , I think it 's pretty <unk> at least to the <unk> of us has been in these <unk> <unk> of the planet , that are not not at all .
For someone 's home is .
<unk> of the human imagination that <unk> to <unk> . And for us all , the dreams of these children , like the dreams of our children , become part of the <unk> of hope .
<unk> , we <unk> <unk> we are <unk> that <unk> never <unk> to anything .
I <unk> that <unk> --
<unk> are not <unk> , but we believe that stories can change the world , and maybe we are the best <unk> to tell the stories of the world . Every month our site <unk> <unk> million <unk> .
<unk> <unk> our <unk> <unk> .
Our <unk> are <unk> from millions of people .
Our work is <unk> in <unk> to bring our audience to <unk> our audience in places that we have <unk> from how they <unk> from how they saw and , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , the <unk> world of <unk> : the <unk> world of <unk> in diversity , and we have to find a <unk> <unk> in a <unk> world . And <unk> <unk> . And we have to find a <unk> world 's <unk> and <unk>
where the <unk> of all <unk> can <unk> to our <unk> <unk> .
Thank you .
I 'm going to talk about some of the things I 've written in this book that I hope you 've heard and <unk> to <unk> some <unk> , in the case you don 't <unk> them .
I 'd like to start with what I call the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> of what ?
The <unk> of all <unk> society <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> : " If we want to <unk> the <unk> of our citizens , " The way to do it is <unk> freedom <unk> <unk> . "
The reason is , on the one side , in fact that freedom is <unk> itself , it 's <unk> , it 's <unk> , <unk> for human beings .
<unk> is the other one is in fact that if we 're <unk> , each of us can act to <unk> everything that <unk> our <unk> , without anybody who <unk> in our own .
The way to <unk> the freedom is to <unk> .
<unk> people have , more <unk> , they 're <unk> , and the <unk> is the <unk> , the <unk> is the <unk> , the <unk> is their <unk> .
This , <unk> , it 's so <unk> <unk> in the society that nobody <unk> <unk> in <unk> .
And it 's also <unk> <unk> in our lives .
I 'm going to show you some examples of what progress has made possible .
This is my <unk> . It 's not particularly big .
I <unk> a simple <unk> <unk> for <unk> .
In my <unk> , there are <unk> <unk> , without <unk> the 10 <unk> of <unk> <unk> and the 12 <unk> <unk> that you can buy for you a huge number of <unk> in the <unk> <unk> that nobody of <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> that nobody <unk> <unk> is <unk> in your <unk> .
This is what <unk> is .
Then you go to the <unk> store for a <unk> : <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
And in this single <unk> store , there 's a great number of <unk> <unk> .
We can do six and a half million different <unk> using the <unk> that there are in one store .
<unk> <unk> that there is <unk> .
<unk> <unk> : the world of <unk> .
Once , I was a baby , you could get all the services <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> that they were <unk> by <unk> <unk> .
You <unk> the phone , you didn 't <unk> it .
And a <unk> of that , between the other , was not <unk> .
These days , they went .
We have now a <unk> <unk> of <unk> , especially in the mobile phones .
Here 's the <unk> of the future .
My <unk> is the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> of the <unk> , and <unk> for <unk> <unk> .
If you haven 't seen it in the <unk> store in the <unk> , you 're very well <unk> .
And what 's the end of the end is that people <unk> and <unk> this question . And you know , what the answer is , " No . "
It 's not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn 't face <unk> .
So , in other <unk> of life that are much more important than <unk> , <unk> the same <unk> of choices .
<unk> <unk> : <unk> , not happens to the United States you <unk> from the <unk> and the <unk> <unk> you what you have to do .
Instead , <unk> from the <unk> , and the <unk> says , " OK , can do it , or <unk> , " <unk> , can do it , " or <unk> " <unk> , " <unk> have these <unk> and these <unk> . What do you want to do ? "
You <unk> him , " <unk> , what do you want to do ? "
And the <unk> says , " <unk> these <unk> , and <unk> has these <unk> , and <unk> has these <unk> and <unk> these <unk> . "
" What do you want to do ? "
And you say , " <unk> if she was me , what would you say ? "
And the <unk> : " But I 'm not her . "
The result of the <unk> <unk> , " <unk> <unk> , " <unk> " <unk> " <unk> " <unk> " <unk> " <unk> " <unk> " . "
But actually it 's not a <unk> and <unk> of <unk> to make decisions from someone who knows something , <unk> the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , and not know anything -- and almost certainly it 's <unk> -- and it 's not <unk> to make the patient 's patient .
There 's a huge <unk> of <unk> products , <unk> to people like me and you , that if you think of it doesn 't make sense , because you can 't <unk> .
But if we can 't <unk> , why do we <unk> them ?
The answer is they want to <unk> to <unk> the <unk> to <unk> the <unk> .
And the <unk> of the fundamental <unk> , as we see in this <unk> . " It 's not about <unk> kids . We don 't want to <unk> kids . <unk> their sex at the right time . " We don 't <unk> a <unk> : we have to <unk> it .
And we can <unk> how many times we <unk> us .
And that means that any <unk> , <unk> , you have to decide that kind of person you want to be .
<unk> to the family and <unk> , a time perspective , <unk> almost to anybody , it was that you <unk> the <unk> as soon as possible , and you <unk> to <unk> the <unk> as soon as possible .
The only real choice was with who , not when and even what to do after .
<unk> , it 's really <unk> to play .
<unk> to very smart students , and they <unk> them to <unk> 20 percent of the time .
And not because they 're not <unk> , because they 're not <unk> .
But why am I <unk> , I 'm <unk> , I 'm going to <unk> , " <unk> <unk> or not ? "
" <unk> <unk> <unk> later ? I have to think about <unk> or <unk> ? "
They 're <unk> <unk> .
And they try to answer these questions , even if this <unk> doesn 't <unk> the <unk> that you can 't get the <unk> that you can 't get a beautiful <unk> to my <unk> .
And they have to do that . They 're important questions .
Now , the work : we 're <unk> , like <unk> <unk> , because the technology <unk> us to work every minute , every day , from every day , <unk> of the planet , <unk> <unk> .
<unk> , there 's a <unk> , and I won 't tell anybody what , where the <unk> works .
I don 't tell you , because I want to use it .
What does this <unk> for choice that we have about work ? It 's that we have to decide , <unk> at any time , if we have to work or not .
We can go to our son to <unk> , with the mobile phone in a <unk> , the <unk> in the other , and the <unk> , <unk> .
And even if they 're all <unk> , every minute we see the <unk> , we 're also <unk> , " I have to answer this call ? "
" I have to <unk> this <unk> ? "
And even when the answer is , " no , that makes the experience of the <unk> of your son very different from what it would be in other conditions .
So , from any <unk> , you look , things , little and big things , and <unk> and <unk> , life is a matter of choices .
And one time the world was this : <unk> , there were some possibilities , but it wasn 't all about choice .
The world of today <unk> to this : The <unk> is , " Is it a <unk> thing , or <unk> ? "
The answer is <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> we all know , so I 'm going to talk about the <unk> .
We <unk> this choice <unk> two effects effects of people .
The first one , <unk> , is that it <unk> instead of <unk> .
And so many <unk> between the <unk> , it becomes very difficult to do .
I 'll give you an example <unk> : a study <unk> <unk> .
A <unk> of my <unk> has been <unk> to the <unk> <unk> , with about a million <unk> in <unk> , with about a million <unk> in <unk> .
And what she discovered is that for every 10 solutions that are <unk> in more , the <unk> of <unk> two percent .
With 50 <unk> <unk> , there 's 10 percent in less than <unk> than <unk> when they 're available to them . Why ?
Because with 50 <unk> <unk> between the <unk> that you have , it 's <unk> to decide , and the choice is <unk> to <unk> .
And in <unk> , and still <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and of course <unk> never <unk> .
<unk> that doesn 't mean only means that these <unk> <unk> food to <unk> because they have not enough money , it also wants to say that the decision is so <unk> that we <unk> the <unk> <unk> of work .
They 're not <unk> , they 're <unk> to <unk> <unk> for <unk> year from the <unk> of work , which would be <unk> <unk> .
So the <unk> is a <unk> of <unk> .
And I think we <unk> the world like this .
" And to end up , to the <unk> : <unk> , <unk> or <unk> ? "
You just have to take the right decision , if it 's for <unk> , isn 't it ?
You don 't want to pick the <unk> wrong , and <unk> the wrong wrong .
So this is the first effect . The second is that if we can <unk> the <unk> and make a choice , at the end of how we have to <unk> <unk> with less than <unk> between which which to choose .
And this for several reasons .
One of these is that with many <unk> between which <unk> , if you <unk> one and it 's not perfect , it 's easy to imagine that it would be better . And what happens is that the <unk> <unk> <unk> us to <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> <unk> from <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> <unk> from <unk> ,
And even when it was a <unk> decision .
<unk> , there are more <unk> , it 's <unk> than any <unk> that it 's <unk> of <unk> choice .
<unk> , there is what <unk> call .
Dan <unk> has <unk> very well as the value that we give things to the <unk> things from what <unk> .
<unk> , when there are many <unk> possible , it 's easy to <unk> the <unk> of <unk> <unk> and be less <unk> than <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> , and be less <unk> of <unk> .
Here 's an example . I 'm <unk> with all the <unk> that I 'm not in New York .
But that 's probably <unk> .
There 's this <unk> <unk> .
A <unk> of <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> . <unk> day . It 's all about them .
They 're not going to <unk> anything . But what he thinks is , " Well , <unk> , it 's <unk> . "
" All my <unk> <unk> are <unk> . "
" <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . "
And it <unk> two weeks from the idea that 's <unk> -- every day -- the <unk> of <unk> where you want .
The <unk> <unk> for what we have , even when the choice was <unk> .
And the <unk> are <unk> that we have from <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> against how we <unk> .
Here 's another example .
This <unk> us a lot of things .
It 's about the moment , and maybe of living in slowly .
But the most important thing is that anything you <unk> , you <unk> to not do other .
The things that don 't <unk> have many <unk> that can make less <unk> what we do .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> <unk> .
I tried it on my skin <unk> a new couple of <unk> .
<unk> always <unk> .
And once the <unk> were only one guy , <unk> them and <unk> by <unk> , they were <unk> , only after <unk> a life and <unk> a lot of times , <unk> to go well .
So , I went to <unk> a new when the <unk> went , and I said , " I need a couple of <unk> , this is my <unk> . "
The <unk> said , " <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> ? "
<unk> wants to <unk> or <unk> ? " <unk> " or <unk> " or <unk> " ? "
" <unk> <unk> ? "
" <unk> <unk> <unk> or <unk> ? <unk> <unk> <unk> -- " <unk> <unk> . "
I was <unk> , and after a little <unk> , I was able to say , " I want the guy -- that was the only guy , " I want the only guy , " I 'd <unk> <unk> , and then <unk> from the <unk> , <unk> by the <unk> , <unk> from the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> by the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , with the <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> from the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> ,
It was the <unk> . With all that choice , I had <unk> the best .
But I 'm going to <unk> .
Why ? I wrote a whole book for <unk> .
The reason I was worse is that with all the choice of my <unk> were <unk> , the <unk> <unk> to be <unk> .
I had <unk> <unk> . I didn 't <unk> anything <unk> when I was just a guy , but when I just <unk> 100 , <unk> , at least one guy had to be perfect .
And I had <unk> was good , but not perfect .
After <unk> , I <unk> the <unk> with what I was <unk> in <unk> .
The <unk> of <unk> in the life of people don 't do <unk> that these <unk> have respect to the <unk> of the same <unk> .
And this <unk> <unk> , even when the results are good .
<unk> in the world of the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Because if you <unk> it , I don 't know what I 'm talking about .
The truth <unk> to this .
And he said , " Well , he was better , " The reason he was <unk> when he was worse , it was even even even <unk> of the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> , in the world we live in -- <unk> , <unk> citizens with the <unk> of <unk> -- the <unk> that we can <unk> is that things are at the <unk> of <unk> .
You 've never never <unk> <unk> because your <unk> , my <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
The <unk> of happiness -- what you 're here -- is , " <unk> <unk> <unk> , " Yes , " <unk> <unk> <unk> . " Yes , you want . "
I mean -- little <unk> moment -- who I 'm really <unk> and my wife is really <unk> .
I couldn 't do better , I didn 't <unk> .
But <unk> not always it 's a <unk> thing .
<unk> , a <unk> of buy a couple of <unk> <unk> when there is only that kind of <unk> is that when you 're not <unk> , and you say , " Why ? "
" Who is <unk> ? " <unk> , " <unk> is <unk> . "
The world is <unk> . What can I do you ?
When you have hundreds of <unk> , and you get a <unk> , and you <unk> a <unk> , and you <unk> the <unk> is <unk> that the <unk> you are you .
We could have better <unk> .
With hundreds of <unk> available , there are not <unk> for <unk> .
So when people make decisions , even if the result is <unk> , they <unk> and they <unk> their <unk> to them themselves .
In the last few years , the <unk> is <unk> in the <unk> world .
I think a <unk> <unk> -- not the only , but important -- of this <unk> of <unk> is that people have <unk> experiences because the <unk> are too <unk> .
And when they have to <unk> this situation they think <unk> is .
So the final result is that we 're better , <unk> , but we 're going to <unk> it .
You 'll <unk> you .
This is the <unk> <unk> , what we all take for good and it 's completely <unk> . It 's not true .
There 's no <unk> that a little bit of choice is better than <unk> at all , but it 's not <unk> that much choice is better than a little bit .
There 's a <unk> value , <unk> . I don 't know what it is .
But I 'm sure we 've <unk> from a piece of the level where the choices <unk> our life .
Now , from the <unk> <unk> -- I 've been <unk> -- from the <unk> of view , the <unk> is the <unk> .
And that allows all this choice in the <unk> society is the <unk> material .
There are many places in the world , and you know , <unk> <unk> , where the problem is not that they have <unk> choice .
The problem is they have too <unk> .
So the <unk> I 'm talking about is a <unk> <unk> of <unk> , <unk> society .
And what <unk> does , and <unk> is this : <unk> <unk> <unk> you talked about how the <unk> and <unk> <unk> to <unk> them to be <unk> . It 's a <unk> of money .
I mean , these choices , <unk> and <unk> , it 's not that just <unk> .
They 're <unk> <unk> .
They do worse .
If a little bit of what in our society allows to be <unk> choice was <unk> in the <unk> in the way , it would not be the life to <unk> , but it also our <unk> .
This is what <unk> call a <unk> <unk> .
A <unk> of income does well -- not only the poor people -- because of this choice in <unk> that <unk> us .
So , I 'll end up , " <unk> , you can become everything you want to be --
<unk> , people of culture , <unk> : " What do you know ? "
" It 's <unk> that you can 't <unk> in a glass <unk> . "
" A <unk> imagination , a <unk> view of the world --
And I <unk> it up and I <unk> it up like this .
But then , <unk> , I realized that that fish knows the long one knows .
Because the reality is that if you <unk> the <unk> , you know , you can 't <unk> the <unk> , you can 't <unk> the freedom . You <unk> the <unk> .
If you <unk> the <unk> in a way that you can <unk> the <unk> .
<unk> the <unk> , and <unk> <unk> .
They all need a <unk> .
This is almost certainly too <unk> , maybe even for the fish , and certainly for us .
But the <unk> of some <unk> <unk> is a <unk> for <unk> and , <unk> , for <unk> .
Thank you very much .
