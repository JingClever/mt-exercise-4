<unk> year , I showed these <unk> for <unk> that the <unk> <unk> <unk> , which for almost three million years had the size of the United States <unk> , <unk> , <unk> percent of the United States .
And this <unk> <unk> the <unk> of the problem because it 's not <unk> the ice <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> is , in a sense , the heart of climate system .
It 's <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
The next <unk> is going to be a <unk> <unk> on the <unk> of the last 25 years .
<unk> <unk> are <unk> in red .
And you can see , you 're <unk> to the blue <unk> .
That 's the ice in <unk> , which is <unk> in summer .
You can see that the <unk> ice <unk> , of five years or more , is like blood , which here <unk> from the body .
<unk> years , it 's <unk> for that .
This is a problem because the <unk> <unk> <unk> around the ocean <unk> around the ocean <unk> where there are <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , are <unk> in <unk> .
<unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> global <unk> , that <unk> <unk> , <unk> this point of not <unk> .
In some <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> the <unk> is already <unk> by the water .
<unk> <unk> <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> ! <unk> : She 's good . The question is if you 're going to be <unk> .
One is that this <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> from the North <unk> .
This is a <unk> river <unk> .
<unk> had never <unk> <unk> levels .
This is the <unk> river , in the <unk> of <unk> .
If you want to know how the <unk> level of the sea <unk> <unk> on <unk> , here is where the sea .
These <unk> are <unk> <unk> .
<unk> other side of the planet : <unk> , the largest <unk> ice of the planet planet .
The month , the <unk> scientists who <unk> the ice <unk> is in <unk> , and that the <unk> <unk> , which <unk> on some <unk> <unk> , is particularly <unk> in the <unk> .
<unk> at six feet of the <unk> level , like <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , the third largest <unk> of ice , you see new <unk> , which a few years ago .
<unk> percent of the world population <unk> half of the water from that <unk> .
<unk> <unk> : this is the source of the water <unk> of this city .
<unk> is <unk> .
But when you get it , the same happens to the water .
In California , <unk> on the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> percent .
<unk> <unk> are in crisis .
<unk> , like you read , they 're <unk> .
<unk> <unk> in the world , to a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> are <unk> <unk> to a <unk> out of the normal and without <unk> .
<unk> times <unk> in the last 30 years of the <unk> <unk> .
This is a <unk> of all <unk> .
If you look in the context <unk> if you can see the <unk> .
In the last five years , we 've <unk> 70 million <unk> of CO2 every day .
Look at the <unk> <unk> <unk> , from the <unk> , <unk> , and on both parts of the <unk> <unk> , where there is a <unk> <unk> of oxygen in the oceans .
The <unk> of global warming , together to <unk> , which is 20 percent , is the use of <unk> .
The oil is a problem , and the <unk> is even worse .
The United States is one of the two countries with the <unk> , together .
And it 's <unk> to build a lot of other <unk> .
But we 're <unk> to a <unk> of the direction .
These are the <unk> projects in the last and some <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
And then , there 's a political political <unk> in our country .
The <unk> of the <unk> and oil <unk> <unk> million dollars in the last year to <unk> <unk> <unk> , which is a <unk> .
I 'm going to <unk> this --
<unk> <unk> , in the <unk> , where I live , there was a <unk> of <unk> billion <unk> of <unk> .
Maybe you saw it on the <unk> .
This is the second largest flow of <unk> in America .
It 's happened around <unk> .
<unk> <unk> of one of the <unk> <unk> was this .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> <unk> is a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
It 's <unk> here in America , and it does our economy .
<unk> the <unk> is more <unk> .
It 's <unk> , <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> here is a lot of the <unk> <unk> .
The largest society <unk> <unk> is <unk> <unk> . This is <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> <unk> : <unk> <unk> <unk> -- Al <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> -- they don 't know what they 're talking about .
<unk> : So the <unk> for the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> has two <unk> .
This is one of them , a part of them .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> : <unk> <unk> we see the <unk> changes like a <unk> <unk> to our business .
And this is <unk> a great amount of money in a <unk> <unk> to make public and <unk> the truth of the <unk> .
In fact , the <unk> is not <unk> .
We think it 's <unk> -- it 's also a good <unk> .
So , we don 't know about climate change .
We need to do it .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> <unk> -- you 've heard about a lot .
So we <unk> a <unk> structure in a <unk> structure of the <unk> .
<unk> ! The machines are a little bit <unk> , but this is the sound of <unk> <unk> .
<unk> of <unk> is in the main <unk> of global <unk> , but the technology of <unk> <unk> that you can see everything .
Let 's look at a look . This is the <unk> technology .
<unk> : <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to the economic question and the national security .
<unk> : <unk> is : America is in the crisis ; the economy , security crisis , the crisis .
The <unk> that <unk> all : our <unk> <unk> <unk> , like <unk> <unk> <unk> , like <unk> <unk> and oil .
Now , but , there 's a new , <unk> solution for <unk> .
<unk> America : 100 percent of <unk> energy , in 10 years .
A plan for <unk> America to work , more <unk> , and to help us <unk> global .
<unk> , a solution that we <unk> to solve our problems .
<unk> America . <unk> of more .
<unk> : This is the last .
<unk> : <unk> is : <unk> <unk> of energy to America .
One of the most <unk> ways of <unk> <unk> <unk> from the <unk> that we <unk> our planet planet .
<unk> : The future is here . <unk> , <unk> , a new network network .
<unk> <unk> two : <unk> <unk> for <unk> jobs .
<unk> : <unk> America . It 's time to be <unk> .
<unk> : A old <unk> <unk> says , " If you want to go from the only one .
If you want to go away , you go together . "
We have to go away , quickly .
Thank you very much .
<unk> year , I did a <unk> <unk> on the <unk> .
And I 'm going to <unk> to <unk> on how the machine works .
So it 's <unk> . And for the those other time , there were no <unk> , the <unk> is the largest <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> is <unk> the <unk> of <unk> the conditions that were <unk> in a second of the universe -- until <unk> million times a second .
All this is just <unk> .
This is the machine under <unk> .
We have these <unk> <unk> in the <unk> .
This is what I work . It 's called <unk> -- it 's <unk> feet and it has a <unk> of <unk> feet .
This is a <unk> image of <unk> in building so you can see the <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> of last year we <unk> the machine for the first time .
And this picture was <unk> by <unk> .
It was <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> .
It 's an image of the first <unk> of particles that had all been done the <unk> of <unk> , <unk> , with a part of the <unk> , and <unk> particles inside the <unk> .
In other words , when you <unk> this image of the 10 <unk> , <unk> that 's a great <unk> .
I don 't know if it was this <unk> to do more or this , when someone <unk> on Google and <unk> that the page was this .
What means we had a <unk> impact beyond that scientific impact .
And a week later , there was a problem with the car , we had to the car here -- these <unk> <unk> .
These <unk> <unk> <unk> when the machine works at the <unk> of the <unk> .
Now , the <unk> between you <unk> and <unk> , " It 's not true . I 'm too <unk> . "
And instead can do this because when they 're very <unk> <unk> <unk> .
So , at least <unk> degrees <unk> degrees , at a temperature <unk> to the space between stars , these <unk> can bring that <unk> .
In one of the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> in the <unk> , there was a <unk> of <unk> .
So the <unk> <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
This was the result .
Now , this is still more <unk> if you think that these <unk> <unk> more than 20 <unk> , and that 's <unk> about 30 <unk> .
They 're <unk> about 50 <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , what we did .
We <unk> them and <unk> .
Now , they 're all <unk> to their <unk> place .
<unk> the end of <unk> <unk> is going to be new <unk> .
<unk> , and we <unk> to get data in <unk> or <unk> , and we 'll continue to <unk> to find what the <unk> <unk> to find out what the universe is .
Now , of course , in a way , these <unk> <unk> the <unk> of science and engineering of <unk> . It 's easy to <unk> .
I think the fact that it 's so hard , the fact that it 's going to go beyond the <unk> , I think is the value of things like <unk> .
I 'd like to end the words of a <unk> <unk> , <unk> , which , <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> experiments of <unk> experiments of his <unk> , his <unk> was Michael <unk> , he said , " No is so <unk> for the progress of human mind as the ideas that the ideas of human mind , the ideas of science are not <unk> , <unk> , our <unk> , <unk> , <unk> are <unk> of <unk> ,
Thank you .
I want to start <unk> to <unk> <unk> , when children , <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> as <unk> and <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , actually to think and solve problems <unk> and <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> is <unk> to the way that <unk> <unk> in the world .
So , from <unk> <unk> <unk> of our <unk> with <unk> <unk> , and I was <unk> <unk> , and my <unk> <unk> <unk> , and I started to <unk> , and I started to <unk> , " And if we use a computer , instead of having the computer , instead of <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
and <unk> to our <unk> ?
The question was so interesting that we <unk> to explore the answer , building <unk> .
In a few words , a <unk> is a great computer <unk> .
In a few words , a <unk> is a great computer <unk> .
You can <unk> them with the hand , they can be <unk> with their own , and they have a <unk> and a <unk> <unk> .
But <unk> , they 're <unk> , like <unk> , you can just <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> are the example of a new <unk> of tools for <unk> information information .
And as as as as a <unk> , <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> movement , and they become more <unk> , <unk> of the other , of the other , of the other , of the other , like <unk> , we can explore and <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
We 're going to <unk> with some simple example .
This is <unk> <unk> to show you video : if you put it in a direction , video video <unk> so , if you get on the other <unk> .
These <unk> <unk> are <unk> of the other .
If you <unk> them , you know what they 're going to do .
If they 're <unk> , they <unk> and they can <unk> a little bit .
If they 're <unk> , they <unk> and they can <unk> a little bit .
They also <unk> their movement and <unk> .
We <unk> that one of the interesting <unk> of the <unk> was the <unk> of the data , to the <unk> of data , to the color of the color of the color as if it was a <unk> .
In this case , we have three <unk> <unk> <unk> as a <unk> of <unk> and <unk> to <unk> of the color of the color , where it 's <unk> .
And I can <unk> to <unk> the color of the central color , where you 're <unk> .
If you 're too much , we can <unk> a little bit at place .
I 'm also <unk> to be <unk> , like <unk> , <unk> , math and games where people are <unk> and <unk> things that are going to try to do things quickly , and they immediately immediately .
Now , I 'm --
This is a <unk> <unk> <unk> that I do with a <unk> program .
We have a <unk> game of words that 's <unk> between <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> , at every <unk> <unk> a letter to the <unk> a letter , <unk> , to every <unk> <unk> a letter on every <unk> , and while I <unk> <unk> , and while I was <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And then , after about 30 seconds , and you have a new <unk> of <unk> and new chance to try .
Thank you .
And here 's the children <unk> in <unk> <unk> <unk> , I did a way that <unk> them and I <unk> a video .
They 're very <unk> .
And one of the interesting things of this kind of <unk> is that you don 't have to give people a lot of <unk> .
I just say , " <unk> of words , " and they know exactly what to do .
Here 's here , you know ,
This is our <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , there 's the right .
It wanted to be <unk> .
They were just <unk> , for him .
Now , this is a <unk> of a <unk> <unk> .
<unk> to build a tool for the <unk> of the <unk> .
It can <unk> new characters in the <unk> , <unk> their <unk> .
It can <unk> new characters in the <unk> , <unk> their <unk> .
And that 's doing it 's doing the sun .
<unk> : The sun is <unk> .
David <unk> : Now , he has <unk> a <unk> in the scene .
<unk> : The <unk> <unk> .
<unk> !
So , we <unk> the <unk> and <unk> can <unk> the characters --
<unk> : <unk> !
<unk> its story .
<unk> : <unk> !
<unk> : It 's a <unk> story with open open , and it can decide him as a <unk> .
<unk> : It 's a <unk> story with open open , and it can decide him as a <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> .
<unk> : The last example I 've got the time to show you is a tool , <unk> <unk> , for <unk> and <unk> music .
It 's a tool , made of <unk> , <unk> and <unk> music .
The <unk> here <unk> <unk> <unk> as the base , the <unk> .
<unk> of these has four different <unk> , and you can choose what to use .
You can also <unk> these <unk> in a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And they just <unk> it <unk> a <unk> , " and a <unk> . "
These are actually <unk> that you can control out of the live , like the <unk> and <unk> .
It 's <unk> to a particular sound and then they <unk> for <unk> .
And then there are the <unk> <unk> as long and <unk> , which is <unk> to the whole sequence .
It 's <unk> how it works .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> a <unk> in two <unk> <unk> , " <unk> a <unk> <unk> , the <unk> in a series , the other <unk> .
Now , you 're going to go to the bottom .
<unk> : <unk> . Now <unk> <unk> <unk> --
<unk> : <unk> : And now I <unk> the <unk> to the <unk> , so I can control the effect of the live live .
<unk> : <unk> : I can <unk> the whole <unk> <unk> the time from one side or another .
<unk> : <unk> : And now we <unk> the <unk> to give more <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> : I can <unk> the <unk> .
So I don 't have to <unk> before , but I can <unk> , <unk> , more <unk> or more <unk> .
And now , finally , I can <unk> the whole <unk> <unk> on the left left the <unk> <unk> .
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is to build new <unk> <unk> more <unk> to how our brain work and body .
And today , I had a time to show you one of the results of this <unk> , and also some chance that we try to get out of the lab .
And the concept I want to <unk> is that <unk> this new generation of objects to <unk> with the average <unk> , which information information in our world world , that we want .
Thank you very much .
I don 't see the now of you .
I 'm a <unk> .
<unk> books is my <unk> , but it 's more than this , of course .
It 's also love and the <unk> of my life .
And I don 't know what it can change .
But , said , this , something particular is happened in my life and my career , who <unk> me to <unk> the whole relationship with this work .
The particular thing is that I wrote this book , this <unk> called " <unk> , " <unk> , " which , " <unk> , " which , " which , " <unk> , " which , " <unk> , " which is a great , <unk> .
And the result is that everywhere now , people <unk> me as if I was <unk> .
<unk> -- <unk> , <unk> !
<unk> from me now , all <unk> and say , " You don 't know , you know , you don 't have more to do better ?
You don 't know , you 're not going to write for all life without more <unk> to create a book that can <unk> to somebody ? "
that can you get to somebody ? "
It 's <unk> , you know .
But it may go worse , and I remember that more than 20 years ago , when I was <unk> to say , I was a <unk> -- I was a <unk> -- I was a <unk> -- I wanted to be a <unk> .
I 'm going to <unk> the same <unk> <unk> .
And people say , " Don 't <unk> to be <unk> ?
You don 't know that the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> ?
You don 't 're going to do this <unk> for all life without anything is going to ever out and die on a <unk> of <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> ? "
And so , you know .
The answer -- the short answer to all these questions is , " You know . "
And I fear of all those things .
I always had fear .
And I 'm <unk> of a lot of other things that people would not be <unk> .
As the <unk> and other things .
But , how do you know , I thought , and I was <unk> <unk> is why ?
Is it <unk> ?
It 's <unk> that anyone who <unk> <unk> to be <unk> by a job that you feel born to do .
But what is this particular <unk> in the <unk> <unk> <unk> about the health <unk> <unk> in a way that other <unk> <unk> ?
How I was my father , for example , he was a <unk> <unk> and I didn 't remember one time in his <unk> of activity where the <unk> were asked to be <unk> ?
It was never -- that <unk> of the <unk> John , how do you go ?
<unk> 't you know , <unk> ?
<unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> as a group of course , in the <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> to be <unk> <unk> .
We <unk> , we have enough this <unk> , and not only <unk> , but we <unk> of every kind of <unk> of all , we have this <unk> to be <unk> <unk> .
And I don 't know , I 'm going to look at the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> that , only in the <unk> century , <unk> , <unk> and often <unk> for them .
And also the ones that don 't seem to be <unk> by their <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , before I was going to die , before the <unk> said , " Every book , I was a little more <unk> about work about the work of your life .
But we don 't <unk> <unk> when we say , because we heard these things so much at the long <unk> that in some way we have completely <unk> and <unk> the <unk> that creativity and <unk> are in some way that art , at the end , <unk> always to <unk> .
And the question I want to <unk> to all here is , you 're going to do this with this idea ?
And it 's good about this thing -- because it also <unk> from a <unk> <unk> <unk> to me not well for this <unk> .
I think it 's <unk> .
And I think it 's also <unk> and I don 't want to <unk> in the next century .
I think it 's better <unk> our big <unk> to live .
And I know , in my case -- it would be a very <unk> to start to <unk> to that <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> in which I 'm in my career .
<unk> -- you look at , I 'm pretty young , I was about 40 years .
I still about four <unk> of work in me .
And it 's very <unk> that any <unk> of the <unk> now , it 's going to be <unk> by the world as the work that I <unk> after the <unk> of my last book .
<unk> <unk> , because we 're all more or less friends here -- is <unk> that my largest success is to my <unk> .
Oh , <unk> , who thought !
You know this is the kind of thinking that brings a person to start <unk> to the nine of the morning and I don 't want to do it .
I 'll continue to go to do this work that I love .
So , the question becomes , how ?
And so , it seems to me , after a lot of <unk> , which the way to work to write is to write <unk> , OK ?
I have to find a distance of security between me , and I 'm <unk> , and the natural <unk> on what <unk> to get to look at at the time , and I was <unk> for the last year models of how to do this at the time , trying to find more <unk> ideas and <unk> society to see if you have better ideas and more society to see if you have better ideas and more <unk> ideas and more <unk> ideas .
about how to help people <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of creativity .
And that research <unk> me to the <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> because we 're going to go back to <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> -- people don 't believe that creativity <unk> from men , OK ?
It 's <unk> that creativity was this <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> to men from a few <unk> <unk> and <unk> , for <unk> , for <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> <unk> these <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> creativity of <unk> .
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> to have a <unk> that <unk> <unk> from <unk> .
The <unk> were the same idea , but <unk> that <unk> the <unk> of the spirit without a <unk> .
The <unk> is <unk> , because the <unk> didn 't really know that a <unk> was somebody who are particularly smart .
And I thought that a <unk> was this kind of <unk> <unk> that <unk> literally <unk> in the <unk> of a <unk> , a little <unk> , like the <unk> <unk> , and that <unk> out of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> the <unk> <unk> the work of that work .
<unk> <unk> is , the distance of the distance which I talk -- that <unk> you <unk> you from the results of your work .
And all <unk> that was so that you <unk> , right ?
So artists were <unk> by <unk> things , like example , for example too <unk> , no ?
If your work was <unk> not <unk> <unk> all of the <unk> , all of <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
If your work <unk> , it 's not all <unk> your , right ?
All you know , it was your <unk> to be a <unk> .
And so the people <unk> <unk> creativity in <unk> for a long time .
And then the <unk> <unk> and all <unk> , and <unk> this great idea ; we put the human being on the center of the universe on the center of the universe , and the <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> this big space .
This was the principle of <unk> <unk> and people <unk> to think that creativity is completely completely <unk> by the <unk> .
And for the first time in the history , <unk> to <unk> or that artist as a <unk> <unk> to a <unk> person with a <unk> <unk> .
And I must <unk> , I think it was a big <unk> .
I think I <unk> to somebody , a simple person to believe that as a <unk> , the <unk> and the <unk> of all the <unk> <unk> , <unk> and <unk> and <unk> <unk> , <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> is a <unk> <unk> to the human <unk> .
It 's like to ask somebody to <unk> the sun .
<unk> and <unk> completely <unk> and <unk> all these <unk> <unk> on the <unk> .
And I think it was this pressure to have <unk> artists in the <unk> 500 years .
And , if this is true , and I think it 's the question , it 's going to be , and now ?
We can do it <unk> ?
We can go back to a more <unk> of the relationship between humans and <unk> .
Or maybe not .
Maybe we can 't <unk> 500 years of <unk> thinking in a <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
And probably there is people in the audience that <unk> <unk> <unk> on the <unk> of <unk> , you do you do people <unk> <unk> to <unk> their projects .
You probably probably probably probably <unk> you all about this thing .
But the question I would like to <unk> is -- why ?
Why don 't you know this way ?
Because it has more sense of any other thing ever heard about the <unk> of the <unk> process .
And one process that , as anyone who ever <unk> to do something -- so , we 're all here -- you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know ,
And , in fact , it can be completely <unk> .
I did this <unk> <unk> with the extraordinary <unk> <unk> , who has been a <unk> for all life and said that during his <unk> <unk> , and he said that during his <unk> <unk> , <unk> out of the <unk> <unk> , <unk> out of the <unk> , and they <unk> it , in the <unk> <unk> from the <unk> .
He said it was like a <unk> <unk> of the air .
And that <unk> <unk> to her <unk> .
It 's going to get it , because he was <unk> the land under her feet .
<unk> to have one thing to do that at that point and it was , words , " <unk> like a <unk> . "
And so I <unk> to the house and it was <unk> by this <unk> , and it would not have to get a piece of paper and a little bit <unk> , while the <unk> and <unk> on the page .
<unk> times , they didn 't get to be <unk> enough , and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> the <unk> and her <unk> and she would <unk> through the <unk> and she would <unk> <unk> through the <unk> , and he would <unk> it to <unk> it , and she would be <unk> with <unk> , and he would <unk> it to <unk> it , and she would <unk> <unk> it ,
And then there were those times -- this piece of never <unk> -- there were no <unk> , OK ?
So , he was <unk> to home and he was trying to paper and <unk> the <unk> through , and he <unk> a <unk> <unk> in the while that he was <unk> , and then said , it was like if you <unk> with the other hand and <unk> .
<unk> the <unk> <unk> from the tail and the <unk> on the <unk> .
And in these cases , the <unk> would be <unk> on the <unk> , and <unk> the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> word .
So when I <unk> <unk> -- it 's <unk> , it 's exactly <unk> to my <unk> process .
I don 't know my <unk> process -- I 'm not a <unk> !
I 'm a <unk> , and my way of <unk> is ; it <unk> at the same <unk> every day and <unk> and <unk> on the <unk> .
But even I , in my <unk> , I <unk> against that thing , sometimes .
And I 'm going to <unk> that a lot of you <unk> .
You know , even though the work and the ideas <unk> me from a certain source , I would not have <unk> <unk> .
And what is this thing ?
And how can we <unk> it in the way we can 't do the head , but rather , rather , that <unk> <unk> <unk> ?
For the best example I have <unk> <unk> , which I have a different <unk> <unk> , which I <unk> different years ago .
<unk> <unk> of this , and you know , <unk> , for the <unk> of life was the <unk> <unk> , <unk> , trying to control , <unk> these species of <unk> <unk> <unk> .
But then <unk> , he was <unk> , and a day while he was <unk> on a <unk> <unk> , <unk> all for him .
<unk> <unk> , and all of a <unk> <unk> this little <unk> of <unk> , which comes into his head as the <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , and <unk> , and you want , you know , it 's wonderful , and the <unk> , but it doesn 't know how to <unk> .
It 's not a piece of paper , it doesn 't have a <unk> , it doesn 't have a <unk> .
So it starts to feel this kind of old <unk> <unk> in him , " I 'm going to <unk> , and <unk> <unk> from this song .
I 'm not <unk> enough <unk> and I can 't <unk> . "
And instead of go to the <unk> , they <unk> .
<unk> the whole <unk> process and made something completely new .
<unk> just the sky and said , " <unk> , you know , you know , I 'm not going to <unk> ? "
" It seems to you know that can write a song now ?
If you really want to <unk> , you 're going to take it in a more <unk> when I can <unk> care of you .
<unk> , <unk> to <unk> <unk> more <unk> today .
<unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> . "
And his <unk> <unk> process after this .
I don 't work , the work was still <unk> as always .
But the process , and the <unk> <unk> that <unk> was <unk> when he was <unk> the <unk> , the <unk> that <unk> out of him , and the <unk> <unk> that <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> . And I was going to be a <unk> , and <unk> <unk> .
But <unk> this <unk> , wonderful <unk> <unk> a conversation between <unk> and this thing <unk> and <unk> that was not <unk> .
So , as <unk> that story to change a little bit about the way I <unk> and I 've already <unk> a time .
This idea , I <unk> when I was <unk> , " <unk> , " and I <unk> , " and I <unk> in one of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> that we 're working on something and you can 't think that a <unk> , what the <unk> is going to be written .
It 's not just <unk> , just the <unk> book .
And I started to think of <unk> this project .
But then I <unk> to <unk> that <unk> the air and <unk> us .
So I <unk> my face in the <unk> and <unk> my <unk> to a <unk> <unk> <unk> of the room .
And I said to <unk> <unk> , " <unk> , " <unk> , " What 's , you know , if this is not going to be <unk> , no ?
Because you see I 'm going to <unk> all that I , I don 't have more than this .
So if you want that to be better , you have to do your part .
OK . But if you don 't do it , you know what , I don 't know .
I 'm going to write the same because it 's my work .
And I would like to say that it was <unk> that I <unk> to do my <unk> to do my part . " Because it 's so , <unk> <unk> <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> of the moon , and <unk> music that <unk> <unk> to hours to <unk> and hours to <unk> .
And they were always <unk> , because the <unk> were <unk> .
But every <unk> , something that 's <unk> , and one of these artists <unk> actually <unk> .
And I know you know what I talk about , because I know you 've got all of it , a <unk> .
It was like the time , and the <unk> <unk> through a species of <unk> and <unk> through a species of <unk> and it was doing anything else from the <unk> , as the <unk> <unk> <unk> before , but it was <unk> .
And it 's all of a sudden not just human .
But it <unk> from the <unk> and <unk> under the <unk> of <unk> .
And when this <unk> , to the time , people <unk> what was , he <unk> with her name .
<unk> your hands and <unk> to <unk> , " <unk> , <unk> , God , " God , "
That 's God , you know .
<unk> <unk> <unk> -- when the <unk> <unk> the <unk> , <unk> this <unk> with them and <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , which you can see in the <unk> or <unk> .
In <unk> , when a artist did something impossible and <unk> , " <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> -- a <unk> of God .
And it 's <unk> because we need .
But , the problem is the next day , after the <unk> , when you <unk> and <unk> that are <unk> <unk> and <unk> that are <unk> <unk> of <unk> and <unk> God 's <unk> .
It 's just a <unk> with a lot of <unk> to the <unk> , and maybe never <unk> to <unk> that <unk> .
And maybe nobody <unk> the name of God still as <unk> , and what 's going to do with the rest of his life ?
It 's hard .
This is one of the most <unk> <unk> to do in a <unk> life .
But maybe it doesn 't have to be <unk> so <unk> if you 're <unk> , you know , the most <unk> of your being being being being being being being by you .
But I just <unk> that you 're going to get data in <unk> from a source of this <unk> part of your life , then you 've got to <unk> .
And , you know , if we think about this way .
And so I started to <unk> , and it 's <unk> , and it 's <unk> for different months during the <unk> of the book that <unk> , the <unk> , <unk> of my <unk> success .
And what I must continue to go when I feel <unk> by this is , not <unk> .
You don 't know . <unk> just your work .
You can <unk> to <unk> your side , any way .
If your work is <unk> , <unk> .
If the <unk> , you 're going to <unk> <unk> <unk> some kind of <unk> , for a few kind of <unk> , for a moment through your <unk> , then you know ! "
<unk> , you do the same <unk> .
And " <unk> ! " You know , " <unk> !
I think , and I think it <unk> <unk> .
" <unk> ! " <unk> ! " <unk> . "
Thank you .
Thank you .
<unk> <unk> : <unk> !
And as you know , I 've been talking about some of these projects on the human genome , on what can <unk> and discovery of new <unk> .
Now we 're going to <unk> a new way : we started to <unk> biology and now start from that digital code , we 're going to be <unk> in a new <unk> of biology , <unk> and <unk> life .
We 've always been trying to <unk> big questions .
" <unk> is life ? " It 's something that many <unk> , I think they have to understand to various levels .
We tried different <unk> , <unk> to the <unk> terms .
We 're <unk> by almost 20 years .
When we <unk> the human genome <unk> to go from the world biology to the digital world of the computer .
Now , we can we <unk> the life , or create new life from this digital universe ?
This is the map of a little <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , which is the species from the <unk> genome that can <unk> in the lab .
And we tried to <unk> to <unk> the genome for <unk> one more more small .
We are able to <unk> a <unk> of genes about 500 <unk> that are here .
But when we take a look at her map , it 's simple than our .
<unk> , this is simple .
But when we look at all the genes that we can <unk> , one at the time , is very <unk> that this can take a <unk> cell .
So I <unk> that the only <unk> <unk> was <unk> this <unk> way to <unk> the <unk> for some of these questions .
And so we started the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> ? "
Can you have <unk> chemistry to produce these big molecules that we never have never been able to create before we now ?
And , in case , we can <unk> a <unk> ?
A <unk> is just a piece of <unk> <unk> material .
The speed that we 're able to <unk> life is <unk> to <unk> <unk> .
Our ability to write the <unk> code , rather <unk> , rather slowly , but it 's <unk> .
And our most <unk> <unk> <unk> to a <unk> <unk> .
We have <unk> more than 15 years ago .
The process has <unk> a lot of <unk> , <unk> with a <unk> <unk> before we <unk> the first experiments .
But we found that <unk> of DNA is very difficult .
There are <unk> of thousands of cars to the world that <unk> small DNA , of <unk> <unk> of 30 <unk> and is a <unk> process : the most <unk> is a <unk> process .
And so we had to develop a new <unk> to <unk> these <unk> and <unk> the <unk> .
And this was our first <unk> , to go from digital information of the genome of <unk> <unk> .
It 's a small virus that <unk> bacteria .
We designed <unk> , <unk> the <unk> of <unk> <unk> and <unk> a <unk> of DNA <unk> of about <unk> <unk> .
The interesting part is when we took this piece of <unk> material and we <unk> it in the bacteria , the bacteria have <unk> to read this code and <unk> .
The particles are <unk> <unk> from cells , they 're <unk> by cells , and they <unk> <unk> .
I talked about recently with the <unk> <unk> industry that they have <unk> this model .
They have more than you .
And it 's a situation where the software can actually build its same <unk> system in a <unk> system .
But I 'll do the biggest things in big .
We had to build the whole <unk> of <unk> .
I 'm more than <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> code .
So we thought about <unk> in the size of the virus , so that we can change the <unk> to understand what the <unk> of a cell cell .
<unk> is <unk> , and if you <unk> information in a computer , these have to be very <unk> .
When we <unk> this genome for the first time in the <unk> <unk> was of a <unk> for every 10 <unk> <unk> .
We found , <unk> , 30 <unk> . If we used that original <unk> <unk> never never been able to do this work .
One part of the process is to design <unk> 50 <unk> that <unk> with all the other <unk> of the other <unk> to build more small <unk> <unk> .
We 're going to be <unk> <unk> .
You 're probably read that that <unk> <unk> us .
<unk> <unk> : We have a <unk> <unk> on four <unk> : <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> and <unk>
<unk> of those <unk> <unk> together , about 20 <unk> , and there 's a <unk> order to <unk> every <unk> .
So we can use the <unk> code to write words , <unk> .
What we did at the beginning is <unk> .
Some have been <unk> by the fact that it didn 't know .
We designed these <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> .
There are <unk> that <unk> them and <unk> <unk> .
And we started to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
We 've got this <unk> in <unk> <unk> so that we 're <unk> to create a <unk> <unk> that we 're going to create a very <unk> <unk> , as you 'll see in a minute .
We 're trying to <unk> the process .
So , this seems to be the <unk> of a <unk> of <unk> .
When we <unk> these <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , more than 100 <unk> , they don 't get more directly to the <unk> <unk> .
It 's <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> biology .
So we <unk> other <unk> .
<unk> of another <unk> called <unk> <unk> , which is in biology <unk> to <unk> DNA that can <unk> the <unk> .
Here 's a example .
This <unk> , called <unk> <unk> , can <unk> three million <unk> of <unk> .
You can see in the <unk> <unk> as his <unk> is <unk> .
In 12 -- 12 hours it 's <unk> exactly as it was before .
<unk> of thousands of organisms that are able to do this .
These organisms can be completely <unk> .
We had to live under <unk> .
And it 's absolutely sure that life in space , and they <unk> to find new <unk> of water .
And at the real , NASA has showed that this is .
This is an image of the <unk> that we built these <unk> , just using the <unk> with design <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> <unk> .
This image was not <unk> with a <unk> <unk> , but with a <unk> <unk> .
It 's a <unk> so big that we can <unk> with a <unk> <unk> .
These are pictures that <unk> a time of about six seconds .
This is the <unk> that we did a little time ago .
I 'm more than <unk> <unk> <unk> code .
It 's the largest <unk> of a <unk> structure ever <unk> from man .
It 's a <unk> <unk> to 300 million .
If you <unk> it with a <unk> 10 <unk> <unk> pages for <unk> this code .
Now , how do we do it ? How can we <unk> ?
<unk> , through a virus is a <unk> game .
It 's a little bit more <unk> when they use .
It 's <unk> <unk> cells .
In the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> is instead of <unk> in the cell , but we <unk> that we 're able to do a <unk> <unk> of a cell <unk> from a cell to a cell <unk> from a cell to a cell , and <unk> .
We have a <unk> <unk> <unk> from a species .
The two are different as men from the <unk> .
We have some <unk> <unk> in more way that you could have to <unk> what to <unk> this .
<unk> <unk> <unk> .
And when we put it in the cell was <unk> and <unk> our <unk> <unk> <unk> the new <unk> is <unk> .
And <unk> <unk> that we didn 't go beyond , but we tried to <unk> more in there .
This is one of the biggest <unk> of evolution .
We found that <unk> species have a second or a third <unk> from some of a few <unk> , <unk> in a second thousands of new <unk> to that species .
So who think about the evolution of the evolution of the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> that was in the cell <unk> .
<unk> <unk> that we <unk> .
It 's <unk> , and it <unk> the other <unk> as <unk> material , has <unk> , and we <unk> it with only the cell and the new <unk> .
has become blue because of the genes that we <unk> .
And in a short <unk> of time , all the <unk> of a species are <unk> , and it 's <unk> of all over a new species , <unk> on the software new software , we <unk> on the cell .
And the <unk> are <unk> , the <unk> are <unk> , and when we <unk> the <unk> code exactly what we have <unk> .
Now , this may seem <unk> <unk> , but we <unk> the software DNA can change things things in a <unk> enough <unk> .
Now , I 've already <unk> that here is not about <unk> -- but of progress to <unk> -- but of progress to the evolution of evolution , and a half years , and I 've already said that maybe we 're going to create new species of <unk> <unk> new species on this process .
Why do that ?
I think it 's enough to <unk> when we think about our <unk> .
We 're going to go from six billion and a half a half a half of people in the next 40 years .
Right to give one example : I was born in <unk> .
Now , there are three people on the planet to <unk> <unk> in <unk> ; in 40 years , there will be four .
We 're <unk> problems now at food , water <unk> and <unk> , <unk> and <unk> for six billion and a half and a half billion people .
We 're going to do it for nine billion .
<unk> more than five billion <unk> <unk> , more than 30 billion <unk> <unk> .
That means percent of <unk> a day .
When we try to find <unk> <unk> , or any kind of process for <unk> , it will be a huge challenge .
We have to <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> of CO2 from these materials that <unk> in the atmosphere .
At the day , thank you at the <unk> <unk> around the world , we have a <unk> with about 20 million genes , and I like to think that are the <unk> for the future .
The <unk> industry is just a <unk> about <unk> , and think about how many different things are <unk> out .
Our <unk> here are data <unk> from the <unk> reality , and from our imagination .
We now have <unk> , thank you to these <unk> <unk> of <unk> , can create what we call <unk> <unk> .
We are able to build a big robot that can produce a million <unk> a day .
Think of <unk> these 20 million genes or <unk> to <unk> the <unk> to produce <unk> or <unk> , new <unk> , new <unk> , new <unk> , we can change , new <unk> , and create more biology now that in the last 20 years of science .
And it 's just a <unk> <unk> .
We can choose to <unk> , <unk> chemistry or <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
This is a <unk> of some software software <unk> that we 're working on to be able to <unk> and species to design .
Well , we don 't know how to be .
We know exactly what it is their <unk> code .
We 're now <unk> on the <unk> of <unk> generation .
You saw you also you know that <unk> <unk> from the <unk> was a <unk> experiment .
We have <unk> <unk> <unk> , the third generation that <unk> enough to <unk> <unk> more <unk> value like the <unk> or different kinds of <unk> .
But the only way that biology can have a big impact without <unk> the cost of food and <unk> the <unk> would be <unk> the food of food and <unk> the <unk> would be <unk> to design cells that can reach this , and we think we can <unk> the first generation of <unk> <unk> in about 18 months .
The solar light <unk> with CO2 is a <unk> , but in our <unk> <unk> in all the world , we found different <unk> .
This is a <unk> that we <unk> in the <unk> .
It 's <unk> in the ocean , about <unk> feet of the water <unk> .
<unk> <unk> from CO2 using hydrogen <unk> as hydrogen <unk> .
We 're trying to understand if we can <unk> CO2 , which can easily be <unk> through <unk> , <unk> that CO2 in <unk> , to drive this process .
So , I think we could be able to <unk> what the question of the base of " that 's the <unk> of the <unk> industry . We have the <unk> <unk> the whole <unk> industry .
<unk> . If you can 't do this TED , where you can ?
It 's a main source of energy .
And we 're working , we 're working for the same <unk> to create <unk> .
You saw this year with flu , we 're always <unk> back of a year and with a dollar in less when it 's <unk> .
I think what you can change building <unk> <unk> in <unk> .
So , here 's how the future could start <unk> , the tree of evolution , <unk> the evolution of evolution , <unk> the evolution of bacteria , <unk> , and then <unk> cells .
We are <unk> so much from <unk> people .
Our purpose is to do in a way to be <unk> enough to try to try to try to <unk> .
First of all I 'm going to do you to see , the most <unk> work , new technology that we have <unk> to <unk> <unk> to a <unk> <unk> , almost a year ago . This is <unk> .
It 's a environment where you can <unk> is <unk> in the local level that <unk> with a huge amount of data .
And here we 're seeing <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> with a kind of <unk> <unk> and <unk> , for a <unk> <unk> , <unk> images as we want .
And it doesn 't matter how big the amount of information that we see , how big these data are .
Most are <unk> <unk> <unk> , but this for example is a <unk> <unk> by the <unk> of the <unk> , and <unk> in <unk> of 300 <unk> .
It 's not a difference because the only thing that <unk> the <unk> of a system like this is the number of <unk> on your screen in any moment . It 's a very <unk> architecture .
This is a whole book , example of data is not <unk> .
This is <unk> <unk> <unk> . Every <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And so it 's about the <unk> and not about images , we can do something like this , to <unk> , to see that it 's a real <unk> of the <unk> , not a picture .
It could be a little bit <unk> to read a little book .
You can 't tell you .
This is a <unk> example . It 's a <unk> number of <unk> .
Every picture is the beginning of a <unk> .
And it gives you really give you the <unk> of a <unk> <unk> or a <unk> , or a <unk> , which is for nature of a half a half .
We also did something with the corner of this particular number of this particular number of <unk> .
We created a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> much more than that you use in a normal <unk> , and we <unk> it in the <unk> of the <unk> .
If you want to see the <unk> of this <unk> , you can see here .
Or other models , or even <unk> <unk> .
And this really <unk> some of these ideas to <unk> the <unk> of space on the screen .
And I thought this <unk> to put it to the <unk> and other <unk> , not <unk> to be <unk> .
Of course , the <unk> is one of the <unk> <unk> for this kind of technology .
And on this , I don 't want to <unk> time , if we don 't say that we have <unk> to give you a <unk> to be in this field .
These are all the streets in the United States <unk> on a NASA <unk> image .
So now I 'm going to start to do it .
This is actually <unk> in the Web .
It 's a project called <unk> , which <unk> two different technologies .
One is <unk> and the other is a <unk> <unk> to the computer very interesting computer <unk> , a student of the Washington , with help <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> and <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And it 's in the Web , <unk> <unk> .
You can <unk> when we do this kind of <unk> , where we can go from another image and have this kind of experience to <unk> <unk> .
But the <unk> <unk> of images here has actually a meaning .
And the <unk> of <unk> <unk> have <unk> these images together , so that <unk> to the places that <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> on the <unk> <unk> <unk> on the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and these things are all <unk> <unk> <unk> .
I don 't know if I have time to show you some other environment .
There are a lot more <unk> .
I want to go to one of the <unk> data <unk> of <unk> and this <unk> from a <unk> <unk> of <unk> that we did work for the first time <unk> to show you what <unk> is really the key behind this technology , the <unk> technology , the <unk> technology , the <unk> technology , the <unk> technology , the <unk> , we <unk> it .
We had to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and so forth .
This is a <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> and <unk> images of <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> of these <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . And he 's <unk> of these <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
So I 'm all <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and have all <unk> <unk> level in this way .
And it 's possible to <unk> this <unk> way .
You know , I would never have thought about the end of the work for <unk> .
It 's very <unk> <unk> this kind of <unk> here .
I think I think you 're going to see that is a lot of different kinds of <unk> : from those phones <unk> , a number <unk> , <unk> together in this environment .
And if I can , I <unk> to try to the more <unk> .
Many are <unk> by <unk> , etc .
And then , in the <unk> here is a series of photographs -- <unk> .
This is a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
We can go from the <unk> physics of this environment .
The <unk> is that we can do things with social environment . This is now <unk> data from the whole memory of the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> of <unk> , from the point of <unk> <unk> and <unk> all of the data together .
All those pictures become <unk> together , more than the <unk> .
You have a model of the whole <unk> .
Think about this as the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> on Earth .
It 's something that <unk> in the <unk> of complexity , and the <unk> that <unk> for those who <unk> <unk> with the use .
Their pictures are <unk> with <unk> <unk> from other people .
If you 're going to be the idea of <unk> all these <unk> <unk> the name , my picture of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of all those data , and I can use that <unk> to <unk> in space , using pictures of anyone , and have a social experience .
Of course , a <unk> of all interesting models is extremely <unk> of every interesting part of the earth , <unk> , <unk> not only <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> , but from the <unk> <unk> .
Thank you .
Chris Anderson : I realized ? What is the one of your software <unk> us to do is that at a certain point , in the next years , all the photographs of the <unk> <unk> from anyone in the world will be <unk> together ?
<unk> : Yes . What 's doing is doing in fact , it 's <unk> .
It 's creating <unk> , if you want , between images .
And it 's doing it in the <unk> of the images .
And the thing becomes very interesting , if you think about the <unk> information that a lot of these <unk> images .
And as you do a <unk> of images on the web , you <unk> a <unk> and the <unk> on the web page has a lot of information about images .
Now , what happens if that picture is going to be <unk> to all your picture ?
So the amount of <unk> <unk> and the amount of <unk> that is really huge . It 's a <unk> effect .
CA : <unk> , it 's really amazing .
<unk> : I 'm going to tell you very much .
One of the main <unk> when you <unk> and one of the <unk> <unk> is the <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> , the past the <unk> <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
We think that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , or that the <unk> <unk> , or that the <unk> <unk> are still <unk> of <unk> , or <unk> , or <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> , to remember the <unk> <unk> , to remember the <unk> of the <unk> , to remember the <unk> <unk> , and that the idea that the world that the world we don 't have a sense , but only <unk> , is a sense of a sense of <unk> ,
And the <unk> of a particular <unk> of <unk> choices that our <unk> has done , well or <unk> , a lot of <unk> .
And , of course , all <unk> <unk> <unk> .
All right . All right .
We are <unk> to <unk> <unk> .
We need to <unk> the death of death , so we don 't know if you <unk> and <unk> --
We all have a art .
What <unk> is the <unk> of the song , the <unk> of the <unk> of every culture .
It doesn 't matter that are the <unk> of the <unk> , or the <unk> of <unk> <unk> , or the <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> , or the <unk> of the <unk> , or a <unk> in the heart of the <unk> , or a <unk> in the heart of the <unk> <unk> .
He was my <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> a month ago , or a <unk> of <unk> <unk> , on the <unk> , the <unk> mother of the world .
And all these <unk> <unk> that there are other ways of <unk> other ways of <unk> , other ways to move in the world .
And , if you get a moment , is a concept that can give you hope .
<unk> , the <unk> of <unk> of the world create a <unk> of <unk> life and <unk> that <unk> the planet and <unk> the planet is the <unk> of the planet as the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And you can think of this <unk> <unk> as a <unk> and can <unk> the <unk> of all the <unk> of all the <unk> , dreams , <unk> , <unk> ideas , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> in the human imagination .
<unk> is the great <unk> of humanity .
It 's the <unk> of what we are and what we can be in how to be .
And I <unk> the <unk> was <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , for example , <unk> that 50 percent of all species was the species was or on the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> diversity -- and it 's <unk> , or -- in the <unk> <unk> of diversity -- and you don 't even even <unk> <unk> -- that 's <unk> <unk> -- that of diversity .
The <unk> of this is , of course , the <unk> <unk> .
When you 're <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> on this planet .
One language is not <unk> only by a <unk> or a series of rules .
One language is the <unk> of the human spirit .
It 's the middle with which the <unk> of every culture comes in in the world material .
Every language is a forest of the mind , a <unk> thought , a thought , a <unk> of <unk> .
And of those <unk> <unk> , while we 're here in <unk> , at least half the <unk> is not <unk> in the <unk> of the children .
They 're not <unk> to the children , the <unk> , which means , less than <unk> , which is death .
What 's more <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> , of the <unk> of the last to talk about a language , of the <unk> of <unk> or <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> or <unk> the <unk> of the children ?
This <unk> <unk> is the state of someone in some part of the world every two weeks : every two weeks , a <unk> <unk> and door with itself in the <unk> of a <unk> language .
And I know that somebody of you <unk> " <unk> " <unk> . " It 's not better ?
The world would not be a better place if you know all the same language ? " <unk> , then we talk about all .
<unk> <unk> .
<unk> of a <unk> thing , that means , you can 't talk about their language .
Today , I 'd like to give you a journey through the <unk> --
a little journey in the <unk> to give you a <unk> of what we 're going to happen .
Many of us <unk> that when I say , " different ways of <unk> .
<unk> for example , this <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , the <unk> of <unk> , which <unk> <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
It 's a <unk> that 's not <unk> the color that 's not going to <unk> the color of the green because the time <unk> is <unk> in the time of the <unk> .
They have a <unk> language and a <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , " <unk> <unk> a person who 's talking about a different language .
And all of this has <unk> in the <unk> <unk> , yet the <unk> is that in these families or seven or seven <unk> because of the <unk> <unk> .
It 's going to hear and then <unk> to talk .
<unk> one of the most interesting <unk> with the <unk> that I 've been <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , a incredible <unk> that has had the first <unk> in the <unk> .
In the <unk> five <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> .
They made out of the top <unk> that <unk> them in <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> that this <unk> of the <unk> forest had never seen nothing .
They <unk> the picture of the earth , they <unk> to the research of a form or a <unk> , and they don 't know anything , they <unk> , they <unk> <unk> , and they have <unk> <unk> <unk> with <unk> .
But <unk> don 't <unk> only <unk> .
They 're <unk> between them .
<unk> percent of <unk> <unk> <unk> .
We are <unk> to eight <unk> and we found two cases of death and when we <unk> to know , they have <unk> that one of them was so that he 's dead , and then they <unk> it . [ <unk> ] <unk> . And then they <unk> it .
The <unk> were able to <unk> the animal <unk> from 40 <unk> and <unk> the species .
<unk> <unk> , I was <unk> a very interesting job when my <unk> of <unk> <unk> , if my <unk> of <unk> <unk> , I wanted to go to <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to make <unk> <unk> .
To give a sense of the <unk> , I would have to understand the <unk> culture and that <unk> is not <unk> <unk> .
It 's pretty much about a <unk> <unk> <unk> of the world .
Very interesting .
If you <unk> to <unk> the big <unk> of the world , what would you do ?
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , etc .
A continent is always left out , thinking that Africa <unk> doesn 't have <unk> <unk> . And instead of yes , and the <unk> is not the <unk> of these <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
What makes the <unk> is the <unk> of the <unk> between life and death .
So the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> can be <unk> by the <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> and <unk> to the <unk> of the live live in so that for a short moment , the <unk> is the <unk> .
And so the <unk> <unk> to say , " <unk> <unk> you go to talk about God .
We <unk> in the <unk> and <unk> God . "
And the moment that you 're <unk> , is the spirit that you can <unk> you , how can you get you ?
So , you know , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a pretty strong <unk> of the power of the body <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And I 've been <unk> all the <unk> with the <unk> that I 've been the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , in the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> of the <unk> civilization that once <unk> on the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> on the <unk> <unk> .
In a <unk> continent of blood , this <unk> never been <unk> by <unk> .
<unk> today are <unk> by a <unk> , but their <unk> is extraordinary .
The young <unk> are <unk> <unk> from families to three or four years , and they live in a world <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> to the <unk> of <unk> for 18 years .
Two <unk> of nine years <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
For this time , they 're <unk> to values that their society , values that they <unk> and only their <unk> and only their <unk> <unk> <unk> -- or to say the <unk> <unk> .
At the <unk> of this incredible <unk> , they 're <unk> <unk> out and for the first time in their life , at the age of 18 years , they see a <unk> . And in that moment of the first <unk> , when the <unk> <unk> <unk> of the first <unk> , all that they have been <unk> theory in the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , and it 's going to go back to the <unk> : <unk> and I <unk> :
" <unk> ? <unk> as I said .
It 's <unk> . Now it 's <unk> . "
They call it the biggest and they say that , <unk> <unk> , we are the <unk> of the world of the world .
This is extremely important .
When we think about the <unk> <unk> and the <unk> environment , and the old story of the <unk> <unk> , which is a <unk> concept in his <unk> or maybe <unk> <unk> and <unk> and say that these <unk> are more <unk> to Earth .
<unk> <unk> are not <unk> <unk> or <unk> by the <unk> .
There 's no space for these things in the <unk> of the <unk> or in the <unk> <unk> , but thank you at time and <unk> , have created a <unk> of the Earth 's <unk> not about the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . But the <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> , but it can live in a <unk> of human <unk> .
What does that mean ?
It 's saying that a <unk> of the <unk> that <unk> the mountain is a <unk> <unk> that <unk> its <unk> is going to be a human <unk> , and it 's going to be a <unk> of the mountain or that place in a <unk> of the mountain that <unk> <unk> <unk> a mountain <unk> <unk> that <unk> a mountain is a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to be <unk> .
That 's the <unk> of one <unk> or a <unk> <unk> is <unk> .
What 's interesting is the <unk> that <unk> the relationship between the <unk> and the natural world .
I grew up in the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to be <unk> .
And that has made me a human being different from my friends who believe that <unk> are the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> that live in the <unk> of the world , <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> .
If you 're going to <unk> that these <unk> can create different , we can start to understand some of their <unk> <unk> .
I <unk> this picture at <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> .
Maybe some of you have heard about the <unk> , the most powerful <unk> of the <unk> <unk> .
What makes the <unk> is not the <unk> potential of the <unk> , but her <unk> . It 's <unk> by two <unk> .
<unk> , this <unk> <unk> <unk> a series of <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> the only <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
This <unk> <unk> <unk> , very similar to the <unk> , <unk> .
If you 'll ever see the <unk> <unk> on the <unk> for the <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
<unk> that <unk> on the <unk> for the <unk> is a little bit like to be <unk> by a <unk> <unk> of <unk> and <unk> on a sea of electricity . [ <unk> ] ] ] <unk> of reality ; it doesn 't create the <unk> of the reality .
<unk> <unk> <unk> , the man who was <unk> <unk> , the man who <unk> was <unk> , with her discovery of <unk> <unk> in the ' <unk> in the ' <unk> .
My <unk> is not <unk> these <unk> as you can 't tell these <unk> as you 're <unk> , because if you 're <unk> to be <unk> . [ <unk> ] ] <unk> .
It 's possible to <unk> <unk> if you can <unk> with other <unk> <unk> that <unk> .
Now it 's the beautiful : the <unk> that are <unk> of the <unk> , of the same kind of <unk> for <unk> . The question <unk> <unk> : in a <unk> of <unk> species , like <unk> <unk> <unk> . <unk> : in a <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
We use the great <unk> of <unk> and <unk> , which can <unk> <unk> .
But if you go to the <unk> , we 'll say , " The plants is about .
What does that mean ?
This <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , which <unk> <unk> in the forest , and that our eyes <unk> in the same species .
If you <unk> how do they <unk> their <unk> <unk> us , " <unk> of plants , of the rest of the rest of you know ? " I said , " No . "
The solution is : you take the <unk> <unk> in a night of moon <unk> <unk> with a different <unk> .
With this <unk> is not <unk> to <unk> , but it 's much more interesting that <unk> the <unk> .
Now , [ <unk> ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ]
In fact , the <unk> century , in 300 years , not <unk> for his <unk> or her <unk> , but rather like was where it was where we <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> of diversity and <unk> <unk> of diversity and <unk> of the planet . Now , <unk> <unk> of the planet . Now , it 's not the change .
All the <unk> through the <unk> were <unk> in a <unk> for new chance of life .
And the problem is not technology .
<unk> <unk> have no <unk> to be <unk> when they put <unk> <unk> and <unk> so they <unk> it as the <unk> <unk> , they <unk> <unk> to be when they <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
It 's not the change or technology that <unk> the <unk> of <unk> . It 's power .
The <unk> <unk> of <unk> .
And if you 're going to go to the world , <unk> that these are not <unk> to <unk> .
They are <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> out of the <unk> forces that go beyond their <unk> <unk> .
<unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of <unk> --
a <unk> <unk> of <unk> , in the <unk> <unk> , a <unk> that has been <unk> in the forest to a generation , and now <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> , where you can see the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> from the <unk> that seems to be <unk> <unk> <unk> , where the <unk> <unk> <unk> , where the <unk> <unk> <unk> , where the <unk> <unk> , where the <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> ,
We 're going to <unk> the <unk> with the <unk> <unk> to the forest .
Or , in the case of <unk> , are the disease that are <unk> with the discovery of <unk> .
If you <unk> on the <unk> of the <unk> , where I 'm doing a lot of research , you 'll see the <unk> of politics .
As <unk> <unk> , the <unk> physics of a <unk> , is <unk> <unk> level , but the <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> of life of a <unk> , not just <unk> , but <unk> <unk> in some <unk> , because it 's part of <unk> .
And you can 't understand the <unk> of the <unk> until you can 't see the beginning .
I <unk> the <unk> miles from <unk> in the <unk> China through the <unk> <unk> , <unk> with a young <unk> , but only <unk> <unk> with a young <unk> , but only <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> million people <unk> from the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The father of this guy was <unk> at the <unk> <unk> .
And the means that it 's been <unk> to the Chinese days of Chinese .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> with <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> that has taken the <unk> in <unk> .
My mother was <unk> and <unk> was <unk> .
It 's been <unk> <unk> in <unk> at the age of two years <unk> under his <unk> , because it would not live without him .
The <unk> , who did this , was <unk> in <unk> <unk> .
A day has <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> and , for this <unk> , was <unk> to the <unk> <unk> for seven years .
The pain of the <unk> can be <unk> , but the spirit of the <unk> of <unk> is by <unk> .
And then , all <unk> up to a choice .
Do you live in the world of <unk> or we want to <unk> the world of diversity ?
The great <unk> <unk> <unk> , before you 're going to die , before her greatest <unk> was that , in our <unk> <unk> <unk> of the world of human imagination , not only <unk> the whole <unk> of the human imagination to a <unk> of human imagination , and a day <unk> us to a <unk> <unk> <unk> that there were other possibility .
And it 's <unk> to remember that our species is <unk> for <unk> years .
<unk> <unk> , which has given us to agriculture , which has <unk> us to the <unk> of the <unk> , <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> , creating the <unk> of the <unk> , creating the <unk> of <unk> , and we talk about <unk> years ago .
The <unk> world has <unk> <unk> 300 years .
That <unk> story , I didn 't <unk> that we have the answers to all the challenges that we have to <unk> in the <unk> to come .
When these <unk> <unk> of the world is asked what it want to be human , <unk> with <unk> different <unk> .
And it 's in these answers that we all <unk> the chance of being what we are , a species , that has to be a way that all the <unk> and all the <unk> can <unk> . And there are big moments of <unk> .
I <unk> this picture on the <unk> <unk> <unk> , when I went to <unk> <unk> with <unk> , and this man , and this man , <unk> me , and this man , <unk> me the wonderful story of his <unk> .
The government <unk> is not always <unk> with the <unk> <unk> and <unk> in the ' <unk> for <unk> our <unk> , we <unk> them in <unk> .
The <unk> of this man <unk> <unk> .
The family , <unk> for her life , the <unk> all of the <unk> , and all of his <unk> .
We want to know that the <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> .
The <unk> of <unk> were <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> of this man didn 't <unk> by night or <unk> <unk> .
It 's <unk> on , it 's <unk> the <unk> in skin . And I <unk> in your hand . When I did it , the <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
He <unk> <unk> on the <unk> of this <unk> of <unk> <unk> , and when <unk> <unk> , has <unk> a dog .
He <unk> the dog and created a <unk> , with the <unk> <unk> created a <unk> , has <unk> another dog , and it 's <unk> on the <unk> , <unk> <unk> in <unk> .
<unk> to talk about <unk> with nothing ? [ [ <unk> ] And this , in different ways , [ [ [ <unk> <unk> of the <unk> of the world of the world 's <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> government <unk> <unk> to the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of an area of <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> .
It 's their new <unk> . It 's called <unk> .
It 's a <unk> <unk> . We <unk> all the <unk> resources .
One <unk> example of how a <unk> can <unk> with his <unk> .
And , to end , I think it 's pretty <unk> at least who 's been in these <unk> <unk> of the planet , <unk> that they <unk> that they 're not going to do .
For somebody is house .
<unk> <unk> of the human imagination that <unk> to the <unk> of the time . And for us , the dreams of these children , as the dreams of the <unk> of hope .
And we end , we <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> never <unk> to anything .
<unk> that <unk> --
[ <unk> ] ] They 're not <unk> , but we believe that stories can change the world , and maybe we are the best <unk> to tell the stories of the world . Every month our website <unk> <unk> million <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> our <unk> .
Our <unk> are <unk> by millions of people .
Our work is <unk> in the <unk> to bring our audience in the places that <unk> <unk> from which <unk> <unk> from which <unk> <unk> from which <unk> <unk> , and they <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , the <unk> world of <unk> in diversity , and we need to find a <unk> life in a world and <unk> world .
where the <unk> of all the <unk> can <unk> our <unk> <unk> .
Thank you .
I 'm going to talk about some things that wrote in this book that I hope you 've heard about <unk> , and I 'm going to <unk> some <unk> , in the case , you don 't know .
I want to start with what I call " the <unk> <unk> . "
<unk> <unk> of what ?
The <unk> <unk> of all the society <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> : " If we want to <unk> the <unk> of our citizens " The way to do it is <unk> the freedom . "
The reason is , from one side , in fact that the freedom is in itself , it 's <unk> , useful , <unk> for human beings .
And the other is in fact that if we 're <unk> , each of us can do everything that we <unk> our <unk> , without no no one that <unk> our <unk> , without no no one that <unk> in our <unk> .
The way to <unk> the freedom is <unk> .
<unk> people have , more <unk> , and more <unk> , and more is their freedom , more is their <unk> .
This is <unk> , <unk> , is so <unk> <unk> in society that nobody <unk> <unk> in <unk> .
And it 's also <unk> <unk> in our lives .
I 'll show you some examples of what progress has done possible .
This is my <unk> . It 's not particularly big .
I <unk> a simple <unk> on the <unk> to <unk> .
In the <unk> , I got <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> and 12 <unk> that you can buy for you a huge number of <unk> in the <unk> <unk> <unk> that nobody of <unk> <unk> is already <unk> in your <unk> .
That 's what the <unk> .
And then you go to the <unk> <unk> to buy a <unk> : <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
And in this single <unk> <unk> , there 's a great number of <unk> <unk> .
We can do six million and a half different <unk> using the <unk> that there are in a <unk> .
<unk> <unk> that there is <unk> choice .
<unk> <unk> : the world of <unk> .
And once , when I was a child , you could get all the services <unk> , <unk> that were <unk> by <unk> <unk> .
It 's <unk> the phone , you don 't know .
One of that , between the other , was that the phone never <unk> .
These days , they went .
We now have a <unk> <unk> of <unk> , especially between the phones .
That 's the <unk> of the future .
My <unk> is the <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> of the <unk> , and <unk> for <unk> <unk> .
If you 're not going to be seen in the <unk> , you 're <unk> some that soon soon .
And what 's the end is that people <unk> into the <unk> and does this question . And you know , is the answer ? The answer is , " No . "
It 's not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn 't face things .
So , in other things that are much more important than <unk> , <unk> the same <unk> of choices .
<unk> <unk> : It doesn 't go in the United States that you 're <unk> by the <unk> and the <unk> you have to do .
Instead , <unk> from the <unk> , and the <unk> says , " OK , " Well , we could do it , or <unk> , " <unk> " <unk> , " <unk> these <unk> and these <unk> . What do you want to do ? "
You <unk> : " <unk> , what do ? "
And the <unk> says , " <unk> has these <unk> and these <unk> , and <unk> <unk> these <unk> and these <unk> . "
" What do you want to do ? "
And you say , " <unk> if you were me , what do you know ? "
And the <unk> : " But I 'm not her . "
The result we call it " <unk> " , " <unk> <unk> , " <unk> it does it seem a beautiful thing .
But it 's not that one <unk> the weight and responsibility to take decisions from somebody who knows something that , <unk> the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , and it 's <unk> -- and so it 's <unk> -- and so not in <unk> <unk> for <unk> for a patient is patient .
There 's a huge <unk> of <unk> products , <unk> to people like me , and you , that if you think it has no sense , because you can 't <unk> .
But if we can 't we <unk> it , why ?
The answer is that they want to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> of the <unk> of how our <unk> is a question of choice , as you see in this <unk> , " We don 't want to <unk> kids . They 're going to be <unk> . " We need to <unk> . We have to <unk> .
And we can <unk> how many times we <unk> .
And the means that every <unk> , you have to <unk> , you have to decide that kind of person .
<unk> to the family and <unk> , a time the common perspective , <unk> almost for anyone , was that was that you get the <unk> <unk> .
The only choice was with who , not , and even what do after .
<unk> , it 's really <unk> to play .
They 're going to go very smart , and they <unk> them , 20 percent of the time .
And not because they 're less <unk> , because they 're not less <unk> .
But why are <unk> , <unk> to <unk> : " <unk> or not ?
" <unk> <unk> <unk> later ? I 've got to think before the children or to career ? "
They are <unk> <unk> .
And they try to answer these questions , even though this <unk> <unk> , and they don 't have a <unk> <unk> to my <unk> .
And they have to really to do this . They 're important questions .
Now , the work : we 're <unk> , like <unk> <unk> , because technology technology allows us to work for every day , every day , the <unk> of the planet , <unk> that <unk> from the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , there is a <unk> , and I 'm not going to say , where the <unk> works .
I 'm not going to tell you , because I want to use it .
What does , this incredible choice of choice that we have about work ? It 's that we need to decide , <unk> in every moment , if we have to work or no .
We can go to see our child , with the phone , with the phone in a <unk> , the <unk> in the other , and the <unk> , <unk> , on the <unk> .
And even if I 'm all <unk> , every minute that we see our child <unk> <unk> , we 're also <unk> , " I have to answer this called ? "
" I have to answer this <unk> ? I have to <unk> this letter ? "
And even when the answer is , " Well , this makes the experience of your son very different than that it would be in other conditions .
So , from any part of the look at all , little and big things , and <unk> of life , life is a question of choices .
And once the world was this : <unk> , there were some chance , but it was not a question of choice .
The world 's <unk> today to this : The <unk> is , " Is a <unk> thing , or <unk> ?
The answer is <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> <unk> them , we know all , so I 'm going to talk about the <unk> .
<unk> this choice is actually <unk> two actually <unk> on people .
The first , <unk> , is that it makes <unk> <unk> .
With a lot of <unk> in which to <unk> , it becomes very difficult to do it .
I 'll give you a <unk> example : a study <unk> <unk> <unk> .
A <unk> of my <unk> has had access to the data , the <unk> society <unk> , with about a million <unk> in <unk> <unk> .
What she found her is that for every 10 solutions that are <unk> in more , the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> of two percent .
With 50 <unk> <unk> , there 's 10 percent of <unk> than <unk> when they are available .
Because with 50 <unk> <unk> in which to <unk> , is hard to decide , and the choice is <unk> to <unk> .
And at <unk> , and again , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and of course <unk> , and of course , <unk> never comes to .
<unk> that doesn 't mean that this is not just that these <unk> <unk> food for <unk> because they don 't have enough money , they want to say that the decision is so <unk> that they also <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of work .
They 're not <unk> , they 're <unk> to five <unk> <unk> for <unk> year <unk> of work , that would be <unk> to <unk> .
So the <unk> is a <unk> of the <unk> choices .
And I think we <unk> the world .
" And to end it , to the <unk> : <unk> , <unk> or <unk> ? "
It 's going to take the right decision , if it 's the <unk> , right ?
You don 't want to <unk> the bottom , and I <unk> the wrong wrong .
So this is the first effect . The second is that if we can <unk> <unk> and make a choice , to do a choice , at the end is less <unk> by the result of how to <unk> .
And this for different reasons .
One of these is that with a lot of <unk> in which to <unk> , and it 's not perfect , is easy to imagine that it could make a different choice . And what happens is that the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and that 's what 's the <unk> <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> from the choice , and the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of choice , and the <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> ,
And it was a <unk> decision .
The more choices is , more is <unk> of any <unk> that is <unk> of <unk> .
<unk> , there is what <unk> call .
<unk> <unk> has <unk> very well as well as the value that we give things <unk> by what we <unk> .
<unk> , when there are a lot of <unk> possible , is easy to <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> and be less <unk> of the <unk> that 's choice .
And so , this is a <unk> . I <unk> with all that I 'm not in New York .
But it 's what you probably <unk> .
There 's this <unk> to the <unk> .
A place of <unk> .
<unk> <unk> . <unk> day . It 's all about them .
It 's not <unk> . But what he think is , " Well , <unk> , it 's <unk> . "
" All my <unk> are <unk> . "
" <unk> <unk> <unk> right in front of the house . "
And it 's <unk> two weeks from the idea that 's <unk> -- every day -- the chance of <unk> where you want .
The <unk> <unk> <unk> for that we have , even when choice was <unk> .
And the most <unk> are the <unk> that we have <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Here 's another one .
This <unk> tells us a lot of things .
It 's about the living moment , and maybe in the <unk> .
But the most important point is that any <unk> you , you 're going to be <unk> ,
The things that don 't have a lot of <unk> that can make it less <unk> what we do .
<unk> <unk> : <unk> <unk> <unk> .
I tried to my skin <unk> a new couple of <unk> .
It 's almost always <unk> .
And once the <unk> were a one of one , <unk> and <unk> <unk> , they were <unk> , only after <unk> , they were <unk> , just after <unk> a life and <unk> a lot of times , to go .
So , I went to <unk> a new when the <unk> were <unk> , and I said , " I need a couple of <unk> , this is my <unk> . "
The <unk> <unk> said , " <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> ? "
You want them to <unk> or <unk> ? "
" <unk> <unk> wants ? "
" <unk> <unk> <unk> or <unk> ? <unk> <unk> <unk> -- " <unk> to <unk> <unk> .
I was <unk> , and after a little bit of <unk> , I just want to say , " I want the guy that was the only guy , " He had a <unk> me . " It 's <unk> <unk> <unk> , and then <unk> from the store , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , with the best <unk> that I had ever <unk> .
It was the <unk> . With all that choice had <unk> the better .
But I 'm going to say that .
Why ? I wrote a whole book for <unk> .
The reason I was that I was worse is that with all that choice of my <unk> were <unk> , the <unk> to be <unk> .
At the first <unk> , I had <unk> <unk> . I didn 't know anything that when I was a guy , but when they <unk> 100 different , at least one one had to be perfect .
What I had <unk> was good , but not perfect .
After <unk> <unk> that <unk> with what I was <unk> in <unk> .
The <unk> of <unk> in life , people don 't know that <unk> the <unk> that these <unk> <unk> .
And this <unk> less <unk> , even when the results are good .
No one in the world of the <unk> world .
Because if I <unk> it , I don 't know what I 'm talking about .
The <unk> <unk> to this .
" It was better when he was worse , " The reason he was the best when he was <unk> was <unk> when he was <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
<unk> , in the world that we live -- <unk> citizens with the <unk> of the <unk> -- the <unk> that we can <unk> is that things are <unk> .
You 've never never <unk> <unk> because your <unk> , my <unk> , <unk> are <unk> .
The <unk> of happiness -- what you 're here -- is , " <unk> <unk> " Yes , you want to you . "
I mean -- small moment , I 'm really <unk> , and my wife is really <unk> .
I could not have to do better , I didn 't know .
But <unk> is not always a <unk> thing .
<unk> , a <unk> of buy a couple of <unk> <unk> when there is just that kind of <unk> is that when you 're not <unk> , and I 'm going to tell you , " Why ? "
" Who is <unk> ? " " " " <unk> is <unk> .
The world is the <unk> . What could you do ?
When are hundreds of kinds of <unk> <unk> , and you get a <unk> , and you 're going to <unk> who is <unk> , <unk> that the <unk> is , the <unk> that the <unk> you are you .
It could do better .
With hundreds of <unk> <unk> available , there are no <unk> for <unk> .
So when people get decisions , even though the result is <unk> , they <unk> <unk> and they <unk> their same .
In the last <unk> , the <unk> <unk> in the world .
I think a <unk> <unk> -- not the only , but important -- of this <unk> of <unk> is just that people have <unk> <unk> experience because the <unk> are too <unk> .
And when they have to <unk> this situation think that <unk> is them .
So the final result is that in general , we 're better , but we 'll be worse .
I 'm going to tell you .
This is the <unk> <unk> , what we all take for good and it 's completely <unk> . It 's not true .
There 's no <unk> that a little bit better than a little bit better than that , but from this is not <unk> that much choice is better than a little bit better .
There 's a <unk> value , <unk> . I don 't know what it is .
But I 'm quite sure we have <unk> from a piece of level the level where the choices <unk> our life .
Now , from the <unk> <unk> <unk> -- I 've been <unk> -- from the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> is the <unk> .
What allows you to do all this choice in the <unk> society is the <unk> material .
There are a lot of places in the world , and you know , where the problem is not that they have choice .
The problem is that they have too <unk> .
So the <unk> I 'm talking about is a <unk> <unk> of <unk> , <unk> society .
And what <unk> does is <unk> and <unk> is this : <unk> <unk> <unk> you about how those <unk> and <unk> for <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> . It 's a <unk> of money .
I mean that these choices , <unk> and <unk> , is not just <unk> .
They are <unk> <unk> .
They do it worse .
If a little bit about what in our society is <unk> to <unk> to be <unk> in those where people have too few , it would not be their life , but also our life .
This is what <unk> call a <unk> <unk> .
A <unk> of the income income is good for all -- not only the poor -- because of this choice in <unk> that <unk> us .
And to end , " <unk> , you can become everything you want to --
<unk> , people of culture , <unk> : " What do you know that fish ? "
" It 's <unk> that can 't get anything in a <unk> of glass . "
" A <unk> <unk> <unk> , a <unk> view of the world --
And I <unk> it , and I <unk> it , at the beginning .
But then , <unk> , I <unk> , I realized that fish knows that the long <unk> knows .
Because the reality of <unk> is that if you <unk> the <unk> , the way that 's all possible is possible . It 's not <unk> the freedom . You can 't <unk> the freedom .
If you <unk> the <unk> in the way that everything we can <unk> the <unk> .
<unk> the <unk> , and <unk> the <unk> .
They all need a <unk> .
This is almost <unk> too <unk> , maybe even for the fish , and it 's <unk> for us .
But the <unk> of some <unk> <unk> is a <unk> for <unk> and , for <unk> , for <unk> .
Thank you .
