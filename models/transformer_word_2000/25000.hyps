<unk> year I showed these <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> , which for almost three million years has had the size of the <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And we <unk> this <unk> the <unk> of the problem because it 's not <unk> the <unk> of the ice .
The <unk> <unk> <unk> is , in a sense , <unk> heart <unk> of global warming system .
It <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
The next <unk> will be a <unk> <unk> <unk> on the last 25 years .
The <unk> <unk> are <unk> in red .
As you see , it 's <unk> down to the blue <unk> .
That 's the ice in <unk> , which is <unk> in summer .
You can see that the <unk> ice <unk> , five years or more , it 's like blood , which here is <unk> from the body .
It 's been <unk> over to that , in 25 years .
This is a problem because <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> around the ocean <unk> , where there are huge <unk> of <unk> that , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> in <unk> <unk> .
<unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> , that amount of <unk> could <unk> , that <unk> <unk> .
In some <unk> <unk> , it 's already <unk> by the water .
The <unk> <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> ! <unk> : She 's good . The question is if we <unk> it .
One reason is that this <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
This is a <unk> river <unk> .
The <unk> had never <unk> <unk> <unk> .
This is the <unk> <unk> , in the <unk> of <unk> .
If you want to know how the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> on <unk> <unk> , on the <unk> <unk> , here is where the sea .
These <unk> are <unk> <unk> .
On the other side of the planet : <unk> , the largest <unk> of ice on the planet .
<unk> last month , <unk> scientists that the <unk> of the ice is in <unk> , and that <unk> <unk> on some <unk> <unk> , is particularly <unk> in <unk> .
<unk> at six feet of the <unk> , like in <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> of ice , <unk> new <unk> , which a few years ago were <unk> .
<unk> percent of the world 's population <unk> water from that <unk> .
<unk> <unk> : This <unk> is the <unk> of <unk> water .
<unk> is <unk> .
But when we <unk> , the same happens to the <unk> water .
<unk> <unk> <unk> is 40 percent <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> are in crisis .
The <unk> , as you read , are <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> in the world <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> are <unk> to a <unk> outside the normal and <unk> .
<unk> times more <unk> over the last 30 years than <unk> <unk> .
This is a <unk> of all <unk> .
If you look at it in the <unk> context , if you can see the <unk> .
In the last five years , we 've <unk> 70 million <unk> of CO2 <unk> every 24 hours -- 25 million <unk> in the oceans .
<unk> <unk> the area of the <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and both of the <unk> <unk> <unk> , where there 's a <unk> <unk> of oxygen in the ocean .
The <unk> of the global <unk> , together with <unk> , which is 20 percent , <unk> use use of <unk> <unk> .
<unk> is a problem , and <unk> is even worse .
The United States is one of the most <unk> <unk> , together with China .
And it 's <unk> to build a lot of other <unk> <unk> .
But we 're <unk> to a <unk> of direction .
These are the <unk> projects over the last few years and some <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
<unk> , there 's a <unk> political <unk> in our country .
The <unk> of <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> million dollars in the last year to <unk> <unk> <unk> , which is a <unk> .
I 'm going to give me something --
<unk> <unk> , in <unk> , where I live , there was a <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> .
Maybe you saw it on the <unk> .
This is the second largest flow of <unk> in America .
It happened around <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> of one of the <unk> <unk> was this .
<unk> : <unk> ♫ ♫ <unk> <unk> is a <unk> and happy <unk> .
It 's <unk> here in America , and it makes our economy .
<unk> <unk> is <unk> <unk> .
It 's <unk> , <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> it .
<unk> <unk> : <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The largest <unk> society on the <unk> is <unk> <unk> . This is his <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> <unk> -- <unk> -- Al <unk> , <unk> <unk> -- not know what they 're talking about .
<unk> <unk> : So <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
This is one of them , a <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> : <unk> <unk> we see the <unk> changes as a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
So , for that , is a big amount of money in a <unk> <unk> <unk> to make public public and <unk> the <unk> truth of <unk> .
In fact , <unk> is not <unk> .
We think it 's <unk> -- it 's also a good <unk> .
So we don 't <unk> of climate change .
We should do it .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> -- <unk> -- you 've heard about it very much .
So , we 're going to <unk> a <unk> in a <unk> <unk> for <unk> .
<unk> ! The cars are a little <unk> , but this is the sound of <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> is between the <unk> <unk> of global <unk> , but the <unk> technology <unk> that you see everything .
<unk> a look : This is the <unk> technology of <unk> <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to the economic issue and national security security .
<unk> : <unk> America is in crisis ; the <unk> , national security crisis .
The <unk> that <unk> all : our <unk> <unk> <unk> , like <unk> and oil <unk> .
Now , there 's a new , <unk> solution to <unk> it .
<unk> America : 100 percent of <unk> energy , in 10 years .
A plan to <unk> America at work , more <unk> <unk> , and help <unk> global warming .
<unk> , a solution that we can solve our problems .
<unk> America . <unk> more .
<unk> <unk> : This is the last one .
<unk> : <unk> : It 's about <unk> energy to America .
One of the most <unk> ways of <unk> to <unk> <unk> that <unk> our planet .
<unk> : The future is here . <unk> , <unk> , <unk> new <unk> network .
<unk> <unk> 2 : <unk> <unk> for jobs .
<unk> : <unk> America . It 's time to be <unk> .
<unk> <unk> : A old <unk> <unk> says , " If you want to go to alone .
If you want to go back to the <unk> .
We need to go far away , quickly .
Thank you very much .
<unk> year at TED I did an <unk> <unk> .
And I 'm going to try to <unk> how the car works .
So here we . And for the ones that the other time there were no , the <unk> is the largest scientific experiment ever <unk> -- <unk> miles of <unk> .
His job is to <unk> the conditions that were in less than a <unk> <unk> <unk> from the beginning of the universe -- until <unk> million times a second .
This is just <unk> .
This is the machine under <unk> .
We <unk> these <unk> <unk> inside the <unk> .
This is what I work . It 's called <unk> -- it 's <unk> feet , and it 's <unk> feet .
This is an <unk> picture of <unk> <unk> in <unk> , so you can see <unk> .
<unk> <unk> last year , we <unk> the car for the first time .
And this picture was <unk> by <unk> .
It was <unk> <unk> in control .
It 's an image of the first <unk> of particles that had done all <unk> <unk> , <unk> in <unk> , with a part of the <unk> , and <unk> particles inside the <unk> .
In other words , when you look at that picture the <unk> <unk> , I realized that the <unk> machine , which is a big <unk> .
I don 't know if it was to make us <unk> more or that , when someone <unk> on Google and <unk> that page was this .
That means that we had a <unk> impact beyond that scientific .
<unk> a week later , there was a problem with the car , <unk> to these <unk> here -- these <unk> <unk> .
These <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> when the car works at the <unk> <unk> .
Now , the <unk> between you <unk> <unk> and <unk> , " It 's not true . It 's too <unk> .
And they can do that because when they 're very <unk> to get the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
So , <unk> degrees <unk> degrees , at a temperature <unk> at the <unk> of space between the stars , these <unk> can bring that <unk> .
In one of the <unk> of <unk> <unk> in the <unk> , there was a <unk> <unk> .
So the <unk> <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a electric <unk> .
This was the result .
Now , this is even more <unk> if you think that these <unk> <unk> <unk> over 20 <unk> , and that 's <unk> about 30 <unk> .
It 's about 50 <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , what we did .
We <unk> them and <unk> .
Now they 're all <unk> to their <unk> .
<unk> the end of <unk> the <unk> will be again again .
We <unk> it , and we try to get data to <unk> or <unk> , and so on our <unk> to discover what are the <unk> that are <unk> the universe .
Now , of course , in some ways , these <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> of science and engineering engineering . It 's easy to <unk> .
I think that it 's so hard , the fact that it 's <unk> to go beyond <unk> , I think is this the value of things like <unk> .
I want to end with the words of a <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , which , in <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of his <unk> , his <unk> was Michael <unk> , said , " It 's not <unk> <unk> for the progress of human mind mind as the ideas that we <unk> are <unk> , and there are no new <unk> .
Thank you .
I want to start <unk> to <unk> to when , as children , <unk> <unk> .
<unk> like <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> , and <unk> , really , really , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> is <unk> <unk> to the way that most of the world around us .
So , from <unk> <unk> from the <unk> of our <unk> with <unk> <unk> , and my <unk> <unk> <unk> , and my <unk> <unk> <unk> , I started <unk> : " And if , when we use a computer , instead of having the <unk> <unk> as digital <unk> as digital <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> information with both with both hands ,
and <unk> to our <unk> ?
The question was so interesting that I decided that I wanted to explore the answer , building <unk> .
In a few words , a <unk> is a computer <unk> as a <unk> .
In a few words , a <unk> is a computer <unk> as a <unk> .
You can <unk> it with your hand , they can <unk> <unk> between them , feel the <unk> movement and they have a screen and have a <unk> radio .
But <unk> , they 're <unk> objects , like <unk> , you can just <unk> <unk> .
<unk> are the <unk> of a new tools of tools to <unk> digital information .
And as they become more <unk> , <unk> of the movement , other , and as they become <unk> , <unk> of the other , <unk> , <unk> of the other , of how we <unk> them , and we can explore and <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Let 's start with some simple example .
This <unk> is <unk> <unk> to show : if you <unk> it in a direction , the video will be <unk> like this , if you go on the other side back .
These <unk> <unk> are <unk> of others .
If you <unk> them , you 're <unk> to what they 're going to happen .
If they come <unk> , and they can <unk> it and they can <unk> it a little bit .
If they come <unk> , and they can <unk> it and they can <unk> it a little bit .
They also <unk> their movement and <unk> .
And then we realized that one of the interesting <unk> of the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> that we can use common data on the <unk> of data , for example , <unk> <unk> , a color like it was a <unk> .
In this case , we have three <unk> <unk> as a <unk> <unk> <unk> , and I can <unk> to <unk> color in the central where it is .
and I can <unk> it to <unk> color in the central where it is .
If we <unk> it too much , we can make it a little bit of a <unk> .
There are also <unk> possibilities of <unk> , like <unk> , <unk> and <unk> where people can try things things very quickly , and <unk> the results immediately .
Now , I 'm --
This is a <unk> sequence I do with a <unk> program .
Here we have a <unk> game that 's <unk> between <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> , at every <unk> <unk> a letter in <unk> , <unk> , every <unk> , <unk> , every <unk> <unk> a letter on every <unk> , and while I was <unk> in <unk> , and while I was <unk> on a <unk> .
Then , after about 30 seconds , you get to <unk> , and you have a new <unk> of <unk> and new possibilities to try .
Thank you .
Here 's <unk> children in <unk> at <unk> <unk> , I made it in a way that I put them and I <unk> a video .
They 're very <unk> .
And one of the interesting things of <unk> is that you don 't have to give people many <unk> .
I just said , " <unk> of words , " and they know what to do .
Here 's other people who <unk> it .
This is our <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , there 's the <unk> .
It really wanted to <unk> .
They were just <unk> , for him .
Now , this is an <unk> <unk> <unk> .
It 's going to build a tool for the <unk> of the <unk> . He 's <unk> .
It can <unk> new characters in the scene , <unk> their <unk> .
It can <unk> new characters in the scene , <unk> their <unk> .
So here 's what it 's doing .
<unk> : The sun is <unk> .
David <unk> : Now it 's taken a <unk> in the scene .
<unk> : The <unk> <unk> .
<unk> work ! Yes !
So , <unk> <unk> and <unk> can <unk> the characters --
<unk> : <unk> !
-- I 'll tell you about your own story .
<unk> : <unk> !
<unk> : It 's a story with final final , and it can decide how to do it .
<unk> : It 's a story with final final , and it can decide how to do it .
<unk> : <unk> . <unk> .
<unk> : The last example I have time to show you is a <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> music .
It 's a recent tool that has made for <unk> and <unk> music .
The <unk> here are <unk> as basic , bottom and the <unk> .
<unk> of these has four different <unk> , and you can choose which to use .
You can also <unk> these <unk> in a sequence of <unk> to your <unk> .
And they just <unk> a <unk> <unk> a " sound " and a <unk> sequence . "
These are effects that you can control live , like <unk> and <unk> .
I 'll <unk> it to a particular sound and then <unk> to <unk> it .
And then there are the effects of time , and <unk> , which <unk> the entire sequence .
<unk> how it works .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Now , we 're going to have a <unk> line .
<unk> : <unk> : Now , <unk> <unk> .
<unk> : And now I 'm going to <unk> the <unk> , so I can control the effect of alive .
<unk> : <unk> : I can <unk> the entire sequence <unk> time on one side or another .
<unk> : And now we <unk> the <unk> to give more <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> : I can <unk> the sequence " flight . "
So I don 't have to <unk> before , but I can <unk> it , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
And now , finally , I can <unk> the entire <unk> <unk> on the left <unk> <unk> .
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is to build new <unk> <unk> <unk> to how our brain work and body .
And today , I had time to show you one of the results of this path , and some <unk> that we 're trying to bring out of the lab .
The concept that I want to <unk> is that 's <unk> this new generation of <unk> objects to <unk> with the <unk> media , that <unk> information in our world in the way we want .
Thank you very much .
I don 't see the time of talking to all of you .
I 'm a <unk> .
<unk> books is my <unk> , but it 's more than that , of course .
It 's also love and <unk> of my life .
And I don 't expect that to change .
But , I said , something particular happened in my life and career , and that <unk> me to <unk> the whole relationship with this work .
The particular thing is that I <unk> wrote this book , this <unk> called " <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
And the result is that everywhere I 'm <unk> now , people <unk> me as if I was <unk> .
<unk> -- <unk> , <unk> !
<unk> to me now all <unk> and say , " You don 't <unk> to be able to do better ?
You don 't fear to keep writing for all of life that could be able to create a book that could <unk> to <unk> to someone ? "
that can you get to someone ? "
It 's <unk> , you know .
But it could go worse , <unk> , <unk> that I remember over 20 years ago , when I started to say people -- I was a <unk> -- I wanted to be a <unk> .
It 's going to be <unk> <unk> from fear .
And people say , " Don 't you know I couldn 't get successful ?
You don 't fear that the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> ?
You don 't fear to do this <unk> all of life without <unk> that nothing is ever <unk> and <unk> on a <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> 's <unk> <unk> 's mouth ?
So , you know .
The answer -- the short answer to all these questions is , " Yes . "
Yeah , I fear all of those things .
I 've always had fear .
And I fear of many other things that people couldn 't <unk> .
Like <unk> and other things <unk> .
But , as it is to write what I thought and <unk> is why ?
Is it <unk> ?
It 's <unk> that anyone who <unk> <unk> to be <unk> by a job that you feel born to do .
But what 's so particular in the <unk> <unk> <unk> to <unk> health <unk> <unk> in a way that other <unk> do not ?
Like my father , for example , he was a <unk> <unk> and I didn 't remember once in his <unk> years of activity where he was asked if she was afraid to be <unk> <unk> ?
It had never -- that <unk> of <unk> John , how is it going ?
<unk> 't we <unk> it , <unk> ?
<unk> , the engineers <unk> as a group of certainly , in <unk> , <unk> the <unk> of being <unk> <unk> .
We <unk> , we have enough this <unk> , and not only <unk> <unk> , but <unk> of all of this <unk> to be <unk> <unk> .
And he 's not <unk> that looking at the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> that , only in the <unk> century , <unk> young and often for them .
And the ones that don 't have <unk> to be really <unk> by their <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , before you die , in the last <unk> said , " Every <unk> my book , <unk> me a little <unk> about the work of their lives .
But we didn 't know when we <unk> to say , because we 've heard these things so long that somehow we <unk> , and so we <unk> it completely <unk> and <unk> the <unk> that creativity and <unk> are in some way that <unk> and <unk> , art , at the end , <unk> .
And the question I want to <unk> to all here is : are you agree with this idea ?
It 's OK . It 's going to be <unk> by a <unk> <unk> <unk> to me .
I think it 's <unk> .
And I think it 's <unk> , and I don 't want to <unk> <unk> in the next century .
I think it 's better <unk> our big <unk> to live .
And certainly I know that , in my case -- it would be very <unk> to start <unk> to that <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> in which I 'm in my career .
<unk> -- look at it , I 'm quite young , I have about 40 years old .
I still have about four <unk> <unk> in me .
And it 's very <unk> that anything that <unk> thing in <unk> , it will be <unk> by the world , like the work that I 'll be <unk> after the <unk> success of my last book .
<unk> <unk> , because we 're all <unk> <unk> here -- is <unk> that my greatest success is to my <unk> .
Oh , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> !
You know , this is the kind of thinking that leads a person to start <unk> <unk> to the nine <unk> in the morning , and I don 't want to do it .
I should continue doing this work that I love .
So , the question becomes , how ?
And so it seems to me , after many <unk> , that the way to work to continue to write is what to create a <unk> <unk> <unk> , OK ?
I have to come in a few <unk> distance between me , which I 'm <unk> , and my natural <unk> on what <unk> <unk> is going to get . And as I was going to go through the time , we could find other society to find other society to see whether we had better ideas and find other society to see if you could have better ideas and find find other society to see if you could have better ideas and find find other society to see if you have better ideas to find find
about how to help people <unk> <unk> <unk> of creativity .
And that research has taken me to the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
It 's because it <unk> back and then <unk> back .
<unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> -- people don 't believe that creativity <unk> from men , OK ?
It <unk> that creativity was this <unk> spirit and <unk> to men from some <unk> <unk> and <unk> to <unk> , for the <unk> and <unk> , for reasons and <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> of these <unk> <unk> of creativity .
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> to have a <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> were the same idea , but they <unk> that sort of <unk> <unk> the spirit without a <unk> .
The <unk> is <unk> , because <unk> didn 't really feel like a <unk> was <unk> as smart .
And I thought a <unk> was this kind of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> literally in the <unk> of the study of a artist , a little <unk> like <unk> , and that <unk> out <unk> <unk> the work of the artist 's artist and <unk> the <unk> of that work .
<unk> <unk> <unk> you , that 's the distance of which I 'm talking about -- that <unk> <unk> you from the results of your work .
And everybody thought that was so that it was so that we were , right ?
So the <unk> artists were <unk> to <unk> things , like <unk> <unk> , right ?
If your work was <unk> not to be <unk> all the <unk> , all <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
If your work <unk> , it wasn 't all <unk> your <unk> , right ?
And everybody thought it was your <unk> to be a <unk> .
And so the people <unk> <unk> creativity <unk> for a long time .
And then the <unk> <unk> and all <unk> , and we <unk> this big idea ; we put the human being in the center of the universe above all of the <unk> and the <unk> and <unk> and <unk> space and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and all the <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and
This was the <unk> principle of <unk> <unk> and people started to think that creativity completely <unk> completely <unk> from <unk> .
And for the first time in history , it <unk> to <unk> this or the artist as a <unk> <unk> than a person with <unk> .
And I have to <unk> it , I think it was a big <unk> .
I think that 's a simple person to believe that they 're like a <unk> like the source , <unk> and the <unk> of all the <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and a <unk> responsibility to give to human <unk> .
It 's like <unk> to someone to <unk> the sun .
<unk> and completely <unk> the <unk> and create all these <unk> <unk> <unk> on the <unk> .
And I think it was this pressure to have <unk> artists in <unk> 500 years .
And if that 's true , and I think that 's true , and the question becomes , and now ?
Can we do that <unk> ?
We could get back to a more <unk> understanding of the relationship between humans and <unk> <unk> .
Or maybe not .
Maybe we can 't <unk> 500 years of thinking in an 18 minutes talk .
And there 's probably people in the audience who are <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> on the <unk> of , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> people <unk> <unk> on their projects .
You probably don 't tell all about this thing .
But the question I 'd like to say is -- why don 't it ?
Why not <unk> this way ?
Because it makes more sense of anything that I 've ever heard about to explain the <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
A process that , as anyone who ever <unk> to do something -- so basically , all of this is -- it 's not <unk> <unk> .
And in fact , it can sometimes be completely <unk> .
I did this <unk> <unk> with the amazing <unk> <unk> , who has now 90 years , but it was a <unk> for all of life and he said , in his <unk> <unk> , and he said , in his <unk> <unk> , <unk> out in the <unk> <unk> , <unk> out in the <unk> <unk> .
She said it was like a <unk> <unk> .
And that <unk> <unk> to her from <unk> .
I would <unk> it , because it was <unk> the land under its feet .
I decided to have one thing to do at that point and was , words , " <unk> like a <unk> . "
And he <unk> back to home and was <unk> by this <unk> , and it wouldn 't have to do anything that take a piece of paper and a <unk> enough <unk> , and <unk> enough to the <unk> , and <unk> and <unk> on the page .
<unk> times he couldn 't get enough enough , so <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> without being able to get home and <unk> it through and she would go to <unk> through and she would go through the <unk> , looking , as she said , " another <unk> . "
Then there were times -- this piece never <unk> it -- there were no <unk> of times when the <unk> was almost <unk> , right ?
So , he was <unk> home and he was looking for the <unk> and the <unk> through , and he <unk> a <unk> right in the while he was <unk> , and then he said , that was like if he <unk> with the other hand and <unk> .
He <unk> the <unk> from the tail and <unk> in his body and the <unk> on the page .
And in these cases , the <unk> would be <unk> on the <unk> page and <unk> but <unk> , the <unk> <unk> to the last word to the first .
So when I <unk> it -- it 's <unk> , it 's exactly <unk> to my <unk> process .
Not my <unk> process -- I 'm not a <unk> !
I 'm a <unk> , and my way of <unk> is ; I <unk> it every day and work and <unk> and <unk> on top of the <unk> .
But even me in my <unk> , I <unk> against that thing , sometimes .
And I knew that many of you <unk> that 's done .
You know , even if the work and ideas , I would <unk> <unk> by a source , I couldn 't <unk> <unk> .
And what is this thing ?
And how can we <unk> it in a way we don 't have to be <unk> , but rather , that <unk> us ?
<unk> <unk> , the best example I <unk> that I have is the <unk> <unk> <unk> , which I 've been different years ago for a <unk> .
I was talking about this , and you know , <unk> , for the <unk> of life was the <unk> of the <unk> artist <unk> <unk> , trying to control , <unk> , <unk> these <unk> <unk> <unk> .
But then he <unk> , he <unk> , and he was <unk> on a <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> everything for him .
It 's going fast and everything of a <unk> <unk> , and it 's going to be <unk> fast , and it takes on it as a <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , and you know , you know , wonderful , and the <unk> , but he doesn 't know how to <unk> it .
It doesn 't have a <unk> of paper , it doesn 't have a <unk> .
So he starts to hear this kind of old <unk> to grow in him , " I 'm going to lose , and <unk> <unk> from this song .
I 'm not <unk> enough , and I can 't <unk> enough . "
And instead of going to <unk> , they <unk> .
And we had the entire <unk> process and <unk> something completely new .
It just <unk> the sky and said , " <unk> , don 't you see I 'm <unk> ? "
" It seems to be <unk> a song now ?
If you really want to <unk> , <unk> in a <unk> moment , when I can take care of you .
<unk> , <unk> to <unk> another today .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . "
And his <unk> process after this .
Not the work , the work was still <unk> .
But the process , and the <unk> <unk> that <unk> was <unk> when <unk> the <unk> , the <unk> that <unk> out of him , he had to be <unk> anything that has been <unk> and <unk> back from where it was not to be a <unk> and <unk> .
But I would <unk> this <unk> , wonderful <unk> , <unk> a conversation with <unk> and this thing <unk> and <unk> , but it wasn 't <unk> .
So , how much <unk> history is to change a little bit of the way I 'll be able to <unk> me and already <unk> me once .
This idea , I was <unk> when I was <unk> , " <unk> , <unk> , " and <unk> in one of the <unk> <unk> that we all are working on something and you don 't get to think that a <unk> , that 's going to be the <unk> book .
Not just <unk> , right now , right ?
And we start thinking about <unk> this project .
But then I <unk> <unk> that <unk> in the air and <unk> us .
So I put my face in the <unk> and <unk> my <unk> at a corner of the room .
And I said to <unk> , " <unk> , what , both of us , we know that if this book is not going to be <unk> my , right ?
Because as you see I 'm <unk> everything I have , I don 't have more than that .
So if you want it to be better , you have to <unk> and do your side .
OK . But if you don 't do that , you know what , I don 't do .
And I started writing the same because it 's my work .
And I would like you to be <unk> that I 've been <unk> to do my <unk> . " Because it 's so , OK -- <unk> -- it 's in the <unk> of the North Africa <unk> people <unk> to <unk> the <unk> <unk> at the <unk> <unk> <unk> , music that <unk> <unk> hours to <unk> .
And they were always <unk> , because the <unk> were <unk> and they were <unk> .
But every <unk> , <unk> , something <unk> , and one of these <unk> artists actually <unk> .
And I know you know what I 'm going to talk about , because I know you all have seen at some point , a <unk> like this .
It was like the time , and the <unk> <unk> through a kind of <unk> , and it wasn 't doing anything different from usually <unk> , like the <unk> <unk> first , but everything is <unk> .
And all of a sudden not just human <unk> .
But it <unk> out of the <unk> and under <unk> in the fire of the <unk> .
And when this <unk> , at the time , people <unk> what was , he <unk> it with his name .
<unk> your hands and <unk> to <unk> , " <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , God , God , " God . "
That 's God , you know .
<unk> <unk> -- when the <unk> <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> , I had this <unk> with them and the <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , " <unk> , " <unk> , " <unk> , " which you can hear in the <unk> or in <unk> .
In <unk> , when an artist did something impossible and <unk> , " <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , " <unk> , <unk> -- a <unk> of God .
And it 's <unk> because we need it .
But the problem comes after day , for the <unk> itself , when you <unk> and <unk> that are 11 <unk> of <unk> and <unk> <unk> of God is no more .
It 's just a <unk> <unk> <unk> , and maybe you never <unk> to <unk> <unk> .
And maybe no one <unk> the name of God still <unk> , and what 's so it has to do with the rest of his life ?
It 's hard .
This is one of the most <unk> <unk> to do in a <unk> life .
But maybe it 's not to be so <unk> if you can 't believe , <unk> , <unk> the most <unk> of your being come from you .
But let me just <unk> you go <unk> from a <unk> source of this <unk> part of your life that you have to go to <unk> another when you 're done .
And , you know , if we think it all change .
And so I started <unk> , and it 's certainly as I <unk> it for several months in the <unk> of the book that I would be <unk> , <unk> of my <unk> .
And what I have to continue <unk> when I feel <unk> from this is , I don 't fear .
It 's not going to be <unk> .
<unk> <unk> for your side , whatever it can be .
If your work is <unk> , <unk> .
If the <unk> , you 'll be <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> some <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> some kind of <unk> , for one moment through your <unk> , " <unk> ! "
<unk> , you do the same your <unk> .
And " <unk> ! " <unk> to you .
I think , and I think it <unk> <unk> .
" <unk> ! " <unk> ! " <unk> , " only for <unk> love love and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Thank you .
Thank you .
<unk> <unk> : <unk> !
As you know , I 've talked about some of these projects on the human genome , what can <unk> and <unk> about the discovery of new genes .
Now we 're <unk> a new <unk> <unk> : we started <unk> biology and now starting from that digital code , we 're <unk> in a new <unk> of biology , <unk> and <unk> and <unk> .
We always tried to ask big questions .
" What is life ? " It 's something that many <unk> , I think have <unk> to <unk> at various levels .
We 've been <unk> , <unk> to the <unk> terms .
We 're <unk> for almost 20 years now .
When we <unk> the human genome <unk> to go from the world <unk> of biology in the world of the digital world of the computer .
Now , we can <unk> the life , or create new life on this digital universe ?
This is the map of a little <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> , which is the species from the <unk> genome of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> genome between the <unk> of the <unk> genome , which is the species from the <unk> genome between
And we tried to reduce <unk> the genome to <unk> one even smaller .
We can <unk> a <unk> of <unk> of <unk> that 's about 500 genes that are here .
But when we take a look at his <unk> map , it 's <unk> simple than our .
<unk> , this is simple .
But when we look at all the genes that we can <unk> , one at the time , is very <unk> that this can bring to a <unk> cell .
So I thought the only way to <unk> was <unk> this <unk> so that they could <unk> <unk> the <unk> to <unk> some of these questions .
And so we started the <unk> of " <unk> . " We <unk> a <unk> <unk> ? "
Can the chemistry <unk> of these big molecules that we 've never been able to create before now ?
And in case , can we make a <unk> ?
A <unk> is just a piece of <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The speed with which we 're able to <unk> life is <unk> to <unk> <unk> .
Our ability to write the <unk> code , instead of <unk> slowly , but it 's <unk> .
And our most <unk> results that <unk> <unk> on a <unk> <unk> .
We 've been over 15 years ago .
The process has <unk> a lot of <unk> , <unk> with a <unk> <unk> <unk> before <unk> experiments .
But we found that DNA <unk> is very difficult .
There are <unk> of thousands of cars in the world that <unk> little <unk> of DNA , of 30 to 50 <unk> and it 's a <unk> process : <unk> is <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
So we had to develop a new <unk> to <unk> these <unk> and <unk> the <unk> .
And this was our first <unk> <unk> , starting to be digital information of <unk> <unk> <unk> 's <unk> .
It 's a little virus that bacteria <unk> bacteria .
We designed <unk> , <unk> the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> a DNA <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
The interesting part of it is when we took this piece of <unk> <unk> material , and we <unk> it in bacteria , bacteria have <unk> to read this code and <unk> particles .
The <unk> particles are <unk> back , and they 're <unk> back and they <unk> the <unk> <unk> .
I talked about recently with members of the <unk> <unk> <unk> that they have certainly <unk> this model .
They <unk> more than you .
And I think this is a situation where the software can really build its own <unk> in a <unk> system .
But we wanted to do the largest thing in the big .
We had to build the entire <unk> <unk> .
They 're more than <unk> <unk> <unk> .
So we thought I would <unk> to <unk> the size of the virus , so that we can change the <unk> to understand what the <unk> of a <unk> cell .
<unk> is <unk> , and if you <unk> information with <unk> in a computer , these must be very <unk> .
When we <unk> this genome for the first time in <unk> , the standard <unk> was of a <unk> for every 10 <unk> <unk> .
We found , <unk> , 30 <unk> . If we were <unk> that original <unk> <unk> never been able to do it work .
One of the process is to design <unk> 50 <unk> <unk> that <unk> with all the other <unk> <unk> of <unk> to build smaller <unk> <unk> that <unk> together .
<unk> elements here .
You probably read that <unk> us of the <unk> .
<unk> <unk> : We have a <unk> code on four <unk> : A , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> of those <unk> <unk> together <unk> about 20 <unk> , and there 's a <unk> order of <unk> every <unk> .
So we can use the <unk> code to write words , <unk> , <unk> .
What we 've done at at first is <unk> .
Some of them were <unk> by the fact that it was not <unk> .
We designed these <unk> to <unk> just <unk> <unk> with <unk> .
There are <unk> that <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
And we started <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
In every step we made these <unk> in <unk> so that we 're <unk> to make it <unk> that we 're <unk> to create a extremely <unk> <unk> , which we see in a minute .
We 're trying to <unk> the process .
So this looks like the <unk> of a <unk> <unk> .
When you get to these <unk> very <unk> , much of 100 <unk> <unk> , you don 't have to be <unk> directly in the <unk> <unk> .
It 's <unk> <unk> of the <unk> tools of <unk> biology .
So we 've <unk> other <unk> .
<unk> of another <unk> called <unk> , which is in biology <unk> to <unk> DNA <unk> DNA <unk> .
Here 's an example .
This <unk> , called <unk> <unk> , can <unk> three million <unk> <unk> .
You can see in the <unk> <unk> like his <unk> is <unk> .
<unk> -- in 12 -- it 's <unk> exactly like it was before .
<unk> thousands of organisms that can be able to do that .
These organisms can completely <unk> .
It will live under <unk> .
I 'm absolutely sure that life <unk> in space , and it <unk> to find new <unk> of water <unk> .
In fact , NASA <unk> that this is happening .
This is an image of the <unk> that we 've built these <unk> , just using these <unk> <unk> with <unk> design <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> <unk> .
This picture was not <unk> with a <unk> <unk> , but with a <unk> <unk> .
It 's such a big <unk> that we can <unk> with a <unk> <unk> .
These are pictures that <unk> a <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> .
This is the <unk> that we 've done a little bit of time ago .
They 're more than <unk> <unk> .
It 's the largest <unk> of a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
It has a <unk> weight <unk> <unk> to 300 million .
If you <unk> it with a <unk> 10 <unk> , we 'll have only pages to <unk> this <unk> code .
Now , how do we make it work ? How can we <unk> it ?
<unk> , through a virus is a <unk> game .
It 's a little bit more <unk> when you use of bacteria .
It 's <unk> even when it 's about <unk> cells , like our : you can just <unk> the <unk> and <unk> another , which is that basically the <unk> process .
In <unk> , the <unk> is <unk> in the cell , but we <unk> <unk> <unk> that we are able to make a <unk> <unk> <unk> of a cell <unk> to another cell <unk> .
We <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> from a <unk> species .
<unk> are different as men from <unk> .
We 've <unk> some <unk> in more <unk> that we could decide which to choose what to do to do with this <unk> .
And then he <unk> it with the <unk> so that we <unk> all the <unk> .
And when we put it in the cell <unk> , and we <unk> our <unk> the new <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> into the cell .
And we had to <unk> that we didn 't have to go beyond , but we tried to <unk> more <unk> in there .
This is one of the major <unk> of evolution .
We found that <unk> species <unk> a second or a third <unk> somewhere , <unk> , <unk> in a second thousands of new <unk> to that species .
So who think about evolution as one <unk> at a time that <unk> has no <unk> of biology .
<unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> that was in the cell <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> that we <unk> <unk> .
It 's <unk> , and it <unk> the other <unk> as a <unk> material , and it 's <unk> with only cell and the new <unk> .
has become blue because of the genes that we <unk> .
And in a short <unk> of time , all the <unk> of a species are <unk> <unk> , and it 's <unk> all in a new kind of <unk> , <unk> on the new software that we have <unk> in the cell .
All the <unk> are <unk> , and when we <unk> the code <unk> <unk> exactly to what we 've <unk> you 've <unk> .
Now , this may seem <unk> <unk> , but by <unk> the software , we can change things in a pretty <unk> way .
Now , I 've already <unk> that 's not about <unk> -- but in progress from three million years and a half million years of evolution , and I said that maybe we 're going to create a new version of <unk> <unk> that <unk> new species on this digital <unk> .
Why do that ?
I think it 's pretty <unk> when we think of our <unk> .
We 're going to go from six and a half billion people to <unk> billion in the next 40 years .
Just to give an example : I was born in <unk> .
Now there are three people on the planet to <unk> <unk> in <unk> ; there 's 40 years , there 's going to be four .
We 're <unk> problems now to find food , <unk> water and <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> for six billion people .
We 're going to make that nine billion .
<unk> more than five billion <unk> , more than 30 billion <unk> <unk> .
That means 100 million <unk> a day .
When we try to find <unk> <unk> , or any <unk> of <unk> process to <unk> , it will be a huge challenge .
In more we have to realize all the CO2 <unk> from these materials that <unk> in the atmosphere .
At the day , because of the <unk> <unk> around the world , we have a <unk> with about 20 million genes , and I like to think that are the <unk> <unk> for the future .
The <unk> <unk> only one <unk> about <unk> , and think about how many different things are <unk> out .
Our <unk> here is <unk> data from <unk> reality .
Now we have <unk> , because of these <unk> <unk> <unk> , able to create what we call <unk> <unk> .
We can make a big robot that can produce a million <unk> a day .
Think of <unk> these 20 million different genes or <unk> to <unk> the <unk> to make <unk> or <unk> , new <unk> , can change , because of a small team , and create more biology now that we have a little team , and create more biology now that in the last 20 years of science .
And it 's just a standard <unk> .
We can choose to <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
This is a <unk> of some software <unk> that we 're working on to be able to <unk> and design species on the computer .
Well , we don 't know how they 're going to be .
We know exactly what their <unk> code is .
Now we 're <unk> on the <unk> generation of <unk> .
You 've seen that <unk> <unk> from <unk> was an experiment .
We have <unk> second and third generation that we had enough to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , like <unk> or different kinds of <unk> .
But the only way that biology can have a big impact without <unk> <unk> the cost of food and <unk> the <unk> would be <unk> the CO2 in matter , so we 're working for cells that we 're working in the first <unk> generation , and we think we have the first <unk> <unk> in about 18 months .
The solar light <unk> with CO2 is a <unk> , but in our <unk> <unk> in our <unk> around the world , we found different <unk> .
This is a <unk> that we <unk> in <unk> .
It <unk> in the deep ocean , about <unk> feet deep at the temperature of <unk> of water .
It <unk> <unk> from CO2 using hydrogen <unk> as energy source .
We 're trying to understand whether we can <unk> CO2 , that can easily be <unk> through <unk> , <unk> that CO2 in <unk> , to drive this process .
So , in the short we think that we could be able to <unk> what the basic question of " What is life " is us , " is we , we , we have the <unk> goal of <unk> the entire <unk> industry .
<unk> . If you can 't do it from TED , where you can ?
<unk> a <unk> of energy .
<unk> , we 're working for using the same <unk> to create <unk> .
You saw this year with flu , we 're always <unk> back a year and with a dollar in less when it 's about finding the right <unk> .
I think that 's what you can change is <unk> <unk> .
So here 's how the future could start to look <unk> , now , the tree of evolution , <unk> bacteria with <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and then cells <unk> cells .
We 're in so on <unk> people .
Our purpose is to make a <unk> enough to try to <unk> it . Thank you very much .
First of all I 'll show you , the <unk> possible , some <unk> work , some <unk> of the new technology that we 've taken at <unk> <unk> to a <unk> almost a year ago . This is <unk> .
It 's a environment that you can <unk> is at local level that <unk> with a huge amount of data .
Here we 're seeing <unk> <unk> <unk> with a kind of <unk> <unk> and <unk> , for a fast <unk> , <unk> the images like we want .
And it doesn 't matter how much information is that we see , how much it is these <unk> of data , or images .
Most of them are common photographs , but this is a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> in the <unk> of 300 <unk> .
It doesn 't make any difference because the only thing that <unk> the <unk> of a system like this is the number of <unk> on your screen at any time . It 's also a very <unk> architecture .
This is a whole book , example of <unk> <unk> .
This is the <unk> <unk> <unk> . Every <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And to say it 's just about it and not images of the <unk> , we can do something like that , to actually see that it 's a real <unk> of the text <unk> , not of a picture .
It could be a little <unk> to read a little <unk> .
I don 't tell you .
This is an <unk> example . It 's a more <unk> example .
Every single image is the beginning of a <unk> .
And it really gives you the pleasure experience of reading the true <unk> version of a <unk> or a <unk> , which is for nature a <unk> kind of a <unk> <unk> .
We also have something with the corner of this particular number , particularly <unk> .
We created a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> much more than what you use in a normal <unk> , and we 've <unk> <unk> content .
If you want to see the <unk> of this <unk> , you can see it here .
Or even other models , or even <unk> <unk> .
And this really <unk> some of these ideas to <unk> the <unk> of space on the screen .
And we 'll see that <unk> to put in the <unk> and other <unk> <unk> , no longer to be <unk> .
Of course , <unk> is one of the most <unk> <unk> for this kind of technology .
And I don 't want to lose time , if we don 't say that we have <unk> <unk> to give it to this field .
These are all the streets in the United States <unk> on an <unk> image of NASA <unk> .
So now we 'll start to something else .
This is actually live on the Web ; you can see it .
It 's a project called <unk> , which <unk> two different technologies .
One is <unk> and the other is a <unk> research that 's very interesting that made by <unk> <unk> <unk> , a <unk> <unk> student of Washington , with the <unk> <unk> <unk> . It 's a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And it 's alive on the Web , <unk> <unk> .
You can see when we do this kind of <unk> , where we can go from an image to the other and have this kind of experience <unk> <unk> .
But the <unk> <unk> of the images here actually has meaning .
The <unk> <unk> of the computer <unk> these images together , so that they 're <unk> to the <unk> places that are <unk> <unk> all <unk> <unk> <unk> on the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> on the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and these things were all <unk> at the <unk> level .
I don 't know if I 've got time to show you some other environment .
There 's a lot more <unk> .
I want to spend directly directly one of the <unk> of <unk> data , and this <unk> from a <unk> <unk> that we 've done for the first time , I 'm going to work for the first time the thing that we really <unk> is the key behind this technology , <unk> . And it 's not <unk> <unk> , <unk> looking at the <unk> that we 've put in the website .
We had to <unk> <unk> <unk> and so forth .
This is a <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> , other <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> . And they 're going to <unk> <unk> .
So , they 're all <unk> images and have all <unk> <unk> <unk> in this way .
And it 's possible to <unk> this <unk> way .
You know , I would never have thought about to work for <unk> .
It 's very <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
I think that 's a lot of different kinds of <unk> : from the cell phones to those <unk> <unk> <unk> , a <unk> number , <unk> <unk> in this environment .
And if I can , I can <unk> to look for the <unk> <unk> .
Many are <unk> by <unk> , etc . .
<unk> here is a series of photographs -- <unk> .
This is a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
We can go from <unk> to <unk> physics of this environment .
The <unk> point is that we can do things with social environment . This is now <unk> data from the entire <unk> memory of how to <unk> the earth , from the <unk> point of view and <unk> all of that data together .
All of those pictures become <unk> together , more than the <unk> of the parts .
You have a model of the entire <unk> <unk> .
Think about this as the <unk> of the work of the <unk> <unk> on Earth .
It 's something that <unk> in <unk> complexity as people as <unk> <unk> , and which we 're going to be <unk> with the use .
Their pictures are <unk> with <unk> <unk> by other people .
If someone came up with the idea of <unk> all of these <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> all of that data , and I can use it as a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . <unk> like that <unk> <unk> <unk> in that space , using the photos of anyone else , and have a social experience .
Of course , a <unk> of all this is <unk> that 's extremely <unk> <unk> of every interesting part of the earth , <unk> not just by <unk> <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> , but the memory <unk> .
Thank you very much .
CA : I realized what your software is right ?
<unk> : Yes . What 's doing is basically <unk> .
It 's creating <unk> , if you want , between images to the images .
And he 's <unk> it at the content of the images .
The thing becomes very interesting if you think about the <unk> of <unk> information that many of these <unk> images .
As you do a <unk> <unk> , <unk> a <unk> and the text on the page , has a lot of information about images .
Now , what happens if that picture <unk> to all your pictures ?
So the amount of <unk> <unk> and the amount of <unk> that <unk> is really huge . It 's a <unk> effect .
CA : <unk> , it 's really amazing . <unk> .
<unk> : I 'll tell you a lot of .
One of the main <unk> when you <unk> and one of the <unk> research is to be able to live in the people who have no <unk> <unk> <unk> , who <unk> the past <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
We think that <unk> <unk> <unk> even beyond the <unk> <unk> <unk> , or that <unk> <unk> <unk> are still <unk> <unk> , or <unk> , <unk> , or <unk> , <unk> <unk> still the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , to <unk> the <unk> of <unk> , and that the idea that the world in which we live in which is not <unk> , but it 's just a <unk> of <unk> ,
the <unk> of a particular <unk> of <unk> choices that our <unk> has done , well or evil , many <unk> ago .
And of course , all <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Everybody <unk> . Everybody <unk> <unk> .
We 're <unk> to <unk> <unk> .
We have to <unk> the death <unk> , so we don 't get to <unk> if we <unk> and <unk> --
We all have an art .
What <unk> is the <unk> of the song , the <unk> of every culture 's <unk> .
It doesn 't matter that <unk> are <unk> , or the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> , or the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> , or the <unk> <unk> <unk> , or a <unk> in the heart of the <unk> .
He was my <unk> of journey in <unk> a month ago , or a <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> , on <unk> , <unk> , <unk> 's mother 's <unk> .
All of these <unk> <unk> that there are other ways of <unk> the other ways of thinking , other ways of moving around the world .
And if you look at a moment , it 's a concept that can give you hope .
<unk> , the <unk> <unk> of the world create a <unk> <unk> and <unk> that <unk> the planet and is important for the <unk> of the planet , as the <unk> <unk> <unk> known as <unk> .
And you can think of this <unk> <unk> as a <unk> , and you can <unk> the <unk> <unk> of all the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , ideas , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> in being by human imagination of the <unk> .
<unk> is the fantastic <unk> of humanity .
It 's the <unk> of what we are and what we can be be as <unk> species .
And <unk> <unk> was <unk> <unk> <unk> was <unk> to <unk> and <unk> much <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , for example , <unk> that 50 percent of all species has been or is on the <unk> of the <unk> simply because it 's <unk> , or -- in the <unk> <unk> -- in the <unk> <unk> -- in the <unk> diversity .
The <unk> of that is , of course , the <unk> <unk> .
When you 're <unk> <unk> <unk> on this planet .
A language is not just a <unk> or a <unk> of <unk> rules .
A language is the <unk> of the spirit .
It 's the middle with which the <unk> of every culture is coming out of the world .
Every language is a forest of mind , a <unk> , a thought , a <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
And of those <unk> <unk> , as we 're sitting here in <unk> , at least half is no more <unk> in the <unk> of children .
It 's not <unk> to children , which means less <unk> something , which is <unk> <unk> .
What 's more <unk> than being <unk> by the <unk> , of being the last last to talk a language , not <unk> <unk> the <unk> of <unk> or <unk> the <unk> of <unk> or <unk> the <unk> of <unk> ?
This <unk> <unk> was the state of someone in the world every two weeks : every two weeks a <unk> <unk> and <unk> with <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And I know some of you know , " <unk> 't it better . "
The world would not be a better place if we all <unk> the same language ? " So , then we all have to be <unk> .
<unk> <unk> .
<unk> it means not to be able to talk about their own language .
Today I 'd like to take you through the <unk> ...
a little journey in the <unk> to give you a <unk> of what we 're <unk> .
Most of us <unk> that when I say " different ways of <unk> <unk> . " I mean different ways of <unk> .
<unk> for example , this <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , which <unk> <unk> <unk> from the <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
It 's a <unk> that 's not able to <unk> the blue color of the green because the <unk> <unk> is <unk> in the <unk> time of the forest , which we <unk> the <unk> .
They have a <unk> language and a <unk> rule , <unk> " <unk> <unk> " : you 've got to <unk> a person who 's a different language .
This has <unk> in the past <unk> , but the <unk> is that in these families <unk> , and they talk to six or seven <unk> <unk> because of the <unk> <unk> <unk> no language .
It <unk> to listen and then you start talking about .
<unk> one of the most interesting <unk> I 've lived with , the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> , an amazing <unk> that had the first <unk> <unk> in <unk> .
In <unk> , five <unk> have <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
They 've done by the top pictures that <unk> them in <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> that this <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> had never seen anything .
They <unk> the <unk> <unk> . They <unk> them to <unk> a form or a <unk> , not <unk> anything , they <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> , and they <unk> the five <unk> with the <unk> .
But <unk> not only <unk> <unk> .
It <unk> with each other .
<unk> percent of <unk> <unk> had <unk> themselves .
We found two <unk> and found two <unk> and found two <unk> <unk> <unk> , and when we <unk> to know , they <unk> that one of them was <unk> so that he died , and then <unk> it itself .
The <unk> were able to recognize the animal <unk> from 40 <unk> and <unk> the species .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and I had to be a really interesting job when my <unk> <unk> <unk> me if I wanted to go to <unk> <unk> between <unk> society <unk> to the <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
To make sense of <unk> , I should have <unk> culture and that <unk> is not <unk> <unk> .
It 's pretty much of a <unk> <unk> <unk> of the world .
Very interesting .
If you ask you to <unk> the big <unk> of the world , what would you like to do ?
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , etc . .
A continent has been <unk> out , thinking about Africa has no <unk> <unk> . And instead and <unk> is not the <unk> of these <unk> <unk> very <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
What makes the <unk> interesting is the <unk> relationship between life and death .
So <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> can be <unk> by the <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> in that <unk> for a short <unk> , the <unk> becomes the <unk> .
So the <unk> <unk> to say , " <unk> go to <unk> to talk about God .
We <unk> in <unk> and <unk> God . "
And from the moment that you 're <unk> , is the spirit that <unk> you can <unk> you , how do you <unk> ?
So , it 's <unk> to these incredible events : <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a pretty strong <unk> of the power of the body mind when it 's <unk> in a state of <unk> <unk> .
<unk> all the <unk> I 've lived with the most <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , in the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> of the <unk> civilization that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> on the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
In a <unk> continent , this <unk> never been <unk> by <unk> .
In <unk> , I 'm <unk> by a <unk> , but their education is extraordinary .
The young <unk> are <unk> from families to three or four , and they live in a world <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> for 18 years .
Two <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> all of this time , they 're <unk> to the values of their society , <unk> that <unk> their <unk> and only their <unk> <unk> <unk> -- or to say <unk> <unk> .
At the end of this incredible <unk> , they 're <unk> out and for the first time in their lives , at 18 , they see an <unk> . And in that <unk> of the first <unk> <unk> , when the sun <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> , everything that they have been <unk> in his <unk> . <unk> does a <unk> <unk> back and says ,
" <unk> ? I said , " <unk> .
It 's <unk> . Now it 's <unk> . "
They call <unk> , and they say that we , <unk> <unk> , we are the <unk> of the world 's <unk> .
This <unk> level is extremely important .
When we think about the <unk> <unk> and the <unk> <unk> <unk> and the old history of the <unk> <unk> , which is a concept in its <unk> or maybe <unk> <unk> and say that these <unk> are <unk> <unk> to Earth .
The <unk> <unk> are not <unk> or <unk> by <unk> .
There 's not space for these things in the <unk> of <unk> or in the <unk> <unk> of <unk> , but because of time and <unk> , they 've created a <unk> of the Earth 's <unk> not about <unk> <unk> <unk> , but on a <unk> <unk> <unk> : the concept that the Earth can live because it 's <unk> by human consciousness .
What does that mean ?
It means that a <unk> of the <unk> that <unk> <unk> that the mountain is a <unk> spirit that <unk> its <unk> will be a <unk> different human being , and it 's going to be <unk> different relationship with the mountain or that place , <unk> , <unk> , which is a <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> is a <unk> <unk> <unk> to be <unk> .
which is a spirit of a spirit or a <unk> <unk> is <unk> .
What 's interesting is the <unk> that <unk> the relationship between <unk> and the natural world .
I grew up in the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> to be <unk> .
That made me a human being different from my <unk> friends who believe that <unk> are the <unk> <unk> and the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> and the <unk> <unk> <unk> that live in the world of the <unk> <unk> , <unk> that live in the world .
If we were <unk> that these <unk> can actually create different , we could actually start to understand some of their <unk> <unk> . They would <unk> this <unk> .
I <unk> this picture in <unk> in <unk> <unk> .
Maybe some of you 've heard about the <unk> , the most powerful <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> .
What makes <unk> is not the potential <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , but his <unk> . It 's <unk> by two elements .
On one hand , this <unk> <unk> <unk> a series of <unk> , <unk> and <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
<unk> the only <unk> <unk> <unk> a little <unk> <unk> that <unk> a little bit , but it 's <unk> with a <unk> 's <unk> 's <unk> 's <unk> <unk> .
This <unk> has <unk> <unk> <unk> , very similar to <unk> , <unk> .
If you 're going to see the <unk> <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> that 's <unk> <unk> . The <unk> is <unk> .
<unk> that <unk> on the <unk> is a little bit of how to be <unk> by a <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> on a <unk> of electricity . It doesn 't create a <unk> of reality . It doesn 't create the <unk> of reality .
I often had to my <unk> , Richard <unk> <unk> , the man who <unk> was <unk> <unk> , with his discovery of <unk> <unk> in the <unk> in the ' <unk> .
<unk> my <unk> cannot be <unk> because if you 're done not <unk> to tell anybody nobody to be <unk> . The <unk> cannot be <unk> .
It 's possible to be <unk> only if you could <unk> <unk> with other <unk> <unk> that <unk> .
Now , the <unk> that are <unk> in this <unk> are <unk> <unk> , <unk> of the same kind of <unk> for <unk> <unk> . The question <unk> <unk> : in a <unk> of <unk> species , how do these <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> -- they make these <unk> two <unk> don 't like that , but if you 're in this way , they create a <unk> version that 's <unk> <unk> ?
We use the great <unk> of <unk> and <unk> , which can <unk> <unk> .
But if we were to <unk> , we 'll be " The plants talk about it . "
What does that mean ?
This <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in the forest , which <unk> <unk> in the forest , and our eyes <unk> in the same species .
If you <unk> it as <unk> their <unk> will be , " I 'll be " <unk> " <unk> " <unk> . "
The solution is : <unk> <unk> <unk> in a night moon at night and <unk> <unk> with a different <unk> .
And with this doesn 't get <unk> to <unk> , but it 's much more interesting than <unk> <unk> .
Now , [ <unk> ] The problem is that those of us who have <unk> <unk> <unk> them , but somehow <unk> to the <unk> <unk> of history than our real history , and <unk> .
In fact , the <unk> century , in <unk> , not <unk> <unk> <unk> for his <unk> or <unk> <unk> <unk> , but rather like the <unk> was where we <unk> and <unk> or <unk> <unk> the mass <unk> of diversity and <unk> and <unk> <unk> of the planet . Now , the problem is not the change .
All the <unk> through the <unk> have been <unk> in a new <unk> <unk> of life .
And the problem is not technology .
The <unk> <unk> don 't have <unk> to be <unk> when they put <unk> <unk> and <unk> as the <unk> <unk> did not have <unk> to be <unk> when they put <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
It 's not the change or technology that <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> . It 's the power .
The <unk> <unk> of <unk> .
And if you look at the world , you 'll see that these are not <unk> <unk> <unk> .
They 're <unk> creatures and <unk> <unk> out of existence by the <unk> forces that go beyond their <unk> <unk> .
<unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> --
a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , a <unk> that has <unk> <unk> in the forest to a generation of <unk> to a generation <unk> , and now <unk> to the <unk> and the <unk> on the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , where you can see the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , where you can see the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , where the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , where the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> ,
We 're going to <unk> the <unk> with the <unk> <unk> to the forest .
Or in the <unk> case , are the diseases that are <unk> with the <unk> discovery of <unk> .
If we <unk> on the <unk> of the <unk> , where I 'm doing a lot of research , you 'll see the <unk> of political <unk> .
As a <unk> , <unk> physics <unk> of a <unk> , is <unk> at the <unk> level , but <unk> , <unk> , the <unk> of <unk> <unk> , not only is <unk> , but <unk> <unk> in certain <unk> , because it 's part of the development of development .
And you can 't understand the <unk> <unk> until you get <unk> from the beginning .
I <unk> <unk> miles from <unk> in China through the <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> with a young <unk> , but only come to <unk> it with a young <unk> , but only come to me to understand what there is behind .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> million people are <unk> from the <unk> during the <unk> <unk> .
The father of this guy was <unk> at <unk> <unk> .
which means that it was <unk> to the <unk> of Chinese <unk> .
<unk> <unk> is <unk> <unk> with <unk> <unk> <unk> , which brought the <unk> in <unk> .
My mother was <unk> and his <unk> was to be <unk> .
It was taken of <unk> in <unk> at the age of two <unk> <unk> his <unk> because he could have no <unk> .
The <unk> , which has done the same , was <unk> in <unk> .
One day he <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> , and for this <unk> , was <unk> <unk> to <unk> work for seven years .
The <unk> of <unk> can be <unk> , but the spirit of the <unk> <unk> is from <unk> present .
And then all <unk> to a choice .
<unk> to live in the world 's <unk> or we want to <unk> the world of diversity of diversity ?
The great <unk> <unk> <unk> , before he died said that his greatest fear was that it was that , in our going to go to this <unk> <unk> <unk> of the human imagination to a <unk> <unk> of thinking , but a day it <unk> us from a <unk> <unk> <unk> of thinking , but a day it 's <unk> us from a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that there were other possibilities .
And it 's <unk> to <unk> that our species has been <unk> for <unk> years .
The <unk> <unk> , which gave us <unk> to <unk> , which <unk> us to <unk> <unk> , <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> with the <unk> of <unk> , creating the <unk> <unk> <unk> , and we talk about <unk> years ago .
The <unk> world has <unk> 300 years old .
That <unk> history doesn 't tell me that we have answers to all the challenges that we <unk> to <unk> in <unk> to come .
When these <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , what it means to be human , <unk> with <unk> different <unk> .
And it 's in those <unk> that all <unk> the chance to be what we are : a <unk> species , which has to <unk> the <unk> and all the <unk> can <unk> . And there 's a big <unk> moments .
I <unk> this picture on the <unk> north of <unk> , when I went to <unk> <unk> with <unk> , and this man , <unk> , <unk> me the wonderful story of his <unk> .
The <unk> government wasn 't always <unk> with the <unk> <unk> and in the <unk> to <unk> our <unk> , and we <unk> it in <unk> .
The <unk> of this man <unk> <unk> .
The family , <unk> for his life , <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
You want to know that <unk> doesn 't <unk> <unk> , <unk> it .
The <unk> of the <unk> <unk> were made of <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> of this man did not <unk> by night <unk> or <unk> .
It 's <unk> away , it <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> in their <unk> . When I did it <unk> , and then they <unk> them , they <unk> them , they <unk> them <unk> them .
He <unk> <unk> on the <unk> of this <unk> <unk> , and when <unk> <unk> <unk> , he <unk> a dog .
He <unk> the dog and created a <unk> , with the <unk> <unk> <unk> created a <unk> , and he <unk> on the <unk> , <unk> <unk> in <unk> .
What about <unk> with anything ?
<unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> government <unk> to <unk> control of an area of bigger <unk> in California and <unk> <unk> together .
It 's their new <unk> . It 's called <unk> .
It 's a <unk> <unk> . It 's <unk> all the resources .
One <unk> example of how a <unk> can <unk> with his <unk> .
And , finally , I think it 's quite <unk> at least to the people of us has been in these <unk> <unk> areas of the planet , <unk> that are not <unk> at all .
For someone is home .
<unk> <unk> of human imagination that <unk> to <unk> <unk> . And for all of us , the dreams of these children , like the dreams of our children , become part of the <unk> of hope <unk> .
<unk> , we <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> never <unk> to anything .
I knew the <unk> --
[ <unk> ] [ <unk> ] [ <unk> ] , but we believe that stories can change the world , and perhaps we are the best <unk> to tell the stories of the world . Every month our site <unk> <unk> million <unk> .
<unk> <unk> : <unk> our <unk> <unk> .
Our <unk> are <unk> of millions .
Our work is <unk> in <unk> to bring our audience to bring our audience to <unk> <unk> from <unk> , which <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . The <unk> <unk> of <unk> : the <unk> world of <unk> <unk> in diversity , and we need to find a <unk> world of <unk> in diversity , and we need to find a <unk> world .
where the <unk> of all <unk> can <unk> to our <unk> <unk> .
Thank you .
I 'm going to talk about some of the things that I wrote in this book that 's <unk> <unk> other that you 've heard and <unk> a few <unk> , in case you don 't know .
I want to start with what I call " <unk> <unk> . "
The <unk> of what ?
The <unk> <unk> of all <unk> society will be <unk> . The <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> : " If we want to <unk> <unk> <unk> . "
The reason is , on one side , in fact that freedom is <unk> itself , is <unk> , <unk> , <unk> for humans .
On the other one is that if we are <unk> , each of us to do everything that we <unk> our <unk> , without anybody who who 's <unk> our <unk> , without any that we have in the name of it .
The way to <unk> the freedom is to <unk> choice .
<unk> the people have , more <unk> , and more they 're <unk> , and more <unk> is their <unk> .
This is <unk> <unk> in society that no one <unk> <unk> in society that no one <unk> <unk> .
And it 's also <unk> <unk> in our lives .
I 'm going to show you some examples of what progress made possible .
This is my <unk> . It 's particularly big .
I had a simple note on the <unk> <unk> .
In my <unk> , there are <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that no one of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and 12 <unk> <unk> you can buy a huge number of <unk> in the <unk> that no one of the <unk> <unk> <unk> that no <unk> already is <unk> is <unk> to your <unk> .
Here 's what <unk> is .
And then you go to the <unk> store for buy a <unk> : <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , radio , <unk> , <unk> .
And in this single <unk> store , there 's a big number of <unk> <unk> .
We can make six and a half million different <unk> using the <unk> that there are in one <unk> .
<unk> <unk> that there is <unk> choice .
<unk> <unk> : The world of <unk> .
Once , when I was a child , they could get all the <unk> services , in <unk> that they were <unk> by <unk> <unk> .
You <unk> the phone , you don 't <unk> it .
And a <unk> of that , in between the other , was that the phone never <unk> .
These days are gone .
We have a <unk> <unk> <unk> , especially between cell phones .
Here 's cell phones .
My <unk> is in the middle , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> .
If you haven 't seen it in the store under the store , you 're very soon that you 're <unk> .
And what happens is that people <unk> in the <unk> and makes this question . And you know , what the answer is ? And you know , what the answer is " No . "
It 's not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn 't make things .
So , in other <unk> of life that are much more important than <unk> , is <unk> the same <unk> of choices .
<unk> <unk> : It doesn 't happen in the United States that you 're <unk> from the <unk> and the <unk> you would like to do .
Instead , <unk> from the <unk> , and the <unk> says , " OK , could do it , or <unk> , " he said , " Well , could do it , " he 's got these <unk> and these <unk> . What do you want to do ? "
You ask him , " What do you want to do ? "
And the <unk> says , " He 's got these <unk> and these <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> . "
" What do you want to do ? "
And you say , " <unk> if she was me , what would you like ? "
And the <unk> : " But I 'm not her . "
The result we call it " <unk> <unk> , " <unk> , " <unk> , " <unk> that makes it look like a <unk> thing .
But actually it 's not a <unk> of <unk> and responsibility to make decisions from someone who knows something that knows something , <unk> the <unk> , <unk> that doesn 't know -- and almost certainly is <unk> <unk> -- and so that 's not in the <unk> <unk> to make the decisions about the patient .
There 's a huge <unk> of <unk> products , <unk> to people like me and you , that if you think about it has no sense , because we can 't <unk> .
But if we can 't <unk> , why would we get them ?
The answer is that they want to <unk> , we call the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> of <unk> <unk> , is a question of that is a choice , as you see in this <unk> . " We don 't want to <unk> children . <unk> their sex at the right time . " No more a <unk> . We don 't have to be <unk> .
And we can <unk> how many times we <unk> .
which means that every <unk> , <unk> , you have to decide that kind of person you want to be .
It <unk> to family and <unk> , a <unk> , a common perspective , almost for anyone who , was that <unk> <unk> to us as soon as possible , and you could get kids to the <unk> as soon as possible .
The only real choice was with who , not when , and even what to do later .
<unk> , everything is really to play .
They were very smart students , and they <unk> 20 percent of them in less than a time .
And not because they 're less <unk> , not because they 're less <unk> .
But why are I 'm <unk> , I 'll say , " <unk> <unk> or not ? "
" <unk> <unk> <unk> later ? I 've got to think about children or career or career ? "
I 'm <unk> <unk> .
And they try to answer these questions , even if this <unk> doesn 't <unk> the <unk> that <unk> and not get a beautiful <unk> to my <unk> .
And they really have to do that . They 're important questions .
Now , the work : we 're <unk> , as <unk> <unk> , because technology <unk> us to work every minute , every day , from every day , from every day of the planet , <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , there 's a <unk> , and I won 't say anybody who 's where the <unk> works .
I don 't say that , because I want to use it .
What does this incredible choice of choice that we have about work ? It 's that we need to <unk> , <unk> at any time , if we have to work or not .
We can go to see our son to play <unk> , with the cell phone in one <unk> , the other , and the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , on the <unk> .
And even if I 'm all <unk> , every minute that we see the <unk> , we 're also <unk> , " I have to answer this call ? "
" I have to answer this <unk> ? I have to <unk> this letter ? "
And even when the answer is " no , " that makes the experience <unk> experience of your <unk> very <unk> son .
So , from any of them , small things and big , <unk> materials and <unk> of life , is a question of choice .
Once the world was this : <unk> , there were some possibilities , but it wasn 't all about choice .
The world of today is <unk> to this : " Is it a <unk> thing , or <unk> ? "
The answer is <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> all of them , so I 'm going to talk about the <unk> of the <unk> .
We had this choice <unk> two effects effects of people .
The first one , <unk> , is that <unk> instead of <unk> .
<unk> <unk> between the choice , it becomes very difficult to do it .
I 'll give you an example : a study <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
A <unk> of my <unk> <unk> <unk> , with about a million <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> , with about a million <unk> <unk> in different companies .
What she discovered is that for every 10 of the solutions that are <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of two percent .
<unk> 50 <unk> <unk> , there 's 10 percent less than <unk> <unk> than <unk> when they 're available to only five . Why ?
Because with 50 <unk> between which choice , is to decide to decide , and the choice is <unk> to <unk> .
And in <unk> , and again , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and of course , <unk> <unk> never comes .
<unk> that doesn 't only mean that these <unk> <unk> <unk> food to <unk> because they don 't have enough money , it wants to say that the decision is so <unk> that they also <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
It 's not <unk> , they 're <unk> to five <unk> <unk> for year from the work , which would be <unk> to <unk> .
So <unk> is a <unk> of <unk> choices .
And I think that 's the world like this .
" And finally , to end the <unk> : <unk> , <unk> or <unk> ? "
It just <unk> to make the right decision , if it 's for the <unk> , right ?
You don 't want to choose the wrong <unk> , and you 'll get the <unk> wrong .
So that 's the first effect . The second effect is that even if we can <unk> <unk> and make a choice , at the end of the <unk> of how we have to <unk> <unk> .
And that 's for different reasons .
One of them is that with a lot of <unk> between which choice , if you take one and not perfect , is to imagine that they could make a different choice that would be better . And what 's going on is that <unk> <unk> us to <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> from choice , and the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> , even when it was a <unk> decision .
<unk> more choices there are , easier to <unk> than any <unk> that <unk> is <unk> of <unk> choice .
<unk> , there 's what <unk> call .
Dan <unk> <unk> very well <unk> like the value that we give them <unk> things from what we <unk> .
<unk> rest of them , when there 's a lot of <unk> possible , it 's easy to <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> that 's choice .
Here 's an example . I 'm <unk> with all the ones that are not in New York .
But that 's what probably <unk> .
There 's this <unk> <unk> .
A <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> . <unk> day . It 's all about it .
It doesn 't <unk> anything . But what he thinks is , " Well , <unk> , it 's <unk> . "
" All my <unk> <unk> are <unk> . "
" <unk> <unk> <unk> right in front of home . "
And it 's going to go two weeks from the idea that 's <unk> -- every day -- the <unk> <unk> where it wants .
The <unk> <unk> <unk> for what we have , even when choice was <unk> .
And the <unk> that we have <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> us against how to <unk> .
Here 's another example .
This <unk> tells us a lot of things .
It 's about living the moment , and maybe of living living slowly .
But the most important thing is that you 're going to be <unk> , you 're not going to do the other .
The things that don 't <unk> a lot of <unk> that can make less <unk> what we do .
<unk> <unk> : <unk> <unk> <unk> .
I tried it on my skin <unk> a new couple of <unk> .
It 's almost always <unk> .
Once the <unk> were in one , just like , <unk> them and <unk> <unk> , only after <unk> , only after <unk> a life <unk> and <unk> a lot of times , they 'll get to go well .
So , I went to <unk> a new couple of when the <unk> were gone , and I said , " I need a couple of <unk> , this is my <unk> . "
The <unk> said to me , " <unk> wants to <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> ? "
Do you want them to <unk> or <unk> ?
" Do you want to <unk> it ? "
" <unk> wants to <unk> or <unk> ? <unk> <unk> <unk> -- " <unk> <unk> . "
I was <unk> , and after a little bit I was able to say , " I want the guy that was the only guy , " he had no idea what he was , so for an hour , I 'm all <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and then <unk> from the <unk> , <unk> , with the best <unk> <unk> I 've ever had .
It was the <unk> . With all that choice had <unk> the best .
But it 's worse .
Why ? I wrote a whole book to <unk> .
The reason I was to be worse is that with all that choice my <unk> were <unk> , the <unk> <unk> to be <unk> .
At first I had <unk> <unk> . I didn 't know anything about <unk> when I just had a <unk> <unk> , but when we <unk> 100 different , I would say , at least one had to be perfect .
What I had <unk> was good , but not perfect .
After I <unk> that <unk> with what I was <unk> , in <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> in people 's lives not <unk> that <unk> the <unk> of those <unk> <unk> themselves .
And this <unk> <unk> <unk> , even when the results are good .
<unk> in the world of the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Because if you look at it , I 'm not going to <unk> what I 'm talking about .
The <unk> truth is more to this .
" It was better when it was worse , " The reason that he was better when he was <unk> <unk> as well as the worse , it was <unk> <unk> .
<unk> , in the world that we live in -- <unk> , <unk> <unk> citizens with the <unk> <unk> -- the <unk> that we can <unk> is that things are <unk> <unk> .
You 've never seen <unk> <unk> because your <unk> , my <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
The <unk> of happiness -- you 're where you 're here -- is , " <unk> <unk> . "
I mean -- little <unk> moment -- I 'm really <unk> and my wife is really <unk> .
I couldn 't do better , I didn 't have <unk> .
But <unk> doesn 't always <unk> .
<unk> , a <unk> of <unk> <unk> when you 're just <unk> when you 're just that kind of <unk> is that when you 're not <unk> , and you say , " Why ? "
Who is <unk> ? " <unk> is <unk> .
The world is <unk> . What could I do with it ?
When you have hundreds of hundreds of <unk> <unk> , and you get one <unk> , and you 'll get to <unk> who is <unk> , it 's <unk> clear that the <unk> you are .
We could do better .
With hundreds of <unk> <unk> , there 's no <unk> for <unk> .
So when people make decisions , even if the <unk> is <unk> , they <unk> <unk> and <unk> themselves .
In the last few years , the <unk> is <unk> in the <unk> world .
I think a <unk> <unk> -- not the only , but important -- of this <unk> <unk> of <unk> is really <unk> experience because people are <unk> experiences because the standard are too <unk> .
And when they have to <unk> this situation they think <unk> is them .
So the final result is that we better , <unk> , <unk> , but we 'll get worse .
Let me tell you .
This is the <unk> <unk> , what we all take for good and is completely <unk> . It 's not true .
There 's no <unk> that a little bit of choice is better than <unk> at all , but this doesn 't have any choice to make sure that much choice is better than a little bit .
There 's a <unk> value . I don 't know what it is .
But I 'm quite sure we 've <unk> from a piece of the level that we <unk> our lives .
Now , from the <unk> point of view -- from <unk> point of view , <unk> is <unk> .
What it allows all this choice in <unk> society is the <unk> material .
There are many places in the world , and you 'll have <unk> <unk> <unk> , where the problem is not that they have <unk> choice .
The problem is they have too <unk> .
So the <unk> I 'm talking about is a <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> society .
And what <unk> does <unk> and <unk> is this : <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to you yesterday about how much those <unk> and <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> to <unk> are <unk> . It 's a <unk> of money .
I mean that these choices , <unk> and <unk> , is not that they 're just <unk> .
I 'm <unk> <unk> .
They make us worse .
If you 're a little bit of what in our society <unk> choice was <unk> in those where people have too few <unk> , it wouldn 't just be their lives to <unk> but also our own .
This is what <unk> call a <unk> <unk> .
A <unk> of income does well <unk> to all -- not only the poor -- because of this choice in <unk> that we <unk> .
So to <unk> : " <unk> , you can become everything you want to --
<unk> , people of culture , " But what would you say that fish ? "
" It 's <unk> that you can 't do anything in a glass <unk> . "
" A <unk> , a <unk> <unk> , a <unk> view of the world --
and I <unk> it like this , at the beginning .
But then , <unk> , instead , I realized that that fish knows it 's a long .
Because the reality of the <unk> is that if you <unk> the <unk> , so that it 's possible , " you can 't <unk> the freedom . It 's <unk> <unk> .
If you could <unk> the <unk> so that everything could <unk> <unk> the <unk> .
