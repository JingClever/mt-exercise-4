The year I showed these <unk> for <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> , which for almost three million years , which was the <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> is <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , it 's 40 percent .
And so this <unk> <unk> <unk> of the problem because it 's not <unk> the ice <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> is , in a sense , the heart of the <unk> system .
They <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The next <unk> will be a <unk> <unk> on the <unk> of the last 25 years .
<unk> <unk> are <unk> in the <unk> .
As you see , you see it <unk> to the blue <unk> .
What is the ice in <unk> , which <unk> <unk> <unk> .
You can see that the ice <unk> <unk> , of five years or more , it 's like the <unk> , which here <unk> from the body .
In 25 years , so , in the past , so .
This is a problem because the <unk> <unk> in the <unk> around the ocean around the ocean <unk> <unk> , where there are <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> in <unk> .
<unk> at the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> , that <unk> <unk> , the amount of <unk> , <unk> this point of not <unk> .
In some <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> is already <unk> in the <unk> <unk> is already <unk> from the water .
The <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> is <unk> with a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> ! <unk> : <unk> <unk> .
A reason is that this <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> from the <unk> <unk> from the <unk> .
This is a <unk> river <unk> .
The <unk> had never <unk> <unk> .
This is the <unk> river , in the <unk> <unk> .
If you want to know how the <unk> level of the <unk> <unk> on <unk> , here is where the sea .
These <unk> are <unk> <unk> .
And then another part of the planet : <unk> , the most <unk> <unk> of ice planet .
The month , the scientists have <unk> that the <unk> <unk> of ice is in <unk> , and that <unk> <unk> on some <unk> <unk> , is particularly <unk> in <unk> .
<unk> to <unk> <unk> , as as in <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , the third <unk> , the most <unk> of ice , you see new <unk> , which few years ago , they were <unk> .
The 40 percent of the world 's population <unk> <unk> <unk> from the <unk> .
<unk> <unk> : this <unk> is the <unk> of <unk> water <unk> of this city .
The <unk> is <unk> .
But when I <unk> , when the <unk> water .
In California , <unk> <unk> is <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> is <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> are in the crisis .
<unk> , as you know , they 're <unk> .
<unk> <unk> in the world to a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> are <unk> <unk> <unk> out of the normal <unk> , and <unk> .
And more <unk> <unk> in the last 30 years of the <unk> <unk> .
This is a <unk> of all <unk> .
If you look at the context context of the <unk> , you can see the <unk> .
In the last five years we have <unk> <unk> million <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> , every day , <unk> in the ocean every day .
Look at the <unk> area of the <unk> , from <unk> , and <unk> , and on both the <unk> <unk> , where there 's a <unk> <unk> <unk> of oxygen in the ocean .
The most <unk> of the global <unk> , and the <unk> , which is 20 percent , is the <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
The oil is a problem , and the <unk> is even even even .
The United States are one of the two countries with more <unk> , together to China .
And they <unk> to build a lot of other <unk> <unk> .
But we 're <unk> to a <unk> direction .
These are the <unk> <unk> in the last last years and some <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And every way , there 's a <unk> politics in our country .
The <unk> of <unk> and <unk> <unk> have <unk> <unk> million dollars in the last year to <unk> the <unk> <unk> , which is a <unk> .
I <unk> image , I was something --
<unk> <unk> , where I live , where I live , there was a <unk> <unk> <unk> billion <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
Maybe you 've seen it on the <unk> .
This is the second <unk> <unk> in America .
It 's happened around <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> of one of <unk> <unk> was this .
<unk> : <unk> ♫ ♫ <unk> <unk> is a kind of <unk> and happy .
It 's <unk> here in America , and it does our economy .
<unk> the <unk> is always more <unk> .
It 's <unk> <unk> , <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> : <unk> here is the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> .
The most big <unk> society on the <unk> is <unk> <unk> . This is <unk> <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> : <unk> <unk> -- <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> -- not know what they 're talking about .
<unk> <unk> : So the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> two <unk> .
This is a <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> we see the <unk> <unk> , we see the <unk> <unk> as a <unk> <unk> <unk> to our business .
So , this our <unk> is <unk> a big amount of money in a <unk> <unk> to make the <unk> of the <unk> .
In fact , the <unk> is not <unk> .
We think it 's <unk> -- it 's also a good <unk> .
So , we don 't <unk> change .
We do to do it .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> -- you know -- you 've heard about a lot of talk about it .
So I <unk> a <unk> <unk> in a <unk> structure to the <unk> as the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> ! The machines are a little bit <unk> , but this is the sound of the <unk> of technology .
<unk> <unk> is between the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , but the <unk> technology of <unk> that you see see the <unk> of <unk> that you see .
We look at a look at the <unk> : this is the <unk> technology .
<unk> <unk> : <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> .
<unk> : The <unk> : The America is in the economy ; the <unk> crisis , the <unk> crisis .
The <unk> <unk> all : our <unk> all : our <unk> <unk> <unk> , as the <unk> <unk> <unk> and the oil <unk> .
But now , there 's a new <unk> , <unk> solution to <unk> .
<unk> America : 100 percent of energy <unk> , in 10 years .
A <unk> for <unk> America to work , <unk> <unk> , and to help <unk> the global <unk> .
<unk> , a solution that we <unk> to solve our problems .
<unk> America . <unk> .
<unk> <unk> : This is the last .
<unk> : <unk> is <unk> <unk> .
One of the most <unk> ways of <unk> <unk> <unk> from <unk> <unk> that <unk> our planet .
<unk> : The future is here . <unk> , the sun , a new <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> : <unk> <unk> for places .
<unk> : <unk> . It 's time to be <unk> .
<unk> <unk> : A <unk> <unk> <unk> says , " If you want to go , you go to .
If you want to go to go to go to go . "
We have to go to <unk> , quickly .
Thank you very much .
The year <unk> I <unk> a <unk> on the <unk> .
And I <unk> <unk> to <unk> on how it works .
So , I <unk> . And for those that the other time , there were not , the <unk> is the most <unk> <unk> experiment -- <unk> miles <unk> <unk> .
<unk> is <unk> the <unk> that were in the <unk> that were in less than a <unk> <unk> <unk> from the beginning of the universe -- to <unk> million times .
All that 's just <unk> .
This is the car <unk> .
They <unk> these <unk> <unk> in the <unk> .
This is what I work . It 's called <unk> <unk> -- is <unk> <unk> <unk> feet and it 's a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
This is a <unk> image of <unk> in the <unk> , so you can see the <unk> .
The 10 <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> the car for the first time .
And this picture was <unk> by <unk> .
It was because of <unk> <unk> in the <unk> .
It 's an image of the first <unk> of <unk> <unk> , <unk> in <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> <unk> in the <unk> .
In other words , when you <unk> that image the <unk> 10 <unk> , which the <unk> <unk> machine , which is a big <unk> .
I don 't know if it was this <unk> to <unk> more or this <unk> <unk> , when somebody on Google , and <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
What it means we had a <unk> impact on the <unk> .
And I was a week after , there was a problem with the car , we had to these <unk> here -- these <unk> <unk> <unk> .
These <unk> <unk> <unk> when the <unk> works at the <unk> of <unk> .
Now , the <unk> between you <unk> and <unk> , " It 's not true . They 're too <unk> . "
And instead can do that because when they 're very <unk> <unk> <unk> .
So , in less <unk> , to a temperature temperature <unk> to the space of the stars , these <unk> can <unk> that <unk> .
In one of the <unk> between the most <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> , there was a <unk> <unk> .
So the <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
This was the result .
Now , this is more <unk> if you think that these <unk> <unk> <unk> , and that <unk> <unk> , and that <unk> are <unk> about 30 .
They 're <unk> about 50 <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , what we did .
We <unk> them and <unk> .
Now , they 're <unk> all <unk> .
And it <unk> the end of <unk> the <unk> will be <unk> new <unk> .
The <unk> , and we <unk> us to get <unk> data to <unk> or <unk> , and we go to understand what the <unk> are <unk> that <unk> the universe .
Now , of course , in a way , these <unk> <unk> the <unk> of science and <unk> <unk> . It 's <unk> <unk> . It 's easy to <unk> .
I think the fact that it 's so hard , the fact , the <unk> , I think is the value of things like <unk> .
I 'd like to <unk> with the words of a <unk> <unk> , which , <unk> , in <unk> <unk> , and he was <unk> <unk> , his <unk> <unk> was <unk> , " <unk> is <unk> <unk> for the <unk> of human ideas as as the <unk> of the <unk> of science , and the ideas of <unk> that they don 't have <unk> <unk> .
Thank you .
I want to start <unk> <unk> , when , children , <unk> with <unk> .
As <unk> <unk> as <unk> and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , <unk> , in fact , and <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> is <unk> <unk> to the way that <unk> <unk> in the way that <unk> <unk> in us .
So , from <unk> <unk> from the <unk> of our <unk> <unk> with <unk> objects , and my <unk> <unk> , and my <unk> <unk> <unk> , and my <unk> <unk> , and I started <unk> , " and , when we 're just <unk> <unk> <unk> , " and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> ,
and <unk> to our <unk> ?
The question was so interesting that we <unk> to explore the answer , building the <unk> .
In a few words , a <unk> is a computer computer as a <unk> .
In a few words , a <unk> is a computer computer as a <unk> .
You can <unk> them with the hand , " <unk> " between them , " <unk> " between them , and they have a <unk> <unk> .
But <unk> , they 're <unk> objects , as the <unk> , you can just <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> are the <unk> of a new <unk> of tools for <unk> the <unk> information .
And <unk> as a <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , and other , and <unk> , as as <unk> <unk> , and other , as they 're <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
I <unk> with some simple example .
This <unk> is <unk> to show <unk> : if you <unk> the video : if you <unk> the video , the video <unk> so if you <unk> from the other <unk> <unk> .
These <unk> <unk> are <unk> <unk> .
If you <unk> them , you know what they 're going to <unk> them .
If they <unk> , they <unk> and they can <unk> a little bit .
If they <unk> , they <unk> and they can <unk> a little bit .
They also <unk> their movement and <unk> .
We 're <unk> that one of the interesting of the <unk> of <unk> was <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk> of the data , to the <unk> , " a <unk> <unk> .
In this case , we have three <unk> <unk> as <unk> <unk> and I can <unk> <unk> for <unk> <unk> , where they <unk> <unk> .
and I can <unk> for <unk> <unk> in the color , where they <unk> <unk> .
If you 're <unk> too , we can <unk> a little bit of it .
I 'm also <unk> to <unk> , as the <unk> , the mathematics and <unk> where people can <unk> <unk> , and <unk> the <unk> <unk> .
Now , I 'm --
This is a <unk> <unk> that I do with a program .
Here we have a <unk> game .
<unk> , to every <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> , <unk> a <unk> <unk> , <unk> , every <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> , and as <unk> <unk> <unk> , and as <unk> <unk> <unk> , he <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , he <unk> <unk> <unk> on a <unk> .
And then , after about 30 seconds , and you have a new <unk> <unk> and <unk> and new <unk> .
Thank you .
So , here 's the children in <unk> <unk> , I did them in the <unk> <unk> , I <unk> them , and I <unk> a video .
They 're <unk> very <unk> .
And one of the interesting things of this <unk> is that you don 't have to <unk> people .
They just say , " <unk> of words , " and they know what do .
Here 's here here 's <unk> .
This is our <unk> <unk> <unk> , there 's the <unk> <unk> there .
It 's actually wanted to <unk> .
They were just <unk> , for him .
Now , this is a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
It <unk> to build a <unk> <unk> . He 's <unk> .
It can <unk> new <unk> in the <unk> , <unk> their <unk> .
It can <unk> new <unk> in the <unk> , <unk> their <unk> .
That 's doing this <unk> .
<unk> : The sun is <unk> .
David <unk> : Now , he <unk> a <unk> in the <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> .
<unk> work !
So , <unk> <unk> and <unk> can <unk> the <unk> ,
<unk> : <unk> !
<unk> their story .
<unk> : <unk> !
<unk> : It 's a story with the final story , and it can understand it .
<unk> : It 's a story with the final story , and it can understand it .
<unk> : <unk> . <unk> .
<unk> : The last example I have the <unk> , I 've been a <unk> , for <unk> and <unk> music .
It 's a <unk> , <unk> , for <unk> and <unk> music .
<unk> here <unk> <unk> as the <unk> , and the <unk> .
And we have four different <unk> , and you can 't want to do .
You can also <unk> these <unk> in a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And I just just <unk> a sound <unk> , " and a <unk> <unk> . "
These are actually you can control from the <unk> , as the <unk> and the <unk> .
I <unk> the <unk> to a particular sound and then <unk> <unk> .
And then there are the <unk> as time and <unk> , and <unk> , which <unk> <unk> to the whole <unk> .
It 's <unk> as it works .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> in two <unk> , " <unk> <unk> , the <unk> in a series , the <unk> , the <unk> , the other <unk> .
Now , let 's <unk> a line .
<unk> : Now , <unk> <unk> : <unk> <unk>
<unk> : And now I 'm going to <unk> the <unk> <unk> , so I can control the <unk> .
<unk> : I can <unk> the entire <unk> <unk> <unk> the time from a time , or another .
<unk> : And now now <unk> the <unk> <unk> to <unk> the bottom for <unk> .
<unk> : I can <unk> the <unk> <unk> . "
So I don 't have to <unk> before , but I can <unk> , <unk> , more <unk> ,
And now , I can <unk> the entire <unk> <unk> <unk> on the left <unk> <unk> . "
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is to build new <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and more <unk> as more <unk> to how our brain and body .
And today , I had time to show you one of the <unk> of this <unk> of this <unk> of this <unk> of <unk> .
The concept I want to <unk> is that 's <unk> this new generation of objects to <unk> with the <unk> <unk> , which we want to <unk> information in our world we want .
Thank you very much .
I don 't see the now of the talk about all .
They 're a <unk> .
<unk> books is my <unk> , but it 's more than this , of course .
It 's also the love and the <unk> of my life .
And I don 't know what it can change .
But , I said , this is <unk> <unk> in my life and in my career and in my career , which <unk> me to <unk> the whole <unk> with this work .
And the particular thing is that I <unk> this book , this <unk> called <unk> , " <unk> , " <unk> , " which <unk> <unk> , " which <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And the result is that all <unk> now , people <unk> me like if I was <unk> .
<unk> -- <unk> , <unk> !
I 'm going to <unk> all <unk> and say , " You don 't fear that I don 't have more to do better than to do better ?
You don 't know , you don 't know about the life that we can be able to create a book that can <unk> to someone ? "
What can you know ? "
It 's <unk> , you know .
But I could go to the <unk> , and I remember that more than 20 years ago , when I was <unk> -- I was going to say , I wanted to be a <unk> .
I <unk> <unk> to the same <unk> <unk> .
And people said , " Don 't <unk> to be able to do success ?
You don 't think the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> you <unk> ?
You don 't know that <unk> to do this <unk> for all of life , and it would be <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> ? "
So , you know .
The answer -- the <unk> answer to all these questions is : "
And so , I think of all those things .
I always had fear .
And I also have <unk> many other things that people don 't have <unk> .
As the <unk> and other things .
But , as as I thought I thought , and I thought I was <unk> <unk> , why ?
Is it <unk> ?
It 's <unk> that anybody anybody <unk> to be <unk> by a work that <unk> <unk> <unk> to do .
But what is so so in the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> on <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in a way that other <unk> <unk> don 't ?
How do I was a <unk> <unk> , and I remember , and I remember , and I remember a time in his 40 years of <unk> in which I thought , if they were <unk> <unk> ?
It was never -- that <unk> <unk> of <unk> , how it 's <unk> <unk> .
They don 't <unk> so , <unk> ?
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> as a group of course , in the <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
We <unk> , we have enough this <unk> , and we don 't just <unk> , but we have this <unk> of being <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And they don 't want to look at the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> that , just in the <unk> century , <unk> young and often for them .
And even those who don 't have <unk> to be <unk> by their <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , before , in the last <unk> <unk> said , " Every book , " Every book , " I <unk> a little bit more <unk> about the work of their life .
But we don 't <unk> when you know , because we 've heard these things so much as we have <unk> and <unk> the <unk> that <unk> creativity and <unk> <unk> the <unk> that <unk> and <unk> are in some <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
And the question I want to <unk> all here is : you 're going to do this idea ?
And I 'm going to go to this thing -- because it 's also <unk> to me .
I think it 's <unk> .
And I think it 's also <unk> and I want to <unk> <unk> in the next century .
I think it 's better <unk> our big <unk> <unk> to live .
And I know , I know , in my case -- in my situation -- it would be very <unk> to <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> in which I 'm in my career .
<unk> -- look at , I 'm quite young , I have about 40 years .
I still about four <unk> of work in me .
And it 's very <unk> that any <unk> <unk> that any <unk> <unk> in the world as the work that <unk> after the <unk> <unk> <unk> of my last book .
<unk> <unk> , because we 're all more or less friends here -- it 's <unk> that my <unk> .
Oh , <unk> , who thought !
You know , this is the kind of thinking that <unk> a person to <unk> <unk> <unk> at the morning , and I don 't want to do it .
I want to do this work that I love .
So , the question is , how ?
And so so , I think , after many <unk> , which the way to work to write and write a <unk> <unk> <unk> , OK ?
I have to find in some of <unk> <unk> between me , and my natural <unk> <unk> , and my natural <unk> on which <unk> <unk> , as <unk> for all the last year , as we <unk> to look at the last <unk> , to find out of the best <unk> and more <unk> ideas to find more <unk> and more <unk> ideas and more <unk> <unk> , if we 're more <unk> <unk> , and more <unk> <unk> and more <unk> , and more <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and
<unk> on how to help people <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of creativity .
And that research <unk> me to <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
And then I <unk> because they <unk> back and then <unk> back .
<unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> -- people don 't believe that the <unk> creativity , OK ?
And they <unk> that the creativity was this <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> , and <unk> , for reasons reasons and <unk> , for reasons and <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> . "
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> from <unk> .
<unk> were <unk> in the same idea , but <unk> that species of the spirit without a <unk> .
The <unk> is <unk> , because the <unk> <unk> not really <unk> that a <unk> was a <unk> <unk> .
And I think a <unk> was this species of <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of a <unk> , a little <unk> like <unk> , and that <unk> out of <unk> <unk> <unk> the work of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the work of the work of the work of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> here , that 's the <unk> of which I 'm about -- that <unk> you <unk> you from the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And all <unk> that was so that I think that <unk> , right ?
So , <unk> artists were <unk> <unk> things , as as the <unk> , for example , right ?
If your work was <unk> not <unk> <unk> all the <unk> , all <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
If your work <unk> , you didn 't know , you know , right ?
And all <unk> that was your <unk> to be a <unk> .
And so people <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> for very time .
And then the <unk> <unk> and everything , and <unk> this big idea ; we put the human being in the center of the <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> this big idea .
This was the <unk> of <unk> and people <unk> to think that the <unk> <unk> of <unk> .
And for the first time in the story , you <unk> to this or that artist as a <unk> <unk> in the <unk> .
And I have to <unk> , I think , it was a big <unk> .
I think I think that <unk> to someone , a <unk> person to believe of being as a <unk> as the <unk> , the <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> is a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
It 's like to ask someone of <unk> the sun .
<unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> all of these <unk> <unk> on the <unk> .
And I think it 's a <unk> <unk> <unk> artists in <unk> .
And , if this is true , and I think it 's , the question , and now ?
We do that ?
I would go back to a <unk> <unk> of human relationship between humans and <unk> .
Or maybe it 's not .
Maybe we can 't <unk> 500 years of thinking in a <unk> talk about 18 minutes .
And there 's probably people between the audience that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> on the <unk> , you do people <unk> <unk> <unk> on their projects .
It 's not going to <unk> all about this thing .
But the question I 'd like to <unk> is , why ?
Why do we don 't we in this way ?
Because it 's more than any other thing ever ever heard of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> process .
A process that , as anybody who ever <unk> to do something -- so , all here -- so , all here -- all of here -- you don 't know , you don 't <unk> <unk> .
And , in fact , it can <unk> .
I did this <unk> <unk> with the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , which has now now <unk> , but it 's been a <unk> for the <unk> , and he said that in his <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> , <unk> out in the <unk> , and he <unk> out in the <unk> , and <unk> , when the <unk> <unk> .
He said that was like a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And that <unk> <unk> to her <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , because he <unk> the land under his feet .
And I had one thing to do that point to do that point and was , words , " <unk> as a <unk> . "
And so I <unk> to go home and it was <unk> by this <unk> , and it didn 't have to <unk> a piece of paper and a <unk> <unk> in the <unk> , as the <unk> , and <unk> on the <unk> .
And sometimes I didn 't <unk> to be enough , so <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and she would <unk> the <unk> and she would <unk> to <unk> the <unk> and she would <unk> to <unk> through the <unk> , and she would have a <unk> . "
And then there were those times -- this piece of never -- there were not the time -- there were the time when the <unk> was almost <unk> , OK ?
So , was <unk> to home and he was looking at the <unk> and <unk> the <unk> through , and <unk> a <unk> <unk> in the <unk> , and he said , and he said , and he was like <unk> with the other hand and he was looking at the other hand , and he was looking at home .
<unk> <unk> <unk> from the tail and the <unk> in his body and the <unk> on the page .
And in these cases , the <unk> <unk> would be <unk> on the <unk> , and <unk> , but <unk> , the last word to the last word .
So when <unk> <unk> -- it 's <unk> , it 's <unk> , it 's exactly <unk> to my <unk> process .
I don 't know , my <unk> process -- they 're not a <unk> !
I 'm a <unk> , and my way , it 's <unk> ; it 's <unk> <unk> every day and <unk> and <unk> on <unk> .
But even I even , in my <unk> , I <unk> against that what ,
And I think that also many of you <unk> the <unk> .
You know , even if the work and ideas <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . I could not <unk> <unk> .
And what is this ?
And how can we <unk> to it in the way we don 't have the head , but rather , which <unk> <unk> <unk> ?
So as as a <unk> , the best example I <unk> that I have the <unk> <unk> <unk> , which I <unk> different years ago to a <unk> .
And I talking about this , and you know , <unk> , for the <unk> of life was the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , trying to <unk> these species of <unk> <unk> .
But then <unk> , <unk> , and a day , and a day , and a day , <unk> <unk> , <unk> everything for him .
And I 'm going to <unk> and everything of a <unk> <unk> , which is <unk> <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> , you know , it 's not like <unk> .
It 's not a piece of paper , not a <unk> , not a <unk> .
So , I 'm going to feel this species of <unk> <unk> in him in him , and <unk> <unk> from this <unk> <unk> .
I don 't have enough <unk> and I can 't <unk> . "
And instead of go in <unk> , they <unk> .
And <unk> the whole process of <unk> and <unk> something completely new .
And I just <unk> the sky and he said , " <unk> , you don 't see that I 'm <unk> ? "
" You know that it can write a song now ?
If you really want to <unk> , you 're going to <unk> , when I can <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> , <unk> to <unk> else else today .
<unk> <unk> <unk> . "
And his <unk> process after this .
Not the work , the work was still <unk> as always <unk> as always .
But the process , and the <unk> <unk> that <unk> was <unk> when <unk> <unk> <unk> , the <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> from where was <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> .
But <unk> this <unk> , wonderful <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> and this <unk> <unk> <unk> and this <unk> <unk> , but it was not <unk> .
So how <unk> that story to change a little bit about the way that I <unk> and <unk> me a time .
This idea , I was <unk> when I was <unk> , " <unk> , " <unk> , " and <unk> in a <unk> of those <unk> <unk> in which we 're working on something and we 're not going to think about something and we can think about something and we 're going to think about it , what the book I 'm going to be the book .
Not only <unk> , just the <unk> book .
And I think about <unk> this project .
But then I <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> to the air and <unk> .
So I <unk> my <unk> in the <unk> and <unk> my <unk> and <unk> my <unk> <unk> to a <unk> <unk> .
And I said , " <unk> , " <unk> , " <unk> , what we know if this book is not going to be <unk> <unk> my , no ?
Because you see me all of the <unk> that I 've got to the <unk> of this .
So if you want to have to <unk> and do your part .
OK . But if you don 't do it , you know what , you know , you know , you know , not .
I <unk> to write the same because it 's my work .
And I 'd like to do that I 'm going to do my part of my part , " because -- <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of Africa , <unk> , <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk> of Africa , and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to hours and hours .
And they were always <unk> , because the <unk> were <unk> and they were <unk> .
But every much , <unk> , something <unk> , and one of these artists <unk> in fact ,
And I know what you know , because I know what you all , because I know , a <unk> <unk> .
It was like if you know , and the <unk> <unk> through a species of <unk> and <unk> <unk> and was not doing anything different from <unk> , as the <unk> <unk> , but everything <unk> .
And at the <unk> not <unk> as a human .
But they <unk> from <unk> and <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of <unk> .
And when this <unk> , the time , people <unk> what was , the <unk> <unk> with his name .
<unk> your hands and <unk> <unk> , " <unk> , " <unk> , God , God , " God , God , " God , "
That 's God , you know .
<unk> <unk> -- when the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> this <unk> <unk> , <unk> this <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> in <unk> , " <unk> , " <unk> , " <unk> , " <unk> , " <unk> , " <unk> , " which you can 't see in the <unk> , " <unk> , " <unk> , " <unk> , " <unk> , " <unk> , " <unk> , " <unk> , " <unk> , "
In <unk> , when a artist has done something impossible and <unk> , " <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> -- a <unk> of God .
And it 's because we need .
But , the problem comes to the day after , the <unk> , when you <unk> and <unk> <unk> that are the 11 of God , and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
It 's just a <unk> with <unk> <unk> , and maybe not <unk> <unk> to that <unk> <unk> .
And maybe one <unk> the name of God , as <unk> , and what does do with the rest of his life ?
It 's difficult .
This is one of the <unk> <unk> to do in a <unk> life .
But maybe it has to be so <unk> if you 're <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , which the <unk> of your own being <unk> .
But I just just just <unk> data in <unk> <unk> from a <unk> <unk> of this <unk> part of your life that you have to go to another when you have to <unk> .
And , you know , if we think about this way .
And I started to <unk> , and it 's like the <unk> , I <unk> for different months in the <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk>
And what I have to <unk> when I feel <unk> , I feel <unk> from this is , not <unk> .
They 're not just <unk> .
They 're going to <unk> for your part , any can be .
If your work is <unk> , <unk> .
If the <unk> , you 're <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> some kind of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> some kind of <unk> , " <unk> ! "
<unk> , you do the same your <unk> .
And " <unk> ! " You know , " <unk> ! "
I think , and I think it <unk> .
" <unk> ! " You know , " <unk> , just for the same <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Thank you .
Thank you .
<unk> <unk> : <unk> !
As you know , I 've already talked about some of these projects on the human genome , on what we can <unk> and <unk> <unk> new <unk> of genes .
Now we 're <unk> a new <unk> , we started to <unk> the biology and now now now , we 're <unk> in a new <unk> of biology , <unk> and <unk> life .
We always have to <unk> <unk> great questions .
" <unk> is the life ? " is something that many <unk> <unk> I think they have <unk> to understand <unk> .
We tried different <unk> , <unk> to the <unk> terms of <unk> .
We 're <unk> by almost 20 years .
When we <unk> the human genome <unk> <unk> to <unk> from the world of the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> of the computer .
Now , we can <unk> the life , or create new life , or create new life from this universe ?
This is the map of a little <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , which is the species from the <unk> <unk> in the <unk> .
And we tried to <unk> the genome for <unk> a <unk> <unk> , and more <unk> .
We can <unk> a <unk> of genes of about 500 genes that are about 500 genes that are here .
But when we have a look at his <unk> map , is <unk> <unk> <unk> , is <unk> <unk> <unk> to our <unk> .
<unk> , this is simple .
But when we look at all the genes we can <unk> , one at the time , is very <unk> that can <unk> this <unk> <unk> .
So I <unk> that the only <unk> <unk> <unk> this <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And so we started the <unk> of " We can <unk> a <unk> <unk> ? "
It 's the <unk> <unk> of these big molecules that we 've never been to to create before ?
And , in case , we can make it work a <unk> <unk> ?
A <unk> is just a piece of <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The speed that we 're able to <unk> life life is <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Our ability to write the code , instead of <unk> , instead , but it 's <unk> .
And our <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
We have <unk> more than 15 years ago .
The process has <unk> a lot of <unk> , <unk> with a <unk> <unk> before <unk> the <unk> experiments .
But we found that <unk> <unk> is very difficult .
There are <unk> of thousands of machines that <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> of <unk> , <unk> <unk> , and it 's a process : the most <unk> is the <unk> <unk> , more <unk> .
And so we had to develop a new <unk> to these <unk> and <unk> the <unk> .
And this was our first <unk> , to <unk> , to <unk> <unk> <unk> .
It 's a little <unk> that we <unk> bacteria .
We <unk> the <unk> , <unk> the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The interesting part is when we <unk> this piece of <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> , and we <unk> the bacteria have <unk> to read this <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> are <unk> from cells , they 're <unk> by cells , and they <unk> <unk> <unk> .
I talked about <unk> <unk> <unk> that they have <unk> <unk> this model .
They have more than you .
And what this is a situation where the software can actually build the same <unk> in a <unk> system .
But I <unk> to do the most <unk> in big .
We wanted to build the whole <unk> of <unk> .
They 're more <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
So we thought we thought about <unk> <unk> <unk> of the size of the <unk> , so we can change the <unk> to understand what the <unk> is <unk> .
The <unk> is <unk> , and if we <unk> information in a computer , these have to be very <unk> .
When I <unk> this genome for the first time in the <unk> <unk> <unk> was a <unk> for every 10 <unk> <unk> .
We found , <unk> , 30 <unk> . If we had <unk> that <unk> never <unk> that <unk> <unk> never <unk> to do it .
A part of the process is <unk> <unk> <unk> 50 <unk> <unk> that <unk> with all the other <unk> <unk> to build more <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
It 's <unk> elements here .
You 've got to read that <unk> <unk> .
<unk> so : We have a <unk> <unk> <unk> on four <unk> : <unk> , <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
And we <unk> <unk> together about 20 <unk> , and there 's a <unk> <unk> <unk> for every <unk> <unk> .
So we can use the <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
What we did at the beginning was <unk> .
And there was <unk> by the fact that it was not <unk> .
We had these <unk> <unk> <unk> with <unk> .
There are <unk> that <unk> them and <unk> them .
And we started to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . <unk> with <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> in the way to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
In the <unk> , we 've got these <unk> in so <unk> <unk> that we 're <unk> to create a <unk> <unk> as you 'll see in a minute .
We 're trying to <unk> the process .
So , this seems the <unk> of a <unk> <unk> .
When I <unk> to these <unk> <unk> , more than 100 <unk> , we don 't <unk> to <unk> in the <unk> <unk> .
It 's <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> biology .
So we <unk> other <unk> .
And I <unk> from another <unk> called <unk> <unk> , which in biology <unk> <unk> <unk> the DNA that can <unk> the <unk> <unk> .
That 's a example .
This <unk> <unk> , called <unk> , can <unk> three million <unk> <unk> .
You can see in the <unk> <unk> as his <unk> <unk> .
In 12 hours , it 's just <unk> as before .
And we 're going to do that .
These organisms can <unk> .
They 're going to live in <unk> .
They 're all that life <unk> in space , and they <unk> to find new <unk> <unk> <unk> of water .
And that 's the true , the <unk> has showed that this is .
This is a <unk> image of <unk> that we built using these <unk> , just using <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> them .
This image was not <unk> with a <unk> <unk> , but with a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
It 's a <unk> so big that we can <unk> with a <unk> <unk> .
These are <unk> <unk> a period of about six seconds .
This is the <unk> that we did a little time ago .
They 're more <unk> <unk> <unk> .
It 's the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
It 's a <unk> <unk> .
If you <unk> it with a <unk> 10 without <unk> , we <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . We just <unk> <unk> this <unk> <unk> .
Now , how do we do it work ? How can we <unk> ?
<unk> , <unk> with a <unk> .
It 's a little bit more <unk> when they use .
It 's more simple when it 's about cells as our : you can just <unk> the <unk> and <unk> another , which is <unk> the process of <unk> .
In <unk> <unk> <unk> is instead in the <unk> , but we <unk> <unk> <unk> that we can do a <unk> <unk> <unk> that we can do a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> from a <unk> <unk> .
We <unk> a <unk> <unk> from a <unk> species .
The two different as the men from <unk> .
We <unk> some <unk> in the more <unk> in the <unk> way to understand what this <unk> .
And the <unk> <unk> with the <unk> in the way to <unk> all the <unk> .
And when we <unk> in the <unk> <unk> , and <unk> our <unk> <unk> the new <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> the new <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And <unk> <unk> that we don 't go beyond , but we tried to <unk> more in there .
This is one of the most <unk> evolution of evolution .
We found that <unk> species have <unk> a second or a third , <unk> in a few part , <unk> in a second thousands of <unk> <unk> in the species .
So who think about evolution as a <unk> <unk> at time that <unk> doesn 't understand that much much of biology .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> the DNA .
The <unk> that was in the cell <unk> .
<unk> <unk> that we <unk> the <unk> .
It 's <unk> , and it <unk> the other <unk> as <unk> , the <unk> , and <unk> , and we 're <unk> with only the <unk> and the new <unk> .
It 's <unk> <unk> .
And in a <unk> <unk> of time , all the <unk> of a species are going to go , and it 's <unk> <unk> in a new species , <unk> on the software .
All the <unk> are <unk> , the <unk> are <unk> , and when <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> exactly exactly what we have <unk> .
Now , this could be <unk> <unk> , but we <unk> the <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> , but we can change the <unk> things in a <unk> .
Now , I 've already <unk> that here is not about <unk> -- but it 's <unk> to three million years and a half years and a half years , and I 've already said that maybe we 're going to create a new <unk> version of <unk> in which <unk> new <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> new <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in this process .
Why do do do that ?
I think it 's pretty <unk> when we think about our <unk> .
We 're going to go to six and a half of people in the next 40 years .
Right for a example : I 'm born in <unk> .
Now there are three people on the planet to <unk> <unk> in the <unk> ; there are four .
We 're <unk> problems now , water <unk> and <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , <unk> and <unk> for six billion people .
We still <unk> to do it for nine billion .
<unk> more than five billion <unk> , more than 30 billion 30 billion <unk> <unk> .
That means percent of <unk> <unk> .
When we 're trying to find <unk> <unk> , or any kind of process for <unk> , it will be a huge challenge .
In the most <unk> we <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> in the atmosphere .
<unk> day , thank you to the <unk> <unk> in the world , we have a <unk> with about 20 million genes , and I like to think that are the <unk> <unk> for the future .
The <unk> industry only a <unk> about <unk> , and think about how many different things are <unk> out .
Our <unk> here are <unk> data from the reality , and from our imagination .
Now we have <unk> <unk> , thank these <unk> <unk> <unk> , in <unk> <unk> , and we can create what we call <unk> <unk> .
We can make a big robot that can make a <unk> robot that can make a day .
Think of <unk> these 20 million genes or different genes or <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to produce <unk> or <unk> , new <unk> , we can change , <unk> , and create more <unk> biology , and create more <unk> biology in the last 20 years of science .
And it 's just a <unk> <unk> .
We can <unk> to <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
This is a <unk> of some software software software that we 're working for <unk> and <unk> species to <unk> and <unk> species to the computer .
Well , we don 't know how they 're going to be .
We know exactly how their <unk> .
Now we 're <unk> on the <unk> of <unk> generation .
You 've also seen you know that <unk> <unk> from the <unk> was a <unk> experiment .
We have <unk> <unk> , and the third generation that <unk> enough to <unk> <unk> <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> as the <unk> or different kinds of <unk> .
But the only way that biology can have a big impact . And the <unk> <unk> the food and <unk> the <unk> would be <unk> the <unk> of food and <unk> the <unk> would be <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> of the first <unk> of <unk> that we can <unk> to <unk> in the first generation .
The <unk> light <unk> with the <unk> is a <unk> <unk> , but in our <unk> <unk> in all , we found different <unk> .
This is a <unk> that we <unk> in the <unk> .
<unk> in the ocean , about <unk> feet of <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> from the <unk> using <unk> <unk> as <unk> .
We 're trying to understand if we can <unk> the <unk> <unk> , which can be <unk> by <unk> , <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> , to <unk> this process .
So , we think about being able to be able to <unk> what the question of " which is what the <unk> of " which is , we <unk> the <unk> <unk> the entire <unk> <unk> .
<unk> . If you can 't do that TED , where you can ?
It <unk> a <unk> of energy .
And we 're working working working for the same <unk> to create <unk> <unk> .
You 've seen this year with the <unk> , we 're always going back to the year and with a dollar in less when it 's <unk> <unk> .
I think what you can change <unk> <unk> in <unk> .
So , this is how to start <unk> , now , the tree of evolution , <unk> the <unk> evolution , <unk> , and <unk> cells .
We 're at so so <unk> , and we 're in the people .
Our goal is to do in the way to live enough to try to try to try to <unk> .
So , I 'm going to show you , the most <unk> of work , some <unk> , a <unk> of technology that we <unk> to <unk> a <unk> <unk> . This is <unk> . This is <unk> .
It 's a environment where you can <unk> is <unk> to the local level that <unk> with a huge amount of <unk> data .
Here we 're seeing <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> with a <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> , for a <unk> <unk> , <unk> the images like we want to <unk> the images like .
And it doesn 't matter how big the amount of information that we see , how the <unk> are <unk> of data or the images .
Most <unk> are <unk> <unk> , but this for example is a <unk> <unk> from the <unk> <unk> , and <unk> in <unk> <unk> .
It 's not no difference because the only thing that <unk> the <unk> of a system as this is the number of <unk> on your screen in any time . It 's also an architecture .
This is a whole book , example of data .
This is <unk> <unk> . And then it <unk> <unk> <unk> .
So , <unk> that 's just about the <unk> and not images , we can do something like like that , to see it is a real <unk> <unk> of the <unk> , not a picture .
It could be a little bit about <unk> for a book .
I don 't want to show it .
This is a <unk> example . It 's a <unk> number of the <unk> .
Every image is the beginning of a <unk> .
And it 's really the <unk> and the good experience of the <unk> version of a <unk> or a <unk> <unk> , which is to nature .
We also did something with the <unk> of this number in the <unk> .
We created a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> much more than the <unk> that you use in a <unk> <unk> and we <unk> <unk> <unk> .
If you want to see the <unk> of this <unk> , you can see here .
Or other models , or even <unk> <unk> .
And this really <unk> some of these ideas for <unk> the <unk> of the space of space .
And I think that <unk> this <unk> to the <unk> and other <unk> <unk> , not <unk> to be <unk> .
Of course , the <unk> is one of the most <unk> <unk> <unk> for this kind of technology .
And on this is not to want to <unk> time , if we 're not going to be in this <unk> .
These are all the streets in the United States in the <unk> <unk> .
So now I 'm going to do that .
This is actually actually by the <unk> ; you can <unk> to see .
It 's a project called <unk> , which <unk> two different technologies .
A <unk> is <unk> and the other is a very interesting research to the computer very interesting <unk> <unk> , a student of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And it 's from <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
You can <unk> when we do this kind of <unk> , where we can go from a image to the other and we have this kind of experience to <unk> .
But the <unk> <unk> of <unk> here has actually a meaning .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> are <unk> <unk> these images , in which <unk> <unk> all <unk> <unk> <unk> on the <unk> <unk> <unk> are <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . So , you see the <unk> of <unk> <unk> , and these things are all <unk> .
I don 't know if I 've been time to show you some other environment .
There are some more <unk> .
I want to go to one of the <unk> of <unk> data <unk> and this <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that we did work for the first time to show you what we did is the key <unk> to show you what it is really the key <unk> <unk> . And it 's not <unk> <unk> <unk> . And it 's not <unk> to <unk> the website .
We had to <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
This is a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> . And he <unk> <unk> <unk> of these <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
So , I 'm all <unk> images and you 're all <unk> <unk> in this way .
And it 's possible to <unk> this way .
You know , I would never thought to <unk> to work for <unk> .
It 's very <unk> <unk> this kind of <unk> here .
I think you see that is a lot of a lot of different kinds of <unk> : from those phones phones to those <unk> <unk> , a number <unk> , <unk> together in this environment .
And if I can <unk> to try to <unk> those <unk> <unk> .
Many are <unk> <unk> , and <unk> .
And then , the part here is a series of pictures -- <unk> .
This is a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
We can go from the <unk> of this environment .
The <unk> <unk> is that we can do about things with the environment . This is <unk> data from <unk> <unk> from the entire <unk> <unk> of <unk> as <unk> <unk> and <unk> all of <unk> <unk> and <unk> all of data .
All those <unk> are <unk> together , more than the <unk> <unk> .
You have a model of the Earth that <unk> .
Think about this as a <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> on the Earth <unk> <unk> .
It 's something that <unk> in the <unk> of the people , and the <unk> that <unk> the <unk> <unk> with the <unk> .
They 're <unk> with <unk> <unk> <unk> from other people .
If someone is the idea of <unk> all of these <unk> <unk> , my <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> . And I can use the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Of course , a <unk> of all , they 're <unk> <unk> <unk> of every interesting part of the land , <unk> not just <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> . And as as as as <unk> .
Thank you very much .
CA : I realized what your software software <unk> ? What your software software <unk> <unk> to do is that to do is that that in the next years , all the <unk> <unk> from anybody in the world .
<unk> : Yeah . What 's doing is doing it is doing .
It 's <unk> <unk> , if you want , between images .
And it 's doing it in the <unk> of images .
And the thing is very interesting if you think about <unk> information information that many of these <unk> <unk> .
As a research of images on the web , <unk> , <unk> a <unk> and the <unk> on the <unk> , and the <unk> on the <unk> <unk> .
Now , what happens if that picture you <unk> to all your <unk> picture ?
So the amount of <unk> <unk> and the <unk> of <unk> that <unk> is really <unk> . It 's a <unk> effect . It 's a <unk> effect .
CA : <unk> , it 's really incredible <unk> .
<unk> : I 'm going to <unk> .
One of the <unk> when you <unk> and one of the <unk> <unk> <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , who <unk> the past , <unk> in the <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
I think that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> , or that the <unk> <unk> are still <unk> or <unk> , or <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , to <unk> the <unk> of <unk> , and the idea that the idea that the idea that the idea that there is not just <unk> in the <unk> , but it is actually , but but it is actually actually actually actually actually ,
the <unk> of a particular <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> that our <unk> has done , and good ago , many <unk> ago .
And , of course , all of <unk> <unk> <unk> .
All <unk> . <unk> .
We 're <unk> <unk> .
We have to <unk> the <unk> of death , so we don 't <unk> <unk> if you <unk> and <unk> --
We all have a art art .
What <unk> is the <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> of <unk> every culture of <unk> every culture .
They don 't matter that the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , or the <unk> <unk> <unk> , or the <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , or a <unk> in the <unk> of <unk> .
He was my <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> a month ago , or a <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> ,
All of these <unk> <unk> that there are other ways of <unk> other ways of <unk> , other ways to think , other ways to <unk> in the world .
And , if you <unk> a minute , is a minute that can give you hope .
<unk> , the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> that <unk> the planet and <unk> that <unk> the planet and it is important for the <unk> <unk> as <unk> <unk> .
And you can think about this <unk> <unk> as a <unk> and you can <unk> the <unk> <unk> the <unk> of all the <unk> of the <unk> , <unk> ideas , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> ideas , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> ,
The <unk> is the <unk> of humanity .
It 's the <unk> of what we 're and what we can be in how <unk> <unk> .
And <unk> <unk> <unk> was <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> is success , and <unk> much more <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , for example , <unk> that 50 percent of all the species was or it 's <unk> , or it 's <unk> , or <unk> -- in the <unk> <unk> -- and <unk> in the <unk> of <unk> -- and not not even even even even even even even <unk> to the <unk> <unk> -- that <unk> in the <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> of all , that 's obviously , the <unk> <unk> .
When you 're <unk> <unk> on this planet .
A language is not just <unk> by a <unk> or a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
A language is the <unk> of human spirit .
It 's the middle with which the <unk> of every culture comes in the world .
Every language is a <unk> of the mind , a <unk> thinking , a <unk> thinking .
And of those <unk> <unk> , as we 're here in <unk> , at least the half the <unk> of the children .
They 're not more <unk> <unk> to kids , which means to say , to less than they 're already death .
What there 's more <unk> <unk> of being <unk> by the <unk> , the last last last to talk to the <unk> of the <unk> or <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> the <unk> of <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> <unk> ?
This <unk> <unk> was the <unk> of someone in some in the world every two weeks , every two weeks , and it <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of a <unk> language .
And I know that someone of you know , " is not better so better ?
The world would not have a better place if we all all the same language ? " <unk> , then we 're talking about <unk> .
<unk> <unk> .
And I think of a <unk> thing to talk about their language .
I 'd like to show you a journey through the <unk> --
a little journey in the <unk> <unk> for you a <unk> of what we 're <unk> .
Many of us <unk> that when I say , " different ways of <unk> <unk> .
And so for example , this <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> of <unk> , which <unk> <unk> <unk> from the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
It 's a <unk> that 's not able to <unk> the blue color from because the <unk> <unk> is <unk> in the <unk> , which <unk> <unk> <unk> .
They have a <unk> language and a <unk> <unk> , " <unk> <unk> " : you have to <unk> a person who 's a different language .
And all this <unk> in the past , but the <unk> is that in these families where they 're <unk> in these <unk> or seven <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> no language .
And they <unk> to talk about and then <unk> to talk .
I was a <unk> of the most interesting <unk> with which I 've been <unk> , the <unk> of <unk> <unk> , a <unk> that had the first <unk> in <unk> .
In the <unk> five <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> .
They did <unk> from the <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , which <unk> <unk> this <unk> <unk> <unk> , which this <unk> <unk> <unk> had never seen anything of <unk> .
They have <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . They <unk> to research a form or a <unk> <unk> , and they don 't <unk> anything , they <unk> <unk> <unk> , and they <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
But the <unk> not only <unk> the <unk> .
They 're <unk> between them .
<unk> percent of <unk> <unk> was <unk> by their same .
We 're <unk> to <unk> and we found two cases of death and we <unk> to know , they have <unk> that one of their <unk> was so that <unk> was so <unk> , and then they <unk> the same . And then they <unk> the same way , and then they have a <unk> .
<unk> were able to <unk> the animal <unk> from 40 <unk> and <unk> the species .
And I first <unk> , it was <unk> a very interesting <unk> when my <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , if I wanted to <unk> if I go to <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And so I want to <unk> , I would have to understand the culture <unk> and that the <unk> is not <unk> .
It 's pretty <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of the world .
<unk> <unk> .
If you <unk> <unk> the great <unk> of the world , what I <unk> ?
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> ,
A continent is always <unk> out , thinking that Africa <unk> <unk> . And instead of Africa is not another <unk> . And instead is not another that the <unk> of these <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
What makes the <unk> is the <unk> <unk> <unk> between life and death .
So the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> can be <unk> by <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
So , the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . You go to talk about God .
We <unk> in <unk> and God . "
And from the moment that you 're <unk> , is the spirit that you can you <unk> your <unk> ?
So , you know , <unk> <unk> in these incredible : <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a very <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And I all the <unk> with the <unk> that I 've been the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , in the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that once <unk> <unk> on the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
In a <unk> continent , this <unk> never been <unk> by <unk> .
And then , I 'm <unk> by a <unk> , but their <unk> is <unk> <unk> .
The young <unk> are <unk> <unk> from <unk> to three or four years , and live in <unk> , and live in a world <unk> <unk> and <unk> in <unk> <unk> <unk> to the <unk> <unk> for 18 years .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of <unk> that <unk> in the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
So , all this time , they 're <unk> to values , and they <unk> that their own <unk> and only their <unk> <unk> <unk> -- or to say , or to say the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> this incredible <unk> , they <unk> out and <unk> out and the first time in their life , and the first time , they see a <unk> . And in that moment of the first <unk> <unk> , when the sun <unk> <unk> <unk> , the <unk> of <unk> , what they have to know , what they have to <unk> <unk> <unk> .
" <unk> ? <unk> as I said .
It 's <unk> . Now it 's <unk> . "
They call <unk> <unk> , and they say that we <unk> <unk> , we are the <unk> of the world .
This is very important .
When we think about <unk> and the environment <unk> <unk> and the <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> story of <unk> , which is a <unk> <unk> in his <unk> or maybe <unk> <unk> and we say that these <unk> are more than we 're <unk> to the Earth .
<unk> <unk> are not <unk> or <unk> <unk> from <unk> .
There 's no space for these things in the <unk> of <unk> or in the <unk> <unk> <unk> , but <unk> to the time and <unk> , they have a <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> , but <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , which is the <unk> in the <unk> of the Earth is because the <unk> of the Earth is <unk> .
What does mean ?
And I mean that a <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> that the mountain is a <unk> <unk> that <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and it will have a different different <unk> and it will have a different <unk> with the mountain or that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And that 's the <unk> of a <unk> <unk> is <unk> .
What is the <unk> that <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> and the natural world .
I was <unk> in the <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> for being <unk> .
And so that <unk> me a human being different from my <unk> <unk> that believe that the <unk> are <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> that live in the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
If you <unk> to <unk> that these <unk> can create <unk> , we start to understand some <unk> <unk> . <unk> this <unk> <unk> .
I <unk> this picture at the <unk> <unk> .
Maybe some of you have heard of <unk> , the most powerful <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
What makes the <unk> is not the potential <unk> is not the potential <unk> <unk> , but his <unk> . It 's <unk> from two <unk> .
And then one side , this <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
<unk> the only <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . And I <unk> the <unk> , but it 's <unk> with the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
This <unk> <unk> <unk> , very like <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
If you 'll ever see the <unk> <unk> on the <unk> that they do from a different <unk> of species , <unk> <unk> .
<unk> that <unk> on the <unk> is a little bit like to be <unk> by a <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> on a <unk> of electricity . It doesn 't make a <unk> <unk> ; it doesn 't make a <unk> <unk> .
And I often with my <unk> , Richard <unk> <unk> , the man who <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> , with his <unk> <unk> in the <unk> .
My <unk> <unk> can 't <unk> these <unk> as <unk> because if you 're <unk> , you can 't tell you about no <unk> . <unk> <unk> <unk> , but they can 't be <unk> because they 're <unk> by a <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
It 's possible to <unk> <unk> if you <unk> with other <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> .
Now , the <unk> : <unk> that are <unk> <unk> in this <unk> are <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> : in a <unk> <unk> <unk> : in a <unk> <unk> <unk> : in a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , how to <unk> <unk> <unk> , but they 're going to be <unk> with a <unk> <unk> <unk> . But what does this <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . But if you 're <unk> <unk> <unk> .
We use the big <unk> of <unk> and <unk> , which can <unk> <unk> <unk> .
But if we <unk> <unk> , we <unk> <unk> , " The plants us . "
What does mean ?
This <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , which <unk> <unk> in the forest , and that <unk> in the forest species .
If you know , you know , if they <unk> <unk> <unk> , " <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , you don 't know all ? " I said , " No . "
The solution is , they <unk> <unk> in a night , <unk> <unk> in a <unk> , and <unk> <unk> with a different <unk> .
With this <unk> is <unk> <unk> , but it 's much more interesting that <unk> <unk> the <unk> .
Now , <unk> the problem is that the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> them , but in some of us that have to <unk> <unk> them , but in some <unk> <unk> of our world than our world than our world , and <unk> .
In fact , the <unk> century , in 300 years , not <unk> for his <unk> or <unk> <unk> , but rather as the <unk> <unk> <unk> , but rather as the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and the problem .
All the <unk> through the <unk> <unk> have been <unk> in a <unk> to new <unk> of life .
And the problem is not technology .
<unk> <unk> don 't have <unk> <unk> when they <unk> <unk> when they <unk> <unk> and <unk> as <unk> and <unk> as <unk> as the <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
It 's not the change or technology that <unk> <unk> <unk> . It 's the power of <unk> . It 's the power .
The <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And if you look at the world , <unk> that these are not <unk> <unk> to <unk> .
They 're <unk> <unk> out of the <unk> of the forces that go beyond their ability to their ability to <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of <unk> --
a <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> , a <unk> <unk> , a <unk> that <unk> <unk> in the forest to a generation , and now <unk> to the <unk> <unk> , where you can see the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , where you can see the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , where the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , where the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , where the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , where the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , where the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
I <unk> <unk> <unk> with the <unk> <unk> <unk> to the forest .
Or in the case of <unk> , are the diseases that are <unk> with the <unk> of <unk> .
If I <unk> <unk> on the <unk> , where I 'm doing a lot of research , you 'll see the <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
As <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , is <unk> <unk> to <unk> , but the <unk> , the <unk> of a <unk> , not only is not just <unk> , but <unk> in some of <unk> , because part of <unk> <unk> <unk> , because part of <unk> .
And you can 't understand the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> until you can 't understand the beginning .
I <unk> the <unk> miles from <unk> in China through the <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> with a young <unk> , but just <unk> <unk> <unk> , I realized what I <unk> <unk> to talk about .
<unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> million people <unk> from <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The father of this guy was <unk> to <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> that means that was <unk> to the <unk> days of the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> .
My mother was <unk> and his <unk> was <unk> .
It was <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> at the age of two years <unk> <unk> , because it would not live without him .
The <unk> , which has done the same , was <unk> in <unk> <unk> .
A day <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> and , for this <unk> , was <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> for seven years .
The <unk> <unk> can be <unk> , but the <unk> <unk> the <unk> of <unk> is <unk> <unk> .
And then , it <unk> to a choice .
We want to live in the world <unk> or we want to <unk> the world <unk> ?
The great <unk> <unk> , before the <unk> <unk> , before he said that his most <unk> <unk> was that , in our <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , not only <unk> the whole <unk> of human <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> of human <unk> <unk> , but a day , there was a day , it <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And it 's <unk> to remember that our species is <unk> for <unk> years .
<unk> <unk> , which <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , which <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> the <unk> of <unk> , <unk> the <unk> of <unk> , and we 're <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and talk about <unk> years ago .
The <unk> world <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And so that <unk> <unk> , we have the <unk> to all the <unk> that we <unk> in the <unk> to come in in <unk> .
When these <unk> <unk> of the world is asked what we want to say to be human , <unk> with different <unk> .
And it 's in these <unk> that we all <unk> the opportunity to be what we are : a <unk> species , which has to make all the <unk> and all the <unk> can <unk> . And there are great <unk> <unk> , there are great <unk> <unk> .
I <unk> this picture on the <unk> <unk> <unk> , when I went to <unk> <unk> with <unk> <unk> , and this man , and this man , <unk> me the <unk> <unk> .
The government <unk> was not always <unk> with the <unk> <unk> and in the ' <unk> and in the ' <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> of this man <unk> <unk> .
<unk> family , <unk> for his life , the <unk> <unk> , and all the <unk> .
They want to know that the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> , <unk> it .
<unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> were <unk> <unk> fish <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> of this man didn 't <unk> by night or <unk> <unk> <unk> .
It 's <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> and <unk> in their hand . When I <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
He <unk> <unk> on the <unk> of this <unk> <unk> and when <unk> <unk> , <unk> a dog , he <unk> a dog .
It <unk> the dog and <unk> a <unk> , with the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . <unk> a <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> .
<unk> talk about <unk> ? <unk> <unk> ? <unk> <unk> . And this , in different ways , <unk> is the <unk> of <unk> and all the <unk> <unk> <unk> and all the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and all the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> the government <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
It 's their new <unk> . It 's called <unk> <unk> .
It 's a <unk> <unk> . <unk> all the <unk> resources .
One <unk> example of how a <unk> can <unk> with his <unk> .
And , to end , I think it 's pretty <unk> at least who we had in these <unk> <unk> in these <unk> <unk> , which are not going to be all <unk> .
And for someone is home .
<unk> <unk> <unk> of the human imagination that <unk> to the <unk> of the time . And for us all of these children , as the <unk> of our children , they 're <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> .
So , we <unk> <unk> we <unk> <unk> we 're <unk> <unk> that the <unk> never <unk> anything .
<unk> <unk> --
<unk> <unk> , they don 't <unk> , but we believe that stories can change the world , and maybe we 're the best <unk> to tell the world of the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> our <unk> .
We <unk> <unk> are <unk> by millions of people .
Our work is <unk> in the <unk> to <unk> our audience in places of <unk> <unk> from which <unk> <unk> from which <unk> <unk> and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , and we have to find a <unk> <unk> <unk> in the world , and we have to find a <unk> <unk> <unk> in the world .
where the <unk> of all the <unk> can <unk> our <unk> <unk> .
Thank you .
I 'm going to talk to you some things that I was <unk> in this book that you 've already heard and <unk> some <unk> <unk> <unk> , in the case , not <unk> them .
I want to start with what I call the <unk> <unk> <unk> . "
<unk> <unk> <unk> ?
The <unk> <unk> of all the society <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> : " If we want to <unk> our own own own own own own <unk> . " And the way to do it is <unk> <unk> . "
The reason is , from a side , in fact , the freedom is <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , is <unk> , <unk> for human beings .
And then another is in fact that if we 're <unk> , all of us can do that for all that <unk> our <unk> .
The way to <unk> the freedom is <unk> .
The most <unk> people have , more <unk> , and more , and more , and more , and more than their <unk> .
This is so <unk> , it 's so <unk> in the society that nobody <unk> <unk> in <unk> .
And it 's also <unk> in our lives .
I 'm going to show you some examples of what the <unk> is possible .
This is my <unk> . It 's not particularly big .
I <unk> a simple <unk> on the <unk> <unk> .
In my <unk> <unk> , there are <unk> <unk> , <unk> the 10 <unk> of <unk> <unk> and the 12 <unk> <unk> that you can buy a huge <unk> <unk> in the <unk> that no one of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> is <unk> of your <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> is to your <unk> .
That 's what the <unk> .
And then you go to the <unk> <unk> : <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
And in this single <unk> <unk> , there 's a big number of <unk> <unk> .
We can make six million and a <unk> of different <unk> using the <unk> that there are in a <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> that there is <unk> choice .
<unk> <unk> <unk> : the world 's <unk> .
And once , when I was a child , they could get all the <unk> <unk> , <unk> that were <unk> <unk> .
They <unk> the phone , you don 't <unk> .
A <unk> <unk> of what the phone , the phone was that the phone never <unk> .
These days , they went .
We have a <unk> <unk> <unk> , especially in the <unk> .
That 's the phones of the future .
My <unk> is the <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> .
If you don 't have the <unk> in the <unk> , you 're going to be <unk> in the house ,
And what at the end is that people do in the <unk> and it does this question . And you know , is the answer ? The answer is , " No . "
It 's not possible to buy a phone phone that doesn 't <unk> things .
So , in other <unk> of life that are much more important than the <unk> , <unk> the same <unk> of <unk> , <unk> the same <unk> of <unk> .
<unk> <unk> : It 's not going on in the United States that you have to <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> you have to do .
Instead , <unk> from <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> you say , " OK , " OK , " Well , " <unk> , " <unk> , " <unk> <unk> , " <unk> <unk> these <unk> and these <unk> <unk> . "
You know , " <unk> , what do ? "
And the <unk> says , " <unk> these <unk> and these <unk> , and they <unk> these <unk> and <unk> these <unk> . "
" What do you want to do ? "
And you <unk> : " <unk> if she was , what do ? "
And the <unk> : " But I 'm not she 's not she . "
The result of the <unk> <unk> , " <unk> <unk> , " <unk> <unk> , <unk> that does it look like a good thing .
But actually , it 's not a <unk> <unk> the weight and the <unk> of <unk> <unk> , and it 's <unk> the <unk> , to <unk> the <unk> , and almost almost almost -- and almost almost <unk> -- and so , it 's not <unk> to make the patient .
There 's a huge <unk> of <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> to people like me and you , if you think it doesn 't <unk> .
But if we can 't <unk> , why do we can <unk> them ?
The answer is that they want to <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And we have to <unk> so the <unk> is a question of choice , as you see in this <unk> <unk> , " We don 't want to <unk> their <unk> . " We don 't want to <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> : we have to <unk> a <unk> <unk> : we have to <unk> .
And we can <unk> how many times we <unk> .
And the <unk> means that every <unk> , you have to have to <unk> that kind of person want to be .
I <unk> to the family and <unk> , a time the common perspective , almost for anybody , it was that you <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> , and they <unk> to make kids the <unk> .
The only choice was with who , and the <unk> , and that they 're not going to do after .
<unk> , all is really to play .
They 're going to <unk> to <unk> , and they <unk> their own own percent in less than a time .
And because they 're not less <unk> , because they 're not less <unk> .
But why are <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , " <unk> <unk> <unk> or no ? "
" <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> ? I have to think before kids or <unk> ? "
They 're <unk> <unk> .
And they 're trying to answer these questions , even if this <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and not <unk> <unk> <unk> and not <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And they have to do it . They 're important questions .
Now , the work : we 're <unk> , as <unk> <unk> , because the technology <unk> <unk> , every day , every day , and every day , <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , there is a <unk> , and I don 't tell you what the <unk> works .
I 'm not going to tell you , because I want to use it .
What it means , this incredible <unk> of choice that we have to work about it ? It 's what we have to <unk> , if we have to work or no .
We can go to our <unk> , with the phone <unk> , with the phone , the <unk> in a <unk> , and the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , on the <unk> .
And even if they 're all <unk> , every minute that we see our <unk> <unk> , we 're also <unk> , " I have to <unk> this called "
" I have to answer this <unk> ? I have to <unk> this letter ? "
And even when the answer is , " Well , that 's the experience of <unk> <unk> of your <unk> <unk> <unk> of your <unk> <unk> , very different in other conditions .
So , from any part , things we look at things , and <unk> , and <unk> , the <unk> , life is a <unk> of <unk> .
And a time the world was this : <unk> , there were some <unk> , but it was not a choice .
The world today <unk> to this : The <unk> is : " It 's a <unk> thing , or <unk> ? "
The answer is <unk> .
<unk> <unk> them all , so we know , so I 'm going to talk about those <unk> .
And we have this choice <unk> on people .
The first <unk> , <unk> , is that <unk> <unk> <unk> instead of <unk> .
With many <unk> in the <unk> that you 're very difficult to do .
I 'm going to show you a <unk> <unk> on the <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
A <unk> <unk> had access to the data of <unk> , the <unk> society of <unk> <unk> , with about a million <unk> in different <unk> .
What she was that for every 10 solutions that 's <unk> in the most <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
With 50 <unk> <unk> , there 's the 10 percent in less than when they 're <unk> <unk> . Why do they 're <unk> .
Because with 50 <unk> in which you 're going to understand , and the choice is <unk> to <unk> .
And <unk> , <unk> , and again , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and of course , you can never .
And I think that 's not just that these <unk> <unk> food food for <unk> because they don 't want to say that the decision is so <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of work .
They 're not <unk> , they 're <unk> to five <unk> <unk> <unk> for the <unk> of work , which would be <unk> to <unk> .
So the <unk> is a <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
And I think <unk> the world .
" And to end , to the <unk> : <unk> , <unk> or <unk> ? "
They 're going to take the right decision , if it 's the <unk> , right ?
You don 't want to want to want to want to <unk> the <unk> <unk> .
So this is the first effect . The second is that we can <unk> the <unk> and do a choice , to do we 're less <unk> by the result of <unk> as <unk> with less than <unk> in the <unk> of which .
And this for different reasons .
One of these is that with many <unk> between which you 're going to <unk> , and it 's not <unk> , it 's not <unk> , it 's not <unk> , it could do a different choice that would <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And even when it was a <unk> <unk> .
The most <unk> , there are , more than any <unk> <unk> of any <unk> <unk> .
And it 's what the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Dan <unk> <unk> <unk> very well as the value that we <unk> to things from what we have to <unk> things from what the <unk> .
<unk> , when there are many <unk> <unk> , is easy to <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> and being less <unk> <unk> and being less <unk> .
That 's a example . I <unk> with all those who are not in New York .
But it 's what you probably <unk> .
There 's this <unk> <unk> .
A place of <unk> .
<unk> <unk> . <unk> . It 's all for them .
It 's not <unk> . But that he 's : " Well , <unk> , it 's <unk> . "
" All my <unk> are on <unk> . "
" <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in front of the house . "
And it 's two weeks <unk> from the idea that 's <unk> -- every day -- the <unk> of <unk> where wants .
The <unk> <unk> <unk> for that we have , even when the choice was <unk> .
And the most <unk> that we have <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> as <unk> .
That 's another example .
This <unk> <unk> us a lot of things .
It 's about live the moment , and maybe in the live .
But the most important point is that you 're going to do , you 're <unk> , you don 't do other .
The things that we don 't have many <unk> that can make less than what we do .
<unk> <unk> <unk> .
I tried to <unk> on my <unk> a new new <unk> .
It 's almost always <unk> .
A time , the <unk> were a kind of just like , and <unk> <unk> , they were <unk> , and <unk> a lot of <unk> , and <unk> a lot of times , <unk> to go to go to go to go .
So , I <unk> to <unk> a new <unk> when those <unk> were , and I said , " I need a couple of <unk> , this is my <unk> . "
<unk> <unk> said , " You want to <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> ? "
You want to <unk> them with <unk> or <unk> ? " <unk> " <unk> , " or " <unk> ? "
" " "
" <unk> <unk> them want to <unk> or <unk> ? <unk> <unk> -- " <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . " <unk> <unk> <unk> .
I was <unk> , and after a little bit , I 'm going to say , " I want to say , " I don 't know , " he had no idea that was , so <unk> <unk> , and then a little bit of <unk> <unk> , and then <unk> <unk> , with the best <unk> <unk> .
It was <unk> .
But I 'll be <unk> .
Why ? I wrote a whole book for <unk> .
The reason I was about the <unk> is that with all the choice of my <unk> were <unk> , <unk> <unk> to be <unk> .
I had <unk> <unk> . I didn 't <unk> <unk> . I didn 't just <unk> when we <unk> <unk> 100 different , but when we <unk> 100 different different , at least a <unk> .
What I had <unk> was good , but not perfect .
And after I <unk> what I was <unk> in <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> in life of people don 't do that <unk> the <unk> that these <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And this <unk> less <unk> , when the <unk> are good .
<unk> in the world of the <unk> <unk> .
Because if you know , I 'm not <unk> to what I 'm talking about .
The truth to this .
" It was better when it was worse , " The reason that was better when it was <unk> as as as well as as <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> , in the world we live -- <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , the <unk> that we can <unk> is that things are <unk> to <unk> .
You 've never never <unk> because your <unk> , your <unk> , my <unk> , you 're <unk> .
The <unk> of happiness -- what you 're here -- that 's : " <unk> <unk> " Yes , " Yes , " Yeah , " Yeah , " Yeah , " Yeah , " Yeah , " Yeah , " Yeah , " Yeah , " Yeah , " Yes , " Yes , " Yeah ,
I mean -- little <unk> moment -- which are really <unk> and my wife is really <unk> .
I could not have to do better , I 'm not <unk> .
But <unk> not always <unk> . It 's a <unk> thing .
<unk> , a <unk> of you know , a couple of <unk> <unk> when there is just that when you 're not <unk> , and you 're not <unk> , and you say , " Why ? "
" Who is <unk> ? " " " <unk> is <unk> .
The world is the <unk> . What could you do it ?
When there are hundreds of <unk> , and you have a <unk> , and you <unk> a <unk> , and you 're <unk> who are you .
And I could do better .
With hundreds of <unk> <unk> , there are not <unk> for the <unk> .
So when people have <unk> , even if the result is <unk> , they <unk> <unk> and <unk> their own own own .
In the last years , the <unk> is <unk> in the world .
I think a <unk> <unk> -- not the only , but important -- this <unk> <unk> <unk> is that people have been <unk> because the <unk> are too <unk> .
And when they have to <unk> this situation that the <unk> is their <unk> .
So the final result is that we 're better , <unk> , but we <unk> <unk> . But we 're going to be better .
I 'm going to show you .
This is the <unk> <unk> , what we all <unk> for good and it 's completely <unk> . It 's not true .
There 's no <unk> that a little bit of choice is better than the best that we don 't have this <unk> . But it doesn 't <unk> to be better choice .
There 's a <unk> value , <unk> . I don 't know what it 's .
But I 'm sure we have <unk> from a piece of the <unk> of the <unk> that we <unk> our life .
Now , from the point of <unk> -- I 've been <unk> -- from the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> is the <unk> .
What <unk> the choice in the <unk> is the <unk> material .
There are many places in the world , and you know , <unk> <unk> , where the problem is not that they have <unk> choice .
The problem is that they have too <unk> .
So , the <unk> I 'm talking about is a <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> society .
And that does <unk> and <unk> is this : <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . And <unk> <unk> <unk> for <unk> . It 's a <unk> of money . It 's a <unk> <unk> . It 's a <unk> of money .
I mean that these choices , <unk> and <unk> , it 's not that they 're just <unk> .
They 're <unk> <unk> .
They do better .
If a little bit of what in our society <unk> <unk> <unk> in those where people have too much much <unk> , not only their life would not just have their life to <unk> , but also our own life to <unk> .
This is what the <unk> call a <unk> <unk> .
A <unk> <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> -- not only the poor -- because of this choice in <unk> that we <unk> .
So , to <unk> : You can become everything you want to do --
<unk> , people , " But what do ? " But what <unk> <unk> that fish ? "
" It 's <unk> that you can 't make anything in a <unk> of the <unk> . "
" A <unk> <unk> <unk> , a <unk> <unk> <unk> . "
and I <unk> the <unk> , so , in the beginning .
But then , <unk> , instead , I <unk> that fish knows that fish knows that fish knows the long <unk> .
Because the reality of the fact of the <unk> , in the <unk> , in the way that " <unk> the <unk> . " You can 't <unk> the <unk> . It 's <unk> <unk> .
If you <unk> the <unk> in the way that everything <unk> possible .
<unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> the <unk> .
They need a <unk> .
This is almost too <unk> , maybe maybe for the fish , and it 's <unk> for us .
But the <unk> of some <unk> is a <unk> for the <unk> and , <unk> , for the <unk> .
Thank you .
