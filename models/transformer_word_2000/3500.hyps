The last year I 've got these <unk> for <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , which for almost three million years had the <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , which <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> this <unk> <unk> of the problem because it 's not <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> is , in a sense , the heart heart of the global <unk> of climate system .
It 's <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The next <unk> will be a <unk> <unk> on the last 25 years .
<unk> <unk> are <unk> in <unk> .
You can see , you see it <unk> to blue blue .
That 's the ice in <unk> , which you <unk> in the summer .
You can see that the <unk> <unk> , of five or more , it 's like your <unk> , which is <unk> by the body .
In 25 years , it 's past , so .
This is a problem because the <unk> <unk> around the <unk> around the ocean around the ocean <unk> <unk> where there are <unk> <unk> , which , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> from <unk> <unk> <unk> , that <unk> <unk> , <unk> this point of <unk> , <unk> this point of not <unk> .
In some <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> is already <unk> from water .
The <unk> <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> ! <unk> : <unk> . The question is that 's going to be if you also <unk> .
One reason is that this <unk> <unk> <unk> from the <unk> <unk> from <unk> .
This is a <unk> river to <unk> .
The <unk> never never <unk> <unk> <unk> .
This is the <unk> river , in <unk> <unk> .
If you want to know how the <unk> <unk> <unk> on <unk> , and it 's <unk> to the ocean .
These are <unk> <unk> .
<unk> the other side of the planet : <unk> , the biggest <unk> of ice ice on the planet .
The month , the <unk> scientists have <unk> that the <unk> of ice is in <unk> , and that the <unk> <unk> , which <unk> on some <unk> <unk> , is really <unk> in <unk> <unk> .
<unk> at six feet of the <unk> <unk> , like <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , the third third <unk> of ice , you see new <unk> , that a few years ago .
The 40 percent of the world 's population <unk> <unk> from <unk> .
<unk> <unk> : This is the <unk> of the water <unk> of this city .
The <unk> is <unk> .
But when I <unk> , you know , the same thing .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> percent .
<unk> <unk> are in the crisis .
<unk> , as you have to read , they 're <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> in the world to a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> are <unk> <unk> out of the normal <unk> and without <unk> .
<unk> times more <unk> in the last 30 years of <unk> <unk> .
This is a <unk> of all <unk> .
If you can look at the context of the <unk> that you can see the <unk> .
In the last five years , we 've got <unk> million <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Look at the area of the <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , and on both <unk> , and on the <unk> of the <unk> , where there is a <unk> <unk> of oxygen in ocean ocean .
The most of the global <unk> , and <unk> , which is 20 percent , is the <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
The oil is a problem , and it 's <unk> .
The United States is one of the two countries with <unk> , and they <unk> to China .
And they 're going to build a lot of other <unk> <unk> .
But we 're <unk> to a <unk> of the direction .
These are the <unk> <unk> in the last last last years and some <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
And every way , there 's a <unk> <unk> in our country .
The <unk> of the <unk> and oil <unk> <unk> million dollars in the last year for <unk> <unk> <unk> , which is a <unk> .
<unk> image I was a <unk> --
<unk> <unk> , where I live , where I live , there was a <unk> of <unk> billion <unk> of <unk> .
Maybe you 've seen it on the <unk> .
This is the second <unk> of <unk> in America .
It 's happened around <unk> .
The <unk> of one of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of this .
<unk> : â™« <unk> <unk> is a kind of <unk> and happy .
It 's <unk> here in America , and it 's going to <unk> our economy .
<unk> the <unk> is more <unk> .
It 's <unk> , price , <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> here is a lot of the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> .
The biggest society <unk> on the <unk> is <unk> . This is his <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> : <unk> <unk> -- <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> -- not know what they 're talking about .
<unk> : So the <unk> for the <unk> <unk> <unk> two <unk> .
This is one of them , a part .
<unk> : <unk> : <unk> we see the changes <unk> as a <unk> <unk> <unk> to our business .
For this our <unk> is <unk> a big amount of money in a <unk> <unk> to make public <unk> for a <unk> to make public .
In fact , the <unk> is not <unk> .
We think it 's <unk> -- it also also also a good <unk> .
So , not <unk> of change .
We could do it .
<unk> : <unk> : <unk> <unk> -- you 've heard about a lot of <unk> .
So I was going to <unk> a structure of <unk> as the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> ! The machines are <unk> , but this is the sound of the <unk> of technology <unk> .
The <unk> of <unk> is between the <unk> of global global global global <unk> , but the technology technology of <unk> that you see everything .
<unk> at a look at a look at this is the <unk> <unk> of <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> , <unk> is in the crisis ; the economy , the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> crisis .
The <unk> that <unk> all : our <unk> <unk> by <unk> <unk> , like the <unk> <unk> <unk> , like the <unk> and oil <unk> .
But , there 's a new new <unk> , <unk> solution to <unk> .
<unk> America : 100 percent of energy <unk> , in 10 years .
A <unk> for <unk> America , <unk> <unk> , and to help <unk> the global global <unk> .
<unk> , a solution that we could solve our problems .
<unk> America .
<unk> : This is the last <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> is <unk> energy .
One of the <unk> ways of the end of the <unk> <unk> that we <unk> our planet .

<unk> <unk> : <unk> <unk> for places .
<unk> : <unk> America . It 's time to be <unk> .
<unk> : A old <unk> <unk> says , " If you want to go to <unk> , you want to go to <unk> , you want to go to go to <unk> ,
If you want to go to the <unk> , you . "
We have to go to the <unk> ,
Thank you very much .
The last year I did a <unk> <unk> on the <unk> .
And I 'm going to <unk> on how it works .
So , I was <unk> . And for the other time , there was the <unk> is the <unk> is the biggest experiment .
The <unk> is <unk> of <unk> that were <unk> less than a <unk> of the beginning of the universe -- to <unk> million times the beginning -- to <unk> million times the second .
All of this is just <unk> .
This is the machine <unk> .
I 'm going to these <unk> <unk> in the <unk> .
This is what I work . It 's called <unk> -- it 's <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> feet .
This is an <unk> image of <unk> in this is <unk> .
The 10 <unk> of last year we 've got <unk> the machine for the first time .
And this picture was <unk> by <unk> .
It was because of <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of control .
It 's an image of the first <unk> of the first <unk> of <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , with a part of <unk> , and <unk> <unk> in the <unk> .
In other words , when I <unk> that image of the 10 <unk> , <unk> that the <unk> machine , the <unk> <unk> .
I don 't know if it was this to <unk> to us more than that , or this <unk> <unk> on Google , and I <unk> the <unk> <unk> was this .
What means we had a <unk> impact on the <unk> .
And I was a week later , there was a problem with the machine , they had to <unk> these <unk> .
These <unk> <unk> <unk> when the machine works to the <unk> <unk> .
Now , the <unk> between you to you <unk> the <unk> and <unk> , " It 's not true . "
And they can do that because when they 're very <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
So , at less <unk> degrees , at a <unk> <unk> <unk> to that space in the stars , these <unk> can <unk> that <unk> .
In one of the <unk> between the <unk> of <unk> <unk> in <unk> , there was a <unk> of <unk> .
So the <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
This was the result .
Now , this is more <unk> if you think that these <unk> <unk> <unk> , and that you 're <unk> of about 30 <unk> .
They 're <unk> about 50 <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , what we did .
We have to <unk> and <unk> .
Now , they 're <unk> all to their place .
<unk> the end of <unk> <unk> will be <unk> .
<unk> , and we <unk> to get to <unk> data to <unk> or <unk> , and we can 't <unk> our <unk> to understand what the <unk> is the universe .
Now , of course , in a way , these <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> of the science and <unk> of <unk> . It 's easy easy to <unk> .
I think the fact that is so hard , the fact that it 's going to go to the <unk> , I think that 's the value of things like <unk> .
I want to <unk> with the words of one <unk> <unk> , which , <unk> , which <unk> , in <unk> <unk> <unk> , his <unk> <unk> , his <unk> <unk> <unk> , his <unk> <unk> <unk> , he was <unk> for the human <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> of the human ideas that are not <unk> that that are not <unk> , and they 're not going to <unk> ,
Thank you .
I want to start to <unk> <unk> to <unk> , when they <unk> <unk> with <unk> .
As <unk> as <unk> and <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , actually , and we could <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> is <unk> to the way that <unk> <unk> in which <unk> <unk> of the world around us .
So , from <unk> <unk> from <unk> <unk> of our <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and I started to my <unk> <unk> , and my <unk> <unk> <unk> , I started to <unk> , and I started to <unk> , and when we use a <unk> , instead of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> on the <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> ,
and <unk> to our <unk> ?
The question was so interesting that we could <unk> to explore the answer , <unk> .
In a few words , a <unk> is a <unk> computer like a <unk> .
In a few words , a <unk> is a <unk> computer like a <unk> .
You can <unk> them with your hand , " <unk> <unk> " between their <unk> , I think , and they have a screen and a screen and a <unk> .
But <unk> , I 'm <unk> objects , like <unk> , you can just <unk> .
The <unk> are the example of a new <unk> of tools for <unk> information .
And I <unk> as they <unk> , <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , and they <unk> hand , and they <unk> hand , and they <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , and they can <unk> to <unk> them , and we can <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> .
I 'm going to with some simple example .
This <unk> is <unk> to show you to show you , if you <unk> it in a direction , the video video <unk> so if you <unk> from the other <unk> .
These <unk> <unk> are <unk> <unk> of other .
If you <unk> them , you know what it 's going to do .
If they 're <unk> , you can <unk> a little bit .
If they 're <unk> , you can <unk> a little bit .
They also also have their movement and <unk> .
We are <unk> that one of the interesting of the <unk> of the <unk> that we could use <unk> <unk> <unk> , " <unk> a color like a <unk> . " <unk> <unk> " <unk> a <unk> .
In this case , we have three <unk> <unk> like <unk> <unk> and I can <unk> to <unk> <unk> and I can <unk> to <unk> <unk> .
and I can <unk> to <unk> <unk> in the color of the color , where you 're <unk> .
If you can <unk> a little bit of it , we can <unk> a place .
I 'm also also <unk> to <unk> , like the <unk> , <unk> , the <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> where people can try to do things , and <unk> the <unk> <unk> .
Now I 'm --
This is a <unk> of <unk> that I do with a <unk> <unk> .
Here we have a game of words that is a game of words that 's <unk> in <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> , at every <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> on every <unk> , <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> on every <unk> , and as <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> on a <unk> .
Then , after about 30 seconds , you have a new <unk> <unk> , and you have a new <unk> <unk> and new <unk> to try .
Thank you .
So here 's the children <unk> in <unk> <unk> , I 've done in the way that I <unk> them and I 've got a video .
They are <unk> very much .
And one of the things of this <unk> is that you don 't have to be people .
<unk> just say , " <unk> of words , " and they know what to do .
Here 's other people who who <unk> it .
This is our <unk> <unk> <unk> , there 's <unk> .
In fact , I wanted to <unk> .
They were just <unk> , for him .
Now , this is an <unk> <unk> of a <unk> <unk> .
<unk> to build a <unk> for the <unk> of <unk> .
It can <unk> new <unk> in the <unk> , <unk> their <unk> <unk> .
It can <unk> new <unk> in the <unk> , <unk> their <unk> <unk> .
So here 's doing the sun .
<unk> : The sun is <unk> .
David <unk> : Now , he has a <unk> in the <unk> .
<unk> : The <unk> .
<unk> work !
So I <unk> the <unk> and <unk> can make the <unk> <unk> --
<unk> : <unk> !
<unk> your story .
<unk> : <unk> !
<unk> : It 's a story with the <unk> , and you can understand how you <unk> .
<unk> : It 's a story with the <unk> , and you can understand how you <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> .
<unk> : The last example I 've been going to show you is a <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> and music .
It 's a <unk> , <unk> <unk> music , for <unk> and music .
The <unk> here is <unk> by <unk> like the <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> of these have four different <unk> , and you can can <unk> to <unk> that .
You can also <unk> these <unk> in a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And they just just <unk> a sound <unk> and a <unk> . "
These are actually that you can <unk> out of the <unk> and the <unk> .
I <unk> to a particular sound and then <unk> for <unk> .
And then there are the fact , you know , and they <unk> , you know , and they <unk> it <unk> to the whole <unk> .
<unk> like it works .
<unk> : <unk> : <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> in two <unk> <unk> , " <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
Now , I 'll go to a <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> : <unk> <unk> .
<unk> : And now I 'm going to <unk> the <unk> <unk> , so I can <unk> the <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> : I can <unk> the whole <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> of a side or another .
<unk> : And now I 'm going to <unk> the <unk> to <unk> to <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> : <unk> I can <unk> the <unk> . "
So I don 't have to <unk> before , but I can <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
And now , I can <unk> the whole <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . "
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is to build new <unk> <unk> <unk> more <unk> to how our brain is <unk> .
And today , I had time to show you one of this <unk> of this <unk> , and also some <unk> that we 're trying to get out from the lab .
The concept that I want to <unk> is that is <unk> this new generation of objects to <unk> with the media <unk> , which we 're going to do .
Thank you very much .
I can 't see the <unk> to talk to all .
I 'm a <unk> .
<unk> books is my <unk> , but it 's more than this ,
It 's also the love and my life .
And I don 't know what can change .
But , said this , something particular is <unk> in my life and my career , and my career , and my career , which <unk> me to <unk> the whole whole whole work .
The particular thing is that I <unk> this book , this <unk> <unk> called " <unk> , " <unk> , " which , " which , " which , I <unk> by my <unk> <unk> in the world and <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
And the result is that <unk> now , people <unk> me like if I was <unk> like <unk> .
<unk> -- <unk> , <unk> !
I 'm going to be <unk> and say , " You don 't think I 'm going to do better than you ?
You don 't know that I 'm going to write for all life without more to be able to create a book ? "
What can you <unk> to someone ? "
It 's <unk> , you know .
But it could go to the best , I remember that I remember that more than 20 years ago , when I was going to say , I was a <unk> -- I was a <unk> .
I <unk> to the same <unk> <unk> .
And people said , " Don 't <unk> to me ?
You don 't think that the <unk> <unk> you ?
You 're not going to be <unk> for all of life without anything that you know that anything you 've ever been <unk> and <unk> to a <unk> of dreams with your <unk> <unk> ? "
So you know , you know .
The answer -- the <unk> answer to all these questions is , "
And I think , I 'm <unk> of all those things .
I 've always had <unk> .
And I also have a lot of other things that people don 't have <unk> .
As the <unk> and other things .
But , as I think about what I thought I was going to say , why I was ?
Is it <unk> ?
It 's <unk> that anyone who who <unk> to be <unk> by a job that you 're going to do .
But what 's so that there is so that there 's so <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in a way that other <unk> don 't do ?
How my father , for example , he was a <unk> <unk> and I didn 't remember one time in his <unk> , and I didn 't know , if he was <unk> ?
It was never -- that -- that <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> , like ?
<unk> 't you so , <unk> ?
<unk> , the <unk> <unk> like group , they have not <unk> , in <unk> , <unk> the <unk> of being <unk> <unk> .
We <unk> , we have enough this <unk> , and not only <unk> <unk> , but we have this <unk> of being <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And I don 't want to look at the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> that , only in the <unk> century , and often often for them .
And even those who don 't have to be <unk> by their <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , before I was going to be <unk> , in the last <unk> said , " My book <unk> <unk> , " A incredible incredible incredible <unk> of life .
But we don 't <unk> when you know , because we 've heard these things so much at at the long time we 've been <unk> and <unk> the <unk> that creativity and <unk> the <unk> that art and <unk> are in some way that art and the art , to <unk> .
And the question I want to <unk> all here is : you 're going to <unk> .
I 'm going to go to this thing -- because they also <unk> by a <unk> of <unk> .
I think it 's <unk> .
And I think it 's also <unk> and I don 't want to <unk> <unk> in the next century .
I think it 's better better than our <unk> <unk> to live .
And I know , in my case -- in my case -- would be very <unk> to start to <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> in which I 'm in my my career .
<unk> -- you look at <unk> , I 've been a young , I 've been about 40 years .
I 've still about four <unk> of work in me .
And it 's very <unk> that any thing to <unk> at the world as the <unk> <unk> of the world as the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , because we all more or less friends here -- it 's <unk> that my big <unk> is to my big <unk> .
Oh , <unk> , who thought !
You know this is the kind of thinking that <unk> a person to <unk> <unk> to <unk> at the <unk> <unk> , and I don 't want to do it .
I love to do this work I love .
So , the question is , how ?
And so it seems to me , and so much <unk> , which the way to work to write a <unk> <unk> , right ?
I 've got to find a <unk> <unk> of <unk> in me , and I 'm <unk> , and my <unk> <unk> on what he <unk> <unk> to <unk> and I 'm going to get up and <unk> to see it out of how to do do it to find it to find the best ideas , if you 're going to find more ideas and <unk> , and we 're going to see that <unk> <unk> and <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> to help people to <unk> <unk> <unk> of creativity .
And that <unk> me to <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
because I went to <unk> and then <unk> back .
<unk> <unk> and <unk> -- people don 't think that the <unk> <unk> of <unk> who don 't believe that the <unk> of men , OK ?
It 's <unk> that creativity was this <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> to the men from a few <unk> and <unk> , for the reasons and <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> of these <unk> <unk> of creativity . "
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> of <unk> that <unk> <unk> from <unk> .
The <unk> were the same idea , but we were <unk> that species of the <unk> of the body .
The <unk> is <unk> , because the <unk> don 't really really <unk> that a <unk> was very <unk> .
And I think a <unk> was this sort of <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of a artist , a little like <unk> , and that <unk> <unk> to <unk> the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> , and that I 'm going to <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> of that work .
<unk> <unk> here , that 's the <unk> of which I talk -- that <unk> you <unk> you can <unk> you from the <unk> you can work .
And all <unk> that was so that I <unk> , right ?
So , artists were <unk> from <unk> things , like example , like example , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , and don 't ?
If your work was <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> all of the <unk> , all that I was <unk> by this <unk> <unk> <unk> .
If your work , you know , it wasn 't all your <unk> , right ?
All of <unk> that was your <unk> to be a <unk> .
And so people <unk> <unk> <unk> creativity in <unk> for very time .
Then the <unk> <unk> and all <unk> , and we put this big idea ; we put the human idea of the universe on the center of the universe and <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> without <unk> space to <unk> <unk> <unk> from the <unk> <unk> .
This was the <unk> of the <unk> and people to think that the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And for the first time in the history , you <unk> to <unk> this or that artist as a <unk> <unk> that I could <unk> a person with the <unk> .
And I have to <unk> , I think that was a big big <unk> .
I think I think I think you know , a simple person to believe that a <unk> like a <unk> like a <unk> like the <unk> , and the <unk> of all the <unk> , <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> is a big <unk> <unk> .
It 's like to someone to someone of the sun .
<unk> and <unk> completely <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
And I think it 's been this <unk> <unk> to <unk> artists in <unk> 500 years .
And if this is true , and I think that is , the question , and now ?
Can we we do it ?
I could come to a more <unk> of the relationship between human human relationship between human <unk> and <unk> .
Or maybe it 's not .
Maybe we can 't <unk> 500 years of thinking about 18 minutes .
And there 's probably people between the audience that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> on the <unk> of <unk> , you know , people <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> on their projects .
It 's not going to <unk> you all on this thing .
But the question that I 'd like to <unk> is -- why ?
Why don 't you know that ?
Because it has more sense of every other thing that ever ever heard to <unk> the <unk> of the process of the process of the <unk> process .
A process that 's <unk> that you 've ever been <unk> to do something -- so , so we 're not here -- so , you don 't know , <unk> .
And , in fact , it can <unk> .
I 've done this <unk> <unk> with the incredible <unk> <unk> <unk> , but that has been <unk> for the <unk> and he was a <unk> for all the life and said that in his <unk> <unk> <unk> in his <unk> , and he <unk> it in the <unk> , and when you <unk> <unk> in the <unk> .
He said that was like a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And that <unk> <unk> to her <unk> .
I <unk> it , because he was <unk> the land to his feet .
<unk> of have one thing to do that point and it was , his <unk> , his <unk> like a <unk> . "
And so I was home and he was <unk> by this <unk> <unk> , and it didn 't want to take a piece of paper and a <unk> <unk> <unk> , and a <unk> <unk> <unk> on the <unk> , and it 's <unk> on the <unk> .
<unk> times , you don 't get enough , so <unk> and <unk> and <unk> without able to come back to home and <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> and she would <unk> to <unk> through the <unk> and she would <unk> to <unk> through the <unk> , " another . "
Then there were those times -- this piece of never -- there were not <unk> -- there were <unk> , OK ?
So , he was <unk> home and he was trying to paper and the <unk> <unk> the <unk> through , and he was <unk> a <unk> in the <unk> , and he was <unk> , and he was like if you <unk> with the other hand , and then he was <unk> with the <unk> .
<unk> <unk> from the tail and his <unk> in his body and the <unk> <unk> on the <unk> .
And in these , the <unk> <unk> would be <unk> on the <unk> <unk> and <unk> , but at the last word to the first .
So when I <unk> <unk> -- it 's <unk> , it 's just <unk> to my <unk> process .
I don 't know my process -- I 'm not a <unk> !
I 'm a <unk> , and my way of <unk> is ; I 'm going to <unk> the same same <unk> every day and work on <unk> .
But I even , in my <unk> , I 've <unk> against that what ,
And I think that also many of you know , you know ,
You know , if the work and ideas I could <unk> <unk> to me from a <unk> <unk> .
And what is this thing ?
And how we can we <unk> to do it in the way we can 't take your head , but , we could <unk> <unk> ?
For how I was about about it , the best example I 've been <unk> <unk> , which I 've been <unk> different years ago to a <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> , and you know , <unk> , for the <unk> of life was the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , and trying to <unk> , trying to <unk> these species of <unk> <unk> .
But then I <unk> , and he was <unk> on a day as I was <unk> on a <unk> <unk> , <unk> all for him .
<unk> <unk> , and all of a <unk> <unk> of <unk> , which is <unk> in his head like <unk> , and it 's <unk> , and the wants , and the <unk> , and the wants , you know , but it 's not like <unk> .
It doesn 't have a piece of paper , not a <unk> .
So , I 'm going to feel this sort of <unk> <unk> in him in him , " I 'm going to <unk> , and <unk> <unk> from this song .
I don 't have enough <unk> and I can 't <unk> . "
And instead of go to the <unk> , they <unk> .
<unk> the whole process of <unk> and did something completely new .
<unk> just the sky and said , " <unk> , you don 't see that I 'm <unk> ? "
" You can see a song now ?
If you really want to <unk> , you know , you can <unk> to <unk> it .
<unk> , <unk> to <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> . "
And his process <unk> process after this .
I don 't work , the work was still <unk> like always .
But the process , and the <unk> <unk> that <unk> was <unk> when I was <unk> when I <unk> the <unk> , the <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> it was not going to be a <unk> thing , and it was <unk> <unk> , and <unk> .
But it was <unk> this <unk> , wonderful <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and this thing and this <unk> <unk> and <unk> that was not <unk> .
So how I <unk> that story to change a little bit of the way I <unk> and I <unk> me a time .
This idea , I was <unk> when I was <unk> " <unk> , " and I was <unk> , " and I was in a of those <unk> <unk> that we 're working on something and we 're working on something and we can 't think that it 's going to be going to think that the book .
I don 't just <unk> , just the <unk> book .
And I 'm going to think of <unk> this project .
But then I <unk> to me to <unk> air and <unk> it .
So I was <unk> my <unk> in <unk> and <unk> my <unk> to a <unk> <unk> of the room .
And I said , " <unk> , " <unk> , what this book is not going to be <unk> <unk> my <unk> , no <unk> , no <unk> my , no <unk> , no ?
Because you see I 'm going to be <unk> all that I 've been <unk> .
So if you want to have that 's better , you have to do your part .
OK . But if you don 't do it , you know what you don 't know what you know .
I 'm going to write the same because my work .
And I 'd like to like to me that I 've been <unk> to me to do my part of <unk> to do my <unk> . " Because it 's so , OK , OK -- <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> ,
And they were always <unk> , because the <unk> were <unk> and they were <unk> .
But every much , <unk> , something <unk> , and one of these <unk> <unk> in fact , <unk> .
And I know what I know , because I know , because I know that you all know , a <unk> <unk> .
It was like if the time you know , and the <unk> <unk> <unk> through a kind of <unk> and it was not doing anything of different from <unk> , like <unk> , but it 's <unk> .
And it 's not <unk> to <unk> like a human .
But you <unk> from <unk> and <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of <unk> .
And when this <unk> , <unk> , people <unk> what was , and people <unk> what was , he <unk> to his name .
<unk> your hands and <unk> to <unk> , " <unk> , God , God , God , God , God . "
That 's God , you know .
<unk> <unk> -- when the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> this <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> , " <unk> , " <unk> , " <unk> , " <unk> , " <unk> , " <unk> , " <unk> , " <unk> , " <unk> , " <unk> , " <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , " <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , " <unk> <unk> <unk> , " <unk> , "
In <unk> , when a artist has done something impossible and <unk> , " <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> -- one <unk> of God .
And it 's because we need .
But , the problem is the day after , for the <unk> <unk> , when you <unk> and <unk> that are 11 of the <unk> of <unk> and God is no more .
It 's just a <unk> with <unk> <unk> , and maybe you never <unk> to <unk> that <unk> .
And maybe one <unk> the name of God , and so that it 's going to do with the rest of his life ?
It 's difficult .
This is one of the <unk> <unk> to do in a <unk> life .
But maybe it 's not to be so <unk> if you could not believe , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you
But I just just <unk> you to show you from a <unk> <unk> of this <unk> <unk> of your life that you have to go to another when you have .
And , you know , if the think in this way .
And so I started to <unk> , and it 's <unk> like I 've been <unk> for different months in the book that I was <unk> to the book that I was <unk> in my <unk> .
And that I have to <unk> when I feel <unk> by this is , I feel like this is not <unk> .
<unk> .
<unk> to <unk> your <unk> , any of any of your <unk> , can be .
If your work is <unk> , <unk> .
If you <unk> , you <unk> to you <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> some of <unk> , for a moment through your <unk> , and I <unk> ! "
<unk> , you do the same your <unk> .
And " <unk> ! " <unk> . "
I think I 've been <unk> .
" <unk> ! " <unk> to you , even just for the same , even for the same <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Thank you .
Thank you .
<unk> <unk> : <unk> !
As you know , I 've already talked about the human <unk> , on what you can <unk> and <unk> about what we can <unk> and <unk> <unk> of genes .
Now we 're going to <unk> a new <unk> : we started to <unk> the biology and now now , we 're <unk> in a new <unk> of biology , and <unk> life .
We always tried to <unk> great questions .
" <unk> is life ? " It 's something that many <unk> I think they have to understand <unk> .
We 've got different <unk> , <unk> to the <unk> <unk> .
We 're <unk> by 20 years .
When we have <unk> the human genome <unk> to go from the world of biology in the world of the world .
Now we can <unk> us , or create life , or create <unk> <unk> , or create this <unk> universe ?
This is the map of a little <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , which is the species of the <unk> of the <unk> that can <unk> in the lab .
And we tried to <unk> the genome for <unk> <unk> to <unk> a <unk> .
We 're able to <unk> a <unk> of genes of <unk> <unk> <unk> .
But when we have a look at his map <unk> , it 's <unk> simple than our <unk> .
<unk> , this is simple .
But when we look at all genes that we can <unk> , one at one time , it 's very <unk> that this can <unk> to a <unk> <unk> .
So I thought the only one on the only <unk> this <unk> <unk> <unk> in the way of these questions .
And so we started the <unk> of the " We can <unk> a <unk> ? "
It 's <unk> <unk> to produce these big <unk> that we never 've never ever ever to create before we 're not going to create before ?
And , in case , we can make a <unk> ?
A <unk> is just a piece of <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> that we 're able to <unk> life is <unk> <unk> .
Our ability to write the code , instead of <unk> , but it 's <unk> .
And our <unk> <unk> <unk> on a <unk> <unk> .
We 've got more than 15 years ago .
The process has <unk> many <unk> , <unk> with a <unk> <unk> before we <unk> the first <unk> .
But we found that that you found that you know ,
There are <unk> of thousands of machines at the world that <unk> <unk> <unk> , of <unk> <unk> of DNA , <unk> <unk> , and it 's a process <unk> , and it 's a process of <unk> , and it 's <unk> .
So we had to create a new <unk> to <unk> these <unk> and <unk> the <unk> .
And this was our first <unk> , <unk> from the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> .
It 's a small <unk> <unk> that we can <unk> .
We have <unk> <unk> , <unk> the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> a <unk> of DNA <unk> <unk> .
The interesting interesting is when we 've got this piece of <unk> <unk> and we <unk> it in the bacteria , the bacteria have <unk> to read this code and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> are <unk> <unk> from cells , they 're <unk> back and they <unk> the <unk> <unk> .
I talked about the <unk> of the industry <unk> that they have of course , this model .
They have more than you .
I think this is a <unk> in which software software can actually build his same <unk> in a <unk> system .
But I 'm going to do the more things .
We wanted to build the whole <unk> of the <unk> .
I 'm more than <unk> <unk> <unk> .
So we thought we thought of <unk> in the size of the <unk> , so we can change the <unk> to understand what they 're the <unk> of a <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> is <unk> , and if we <unk> to information information in a computer , these have to be very <unk> .
When I <unk> this genome for the first time in the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
We found , <unk> , 30 <unk> <unk> . If you could <unk> that <unk> that <unk> <unk> that <unk> never to work .
One of the process is <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> with all the other <unk> of the other <unk> of 50 <unk> to build more <unk> that together .
<unk> <unk> <unk> here .
You know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know you know ,
So we have a code code <unk> <unk> on four <unk> : <unk> , <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
<unk> of those <unk> <unk> together <unk> <unk> <unk> , and there 's one <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
So we can use the code to say , <unk> , <unk> .
What we 've done was <unk> .
Some of the fact that was not <unk> .
We have these <unk> <unk> to just <unk> <unk> with <unk> .
There are <unk> that they <unk> them and <unk> them .
And we started to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> with <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
For every step , we 've got these <unk> in <unk> so <unk> <unk> that we 're <unk> to create a <unk> <unk> like you in a minute .
We 're trying to <unk> the process .
So , this seems the <unk> of a <unk> of <unk> .
When I <unk> to these <unk> <unk> , we <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , not more than 100 <unk> .
It 's <unk> to <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> biology .
So we 've got other <unk> .
<unk> of another <unk> called <unk> <unk> , which in biology <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Here 's a example .
This <unk> , called <unk> <unk> , can <unk> three million <unk> of <unk> .
You can see in <unk> <unk> as his <unk> <unk> .
In 12 -- it 's about 12 hours is just like before .
<unk> thousands of organisms that are able to do that .
These organisms can <unk> completely .
<unk> live in <unk> .
I 'm absolutely sure that life <unk> in space , and they 're going to find new <unk> of water .
<unk> to say the true , the <unk> <unk> that this is that this is .
This is an image of <unk> that we built these <unk> <unk> , just using these <unk> , just using <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> them <unk> .
This is not been <unk> with a <unk> <unk> , but with a <unk> <unk> .
It 's a great <unk> that we can <unk> with a <unk> <unk> .
These are pictures that I 've been <unk> a time about six seconds .
This is the <unk> that we 've done .
I 'm more than <unk> <unk> <unk> .
It 's the most big <unk> of a <unk> <unk> .
It 's a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
If you <unk> with a <unk> 10 <unk> <unk> , we <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Now , how we do we do it ? How can we <unk> ?
<unk> , with a virus is a game game from kids .
It 's a little more <unk> when you use of the bacteria .
It 's more simple when it 's about cells as our : you can just <unk> the <unk> and <unk> another , which is the <unk> of <unk> .
In <unk> <unk> <unk> is instead of <unk> in the <unk> , but we <unk> <unk> that we 're able to do a <unk> <unk> of a <unk> <unk> <unk> of a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
We have <unk> a <unk> <unk> of a species .
The two different <unk> that men from <unk> .
We have <unk> some <unk> in the way to decide that we could <unk> to <unk> this <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> with the <unk> <unk> all of the <unk> .
And when we put in the <unk> <unk> and <unk> our <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> the new <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And I <unk> that we don 't have to go to the <unk> , but we 've got to <unk> more in there .
This is one of the most <unk> of evolution .
We found that <unk> species have <unk> a second or a third <unk> <unk> from some of <unk> , <unk> in a second thousands of <unk> <unk> in the species .
So who think about evolution as a <unk> <unk> to the time you know , you know , the most of biology .
<unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> DNA .
The <unk> that was in the <unk> of it .
The <unk> <unk> that we <unk> it .
It 's <unk> , and it 's <unk> the other <unk> like <unk> , <unk> <unk> , and it 's <unk> with only the <unk> and the new <unk> .
It 's <unk> <unk> .
And in a <unk> <unk> of time , all the <unk> of a species are <unk> .
All the <unk> are <unk> , <unk> , and when I <unk> the code <unk> <unk> , and when we <unk> the code .
Now , this might look at <unk> , but we can <unk> the <unk> <unk> the software we can change things things in a <unk> .
Now , I 've already already already here is not about <unk> <unk> -- but it 's going to build three million years and a half years , and I 've already said that maybe we 're <unk> to create a new <unk> <unk> <unk> in which we 're <unk> new <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Why do do that ?
I think it 's enough enough to our <unk> .
We 're going to go to six billion people to <unk> billion in the next 40 years .
So , to give you a example : I was born in <unk> .
Now , there are three people on the planet to <unk> <unk> ; they 're going to be four .
We 're <unk> problems now , <unk> water and <unk> and <unk> , <unk> and <unk> for six billion people .
<unk> more <unk> to do it for nine billion .
<unk> more than five billion billion billion billion <unk> ,
That means million <unk> of <unk> .
When we 're trying to find <unk> <unk> , or any kind of process for <unk> , it will be a huge challenge .
In the most we have to <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> <unk> from these materials that <unk> in the atmosphere .
At day , I 'm going to <unk> <unk> in the world , we have a <unk> with about 20 million genes , and I like that that the <unk> <unk> to the future .
The industry <unk> only one of <unk> , and you think about how many different things are <unk> .
Our <unk> here are data from the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> and our <unk> .
Now we have <unk> , thank you to these <unk> <unk> <unk> , and we can create what we call <unk> <unk> <unk> .
We 're able to build a big robot that can produce a million <unk> .
Think of <unk> these 20 million genes or <unk> to <unk> the <unk> to <unk> the <unk> to produce or <unk> , we can change , <unk> , new <unk> , we can change , and create more <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and to create more <unk> biology in the last 20 years .
And it 's just a <unk> <unk> .
We can 't have to <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
This is a <unk> of software software that we 're working to be able to be able to be able to be able to <unk> and <unk> species to a <unk> .
Well , we don 't know how they will be .
We know exactly what the <unk> is their code .
Now we 're <unk> on the <unk> of the <unk> generation .
You 've seen you also saw from the <unk> <unk> from the <unk> was a <unk> experiment .
We have <unk> <unk> of the second and the generation that <unk> <unk> enough , <unk> <unk> <unk> , or different kinds of <unk> like the <unk> or different kinds of <unk> .
But the only way that biology can have a big impact without <unk> <unk> the cost of food and <unk> the <unk> would be <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> , which we 're working on the <unk> <unk> that can <unk> to <unk> cells that can <unk> to the first generation of the first generation of the <unk> of the <unk> ,
The <unk> <unk> with the <unk> is a <unk> <unk> , but in our <unk> all , we found different <unk> .
This is a <unk> that we 've <unk> in <unk> .
<unk> in the ocean , <unk> <unk> feet of <unk> <unk> <unk> of water .
<unk> <unk> from <unk> <unk> <unk> like <unk> <unk> <unk> like <unk> energy .
We 're trying to understand if we can <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> , that can be <unk> by <unk> , to that <unk> <unk> <unk> , to <unk> this process .
So , we think about the <unk> that we could be able to <unk> what the question of the <unk> of the <unk> of " that 's life is , we have the <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> . If you can 't do that TED , where you can 't you to do it .
It 's the main thing to the energy .
<unk> , we 're working working to use <unk> to create <unk> <unk> .
You 've seen this year with the <unk> , we 've always back to a year and a dollar dollar dollar dollar a dollar .
I think what you can change <unk> <unk> in <unk> .
Here 's how the future could start to be <unk> , now , the <unk> tree , <unk> the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , and finally <unk> cells .
We are so so by the <unk> people .
Our goal is to do in way to make enough to try to try to try to try to try to try to <unk> .
So , I 'm going to show you , the <unk> possible possible , some of the new technology that we 've got to <unk> in the <unk> <unk> , a year ago . This is <unk> .
It 's a environment environment that you can <unk> is <unk> to the local level of data .
Here we 're seeing <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> with a kind of <unk> <unk> and <unk> , for a <unk> <unk> , and <unk> the images like we want .
And it doesn 't matter how much much the amount of information that we see , how much much of data or the images .
The most of the <unk> are <unk> <unk> , but this example is a <unk> <unk> from the <unk> of the <unk> , and <unk> in the <unk> of <unk> ,
It doesn 't do any difference because the only thing that <unk> the <unk> of a system like this is the number of <unk> in your screen in your screen in any of your <unk> .
This is a whole book , example of data is not <unk> .
This is <unk> <unk> <unk> . Every <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
So , it 's just about the <unk> and not about images , we can do a thing about that , to see that it 's about the real <unk> of the real <unk> , not a <unk> <unk> of a picture .
It could be a way to be a little bit of <unk> to read a book .
I don 't have to <unk> .
This is a <unk> example . It 's a number of the The <unk> .
Every image is the beginning of a <unk> .
And it 's really the <unk> and the good experience of the real thing of a <unk> or a <unk> , which is to a <unk> , which is for nature .
We also have done something in the <unk> of this number of the <unk> .
We have a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> much more than that you can use in a normal <unk> <unk> and we 've <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
If you want to see the <unk> of this <unk> , you can see here .
Or other models , or even <unk> <unk> .
And this really <unk> some of these ideas to <unk> the <unk> of space .
I think this <unk> <unk> to <unk> and other <unk> like this <unk> <unk> , not more to be <unk> .
Of course , the <unk> is one of the <unk> of the <unk> of technology .
And on this don 't want to say , if we don 't say we have to <unk> to this <unk> .
These are all the streets in the U.S. <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
So , now I 'm going to do something else .
This is actually <unk> from the Web ; you can <unk> to see .
It 's a project called <unk> , which <unk> two different technologies .
A <unk> is <unk> and the other is a very interesting <unk> to <unk> <unk> , a <unk> <unk> of <unk> , one student of the <unk> of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And it 's been in the <unk> , <unk> from <unk> .
You can <unk> when we do this kind of <unk> , and we can go from a image to another image of experience to <unk> <unk> .
But the <unk> <unk> of images here has actually a meaning .
<unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> , and they <unk> these images , in the way that <unk> to the places that <unk> all the <unk> <unk> <unk> on the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . So , you see the <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> or <unk> , and these are <unk> , and these are <unk> <unk> .
I don 't know if I 've been going to show you some other environment .
There are some much more <unk> .
I want to go to one of the data of data <unk> <unk> and this <unk> from a <unk> <unk> of <unk> that we 've done for the first time the first time to show you what we 've been really <unk> in this <unk> <unk> , and that 's not so much much <unk> . And it 's not <unk> <unk> .
We had to <unk> of the <unk> and saying .
This is a <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> images of images in <unk> , and he 's <unk> <unk> <unk> .
So , I 'm <unk> <unk> <unk> and you 're all <unk> at the <unk> level in this way .
And it 's possible to this way .
You know , I never thought to work to work for <unk> .
It 's very <unk> <unk> this kind of <unk> here .
I think you can see that that is a lot of different kinds of different <unk> : from those <unk> <unk> , a number number , a number number , <unk> together in this environment .
And if I can <unk> to <unk> those more <unk> .
<unk> are <unk> by <unk> , and <unk> .
So , I 'm going to be a series of pictures -- <unk> .
This is a <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> .
We can <unk> by the <unk> of this environment .
The <unk> is that we can do about things with the social environment . This is now <unk> data from the whole <unk> of the <unk> of how we <unk> <unk> and <unk> all of <unk> <unk> and <unk> all of <unk> .
All the <unk> of the <unk> together , more than the <unk> of the <unk> of the parts .
You have a model of the land that you have a model of the land that you have to <unk> .
Think about this as a <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> on Earth <unk> .
It 's something that <unk> in <unk> , and the <unk> that people <unk> it , and the <unk> that you know that I <unk> <unk> with the <unk> .
They have <unk> <unk> with <unk> <unk> from other people .
If somebody is the idea of <unk> all these <unk> <unk> , my <unk> <unk> <unk> , my <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in that space , and then I can use the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , and they have a social experience .
Of course , a <unk> of all , they 're <unk> <unk> <unk> of every interesting interesting <unk> of the land , and it 's not just from <unk> and <unk> , but by <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> .
Chris Anderson : I realized ? What 's what your software <unk> <unk> to do is that that your software <unk> to do is that that , in the next next next , all of the <unk> <unk> of anyone in the world ?
<unk> : Yes . What 's doing in fact is doing in .
It 's <unk> , if you want , between images .
And it 's doing it in the <unk> of images .
The thing is very interesting if you think about <unk> information information that many of these images <unk> .
As a <unk> of images on the Web , you know , you know , you know , and the <unk> on the <unk> <unk> of information about the <unk> .
Now , what if that picture is going to all your picture of your <unk> ?
So , the amount of <unk> and the amount of <unk> that <unk> is really huge <unk> . It 's a <unk> <unk> .
CA : <unk> , it 's really incredible .
<unk> : I 'm going to tell you .
One of the <unk> when you <unk> and one of the <unk> of <unk> <unk> is the <unk> that we don 't have the <unk> <unk> <unk> , between who 's the past , in the <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> ,
<unk> think that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , or that the <unk> <unk> <unk> , or that the <unk> <unk> <unk> , or <unk> <unk> , or <unk> <unk> <unk> , or <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> , or <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> , and that the idea that the idea that 's idea that we don 't know , but it 's <unk> in the sense of the <unk> <unk> , but it 's <unk> .
And the <unk> of a particular <unk> of <unk> <unk> that our <unk> <unk> , well , well , well , many <unk> ago .
And , of course , all of the <unk> <unk> .
All of <unk> .
We are <unk> to <unk> <unk> .
We have to <unk> the <unk> of death <unk> , so you don 't <unk> and <unk> --
We all have an art .
What I think <unk> is the particular <unk> of the song of the <unk> of every culture .
<unk> 't matter that that are the <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> , or <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> , or <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> , or a <unk> of <unk> , or a <unk> <unk> in the heart of the <unk> <unk> .
He was my <unk> of journey in <unk> <unk> a month ago , or a <unk> of <unk> in <unk> <unk> , on the <unk> <unk> , on the mother .
All of these <unk> <unk> that there are other ways of <unk> , other ways to think , other ways to move in the world .
And if you <unk> a moment , it 's a moment , it 's a moment that can give you hope .
<unk> , the <unk> of the world 's <unk> <unk> and <unk> that <unk> the planet and <unk> that <unk> the planet and it 's important for the <unk> <unk> as <unk> <unk> as <unk> <unk> <unk> as <unk> <unk> .
And you can think about this <unk> <unk> like a <unk> <unk> and you can <unk> the <unk> <unk> the <unk> of all the <unk> of the <unk> , <unk> ideas , <unk> , <unk> ideas in human <unk> .
The <unk> is the great <unk> of humanity .
It 's the <unk> of what we can be in how we can we be in how we can we be in how to <unk> .
And <unk> the <unk> was <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> much more <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , for example , <unk> that 50 percent of all the species was or <unk> , or it 's about <unk> <unk> , because it 's <unk> , or <unk> -- it 's <unk> , or <unk> in the <unk> <unk> -- and you don 't even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
The <unk> of all is , of course , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
When you 're <unk> <unk> <unk> on this planet .
One of the language is not only from a <unk> or a series of rules .
A language is the human human human human human human human human human human human human human human human human human human human human human human human <unk> .
It 's the middle with which the <unk> of every culture is <unk> in the world .
Every language is a <unk> of the mind , a <unk> thought , a <unk> thought , a <unk> of <unk> .
And of those <unk> <unk> , as we 're <unk> here to <unk> , at least half the <unk> of the children .
They 're not more <unk> to children , which means , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , they 're already <unk> .
What 's more <unk> of the <unk> of being <unk> by the last last <unk> , to talk about the last last to a <unk> of <unk> or <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , or <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> or <unk> <unk> <unk> ?
This <unk> <unk> is the <unk> of somebody in some of every two weeks : every two weeks , every two weeks , and it <unk> <unk> with it <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And I know that somebody of you <unk> " not better so much ?
The world would not be a better place if you <unk> all the same language ? " <unk> , then we talk about <unk> .
<unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> to a <unk> thing to say , you can 't talk to their language .
I 'd like to give you a journey through the <unk> --
a little journey in <unk> to give you a <unk> of what we 're <unk> .
Many of us <unk> that when I say , " different ways of <unk> . " I mean , I mean , " really different ways of <unk> .
<unk> for example , this <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> , which <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
It 's a <unk> that is not able to <unk> the color color of the blue blue <unk> because the <unk> <unk> <unk> in the time , which <unk> the <unk> <unk> .
They have a <unk> language and a <unk> <unk> , " <unk> <unk> <unk> , " You have to <unk> a different person .
And this has <unk> in the past <unk> , but the <unk> is that in these families or seven or seven or seven to six or seven to <unk> <unk> , one language .
It 's going to talk to me and then I 'll talk to talk to talk .
<unk> one of the <unk> of the most interesting <unk> with which I 've been <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> that had the first <unk> in <unk> .
In <unk> five <unk> have <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> .
They 've done by the <unk> <unk> that they <unk> them in <unk> <unk> , <unk> that this <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> had never seen anything <unk> .
They have <unk> the <unk> <unk> , they <unk> to <unk> to <unk> <unk> to <unk> or a <unk> <unk> , and they don 't <unk> , they have <unk> <unk> <unk> , and they have <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> with <unk> .
But the <unk> don 't only <unk> .
They 're <unk> in their <unk> .
<unk> percent of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> from their own .
We are <unk> to eight <unk> and we found two of the death of the natural <unk> and when we 've got to know that one of their <unk> was so that that <unk> <unk> <unk> , and then they <unk> it <unk> .
<unk> were able to <unk> the animal from 40 <unk> by 40 <unk> and <unk> the species .
<unk> years , it was <unk> <unk> a very interesting <unk> when my <unk> <unk> of <unk> , when my <unk> <unk> <unk> , if I wanted to go to <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
For a sense of <unk> , I would have to understand the culture culture and that the <unk> is not <unk> .
It 's pretty much of a <unk> <unk> of the world .
<unk> interesting .
If you <unk> to you to <unk> the great <unk> of the world , what would you <unk> ?
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
A continent is always always <unk> out , thinking that Africa <unk> <unk> . And instead of it 's not another . And he 's not another that the <unk> of these <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
What makes the interesting is the <unk> <unk> between life and the death <unk> .
So the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> can be <unk> by <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> in the way that <unk> <unk> .
So , this <unk> <unk> to say " <unk> <unk> to talk to God .
We <unk> in <unk> and God . "
And the moment you 're <unk> , is the <unk> you can <unk> it .
So , you know , these incredible incredible <unk> : <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> all the <unk> with the <unk> that I 've been the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , in the <unk> <unk> <unk> , in the <unk> .
<unk> of the <unk> <unk> that once you <unk> on the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> on the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
In a continent of <unk> , this <unk> never been <unk> by <unk> by <unk> .
<unk> today are <unk> by a <unk> , but their <unk> <unk> is <unk> .
The young young <unk> are <unk> by three or four years , and they live in <unk> in a world of <unk> and <unk> in <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> <unk> for 18 years .
Two of <unk> years of the <unk> for <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , which <unk> <unk> in the mother , <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk> .
For all this time , they 're <unk> to <unk> <unk> to <unk> their <unk> , and they <unk> their <unk> <unk> -- or to their <unk> <unk> -- or to say the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> , they <unk> out of this incredible <unk> , and the first time in their life , at the time in their <unk> , they see a <unk> . And in that <unk> <unk> , when the <unk> <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and they <unk> <unk> in the <unk> theory in the <unk> <unk> .
" <unk> ? <unk> <unk> like I said .
It 's <unk> . Now , it 's <unk> . "
They call <unk> <unk> and they say that we , <unk> <unk> , we <unk> <unk> , we <unk> <unk> ,
This is extremely important .
When we think about <unk> and the environment <unk> and the <unk> <unk> <unk> , which is a <unk> <unk> , which is a <unk> <unk> in his <unk> or maybe <unk> and we say that these <unk> are more to Earth .
<unk> <unk> are not not <unk> or <unk> <unk> by <unk> .
There 's no space for these things in <unk> <unk> or in <unk> <unk> <unk> , but but thank you , to the time and to the <unk> , they have a <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> , but it 's <unk> <unk> <unk> , the concept that can live in the Earth is <unk> , because the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> .
What does that ?
<unk> to say that a <unk> of the <unk> that the <unk> <unk> <unk> that the <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> his <unk> will be a human <unk> , and it 's <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> or that place in the <unk> of <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
That 's the <unk> of one of a <unk> or a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
What is interesting is the <unk> that <unk> the <unk> between the <unk> and the natural world .
I 'm <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> to be <unk> .
What <unk> me to me a human being different <unk> of my friends <unk> <unk> that <unk> are <unk> <unk> and the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that live in <unk> and <unk> <unk> that they live in <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> that live in <unk> <unk> <unk> .
If you could <unk> that these <unk> can create very different , <unk> , I could start to understand some <unk> .
I 've got this picture of <unk> in <unk> <unk> .
Maybe some of you have heard about the <unk> , the most <unk> <unk> <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> .
What makes the <unk> is not the potential of the <unk> <unk> , but his <unk> .
And by the side , this <unk> <unk> that has a series of <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , <unk> .
<unk> the only <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . <unk> <unk> a little bit of the <unk> , but it 's <unk> with the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
This <unk> <unk> <unk> , very kind of <unk> , <unk> .
If you 'll see the <unk> <unk> to the <unk> <unk> <unk> that they do from a different <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
<unk> that <unk> on the <unk> is a little bit like to be <unk> by a <unk> <unk> of <unk> and <unk> on a <unk> of <unk> <unk> . It doesn 't make a <unk> of <unk> ; it 's actually <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> with my <unk> , Richard <unk> <unk> , the man who <unk> <unk> <unk> , with his <unk> <unk> , with his <unk> <unk> <unk> in 30 years .
My <unk> is not going to <unk> these <unk> <unk> like <unk> because if you 're not going to tell you to say , no one of the <unk> . <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> because they can 't be <unk> because they 're <unk> by <unk> <unk> <unk> because they 're <unk> by <unk> .
It 's possible <unk> <unk> if you could <unk> with other <unk> <unk> that <unk> the <unk> .
Now , the good thing : <unk> that they 're in this <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> of the same thing to <unk> the <unk> . The question is <unk> : <unk> <unk> : in a <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> : <unk> in a <unk> of <unk> , but they do not like these <unk> , but that if you can 't have <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> ,
We use the big <unk> of <unk> and <unk> , which can <unk> <unk> .
But if you <unk> to <unk> , we say , " <unk> <unk> . "
What does that ?
This <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , which <unk> <unk> in the <unk> , and that we could <unk> in the same species .
If I <unk> as <unk> their <unk> us to <unk> us , " <unk> <unk> <unk> , of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the <unk> , " No . "
The solution is , you have the <unk> <unk> in a night of <unk> <unk> , and <unk> with a different <unk> .
And so you don 't have to <unk> , but it 's much more interesting interesting that <unk> the <unk> .
Now , <unk> the problem is that even the problem is that they have to the heart heart <unk> them , but in some way that they <unk> them , but in the <unk> of our world <unk> of our world , and over the <unk> .
In fact , the <unk> century , <unk> <unk> for his <unk> or <unk> <unk> for his <unk> or his <unk> <unk> , but as the <unk> was in which we <unk> and we <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> . Now , <unk> <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> of the planet . Now , it 's not the change . Now ,
All the <unk> through the <unk> <unk> have been <unk> in a new <unk> to <unk> new <unk> .
And the problem is not the technology .
<unk> <unk> don 't have <unk> to be <unk> when they put from <unk> and <unk> as they <unk> <unk> , and so as they have <unk> <unk> when they put <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
It 's not the change or technology that <unk> <unk> <unk> . It 's the power of the power .
The <unk> <unk> of <unk> .
And if you <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> that these are not <unk> <unk> to <unk> .
I 'm <unk> and <unk> out of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> that they go to their ability to <unk> .
<unk> that <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> --
<unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , a <unk> <unk> , a <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> , and now now <unk> to a generation ago , and now <unk> to the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , where you can see the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , where the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , where the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , where <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , where <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , where the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> to <unk> the <unk> with the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Or , in the case of <unk> , I 'm <unk> with the <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> .
If you <unk> on the <unk> of the <unk> , where I 'm doing many <unk> , you 'll see the <unk> of <unk> .
As <unk> the <unk> , the <unk> of a <unk> , but the <unk> of a <unk> , but the <unk> of the <unk> of life of a <unk> , not only is <unk> , but <unk> <unk> <unk> , but it 's not only <unk> , but it 's <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> .
And you can 't understand the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> at the beginning .
I 've got to <unk> miles from <unk> in <unk> <unk> <unk> , but only they <unk> with a young <unk> , but only they had to <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> million people <unk> from <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The father of this guy was <unk> to <unk> <unk> .
The that means that it was <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> .
<unk> mother was <unk> and his <unk> was <unk> .
It 's been <unk> of <unk> in <unk> age of two years of two <unk> <unk> , because it didn 't have to live without him .
The <unk> , who did the same , it was <unk> in the <unk> of <unk> .
A day was <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and , for this <unk> <unk> , and it was <unk> to the <unk> <unk> for seven years .
The <unk> can be <unk> , but it 's <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> .
And then it 's all <unk> , all of a choice .
<unk> live in the world of <unk> or we want to <unk> the world of <unk> ?
The great <unk> <unk> , before the great <unk> said that his most <unk> was that his <unk> <unk> , in our <unk> <unk> , and we have a <unk> <unk> <unk> the whole <unk> of human <unk> <unk> of human <unk> <unk> <unk> of human <unk> <unk> <unk> , but there was going to be <unk> <unk> that they were other <unk> .
And it 's <unk> to remember that our species is <unk> for <unk> years .
The <unk> <unk> , which has us to <unk> , which has <unk> us to the <unk> <unk> , <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> with the <unk> <unk> , to <unk> the <unk> of <unk> , and we talk about <unk> <unk> , and we talk about <unk> <unk> <unk> , and we talk about <unk> <unk> <unk> , and we talk about <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and we talk about <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> world has to <unk> <unk> 300 years .
And that <unk> <unk> me , we have the <unk> to all the <unk> <unk> that we have the <unk> to come in in <unk> .
When these <unk> of the world is asked to say what he 's <unk> to be human , <unk> with <unk> different <unk> .
And that 's in these answers that we all <unk> to be what we all know , a kind of <unk> , that we have to make that all the <unk> and all the <unk> can <unk> <unk> . And there are great <unk> .
I 've got this picture on the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> , and this man , and this man , and this man , and this man , he <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The government <unk> was not always <unk> with the <unk> <unk> and in the ' <unk> for <unk> , we have <unk> in <unk> .
The <unk> of this man <unk> <unk> .
The family , <unk> for his life , and they <unk> all the <unk> , and all his <unk> .
You know that the <unk> don 't <unk> the <unk> , you know , you know that .
The <unk> of the <unk> were <unk> of fish <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> of this man didn 't <unk> by night or <unk> by the night or <unk> <unk> .
It 's <unk> , you know , you know , <unk> <unk> <unk> in your hand . When I did it , and they <unk> it <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
He has <unk> <unk> on <unk> of this <unk> of <unk> and when <unk> <unk> <unk> , he <unk> a dog .
It 's <unk> the dog and created a <unk> , with the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> , he has a <unk> , and it 's <unk> on <unk> , and it 's <unk> on <unk> ,
<unk> to talk about <unk> ? <unk> <unk> . And this , in different ways , <unk> , <unk> is the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> and all the <unk> <unk> of the world .
<unk> <unk> <unk> the government has <unk> to <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> of an area of <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> together .
It 's their new <unk> . It 's called <unk> .
It 's a <unk> . <unk> all the resources .
One example of how a <unk> can <unk> with his <unk> .
And , I think it 's pretty <unk> at least at least who 's been in these <unk> <unk> , <unk> that they 're not going to be <unk> all .
For somebody is home .
<unk> of the human <unk> that <unk> to the human <unk> . And for us , the dreams of these children , like our children , as our children , they 're <unk> of the hope .
For us , we <unk> <unk> we 're <unk> that the <unk> <unk> never <unk> .
<unk> that <unk> --
<unk> <unk> , they don 't know , but we believe that stories can change the world , and maybe we are the best to tell the stories of the world of the world .
<unk> <unk> <unk> our <unk> .
Our <unk> are <unk> by million people .
Our work is <unk> in <unk> to <unk> our audience in <unk> <unk> of <unk> from which <unk> <unk> from the <unk> that they saw and <unk> , and <unk> , <unk> <unk> for the <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> in the world , and we have to find a world in <unk> , and we have to find a world .
where the <unk> of all the <unk> can <unk> to our <unk> <unk> .
Thank you .
I 'm going to talk about some of things that I 've been going to talk about other that you 've already heard about other <unk> , in the case , and they <unk> them to <unk> them .
I want to start to start with what I call " <unk> <unk> . "
The <unk> <unk> of what ?
The <unk> of all the society <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> : " If we want to <unk> the <unk> of our own own own own own <unk> . " The way to do it is <unk> <unk> . "
The reason is , from one side , in fact that the <unk> is <unk> , <unk> , is <unk> , <unk> for human beings .
<unk> is another in fact that if we 're <unk> , each of we can <unk> , all of us can do what we 're going to do , no no one that <unk> in our <unk> .
The way to <unk> the <unk> is <unk> to <unk> the choice .
The most <unk> people have , and they have more , and more , and the most of the <unk> , is their <unk> .
This is <unk> , it 's so <unk> <unk> in society that nobody <unk> to <unk> in <unk> .
And it 's also <unk> <unk> in our lives .
I 'll show you some examples of what the <unk> can .
This is my <unk> . It 's not very big .
I <unk> a simple simple <unk> on the <unk> to <unk> .
In my <unk> <unk> , I 'm <unk> , without <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that you can buy for a huge number of <unk> in <unk> <unk> that you can buy one of the <unk> of <unk> in <unk> <unk> , which you can 't have to your <unk> .
This is what the <unk> .
Then you go to the <unk> <unk> for you to buy one <unk> : <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
And in this single <unk> of <unk> , there is a big number of <unk> .
We can make six million and a half of different <unk> using <unk> that there are in a <unk> .
<unk> <unk> that there is <unk> choice .
<unk> <unk> : The world of the <unk> .
And once , when I was a child , you could get all the <unk> <unk> , <unk> that they were <unk> by <unk> .
It 's <unk> the phone , you don 't get it .
One of what , between the other , the <unk> , it was that the phone never .
These time I 've got .
We 've got a <unk> <unk> of <unk> , especially in the <unk> .
Here 's the future of the future .
My <unk> is what in a half , <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> for the <unk> <unk> .
If you don 't have the <unk> in the <unk> , you 've seen in the <unk> , you know , if you can <unk> .
And what 's the end of the end is that people <unk> in <unk> and this question . And this question . And this question is the answer ? The answer is "
It 's not possible to buy a phone that doesn 't do things .
So , in other <unk> of life that are much more important than <unk> , you know , the same <unk> of choices .
<unk> <unk> : It 's not going to be in the United States that you have to <unk> you know what you have to do .
Instead , <unk> from <unk> , and the <unk> says , " OK , we could do , or we could do , or " <unk> , " <unk> , " <unk> <unk> these <unk> and these <unk> <unk> . "
You know , " <unk> , what do you do ? "
And the <unk> says , " <unk> <unk> these <unk> and these <unk> , and he <unk> these <unk> and these <unk> . "
" What do you want to do ? "
And you <unk> , " <unk> if she was me , what would you know ? "
And the <unk> : " But I 'm not she 's not she . "
The result of the <unk> <unk> , " <unk> that <unk> it 's like a good thing .
But in fact , it 's not that one <unk> <unk> the weight and <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> , and you know , <unk> the <unk> , <unk> , and it 's not not not -- and so in <unk> .
There 's a huge <unk> of <unk> <unk> , <unk> to people like me and you , and you , if you think that you don 't think we can 't <unk> .
But if we can 't <unk> , why do you get them ?
The answer is that they want to <unk> the <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And we have to the fundamental like , our <unk> is a question of choice , as you can 't want to <unk> the children . " We don 't want to <unk> the children to the <unk> . " We don 't have more <unk> : we have to <unk> .
And we can <unk> how many times we can <unk> .
The <unk> that means that every <unk> , you have to <unk> that kind of person you want to be .
<unk> to the family and <unk> , a time the common <unk> , almost almost almost for anyone , it was going to be able to make the <unk> .
The only real choice was with who , and even when , and even what you can do .
<unk> , all is really really to play .
<unk> to students very much , and they <unk> their <unk> percent in less than a time .
And because they 're not less <unk> , because they 're not less <unk> .
But why I 'm <unk> , <unk> to <unk> , " <unk> <unk> or not ? "
" <unk> <unk> <unk> .
I 'm <unk> .
And they 're trying to answer these questions , even if this <unk> <unk> <unk> , and they don 't get a <unk> <unk> to my <unk> .
And they have to do that . I 'm important questions .
Now , the work : we 're <unk> , like <unk> <unk> , because the technology is going to work every day , every day , every day , every day , every day of the planet , and every day , and every day of the planet ,
<unk> <unk> , there is a <unk> , and I don 't say one to nobody , where the <unk> works .
I don 't say , because I want to use that .
What means , this incredible <unk> of choice that we have about the work of work ? It 's we have to <unk> , if we have to work , or not .
We can go to see our son to <unk> , with the phone in a <unk> , the <unk> <unk> in the other , and the <unk> , and the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> on the <unk> .
And if I 'm all <unk> , every minute that we see our <unk> , we 're also <unk> , " I 've got to be able to to be able to to to the this called "
" I 've got to <unk> this <unk> ? I have to <unk> this <unk> ? "
And when the answer is " no , this is not , this <unk> experience of your <unk> of your <unk> <unk> , which would be in other <unk> .
So , by any part , and we look at the big things , and <unk> , life is a question of choices .
And once the world was this : <unk> , there was some chance , but it was not a question of choice .
The world of today , <unk> is , <unk> is , or <unk> , " It 's a <unk> thing , or <unk> ? "
The answer is <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> them , so we all know , so I 'm going to talk about the <unk> .
<unk> this choice is two two two , you know , you know , <unk> to them .
The first , <unk> , it 's <unk> <unk> .
And so we have to <unk> , it 's very difficult to do it .
I 'll give you a example of <unk> : one of <unk> <unk> on <unk> <unk> <unk> .
A <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , with data <unk> , the <unk> society of <unk> , with <unk> <unk> <unk> , with about a million <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> .
What she found it was that for every 10 <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> of two percent .
With 50 <unk> , there is the 10 percent in less than <unk> when they 're <unk> , they 're <unk> five ?
Because with 50 <unk> in the <unk> of what you can <unk> to <unk> , and the choice is <unk> to <unk> .
And at <unk> , and again , and again , of course , <unk> , and of course , you never have .
<unk> that doesn 't only mean that these <unk> <unk> <unk> food for <unk> because they don 't have enough money , even , even that the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of work .
<unk> , they 're <unk> to five <unk> <unk> for five <unk> of work , that would be <unk> <unk> .
So the <unk> is a <unk> of the <unk> to have <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And I think I <unk> the world so .
" And I would you to end , to the <unk> : " <unk> or <unk> ? "
You can just take the right , if it 's the right ?
You don 't want to to <unk> the bottom , and you can 't want to <unk> the right <unk> .
So this is the first effect . The second is that you can <unk> to <unk> the <unk> and make a choice , and to make a choice , and we 're less <unk> with <unk> <unk> <unk> in which is less <unk> in which is less <unk> with the <unk> of what you have been <unk> with the <unk> .
And this for different reasons .
One of these is that with many <unk> in which you can 't <unk> a <unk> and it 's not a perfect choice , is , it 's easy to do a different choice that was better . And that 's the better . And that 's what happens is the better , and the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> ,
So , when it was a <unk> .
The most <unk> , there are , more than any <unk> of any <unk> that is <unk> of the choice .
<unk> , there is what <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> so well as the value that we call things things from what we have to <unk> things that <unk> .
<unk> rest , when there are many <unk> . It 's easy to <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> that is <unk> of the <unk> that is <unk> , and it 's less than the <unk> .
So , this is a example . I 'm not about the <unk> that are not in New York .
But it 's what you probably probably <unk> .
There is this <unk> to <unk> .
A place of <unk> .
<unk> . <unk> . <unk> <unk> . It 's all for them .
It 's not nothing . But that he said , " Well , <unk> , it 's <unk> . "
" All my <unk> to <unk> . "
" <unk> <unk> <unk> . "
And it 's two weeks , <unk> from the idea that 's <unk> -- every day -- the chance to <unk> where you want .
The <unk> <unk> for that that we have , even when the choice was <unk> .
And the <unk> that we have from <unk> , more <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Here 's another example .
This <unk> says us a lot of things .
It 's about the moment , and maybe of live in <unk> .
But the most important thing is that you <unk> , you 're going to do that , you can 't do that .
The things that don 't have many <unk> that can make it less <unk> what we do .
<unk> <unk> : <unk> <unk> <unk> .
I tried to my <unk> <unk> <unk> a new <unk> .
<unk> almost always <unk> .
A time , they were a kind of only , and they were <unk> and <unk> by <unk> , just after <unk> , and they were <unk> a lot of <unk> , and they were <unk> to go to go to go to go to go to go to it .
So , I went to <unk> a couple of when I was <unk> , and I said , " I 've got a couple of <unk> , this is my <unk> . "
The <unk> said , " I want to <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> ? "
You want to <unk> or <unk> ? " <unk> ? " <unk> or <unk> ? "
" <unk> them want to <unk> ? "
" <unk> them to <unk> or <unk> ? <unk> <unk> <unk> -- " <unk> to <unk> .
I was <unk> , and after a little bit of that I want to say , " I want to say , " I want to say , " I didn 't know what was so <unk> <unk> . And then I was so <unk> . And then I was going to <unk> it .
It was the <unk> . And I had to <unk> the better .
But I 'm going to be <unk> .
Why ? I asked a whole book for <unk> .
The reason I was that that with all of the choice of my <unk> were , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
I had <unk> <unk> . I didn 't <unk> anything of <unk> when they <unk> <unk> . But when they <unk> it was a different <unk> , but when they had to be a perfect .
What I had a good thing , but not a perfect .
After <unk> what I was <unk> to <unk> in <unk> .
The <unk> of <unk> in life of people don 't do that <unk> the <unk> that they have <unk> to the same .
And this <unk> less <unk> , even when the <unk> are good .
<unk> in the world of the <unk> <unk> .
Because if you <unk> , I don 't know what I 'm talking about .
The truth to this .
" It was better when he was better , " The reason that was better when you know , it was better when he was <unk> possible .
<unk> , in the world we live -- <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , the <unk> that we can <unk> is that things are <unk> that we can <unk> <unk> things .
You 've never never <unk> because your <unk> , because your <unk> , you know , my <unk> , you know , my <unk> .
The <unk> of happiness -- what you 're here -- that 's , " <unk> <unk> " Yes , " Yes , you want . "
I mean -- small moment -- I 'm really <unk> -- I 'm really <unk> and my wife is really <unk> .
I could not have better , I didn 't have better to me .
But I don 't always have to be a <unk> .
<unk> , a <unk> of you can 't have a couple of <unk> when there 's just that kind of <unk> is that when you 're not going to you , and you 're not going to you , and you 're not going to you ? "
" Who is <unk> ? " " <unk> <unk> .
The world is the <unk> . What I could you to do you ?
When I 'm hundreds of kinds of <unk> , and they <unk> a <unk> , and you <unk> who is <unk> , and you who 's <unk> you .
I could have better to do better .
And with hundreds of <unk> , there are not <unk> for <unk> .
So when people do , they do , even if the result is <unk> , they <unk> and <unk> their same .
In the last years , the <unk> <unk> in the world .
I think a <unk> <unk> -- not only , but important -- but important -- but it 's just that people have <unk> <unk> because the <unk> are too <unk> .
And when they have to <unk> this thing that they think they 're going to be <unk> .
So the end of the end is that we 're better , but we 're going to be better .
I 'm going to show you .
This is the <unk> <unk> , what we all take for good and it 's completely <unk> .
There 's no <unk> that a little bit better than choice , but by that we don 't have that much much more choice .
There 's a <unk> , <unk> . I don 't know what it is .
But I 'm sure we 've got to a piece of the level of the <unk> to our life .
Now , from the point of <unk> -- I 've been <unk> -- from the <unk> of the <unk> , <unk> is the <unk> .
What you can <unk> this choice in society is <unk> .
There are many places in the world , and you know , <unk> <unk> <unk> , which the problem is not that they have <unk> .
The problem is that they have too <unk> .
So , I 'm talking about a <unk> <unk> of <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And that 's <unk> and <unk> is this : <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> you talked about how those <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> for <unk> <unk> . It 's a <unk> of money .
I mean that these choices , <unk> and <unk> , it 's not that they 're just <unk> .
I 'm <unk> .
They do it better .
If a little bit of what in our society <unk> <unk> to <unk> choice , where people have too much much , not only a lot of their life , not only their life , but also our life .
This is what <unk> <unk> call a <unk> <unk> .
A <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> -- because of the <unk> of this choice in <unk> that we <unk> us .
So , you can become everything you want to be that you want to -- "
<unk> , people of culture , <unk> , " But what <unk> <unk> <unk> that fish ? "
" It 's <unk> that you can 't make anything in a <unk> of <unk> . "
" A <unk> <unk> , a <unk> <unk> of the world -- "
and I <unk> the <unk> so I 've got to the beginning .
But then , <unk> , instead , I realized that fish knows that fish knows that fish knows the long long .
Because the fact of the fact that if you <unk> in <unk> <unk> , you can 't <unk> the <unk> . " You can 't <unk> the <unk> .
If you <unk> the <unk> in way that all <unk> possible possible possible to <unk> the <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , and <unk> the <unk> of <unk> .
All of <unk> .
This is almost too <unk> , maybe for the fish , and even for the fish , and we 're going to us .
But the <unk> of some <unk> <unk> is a <unk> for <unk> and , for the <unk> .
Thank you .
