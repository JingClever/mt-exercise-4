<unk> year I showed these <unk> to <unk> that the <unk> <unk> <unk> , which for almost three million years had the size of the United States , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And this <unk> <unk> the <unk> of the problem because it doesn 't show the ice <unk> .
<unk> <unk> is , in a certain sense , the heart of the climate system .
It <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> in the summer .
The next <unk> is going to be a <unk> <unk> on the <unk> of the last 25 years .
<unk> <unk> are <unk> in red .
You can see , you <unk> it down to the blue <unk> .
That 's the ice in <unk> , which is <unk> in summer .
You can see that the <unk> ice , of five years or more , is like the blood , which here <unk> from the body .
In 25 years , it 's been <unk> like that .
This is a problem because the <unk> <unk> the <unk> around the ocean <unk> , and there are enormous <unk> of <unk> that , <unk> , <unk> are <unk> <unk> .
<unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> , which <unk> could <unk> , <unk> this point of not <unk> .
In some <unk> <unk> in <unk> , the <unk> is already <unk> by the water .
The <unk> <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> ! <unk> : She 's good . The question is if you 're <unk> .
That 's why this <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> from the north .
This is a river in <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> had never <unk> <unk> <unk> .
This is the <unk> river , in the <unk> <unk> .
If you want to know how it goes up the sea level to the <unk> of the <unk> on <unk> , here is where the sea .
These <unk> are <unk> <unk> .
On the other part of the planet : <unk> , the biggest <unk> of ice on the planet .
And last month , scientists have <unk> that the <unk> of the ice is in <unk> , and that the <unk> <unk> , which <unk> on some <unk> <unk> , is particularly <unk> in the <unk> .
<unk> <unk> feet of the <unk> , like <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , the third largest <unk> of ice , you see new <unk> , which a few years ago were <unk> .
<unk> percent of the world 's population <unk> water from that <unk> .
<unk> <unk> : This <unk> is the source of water <unk> of this city .
<unk> is <unk> .
But when you <unk> , the same thing is , it 's going to <unk> water .
<unk> <unk> <unk> is <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> is <unk> of 40 percent .
<unk> <unk> are in the crisis .
<unk> , as you read , they 're <unk> .
<unk> <unk> in the world <unk> <unk> to a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> are <unk> to a <unk> out of the normal and <unk> .
<unk> times more <unk> in the last 30 years than the <unk> <unk> .
This is a <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
If you look at it in the context of them , you can see the <unk> .
In the last five years we 've been <unk> 70 million <unk> of CO2 every day .
Look at the <unk> <unk> <unk> , from the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and both of the <unk> <unk> , where there 's a <unk> <unk> of oxygen in the ocean .
The <unk> cause of global warming , together to the <unk> , which is 20 percent , is the use of <unk> <unk> .
The oil is a problem , and <unk> is even worse .
The United States is one of the two countries with the <unk> emissions , together to China .
And they 're <unk> to build a lot of other <unk> <unk> .
But we 're <unk> to a <unk> <unk> .
These are the <unk> projects over the last few years and some <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
<unk> , there 's a <unk> politics in our country .
<unk> <unk> and <unk> have <unk> <unk> million dollars in the last year to <unk> <unk> <unk> , which is a <unk> .
I 'm going to <unk> something --
<unk> <unk> , in <unk> , where I live , there was a <unk> <unk> billion <unk> <unk> .
You may have seen it on the <unk> .
This is the second bigger flow of <unk> in America .
It 's happened around <unk> .
<unk> <unk> of one of the <unk> <unk> was this .
<unk> : <unk> â™« <unk> <unk> is a <unk> and happy .
It 's <unk> here in America , and it makes our economy .
<unk> the <unk> is more <unk> .
It 's <unk> , <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> here is a lot of <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The biggest <unk> society on the <unk> is <unk> <unk> . This is his <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> <unk> : <unk> <unk> -- Al <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> -- they don 't know what they 're talking about .
<unk> : So the <unk> <unk> <unk> has two <unk> .
This is one of them , one part .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> : <unk> <unk> , we see the changes as a <unk> <unk> to our business .
So , our <unk> is <unk> a big amount of money in a <unk> <unk> to make public and <unk> the truth on <unk> .
In fact , <unk> is not <unk> .
We think it 's <unk> -- it 's also a good <unk> .
So I don 't think about climate change .
We 're going to do it .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> -- <unk> -- you know , you 've heard a lot .
So I 'm going to <unk> a <unk> structure as it 's <unk> .
<unk> ! <unk> are a little <unk> , but this is the sound of the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> is between the major <unk> of global warming , but the <unk> technology of <unk> <unk> that you see everything .
Let 's look at a : this is the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to the economic issue and the national security .
<unk> : <unk> is in the crisis ; the economy , the national security , the crisis .
The <unk> that <unk> all : our <unk> <unk> from the <unk> <unk> , like <unk> and oil <unk> .
But now , there 's a new , <unk> solution to <unk> .
<unk> America : 100 percent of energy <unk> , in 10 years .
A <unk> <unk> America to work , more <unk> , <unk> , and help to <unk> global warming .
<unk> , a solution that we 're going to solve our problems .
<unk> America . <unk> more .
<unk> : This is the last .
<unk> : <unk> : It 's about <unk> energy to America .
One of the most <unk> ways to <unk> from the <unk> that we 're going to <unk> our planet .
<unk> : The future is here . <unk> , <unk> , a new <unk> network .
<unk> <unk> two : <unk> <unk> for jobs .
<unk> : <unk> America . It 's time to be <unk> .
<unk> : A old <unk> <unk> says , " If you want to go to <unk> , go out to alone .
If you want to go far , you go together . "
We have to go far , fast .
Thank you very much .
<unk> year at TED I did a <unk> on <unk> .
And I 'm going to try to <unk> how the car works .
So , here . And for those that the other time they didn 't , the <unk> is the largest scientific <unk> experiment ever <unk> -- <unk> miles .
His task is to <unk> the conditions that were in the <unk> of the universe -- until <unk> million times <unk> per second .
All that 's just <unk> .
This is the car under <unk> .
And they 're going to <unk> these <unk> <unk> in the <unk> .
This is what I work . It 's called <unk> -- <unk> <unk> feet and it has a <unk> <unk> .
This is a <unk> picture of <unk> in building so you can see the <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> last year we <unk> the car <unk> .
And this picture was <unk> by <unk> .
It was <unk> <unk> in the <unk> room .
It 's an image of the first <unk> of particles that had done all the <unk> , <unk> in <unk> , <unk> , with a part of the <unk> , and we <unk> particles inside the <unk> .
In other words , when I <unk> that image the 10 <unk> , I <unk> that the car <unk> , which is a big <unk> .
I don 't know if it was this to <unk> us to do <unk> <unk> or that , when someone <unk> on Google and I <unk> that the page was this .
That means we 've had a <unk> impact beyond that scientific scientific one .
<unk> a week later , there was a problem with the car , had to just <unk> to these <unk> here -- these <unk> <unk> .
These <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> when the car works at the <unk> <unk> .
Now , the <unk> between you to <unk> the <unk> and <unk> , " It 's not true . I 'm too <unk> . "
And they can do that because when they 're very <unk> , they can do it because when they 're very <unk> .
So , <unk> degrees <unk> , at a temperature <unk> at the <unk> of space between stars , these <unk> can bring that <unk> .
In one of the <unk> between the most <unk> <unk> in the <unk> , there was a <unk> <unk> .
So the <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
This was the result .
Now , this is even more <unk> if you think that these <unk> <unk> more than 20 <unk> , and you 're <unk> about 30 <unk> .
They 're <unk> about 50 <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , what we did .
We have <unk> and <unk> .
They 're all going to <unk> them to their <unk> place .
<unk> the end of <unk> <unk> <unk> will be again .
We <unk> it , and we <unk> to get data <unk> or <unk> , and we continue to <unk> the <unk> , and so our <unk> to find out what the <unk> are the universe .
Now , of course , in a certain way , these <unk> <unk> the <unk> on the value of science and <unk> engineering .
I think that the fact that it 's so hard , the fact that I think that 's the value of things like <unk> .
I want to end with the words of a <unk> <unk> , which , <unk> , <unk> , which , in <unk> <unk> of the <unk> experiments of his <unk> , his <unk> was Michael <unk> , he said , " No much <unk> for progress of the human mind as the ideas of the <unk> that the ideas of science are <unk> , that our <unk> are <unk> , that our <unk> are <unk> , and <unk> are <unk> , which our <unk> are <unk> are <unk> , and that we not <unk> are <unk> .
Thank you .
I want to start <unk> to <unk> <unk> to <unk> to <unk> <unk> .
And as I <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , actually , to think and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> is <unk> to the way we 're <unk> in the world around us .
So , from <unk> <unk> from the <unk> of our <unk> with <unk> objects , and my <unk> <unk> <unk> , and to my <unk> <unk> <unk> , I started <unk> , " And if we use a computer , instead of having the <unk> <unk> as a digital <unk> that 's <unk> <unk> as a <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> with both information with both hands ,
and <unk> to our <unk> ?
The question was so interesting that I <unk> to explore the answer , building the <unk> .
In a very very very very very <unk> computer as a <unk> .
In a very very very very very <unk> computer as a <unk> .
You can <unk> them with the hand , they can <unk> them , they can hear their <unk> , and they have a <unk> <unk> .
But <unk> , they 're <unk> objects , like <unk> , you can just <unk> <unk> .
<unk> are the example of a new <unk> of tools to <unk> information .
And as they become more <unk> , <unk> of the <unk> , of the other , and as they become more <unk> , <unk> of the <unk> , of the other , of how we can explore and <unk> <unk> <unk> .
I 'm going to <unk> with some simple example .
This <unk> is <unk> to show you video : if you <unk> it in a direction , the video <unk> so , if you <unk> on the other side back .
These <unk> <unk> are <unk> of others .
If you <unk> them , you 're <unk> to what they 're around .
If they 're <unk> , and they can <unk> it a little bit .
If they 're <unk> , and they can <unk> it a little bit .
They also <unk> their movement and <unk> .
We then realized that one of the interesting <unk> of the <unk> was the <unk> to use <unk> on the data , for example , " <unk> <unk> , as if it was a <unk> .
In this case , we have three <unk> <unk> <unk> , and I can <unk> it to <unk> the color of the central one , where you 're <unk> .
and I can <unk> it to <unk> the color of the central one , where you 're <unk> .
And we 're going to <unk> it a little bit about it .
I 'm also <unk> <unk> <unk> , like <unk> , like <unk> , mathematics and <unk> , where people can try things things quickly , and I <unk> the results immediately .
Now I 'm --
This is a <unk> <unk> that I do with a <unk> program .
Here we have a <unk> of words that 's in half <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> , every <unk> <unk> a letter <unk> on every <unk> , <unk> , every <unk> , <unk> , every <unk> <unk> a letter on every <unk> , and as I <unk> <unk> , he <unk> on a <unk> .
Then , after about 30 seconds , you <unk> , and you have a new <unk> of <unk> and new <unk> <unk> to try .
Thank you .
Here 's the kids <unk> in <unk> <unk> <unk> , I did that I <unk> them and I <unk> them a video <unk> .
They 're very <unk> .
And one of the interesting things of these kinds of <unk> is that you don 't have to give people a lot of <unk> .
I just said , " <unk> <unk> , " and they know what to do .
Here 's other people who are <unk> .
This is our <unk> <unk> <unk> , there 's our <unk> <unk> , there .
It really wanted to <unk> .
They were just <unk> , for him .
Now , this is a <unk> of a <unk> <unk> .
We wanted to build a <unk> <unk> <unk> . He 's <unk> .
It can <unk> new characters in the scene , <unk> their <unk> .
It can <unk> new characters in the scene , <unk> their <unk> .
That 's , it 's doing the sun .
<unk> : The sun is <unk> .
David <unk> : Now he 's taken a <unk> in the scene .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> .
<unk> work ! Yeah !
So , <unk> <unk> and <unk> can <unk> the characters --
<unk> : <unk> !
I 'll <unk> their story .
<unk> : <unk> !
<unk> : It 's a story with the open , and it can decide how you 're <unk> .
<unk> : It 's a story with the open , and it can decide how you 're <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> away , <unk> .
<unk> : The last example I have time to show you is a device , <unk> <unk> , <unk> and <unk> music .
It 's a <unk> , <unk> recently , to <unk> and <unk> music .
The <unk> here is <unk> <unk> as the <unk> , and the <unk> .
<unk> of these have four different <unk> , and you can pick up which you use .
You can also <unk> these <unk> in a <unk> <unk> in a <unk> <unk> .
And I just <unk> a <unk> <unk> , " and a sequence . "
These are actually you can control from the live , like <unk> and the <unk> .
I <unk> it to a particular sound , and then <unk> to <unk> .
And then there are the effects that <unk> and <unk> , which <unk> to the entire sequence .
<unk> how it works .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> : <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> , <unk> in a series , <unk> , <unk> in a series , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
Now , I 'm going to take a <unk> line .
<unk> : <unk> : <unk> <unk> <unk> --
<unk> : <unk> : And now I 'm going to <unk> the <unk> , so I can control the effect of the live live .
<unk> : <unk> : I can <unk> the entire <unk> <unk> the time on one side or another .
<unk> : <unk> : And now we 're going to <unk> the bottom to give more <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> : I can <unk> the <unk> <unk> .
So I don 't have to <unk> before , but I can <unk> , <unk> , more or more <unk> .
And now , finally , I can <unk> the whole <unk> <unk> on the left <unk> <unk> .
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is to build new <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and more <unk> to how our brain work and body .
And today , I 've had time to show you one of the results of this path , and also some <unk> that we try to bring out of the lab .
And the concept that I want to <unk> is that it 's going to <unk> this new generation of objects to <unk> the <unk> media , which <unk> information in our world in the way we want .
Thank you very much .
I don 't see the hour of the <unk> with all of you .
I 'm a <unk> .
<unk> books is my <unk> , but it 's more than that , obviously .
It 's also love and the <unk> of my life .
And I don 't look like that it can change .
But , I said that , something that was <unk> in my life and my career , who brought me to <unk> the whole relationship with this work .
The particular thing is I <unk> wrote this book , this <unk> called " <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
And the result is that everywhere I 'm <unk> now , people <unk> me as if I was <unk> .
<unk> -- <unk> , <unk> !
I 'm going to be <unk> and they say , " You don 't know that I 'm not going to be able to do better ?
You don 't know why do not <unk> to write for all life <unk> without more able to create a book that can <unk> to someone ? "
<unk> that can <unk> to someone ? "
It 's <unk> , you know .
But it could go worse , <unk> that I remember more than 20 years ago , when I was saying to people -- I was a <unk> -- I wanted to be a <unk> .
I 'm going to <unk> the same <unk> <unk> .
And people say , " Don 't you know that to be able to be successful ?
You don 't fear that the <unk> of the <unk> ?
You don 't fear to do this <unk> for all life without anything that you 've ever come out and to die on a <unk> of <unk> <unk> ? "
So , you know .
The answer -- the short answer to all these questions is , " You know . "
Yeah , I fear of all those things .
I always had fear .
And I fear of a lot of other things that people can 't <unk> .
And as the <unk> and other things <unk> .
But , as it 's about the writing what I thought and <unk> is why ?
Is it <unk> ?
It 's <unk> that anybody who <unk> <unk> to be <unk> by a job that you feel born to do .
But what is so particular in the <unk> <unk> <unk> to <unk> health <unk> <unk> in a way that other <unk> don 't do ?
As my father , for example , he was a <unk> <unk> and I didn 't remember one time in his 40 years of activity where he was asked if she was <unk> to be <unk> <unk> ?
<unk> 't it ever -- that <unk> of <unk> John , how does it ?
<unk> 't you like that , <unk> ?
<unk> , engineers <unk> like <unk> <unk> <unk> .
We <unk> , we have this <unk> , and not just <unk> , but we 're all <unk> of all , we have this <unk> to be <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And I don 't want to look at the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> that , only in the <unk> century , <unk> young and often to them .
And the ones that they don 't <unk> seem to be really <unk> by their <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , before she died , in the last <unk> said , " Every book <unk> a little more <unk> , " <unk> a little more <unk> about the work of your life .
But we don 't know when we 're saying that , why we 've heard these things so long that somehow we have completely <unk> and <unk> the <unk> that creativity and <unk> are <unk> <unk> that the creativity and the <unk> , finally , I always <unk> to <unk> .
And the question I want to talk to all over here today is , are you agree with this idea ?
It 's good for you , because it 's also <unk> by a <unk> distance to me .
I think it 's <unk> .
And I think it 's also <unk> and I don 't want to <unk> <unk> in the next century .
I think it 's better <unk> our big <unk> to live .
And I certainly know that , in my case -- it would be very <unk> to start <unk> to that <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> in which I 'm in my career .
<unk> -- <unk> look , I 'm pretty young , I 'm <unk> , I 'm <unk> , I 'm pretty young years .
I still have about four <unk> <unk> in me .
And it 's very <unk> that anything <unk> in now , it 's going to be <unk> from the world as the work that <unk> after the <unk> of my last book .
<unk> <unk> , because we 're all more or less friends here -- is <unk> that my greatest success is to my <unk> .
Oh , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> !
You know , that 's the kind of thought that it brings a person to start <unk> <unk> to the nine of the morning and I don 't want to do it .
I 'm going to continue doing this work that I love .
So , the question becomes , how ?
And so I think , after many <unk> , which the way to work to keep <unk> and writing is to create a <unk> <unk> <unk> , right ?
I have to get a few <unk> distance of <unk> between me , which I 'm <unk> , and my natural <unk> on which <unk> to what <unk> <unk> <unk> . And as I was going to get <unk> , and I was going to try to find other society to see if you <unk> , looking through time , trying to find other society to see if you 're more <unk> ideas and more <unk> <unk>
about how to help people <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of creativity .
And that research took me to the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
And I 'm going to <unk> and then <unk> back .
<unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> -- people don 't believe that creativity <unk> from men , OK ?
It <unk> that creativity was this <unk> spirit and <unk> to men from a <unk> <unk> and <unk> , for reasons and <unk> and <unk> , for reasons and <unk> .
<unk> <unk> these <unk> <unk> <unk> of creativity of <unk> <unk> .
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> to have a <unk> <unk> <unk> from away .
The <unk> were the same idea , but they <unk> that kind of <unk> of the spirit without a <unk> .
And the <unk> is , because the <unk> didn 't really think that a <unk> was really smart .
And I thought a <unk> was this kind of <unk> <unk> that <unk> literally <unk> in the <unk> of a <unk> artist , a little <unk> like the <unk> <unk> , and that <unk> out of <unk> <unk> , and <unk> out of <unk> <unk> the work of the artist 's <unk> and <unk> the result of that work .
<unk> <unk> , that 's the distance of which I talk -- that <unk> <unk> that <unk> you from the results of your work .
And everybody <unk> that was so that you 're going to be , right ?
So the artists were <unk> by <unk> things , like the <unk> too <unk> , right ?
If your work was <unk> not to <unk> the <unk> , everybody <unk> that <unk> state <unk> <unk> <unk> by this <unk> <unk> .
If your work <unk> , it wasn 't all your <unk> , right ?
Everybody <unk> that was your <unk> to be a <unk> .
And so people <unk> <unk> creativity in <unk> for a long time .
Then the <unk> <unk> and all <unk> , and we <unk> this big idea ; we put the human in the middle of the universe on all the <unk> and the <unk> and <unk> without more to <unk> space that <unk> <unk> from the <unk> .
This was the principle of <unk> <unk> and people who were <unk> to think that creativity <unk> completely from the <unk> .
And for the first time in history , <unk> to <unk> to this , or that artist as a <unk> <unk> that to a <unk> person with <unk> .
And I have to <unk> , I think it was a big <unk> .
I think that I 'm going to <unk> to someone , a simple person to believe that I 'm like a <unk> , <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> is a <unk> <unk> <unk> to human <unk> .
It 's like <unk> to someone to <unk> the sun .
<unk> and <unk> the completely <unk> and <unk> all these <unk> <unk> on the <unk> .
And I think it was this pressure to have <unk> artists in the <unk> 500 years .
And , if this is true , and I think that 's the question , is it , and now ?
Can we do that <unk> ?
<unk> to a more <unk> understanding of the relationship between humans and <unk> <unk> .
Or maybe not .
Maybe we can 't <unk> 500 years of thinking in a <unk> <unk> in a talk of 18 minutes .
And there 's probably people in the audience who are <unk> <unk> <unk> on the <unk> , <unk> , you do that <unk> people <unk> <unk> to <unk> on their projects .
You probably don 't want to tell you all about this thing .
But the question I would like to <unk> is -- why ?
Why don 't we <unk> this way ?
Because it 's more sense of anything else I 've ever heard to explain the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> process .
A process that , as anybody who ever <unk> to do something -- so , basically , all of this -- you don 't know , you don 't <unk> <unk> .
And in fact , it can sometimes completely <unk> .
I did this <unk> <unk> with the extraordinary <unk> <unk> , who has now 90 years , but that was a <unk> for all the life and said that during his <unk> <unk> , <unk> out in the <unk> <unk> , <unk> out in the <unk> <unk> , <unk> out in the <unk> <unk> .
He said she was like a <unk> <unk> of the air .
And that <unk> <unk> to her from the <unk> .
And he <unk> it to get , because he was <unk> the land under his feet .
I was going to have one thing to do that point and was , his <unk> , his <unk> as a <unk> .
And I was <unk> to home and was <unk> by this <unk> , and it wouldn 't have to get another one of paper and a little bit <unk> , and I was <unk> <unk> and <unk> on the page .
<unk> times I couldn 't be enough , so <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> through and she would <unk> <unk> through and she would <unk> <unk> through the <unk> , looking for , as she said , " another <unk> . "
Then there were those times -- this piece never <unk> -- there were moments when the <unk> was almost <unk> , right ?
So , he was <unk> home and he was looking for paper and the <unk> <unk> through , and he was a <unk> <unk> in the while he was <unk> , and he said , that was like if you <unk> with the other hand and the <unk> .
<unk> the <unk> from the tail and the <unk> in his body and the <unk> on the page .
And in these cases , the <unk> would be <unk> on the <unk> , and <unk> , but the <unk> , the <unk> <unk> to the first word .
So when you <unk> it -- it 's <unk> , it 's exactly <unk> to my <unk> process .
Not all my <unk> process -- I 'm not a <unk> !
I 'm a <unk> , and my way to <unk> is ; I 'm going to <unk> every day and work and <unk> on the <unk> .
But even me , in my <unk> , I <unk> against that thing , sometimes .
And I 'm going to <unk> that many of you <unk> it .
You know , even though the work and the ideas will be <unk> me from a certain source I couldn 't <unk> .
And what is this thing ?
And how can we <unk> it in a way we don 't have to <unk> your head , but rather , what would we do ?
And as I 'm going to say , the best example I have been the <unk> <unk> <unk> , which I 've been <unk> years ago for a <unk> .
And I 'm talking about this , and you know , for the <unk> of life was the <unk> of the <unk> artist <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> these <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
But then <unk> , he was <unk> , and a day while he was <unk> on a <unk> <unk> , <unk> all over him .
<unk> <unk> and all of a <unk> <unk> , and all of a <unk> <unk> , which is in his head as a <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , and <unk> , and the <unk> , you know , it 's wonderful , and the <unk> , but not as <unk> .
It 's not a piece of paper , it doesn 't have a <unk> , it doesn 't have a <unk> .
So , it starts to hear this kind of old <unk> <unk> to him , and I 'm going to lose , and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> from this song <unk> .
I 'm not enough <unk> and I can 't <unk> . "
And instead of going to <unk> , they <unk> .
<unk> the whole process and made something completely new .
I just <unk> the sky and said , " <unk> , you know I 'm going to <unk> ? "
" Do you think it 's going to write a song now ?
If you really want to <unk> , you 're going to be <unk> , when I can care about you .
<unk> , <unk> to <unk> another today .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . "
And his <unk> process after this .
Not the work , the work was still <unk> as always .
But the process , and the <unk> <unk> that was <unk> when he <unk> the <unk> , the <unk> that outside he was <unk> , the <unk> that outside , and <unk> <unk> back from where , <unk> that was not going to be a <unk> and <unk> .
but I <unk> this <unk> , wonderful <unk> <unk> a conversation between <unk> and this <unk> thing and <unk> and <unk> , but it wasn 't <unk> .
So , how much <unk> that story is to change a little bit of the way I <unk> and already <unk> me a time .
This idea , I was <unk> when I was <unk> , " <unk> , " and I <unk> , " and I <unk> in one of the <unk> <unk> , where we 're all working on something , and we can 't think that it 's going to be the <unk> , that 's going to be the <unk> , that what the <unk> will be .
Not just <unk> , just <unk> the book .
And I started thinking about <unk> this project .
But then I 'm going to <unk> me <unk> that <unk> to the air and we <unk> .
So I <unk> my face on the <unk> and I <unk> my <unk> to a <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> <unk> in the room .
And I said to <unk> <unk> , " <unk> , what , both we know that if this book is not going to be <unk> my , right ?
Because you see I 'm going to <unk> this , I 'm not more than that .
So if you want that to be better , you have to <unk> and do your part .
OK . But if you don 't do that , you know what , I don 't want to do .
I started writing the same because it 's my work .
And I would like to <unk> that I 'm <unk> to do my part . " Because -- finally , it 's so , OK -- it 's in the <unk> of Africa of the <unk> <unk> people <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , music that will <unk> on the <unk> <unk> , music that will be <unk> on for hours to <unk> .
And they were always <unk> , because the <unk> were <unk> and they were <unk> .
But every once , <unk> , something <unk> , and one of these artists <unk> actually <unk> <unk> .
And I know you know what I 'm talking , because I know you 've all seen it , at a certain point , a <unk> like that .
It was like the time , and the <unk> <unk> through a kind of <unk> and <unk> <unk> through a kind of <unk> and it wasn 't doing anything else from the usually , but it <unk> .
And suddenly not just <unk> as a human <unk> .
But they <unk> out of the <unk> and <unk> in the fire of the <unk> .
And when this <unk> , at the time , people <unk> what was , I <unk> with her name .
<unk> your hands and <unk> to <unk> , " <unk> , <unk> , God , " God , " God . "
That 's God , you know .
<unk> <unk> -- when the <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> , I <unk> this <unk> with them and the <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , " which you can still hear in the <unk> or in the <unk> .
In <unk> , when an artist has done something impossible and <unk> , " <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> -- a <unk> of God .
And it 's <unk> because we need .
But , the problem comes the day after , to the <unk> same , when you <unk> and <unk> that are 11 11 <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> . I <unk> 't have more .
It 's just a great <unk> to <unk> <unk> , and maybe never <unk> to that <unk> to <unk> .
And maybe nobody <unk> the name of God , while I 'm going to do with the rest of his life ?
It 's hard .
This is one of the most <unk> <unk> to do in a <unk> life .
But maybe it doesn 't have to be so <unk> if you don 't believe , <unk> , <unk> , that the most <unk> of your being being being being being being being being being being being <unk> .
But let me just just show you that data in <unk> from a source of this <unk> part of your life that you have to go to <unk> when you 're finished .
And , you know , if we think that all of it , it 's all the way .
And so I started <unk> , and it 's certainly like I 've been <unk> for several months during the <unk> of the book that I would soon , the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> of my success .
And what I have to continue <unk> when I feel <unk> from this is , I don 't fear .
You don 't <unk> . You just get your work .
<unk> to <unk> your <unk> , whatever it can be .
If your work is <unk> , <unk> .
If the <unk> , you 're going to <unk> <unk> <unk> to you <unk> <unk> some kind of <unk> , for one moment through your <unk> , then , " <unk> ! "
<unk> , you do the same <unk> .
And " <unk> ! " <unk> <unk> you the same .
I think it 's going to be <unk> <unk> .
" <unk> ! " <unk> <unk> to you the same , even for having <unk> love and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Thank you .
Thank you .
<unk> <unk> : <unk> !
You know , I 've already talked about some of these projects on human genome , what it can <unk> and the discovery of genes .
We 're now now going to <unk> a new way : we started <unk> biology and now start from that digital code , we 're <unk> in a new <unk> of biology , <unk> and <unk> life .
We always tried to ask <unk> big questions .
" <unk> is life ? " It 's something that many <unk> I think they have <unk> to understand at various levels .
We tried different <unk> , <unk> to the <unk> terms .
We 're <unk> for almost 20 years .
When we <unk> the human genome <unk> to go from the <unk> world of biology in the digital world .
Now we 're going to <unk> us : Can we <unk> life , or create new life from this digital universe ?
This is a map of a little <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , which is the species from the <unk> genome in the <unk> genome between what they can <unk> in the lab .
And we tried to <unk> the genome to <unk> a little bit more small .
We 're able to <unk> a <unk> of the genes about 500 that are here .
But when we take a look at his map , it 's just <unk> simple than our .
<unk> , this is simple .
But when we look at all the genes that we can <unk> , one at the time , is very <unk> that this can bring a <unk> cell .
So I thought the only way to <unk> was <unk> this <unk> <unk> <unk> to <unk> some of these questions .
And so we started the <unk> of " <unk> , can we <unk> a <unk> ? "
Can the <unk> chemistry to produce these big molecules that we 've never been able to create before ?
And , in case , can we make a <unk> ?
A <unk> is just a piece of <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The speed we 're able to <unk> life is <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Our ability to write the code , instead , <unk> <unk> , but it 's <unk> .
And our most <unk> results <unk> <unk> to a <unk> <unk> .
We 've <unk> over 15 years ago .
The process has <unk> a lot of <unk> , <unk> with a <unk> <unk> before we <unk> the <unk> experiments .
But we found that DNA <unk> is very difficult .
There are <unk> of thousands of cars in the world that we <unk> small <unk> , <unk> of 30 to 50 <unk> and it 's a <unk> process : the <unk> is long , the <unk> is the long , the <unk> is , more <unk> there are .
So we had to develop a new <unk> to <unk> these <unk> and <unk> the <unk> .
And this was our first <unk> , <unk> from digital information of the <unk> genome <unk> <unk> .
It 's a little virus that we <unk> bacteria .
We designed the <unk> , <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> and <unk> a DNA <unk> <unk> .
The interesting part is when we took this piece of <unk> material , and we <unk> it in bacteria , the bacteria have <unk> to read this code and <unk> the <unk> particles .
<unk> particles are <unk> by the cells , are <unk> back and they <unk> the <unk> <unk> .
I 've been talking about recently recently with members of the <unk> industry that they have certainly <unk> this model .
They have more <unk> than you .
And I think that 's a situation where the software can actually build his same <unk> in a <unk> system .
But let 's do the biggest things in the big .
We wanted to build the entire <unk> of the <unk> .
I 'm more than <unk> <unk> code .
So we thought we 're going to <unk> in the size of the virus , so that we can change the <unk> to understand what the <unk> are the <unk> of a <unk> cell .
<unk> is <unk> , and if you 're <unk> with information <unk> in a computer , they must be very <unk> .
When I <unk> this genome for the first time in <unk> <unk> , the standard <unk> was a <unk> for every 10 <unk> .
We found , <unk> , 30 <unk> . If we used that original <unk> <unk> never been able to do that work .
A process of the process is to design <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> with all other <unk> <unk> 50 <unk> to build smaller <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> elements here .
You probably read that you read that <unk> us in the <unk> .
So , we have a <unk> code <unk> on four <unk> : A , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> and <unk> <unk>
<unk> of those <unk> <unk> together , <unk> <unk> , and there 's a <unk> order to <unk> each <unk> .
So we can use the code to write words , <unk> , <unk> .
What we did at the beginning was <unk> .
Some have been <unk> by the fact that it wasn 't <unk> .
We designed these <unk> to <unk> simply <unk> <unk> with <unk> .
There are <unk> that <unk> them and <unk> them <unk> .
And we started <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> every step we produced these <unk> in <unk> so that we 're <unk> to create a very <unk> <unk> <unk> , which we 're going to be a very <unk> <unk> , as you 're going to see in a minute .
We 're trying to <unk> the process .
So , this seems the <unk> of a <unk> <unk> .
When I <unk> to these <unk> much more than 100 <unk> <unk> , you don 't get to the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
You get to the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> biology .
So we 've <unk> other <unk> .
<unk> of another <unk> called <unk> <unk> , which in biology <unk> to <unk> DNA <unk> , <unk> the DNA that can <unk> <unk> .
Here 's one example .
This <unk> , called <unk> <unk> , can <unk> three million <unk> <unk> .
You can see in the <unk> <unk> as his <unk> is <unk> .
<unk> 12 hours is <unk> exactly like it was before .
<unk> thousands of organisms that are able to do that .
These organisms can be completely <unk> .
They 're going to live under <unk> .
I 'm absolutely sure life <unk> in space , and they 're going to be <unk> <unk> of water <unk> .
And actually , NASA 's shown that this is happening .
This is a picture of the <unk> that we built using these <unk> , just using these <unk> , just using the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> them <unk> .
This image was not <unk> with a <unk> <unk> , but with a <unk> <unk> .
It 's a <unk> so big that we can <unk> with a <unk> <unk> .
These are pictures that <unk> a period of about six seconds .
This is the <unk> we 've done a little bit of time .
I 'm more than <unk> <unk> code .
It 's the biggest <unk> of a <unk> <unk> <unk> ever <unk> by man .
It has a <unk> <unk> <unk> to 300 million .
If you <unk> it with a 10 <unk> without spaces , we 're going to be <unk> pages to <unk> this code .
Now , how do we make it work ? How can we <unk> ?
Of course , through a virus is a <unk> .
It 's a little more <unk> when you use of the bacteria .
It 's <unk> even when it 's <unk> cells , like our : you just <unk> the <unk> and <unk> another , which is basically the process of <unk> .
In <unk> <unk> , the <unk> is instead <unk> into the cell , but we have <unk> <unk> that we 're able to do a <unk> <unk> of a cell <unk> to another cell <unk> and <unk> .
We <unk> a <unk> <unk> from a kind of <unk> .
The two different <unk> than the men from the <unk> .
We 've <unk> some <unk> in more <unk> <unk> that we could decide what this <unk> to <unk> .
And then he <unk> with the <unk> <unk> <unk> all the <unk> .
And when we put it in the cell was <unk> and <unk> our <unk> <unk> the new <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And we 're not going to go beyond , but we tried to <unk> more <unk> in there .
This is one of the major <unk> of evolution .
We found that <unk> species have <unk> a second or a third <unk> <unk> somewhere , <unk> in a second thousands of new <unk> to that species .
So who think of evolution as a only <unk> to the time you <unk> <unk> has not the big part of biology .
We 're going to be <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> that was in the cell <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> that we <unk> <unk> .
It 's <unk> , and he <unk> the other <unk> as a <unk> material , and we 're <unk> with only the cell and the new <unk> .
It 's become blue because of the genes we 've <unk> .
And in a short <unk> of time , all the <unk> of a species are <unk> , and you <unk> around the new software species , <unk> on the new software , which we 've <unk> in the cell .
All the <unk> are <unk> , and the <unk> are <unk> , and when you <unk> the code <unk> code <unk> exactly what we 've <unk> you .
Now , this could be <unk> <unk> , but we can <unk> the software things in a <unk> <unk> .
Now , I 've already <unk> that here 's not about <unk> -- but <unk> progress from three million years and a half of evolution and a half of evolution , and I said that maybe we 're going to create a new version of the <unk> <unk> that we 're <unk> new species on this <unk> process .
Why do that ?
I think it 's pretty <unk> when we think about our <unk> .
We 're going to go from six and a half billion people in the next 40 years .
Just to give one example : I was born in <unk> .
Now , there are three people on the planet to <unk> <unk> in <unk> ; there 's three people will be four .
We 're <unk> problems now now to find food , <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> for six billion people .
We 're still going to do it for nine billion .
<unk> more than five billion <unk> , more than 30 billion <unk> <unk> .
That means percent million <unk> a day .
When we try to find <unk> <unk> , or any kind of <unk> <unk> , it will be a huge challenge .
In more we have to realize all the <unk> of CO2 from these materials that <unk> in the atmosphere .
At day , thank you to the <unk> <unk> around the world , we have a <unk> with about 20 million genes , and I love to think that are the <unk> for the future .
The <unk> industry is just a <unk> about <unk> , and think about how many different things are <unk> out .
Our <unk> here are data <unk> from the <unk> reality and our imagination .
We have now <unk> , thank you to these <unk> <unk> <unk> , able to create what we call <unk> <unk> <unk> .
We 're able to build a big robot that can produce a million <unk> a day .
Think about <unk> these 20 million genes or <unk> to <unk> the <unk> to produce <unk> or <unk> , new <unk> , we can change , because of a small team , and create more <unk> biology now that in the last 20 years of science .
And it 's just a standard <unk> .
We can choose to <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
This is a <unk> of some software <unk> that we 're working on to be able to <unk> and design species to computers .
Well , we don 't know how they 're going to be .
We know exactly how their <unk> code .
We 're now <unk> on the <unk> <unk> generation .
You also saw that <unk> <unk> from the <unk> was a <unk> .
We have <unk> <unk> and third generation that we 're going to be <unk> enough to <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> or different kinds of <unk> .
But the only way the biology can have a big impact without <unk> <unk> the cost of food and <unk> <unk> the <unk> would be <unk> CO2 in matter , so we 're working for cells that can reach this , and we 're working for cells that can reach this , and we think we 're the first <unk> of <unk> generation in about 18 months .
<unk> light <unk> with CO2 is a <unk> , but in our <unk> <unk> around the world , we found different <unk> .
This is a <unk> that we 've <unk> in the <unk> .
<unk> in the ocean , <unk> <unk> feet down to the temperature of <unk> water .
<unk> <unk> by CO2 using hydrogen <unk> as hydrogen <unk> as source .
We 're trying to understand whether we can <unk> CO2 , which can easily be <unk> by <unk> , <unk> that CO2 in <unk> , to drive this process .
So , we think we can be able to <unk> what the basic question of , " which is the basic question that what is life is , we <unk> , we have the <unk> goal of <unk> the whole industry .
<unk> . If you can 't do that from TED , where can you ?
It 's a main source of energy .
<unk> , we 're working for using the same <unk> to create <unk> <unk> .
You saw this year with the flu , we 're always back a year and with a dollar in less when it 's about find the right .
I think what you can change building <unk> <unk> in <unk> .
That 's how the future could start to look <unk> , now , the tree of evolution , <unk> <unk> with bacteria , <unk> , <unk> cells , and finally <unk> cells .
We 're in so much about the <unk> people .
Our goal is to do in a way to <unk> to try to <unk> it . Thank you very much .
<unk> of all I 'm going to show you , the most <unk> possible , some <unk> work , the new technology that we took to <unk> <unk> almost a year ago . This is <unk> .
It 's a environment that you can <unk> is <unk> to the local level that you can <unk> with a huge amount of data .
Here we 're seeing <unk> <unk> <unk> with a kind of <unk> <unk> and <unk> , for a fast <unk> , <unk> , <unk> the images as we want .
And it doesn 't matter how big the amount of information that we see , how big these <unk> are these <unk> of data or images .
Most of them are common photographs , but this is a <unk> <unk> by the <unk> of the <unk> , and <unk> in the <unk> <unk> .
It doesn 't make any difference because the only thing that <unk> the <unk> of a system like this is the number of <unk> on your screen in any moment . It 's also a very <unk> architecture .
This is a whole book , example of data not <unk> .
This is <unk> <unk> <unk> . Every <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And to <unk> that it 's just about the text and not <unk> , we can do something like that , to actually see that it 's a real <unk> of the text , not a picture .
It could be a little bit <unk> to read a <unk> book .
I don 't <unk> you .
This is an <unk> example . It 's a <unk> number of <unk> .
Every big image is the beginning of a <unk> .
And it really gives you the pleasure and the beautiful experience of read the real version of a <unk> or a <unk> , which is for nature a <unk> of a half .
We also did something with the corner of this particular number in particular <unk> .
We 've created a <unk> <unk> <unk> much more than what you use in a normal <unk> , and we 've <unk> you <unk> <unk> , and we 've <unk> you <unk> <unk> .
If you want to see the <unk> of this <unk> , you can see here .
Or other models , or even <unk> <unk> .
And this really <unk> some of these ideas to <unk> the <unk> of space on the screen .
And I think this is going to be able to <unk> and other <unk> <unk> , not <unk> to be <unk> .
Of course , the <unk> is one of the most <unk> <unk> for this kind of technology .
And on this not want to lose time , if we don 't say we have <unk> <unk> to give you a <unk> in this field .
These are all the streets in the United States <unk> over a NASA picture .
So now I 'm going to <unk> something else .
This is now actually live in the Web ; you can see it .
This is a project called <unk> , which <unk> two different technologies .
One is <unk> and the other is a <unk> <unk> to the very interesting computer made by <unk> <unk> , a student of Washington , with the help of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And it 's live on the Web , <unk> <unk> .
You can <unk> when we do this kind of <unk> , where we can go from an image to the other and have this kind of experience <unk> <unk> .
But the <unk> <unk> of the images here actually has a meaning .
<unk> <unk> <unk> , and these things are all <unk> together , so that you 're <unk> to the places that <unk> all <unk> <unk> on the <unk> <unk> <unk> on the <unk> <unk> <unk> are <unk> . Here you see some <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , and these things are all <unk> at the <unk> level .
I don 't know if I 've got time to show you some other environment .
There are much more <unk> .
I want to go to one of the <unk> of <unk> data and this <unk> from a <unk> <unk> <unk> that we 've done for the first time , I 'm going to be the <unk> <unk> . And this technology is really the key behind this technology , the <unk> . And that 's not so much <unk> by looking for the <unk> that we 've done in the website .
We had to <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
This is a <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> and <unk> images of kinds of <unk> , <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> . And he 's <unk> of these <unk> <unk> <unk> . This is an image that 's <unk> <unk> .
So they 're all <unk> images from <unk> and they 're all <unk> <unk> on this way .
And it 's possible to <unk> this <unk> way .
You know , I would never have thought of it .
It 's very <unk> <unk> <unk> this kind of <unk> here .
I think I think I 'm going to see that it 's a lot of different types of <unk> : <unk> <unk> <unk> , a <unk> number , <unk> together in this environment .
And if I can , I can <unk> <unk> to <unk> those <unk> .
Many are <unk> by <unk> , etc .
<unk> here is a series of photographs -- <unk> .
This is a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
We can go from the <unk> to the physics of this environment .
The <unk> point is that we can do things with social environment . This is now <unk> data from <unk> by <unk> <unk> from the whole memory of how to <unk> the Earth , from the <unk> <unk> and <unk> all that data together .
All of the pictures become <unk> together , and the <unk> of the <unk> .
You have a model of the entire land that <unk> .
Think about this as the <unk> of the work of <unk> <unk> on Earth <unk> .
It 's something that <unk> in complexity <unk> as people <unk> , and the <unk> that you 're going to be <unk> with the use .
They 're <unk> with <unk> <unk> by other people .
If someone is the idea of <unk> all these <unk> <unk> the name , my picture of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> of anybody else , and I can use a social <unk> and <unk> .
Of course , a <unk> of all this is <unk> <unk> models of every interesting part of the Earth , <unk> not just <unk> by <unk> <unk> and <unk> and <unk> , but from the <unk> memory .
Thank you very much .
CA : I 'm good ? What your software will we <unk> to do is that at some point , in the next few years , all the photographs <unk> from anybody in the world are <unk> <unk> together ?
<unk> : Yeah . What 's doing in fact , it 's doing is basically <unk> .
It 's creating <unk> , if you want , between pictures .
And he 's doing the <unk> of the content .
The thing becomes very interesting if you think about the <unk> of information <unk> that many of these pictures .
As you do a <unk> of images on the Web , you <unk> a <unk> and the text on the Web has a lot of information about images .
Now , what if that picture is going on to all your picture ?
So , the amount of <unk> and the amount of <unk> that 's really huge . It 's a <unk> effect . It 's a <unk> effect of the net .
CA : <unk> , it 's really incredible .
<unk> : I 'm going to tell you very much .
One of the major <unk> when you <unk> and one of the <unk> <unk> is the <unk> of living in the wind , <unk> the past the wind <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
I think that <unk> <unk> <unk> still beyond the <unk> <unk> , or that the <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> are still <unk> <unk> , or <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , to <unk> the <unk> <unk> , to <unk> the <unk> of <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> of <unk> , and that the idea that the world we live in which is not in which , but it 's just a <unk> of reality , but it 's just a model ,
the <unk> of a particular <unk> of choices that our <unk> has done , well , a lot of <unk> .
And , of course , all <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Everybody <unk> . Everybody <unk> .
We 're <unk> <unk> <unk> .
We need to <unk> the death <unk> , so we don 't <unk> it if you <unk> and <unk> --
We all have an art .
What <unk> is the particular <unk> of the song , the <unk> of every culture .
It doesn 't matter that the <unk> of the <unk> , or the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , or the <unk> <unk> <unk> , or the <unk> <unk> <unk> , the <unk> of <unk> , or a <unk> in the heart of the <unk> .
He was my <unk> of a journey in the <unk> a month ago , or a <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> , on the <unk> , <unk> 's mother of the world .
All of these <unk> are <unk> that there are other ways of <unk> other ways of thinking , other ways of moving in the world .
And if you 're going to take a moment , it 's a concept that can give you hope .
<unk> , the <unk> of the world create a <unk> of <unk> life and <unk> that <unk> the planet and it 's important for the <unk> of the planet , as the <unk> <unk> <unk> as <unk> <unk> .
And you can think of this <unk> <unk> as a <unk> and you can <unk> the <unk> <unk> of all the <unk> , dreams , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> to be by the human imagination of <unk> .
<unk> is the fantastic <unk> of humanity .
It 's the <unk> of what we are and what we can be in as <unk> species .
And <unk> the <unk> was <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> was successful to the <unk> and much more <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , for example , <unk> that 50 percent of all the species was or on the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> simply because it 's <unk> , or -- in the <unk> <unk> -- in the <unk> of diversity -- and you don 't even even even even <unk> -- that <unk> diversity .
The <unk> <unk> of that is , obviously , the <unk> <unk> .
When you 're <unk> <unk> <unk> on this planet .
A language is not just <unk> by a <unk> or a <unk> of <unk> .
A language is the <unk> of the human spirit .
It 's the middle that the <unk> of every culture is coming into the world .
Every language is a forest of the mind , a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And of those <unk> <unk> , as we 're sitting here in <unk> , at least half the <unk> is not more <unk> in the <unk> of the children .
They 're not going to <unk> kids , which means , unless you do something , which they 're already death .
What 's more <unk> than being <unk> by the <unk> , of being the last to talk a language , the <unk> of the <unk> or <unk> the <unk> of <unk> or to <unk> the <unk> of <unk> ?
This <unk> <unk> was the state of someone in the world every two weeks : every two weeks : every two weeks , a <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> with the <unk> <unk> of a <unk> language .
And I know that somebody of you know , " <unk> 't that ?
The world wouldn 't be a better place if we all have the same language ? " <unk> , then we 're all <unk> . <unk> .
<unk> <unk> .
<unk> of a <unk> thing that means I can 't talk about their own language .
I would like to do a journey through the <unk> --
a little journey in the <unk> to give you a <unk> of what we 're <unk> .
Many of us <unk> that when I say , " different ways of <unk> . " I mean , " I really different ways of <unk> .
<unk> for example , this <unk> <unk> <unk> , the <unk> of <unk> , which <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> from the river <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
It 's a <unk> that 's not able to <unk> the blue color from green because the green <unk> is <unk> in the time of the forest , which we <unk> the <unk> .
They have a <unk> language and a <unk> rule , <unk> , " <unk> <unk> <unk> . " You have to <unk> a person who talks about a different language .
All that <unk> in the past <unk> , though , the <unk> is that in these families in which they talk six or seven <unk> because of the <unk> <unk> <unk> no one language .
You 're going to listen and then to talk to .
And I was one of the most interesting <unk> I lived with , the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , an incredible <unk> that had the first <unk> in <unk> .
In <unk> , <unk> , they <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
They 've done <unk> by the top pictures that <unk> them in <unk> <unk> , <unk> that this <unk> <unk> of the <unk> forest had never seen anything .
They <unk> the picture from the ground , they <unk> to the <unk> of a shape or a <unk> and , they didn 't <unk> , they <unk> <unk> that <unk> , and they <unk> the five <unk> with the <unk> .
But <unk> not just <unk> the <unk> .
They 're <unk> with them .
<unk> percent of <unk> <unk> was <unk> by themselves .
We 're <unk> to eight <unk> and we found two <unk> of death and we 've been <unk> to know , they <unk> that one of them was <unk> so that he died , and then they <unk> the same . He <unk> the same . He <unk> , <unk> the same .
<unk> were able to recognize the animal <unk> from 40 <unk> and <unk> the species .
<unk> <unk> years old 80 , I was <unk> a very interesting job when my <unk> <unk> <unk> me if I wanted to go to <unk> <unk> in <unk> society <unk> to the base of the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
To give a sense of <unk> , I should have to understand the <unk> culture and that the <unk> is not <unk> <unk> .
It 's pretty a <unk> <unk> <unk> of the world .
Very interesting .
If you ask you to <unk> the big <unk> of the world , what do you ?
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , etc .
A continent is always <unk> out , thinking that Africa has no <unk> <unk> . And instead and <unk> , and the <unk> is not the <unk> of these <unk> <unk> <unk> .
What makes the <unk> is the <unk> of the <unk> between life and death .
So the <unk> do <unk> <unk> .
<unk> can be <unk> by the <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> to the <unk> of the live live in such a short moment , it becomes the <unk> .
So , for that <unk> <unk> <unk> , you go to <unk> God .
We 're going to <unk> and <unk> God . "
And from the moment that you 're <unk> , is the spirit that <unk> you , how can you make it bad ?
So , you 're <unk> to these incredible events : <unk> <unk> in the state of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And I 'm all the <unk> with which I lived with the most <unk> are the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , in the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , in the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> of the <unk> civilization that once <unk> on the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
In a continent <unk> of blood , this <unk> never been <unk> by the <unk> .
<unk> today are <unk> by a <unk> , but their education is extraordinary <unk> .
<unk> <unk> are <unk> by the families to three or four , and they live in a world <unk> and <unk> in a world <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> for 18 years .
Two <unk> years old <unk> of nine years <unk> <unk> that <unk> in the <unk> of mother , now are <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> .
And for all this time , they 're <unk> to the values of their society , values that they <unk> their <unk> and only their <unk> <unk> <unk> -- or to say the <unk> <unk> .
And then , at the <unk> <unk> , they 're <unk> out and for the first time in their life , they see an <unk> . And in that moment of <unk> , when the sun <unk> the <unk> <unk> , when the sun <unk> <unk> , all they have learned in theory , everything they have learned in theory . <unk> <unk> , everything they have learned in the <unk> . <unk> : <unk> <unk> <unk> , everything they 're going to be <unk> , all that they 're <unk> all all <unk> in the <unk> .
" <unk> ? <unk> as I said .
It 's <unk> . Now it 's <unk> . "
They call <unk> <unk> and they say that we , <unk> <unk> , we are the <unk> of the world .
This level of <unk> is very important .
When we think of the <unk> <unk> and the <unk> <unk> and the old story of the <unk> <unk> , which is a concept <unk> in its <unk> or maybe <unk> <unk> and say that these are more <unk> to the Earth than we .
<unk> <unk> are not <unk> or <unk> by the <unk> .
There 's no space for these things in the <unk> <unk> of <unk> or in the <unk> <unk> <unk> , but because of time and <unk> , they 've created a <unk> of the Earth <unk> <unk> <unk> , but on a more <unk> : the <unk> of <unk> <unk> , but on a more <unk> : the Earth 's <unk> .
What does it mean ?
And I mean that a <unk> of the <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> that the mountain is a <unk> <unk> that <unk> its <unk> will be a <unk> <unk> <unk> with the mountain or that place with the mountain or that place as a <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> a mountain of <unk> <unk> <unk> to be <unk> .
which is the <unk> of one spirit or a <unk> <unk> is <unk> .
What 's interesting is the <unk> that <unk> the relationship between the <unk> and the natural world .
I grew up in the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> to be <unk> .
That made me a human being different from my friends who believe that the <unk> are the <unk> of <unk> and the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> and the <unk> <unk> that live in the <unk> <unk> of the world , <unk> that <unk> in the <unk> <unk> .
If we <unk> that these <unk> can create different , we could actually be different , we could actually start to understand some of them <unk> . I think that <unk> .
I <unk> this picture in <unk> in <unk> <unk> .
Maybe some of you have heard about the <unk> , the most powerful <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
What makes the <unk> is not the potential <unk> of the <unk> , but his <unk> . It 's <unk> by two elements .
On one side , this <unk> <unk> <unk> a series of <unk> , <unk> <unk> and <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
<unk> the only <unk> <unk> a little <unk> <unk> that <unk> a little bit , but it 's <unk> with the <unk> of a family <unk> <unk> said <unk> .
This <unk> <unk> <unk> , very similar to the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
If you ever see the <unk> <unk> on the <unk> , the <unk> that they do from a different <unk> of species , <unk> it <unk> .
<unk> that <unk> on the <unk> is a little bit like being <unk> by a <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> on a sea of electricity . <unk> 't create a <unk> of electricity ; it doesn 't create a <unk> of the reality .
I often with my <unk> , Richard <unk> <unk> , the man who <unk> the <unk> was <unk> , with his <unk> discovery of <unk> <unk> in the ' <unk> .
My <unk> is not to <unk> these <unk> as <unk> because if you 're done you can 't tell anybody to be <unk> . It 's <unk> . And the <unk> can 't be <unk> because they 're <unk> by a <unk> that <unk> in the <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
It 's possible to <unk> only if you could <unk> with other <unk> <unk> that <unk> the <unk> .
Now , the <unk> is the <unk> that are in this <unk> are <unk> <unk> , the same <unk> <unk> , the same <unk> <unk> , the same <unk> <unk> . The question <unk> : in a <unk> of <unk> species of plants , like these <unk> <unk> <unk> , they do <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , they create <unk> <unk> <unk> that 's <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> ?
We use the big <unk> of <unk> and <unk> , which can <unk> <unk> .
But if you <unk> , we 'll say , " <unk> <unk> . "
What does it mean ?
This <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , who <unk> <unk> in the forest , and that our eyes <unk> in the same species .
If you <unk> how to <unk> their <unk> <unk> , " <unk> <unk> <unk> , " <unk> <unk> <unk> , " I said , " No . "
The solution is : they take the <unk> <unk> in a night <unk> <unk> and <unk> with a different <unk> .
And so , you don 't <unk> to <unk> , but it 's much more interesting than <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Now , [ <unk> ] the problem is that the ones of us that have <unk> the <unk> <unk> them are <unk> , but somehow <unk> to the <unk> of history than our real world , and <unk> beyond .
In fact , the <unk> century , in 300 years , not <unk> <unk> for his <unk> or his <unk> <unk> , but rather as the <unk> was we <unk> and we <unk> <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> of diversity and <unk> , <unk> of the planet . Now , the problem is not the change . So , the problem is not the change .
All the <unk> through the <unk> have been <unk> in a <unk> for new <unk> of life .
And the problem is not technology .
<unk> <unk> don 't have <unk> to be <unk> when they put <unk> and <unk> and <unk> as the <unk> didn 't have <unk> to be <unk> when they <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
It 's not the change or technology that <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> . It 's power .
The <unk> <unk> of <unk> .
And if you look at the world , I 'll see that these are not <unk> <unk> to <unk> .
They 're <unk> creatures and <unk> <unk> out of the <unk> forces that go beyond their <unk> <unk> .
And I thought it 's going to be <unk> in the <unk> <unk> --
a <unk> <unk> <unk> , in the <unk> <unk> , a <unk> that lived in the forest to a generation ago , and now <unk> to the <unk> and the <unk> on the <unk> of the <unk> , where you can see the <unk> <unk> <unk> , where the <unk> <unk> <unk> , where the <unk> <unk> <unk> , where the <unk> <unk> <unk> , where the <unk> <unk> <unk> , where the <unk> <unk> <unk> ,
We 're going to <unk> the <unk> with the <unk> <unk> to the forest .
Or , in the case of the <unk> , are the diseases that are <unk> with the <unk> discovery of <unk> .
If you 're going to <unk> on the <unk> of the <unk> , where I 'm doing a lot of research , you 'll see the <unk> <unk> of politics .
As a <unk> <unk> , <unk> physics of a <unk> , is <unk> <unk> , but <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> of <unk> life of a <unk> , not just <unk> , but <unk> <unk> <unk> in certain <unk> , because it 's part of the developing <unk> .
And you can 't understand the <unk> of the <unk> until you get part of the <unk> .
I <unk> <unk> miles from <unk> in the <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> to <unk> with a young <unk> , but only got to <unk> . I realized what the <unk> behind .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> million people <unk> from the <unk> during the <unk> <unk> .
The father of this guy was <unk> to the <unk> <unk> .
And that means that it 's been <unk> to the Chinese <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
My mother was <unk> and his <unk> was to be <unk> .
It was taken by <unk> <unk> at age of two <unk> years <unk> under his <unk> because he couldn 't have to live without him .
The <unk> , who did the same , was <unk> in <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> , for this <unk> , was <unk> to the <unk> <unk> for seven years .
The pain of the <unk> can be <unk> , but the <unk> <unk> is from present <unk> .
And finally , everything <unk> to a choice .
Do you live in the <unk> world or we want to <unk> the <unk> world of diversity ?
The great <unk> <unk> <unk> , before she was <unk> , <unk> said that his greatest fear was that , in our <unk> <unk> <unk> of the human imagination to <unk> to a <unk> <unk> of human imagination to a <unk> <unk> <unk> of thinking , but a day we <unk> <unk> <unk> that there were other possibilities .
And it 's <unk> to remember that our species is <unk> for <unk> years .
The <unk> <unk> , who gave us agriculture , which has done us <unk> to the <unk> <unk> , <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> with the <unk> of the <unk> , creating the <unk> <unk> , and we talk about <unk> years ago .
The <unk> world has been <unk> 300 years .
That <unk> story , I don 't know that we have the answers to all the challenges that we 're going to <unk> in the <unk> .
When we 're in these <unk> <unk> of the world is asked what it means to be human , <unk> with <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And it 's in these answers that we all all <unk> the chance to be what we are : a <unk> species , which must be able to <unk> that all the <unk> and all the <unk> can <unk> . And there are great moments of <unk> .
I <unk> this picture on the <unk> <unk> of <unk> , when I went to <unk> <unk> <unk> with <unk> , and this man , <unk> , <unk> , I <unk> the wonderful story of his <unk> .
The government <unk> was not always <unk> with the <unk> <unk> and in the <unk> to <unk> our <unk> , we <unk> them in <unk> .
The <unk> of this man <unk> <unk> .
<unk> , family , <unk> for his life , <unk> the <unk> <unk> all the <unk> , and all his <unk> .
You know , you know , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> were made of <unk> fish <unk> in <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> of this man didn 't <unk> from night or <unk> <unk> .
It 's <unk> away , you know , you <unk> the <unk> <unk> and <unk> in your hand . When I did it , I did it , he 's <unk> him by creating a <unk> .
He <unk> <unk> on the <unk> of this <unk> <unk> , and when <unk> <unk> , he <unk> a dog .
He <unk> the dog and created a <unk> , with the <unk> <unk> has created a <unk> , has <unk> a <unk> , <unk> another dog , and <unk> on the <unk> , <unk> <unk> in <unk> .
<unk> to talk about <unk> ? <unk> [ <unk> ] . And this , in different ways , [ <unk> ] [ <unk> ] <unk> ] and all the <unk> <unk> of the world .
<unk> <unk> <unk> government <unk> to the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of an area of the largest <unk> of California and <unk> <unk> together .
It 's their new <unk> . It 's called <unk> .
It 's a <unk> <unk> . It 's all the <unk> resources .
One <unk> of how a <unk> can <unk> with his <unk> .
And , to end , I think it 's pretty <unk> at least to the people who 's been in these <unk> <unk> of the planet , I realized that they 're not going to be <unk> at all .
For someone is <unk> .
<unk> <unk> of the human imagination that <unk> to the <unk> of the time . And for all , the dreams of these children , as our children , become part of the <unk> of hope .
<unk> , we <unk> <unk> , we 're <unk> that <unk> never <unk> to anything .
I 'm going to say <unk> --
<unk> <unk> are not <unk> , but we believe that stories can change the world , and maybe we are the best <unk> to tell the stories of the world . Every month our <unk> <unk> <unk> million <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> our <unk> <unk> .
Our <unk> are <unk> by millions of people .
Our work is <unk> in the <unk> to bring our audience into places that <unk> <unk> from which <unk> <unk> from which <unk> <unk> from which they saw and <unk> , <unk> for the <unk> <unk> : the <unk> world of <unk> : the <unk> world of <unk> , and we have to find a <unk> <unk> in a <unk> world .
where the <unk> of all the <unk> can <unk> our <unk> <unk> .
Thank you .
I 'm going to talk about some of the things I 've written in this book that I hope you 've already heard and <unk> <unk> a few <unk> , in the case you don 't <unk> them .
I want to start with what I call " the <unk> <unk> . "
The <unk> <unk> of what ?
The <unk> <unk> of all the <unk> <unk> <unk> . The <unk> <unk> <unk> : " If we want to <unk> the <unk> of our citizens , " The way to do it is <unk> <unk> <unk> . "
The reason is , on one side , in fact that freedom is <unk> itself , it 's <unk> , <unk> for humans beings .
And then , it 's in fact that if we 're <unk> , each of us can act to do everything that we <unk> our <unk> , without no one <unk> that we 're going to be <unk> , without any <unk> in our name .
The way to <unk> the freedom is to <unk> choice .
More choices people have , more <unk> are <unk> , and the <unk> is their <unk> , <unk> is their <unk> , <unk> is their <unk> .
This , <unk> , it 's so <unk> <unk> in society that nobody <unk> <unk> in <unk> .
And it 's also <unk> <unk> in our lives .
I 'm going to show you some examples of what progress has made possible .
This is my <unk> . It 's not particularly big .
I <unk> a simple note on the <unk> to <unk> .
In my <unk> , there are <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and 12 <unk> <unk> that you can buy a huge number of <unk> in the <unk> <unk> that no one of the <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> that no one of the <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> that no one of the <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> <unk> that no one of the <unk> <unk> <unk> of your <unk> .
That 's what the <unk> is .
Then you go to the <unk> store <unk> <unk> : <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , radio , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
And in this single <unk> <unk> , there 's a big number of <unk> <unk> .
We can do six and a half million different <unk> using the <unk> that there are in one store .
<unk> <unk> that there is <unk> choice .
<unk> <unk> : the world of <unk> .
Once , when I was a child , you could get all the services <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> that they were <unk> by <unk> <unk> .
You <unk> the phone , you don 't <unk> it .
A <unk> of that , between the other , was that the <unk> never <unk> .
These days they went .
We have a <unk> <unk> <unk> , especially between cell phones .
Here 's the cell phones .
My <unk> is that in the middle , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , and <unk> for the <unk> <unk> .
If you don 't still have seen in the <unk> store , you 're very very well , you 're going to be very very <unk> .
And what 's the end of the end is that people <unk> in the <unk> and does this question . And you know , is the answer ? The answer is " No . "
It 's not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn 't face <unk> things .
So , in other <unk> of life that are much more important than <unk> , <unk> the same <unk> of choices .
<unk> <unk> : <unk> , not the more in the United States that you 're going to be <unk> .
Instead , <unk> by the <unk> , and the <unk> tells you , " OK , we could do it . Or you can do it . And they <unk> , you know , " <unk> , " <unk> , " <unk> , " <unk> , you know , what do you want to do ? "
You <unk> him , " What do you do ? "
And the <unk> says , " <unk> has these <unk> and these <unk> , and <unk> has these <unk> and these <unk> . "
" What do you want to do ? "
And you say , " <unk> if she was me , what ? "
And the <unk> : " But I 'm not her . "
The result we call it <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> that makes it look like a nice thing .
But actually it 's not a <unk> the weight and responsibility of the <unk> of the decisions that you know something , <unk> the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and so that it 's not <unk> to make a <unk> , and so not in the <unk> to make decisions about making decisions about the patient ?
There 's a huge <unk> of <unk> products , <unk> to people like me and you , if you think about it doesn 't make sense , because we can 't think that .
But if we can 't <unk> , why do we <unk> them ?
The answer is they want to <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And so fundamental , as our <unk> is our <unk> now is a question of choice , as you see in this <unk> , " We don 't want to <unk> kids . <unk> their sex at the right now . " We don 't want to <unk> a <unk> : we have to <unk> .
And we can <unk> how many times we <unk> us .
And that means that every <unk> , <unk> , you have to decide that kind of person you want to be .
And I <unk> to the family and <unk> , a <unk> , <unk> almost to anybody , was that was that you <unk> the <unk> <unk> as possible , and you <unk> to <unk> the <unk> <unk> .
The only only one one was with who , not when , and I even even what to do later .
<unk> , it 's really to play .
They 're going to be smart , and they 're going to <unk> them , 20 percent less work than a time .
And not because they 're less <unk> , not because they 're less <unk> .
But why are I <unk> , <unk> to <unk> , " <unk> <unk> or not ? "
" <unk> <unk> <unk> ? I have to think before kids or the career ? "
They 're <unk> <unk> .
And they try to <unk> these questions , even though this <unk> <unk> , even though this is not to <unk> the <unk> that <unk> and not to get a big <unk> to my <unk> .
And they have to do that . They 're really important questions .
Now , the work : we 're <unk> , as <unk> <unk> , because technology <unk> us work every minute , every day , from every day , from every <unk> of the planet , <unk> <unk> from the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , there 's a <unk> , and I 'm not going to tell anybody what , where the <unk> works .
I don 't tell you , because I want to use it .
What does this mean , this incredible freedom to be <unk> , <unk> that we have to decide , <unk> at any moment , if we have to work or not .
We can go to our son to <unk> , with the cell phone in a <unk> , the <unk> in the other , and the <unk> , <unk> , on the <unk> .
And even though I 'm all <unk> , every minute we see our child , we 're also <unk> , " I have to answer this call ? "
" I have to <unk> this <unk> ? I have to <unk> this letter ? "
And even when the answer is " no , that makes the experience of the <unk> of your <unk> very different than what it would be in other conditions .
So , from any <unk> , you look , little and big things , and <unk> and <unk> objects , life is a question of choices .
And one time the world was this : <unk> , there were some possibilities , but it wasn 't a question of choice .
The world of today is to this : The <unk> is , " Is it a <unk> thing , or <unk> ? "
The answer is <unk> .
<unk> <unk> them all , so I 'm going to talk about the <unk> .
And I 'm going to <unk> two effects , <unk> on people .
The first , <unk> , is that <unk> <unk> instead of <unk> .
With a lot of <unk> <unk> , it 's very difficult to do .
I 'll give you an <unk> <unk> : a study <unk> <unk> <unk> .
A <unk> of my <unk> had access to the <unk> data , <unk> society , with about a million <unk> in <unk> <unk> .
What she has discovered is that for every 10 solutions that are <unk> in more , the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> two percent .
With 50 <unk> <unk> , there 's 10 percent less <unk> than when they 're available to them . Why ?
Because with 50 <unk> <unk> of which one <unk> , is <unk> difficult to decide , and the choice is <unk> to <unk> .
And in <unk> , and still <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and of course <unk> never comes .
And I think that it doesn 't mean that these <unk> <unk> food to <unk> because they don 't have enough money , it 's also the decision is so <unk> that they 're also <unk> <unk> <unk> of the work .
<unk> <unk> : They 're not <unk> , they 're <unk> <unk> for <unk> year from the work , which would be well well <unk> .
So , <unk> is a <unk> of having <unk> choices .
And I think I 'll <unk> the world like this .
" And to end the <unk> : <unk> , <unk> , <unk> or <unk> ? "
You 're going to be the right decision , if it 's for <unk> , right ?
You don 't want to pick the <unk> , and you 'll <unk> the wrong <unk> .
So this is the first effect . The second is that even if we can <unk> <unk> the <unk> and make a choice , at the end , we 're less <unk> by the result of how to <unk> them with less <unk> .
And that 's a few reasons .
One of them is that with many <unk> between which one and one and it 's not perfect , it 's not perfect , it 's easy to imagine that they could be better . And what happens is that the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> us to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> <unk> by the decision , and the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> by the decision ,
And even when it was a decision .
More choices there are more choices to be <unk> than any <unk> that it 's <unk> of <unk> choice .
<unk> , there 's what <unk> <unk> call .
Dan <unk> has <unk> very well as as the value we give things to the <unk> things that we <unk> the <unk> things that we <unk> .
<unk> rest , when there are many <unk> possible , it 's easy to <unk> the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> and being less <unk> than the <unk> <unk> that 's choice .
Here 's an example . I 'm <unk> with all the ones that I 'm not in New York .
But that 's what you 're probably <unk> .
There 's this <unk> to <unk> .
A place of <unk> .
<unk> <unk> . <unk> day . It 's all about them .
I don 't know anything . But what he thinks is , " Well , <unk> , it 's <unk> . "
" All my <unk> <unk> are away . "
" <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in front of the home . "
And it <unk> two weeks from the idea that 's going to <unk> -- every day -- the <unk> of <unk> where it wants to .
The <unk> <unk> <unk> for what we have , even when the choice was <unk> .
And the <unk> are the <unk> we have from <unk> , the <unk> <unk> on how to <unk> .
Here 's another example .
This <unk> tells us a lot of things .
It 's about the moment , and maybe live in slowly .
But the most important thing is that anything you 're going to be , you 're not doing other .
The things that don 't <unk> have a lot of <unk> that can make less <unk> what we do .
<unk> <unk> : <unk> <unk> <unk> .
I tried it on my skin <unk> a new <unk> .
It 's almost always <unk> .
Once the <unk> were just one guy , <unk> them and <unk> them , they were <unk> , only after <unk> <unk> , they were <unk> , only after <unk> a life and <unk> a lot of times , <unk> to go well .
So , I was going to <unk> a new when the <unk> were gone , and I said , " I need a couple of <unk> , this is my <unk> . "
The <unk> said , " <unk> wants to <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> ? "
You want them to <unk> or <unk> ? "
" <unk> wants them to <unk> ? "
" <unk> <unk> <unk> them want to <unk> or <unk> ? <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> --
I was <unk> , and after a little bit I was able to say , " I want the guy that was the only guy " <unk> had no idea what was , so for a time . I all <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> , then I was the only one <unk> that I had ever had .
It was the <unk> . With all that choice I had <unk> the best .
But I 'm going to get worse .
Why ? I wrote a whole book to <unk> .
The reason I was worse is that with all that choice my whole <unk> was <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> to be <unk> .
I had <unk> <unk> . I didn 't know that I was <unk> <unk> when I just <unk> one guy , but when I was 100 different , at least one guy had to be perfect .
What I was <unk> was good , but not perfect .
After <unk> , I was <unk> with what I was <unk> in <unk> .
<unk> <unk> in the lives of people don 't make <unk> the <unk> that these have respect to the <unk> of the same <unk> .
And this <unk> <unk> , even when the results are good .
No one in the world of the <unk> <unk> .
Because if I <unk> it , I 'm not going to talk about what I 'm talking .
The truth is more to this .
And he was better when he was worse , " The reason he was going to be worse when you were worse , it was <unk> when you were even worse .
<unk> , in the world that we live in the world that we live in -- <unk> , <unk> <unk> that we can <unk> is that things are <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> .
You never want to <unk> <unk> , because your <unk> , my <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
The <unk> of happiness -- what you 're here -- is , " <unk> <unk> <unk> . " Yes , you want . "
I mean , little <unk> moment -- that I 'm really <unk> and my wife is really <unk> .
I couldn 't do better , I didn 't <unk> .
But <unk> not always a <unk> thing .
<unk> , a <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> <unk> when there 's only that kind of <unk> is that when you 're not <unk> , and I 'm going to tell you , why ? "
" Who is <unk> ? " <unk> , " <unk> is <unk> .
The world is the <unk> . What can I do ?
When you have hundreds of types of <unk> , and you 're going to <unk> one <unk> , and I 'll show you who 's the <unk> , it 's clear that the <unk> you are you .
I could do better .
With hundreds of <unk> available , there are not <unk> for the <unk> .
So when people make decisions , even though the result is <unk> , they <unk> <unk> and they give them <unk> to their own .
In the last few years , the <unk> is <unk> in the <unk> world .
I think a <unk> <unk> -- not the only , but important -- of this <unk> <unk> of <unk> is really that people have experiences because standard are too <unk> .
And when they have to <unk> this situation they think that the <unk> is they .
So the final result is that in general we 're better , <unk> , but we 're going to be worse worse .
Let me show you .
This is the <unk> <unk> , what we all take for good and it 's completely <unk> . It 's not true .
There 's no <unk> that a little bit better than a little bit of choice is not <unk> that a lot better than a little bit .
There 's a <unk> , <unk> . I don 't know what it is .
But I 'm sure we 've <unk> from a piece of the level in which the choices we <unk> our lives .
Now , from the <unk> <unk> -- I almost finished -- from the <unk> point , the <unk> is the <unk> .
What allows all this choice in the <unk> society is the <unk> material .
There are many places in the world , and you know , <unk> <unk> , where the problem is not that they have <unk> choice .
The problem is they have too <unk> .
So the <unk> I 'm talking about is a <unk> <unk> of <unk> , <unk> society .
And what <unk> does and <unk> is this : <unk> <unk> <unk> you yesterday about how those <unk> and <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> are <unk> . It 's a money <unk> .
I mean that these choices , <unk> and <unk> , is not that just <unk> .
They 're <unk> <unk> .
They do worse .
If a little bit of what in our society allows choice to be <unk> in those , where people have too few choices , it wouldn 't be <unk> to their life , but also our <unk> .
This is what <unk> call a <unk> <unk> .
A <unk> of the income is good for everybody -- not just the poor people -- because of this choice in <unk> that we 're going to be <unk> .
And to end , " <unk> , you can become everything you want --
<unk> , people of culture , <unk> , " But what do you ? "
" It 's <unk> that you can 't do anything in a glass <unk> . "
" A <unk> imagination , a <unk> <unk> of the world --
and I <unk> it so , I <unk> it , at the beginning .
But then , <unk> , instead , I realized that that the <unk> knows that fish knows that fish knows .
Because the reality of the <unk> is that if you <unk> the <unk> , so that it 's possible , " you can 't <unk> the freedom . You <unk> .
If you <unk> the <unk> <unk> so that it 's going to be able to <unk> the <unk> .
<unk> the <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Everybody needs a <unk> .
This is almost certainly too <unk> , maybe even the fish , and certainly for us .
But the <unk> of some <unk> <unk> is a <unk> for <unk> and , for <unk> .
Thank you very much .
