The last year I showed these <unk> to <unk> that the <unk> <unk> <unk> , who for almost three million years had the size of the United States <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , which is
So , we <unk> the <unk> of the problem because it 's not <unk> the ice <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> is , in a certain sense , the heart of the climate system .
They <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The next <unk> will be a <unk> <unk> on the last 25 years .
<unk> <unk> are <unk> in red .
You see , you see , you see it down to the blue <unk> .
That 's the ice in <unk> , which <unk> in summer .
You can see that the ice <unk> <unk> , of five years , is , is how blood blood , and here <unk> from the body .
In 25 years , it 's been so , in the way .
This is a problem because the <unk> is the <unk> <unk> in the ocean around the ocean where there are huge amount of <unk> that , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
<unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , that <unk> could <unk> , <unk> this point of not <unk> .
In some <unk> <unk> , there 's a little bit of <unk> the water .
<unk> <unk> <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> ! <unk> : <unk> . She 's going to be <unk> . The question is if we <unk> it .
One is that this <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> .
This is a river <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> never <unk> <unk> levels .
This is the <unk> river , in the <unk> of the <unk> .
If you want to know how the level of the sea <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> , here is where we 're <unk> the sea .
These <unk> are <unk> <unk> .
<unk> other side of the planet : <unk> , the largest <unk> of the ice of the planet .
The last month , the scientists have <unk> that the <unk> of the ice is in <unk> , and that <unk> <unk> on some <unk> <unk> , is particularly <unk> in the <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> , like <unk> , like in <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , the most big <unk> of ice , you see new <unk> , which few years ago were <unk> .
The 40 percent of the world population <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> : This is the source of the water <unk> of this city .
The <unk> is <unk> .
But when we <unk> , the same happens to the water .
In California , <unk> <unk> is <unk> of 40 percent .
<unk> <unk> are in the crisis .
<unk> , as you read , they 're <unk> .
<unk> <unk> in the world to a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> are <unk> to a <unk> out of the normal and without <unk> .
<unk> times more <unk> in the last 30 years , <unk> <unk> .
This is a <unk> of all <unk> .
If you look in the context context of the <unk> , you can see the <unk> .
In the last five years , we 've <unk> 70 million <unk> of CO2 every 24 hours -- 25 million <unk> in the ocean every day .
Look at the <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , to <unk> , and on both parts of the <unk> <unk> , where there 's a <unk> <unk> of oxygen in the ocean .
The most <unk> of global warming , together to the <unk> , which is 20 percent , is the use of <unk> <unk> .
The oil is a problem , and the <unk> is even even even worse .
The United States is one of the two countries with the <unk> , together .
And they <unk> to build a lot of other <unk> .
But we 're <unk> to a <unk> of direction .
These are the <unk> projects in the last and some of the <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
And there 's a <unk> politics in our country .
The <unk> of the <unk> and oil have <unk> <unk> <unk> million dollars in the last year to <unk> <unk> <unk> , which is a <unk> .
I 'll be <unk> something --
<unk> <unk> , in the <unk> , where live , there was a <unk> of <unk> billion <unk> .
Maybe you 've seen it on the <unk> .
This is the second second big <unk> <unk> in America .
It 's happened around <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> of one of the <unk> of <unk> was this .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> is a <unk> <unk> , a <unk> <unk> , and happy .
It 's <unk> here in America , and it 's <unk> our economy .
<unk> the <unk> is always more <unk> .
It 's <unk> , <unk> and the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> here is a lot of the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> .
The largest <unk> society is <unk> <unk> . This is his <unk> . This is his <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> <unk> -- Al <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> -- not know what they 're talking about .
<unk> : So the <unk> for the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> has two <unk> .
This is one of them , a part .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> <unk> , we see the changes of <unk> like a <unk> <unk> to our business .
So , our <unk> is <unk> a big amount of money in a <unk> <unk> to make the truth in a <unk> <unk> to <unk> .
In fact , the <unk> is not <unk> .
We think it 's <unk> -- it 's also a good <unk> .
So , it doesn 't <unk> of climate change .
We 're going to do it .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> <unk> -- you 've heard about a lot .
So , I <unk> a <unk> in a structure of the <unk> of <unk> .
<unk> ! The machines are a little bit of <unk> , but this is the sound of the technology of the <unk> of the technology of <unk> .
<unk> <unk> is between the main <unk> of global warming , but the technology of <unk> , but the technology of <unk> that you see it .
You look at a : this is the <unk> technology of the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> : <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to the economic question and the national <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> America is in the crisis ; the economy , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , the crisis .
The <unk> that <unk> all : our <unk> <unk> from the <unk> <unk> , like the <unk> <unk> and oil .
Now , there 's a new <unk> , <unk> solution to <unk> .
<unk> America : 100 percent of energy <unk> , in the <unk> .
A plan for <unk> America to work , <unk> <unk> , and help us <unk> the global <unk> .
<unk> , a solution that we could solve our problems .
<unk> America . <unk> of more .
<unk> : This is the last .
<unk> : <unk> : It 's <unk> energy to America .
One of the most <unk> ways of <unk> , at the <unk> that we <unk> our planet .
<unk> : The future is here . <unk> , <unk> , a new <unk> network .
<unk> <unk> : <unk> <unk> <unk> for <unk> jobs .
<unk> : <unk> America . It 's time to be <unk> .
<unk> : A old <unk> <unk> says , " If you want to go to the <unk> , you go to the only .
If you want to go away , you go to the <unk> . "
We have to go away , fast .
Thank you very much .
<unk> last year I did a <unk> on the <unk> .
And we <unk> to <unk> on how it works .
So , I <unk> . And for those that the other time , there were no <unk> , the <unk> is the largest <unk> <unk> <unk> -- <unk> miles .
<unk> is to <unk> the conditions that were in less than a <unk> of the beginning of the universe -- to <unk> million times in the universe -- to <unk> million times in the second .
All that 's just <unk> .
This is the car under the car <unk> .
And these <unk> <unk> <unk> into the <unk> .
This is what I work . It 's called <unk> -- it 's <unk> <unk> <unk> .
This is an image of <unk> in building so you can see the <unk> .
The 10 <unk> of last year we <unk> the car for the first time .
And this picture was <unk> by <unk> .
It was <unk> <unk> <unk> in the room .
It 's an image of the first <unk> of particles that had all the <unk> of the <unk> , <unk> , with a part of the <unk> , and <unk> particles inside the <unk> .
In other words , when I <unk> that image of 10 <unk> , <unk> , which is a big <unk> .
I don 't know if it was this to us <unk> more or this , when someone <unk> on Google and <unk> that the page was this .
What it means we had a impact <unk> beyond that .
And I was a week after , there was a problem with the car , we had to just these <unk> here -- these <unk> <unk> .
These <unk> <unk> <unk> when the car works in the <unk> of the <unk> .
Now , the <unk> between you <unk> the <unk> and <unk> , " It 's not true . I 'm too too . "
And they can do it because when they 're very <unk> <unk> <unk> .
So , to less <unk> degrees , at a temperature temperature <unk> to the space between the stars , these <unk> can bring that <unk> .
In one of the most <unk> of <unk> <unk> in the <unk> , there was a <unk> of <unk> .
So the <unk> <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> .
This was the result .
Now , this is still more <unk> if you think that these <unk> <unk> <unk> more than 20 <unk> , and that 's <unk> about about 30 <unk> .
They 're <unk> about 50 <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , what we did .
We <unk> them and <unk> .
Now , they 're going to <unk> them .
<unk> the end of <unk> the <unk> will be <unk> again .
<unk> , and we <unk> it , and we <unk> to get out of the data to <unk> or <unk> , and we 'll continue to find what the universe is .
Now , of course , in a certain way , these <unk> <unk> the <unk> of science and <unk> <unk> .
I think the fact that it 's so hard , the fact that it 's the value , I think it 's the value of things like .
I 'd like to <unk> with the words of one <unk> <unk> , which , <unk> , <unk> , which , in <unk> of the <unk> , and he was <unk> <unk> , he said , " No is a <unk> for the <unk> of human mind as the ideas that the ideas of human mind that the ideas of science , which are <unk> , that there are not <unk> in nature , that are <unk> , and they 're not going to be <unk> ,
Thank you .
I want to start <unk> to <unk> when , from children , <unk> , <unk> with <unk> .
<unk> as <unk> and <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , actually , to think about <unk> problems and <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> is <unk> <unk> to the way that we <unk> <unk> .
So , from <unk> <unk> of our <unk> <unk> with <unk> objects , and with my <unk> <unk> , and my <unk> <unk> <unk> , I started <unk> , " And if we use a computer , instead of <unk> , and when we use a computer , instead of having the <unk> of the <unk> like digital <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> with the hands , <unk> with both <unk> ,
and we <unk> to our <unk> ?
The question was so interesting that we 're going to <unk> to explore the answer , building .
In a few words , a <unk> is a <unk> computer as a <unk> .
In a few words , a <unk> is a <unk> computer as a <unk> .
You can <unk> it with your hand , you can <unk> with your hand , and feel the <unk> and a <unk> <unk> .
But <unk> , they 're <unk> objects , like <unk> , you can <unk> it .
The <unk> are the example of a new <unk> of tools to <unk> information information .
And as as as as they 're <unk> , <unk> of the other , of the other , and <unk> hand , as <unk> , <unk> , <unk> of the other , of how we can <unk> them , and we can explore and <unk> <unk> <unk> .
We 're going to <unk> with some simple example .
This <unk> is <unk> to show you video : if you <unk> it in a direction , the video <unk> <unk> so , if we <unk> from the other <unk> .
These <unk> <unk> are <unk> of other .
If you <unk> them , you know , you know , you know , if you 're going to <unk> them , and you 're going to <unk> them , and you 're going to <unk> them , and you 're going to go to .
If they 're <unk> , you can <unk> it , you can <unk> it .
If they 're <unk> , you can <unk> it , you can <unk> it .
They also <unk> their movement and <unk> .
And we realized that one of the interesting of the <unk> was the <unk> of the <unk> was that we can use <unk> on the data , to <unk> <unk> .
In this case , we have three <unk> <unk> as <unk> and I can <unk> to <unk> the color of the <unk> in the <unk> of the color of the <unk> .
And I can <unk> to <unk> the color in the central one , where you 're <unk> .
If you get too , we can <unk> a little bit to place .
I also also <unk> to <unk> , like <unk> , like <unk> , <unk> , the mathematics and <unk> the <unk> <unk> where people can try and <unk> things , and <unk> the <unk> <unk> .
I 'm --
This is a sequence of <unk> that I do with a program .
Here we have a <unk> of words that is half between the <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> , at every <unk> <unk> a letter to a letter to <unk> , <unk> , to every <unk> <unk> a letter to <unk> a letter to <unk> a <unk> <unk> .
And then , after about 30 seconds , and you have a new <unk> of <unk> and new <unk> .
Thank you .
Here 's the <unk> kids in <unk> <unk> , I did in the <unk> <unk> , I did in the <unk> and I <unk> a video .
They 're very <unk> .
And one of the interesting things of this kind of <unk> is that you don 't have to <unk> people .
<unk> only to say , " <unk> of words , " and they know exactly what to do .
Here 's other people who <unk> it .
This is our <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , there 's right .
It was just wanted to <unk> .
They were only <unk> , for him .
Now , this is an <unk> of a <unk> <unk> .
<unk> to build a <unk> for the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> .
It can <unk> new characters in the <unk> , <unk> their <unk> .
It can <unk> new characters in the <unk> , <unk> their <unk> .
Here 's what 's doing the sun .
<unk> : The sun is <unk> .
<unk> : Now he <unk> a <unk> in the <unk> .
<unk> : The <unk> <unk> .
<unk> work ! <unk> !
So , we <unk> the <unk> and <unk> can <unk> the characters --
<unk> : <unk> !
<unk> your story .
<unk> : <unk> !
<unk> : It 's a <unk> story , and you can decide him as you can <unk> .
<unk> : It 's a <unk> story , and you can decide him as you can <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> .
<unk> : The last example I 've got the last example I 've got to show you is a <unk> , to <unk> and <unk> music .
It 's a <unk> , <unk> <unk> , for <unk> and <unk> music .
The <unk> here is <unk> by <unk> like , <unk> , <unk> .
And you can have four different <unk> , and you can have to <unk> what to use .
You can also also <unk> these <unk> in a sequence of <unk> .
And we just <unk> a sound <unk> and a <unk> . " And a sequence . "
These are actually , you can control out of the live , like the <unk> and the <unk> .
I <unk> it at a particular sound and then <unk> to <unk> .
And then there are the <unk> <unk> , and we <unk> , and <unk> , and you <unk> to the whole sequence .
<unk> as it works .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> in two <unk> <unk> , " <unk> , the <unk> in a series , the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> other <unk> .
Now , let 's go to a <unk> line .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> . Now , <unk> <unk> <unk> --
<unk> : <unk> <unk> . And now we <unk> the <unk> to the <unk> , so I can control the effect of the live in the <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> : I can <unk> the whole time from one side or the other .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> . And now we 're going to <unk> the bottom to <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> , I can <unk> the sequence . "
So I don 't have to <unk> before , but I can <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
And now , I can <unk> the whole <unk> <unk> <unk> on the left left the <unk> <unk> .
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is to build new <unk> <unk> <unk> , more <unk> <unk> to how to work and body .
And I 've had time to show you one of the results of this <unk> , and also some possibility that we 're trying to get out of the lab .
The concept I want to <unk> is that 's <unk> this new generation of objects <unk> , which <unk> information in our world in our world way we want .
Thank you very much .
I don 't see the now I 'm going to talk to you .
They 're a <unk> .
<unk> books is my <unk> , but it 's more than this , of course .
It 's also love and the <unk> of my life .
And I don 't know that can change .
But , she said , something that is a particular <unk> in my life and in my career , and in my career , and I <unk> the whole relationship with this work .
The particular thing is that I wrote this book , this <unk> called " <unk> , " <unk> , " <unk> , " which , " <unk> , " which , " which , " <unk> , " which , " <unk> .
And the result is that <unk> <unk> now , people <unk> me as if I was <unk> .
<unk> -- <unk> , <unk> !
I 'll be <unk> to me , I 'll say , " You don 't know , I don 't think more to do better ?
You don 't fear to write to write the whole life without <unk> to create a book that can <unk> to create a book ? "
So that can <unk> to someone ? "
It 's <unk> , you know .
But it could go worse , and I remember that I remember that that I remember , when I was to say , to people -- I was a <unk> -- I was a <unk> .
I 'm going to be <unk> by the <unk> .
And people said , " I don 't know that they don 't have to be successful ?
You don 't fear that the <unk> of the <unk> you <unk> ?
You don 't fear to do this <unk> for all the life without nothing to come out and die on a <unk> of <unk> with the mouth of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> ? "
So , you know .
The answer -- the short answer to all these questions is , " Yes . "
And I 'm <unk> all those things .
I always had fear .
And I also fear of a lot of other things that people can 't be <unk> .
As the <unk> and other things .
But , to how to write it about what I thought and <unk> is why ?
Is it <unk> ?
It 's <unk> that anyone who <unk> <unk> to be <unk> by a job that you feel <unk> to do .
But what 's so , there 's so particular in the <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> in a way that other <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in a way that other <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in a way that we don 't do ?
How do my father , for example , he was a <unk> <unk> and I didn 't remember one time in the 40 years of <unk> in which the 40 years , and they were asked to be <unk> ?
And it was never -- that <unk> of the <unk> of John , how do ?
<unk> 't you know , <unk> ?
<unk> , the engineers like <unk> , <unk> , in the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> the <unk> of being <unk> <unk> .
We <unk> , we have enough this <unk> , and not only <unk> , but we 're not only <unk> , but we 're <unk> of all kinds of <unk> .
And they don 't <unk> another that look at the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> that , in the <unk> century , <unk> and often for them .
And even those that you don 't seem to be <unk> by their <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , before I was going to die , in the last <unk> said , " Every my book was a little bit more <unk> about the work of their life .
But we didn 't <unk> <unk> when I mean , you know , because we 've heard these things so we 're completely <unk> and <unk> the <unk> that creativity and <unk> are in some way that the art , and the art , at the end , we <unk> to <unk> .
And the question I want to <unk> to <unk> to all here is : you 're all the right ?
And it 's good to you know , because it 's also <unk> by a distance to me not good for anything to this <unk> .
I think it 's <unk> .
And I think it 's also <unk> and I don 't want to <unk> <unk> in the next century .
I think it 's better <unk> our big <unk> <unk> to live .
And I know , I know , in my case -- it would be very <unk> to start to start to <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> in which I 'm in my career .
<unk> -- look at the <unk> , I was rather a <unk> , I 've been about 40 years .
I still about four <unk> of work in me .
And it 's very <unk> that any <unk> of what 's going to be <unk> from the world as the work that I <unk> it after the <unk> of my last book .
<unk> <unk> , because we 're all more or less friends here -- is <unk> that my greatest <unk> is to my <unk> .
Oh , <unk> , <unk> , thinking !
You know , this is the kind of thought that 's a person to start <unk> to <unk> the <unk> <unk> in the morning and I don 't want to do it .
I 'll continue to do this work that I love .
So , the question becomes , how do ?
And so it seems to me , after a lot of <unk> , which the way to work to write to write to to write it , right ?
I have to find a distance of security between me , which I 'm <unk> , and my natural <unk> on which is going to get it . And my natural <unk> on what wrote to <unk> . And I 'm going to go through the time , trying to find more than what we 're trying to see if we have better <unk> and <unk> to see if we have better <unk> and see if we have more <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> to see if we have the the best <unk> <unk> and
about how to help people <unk> to <unk> the <unk> of creativity .
And that research <unk> me to the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
<unk> because they were <unk> and then <unk> back back .
<unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> -- people don 't believe that that creativity <unk> of men , OK ?
And it <unk> that creativity was this <unk> spirit , and that <unk> to men from a few <unk> <unk> and <unk> , for <unk> and <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> these <unk> <unk> of creativity of creativity , " <unk> . "
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> to have a <unk> that <unk> <unk> from from from far .
The <unk> were the same idea , but we 're going to be <unk> that species of the spirit without a <unk> .
The <unk> is <unk> , because the <unk> <unk> doesn 't really <unk> that a <unk> was somebody who who are particularly smart .
And I thought that a <unk> was this kind of <unk> <unk> that was literally <unk> in the <unk> of a artist , a little bit like the <unk> <unk> , and that <unk> out out out of the <unk> of the <unk> , and the result of that work .
<unk> <unk> , that 's the distance of which I talk about -- that <unk> you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you 'll see , <unk> <unk> that 's the distance of your work .
And all <unk> that was so that we <unk> , right ?
So the <unk> artists were <unk> by <unk> things , like for example , to <unk> , right ?
If your work was <unk> not <unk> <unk> all the <unk> , all of <unk> that <unk> was <unk> by this <unk> <unk> .
If your work <unk> work , it wasn 't all your <unk> , right ?
<unk> <unk> that was your <unk> to be a <unk> .
And so the <unk> people <unk> creativity in <unk> for a long time .
And then the <unk> <unk> and all <unk> this big idea ; we put this big idea in the middle of the universe , the middle of the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk>
This was the principle of the <unk> <unk> and the people <unk> to think that creativity creativity is completely <unk> from the <unk> .
And for the first time in history , <unk> to <unk> to this or that artist as a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And I have to <unk> , I think it was a big <unk> .
I think that I would be <unk> to somebody , a simple person to believe that as a source , the source of the <unk> , <unk> and the <unk> of all the <unk> <unk> , <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> it 's a <unk> <unk> .
It 's like to ask somebody to <unk> the sun .
<unk> and <unk> the <unk> and create all these <unk> <unk> on the <unk> .
And I think it was this pressure to have <unk> artists in the <unk> 500 years .
And , if this is true , and I think that 's , the question becomes , is it becomes , and now ?
We can do it <unk> ?
<unk> to go back to a more <unk> of the relationship between human and <unk> .
Or maybe no .
Maybe we can 't <unk> 500 years of <unk> thinking in a <unk> <unk> of 18 minutes .
And there 's probably people between the audience that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> on the <unk> of <unk> , <unk> , you do that <unk> people <unk> <unk> <unk> on their projects .
You 're not not going to <unk> you all about this thing .
But the question I 'd like to <unk> is -- why ?
Why don 't you know that ?
Because it has more sense of any other thing that has ever heard to explain the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> process .
One process that , like anyone who ever <unk> to do something -- so , <unk> , all here -- you know , you know , you know , you know , you don 't <unk> <unk> .
And in fact , it can be completely <unk> .
I did this <unk> <unk> with the <unk> <unk> <unk> , who has now now 90 years , but it 's been a <unk> for all the life and he <unk> me that during the <unk> <unk> , <unk> out in the <unk> , and the <unk> , if you go to the <unk> <unk> .
He said she was like a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And that <unk> <unk> to her from the <unk> .
I <unk> it , because he was <unk> the ground under his feet .
And I decided to have one thing to do that point and was , words , " <unk> , " <unk> like a <unk> . "
And so I <unk> to the house and it was <unk> by this <unk> , and it didn 't have to get another that we 're going to take a piece of paper and a <unk> <unk> on the page .
<unk> times , they didn 't <unk> to be enough , so <unk> and <unk> and <unk> it without able to get to home and the <unk> <unk> through the <unk> and the <unk> and <unk> it through the <unk> , and he would <unk> <unk> it , and he would be <unk> through the <unk> , and he would be <unk> with the <unk> , and <unk> , and he would be <unk> <unk> it , and
And then there were those times -- this is never <unk> the <unk> of the moments where the was almost <unk> , right ?
So , was <unk> to home and he was looking at home and the <unk> <unk> through the <unk> , and we <unk> a <unk> in the while that was <unk> , and then he was like , and then he was like that if you <unk> with the other hand and the <unk> .
<unk> the <unk> from the tail and the <unk> in his body and the <unk> on the page .
And in these cases , the <unk> would be <unk> on the <unk> page and <unk> , but the <unk> , from the last word .
So , when I <unk> it -- it 's <unk> , it 's exactly exactly <unk> to my <unk> process .
I don 't all my <unk> process -- I don 't have a <unk> !
I 'm a <unk> , and my way of <unk> is ; <unk> to the same <unk> every day and <unk> and <unk> on the <unk> .
But even I , in my <unk> , I <unk> against that thing , sometimes .
And I 'll <unk> that many of you <unk> the <unk> .
You know , even though , I work and ideas <unk> me to <unk> it from a certain source I couldn 't <unk> <unk> .
And what is this thing ?
And how can we <unk> it in it in the way we can 't get your head , but , rather , rather , what would <unk> <unk> ?
For how I was about the best example I 've got is the <unk> <unk> <unk> , which I 've <unk> different years ago for a <unk> .
And I talking about this , and you know , <unk> , for the <unk> of life was the <unk> of the <unk> artist <unk> , trying to <unk> these species of <unk> <unk> <unk> .
But then <unk> , <unk> , and a day as he was <unk> on a <unk> <unk> , <unk> all for him .
<unk> , <unk> , and all of a <unk> <unk> this little <unk> of <unk> , which is in its head as the <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , you know , it 's wonderful , and the <unk> , but it doesn 't know how to <unk> .
It 's not a piece of paper , not has a <unk> , not a <unk> .
So it starts to feel this kind of old <unk> <unk> in him in him , " I 'm going to <unk> , and <unk> <unk> from this <unk> .
I 'm not <unk> enough , I can 't <unk> . "
And instead of <unk> to go in the <unk> , they <unk> .
<unk> the whole <unk> process and <unk> .
I just <unk> the sky and said , " <unk> , you don 't see that I 'm <unk> ? "
" You know that it 's going to write a song now ?
If you really want to <unk> , you 're going to be <unk> , you know , if you can <unk> care of you .
<unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> another today .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . "
And his <unk> <unk> process after this .
I didn 't work , the work was still <unk> as always .
But the process , and the <unk> <unk> that was <unk> when he was <unk> when he <unk> the <unk> , the <unk> that 's <unk> out of him <unk> <unk> . And I <unk> it was going to be a <unk> and <unk> it .
But <unk> this <unk> , wonderful <unk> <unk> <unk> a conversation between <unk> and this thing that <unk> and <unk> that was not <unk> .
So , how much <unk> that story to change a little bit of the way I <unk> and already <unk> me .
This idea , I was <unk> when I was <unk> , " <unk> , " <unk> , " and <unk> in one of those <unk> <unk> in which we 're working on something and we can 't think that we can be a <unk> , which is going to be a <unk> , which is going to be the book .
Not only <unk> , just <unk> the <unk> book .
And we start thinking about <unk> this project .
But then I <unk> that <unk> to the air and <unk> us .
So I <unk> my face in the <unk> and <unk> my <unk> to a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And I said to <unk> <unk> , " <unk> , what , both we know if this book is not going to be <unk> <unk> my , not ?
Because you see I 'm <unk> all that I 've got to be <unk> everything I 've got no more than this .
So if you want to be better , you have to <unk> and do your part .
OK . But if you don 't do it , you know , I don 't know .
I 'll write the same because it 's my work .
And I 'd like to <unk> that was that I <unk> to do my <unk> . " Because -- at the end is so , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> , and the music that we <unk> to go to the <unk> of the <unk> , and the music that we 'll go to <unk> and hours to <unk> hours to <unk> hours to the <unk> and <unk> hours .
And they were always <unk> , because the <unk> were <unk> and were <unk> .
But every long , <unk> , something <unk> , something , and one of these <unk> <unk> in fact ,
And I know , I know , I talk about what I 'm going to talk about , at a certain point , a <unk> <unk> .
It was like if the time <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> through a kind of <unk> and was not doing anything else from the <unk> , as the <unk> <unk> , but it <unk> .
And it 's not just <unk> as a human .
But they <unk> out of the <unk> and <unk> under the <unk> of the <unk> .
And when this <unk> , at the time , the people <unk> what was , and he was <unk> with his name .
<unk> the hands and <unk> to <unk> , " <unk> , <unk> , God , God , " God , "
That 's God , you know .
<unk> <unk> -- when the <unk> <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> , <unk> this <unk> with them and <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , " <unk> , " <unk> , " <unk> , " <unk> , " <unk> , " <unk> , " <unk> , " <unk> , " <unk> , " <unk> , " <unk> , " <unk> , " <unk> , " <unk> , " <unk> , "
In <unk> , when a artist has done something impossible and <unk> , " <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> -- one of God .
And it 's <unk> because we need .
But the problem is the problem is the day after , for the <unk> , when you <unk> and <unk> that are the 11 of the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> God 's <unk> .
It 's just a <unk> with a lot of <unk> to <unk> , and maybe not <unk> to <unk> that <unk> .
And maybe nobody <unk> the name of God still still as <unk> , and what 's got to do with the rest of his life ?
It 's hard .
This is one of the most <unk> <unk> to do in a <unk> life .
But maybe it 's not to be so <unk> if you don 't believe , <unk> , that the most <unk> of your being being being being from you .
But I just <unk> that you 're <unk> you 're <unk> to you that <unk> you have to <unk> with another when you 're finished .
And , you know , if we think about this way .
And so I started <unk> , and it 's <unk> , and it 's <unk> , as I <unk> to different <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> ,
And what I have to go to <unk> when I feel that is , I don 't fear .
<unk> . <unk> only your work .
You 're going to <unk> for your hand , any can be .
If your work is <unk> , you know , you can 't be <unk> .
If the <unk> , you 're <unk> <unk> to you <unk> <unk> some kind of <unk> , for a <unk> moment through your <unk> , then you know , " <unk> ! "
<unk> , you do the same your <unk> .
And " <unk> ! " <unk> ! "
I think , and I think it 's <unk> .
" <unk> ! " <unk> ! " You know , to have had to be <unk> love and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Thank you .
Thank you .
<unk> <unk> : <unk> !
You know , I 've been talking about some of these projects on the human genome , on what can <unk> and discovery of <unk> <unk> .
Now we 're <unk> a new <unk> , we started to <unk> biology and now start from that digital code in a new <unk> of biology , <unk> and <unk> life .
We always tried to <unk> big questions .
" <unk> is the life ? " It 's something that many <unk> I think they have to understand to understand to different levels .
We 've tried different <unk> , <unk> to the <unk> terms of <unk> .
We 're <unk> from almost 20 years .
When we <unk> the human genome <unk> to the digital world of biology in the digital world of the computer .
Now we can <unk> us : we can <unk> life , or create new life from this digital universe ?
This is the map of a little <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , which is the species from the most <unk> between those that can <unk> in the lab .
And we tried to <unk> the genome to <unk> a <unk> <unk> a <unk> .
We 're able to <unk> a <unk> of <unk> , about 500 that are here .
But when we take a look at its <unk> map , is simple <unk> , is <unk> simple than our .
<unk> , this is simple .
But when we look at all the genes that we can <unk> , one at the time , is very <unk> that can take a <unk> cell <unk> .
So , I thought the only <unk> to <unk> was <unk> this <unk> in the way that we <unk> the <unk> to <unk> some of these questions .
And so we started the <unk> of " We can <unk> a <unk> ? "
Is it the <unk> chemistry to produce these big molecules that we never have ever been to create before we 're now ?
And in case , <unk> , we can <unk> it <unk> ?
A <unk> is just a piece of <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The speed that we 're able to <unk> life life is <unk> to <unk> <unk> .
Our ability to write the code , instead , <unk> , rather <unk> , but it 's <unk> .
And our most <unk> <unk> the <unk> of a <unk> .
We have more than 15 years ago .
The process has <unk> many <unk> , <unk> with a <unk> <unk> before we <unk> the first experiments .
But we found that <unk> of DNA is very hard .
There are <unk> of thousands of machines in the world that we <unk> small DNA , of <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , the <unk> is a <unk> process .
So we had to develop a new <unk> to <unk> these <unk> and <unk> the <unk> .
And this was our first <unk> , to start from digital information of the genome of the genome of <unk> <unk> .
It 's a little virus that we can see .
We designed the <unk> , <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> , <unk> the <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
The interesting part is when we got this piece of material <unk> <unk> and we <unk> it in the bacteria , the bacteria have <unk> to read this code and <unk> the particles .
<unk> particles are <unk> by the cells , they 're <unk> by the cells , and they <unk> the <unk> <unk> .
I talked about the <unk> industry that they have been <unk> with <unk> <unk> that they have of course .
They have more than you .
So , this is a situation where the software can actually build its same <unk> in a <unk> system .
But we 're going to do the most of it .
We 're going to build the <unk> of the <unk> .
It 's more than <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
So we thought of <unk> in the size of the virus , so we can change the <unk> to understand what they are the <unk> of a <unk> cell .
The <unk> is <unk> , and if we <unk> information in a computer , these are to be very <unk> .
When I <unk> this genome for the first time in the <unk> <unk> was a <unk> for every 10 <unk> <unk> .
We found , <unk> , 30 <unk> . If we were used that original sequence of the original <unk> never been able to do it .
One part of the process is to design <unk> 50 <unk> that <unk> with all the other <unk> of 50 <unk> to build <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> elements here .
You have to read that that we 're <unk> <unk> .
So , we have a <unk> code on four <unk> : <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> of those <unk> <unk> <unk> together , about 20 <unk> , and there 's a <unk> order to <unk> every <unk> .
So we can use the code to write words , <unk> , <unk> .
What we did at the beginning is <unk> .
Some of them were <unk> by the fact that it wasn 't <unk> .
We designed these <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> with <unk> .
There are <unk> that we <unk> them and <unk> them .
And we started <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> with <unk> <unk> , <unk> with <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> in the way to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
In every step , we 've got these <unk> in <unk> so that we 're <unk> to create a <unk> <unk> <unk> that we 're <unk> to create a minute .
We 're trying to <unk> the process .
So , this seems the <unk> of a <unk> of <unk> .
When I <unk> these <unk> very <unk> , more than 100 <unk> <unk> , not <unk> to <unk> in the <unk> <unk> .
You get to the <unk> of the <unk> of biology .
So we have <unk> other <unk> .
And I 'm going to <unk> <unk> <unk> , which in biology <unk> to <unk> the DNA in biology , to <unk> the <unk> .
Here 's a example .
This <unk> , called <unk> <unk> , can <unk> three million <unk> of <unk> .
You can see in the <unk> as his <unk> is <unk> .
<unk> -- 12 hours it 's <unk> exactly as it was before .
<unk> thousands of organisms that are able to do it .
These organisms can <unk> completely <unk> .
They were <unk> to live under <unk> .
They 're absolutely absolutely sure that life in space , and they <unk> to find new <unk> <unk> .
<unk> , the <unk> , NASA has shown that this is .
This is an image of the <unk> that we built using these <unk> , just using the <unk> with the design <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> <unk> .
This image was not <unk> with a <unk> <unk> , but with a <unk> <unk> .
It 's a <unk> <unk> so big that we can <unk> with a <unk> <unk> .
These are pictures that <unk> a time of about six seconds .
This is the <unk> that we did a little time ago .
It 's more than <unk> <unk> code .
It 's the <unk> <unk> of a <unk> structure ever <unk> from the man .
It 's got a <unk> weight to 300 million .
If you <unk> it with a 10 <unk> , we <unk> it with a <unk> <unk> , we 're only <unk> pages to <unk> this <unk> code .
Now , how do we do it ? How can we <unk> ?
Of course , through a virus is a game of kids .
It 's a little bit more <unk> when you use of bacteria .
It 's more simple when it 's about cells as well as our : you can just <unk> the <unk> and <unk> another , which is that 's <unk> .
In <unk> , <unk> , it 's <unk> in the cell , but we <unk> <unk> that we 're able to do a <unk> <unk> of a cell <unk> from one cell to another and <unk> .
We have a <unk> <unk> <unk> from a kind of <unk> .
The two different than men are how men from the <unk> .
We have <unk> some <unk> in more way that we could decide what to this <unk> .
<unk> <unk> all of the <unk> <unk> in the way that we <unk> all the <unk> .
And when we put it in the cell was <unk> and <unk> our <unk> <unk> the new <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And <unk> <unk> that we didn 't go beyond , but we tried to <unk> more in there .
This is one of the biggest <unk> of evolution .
We found that <unk> species have <unk> a second or a third <unk> , <unk> in a second thousands of <unk> , <unk> in a second thousands of <unk> <unk> in the species .
So who think about evolution as a only <unk> at the evolution of the biology .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> of <unk> that <unk> DNA .
The <unk> that was in the cell <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> that we <unk> .
It 's <unk> , and he <unk> the other <unk> as <unk> material , and <unk> us , and we <unk> it with only the cell and the new <unk> .
It 's become blue because of the genes that we <unk> .
And in a short <unk> of time , all the <unk> of a kind of <unk> , and you 're <unk> <unk> of all all the <unk> of all the new software that we <unk> in the cell .
All the <unk> are <unk> , the <unk> are <unk> , and when we <unk> the code <unk> exactly what we <unk> you .
Now , this may seem to be <unk> <unk> , but we can change the software we can change things in a <unk> enough .
Now , I 've already <unk> that you don 't talk about <unk> -- but to <unk> to <unk> -- but to start to create a new version of evolution , and I 've already said that maybe to create a new version of the <unk> <unk> in which we 're <unk> new species on this process .
Why do that ?
I think it 's enough to be <unk> when we think about our <unk> .
We 're going to go from six billion and a half billion people in the next 40 years .
So , to give a example : I was born in <unk> .
Now there are three people on the planet to <unk> <unk> in the <unk> ; they 're going to be four .
We 're <unk> problems now to find food , water <unk> and <unk> , <unk> and <unk> to six billion people .
<unk> more <unk> to do it for nine billion .
<unk> more than five billion <unk> , more than 30 billion billion <unk> <unk> .
That means percent million <unk> a day .
When we try to find <unk> <unk> , or any kind of process to <unk> , it 's going to be a huge challenge .
In the most <unk> we realized the <unk> of CO2 from these materials that we 're <unk> in the atmosphere .
And then , at the <unk> <unk> in all the world , we have a <unk> with about 20 million genes , and I like to think that are the <unk> <unk> for the future .
The <unk> industry is only a <unk> about <unk> , and think about how many different things are <unk> out .
Our <unk> here are <unk> data from the reality and our imagination .
Now we have <unk> , thank you to these <unk> <unk> <unk> , and to create what we call <unk> <unk> <unk> .
We 're able to build a big robot that can make a million <unk> a day .
Think of <unk> these 20 <unk> , or <unk> to try to <unk> the <unk> to produce the <unk> to produce <unk> or <unk> , new <unk> , we can change , with with <unk> , and create more <unk> biology now that in the last 20 years .
And it 's just a <unk> <unk> .
We can <unk> to <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
This is a <unk> of some software software <unk> that we 're working to be able to <unk> and <unk> species to the computer .
Well , we don 't know how they 're going to be .
We know exactly how they are the code .
Now we 're <unk> on the <unk> of <unk> generation .
You 've seen you know that <unk> <unk> from the <unk> was a <unk> experiment .
We have <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> enough , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> or different types of <unk> .
But the only way that biology can have a big impact without <unk> the cost of the food and <unk> the <unk> would be <unk> the CO2 in matter before , so we 're working for the <unk> of the <unk> that can get this <unk> , and we think we can get the first <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> .
The <unk> light <unk> with the CO2 is a <unk> , but in our <unk> <unk> all around the world , we found different <unk> .
This is a <unk> that we <unk> in the <unk> .
<unk> in the ocean , about <unk> feet of the <unk> of water .
<unk> <unk> from the CO2 using <unk> <unk> as <unk> .
We 're trying to understand if we can <unk> the CO2 , that can easily be <unk> through <unk> , <unk> that CO2 in <unk> , to <unk> this process .
So , we think that I could be able to <unk> what the question of " that is the <unk> of " that what is the life is , we <unk> the <unk> of the whole <unk> industry .
<unk> . If you can 't do it from TED , where can ?
It 's a main source of energy .
And we 're working , we 're working for the same <unk> to create <unk> .
You 've seen this year with the flu , we always go back to a dollar in less when it 's about it when it 's about to find the right right right .
I think what you can change in <unk> <unk> .
So , here 's how we start to be <unk> , now , the tree of evolution , <unk> the evolution of evolution , <unk> , <unk> , and finally <unk> .
We are in so much of the <unk> people .
Our purpose is to do that in order to live enough to try to try to try to try to <unk> . Thank you very much .
I 'll do to show you , the most <unk> , some of the new technology that we 've got to <unk> it in the <unk> <unk> <unk> to a year . This is <unk> . This is <unk> .
It 's a environment that you can <unk> is to the local level that we <unk> with a huge amount of data .
Here we 're seeing <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> with a kind of <unk> <unk> and <unk> , for a <unk> <unk> , <unk> the images as we want .
And it doesn 't matter how big is the amount of information that we see , how big are these <unk> of data or images .
Most of the most <unk> <unk> , but this for example is a <unk> <unk> by the <unk> of the <unk> , and <unk> in the <unk> of 300 <unk> .
It 's not a difference because the only thing that <unk> the <unk> of a system like this is the number of <unk> on your screen . It 's a very <unk> architecture .
This is a book , example of data is not <unk> .
This is the <unk> <unk> . Every <unk> <unk> <unk> . Every <unk> <unk> <unk> .
So , it 's just about the <unk> and not <unk> , we can do something like that , to see that it 's a real <unk> <unk> of the <unk> , not a picture of a picture .
It could be a way to be a little bit <unk> to read a book .
I don 't <unk> it .
This is a <unk> example . It 's a <unk> number of the <unk> .
Every image is the beginning of a <unk> .
And it makes you really <unk> to you the <unk> of the real <unk> version of a <unk> or a <unk> , which is to nature of a half a half a half a half .
We also did something with the corner of this <unk> <unk> , <unk> .
We created a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
If you want to see the <unk> of this <unk> , you can see here .
Or other models , or even the <unk> <unk> .
And this really <unk> some of these ideas to <unk> the <unk> of space on the screen .
And I thought this <unk> to put up to the <unk> and <unk> other <unk> , not <unk> to be <unk> .
Of course , the <unk> is one of the most <unk> <unk> for this kind of technology .
And on this is not to <unk> time , if we don 't say that we have <unk> to <unk> it in this field .
These are all the <unk> in the United States <unk> .
So now I 'll start something else .
This is actually in the web ; you can see it .
It 's a project called <unk> , which <unk> two different technologies .
One is <unk> and the other is a <unk> <unk> to the computer very interesting computer to <unk> <unk> , one of the <unk> of Washington , with the <unk> of Washington , with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . A <unk> <unk> .
And it 's in the web , <unk> <unk> .
You can <unk> when we do this kind of <unk> , where we can go from another and have this kind of experience <unk> <unk> .
But the <unk> <unk> of images here has actually actually a meaning .
And the <unk> of the computer have <unk> these images together , so that we 're going to <unk> in which the <unk> <unk> all <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> are <unk> . So , you see the <unk> of one <unk> or <unk> <unk> , and these things are all <unk> <unk> , and these things are <unk> <unk> , and these things are all <unk> <unk> .
I don 't know if I have time to show you some other environment .
There are a lot of more <unk> .
I want to go to one of the <unk> of data <unk> and this <unk> from a <unk> <unk> of <unk> that we 've done to be the <unk> summer for the summer to show you what we 've done is the key behind this technology , the <unk> technology , and it 's not <unk> as <unk> as we 're looking at the website .
We had to <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
This is a <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> <unk> images . <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> and <unk> images of <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> . And so we 're going to <unk> these <unk> <unk> <unk> .
So I 'm all <unk> images from <unk> and they 're all <unk> <unk> <unk> in this way .
And it 's possible to <unk> this <unk> way .
You know , I would never have thought to work to <unk> .
It 's very <unk> <unk> this kind of <unk> here .
I think that 's a lot of <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , a <unk> number , <unk> <unk> , <unk> together in this environment .
And if I can , I can try to look at those more <unk> .
There 's a lot of <unk> , etc .
And there 's a <unk> of <unk> -- <unk> .
This is a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
We can go from the physics of this environment .
The <unk> is that we can do with the social environment . This is now <unk> data from the whole memory of <unk> as <unk> the ground , from the <unk> <unk> of view , and we <unk> all of these data together .
All those pictures are <unk> together , more than the <unk> of the parts .
You have a model of the whole <unk> that <unk> .
Think about this as the <unk> of the work of <unk> <unk> <unk> on Earth .
It 's something that <unk> in complexity , and the people will <unk> it , and the <unk> that we <unk> it with the use .
Their pictures are <unk> with <unk> <unk> <unk> from other people .
If someone 's <unk> the idea of <unk> all these <unk> <unk> the name , my <unk> picture of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> all of those data , and I can use as a <unk> to <unk> in that space , using the picture of anyone , and <unk> , and <unk> .
Of course , a <unk> of all of this is very <unk> models of every interesting part of the land , <unk> not only from <unk> <unk> and <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> .
Chris Anderson : I realized ? What 's what your software is to do is that to do is that to do is that to do is that to be <unk> with anyone in the world will be <unk> together ?
<unk> : Yes . What 's doing is doing it is to find out .
It 's <unk> , if you want , you to see , between images .
And it 's doing it in the <unk> of images .
The thing becomes very interesting if you think about the <unk> of information that many of these images <unk> .
As you do a research of images on the web , you <unk> a <unk> and the <unk> on the web page has a lot of information about images .
Now , what 's going on if that picture is going to <unk> all your <unk> ?
So the amount of <unk> <unk> and the amount of <unk> that is really enormous . It 's a <unk> effect . It 's a <unk> effect of the network .
CA : <unk> , it 's really incredible .
<unk> : I 'll tell you very much .
One of the main <unk> when you <unk> and one of the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , between who don 't <unk> the <unk> <unk> , between those who don 't have <unk> the <unk> <unk> , <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> , <unk> of the plants .
<unk> thinking that the <unk> <unk> <unk> , or that the <unk> <unk> , or that the <unk> of <unk> are still <unk> <unk> , or <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , or <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> , and we 're <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> , and that the idea that the idea that the world that the world that the way we don 't have any sense , but it 's just a sense , but it 's <unk> that that we don 't have it 's <unk> that that that that that that that we have have a sense of
the <unk> of a particular <unk> of <unk> choices that our <unk> has done , well , or <unk> , many <unk> ago .
And , of course , all of the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
All <unk> . All <unk> .
We 're <unk> <unk> .
We have to <unk> the death of death , so we don 't have to <unk> it , if you know , and <unk> --
We all have a art .
What <unk> is the <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> of every culture .
<unk> 't matter that are the <unk> of the <unk> , or the <unk> of the <unk> , or the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> , or a <unk> in the heart of the <unk> , or a <unk> in the heart of the <unk> .
He was my <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> in the <unk> a month , or a <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of <unk> , on the <unk> , the <unk> mother of the world .
All these <unk> <unk> that there are other ways of <unk> that there are other ways of thinking , other ways to move in the world .
And , if you look at a moment , it 's a concept that can give you hope .
<unk> , the <unk> of the world create a <unk> of life and <unk> that <unk> the planet and it 's important for the <unk> of the planet as the <unk> <unk> <unk> as the <unk> <unk> .
And you can think about this <unk> <unk> as a <unk> and you can <unk> the <unk> of all the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> ,
The <unk> is the great <unk> of humanity .
It 's the <unk> of what we 're and what we can be in how <unk> .
And <unk> the <unk> was <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> was <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> much more <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , for example , <unk> that 50 percent of all the species was or the <unk> of all the species , because it 's <unk> , or -- in the <unk> of the <unk> , <unk> <unk> -- in the <unk> of the diversity -- and you don 't even even even <unk> in the <unk> <unk> -- that <unk> <unk> , that <unk> <unk> diversity .
The <unk> of all is , of course , the <unk> <unk> .
When you 're <unk> <unk> <unk> on this planet .
One language is not only by a <unk> or a series of rules .
One language is the <unk> of the spirit .
It 's the middle with which the <unk> of every culture comes in in the world .
Every language is a forest of mind , a <unk> , a thought , a thought , a <unk> of <unk> .
And of those <unk> <unk> <unk> , as we 're here in <unk> , at least half the <unk> of the kids .
They 're not <unk> to kids , which means , to say , to less than they 're already death .
What 's more <unk> of being <unk> in the <unk> , of being the last to talk to a language , not to have <unk> <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> or <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> or <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> ,
This <unk> <unk> was the state of someone in some of the world every two weeks : every two weeks , a <unk> <unk> and <unk> with it in the <unk> <unk> of a <unk> language .
And I know somebody of you know , " I don 't have better ?
The world would not be a better place if we 're all the same language ? " <unk> , then we 're talking about <unk> .
<unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , what it means means to say , to talk about their language .
Today I 'd like to do you to do a journey through the <unk> --
a little journey in the <unk> to give you a <unk> of what we 're <unk> .
Many of us <unk> that when I say , " different ways of <unk> . " I mean , really different ways of <unk> .
<unk> for example , this <unk> <unk> , <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> , which <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> .
It 's a <unk> that 's not able to <unk> the blue color of the green <unk> because the time is <unk> in the time , <unk> is <unk> in the time , <unk> the <unk> .
They have a <unk> language and a <unk> rule , <unk> <unk> , " <unk> <unk> , you have to <unk> a different language .
And it <unk> in the past <unk> , yet the <unk> is that in these families in which you 're talking six or seven <unk> <unk> <unk> .
You 're <unk> to listen and then <unk> to talk .
<unk> one of the most interesting <unk> with the I 've lived , the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , a <unk> <unk> that had the first <unk> in the <unk> .
In <unk> , five <unk> have <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
They made out of the top photographs that we <unk> them in <unk> that <unk> <unk> , <unk> that this <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> had never seen nothing <unk> .
They <unk> the <unk> picture , they <unk> to the <unk> of a form or a <unk> , and not <unk> , they <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> , and they <unk> the five <unk> with the <unk> .
But the <unk> <unk> not only <unk> the <unk> .
They <unk> between them .
<unk> percent of death death was <unk> by their own .
We 're <unk> eight <unk> and we found two cases of death and when we <unk> to know , they <unk> that one of them was so that they <unk> <unk> , and then they <unk> the same <unk> , and then they <unk> the same way , and then they <unk> the same way , they had a <unk> of <unk> .
The <unk> were able to recognize the animal <unk> from 40 <unk> and <unk> the species .
<unk> , the first <unk> , I was a very interesting job when my <unk> <unk> <unk> , if I wanted to go to <unk> <unk> with <unk> <unk> , if I go to <unk> <unk> between the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> and <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> .
So , to give a sense to the <unk> , I 'd to understand the <unk> culture and that the <unk> is not <unk> <unk> .
It 's pretty much of a <unk> <unk> <unk> of the world .
<unk> interesting .
If you <unk> to <unk> the big <unk> of the world , what do ?
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , etc . .
A continent is always <unk> out , thinking that Africa <unk> has no <unk> . And instead of the <unk> is not another that the <unk> of these <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> .
What makes the interesting is the <unk> of the <unk> between life and death .
So the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> can be <unk> by the <unk> <unk> , <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> and <unk> <unk> to the <unk> of the live in that for a short <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
So , the <unk> <unk> to say , " <unk> <unk> <unk> you go to talk about God .
We <unk> in the <unk> and <unk> God . "
And the moment you 're <unk> , is the spirit that you can <unk> you , how can you do you ?
So , you 're <unk> to these <unk> <unk> . <unk> in the state of <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a rather <unk> of the power of the body when it 's <unk> in one of the body <unk> .
And I <unk> the <unk> with the <unk> that I 've lived the most <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , in the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> of the <unk> civilization that once once we <unk> on the <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
In a <unk> continent , this <unk> never been <unk> by <unk> .
In <unk> , I 'm <unk> by a <unk> , but their <unk> is extraordinary .
The young <unk> are <unk> on the families to three or four years , and live <unk> in a world fact , <unk> in a world fact , <unk> <unk> <unk> to the <unk> <unk> for 18 years .
Two <unk> of nine years <unk> , I was <unk> by <unk> the nine months of <unk> that <unk> in the <unk> of the mother , now are <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> .
And so , all this time , they 're <unk> to values that their society , values that <unk> and only their <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> -- or to say the <unk> <unk> <unk> -- or to say the <unk> <unk> .
At the <unk> of this <unk> <unk> , they 're <unk> <unk> out and for the first time in their life , and see a <unk> . And in that <unk> of the first <unk> , when the sun <unk> <unk> <unk> , all that they 're going to be <unk> in theory is <unk> in the <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> <unk> , all that they 're going to have learned in the <unk> .
" <unk> ? I said , " <unk> , I said .
It 's <unk> . Now it 's <unk> . "
They call <unk> <unk> and they say that we , <unk> <unk> , we are the <unk> of the world .
This level of <unk> is extremely important .
And when we think about the <unk> and the <unk> environment , and the old story of the <unk> , which is a <unk> concept in its <unk> or maybe <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> , we say that these <unk> are more <unk> to the Earth .
<unk> <unk> are not <unk> <unk> or <unk> .
There 's no space for these things in the <unk> of the <unk> or in the <unk> of the <unk> , but to <unk> , with the <unk> of the Earth 's <unk> <unk> , but on a <unk> of <unk> <unk> , but on a <unk> <unk> , but on a <unk> <unk> , but it 's just about a <unk> <unk> of human <unk> .
What does that mean ?
<unk> to say that a <unk> of the <unk> that the mountain is a <unk> <unk> that the mountain is a human <unk> will be a human <unk> and <unk> <unk> . We have a <unk> <unk> that a <unk> of the mountain that we <unk> that a <unk> that a mountain is a <unk> <unk> that a mountain <unk> that a <unk> <unk> that a mountain is a <unk> <unk> .
That 's the <unk> of one or a <unk> <unk> is <unk> .
What is interesting is the <unk> that we <unk> the relationship between the <unk> and the natural world .
I grew up in the <unk> <unk> <unk> that the <unk> <unk> to be <unk> .
And this <unk> me a human being different from my <unk> that they believe that the <unk> are the <unk> of <unk> and the <unk> <unk> <unk> that live in the <unk> of the <unk> and the <unk> <unk> that live in the <unk> of the world , which we <unk> <unk> .
If we start to <unk> that these <unk> can create reality , <unk> to start understand some of the <unk> .
I <unk> this picture at <unk> in the <unk> <unk> .
Maybe some of you have heard about the <unk> , the most powerful <unk> <unk> of the <unk> ,
What makes the <unk> is not the potential potential <unk> , but its <unk> .
And in the side , this <unk> <unk> that has a series of <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
<unk> the only <unk> <unk> <unk> . It 's a <unk> <unk> that <unk> , but it 's <unk> with the <unk> of a <unk> of the family <unk> <unk> <unk> .
This <unk> <unk> <unk> , very similar to the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
If you 'll see the <unk> <unk> on the <unk> of the <unk> that they do from a different <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
<unk> that <unk> on the <unk> is a little bit like to be <unk> by a <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> on a <unk> of electricity . <unk> <unk> . <unk> 't create a <unk> of the reality ; it 's <unk> of the reality ; it 's <unk> .
I often had often often with my <unk> , Richard <unk> , the man who <unk> was <unk> , with his <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> in the <unk> .
My <unk> <unk> , you can 't <unk> these <unk> like <unk> because if you 're not going to tell nobody of being <unk> . <unk> <unk> . <unk> <unk> <unk> , but they can 't be <unk> because they 're <unk> by a <unk> that <unk> in the <unk> , <unk> .
It 's possible to <unk> <unk> , if you could <unk> with other <unk> that <unk> .
Now the beautiful : the <unk> that are in this <unk> are <unk> of the same kind of <unk> , the same kind of <unk> to <unk> the <unk> . The question <unk> <unk> : in a <unk> of <unk> , like these two <unk> , not like these <unk> <unk> <unk> .
We use the big <unk> of <unk> and the <unk> , which can <unk> <unk> .
But if you go to the <unk> , we 'll be <unk> , " The plants , "
What does that mean ?
This <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , who <unk> <unk> in the forest , and that we <unk> in the same species .
If the <unk> like <unk> their <unk> <unk> us , " <unk> <unk> , " <unk> <unk> , you don 't know all ? " I said , " No . "
The solution is : you get the <unk> <unk> in a night , <unk> <unk> with a <unk> <unk> .
With this , you don 't <unk> it , but it 's very interesting that we <unk> the <unk> .
Now , <unk> the problem is that even those of us that have to the heart <unk> <unk> them , but in some way we have <unk> to the <unk> of the history of the world , and over .
In fact , the <unk> century , in 300 years , not <unk> to <unk> or its <unk> <unk> , but rather as the <unk> <unk> , but rather as the <unk> of the <unk> of the mass of diversity and <unk> of the planet . Now , the problem is not the change .
All the <unk> through the <unk> were <unk> in a <unk> to new <unk> .
And the problem is not the technology .
<unk> <unk> <unk> , they didn 't have <unk> to be <unk> when they put out of the <unk> and <unk> .
It 's not the change or the technology that <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> . It 's the power .
The <unk> <unk> of the <unk> .
And if you look at the world , <unk> that these are not <unk> <unk> to <unk> .
They 're <unk> creatures and <unk> <unk> out of the existence of <unk> forces that go beyond their <unk> <unk> .
<unk> that <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk> --
a <unk> <unk> <unk> , where the <unk> <unk> , a <unk> that has been in the forest to a generation to a generation ago , and now we <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> , where the <unk> <unk> <unk> , where the <unk> <unk> <unk> , where the <unk> <unk> , where the <unk> <unk> <unk> , where the <unk> <unk> , where the <unk> <unk> , where the <unk> , where the <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> ,
We <unk> the <unk> with the <unk> <unk> <unk> to the forest .
Or , in the case of the <unk> , are the diseases that are <unk> with the <unk> of <unk> .
If you <unk> on the <unk> of the <unk> , where I 'm doing a lot of research , you 'll see the <unk> of politics .
As the <unk> , the <unk> of <unk> , is <unk> <unk> , is <unk> to <unk> , but the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of a <unk> , not only is <unk> , but <unk> in <unk> <unk> , because it 's part of the development .
And you can 't understand the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> until you can 't understand the beginning .
I went to the <unk> miles from <unk> in China , through the <unk> <unk> , <unk> with a young <unk> , but I had to <unk> it .
<unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> million people <unk> from the <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> .
The father of this guy was <unk> to the <unk> <unk> .
which means that it was <unk> to be <unk> to the Chinese days of the Chinese .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> that <unk> <unk> in the <unk> that <unk> in <unk> .
<unk> mother was <unk> and his <unk> was to be <unk> .
It was <unk> of <unk> in <unk> at the age of two years , <unk> <unk> , because it didn 't have to live in without him .
<unk> , which did the same , was <unk> in the <unk> <unk> .
A day has <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> and , for this <unk> , was <unk> to the work for seven years .
The pain of the <unk> can be <unk> , but the spirit <unk> of the <unk> is by <unk> .
And then , everything <unk> to a choice .
<unk> to live in the <unk> of the <unk> or we want to <unk> the world of diversity ?
The great <unk> <unk> <unk> , before they were going to die , and she said that his greatest <unk> was that , in our <unk> <unk> <unk> of the world , not only <unk> the whole <unk> of human imagination , but a day we would have to be a <unk> <unk> of thinking , but a <unk> <unk> <unk> that there were other <unk> that were other <unk> .
And it 's <unk> to remember that our species is <unk> for <unk> years .
<unk> <unk> , who <unk> us , and he <unk> us , and <unk> us to <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> , <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> , <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> , and we talk about <unk> years ago .
The <unk> world has <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And that <unk> story , I didn 't <unk> that we have the answers to all the challenges that we can <unk> in the <unk> to come .
When these <unk> <unk> of the world is asked what they wanted to be human , <unk> with <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And it 's in these answers that we all <unk> the possibility of being what we are : a <unk> species , which we have to <unk> and all the <unk> can <unk> . And there are big <unk> moments of <unk> . And there are big <unk> <unk> . And there are big <unk> <unk> <unk> .
I <unk> this picture on the <unk> <unk> of <unk> , when I went to <unk> with <unk> , and this <unk> , <unk> , and this <unk> , <unk> , and this <unk> , <unk> the wonderful story of his <unk> .
The government <unk> was not always <unk> with the <unk> <unk> and in the <unk> <unk> , and in the <unk> for the <unk> , we <unk> them .
The <unk> of this man <unk> <unk> .
The family , <unk> , <unk> for his life , the <unk> all of the <unk> , and all his <unk> .
You know that the <unk> doesn 't <unk> the cold , the <unk> .
The <unk> of the <unk> were made of <unk> fish in the skin of <unk> .
The <unk> of this man didn 't <unk> <unk> from the night or <unk> .
It 's <unk> on the <unk> in the skin of <unk> and <unk> in your hand . When I did it <unk> , I <unk> it , <unk> it <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
He <unk> <unk> on the <unk> of this <unk> of <unk> , and when <unk> <unk> , he <unk> a dog .
He <unk> the dog and created a <unk> , with the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> .
<unk> to talk about <unk> with nothing ? [ <unk> ] ] And this , in different ways , [ <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and all the <unk> <unk> of the world .
<unk> <unk> <unk> the government <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> of an area of <unk> <unk> , <unk> together .
It 's their new <unk> . It 's called <unk> .
It 's a <unk> <unk> . We <unk> all the resources .
One <unk> example of how a <unk> can <unk> with his <unk> .
And , to end , I think it 's rather <unk> at least who 's been in these <unk> <unk> , <unk> that are not <unk> all <unk> .
For somebody 's home is .
<unk> <unk> of the human imagination that we <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of these kids , like the <unk> of these kids , as the <unk> of the hope .
So , we <unk> <unk> <unk> , we <unk> <unk> that <unk> never <unk> to nothing .
<unk> that <unk> --
<unk> <unk> , they 're not <unk> , but we believe that we can change the world , and maybe we are the best <unk> to tell the stories of the world . Every month , we 're the <unk> <unk> million <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> our <unk> .
Our <unk> are <unk> by millions of people .
Our work is <unk> in the <unk> to bring our public in places that we <unk> <unk> from which <unk> <unk> from which <unk> <unk> , and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> for the <unk> of the <unk> : the <unk> of diversity , and we have to find a <unk> life in a <unk> world .
where the <unk> of all the <unk> can <unk> to our <unk> .
Thank you .
I 'm going to talk about some things that I wrote in this book that I hope you 've already heard of other <unk> , in case , in the case , you don 't <unk> .
I 'd like to start with what I call " the <unk> <unk> . "
The <unk> <unk> of what ?
The <unk> <unk> of all the society <unk> <unk> <unk> . The <unk> <unk> <unk> : " If we want to <unk> the <unk> of our citizens , " The way to do it is <unk> the <unk> . "
The reason is , from one side , in fact that the freedom is in the same value , is <unk> , <unk> for human beings .
<unk> another is in fact that if we 're <unk> , each of us can do to <unk> what we can do all that we <unk> our <unk> , without no one that we <unk> our <unk> ,
The way to <unk> the freedom is <unk> the choice .
The most choices people have , more <unk> , and it 's their <unk> , and it 's their <unk> , is their <unk> .
This , <unk> , is so <unk> <unk> in the society that nobody 's <unk> in <unk> .
And it 's also <unk> <unk> in our lives .
I 'll show you some examples of what the progress has made possible .
This is my <unk> . It 's not particularly big .
I was a simple <unk> on the <unk> to <unk> .
In my <unk> <unk> , there are <unk> <unk> , without <unk> the 10 <unk> of <unk> <unk> and 12 <unk> that you can buy for a huge number of <unk> in the <unk> that nobody of the <unk> <unk> <unk> that nobody of the <unk> <unk> <unk> that nobody of the <unk> <unk> is already <unk> .
Here 's what the <unk> .
And then you go to the <unk> <unk> to buy a <unk> : <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
And in this single <unk> <unk> , there 's a big number of <unk> <unk> .
We can do six million and a half a half of different <unk> using the <unk> that there are in a <unk> .
<unk> <unk> that there is <unk> choice .
<unk> <unk> : The world of the <unk> .
And I was a child , when I was a child , you could get all the services <unk> , <unk> that were <unk> by <unk> <unk> .
You know , the phone , you don 't <unk> it .
One of that , between the other , was that the phone never <unk> .
These days , they went .
We 're now a <unk> almost <unk> of <unk> , especially between the <unk> .
Here 's the <unk> of the future .
My <unk> is that in the middle , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , and <unk> for the <unk> <unk> .
If you don 't have the <unk> you still saw in the <unk> , you 're <unk> that soon .
And what 's what people <unk> <unk> in the <unk> and it does this question . And you know , it 's the answer ? The answer is , " No . "
It 's not possible to buy a cell cell phone that doesn 't 't do things .
So , in other things that are much more important than <unk> , <unk> the same <unk> of choices .
<unk> <unk> : <unk> <unk> you don 't see in the United States that you 're going to do .
Instead , <unk> from the <unk> , and the <unk> says , " OK , we could do it , or <unk> <unk> , " <unk> , " <unk> , " <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> these <unk> and these <unk> <unk> . What do you want ? "
You know , " <unk> , what do ? "
And the <unk> says , " <unk> , he 's these <unk> and these <unk> , and <unk> <unk> these <unk> . "
" What do you want to do ? "
And you 're <unk> , " <unk> if she was me , what do ? "
And the <unk> : " But I don 't have her . "
The result of the <unk> of the <unk> , " <unk> , " <unk> it makes it seem to be a beautiful thing .
But it 's not that one <unk> the weight and the responsibility of <unk> to take decisions from somebody who knows something , <unk> the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and it 's <unk> , so not in the <unk> to take the patient .
There 's a huge <unk> of products , <unk> , <unk> to people like me and you , if you think it doesn 't have any sense , because you can 't think it 's <unk> .
But if we can 't <unk> , why do we can 't we <unk> it ?
The answer is that they want to <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And so the fundamental <unk> like , is our <unk> <unk> is a question of choice , like you see in this <unk> <unk> . " We don 't want to <unk> the kids . " We don 't want to <unk> the kids . " We don 't have to <unk> .
And we can <unk> how many times we can <unk> us .
The that means that every <unk> , to <unk> , you have to decide that kind of person .
And I <unk> to the family and <unk> , a time the <unk> , almost for anyone , was that you could <unk> the <unk> as as possible , and you could <unk> to <unk> the <unk> .
The only only real choice was with , not when , and even what to do after .
<unk> , all is really to play .
<unk> to <unk> students , very smart , and <unk> their <unk> <unk> , in less than a time .
And they 're not because they 're not not because they 're less <unk> .
But why are <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , or not ? "
" <unk> <unk> <unk> later ? I have to think before kids or to career ? "
They 're <unk> <unk> .
And they try to answer these questions , even though this <unk> <unk> , and not get the <unk> that we don 't get a <unk> <unk> to my <unk> .
And they have to do it . They 're really important questions .
Now , the work : we 're <unk> , like <unk> , because technology technology us to work every day , from every day , from every <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , there 's a <unk> , and I don 't tell you what 's where the <unk> works .
I don 't say that , because I want to use it .
What does , this incredible freedom to choice that we have about to work ? It 's that we have to <unk> , <unk> in every time , if we we have to work or not .
We can go to see our child , with the <unk> in a <unk> , with the <unk> in the other , and the <unk> , <unk> , on the <unk> .
And even if I 'm all <unk> , every minute that we see our child <unk> , we 're also <unk> , " I have to answer this ? "
" I have to answer this <unk> ? I have to <unk> this letter ? "
And even when the answer is , " no , this makes the experience of your <unk> <unk> , very different <unk> from what it would be in other conditions .
So , from any part of the <unk> , little and big things , and <unk> of life , is a question of choices .
And once the world was this <unk> : <unk> , there were some possibility , but it was not a question of choice .
The world of <unk> today , <unk> is : " It 's a <unk> thing , or <unk> ? "
The answer is <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> <unk> them all , so I 'm going to talk about the <unk> .
<unk> this <unk> <unk> two actually actually <unk> on people .
The first <unk> , is that it <unk> <unk> .
With many <unk> between which to <unk> , becomes very hard to do .
I 'll give you a <unk> example : a study on the <unk> <unk> .
One of my <unk> had access to the data , the <unk> society , with about a million <unk> in <unk> <unk> .
And she found it was that for every 10 solutions that are <unk> in the most , the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of two percent .
With 50 <unk> <unk> , there 's 10 percent in less than <unk> when they 're available to <unk> , when they 're available . Why ?
Because with 50 <unk> <unk> , which to <unk> , is <unk> hard to decide , and the choice is <unk> to the <unk> .
And in <unk> , and again , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and of course , <unk> <unk> , and of course , it 's <unk> ,
<unk> that doesn 't mean that these <unk> <unk> <unk> food to <unk> because they don 't have enough money , to say that the decision is so <unk> that we also <unk> the <unk> <unk> of work .
<unk> , they 're not <unk> , they 're <unk> to five <unk> <unk> <unk> .
So the <unk> is a <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> choices .
And I think we <unk> the world .
" And to end , to the <unk> : <unk> , <unk> or <unk> ? "
<unk> just to take the right decision , if it 's for <unk> , right ?
You don 't want to <unk> the wrong wrong , and you 're going to <unk> the wrong wrong .
So this is the first effect . The second is that even if we can <unk> <unk> the <unk> and do a choice , at the end , we are less <unk> by the <unk> of how we have been with less <unk> in which we have to <unk> .
And this for different reasons .
One of these is that we 're all <unk> between which is that we could have one and not not perfect , it , it 's easy to be better . And that 's what 's going on is that the <unk> <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> the <unk> of choice , and the <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> ,
And it was also when it was a <unk> decision .
The more choices there are , more <unk> than any <unk> that is <unk> of <unk> .
<unk> , there is what the <unk> call <unk> <unk> .
Dan <unk> <unk> <unk> very well as the value that we <unk> to things that we <unk> to <unk> things that we <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , when there are many <unk> as we can , is easy to <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> that <unk> is choice .
Here 's a example . I <unk> with all the ones that are not in New York .
But it 's what we probably <unk> .
There 's this <unk> to <unk> .
A <unk> place .
<unk> <unk> . <unk> day . It 's all for them .
<unk> nothing . But what he thinks is , " Well , <unk> , it 's <unk> . "
" All my <unk> to <unk> are on . "
" <unk> <unk> <unk> right in front of the house . "
And it 's going to be two weeks from the idea that 's <unk> -- every day -- the possibility of <unk> where it wants .
The <unk> <unk> the <unk> for that we , even when choice was <unk> .
And the most <unk> that we have from <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> on the <unk> .
Here 's another example .
This <unk> tells us a lot of things .
It 's about the living moment , and maybe in the <unk> of the <unk> .
But the most important point is that any thing you 're going to <unk> , you 're not going to do other .
The things that they don 't have many <unk> that can make it less <unk> what we do .
<unk> <unk> : <unk> <unk> <unk> .
I tried to my skin <unk> a couple of <unk> .
<unk> almost always <unk> .
And once the <unk> were a only kind of <unk> , <unk> them and <unk> , they were <unk> , only after <unk> a life and <unk> a lot of times , <unk> to go to well .
So , I went to <unk> a couple of when the <unk> were <unk> , and I said , " I need a couple of <unk> , this is my <unk> . "
The <unk> <unk> said , " You want to <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> ? "
You want to <unk> or <unk> ? " <unk> ? " <unk> " <unk> ? "
" <unk> <unk> ? "
" <unk> <unk> <unk> or <unk> ? <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> --
I was <unk> , and after a little bit of I could say , " I want the kind of -- that was the only kind of -- I don 't have any idea of what I had to be <unk> <unk> , with the <unk> , and then <unk> <unk> <unk> , with the <unk> , with the best <unk> that I had ever <unk> .
It was the <unk> . With all that choice I had to <unk> the best .
But I 'll be worse .
Why ? I wrote a whole book for <unk> .
The reason I was was worse , and it 's that with all that choice my <unk> were <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
I had <unk> <unk> . I didn 't <unk> anything that was going to <unk> , when I just <unk> a kind of <unk> , at least one kind of <unk> , at least one kind of had to be perfect .
What I was <unk> was good , but not perfect .
After I had to <unk> that I was <unk> in <unk> to <unk> .
The <unk> of <unk> in life of people do not <unk> that <unk> that these have <unk> that these <unk> have <unk> than the same .
And this <unk> less <unk> , even when the results are good .
<unk> in the world of the <unk> if you get it .
Because if I <unk> it , I don 't know what I 'm talking about .
The truth is more than that .
" And he was better when he was was the <unk> for that he was better when she was was worse when she was was worse . And he was <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> , in the world that we live -- <unk> , <unk> , <unk> citizens with the <unk> of the <unk> -- the <unk> that we can <unk> is that things are <unk> .
You never have to <unk> <unk> because your <unk> , my <unk> , you have <unk> .
The <unk> of happiness -- what you 're here -- is , " <unk> <unk> " Yes , you want . "
I mean , little <unk> moment -- that I really <unk> , and my wife is really <unk> .
I could not do better , I didn 't have to do better , I would have no <unk> .
But <unk> , it 's not always a <unk> thing .
<unk> , a <unk> of <unk> <unk> when there is just that kind of <unk> is that when you 're not <unk> , and you 're not <unk> , and I 'll you say , " Why ? "
" Who is <unk> ? " <unk> is <unk> .
The world is the <unk> . What could you do it ?
When there are hundreds of <unk> , and you 're going to <unk> one , and I 'll <unk> you who is the <unk> , it 's <unk> that you are you .
I could do better .
With hundreds of <unk> <unk> , there are not <unk> for <unk> .
So , when people are <unk> , even though the result is <unk> , they <unk> <unk> and <unk> the <unk> to them .
In the last few years , it 's <unk> in the <unk> world .
I think a <unk> <unk> -- not the only , but important -- of this <unk> of this <unk> of <unk> is that people have been <unk> <unk> because the <unk> are too <unk> .
And when they have to <unk> this situation they 're going to be <unk> .
So the final result is that in general , we 're better , but we 're going to be <unk> .
I 'll tell you you .
This is the <unk> <unk> , what we 're all going to take for good and it 's not true .
There 's no <unk> that a little bit of choice is better than <unk> , but from this doesn 't <unk> that much choice is better than a little bit better .
There 's a <unk> value , <unk> . I don 't know what it 's .
But I 'm sure we 've <unk> from a piece of the level that the <unk> to <unk> our life .
Now , from the <unk> <unk> -- I 've been <unk> <unk> -- from the <unk> of view , the <unk> is the <unk> .
What it allows all this choice in the <unk> society is the <unk> material .
There are many places in the world , and you know , in which the problem is not that they have <unk> choice .
The problem is that they 're too <unk> .
So the <unk> I 'm talking about is a <unk> <unk> of <unk> , <unk> society .
And what <unk> <unk> is this : <unk> <unk> <unk> is this : <unk> <unk> you about how those <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> to <unk> are <unk> . It 's a <unk> of money .
I mean that these choices , <unk> and <unk> , is not that they 're just <unk> .
They 're <unk> <unk> .
They 're going to be worse .
If you have a little bit of what in our society allows us to <unk> choice was <unk> in those where people have too much <unk> , it would not only their life to be their life , but also our .
This is what the <unk> call a <unk> <unk> .
A <unk> of the income income is good to all -- not only the poor -- because of this choice in <unk> that we <unk> .
And to <unk> , you can become everything you want to be , "
<unk> , people , <unk> , <unk> , " But what do that fish ? "
" It 's <unk> that you can 't get anything in a <unk> of glass . "
" A <unk> imagination , a <unk> view of the world --
And I <unk> , I <unk> it so , at the beginning .
But then , <unk> , <unk> , I realized that fish knows that fish knows that fish knows the long knows .
Because the reality of the fact of the fact that if you <unk> it in <unk> , so that , " <unk> the <unk> . "
If you <unk> the <unk> in the way that we could <unk> the <unk> .
<unk> the <unk> , and <unk> the <unk> .
<unk> <unk> .
This is almost <unk> too <unk> , maybe even for the fish , and it 's <unk> for us .
But the <unk> of some <unk> <unk> is a <unk> for <unk> and , <unk> , for <unk> .
Thank you very much heart .
