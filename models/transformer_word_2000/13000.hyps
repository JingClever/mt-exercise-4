<unk> year I showed these <unk> to <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> , which for almost three million years has had the size of the United States <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
And I <unk> this <unk> the <unk> of the problem because it shows the ice <unk> .
<unk> <unk> is , in a sense , the heart <unk> of climate system .
They <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
The next one is going to be a <unk> <unk> on the last 25 years .
<unk> <unk> are <unk> in red .
As you see , you get <unk> to the blue <unk> .
That 's the ice in <unk> , which <unk> summer .
You can see that the ice <unk> , of five years or more , it 's like the blood , that 's like the blood , that 's <unk> from the body .
And in 25 years , in this way .
This is a problem because the <unk> is <unk> <unk> around the ocean where there are huge <unk> of <unk> that , <unk> , <unk> are <unk> in <unk> .
<unk> to <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> , <unk> , the <unk> of <unk> , that <unk> could <unk> , <unk> this point of not <unk> .
In a little <unk> <unk> in <unk> , the <unk> is already <unk> by the water .
The <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> is <unk> with a team <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> ! <unk> : She 's good . <unk> : She 's good .
A reason is that this <unk> <unk> <unk> by the <unk> .
This is a river in <unk> <unk> .
<unk> had never <unk> <unk> like that .
This is the <unk> river , in the <unk> of <unk> .
If you want to know how it goes up the sea level to <unk> <unk> , <unk> here is where the sea .
These <unk> are <unk> <unk> .
<unk> other hand on the planet : <unk> , the greatest <unk> of ice on the planet .
<unk> month , scientists have <unk> that the <unk> of ice is in <unk> , and that the <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> , <unk> on some <unk> <unk> , is particularly <unk> in <unk> .
<unk> at <unk> feet of the <unk> , like in <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> of ice , you see new <unk> , which a few years ago were <unk> .
<unk> percent of the world population <unk> half of <unk> water from that <unk> .
<unk> <unk> : this <unk> is the source of this city .
<unk> is <unk> .
But when you <unk> , the same happens to the <unk> water .
<unk> <unk> <unk> is <unk> <unk> <unk> is <unk> 40 percent .
<unk> <unk> are <unk> .
<unk> , as you read , they 're <unk> .
<unk> <unk> in the world leads to a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> are <unk> to a <unk> out of the normal and without <unk> .
<unk> times as <unk> in the last 30 years of <unk> <unk> .
This is a <unk> of all <unk> .
If you look at it in the <unk> context if you can see the <unk> .
In the last five years we 've <unk> 70 million <unk> of <unk> <unk> of <unk> every day .
Look at the <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and both <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , where there is a <unk> <unk> of oxygen in the oceans .
The <unk> of global warming , <unk> , <unk> , which is 20 percent , is the use of <unk> .
<unk> is a problem , and <unk> is even worse .
The United States is one of the two countries with <unk> emissions , together .
And they <unk> to build a lot of other <unk> .
But we 're <unk> to a <unk> of direction .
These are the <unk> projects over the last few years and some <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
And at all of that , there is a <unk> policy in our country .
<unk> <unk> and oil <unk> have <unk> million dollars in the last year to <unk> <unk> <unk> , which is a <unk> .
I <unk> you put something --
<unk> <unk> , in <unk> , where I live , there was a <unk> of <unk> billion <unk> of <unk> .
Maybe you saw it on the <unk> .
This is the second bigger <unk> of <unk> in America .
It 's happened around <unk> .
<unk> <unk> of one of the <unk> of <unk> was this .
<unk> : <unk> â™« <unk> <unk> is a <unk> and happy .
It 's <unk> here in America , and it makes our economy .
<unk> <unk> is <unk> .
It 's at good price , <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> here is a lot of <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The greatest society <unk> on the <unk> is <unk> . This is his <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> : <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> -- they don 't know what they 're talking about .
<unk> : So the <unk> for the <unk> <unk> has <unk> two <unk> .
This is one of them , one part of them .
<unk> : <unk> : <unk> <unk> , we see the climate change as a <unk> <unk> to our business .
So our <unk> is <unk> a great amount of money in a <unk> <unk> to make public and <unk> the truth on <unk> .
In fact , <unk> is not <unk> .
We think it 's <unk> -- it also also a good <unk> .
So we don 't <unk> about climate change .
We need to do .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> : <unk> <unk> -- you heard about it very much .
So I <unk> a <unk> structure of <unk> as <unk> is about <unk> <unk> .
<unk> ! <unk> cars are a little bit <unk> , but this is the sound of <unk> .
<unk> <unk> is between <unk> <unk> , but the <unk> technology of global warming , but <unk> technology that you see everything .
<unk> a look at : this is the <unk> technology .
<unk> : <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to the economic issue and the national security of national security .
<unk> : <unk> : America is in the crisis ; the <unk> , the national <unk> , the <unk> crisis .
The <unk> that <unk> all : our <unk> from the <unk> <unk> , like <unk> <unk> and oil .
Now , but there is a new , <unk> , <unk> solution to <unk> .
<unk> America : 100 percent of <unk> energy , in the <unk> .
A plan to <unk> America at work , <unk> , <unk> , and help us <unk> global warming .
<unk> , a solution that we could solve our problems .
<unk> America . <unk> more .
<unk> : This is the last .
<unk> : <unk> : It 's about <unk> energy .
One of the most <unk> ways to <unk> from the <unk> that <unk> our planet .
<unk> : The future is here . <unk> , a new network .
<unk> <unk> 2 : <unk> <unk> for <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> America . It 's time to be <unk> .
<unk> : A old <unk> <unk> says , " If you want to go to alone .
If you want to go away , you go to . "
We have to go far , quickly .
Thank you very much .
<unk> year at TED I did a <unk> on <unk> .
And I 'm going to try to <unk> about how the car works .
So it 's <unk> . And for those that the other time , there were no , the <unk> is the largest scientific experiment -- <unk> <unk> miles of <unk> .
His task is to <unk> the conditions that were in the <unk> of the universe -- to <unk> million times at the beginning of the universe -- to <unk> million times a second .
Everything is just <unk> .
This is the machine under <unk> .
<unk> these <unk> <unk> into the <unk> .
This is what I work . It 's called <unk> -- <unk> <unk> feet and has a <unk> of <unk> .
This is a picture of <unk> of <unk> in <unk> . So you can see the <unk> .
The <unk> last year we <unk> the machine for the first time .
And this picture was <unk> by <unk> .
It was because of <unk> <unk> in the <unk> .
It 's a picture of the first <unk> of particles that had done all the <unk> , <unk> in <unk> , <unk> , with a part of the <unk> , and <unk> particles in the <unk> .
In other words , when you <unk> this picture the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> machine , which is a great <unk> .
I don 't know if it was to <unk> us to <unk> than that , when somebody <unk> on Google and I would <unk> that the page was this .
That means we had a <unk> impact beyond that scientific .
<unk> a week later , there was a problem with the machine , we had to just these <unk> here -- these <unk> <unk> .
These <unk> <unk> <unk> when the machine works at the <unk> of the <unk> .
Now , the <unk> of you <unk> and <unk> , " It 's not true . I 'm <unk> too <unk> . "
And they can do it because when they 're very <unk> become <unk> <unk> .
So at least <unk> degrees , at a temperature <unk> at that <unk> of the space between stars , these <unk> can bring that <unk> .
In one of the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , there was a <unk> of <unk> .
So the <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
This was the result .
Now , this is even <unk> if you think of these <unk> <unk> over 20 <unk> , and that you 're <unk> about 30 <unk> .
They 're <unk> about 50 <unk> .
<unk> , what we did .
We <unk> them and <unk> .
They 're all <unk> to their <unk> place .
<unk> the end of <unk> the <unk> is going to be again .
We <unk> it , and we <unk> to get <unk> data to <unk> or <unk> , and so on our <unk> to find out what the <unk> are the <unk> that <unk> the universe .
Now , of course , in a way , these <unk> <unk> the <unk> of science and engineering engineering of <unk> . It 's easy to <unk> .
I think the fact that it 's so hard , the fact that it 's <unk> to go beyond <unk> , I think it 's the value of things like <unk> .
I want to end with the words of a <unk> <unk> , which , <unk> , <unk> , which , <unk> , in <unk> of <unk> , his <unk> was <unk> , his <unk> was <unk> , he said , " No <unk> for progress of human mind mind as <unk> that the ideas of science are <unk> , that there are no new , in nature , our <unk> are <unk> , and that are not by new <unk> .
Thank you .
I want to <unk> to <unk> when when , as children , <unk> with <unk> .
<unk> as <unk> and <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , <unk> , actually to think and <unk> problems .
<unk> <unk> is <unk> <unk> to the way that <unk> <unk> <unk> to us .
So , by <unk> <unk> of our <unk> with objects , and my <unk> <unk> , and my <unk> <unk> <unk> , and my <unk> <unk> <unk> , I started <unk> , " And if you use a computer , instead of only having the <unk> of the <unk> as a digital <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> ,
and <unk> to our <unk> ?
The question was so interesting that we wanted to explore the answer , building the <unk> .
In a few words , a <unk> is a <unk> computer as a <unk> .
In a few words , a <unk> is a <unk> computer as a <unk> .
You can <unk> with your hand , you can <unk> them with your own , you can hear their own movement and they have a screen and a <unk> radio .
But <unk> , I 'm <unk> objects , like <unk> , you can just <unk> .
<unk> is the example of a new <unk> of tools to <unk> information .
And as they become <unk> , <unk> of the <unk> , <unk> of the <unk> , of the <unk> , of the <unk> of their <unk> , of their <unk> movement , of the other , of how we can explore and <unk> of <unk> .
<unk> with some simple example .
This <unk> is <unk> to show you video : if you <unk> it into a direction , the video <unk> , so if you go to the other side back .
These <unk> <unk> are <unk> of others .
If you <unk> them , you <unk> to what they 're around .
If they 're <unk> , it and they can <unk> it a little bit .
If they 're <unk> , it and they can <unk> it a little bit .
They also <unk> their movement and <unk> .
We have to realize that one of the interesting <unk> of <unk> was the <unk> that we could use common on data , for example , <unk> , <unk> , like a <unk> .
In this case , we have three <unk> <unk> as a <unk> of <unk> and I can <unk> to <unk> of the color in that <unk> .
and I can <unk> to <unk> of the color in the central <unk> , where you <unk> .
We can <unk> it up a little bit of a place .
I also have <unk> <unk> to <unk> , like <unk> , <unk> , mathematics and <unk> , where people can try things things things very quickly , and <unk> the results immediately .
Now I 'm --
This is a sequence of <unk> that I do with a <unk> program .
Here we have a <unk> of words that 's in half of <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> , at every <unk> <unk> a letter to every <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , at every <unk> <unk> , and <unk> a letter to every <unk> , and as I was <unk> in <unk> .
Then , after about 30 seconds , you <unk> , and you have a new <unk> of <unk> and new possibilities to try .
Thank you .
Here 's the children <unk> in <unk> <unk> , I made it in a way that I <unk> them and I <unk> a video .
They 're very <unk> .
And one of the interesting things of this kind of <unk> is that you don 't have to give people a lot of <unk> .
I just say , " <unk> of the words , and they know exactly what to do .
Here 's other people who <unk> it .
This is our <unk> <unk> <unk> , over there on the right .
It just wanted to <unk> .
They were just <unk> , for him .
Now , this is a <unk> of a <unk> <unk> .
<unk> to build a <unk> for the <unk> of <unk> . He 's <unk> .
It can <unk> new characters in the scene , <unk> their <unk> .
It can <unk> new characters in the scene , <unk> their <unk> .
So , it 's <unk> out the sun .
<unk> : The sun is <unk> .
David <unk> : Now , he brought a <unk> in the scene .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> .
<unk> ! Yeah !
So we <unk> the <unk> and <unk> can <unk> the characters --
<unk> : <unk> !
<unk> their story .
<unk> : <unk> !
<unk> : It 's a story with open , and you can decide it as you <unk> .
<unk> : It 's a story with open , and you can decide it as you <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> away , <unk> .
<unk> : The last example I have time to show you is a <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> music .
It 's a <unk> , made of <unk> and <unk> music .
<unk> here <unk> <unk> as the <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> of these have four different <unk> , and you can choose which we use .
You can also <unk> these <unk> in a sequence of <unk> .
And I just <unk> to just <unk> a <unk> , and a sequence of the way . "
These are effects that you can be alive , like <unk> and <unk> .
I would <unk> it to a particular sound and then <unk> to <unk> .
And then there are the effects of as time and <unk> , that <unk> to the whole sequence .
It 's going to be like .
<unk> : <unk> : <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> in a series of <unk> , the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> ,
Now , you get a <unk> line .
<unk> : <unk> : <unk> of <unk> --
<unk> : <unk> : And now I 'm going to <unk> the <unk> , so I can control the effect of the live .
<unk> : <unk> : I can <unk> the whole sequence of time on one side or another .
<unk> : <unk> : And now we <unk> the <unk> to give more <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> : I can <unk> the sequence of the <unk> .
So I don 't have to <unk> before , but I can <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , over the way ,
And now , finally , I can <unk> the whole sequence of the left <unk> .
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is to build new <unk> <unk> <unk> and more <unk> to how our brain and body .
And today , I 've had time to show you one of the <unk> of this way , and also some possibilities that we try to bring out of the lab .
And the concept I want to <unk> is that 's <unk> this new generation of <unk> objects to <unk> with the <unk> media , which <unk> information in our world in the way we want .
Thank you very much .
I don 't see the time to talk with all of you .
I 'm a <unk> .
<unk> books is my <unk> , but it 's more than this , of course .
It 's also love and <unk> of my life .
And I don 't look like that it can change .
But , I said this , something that happened in my life and my career , which <unk> me to <unk> the whole relationship with this work .
The particular thing is I <unk> wrote this book , this <unk> called " <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
And the result is that everywhere I 'm <unk> now , people <unk> me as if I was <unk> .
<unk> -- <unk> , <unk> !
I 'm going to <unk> and they say , " You don 't fear that you can 't do it better than to do ?
You 're not afraid to keep <unk> to write for all life without <unk> to be able to create a book that can <unk> to somebody ? "
that can you get to somebody ? "
It 's <unk> , you know .
But it could go worse , and that 's <unk> , I remember that over 20 years ago , when I was to say to people -- I was a <unk> -- I wanted to be a <unk> .
I 'm going to <unk> the same <unk> <unk> .
And people said , " Don 't you know that we can 't have success ?
You 're not afraid that the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> ?
You don 't fear to do this <unk> for all life without anything that you 've ever come out and die on a <unk> of <unk> <unk> with the mouth of <unk> <unk> ?
So , you know .
The answer -- the short answer to all these questions is , " Yeah . "
Yeah , I fear of all those things .
I always had fear .
And I fear of a lot of other things that people can 't <unk> .
And as <unk> and other things <unk> .
But , as I think about it to write what I thought and I would you <unk> to do it ?
Is it <unk> ?
It 's <unk> that anyone who <unk> to be <unk> by a job that you feel born to do .
But what is so particular in the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> in a way that other <unk> don 't do ?
How did you know , he was a <unk> <unk> and I didn 't remember one time in his 40 years of activity where he was asked to be <unk> ?
It was never -- that <unk> of <unk> John , how do you go ?
<unk> : Don 't you that , <unk> ?
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> as a group of <unk> , <unk> the <unk> of being <unk> <unk> .
We <unk> , we have enough this <unk> , and not only <unk> but <unk> of all sorts of <unk> , we have this <unk> of being <unk> <unk> .
And they don 't know that look at the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> that , just in the <unk> century , <unk> young and often to them .
And those who don 't seem to be <unk> by their <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , before he died , in the last <unk> said , " Every my book has <unk> me a little bit more " <unk> . " A <unk> <unk> of his life .
But we don 't know when you say , because we heard these things so long that somehow we have <unk> and <unk> the <unk> that creativity and <unk> the <unk> that creativity and <unk> to be in a way that art , at the end , <unk> , we always <unk> to <unk> .
And the question I want to <unk> to all here is : you 're agree with this idea ?
It 's good for you -- because it also <unk> by a <unk> of a distance to me , it doesn 't good for this <unk> .
I think it 's <unk> .
And I think it 's also <unk> and I don 't want to <unk> in the next century .
I think it 's better <unk> our big <unk> to live .
And I certainly know that , in my case -- it would be very <unk> to start to <unk> to that <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> in which I 'm in my career .
<unk> -- <unk> , look at it , I 'm a young young , I 've about 40 years .
I still have about four <unk> of work in me .
And it 's very <unk> that anything <unk> of now , in the world like the work that I <unk> the <unk> <unk> of my last book .
<unk> <unk> , because we are all more or less friends here -- is <unk> that my greatest success is to my <unk> .
Oh , <unk> , <unk> , that thought !
You know this is the kind of thought that leads a person to start to <unk> <unk> on the morning and I don 't want to do it .
I 'm going to continue to do this work that I love .
So , the question becomes , how ?
And so I think , after many <unk> , that the way to work to keep on <unk> is to create a <unk> <unk> <unk> , OK ?
I have to do a <unk> distance of <unk> between me , which I 'm <unk> , and my natural <unk> on which <unk> that <unk> to get . And as I <unk> for all last year models of how to do we look through the time , trying to find other society to find out through time , to find other society to see if you have more <unk> ideas and more <unk> .
about how to help people <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> of creativity .
And that research took me to the <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> because I went to <unk> and then <unk> back .
<unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> -- people don 't believe that creativity <unk> from men , OK ?
It <unk> that creativity was this <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> to men from a few <unk> <unk> and <unk> , for <unk> and <unk> , for <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> <unk> these <unk> <unk> <unk> of creativity .
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> to have a <unk> that <unk> <unk> from far .
The <unk> were in the same idea , but <unk> that kind of spirit without a <unk> .
And that 's <unk> , because <unk> didn 't really <unk> that a <unk> was a particularly somebody who was particularly .
And I thought that a <unk> was this kind of <unk> <unk> that <unk> literally <unk> in the <unk> of a <unk> artist , a little bit like <unk> <unk> , and that <unk> out of <unk> <unk> , and <unk> the <unk> of that work .
<unk> <unk> , that 's the distance of which I 'm talking -- that <unk> <unk> you <unk> from the <unk> of your work .
And we all knew it was so that you would , right ?
So the artists were <unk> by <unk> things , like the too <unk> , for example , the too <unk> , right ?
If your job was <unk> not <unk> to <unk> all the <unk> , <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> by this <unk> <unk> .
If your job <unk> , it wasn 't all <unk> your , right ?
Everybody <unk> that was your <unk> to be a <unk> .
And so people <unk> <unk> creativity in <unk> for a long time .
Then the <unk> <unk> and all <unk> , and <unk> this great idea ; we put the human idea over the center of the universe , all the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> , without <unk> <unk> space and <unk> .
This was the principle of <unk> and people <unk> to think that creativity <unk> completely from <unk> .
And for the first time in the history , you <unk> to <unk> to this or that artist is a pretty <unk> that person to a <unk> <unk> .
And I have to <unk> , I think it was a big <unk> .
I think you know , a simple person to believe that it 's like a <unk> , like a source , <unk> and <unk> of all <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> and <unk> is a <unk> responsibility for human <unk> .
It 's like to ask someone to <unk> the sun .
<unk> and <unk> completely the <unk> and create all these <unk> <unk> on the <unk> .
And I think it 's been this pressure to have <unk> <unk> artists in <unk> 500 years .
And , if this is true , and I think it 's , the question becomes , and now ?
Can we do it ?
<unk> to go back to a <unk> understanding of human relationship between humans and <unk> .
Or maybe not .
Maybe we can 't <unk> 500 years of <unk> thought in a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And there 's probably people in the audience who <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> on their <unk> , <unk> , you do that <unk> people <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> on their projects .
You probably don 't <unk> you all about this thing .
But the question I 'd like to <unk> is -- why ?
Why not to <unk> this way ?
Because it has more than anything else I 've ever heard to explain the <unk> of <unk> process .
A process of that , as anyone who ever <unk> to do something -- so , basically , all here -- you know , you don 't <unk> <unk> .
And in fact , it can sometimes be completely <unk> .
I did this <unk> <unk> with the extraordinary <unk> <unk> , which has now 90 years , but it was a <unk> for all life and said that during his life and said that during his <unk> <unk> , <unk> out in the <unk> <unk> , <unk> out in the <unk> <unk> , and they <unk> it , in the <unk> .
He said it was like a <unk> <unk> of the air .
And she <unk> <unk> to her from the <unk> .
And he <unk> it , because he <unk> the land under his feet .
I was to have one thing to do to do to that point and was , his words like a <unk> . "
And so he went to home and it was <unk> by this <unk> , and it didn 't have to do anything else that take a piece of paper and a <unk> enough <unk> , as the <unk> , <unk> and <unk> on the page .
<unk> times we didn 't start to be <unk> , so <unk> and <unk> and <unk> without able to do it , and <unk> it without able to go to home and her <unk> and she would <unk> it up to <unk> through the <unk> , looking for , as she said , " another <unk> . "
Then there were those times -- this piece never <unk> it -- there were the moments when the was almost <unk> , OK ?
So , he was <unk> at home and he was trying to <unk> the <unk> through , and he <unk> a <unk> right in the while he was <unk> , and then he said , that was like if you <unk> with the other hand and <unk> .
<unk> the <unk> from the tail and the <unk> in his body and the <unk> on the page .
And in these cases , the <unk> would be <unk> on the <unk> page and <unk> but <unk> , the <unk> word to the first .
So when you <unk> it -- it 's <unk> , it 's <unk> , it 's <unk> to my process .
Not all my <unk> process -- I 'm not a <unk> !
I 'm a <unk> , and my way of <unk> is ; <unk> at the same <unk> every day and work and work and <unk> over <unk> .
But even me , in my <unk> , I <unk> against that thing , sometimes .
And I would say that a lot of you do it .
You know , even if the job and the ideas I <unk> <unk> from a certain source I could not <unk> <unk> .
And what is this thing ?
And how can we <unk> it in a way that we don 't have to <unk> your head , but rather , what would you do ?
So , I <unk> example , I <unk> <unk> that I have is the <unk> <unk> <unk> , which I <unk> different years ago for a <unk> .
<unk> of this , and you know , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> these <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> these <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
But then <unk> , he <unk> , and a day as he was <unk> on a <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> it all <unk> for him .
<unk> , you 're going to fast and all of a <unk> <unk> , that comes into his head like <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , and <unk> , and the wants , you know , it 's wonderful , and the <unk> , but it doesn 't know how to <unk> .
It doesn 't have a piece of paper , not a <unk> , it has no <unk> .
So he starts to hear this kind of old <unk> <unk> , " I 'm going to lose , and <unk> <unk> by this <unk> song .
I 'm not enough <unk> and I can 't <unk> . "
And instead of go to the <unk> , they <unk> .
<unk> the whole process of <unk> and made something completely new .
I just the sky and said , " <unk> , you know , you know I 'm <unk> ? "
" Do you think it can write a song now ?
If you really want to <unk> , <unk> at a <unk> moment when I can <unk> care of you .
<unk> , <unk> to <unk> more <unk> today .
<unk> <unk> <unk> . "
And his process <unk> <unk> after this .
Not the work , the job was still <unk> as always .
But the process , and the <unk> <unk> that <unk> was <unk> when I <unk> the <unk> , the <unk> that he <unk> out of he <unk> that he <unk> that he <unk> that had to be <unk> back from where it was , that it was <unk> that it had to be a <unk> and <unk> .
but <unk> this <unk> , wonderful <unk> , <unk> a conversation between <unk> and this <unk> thing and <unk> and this <unk> , but it was not <unk> .
So , as I <unk> that story to change a little bit of the way I <unk> that I <unk> and already <unk> once .
This idea , I <unk> when I was <unk> " <unk> , <unk> , " and <unk> , " and I <unk> in one of the <unk> <unk> where we 're working on something and you can think it 's going to be a <unk> , that 's going to be the <unk> book .
Not just <unk> , the <unk> book .
And I started to think about <unk> this project .
But then I <unk> to <unk> that <unk> to the air and <unk> us .
So I <unk> my face on the <unk> and <unk> my <unk> to a <unk> <unk> of the room .
And I said to <unk> , " <unk> , what if this book is not going to be <unk> , if this book is not going to be <unk> my , right ?
Because as you see I 'm <unk> all I have , I don 't have more than this .
So if you want it to be better , you have to <unk> and do your part .
Okay . But if you don 't do it , you know what , I don 't do it .
I started to write the same because it 's my work .
And I 'd like to do that it was <unk> that I <unk> to do my <unk> . " Because it 's so , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> music that <unk> , <unk> , <unk> music that <unk> , <unk> , <unk> music that <unk> hours to <unk> .
And they were always <unk> , because the <unk> were <unk> and they were <unk> .
But every <unk> , <unk> , something <unk> , and one of these <unk> artists , actually <unk> .
And I know you know what I 'm talking , because I know that you 've all seen , at a certain point , a <unk> like this .
It was like the time , and the <unk> <unk> through a kind of <unk> , and it was <unk> through a kind of <unk> , like <unk> <unk> <unk> before , but it <unk> <unk> .
And all of a sudden , not just like a human .
But it <unk> from <unk> and <unk> <unk> in the fire of <unk> .
And when this <unk> , at the time , people <unk> what he was , he <unk> it with his name .
<unk> your hands and <unk> to <unk> , " <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , God , "
That 's God , you know .
<unk> <unk> -- when the <unk> <unk> the <unk> of <unk> , <unk> this <unk> with them and the <unk> <unk> in <unk> by " <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , " <unk> , " which you can still hear in the <unk> or <unk> .
In <unk> , when an artist did something impossible and <unk> , " <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> -- a <unk> of God .
And it 's <unk> because we need .
But , the problem comes the day after , for the <unk> same , when you <unk> and <unk> that are 11 11 <unk> of <unk> and <unk> <unk> , God is no longer .
It 's just a <unk> with a lot of <unk> <unk> , and maybe never <unk> to that <unk> .
And maybe nobody <unk> the name of God still as I <unk> , and what 's got to do with the rest of his life ?
It 's hard .
This is one of the most <unk> <unk> to do in a <unk> life .
But maybe it doesn 't have to be so <unk> if you can 't believe , <unk> , <unk> the <unk> of your being being being being being being being being being yourself .
But I just <unk> you get data in <unk> from a source of this <unk> part of this <unk> part of your life that you have to <unk> when you finished .
And , you know , if we think about this way .
And so I started to <unk> , and it 's certainly like I <unk> for a <unk> of the book that I would <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> of my success .
And what I have to do is to <unk> when I feel <unk> from this is , I don 't fear .
Don 't <unk> . You just <unk> your job .
<unk> to <unk> for your side , whatever it can be .
If your job is <unk> , <unk> .
If you <unk> , you 'll <unk> to you <unk> <unk> some kind of <unk> , for one moment through your <unk> , then , " <unk> ! "
<unk> , you do the same your <unk> .
And " <unk> ! " <unk> ! " <unk> .
I think , and I think it 's <unk> .
" <unk> ! " <unk> ! " <unk> , " <unk> ! " <unk> , " <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Thank you .
Thank you .
<unk> <unk> : <unk> !
As I 've already talked about some of these projects on the human genome , what can <unk> and the discovery of new genes .
We 're <unk> a new way : we started to <unk> biology and now starting to <unk> biology and now starting to <unk> the digital code of biology , <unk> and <unk> life .
We 've always tried to <unk> big questions .
" <unk> is life ? " It 's something that many <unk> I think have <unk> to understand at various levels .
We 've tried <unk> , <unk> to <unk> terms .
We 're <unk> by almost 20 years .
When we <unk> the human genome <unk> to go to the digital world of the computer biology world .
Now , we <unk> : can <unk> life , or create new life from this digital universe ?
This is a map of a little <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , which is the species from the <unk> genome that can <unk> in the lab .
And we tried to reduce <unk> the genome to <unk> a little bit smaller .
We 're able to <unk> a <unk> of <unk> of <unk> <unk> that are here .
But when we look at his <unk> map , it 's <unk> simple than our .
<unk> , this is simple .
But when we look at all the genes that we can <unk> , one at the time , is very <unk> that this can bring a <unk> cell .
So I would <unk> that the only way to <unk> was <unk> this <unk> so that we <unk> <unk> to <unk> some of these questions .
So we started the <unk> of " We can <unk> a <unk> ? "
Can the chemistry <unk> to produce these big molecules that we have never been able to create before ?
And , in case , <unk> , can we make a <unk> ?
A <unk> is just a piece of <unk> material .
The speed that we 're able to <unk> life is <unk> to <unk> <unk> .
Our <unk> of <unk> the code , instead of <unk> , <unk> rather slowly , but it 's <unk> .
And our <unk> <unk> the <unk> on a <unk> <unk> .
We 've <unk> over 15 years ago .
The process has <unk> a lot of <unk> , <unk> with a <unk> <unk> before I <unk> the early experiments .
But we found that DNA <unk> is very hard .
There are <unk> of thousands of cars in the world that <unk> <unk> , <unk> of 30 to 50 <unk> and it 's a <unk> process . <unk> is a <unk> process . <unk> is a <unk> process , the <unk> is along , over .
So we had to develop a new <unk> to <unk> these <unk> and <unk> the <unk> .
And this was our first <unk> , to start from digital information of <unk> <unk> <unk> .
It 's a little <unk> that bacteria <unk> .
We designed the <unk> , <unk> the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> a <unk> of DNA <unk> of about <unk> <unk> .
The interesting part is when we took this piece of <unk> material , and we <unk> it in bacteria , bacteria have <unk> to read this code and <unk> the <unk> particles .
<unk> particles have been <unk> by cells , they 're <unk> back and they <unk> the <unk> .
I 've talked about recently with members of the <unk> industry that they have certainly <unk> this model .
They have more than you .
<unk> that 's a situation where the software can actually actually build his same <unk> in a <unk> system .
But we do the greatest things in the big .
We wanted to build the whole <unk> of <unk> .
They 're more than <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> code .
So we thought of <unk> in <unk> <unk> of the <unk> , so that we can change the <unk> to understand what the <unk> of a <unk> cell .
<unk> is <unk> , and if you <unk> information with <unk> information in a computer , these must be very <unk> .
When I <unk> this genome for the first time in <unk> the <unk> <unk> of a <unk> for every 10 <unk> <unk> .
We 've found , <unk> , 30 <unk> . If you <unk> that original <unk> , you never had to do it work .
A process of the process is to design <unk> <unk> that <unk> with all the other <unk> of 50 <unk> to build <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to build smaller <unk> <unk> that <unk> together .
<unk> elements here .
You probably read that <unk> <unk> .
<unk> : We have a <unk> code <unk> on four <unk> : A , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> of those <unk> <unk> <unk> , and there 's a <unk> order of <unk> for every <unk> .
So we can use the code to write words , <unk> , <unk> .
What we did at the beginning was <unk> .
Some of them have been <unk> by the fact that it wasn 't <unk> .
We designed these <unk> to <unk> just <unk> with <unk> .
There are <unk> that <unk> them and <unk> them .
And we started to <unk> <unk> <unk> . <unk> with <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to them to <unk> <unk> <unk> .
But in every step we made these <unk> in <unk> so that we 're <unk> to create a very <unk> <unk> , very <unk> as you see in a minute .
We 're trying to <unk> the process .
So this seems to the <unk> of a <unk> of <unk> .
When you go to these <unk> <unk> <unk> , the <unk> of 100 <unk> <unk> , I don 't get <unk> directly to the <unk> <unk> .
You get to the <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> biology .
So we 've <unk> other <unk> .
<unk> of another <unk> called <unk> <unk> , which in biology <unk> to <unk> DNA that in biology <unk> to <unk> the DNA .
Here 's an example .
This <unk> , called <unk> <unk> , can <unk> three million <unk> of <unk> .
You can see in the <unk> <unk> as his <unk> is <unk> .
<unk> , 12 hours it 's <unk> exactly like it was before .
<unk> thousands of organisms that are able to do it .
These organisms can <unk> completely .
They 're living under <unk> .
I 'm absolutely sure that life <unk> in space , and they <unk> to find new <unk> of water .
<unk> , NASA has shown that this is .
This is a picture of the <unk> that we built , just using these <unk> , just using these <unk> , just using the <unk> design of <unk> .
<unk> <unk> them .
This picture was not <unk> with a <unk> <unk> , but with a <unk> <unk> .
It 's a <unk> so big that we can <unk> with a <unk> <unk> .
These are pictures that <unk> a period of about six seconds .
This is the <unk> that we did a little time ago .
They 're more than <unk> <unk> of <unk> code .
It 's the greatest <unk> of a <unk> <unk> .
It 's got <unk> <unk> to 300 million .
If you <unk> it with a <unk> 10 without spaces , we <unk> only to <unk> this code .
Now , how do we do it ? How do we <unk> ?
<unk> , through a virus is a <unk> .
It 's a little <unk> when you use bacteria .
It 's <unk> even when it 's <unk> cells as our : you can just <unk> the <unk> and <unk> another , which is basically the <unk> process .
In <unk> , <unk> , the <unk> is <unk> in the cell , but we <unk> <unk> that we are able to do a <unk> <unk> of a cell to another and <unk> .
We <unk> a <unk> <unk> from a kind of a <unk> .
<unk> are different than men from <unk> .
We <unk> some <unk> in more <unk> way that we could decide what to do for this <unk> .
He <unk> it with the <unk> in a way that we <unk> all the <unk> .
And when we put it in the cell was <unk> and <unk> our <unk> <unk> the new <unk> went into the cell .
And <unk> <unk> that we don 't go beyond , but we tried to <unk> over there .
This is one of the <unk> of evolution .
We found that <unk> species have <unk> a second or a third <unk> by a third <unk> of a few part of new <unk> to that species .
So who think about evolution as a <unk> only <unk> at the time you can <unk> not <unk> a lot of biology .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> the DNA .
The <unk> that was in the cell didn 't get one .
The <unk> <unk> we have <unk> it .
It 's <unk> , and it <unk> the other <unk> as <unk> material , has <unk> , and we <unk> with only the cell and the new <unk> .
It 's become blue because of genes that we <unk> .
And in a short <unk> of time , all the <unk> of a species are <unk> <unk> , and it <unk> of all in a new software species , <unk> on the new software , which we <unk> in the cell .
All the <unk> are <unk> , the <unk> are <unk> , and when you get the code <unk> exactly to what we 've <unk> .
Now , this may seem <unk> <unk> , but we can <unk> the software things in a pretty <unk> .
Now , I 've already <unk> that you don 't talk about <unk> -- but <unk> progress to go from three million years and a half of evolution , and I said that maybe we 're going to create a new version of <unk> <unk> that <unk> that <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> that <unk> new species on this process .
Why do that ?
I think it 's quite <unk> when we think about our <unk> .
We 're going to go from six and a half billion people to <unk> billion in the next 40 years .
Just to give you an example : I was born in <unk> .
Now , there are three people on the planet to <unk> <unk> ; in 40 years , there 's going to be four .
We 're <unk> now to find food , <unk> and <unk> , <unk> and <unk> and <unk> for six and a half billion people .
We 're even <unk> to do it for nine billion .
<unk> more than five billion <unk> , over 30 billion <unk> of <unk> .
That means percent million <unk> a day .
When we try to find <unk> <unk> , or whatever kind of process to <unk> , it will be a huge challenge .
We have to realize all of CO2 <unk> by these materials that <unk> in the atmosphere .
And now , thank you to <unk> <unk> around the world , we have a <unk> with about 20 million genes , and I like to think that are the <unk> <unk> for the future .
The <unk> industry <unk> just a <unk> about <unk> , and think about how many different things are <unk> out .
Our <unk> here is <unk> data from the <unk> reality and our imagination .
We have <unk> , thank you to these <unk> <unk> of <unk> , able to create what we call <unk> <unk> .
We can build a big robot that can produce a big robot that can produce a million <unk> a day .
Think about <unk> these 20 million genes or to try to <unk> the <unk> to produce <unk> or <unk> , new <unk> , we can change , through a little team , and create more biology <unk> biology that we can change , with <unk> biology .
And it 's just a standard <unk> .
We can choose to <unk> , <unk> , chemistry or <unk> , <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
This is a <unk> of some software <unk> that we 're working on to be able to <unk> and design species on the computer .
Well , we don 't know how they 're going to be .
We know exactly what their code is .
We 're <unk> on the <unk> of <unk> .
You 've seen that <unk> <unk> from the <unk> was a <unk> experiment .
We have <unk> of the second generation that we had enough enough to <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> , like <unk> or different <unk> of <unk> .
But the only way that biology can have a big impact without <unk> <unk> the cost of food and <unk> would <unk> the <unk> would be <unk> in matter before , so we 're working on to <unk> cells that we 're working on to design cells that can reach this purpose , and we think we can have the first <unk> of <unk> in about 18 months .
<unk> light <unk> with CO2 is a <unk> , but in our <unk> <unk> in all of the world , we found different <unk> .
This is a <unk> that we <unk> in <unk> .
<unk> in the deep ocean , at about <unk> feet at <unk> temperature of <unk> .
<unk> <unk> from CO2 using hydrogen <unk> as <unk> as <unk> of energy .
We 're trying to understand whether we can <unk> the CO2 , which can be <unk> through <unk> , <unk> , <unk> that CO2 in <unk> , to drive this process .
So , we think we can be able to <unk> what we can do is that the <unk> of " which is what is life . " We , we <unk> the <unk> goal of <unk> industry .
<unk> . If you can 't do it from TED , where you can ?
It 's a main source of energy .
<unk> , we 're working for the same <unk> to use the same <unk> to create <unk> .
You saw this year with the flu , we 're always back a year and with a dollar in less when it comes back to find the right <unk> .
I think what you can change building <unk> <unk> in <unk> .
So , that 's how the future could start to look <unk> , the tree of evolution , <unk> evolution with bacteria bacteria <unk> , <unk> , and finally <unk> cells .
We are at so far from <unk> people .
Our purpose is to make a way of living enough to try to <unk> . Thank you very much . Thank you very much .
<unk> , I 'm going to show you , the <unk> possible , some <unk> work , a <unk> of the new technology that we took to <unk> to a <unk> <unk> a year ago .
It 's a environment that you can <unk> is <unk> to local level that <unk> with an enormous amount of data .
Here we 're seeing <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> with a kind of <unk> and <unk> , for a fast <unk> , <unk> images as we want .
And it doesn 't matter how big the amount of information that we see , how big these <unk> of data or the images .
Most of them are common photographs , but this is a <unk> <unk> by the <unk> of <unk> , and <unk> in the <unk> of <unk> , and <unk> in the <unk> of 300 <unk> .
It doesn 't make any difference because the only thing that <unk> the <unk> of a system like this is the number of <unk> on your screen at any time . It 's also a very <unk> architecture .
This is a whole book , example of data not images .
This is the <unk> <unk> . Every <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
So it 's just about it , and not <unk> of images , we can do something like that , to see that it 's a real <unk> of the text , not a picture .
It could be a way to read a little bit of a <unk> book .
I 'm not going to tell you .
This is a <unk> example . This is a <unk> <unk> .
Every image is the beginning of a <unk> .
And it really gives you the pleasure and the beautiful experience of read the real <unk> version of a <unk> or a <unk> , which is for nature a <unk> .
We also did something with the <unk> of this , in particular , <unk> .
We 've created a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> much higher than you use in a normal <unk> and we <unk> it in a normal <unk> and we <unk> it .
If you want to see the <unk> of this <unk> , you can see here .
Or other models , or even <unk> <unk> .
And this really <unk> some of these ideas to <unk> the <unk> of space on the screen .
And I thought this <unk> to put in the <unk> and other <unk> like that , you can 't get <unk> .
Of course , the <unk> is one of the most <unk> <unk> for this kind of technology .
And on this , I don 't want to lose time , if not to say that we have <unk> to do in this field .
These are all the <unk> in the United States <unk> over a <unk> picture .
So now I 'm going to start with something else .
This is actually in the Web . You can start to see .
It 's a project called <unk> , which <unk> two different technologies .
A <unk> is <unk> and the other is a <unk> <unk> computer , a very interesting <unk> , a student of Washington , with <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . A <unk> <unk> . A <unk> <unk> . A <unk> <unk> . A <unk> <unk> .
And it 's alive on the Web , <unk> .
You can see when we do this kind of <unk> , where we can go from a picture to another and have this kind of experience in <unk> .
But the <unk> <unk> of the images here has actually a meaning .
<unk> <unk> of the computer have <unk> these images , so that they <unk> to <unk> in which <unk> in which <unk> all <unk> <unk> to the <unk> <unk> on the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . <unk> have been <unk> . Here you see some <unk> or <unk> <unk> , and these things are all <unk> at <unk> .
I don 't know if I have time to show you some other environment .
There are a lot more <unk> .
I want to go directly to one of the <unk> of <unk> data and this <unk> from a <unk> <unk> of <unk> that we did work for the first time to show you what <unk> is really the key behind this technology , the <unk> technology , the <unk> technology , <unk> . And it 's not <unk> as <unk> as much as you look at the <unk> ,
We had to <unk> <unk> and so on .
This is a <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> images . <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> and <unk> images of <unk> , in <unk> , other <unk> and <unk> and <unk> images of <unk> and <unk> . <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> is an image that 's <unk> to this model .
So I 'm all <unk> images and they 're all <unk> to <unk> .
And it 's possible to <unk> this way .
You know , I would never thought about to work for <unk> .
It 's very <unk> <unk> this kind of <unk> here .
I think you can see that this is a lot of different <unk> : <unk> cell phones to those <unk> <unk> , a <unk> number , a <unk> number , <unk> in this environment .
And if I can , I try to <unk> those <unk> .
Many of them are <unk> , etc .
<unk> here is a series of photographs -- <unk> .
This is a <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> .
We can go from <unk> to physics of this environment .
The <unk> is that we can do things with social things . This is now <unk> data from <unk> <unk> of how to <unk> the land , from the <unk> of <unk> , and <unk> all those data together .
All those pictures become <unk> together , more than the <unk> of the parts .
You have a model of the whole thing that <unk> .
Think about this as a <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> on Earth .
It 's something that <unk> in <unk> complexity as people <unk> , and the <unk> that you <unk> to the use of them .
They 're <unk> with <unk> <unk> by other people .
If somebody comes the idea of <unk> all these <unk> <unk> the name , my picture of the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , using the <unk> of <unk> , using the photos of anyone else , and have a social experience <unk> and <unk> .
Of course , a <unk> of all this is <unk> models of every interesting part of the land , <unk> , <unk> not just by <unk> <unk> and <unk> and <unk> , but the memory .
Thank you very much .
Chris Anderson : I understand ? What 's what your software <unk> us to do is that at a certain point , in the next few years , all the photographs <unk> that anybody in the world will be <unk> <unk> ?
<unk> : Yeah . What 's doing is basically <unk> .
It 's creating <unk> , if you want , between images .
And he 's the <unk> of the images .
And the thing becomes very interesting if you think about the <unk> of information <unk> that many of these <unk> images .
As you do a <unk> of images on the Web , you <unk> a <unk> and the text on the page is a lot of information about images .
Now , what happens if that picture is going to do that picture if that picture is that picture ?
So the amount of <unk> and the amount of <unk> that <unk> is really huge . It 's a <unk> effect of the network .
CA : <unk> , it 's really incredible .
<unk> : I 'm going to give you a lot .
One of the main <unk> when you <unk> and one of the <unk> research is that we can live in the <unk> <unk> , who <unk> the past <unk> , who <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
You think that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , or that the <unk> <unk> , or that <unk> <unk> are still <unk> of <unk> , or that in <unk> , <unk> <unk> still the <unk> of <unk> , to <unk> the <unk> of <unk> , and that the idea that the world that we live in in in which is not <unk> , but it 's just a <unk> of a reality of <unk> , but it 's just a <unk> of a reality of <unk> ,
the <unk> of a particular <unk> of choices that our <unk> has done , well or <unk> , many <unk> .
And , of course , all of the <unk> <unk> .
Everybody <unk> . <unk> .
We 're <unk> to <unk> .
We have to <unk> the death of death , so we don 't <unk> and <unk> --
We all have an art .
What <unk> is the <unk> of the song , the <unk> of <unk> of every culture .
It doesn 't matter that they 're <unk> <unk> , or <unk> <unk> of <unk> , or <unk> <unk> <unk> , or <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> , the <unk> of <unk> , or a <unk> in the <unk> of <unk> .
He was my <unk> of journey in <unk> a month ago , or a <unk> of <unk> in the <unk> of <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> mother 's <unk> .
All of these <unk> <unk> that there are other ways of <unk> other ways to think , other ways to move in the world .
And , if you <unk> a moment , it 's a concept that can give you hope .
<unk> , <unk> of <unk> of the world create a <unk> of <unk> life and <unk> that <unk> the planet and it 's important for the <unk> of the planet as <unk> <unk> as a <unk> <unk> .
And you can think about this <unk> <unk> as a <unk> and you can <unk> the <unk> of all the <unk> , dreams , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> in being by human imagination of <unk> .
<unk> is the <unk> of humanity .
It 's the <unk> of what we are and what we can be as as <unk> species .
And <unk> the <unk> has been <unk> <unk> <unk> has happened to <unk> and <unk> much <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , for example , <unk> , <unk> that 50 percent of all the species has been or is on the <unk> of <unk> , because it 's <unk> , or -- in the <unk> of diversity -- and you don 't even even even <unk> to the <unk> <unk> -- that <unk> diversity .
<unk> of all that is , of course , the <unk> <unk> .
When you 're <unk> <unk> <unk> on this planet .
A language is not just <unk> by a <unk> or a series of <unk> rules .
A language is the <unk> of the human spirit .
It 's the middle with which the <unk> of every culture comes in the world .
Every language is a forest of the mind , a <unk> , a <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
And those <unk> <unk> , as we 're sitting in <unk> , at least half the <unk> is no longer <unk> in the <unk> of children .
They 're not going to <unk> to children , which means , unless you do something that they 're dead .
What 's more <unk> than being <unk> by <unk> , of being <unk> by <unk> , the last to talk about a language , of <unk> , not to <unk> the <unk> of <unk> or <unk> the <unk> of <unk> ?
This <unk> <unk> was the state of someone in the world every two weeks , a <unk> <unk> and door with it in the <unk> <unk> the <unk> of a <unk> .
And I know that somebody of you know , " I don 't do that ?
The world doesn 't be a better place if we all do the same language ? " So , then we all talk about it . <unk> .
<unk> <unk> .
<unk> of a <unk> , what it means not to be able to talk about their language .
I 'd like to give you a journey through the <unk> --
a little journey in <unk> to give you a <unk> of what we 're <unk> .
Many of us <unk> that when I say " different ways of <unk> . " I mean , " I mean , very different ways of <unk> .
<unk> for example this <unk> <unk> , in <unk> <unk> , the <unk> of <unk> , which <unk> to <unk> <unk> from the <unk> of <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> <unk> .
It 's a <unk> that 's not able to <unk> the blue color of the green because the time <unk> is <unk> in the forest time of the forest , which <unk> the <unk> .
They have a <unk> language and a <unk> rule , <unk> , <unk> , " <unk> , " <unk> , " you have to <unk> a different language .
And all of this has <unk> in the past <unk> , but the <unk> is that in these <unk> families in which they talk six or seven <unk> because of <unk> <unk> <unk> .
You <unk> to listen and then you start to talk about .
<unk> one of the most interesting <unk> that I lived , the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , an incredible <unk> that had the first <unk> in <unk> .
In <unk> , five <unk> have <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> .
They did <unk> by the <unk> <unk> , <unk> them in <unk> <unk> , <unk> that this <unk> of the <unk> forest had never seen anything about <unk> .
They <unk> the picture of land , they <unk> to <unk> a form or a <unk> , and they didn 't <unk> , nothing , they <unk> that <unk> <unk> , and they <unk> the five <unk> with <unk> .
But <unk> not only <unk> .
They <unk> them .
<unk> percent of the death death was <unk> by themselves .
We 've <unk> to eight <unk> and we found two <unk> of death and when we <unk> to know , they <unk> that one of them was so <unk> that he died , and then they <unk> it . <unk> the same . [ <unk> ] [ <unk> ] . ] <unk> , they had a incredible knowledge of the forest .
<unk> were able to recognize the animal <unk> by 40 <unk> and <unk> the species .
<unk> , I was <unk> , I was <unk> a very interesting job when my <unk> <unk> <unk> me if I wanted to go to <unk> between society <unk> <unk> to society 's <unk> and <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to <unk> the <unk> .
To give a sense of <unk> , I would have to understand the <unk> culture and that <unk> is not <unk> .
It 's quite a lot of a <unk> <unk> view of the world .
Very interesting .
If you <unk> the <unk> of <unk> the world , what would you know ?
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , etc .
A continent comes out , thinking that <unk> Africa doesn 't have <unk> <unk> . And instead and the <unk> is not another that the <unk> of these <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
What makes the <unk> is the <unk> of life and death .
So <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> can be <unk> by the <unk> <unk> , <unk> to the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> , so that for a short moment , the <unk> becomes the <unk> .
So the <unk> <unk> to say , " <unk> <unk> go to <unk> to talk about God .
We <unk> in <unk> and <unk> God . "
And from the moment that you 're <unk> , is the spirit that <unk> you can get you <unk> ?
So , you <unk> to these incredible events : <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a very <unk> of power of mind when it 's <unk> in a state of <unk> <unk> .
<unk> all of the <unk> with which I 've lived the most <unk> <unk> are the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , in <unk> <unk> .
<unk> of <unk> civilization that once <unk> on the <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> on the <unk> <unk> .
In a continent <unk> of blood , this <unk> never been <unk> by <unk> .
<unk> today are <unk> by a <unk> , but their <unk> is extraordinary .
<unk> <unk> are <unk> by the families to three or four years , and they live <unk> in a world <unk> and <unk> in <unk> <unk> <unk> to the <unk> <unk> for 18 years .
Two <unk> of nine years <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of mother , I 'm <unk> in the <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
And for this time , they 're <unk> to values that their society , values that they <unk> and only their <unk> <unk> and their <unk> <unk> -- or to say the <unk> <unk> .
And then then , at the <unk> <unk> , they 're <unk> <unk> out and for the first time in their life , at the age of 18 , see an <unk> . And in that moment of the first <unk> , when the <unk> <unk> <unk> , all they have learned in theory is <unk> in all the <unk> of <unk> , all the <unk> is <unk> . <unk> does a <unk> , <unk> says ,
" <unk> ? I 'm going to tell you how I said .
It 's <unk> . Now it 's <unk> . "
They call them <unk> and they say that , <unk> <unk> , we are the <unk> of the <unk> of the world .
This level is extremely important .
When we think about <unk> and the <unk> <unk> and the <unk> <unk> <unk> , which is a <unk> concept in his <unk> or maybe <unk> <unk> and say that these <unk> are closer to the Earth .
<unk> <unk> are not <unk> or <unk> by <unk> .
There is no space for these things in the <unk> <unk> of <unk> or in <unk> <unk> , but thank you for time and <unk> , they have created a <unk> of Earth <unk> not on <unk> <unk> , but on a <unk> <unk> . But in a <unk> <unk> -- the concept that the Earth can live only because it 's <unk> by human consciousness .
What does it mean ?
<unk> to say that a <unk> of the <unk> that <unk> <unk> that the mountain is a <unk> of <unk> that <unk> its <unk> will be a human being <unk> different and will have a <unk> of the mountain or that <unk> that a <unk> of <unk> that a mountain of <unk> that a <unk> <unk> to be <unk> .
which is a <unk> of a spirit or a <unk> <unk> is <unk> .
What 's interesting is the <unk> that <unk> the relationship between <unk> and the natural world .
I grew up in the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> to be <unk> .
That has made me a human being different from my friends who believe that <unk> are the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> that live in the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
If you can <unk> that these <unk> can create a different <unk> , we start to understand some of them <unk> . We 're going to <unk> this <unk> .
I <unk> this picture in <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> .
Maybe some of you 've heard about the <unk> , the most powerful <unk> of the <unk> <unk> .
What makes the <unk> is not the <unk> potential of <unk> , but his <unk> . It 's <unk> by two elements .
On one side , this <unk> <unk> that has a series of <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , <unk> .
<unk> the only <unk> you have a <unk> <unk> that <unk> a little bit of the <unk> , but it 's <unk> with the <unk> of a <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
This <unk> <unk> <unk> , very similar to <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
If you see the <unk> <unk> on the <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> the <unk> that they 're doing from a different <unk> of species , it <unk> .
<unk> that <unk> on the <unk> is a little bit like to be <unk> by a <unk> <unk> of <unk> and <unk> on a sea of electricity . <unk> <unk> . <unk> 't create a <unk> of the reality .
<unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , Richard <unk> <unk> , the man who <unk> was <unk> , with his discovery of <unk> <unk> in the <unk> .
<unk> my <unk> can 't <unk> these <unk> as <unk> because if you 're done not <unk> . <unk> <unk> , but you can 't tell anybody to be <unk> . [ <unk> ] <unk> , but <unk> can 't be <unk> because they 're <unk> by a <unk> that is <unk> by a <unk> that 's <unk> , <unk> .
It 's possible to <unk> <unk> only if you can <unk> with other <unk> <unk> that <unk> .
Now , the <unk> is the <unk> that are in this <unk> are <unk> of <unk> , the same kind of <unk> to <unk> the same kind of <unk> to <unk> the <unk> . The question <unk> <unk> : in a <unk> of <unk> species of plants , like these <unk> to <unk> two <unk> not like that , but if you <unk> in this way , they create a <unk> version of the parts ?
We use the great <unk> of <unk> and <unk> , which can <unk> <unk> .
But if you go to the <unk> , we 'll <unk> " The plants talk about it . "
What does it mean ?
This <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , which <unk> <unk> in the forest , and our eyes <unk> in the forest same species .
If you look at it as they <unk> their <unk> , " <unk> <unk> , " <unk> <unk> , " I said , " No . "
The solution is : you take the <unk> <unk> in a night of the moon and <unk> with a different <unk> .
With this not <unk> to <unk> , but it 's much more interesting than <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Now , [ <unk> ] the problem is that even those of us who have to heart <unk> <unk> them , but in some way that <unk> to the <unk> of history than our real world , and <unk> beyond .
In fact , the <unk> century , in 300 years , not <unk> <unk> for his <unk> or his <unk> <unk> , but rather like was where we <unk> and we <unk> and <unk> or <unk> <unk> the <unk> of diversity and <unk> and <unk> on the planet . Now , the problem is not the problem .
All the <unk> through the <unk> have been <unk> in a <unk> for new possibilities .
And the problem is not technology .
<unk> <unk> have no <unk> to be <unk> when they put <unk> <unk> and <unk> like how the <unk> have no <unk> to be <unk> when they put <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
It 's not the change or technology that <unk> the <unk> of <unk> . It 's power .
The <unk> <unk> of <unk> .
And if you look at a world , you 'll see that these are not <unk> to <unk> .
They 're <unk> creatures and <unk> <unk> out of the <unk> forces that go beyond their <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> --
a <unk> <unk> of <unk> , <unk> , a <unk> <unk> , a <unk> that <unk> in the forest to a generation ago , and now <unk> to the <unk> and <unk> on the <unk> of <unk> , where you can see the <unk> <unk> from the <unk> that seems to <unk> on the <unk> <unk> <unk> , where the <unk> <unk> <unk> , where the <unk> <unk> <unk> , where the <unk> <unk> <unk> ,
We start <unk> the <unk> with the <unk> <unk> to the forest .
Or , in the case of <unk> , are the diseases that are <unk> with the discovery of <unk> .
If you <unk> on the <unk> of the <unk> , where I 'm doing a lot of research , you 'll see the <unk> of politics .
As <unk> <unk> , <unk> physics of a <unk> , is <unk> to <unk> , but <unk> , <unk> <unk> , but <unk> , <unk> , <unk> of <unk> <unk> of <unk> , because it 's <unk> in certain <unk> , because it 's <unk> in certain <unk> , because it 's <unk> <unk> in <unk> , because it 's <unk> <unk> of development .
And you can 't understand the <unk> of the <unk> until you get from the beginning .
I <unk> miles from <unk> in China through the <unk> <unk> , <unk> to <unk> with a young <unk> , but only come to <unk> with a young <unk> , but only come to <unk> that <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> million people <unk> from the <unk> during the <unk> <unk> .
The father of this guy was <unk> to <unk> <unk> .
which means that it was <unk> to the Chinese days of Chinese .
<unk> <unk> is <unk> with <unk> <unk> during the <unk> that brought the <unk> in <unk> .
My mother was <unk> and his <unk> was <unk> .
It was brought to <unk> in <unk> at the age of two years <unk> <unk> his <unk> because he couldn 't have no one of him .
<unk> , who did the same , was <unk> in <unk> .
One day he <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> and , for this <unk> , was <unk> to <unk> <unk> for seven years .
<unk> of the <unk> can be <unk> , but the <unk> <unk> of <unk> is from <unk> present .
And at the end , all , you <unk> to a choice .
Do you live in the <unk> world , or we want to <unk> the <unk> world of diversity ?
The great <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , before he died said that his greatest fear was that , in our go to this <unk> view of the world , not only <unk> the whole <unk> of human imagination to a <unk> <unk> of human imagination to a <unk> <unk> of human imagination to a <unk> <unk> <unk> that there were other possibilities .
And it 's <unk> to remember that our species is <unk> for <unk> years .
The <unk> <unk> , which has given us to <unk> , that he <unk> us to <unk> <unk> , <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> with <unk> of <unk> , creating the <unk> of <unk> , and we talk about <unk> years ago .
The <unk> world has to <unk> 300 years .
That <unk> story , I didn 't know that we have the answers to all the challenges that we can <unk> in <unk> to come .
When these <unk> of <unk> of the world 's <unk> , what it means to be human , <unk> with <unk> different <unk> .
And it 's in these answers that we all <unk> the possibilities of being what we are : kind of a <unk> , which has to make that all <unk> and all the <unk> can <unk> . And there are great moments of <unk> .
I <unk> this picture on the <unk> <unk> of <unk> , when I went to <unk> <unk> with <unk> , and this man , <unk> , <unk> , he <unk> me the wonderful story of his <unk> .
The government <unk> was not always <unk> with the <unk> <unk> and in the <unk> for <unk> our <unk> , we <unk> them in <unk> .
The <unk> of this man <unk> <unk> .
<unk> , <unk> for his life , <unk> , <unk> <unk> all of his <unk> , and all his <unk> .
You know that <unk> don 't <unk> the cold , <unk> .
The <unk> of <unk> were made of <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> of this man didn 't <unk> by night or <unk> .
It 's <unk> away , you <unk> the <unk> <unk> in the <unk> . And I <unk> it up in your hand . When I did it <unk> , he <unk> it <unk> it , he <unk> it <unk> it .
He <unk> <unk> on the <unk> of this <unk> <unk> of <unk> and when <unk> <unk> , he <unk> a dog .
He <unk> the dog and created a <unk> , with the <unk> <unk> has created a <unk> , has created a <unk> , has <unk> , and it <unk> on <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
What 's going to talk about <unk> ? [ <unk> ] And this , in different ways , [ <unk> ] is the <unk> of <unk> <unk> and all the <unk> <unk> of the world .
<unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> government <unk> to <unk> the <unk> <unk> control of an area of the greatest <unk> of California and <unk> <unk> .
It 's their new <unk> . It 's called <unk> .
It 's a <unk> <unk> . <unk> all the <unk> resources .
One <unk> of how a <unk> can <unk> with his <unk> .
And , finally , I think it 's pretty <unk> at least who 's been in these <unk> <unk> of the planet , that <unk> that are not <unk> at all .
For someone is home .
<unk> <unk> of the human imagination that <unk> to <unk> . And for us , the dreams of these children , like dreams of our children , they become part of the <unk> <unk> of <unk> .
<unk> , we <unk> <unk> we <unk> we <unk> <unk> we <unk> that <unk> never <unk> .
I would say <unk> --
[ <unk> ] they 're not <unk> , but we believe that stories can change the world , and maybe we are the best <unk> to tell the stories of the world . Every month our website <unk> <unk> million <unk> .
<unk> <unk> our <unk> <unk> .
Our <unk> are <unk> by millions of people .
Our work is <unk> in <unk> to bring our audience in <unk> to bring our audience in <unk> <unk> , which <unk> away from which <unk> , and they <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , the <unk> world of <unk> : the <unk> world of <unk> , and we have to find a <unk> of life in <unk> world .
where we <unk> to all <unk> can <unk> to our <unk> <unk> .
Thank you .
I 'm going to talk about some things I wrote in this book that I hope <unk> other you heard and <unk> a few <unk> , in the case , you don 't <unk> them .
I want to start with what I call the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> of what ?
The <unk> of all society <unk> <unk> . The <unk> <unk> <unk> : " If we want to <unk> our citizens . " The way to do it is <unk> the <unk> freedom to do it is <unk> freedom . "
The reason is , on the side , in fact that the freedom is in itself , it 's <unk> , <unk> , <unk> for humans .
<unk> is that if we 're <unk> , each of us can do to do everything that we do to do that to do everything that <unk> our <unk> , without no one that <unk> in our <unk> .
The way to <unk> the freedom is to <unk> choice .
More choices people have , more <unk> , and more <unk> , and more is their <unk> , the <unk> is their <unk> .
This , <unk> , it 's so <unk> <unk> in society that no one <unk> <unk> in <unk> .
And it 's also <unk> <unk> in our lives .
I 'm going to show you some examples of what progress has made possible .
This is my <unk> . It 's not particularly big .
I <unk> a simple note on the <unk> to <unk> .
In my <unk> , there are <unk> <unk> , without <unk> the <unk> <unk> of <unk> and the <unk> <unk> that you can buy for a huge number of <unk> in <unk> <unk> that no one of the <unk> <unk> in <unk> that no one of the <unk> <unk> is <unk> .
Here 's what the <unk> is what <unk> is .
Then you go to the <unk> store to buy a <unk> : <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , radio , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
And in this single <unk> store , there 's a great number of <unk> <unk> .
We can do six and a half million different <unk> using the <unk> that there are in one store .
<unk> <unk> that there is <unk> choice .
<unk> <unk> : the world of <unk> .
Once , when I was a child , you could get all the services <unk> , <unk> that were <unk> by <unk> <unk> .
You <unk> the phone , you don 't get it .
A <unk> of that , between the other , was that the phone never <unk> .
These days they went .
We have a <unk> <unk> of <unk> , especially in <unk> phones .
Here 's the cell cell phones .
My <unk> is in the middle , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , and <unk> to <unk> <unk> .
If you haven 't seen it in the store under the house , you 're very <unk> that soon <unk> .
And what 's the end of what happens is that people go into <unk> and does this question . And you know , what 's the answer is " No . "
It 's not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn 't do it .
So , in other <unk> of life that are much more important than <unk> , you <unk> the same <unk> of choices .
<unk> <unk> : It doesn 't work more in the United States that you 're <unk> from <unk> and the <unk> you will <unk> what you do .
Instead , <unk> from <unk> , and the <unk> says , " Okay , we can do it . Or you can do it , or <unk> , " <unk> " <unk> has these <unk> and <unk> " <unk> . " What do you want to do ? "
You ask him , " What do you do it ? "
And the <unk> says , " <unk> , he 's got these <unk> and these <unk> , and <unk> has these <unk> and <unk> . "
" What do you do ? "
And you say , " <unk> if she was me , what would you say ? "
And the <unk> , " But I 'm not her . "
The result we call it " <unk> " <unk> " , " <unk> " <unk> " , " <unk> .
But actually , it 's not a <unk> of <unk> and <unk> to make decisions from someone who knows something , <unk> the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> the <unk> , to <unk> , and almost certainly is <unk> -- and so that it 's not <unk> to take a <unk> , and so not in <unk> to take decisions to take the patient 's decisions .
There 's a huge <unk> of <unk> products , <unk> to people like me and you , that if you think about it has no sense , because we can 't <unk> .
But if we can 't <unk> , why do we <unk> them ?
The answer is they want to <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> of that as a <unk> is our <unk> now is a question of choice , as you see in this <unk> . " We don 't want to <unk> children . <unk> their <unk> at the <unk> . " We have to <unk> .
And we can <unk> how many times we <unk> .
which means that every <unk> , to <unk> , you have to decide that kind of person , you have to decide that kind of person .
<unk> to the family and <unk> , a <unk> time , <unk> <unk> , almost to anyone who was that , you <unk> the <unk> as possible , and you can get kids to the <unk> as soon as possible .
The only true choice was with who , not when , and I don 't even do it after .
<unk> , all is really to play .
They were to <unk> very smart , and they <unk> them 20 percent less work than a time .
And not because they 're less <unk> , not because they 're less <unk> .
But why are I <unk> , <unk> to <unk> , " <unk> or not ? "
" <unk> <unk> <unk> later ? I have to think about the children or the career ? "
They 're <unk> <unk> .
And they try to <unk> these questions , even if this <unk> doesn 't <unk> the <unk> that <unk> and not to get a <unk> <unk> .
And they really have to do it . They 're important questions .
Now , the job : we 're <unk> , as <unk> <unk> , because technology technology technology <unk> us to work every day , every day , from every <unk> of the planet , <unk> that from the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , there is a <unk> , and I 'm not going to say , where the <unk> works .
I don 't tell you , because I want to use it .
What does , this incredible freedom of choice that we have about this work ? Is it we have to <unk> , <unk> at every moment , if we have to work or not .
We can go to see our son to <unk> , with the phone in a <unk> , the other , and the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , on <unk> .
And even though I 'm all <unk> , every minute we see our son <unk> , <unk> , we 're also <unk> , " I have to <unk> it ? "
" I have to <unk> this <unk> ? I have to <unk> this <unk> ? "
And even when the answer is , " no , that makes the experience of your son very different than what would be in other conditions .
So , from any <unk> , we look at , and the <unk> of life , life is a question of choices .
Once the world was this : <unk> , there were some possibilities , but it was not a question of choice .
The world of today , I 'm going to this : The <unk> is , " Is it a <unk> , or <unk> ? "
The answer is <unk> .
<unk> <unk> them all of this , so I 'm going to talk about the <unk> .
<unk> this choice <unk> two effects of people .
The first , <unk> , is that it <unk> instead of <unk> .
With a lot of <unk> of which you choose , it becomes very hard to do it .
I 'll give you a <unk> example : a study <unk> on <unk> <unk> .
A <unk> has been access to the <unk> data , <unk> society 's <unk> , with about a million <unk> in different <unk> .
What she discovered is that for every 10 solutions that are <unk> in more , the <unk> of <unk> <unk> 2 percent .
With 50 <unk> <unk> , there 's 10 percent less than <unk> when they 're available to them . Why ?
Because with 50 <unk> that you have to choose , it 's hard to decide , and the choice is <unk> to <unk> .
And in <unk> , and again , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and of course , <unk> never comes .
<unk> that doesn 't mean just that these <unk> <unk> <unk> food to <unk> because they don 't have enough money , it also also also to say that the decision is so <unk> that we also <unk> the <unk> <unk> of work .
They 're not <unk> , they 're <unk> to five <unk> <unk> per year from <unk> of work , that would be <unk> to <unk> .
So the <unk> is a <unk> of having <unk> choices .
And I think it <unk> the world like this .
" And to <unk> : <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> or <unk> ? "
You really have to take the right decision , if it 's to <unk> , right ?
You don 't want to choose the wrong , and you <unk> the wrong <unk> .
So this is the first effect . The second is that even if we can <unk> <unk> and make a choice , at the end of how to <unk> <unk> and make choice , at the end of how to <unk> .
And that 's for a few reasons .
One of these is that with a lot of <unk> in which you choose , and it 's not perfect , it 's easy to imagine that we could do a different choice that would be better . And what happens is that <unk> <unk> <unk> us to <unk> choice , and the <unk> <unk> of choice , and the <unk> <unk> the <unk> of <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> of the decision ,
even when it was a <unk> decision .
More choices , there are , more choices to <unk> than any <unk> that <unk> is <unk> of <unk> choice .
<unk> , there is what <unk> call .
Dan <unk> has <unk> very well as the value that we give things to <unk> things from what <unk> <unk> .
<unk> rest , when you have a lot of <unk> , it 's easy to <unk> the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> to be less <unk> of the <unk> that you have choice .
Here 's an example . I 'm <unk> with all the people that are not in New York .
But that 's what you probably <unk> .
There 's this <unk> to <unk> .
A place of <unk> .
<unk> <unk> . <unk> day . It 's all about them .
It 's nothing . But what he thinks is , " Well , <unk> , <unk> , it 's <unk> . "
" All my <unk> are <unk> . "
" <unk> <unk> right in front of the house . "
And it <unk> two weeks that 's going to <unk> -- every day -- the chance of <unk> where it wants .
The <unk> <unk> for what we have , even when the choice was <unk> .
And the <unk> are the <unk> we have from <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Here 's another example .
This <unk> tells us a lot of things .
It 's about a moment , and maybe a living <unk> .
But the most important point is that anything you <unk> , you know , you 're going to <unk> .
The things that don 't have a lot of <unk> that can make less <unk> what we do .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> of <unk> .
I tried it on my skin <unk> a new couple of <unk> .
<unk> always <unk> .
Once the <unk> were only <unk> , <unk> them and <unk> <unk> , were <unk> , only after <unk> , were <unk> , only after <unk> a life and <unk> a lot of times , they were going to go well .
So , I went to <unk> a new couple when the <unk> were gone , and I said , " I need a couple of <unk> , this is my <unk> . "
And the <unk> said , " You want to <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> ? "
You want them to <unk> or with <unk> ? " <unk> " <unk> " or " <unk> " ? "
" You want to <unk> ? "
" <unk> wants to <unk> or <unk> ? <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> -- " <unk> to <unk> .
I was <unk> , and after a little bit I was able to say , " I want the guy that was the only guy , " I had no idea of what was , so for a <unk> now , <unk> , <unk> , and then <unk> by the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , with the best <unk> I had ever had .
It was the <unk> . With all that choice , I had <unk> the best .
But I 'm worse .
Why ? I wrote a whole book for <unk> .
The reason I was worse is that with all the choice was <unk> , the <unk> <unk> to be <unk> .
I had <unk> <unk> . I didn 't <unk> anything <unk> when I just <unk> a guy , but when I just <unk> 100 different , <unk> , at least one guy had to be perfect .
What I had <unk> was good , but not perfect .
After I <unk> that I <unk> with what I was <unk> in <unk> .
The <unk> of <unk> in the life of people don 't do <unk> the <unk> that these have <unk> to the same <unk> .
And this <unk> less <unk> , even when the results are good .
<unk> in the world of <unk> if you get it .
Because if you <unk> it , I don 't know what I 'm talking about .
The truth is more to this .
" It was better when you was worse , " The reason he was <unk> when you know it was worse is when it was worse is that when it was worse was even worse as you can see <unk> <unk> .
<unk> , in the world that we live -- <unk> , <unk> citizens with the <unk> of <unk> -- the <unk> that we can <unk> is that things are at the <unk> of <unk> .
You never <unk> <unk> because your <unk> , my <unk> , you 're <unk> .
The <unk> of happiness -- what you 're here -- is , " <unk> <unk> " Yes , you want to . "
I mean -- little <unk> moment -- which I 'm really <unk> and my wife is really <unk> .
I couldn 't do better , I didn 't <unk> .
But <unk> is not always a <unk> thing .
<unk> , a <unk> of buy a couple of <unk> <unk> when there is only that kind of <unk> is that when you 're not <unk> , and I 'm going to you , " Why ? "
" Who is <unk> ? " <unk> is <unk> .
The world is <unk> . What I could you do it ?
When you have hundreds of <unk> , and you <unk> a <unk> , and you <unk> a <unk> , and you 'll <unk> you who is the <unk> , it 's <unk> clear that the <unk> you 're you .
We could do better .
With hundreds of <unk> available , there are no <unk> for <unk> .
So when people make decisions , even if the <unk> is <unk> , they <unk> and they give them them their own .
In the last few years , the <unk> is <unk> in the <unk> world .
I think a <unk> <unk> -- not the only , but important -- of this <unk> of <unk> is just that people have <unk> experiences because the <unk> are too <unk> .
And when they have to <unk> this think that <unk> is them .
So the final result is that in general we 're better , but we 'll get worse .
Let me <unk> you .
This is the <unk> <unk> , what we all take for good and it 's completely <unk> . It 's not true .
There is no <unk> that a little bit of choice is better than <unk> at all , but this doesn 't <unk> that much choice is better than a little bit .
There 's a <unk> , <unk> . I don 't know what it 's .
But I 'm quite sure we 've <unk> from a piece of a piece of the level that we <unk> our life .
Now , from the <unk> <unk> -- I almost finished -- from the <unk> of <unk> , the <unk> is the <unk> .
What it allows all this choice in society is the <unk> material .
There are a lot of places in the world , and you know , <unk> <unk> , where the problem is not that they have <unk> choice .
The problem is they have too much <unk> .
So the <unk> I 'm talking about is a <unk> <unk> of <unk> , <unk> society .
And what <unk> does <unk> and <unk> is this : <unk> <unk> <unk> you yesterday about how those <unk> and <unk> <unk> to <unk> are <unk> . It 's a <unk> of money . It 's a <unk> of money .
I mean that these choices , <unk> and <unk> , it 's not just <unk> .
They 're <unk> <unk> .
They do worse .
If you know what in our society allows choice to be <unk> in those where people have too few people , it would not only be their life to <unk> but also our own life .
This is what <unk> call a <unk> <unk> .
A <unk> of income does well , not just the poor -- because of this choice in <unk> that <unk> us .
And to <unk> : " <unk> , you can become everything you want to do --
<unk> , people of culture , <unk> , " What 's you know that fish ? "
" It 's <unk> that you can 't do anything in a glass <unk> . "
" A <unk> , a <unk> <unk> , a <unk> view of the world --
and I <unk> it so , at the beginning .
But then , <unk> , instead , I made that that fish knows that that fish knows that fish knows .
Because the reality of <unk> is that if you <unk> the <unk> , in the way that " everything is possible . " You don 't <unk> the freedom . You <unk> the <unk> .
If you <unk> the <unk> in a way that everything you can <unk> the <unk> .
<unk> the <unk> , and <unk> the <unk> .
Everybody needs a <unk> .
This is almost certainly too <unk> , maybe even for the fish , and certainly for us .
But the <unk> of some <unk> is a <unk> for <unk> and , <unk> , <unk> , for <unk> .
Thank you very much of the heart .
