<unk> year I showed these <unk> <unk> that the <unk> <unk> <unk> , which for almost three million years , it has had the size of the United States <unk> , <unk> <unk> , 40 percent <unk> .
So , this <unk> the problem because it doesn 't show the ice <unk> .
<unk> <unk> is , in a way , the heart <unk> of climate system .
It <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
The next <unk> will be a <unk> <unk> on the <unk> of the last 25 years .
<unk> <unk> are <unk> in red .
You see , you know , it 's <unk> up to the blue <unk> .
That 's the ice in <unk> , which is <unk> in summer .
You can see that the <unk> ice <unk> , of five years or more , is like blood , that here <unk> from the body .
In 25 years , it 's been <unk> , in 25 years .
This is a problem because the <unk> are interested in the <unk> <unk> of the ocean around the <unk> where there are huge <unk> of <unk> that , <unk> are <unk> by <unk> .
<unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> , that <unk> <unk> could <unk> , that <unk> <unk> , <unk> this point .
In some <unk> , you know , you 're going to <unk> the water .
The <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> ! <unk> : You 're doing good . The question is if you do it .
A reason is that this <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> from the north .
This is a <unk> river in <unk> .
It had never <unk> <unk> .
This is the <unk> river in the <unk> of <unk> .
If you want to know how the <unk> <unk> <unk> to the sea level to <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> , here is where the sea .
These <unk> are <unk> .
On the other part of the planet : <unk> , the biggest <unk> of ice on the planet .
The last month , the scientists have <unk> that the ice <unk> is in <unk> , and that the <unk> <unk> , which <unk> on some <unk> <unk> , is particularly <unk> in <unk> .
<unk> at six feet of the <unk> , as <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , the third largest <unk> of ice , you see new <unk> , which a few years ago were <unk> .
40 percent of the world 's population <unk> water from that <unk> .
<unk> <unk> : this <unk> is the source of water <unk> this city .
<unk> is <unk> .
But when you <unk> , the same happens to the water .
In California , <unk> , <unk> <unk> is <unk> of 40 percent .
The <unk> are in crisis .
The <unk> , as you read , are <unk> .
<unk> <unk> in the world <unk> <unk> to a <unk> increase in the world .
The <unk> are <unk> a <unk> outside the normal and without <unk> .
<unk> times more <unk> in the last 30 years of <unk> .
This is a <unk> of all <unk> .
If you look in the context context , you can see the <unk> .
In the last five years , we have <unk> 70 million <unk> of CO2 every 24 hours -- 25 million <unk> in the oceans every day .
Look at <unk> the area of the <unk> <unk> , from <unk> , and on both parts of the <unk> <unk> , where there 's a <unk> <unk> of oxygen in the oceans .
The biggest cause of global warming , together , which is 20 percent , is the use of <unk> <unk> .
The oil is a problem , and the <unk> is even worse .
The United States is one of the two countries with <unk> emissions , together .
And it 's <unk> to build a lot of other <unk> <unk> .
But we 're starting to a <unk> of direction .
These are the <unk> projects over the last few years and some <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
<unk> , there is a politics in our country .
The <unk> of <unk> and oil <unk> have <unk> million dollars in the last year to <unk> <unk> , which is a <unk> .
I 'm going to <unk> me something --
<unk> <unk> , in <unk> , where I live , there was a <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
You may have seen it on the <unk> .
This is the second biggest flow of <unk> in America .
It 's happened around <unk> .
<unk> <unk> of one of the <unk> <unk> was this .
<unk> : <unk> â™« <unk> is a <unk> and happy guy .
It 's <unk> here in America , and it makes our economy .
<unk> the <unk> is <unk> .
It 's <unk> , <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> it .
Al <unk> : From here , it 's a lot of <unk> <unk> .
The biggest <unk> society on the <unk> is <unk> <unk> . This is his <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> , <unk> -- <unk> -- <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> -- don 't know what they 're talking about .
<unk> : So the <unk> for the <unk> of <unk> has <unk> two <unk> .
This is one of them , one part .
<unk> : <unk> : <unk> we see the <unk> changes as a <unk> <unk> in our business .
So that 's what our <unk> is <unk> a big amount of money in a <unk> <unk> to make public and <unk> the truth of <unk> .
In fact , <unk> is not <unk> .
We think it 's <unk> -- it 's also good <unk> .
So we don 't know about climate change .
We need to do it .
<unk> : <unk> -- you heard -- you heard -- you heard a lot of talk about it .
So , you know , a <unk> structure of <unk> as much as <unk> is about <unk> .
<unk> ! The machines are a little bit <unk> , but that 's the sound of <unk> technology .
<unk> <unk> is between the main <unk> of global <unk> , but the <unk> technology <unk> that you see everything .
Let 's look : this is the <unk> technology .
<unk> : <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to the economic issue and the national security .
<unk> : <unk> America is in crisis ; the economy , the national security , the national crisis .
The <unk> that <unk> all : our <unk> <unk> <unk> , like <unk> and oil <unk> .
But now , there 's a new <unk> , <unk> solution to <unk> it .
<unk> America : 100 percent of <unk> energy , in 10 years .
A plan for <unk> America at work , <unk> , and help <unk> , and help <unk> global <unk> .
<unk> , a solution that we 're going to solve our problems .
<unk> America . <unk> more .
Al <unk> : This is the last .
<unk> : It 's about <unk> energy to America .
One of the most <unk> ways of <unk> to <unk> from the <unk> that <unk> our planet .
<unk> : The future is here . <unk> , <unk> , a new network .
<unk> <unk> two : <unk> <unk> jobs .
<unk> : <unk> America . It 's time to be <unk> .
<unk> : A old <unk> <unk> says , " If you want to go , you go for yourself .
If you want to go , you go together . "
We have to go away , quickly .
Thank you very much .
<unk> year at TED , I did a <unk> on <unk> .
And they 're going to <unk> it to <unk> how the machine works .
So here we go . And for the ones that the other time there were no , the <unk> is the biggest scientific experiment that was ever <unk> -- <unk> miles of an hour .
His task is to <unk> the conditions that were in less than a <unk> of the <unk> of the universe -- until <unk> million times a second .
All of that is simply <unk> .
This is the machine under <unk> .
They <unk> these <unk> <unk> in the <unk> .
This is what I work . It 's called <unk> -- it 's <unk> feet and it has a <unk> <unk> .
This is a <unk> picture of <unk> in building so you can see the <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> last year we <unk> the car for the first time .
And this picture was <unk> by <unk> .
It was <unk> <unk> in control .
It 's a picture of the first <unk> of particles that had done all the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , with a part of the <unk> , and we <unk> particles in the <unk> .
In other words , when you look at that picture , you know , you know , the machine that 's a big <unk> .
I don 't know if it was this to do <unk> more or that , when someone <unk> on Google and <unk> that the <unk> page was this .
That means that we had a <unk> impact over to that scientific one .
<unk> a week later , there was a problem with the car , you had to these <unk> here -- these <unk> <unk> .
These <unk> <unk> <unk> when the machine works at the <unk> of the <unk> .
Now , the <unk> between you are <unk> , the <unk> and <unk> , " It 's not true . I 'm too <unk> . "
And they can do it because when they 're very <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
So , at least <unk> degrees , at a temperature <unk> at that of the space between stars , these <unk> can bring that <unk> .
In one of the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> in the <unk> , there was a <unk> of <unk> .
So the <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> .
This was the result .
Now this is even more <unk> if you think that these <unk> <unk> more than 20 <unk> , and that <unk> <unk> of about 30 <unk> .
They have about 50 <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , what we did .
We <unk> them and <unk> .
Now they 're all <unk> to their <unk> place .
We 're going to <unk> the <unk> is going to be new <unk> .
We <unk> it , and we <unk> to get data <unk> or <unk> , and we continue to <unk> and <unk> that our <unk> to find out what the universe is .
Now , of course , in a certain way , these <unk> <unk> <unk> the value of science and engineering engineering engineering <unk> . It 's easy to <unk> .
I think that it 's so hard , the fact that it 's so hard , the <unk> value of things like <unk> .
I want to <unk> with the words of a <unk> <unk> , <unk> , which , <unk> , in <unk> <unk> of <unk> experiments of his <unk> , his <unk> was Michael <unk> , said , " It 's not a lot of <unk> for the human mind how much <unk> that ideas are <unk> , that there are no new <unk> , that there are no new <unk> , that our <unk> are <unk> , and that there are no new <unk> by <unk> . "
Thank you .
I want to start <unk> to <unk> you to <unk> that when we children , <unk> with <unk> .
And they 're going to be <unk> and <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , actually , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> is <unk> <unk> to the way that we <unk> part of the world around us .
So , as <unk> from <unk> of our <unk> with <unk> objects , together , with my <unk> <unk> , and I started <unk> , and I started <unk> , " And if we use a computer , instead of having a computer , you have just <unk> <unk> <unk> as digital <unk> <unk> that moving on a <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk>
and do we start to our <unk> ?
The question was so interesting that we wanted to explore the answer , building the answer , building .
In a few words , a <unk> is a <unk> computer as a <unk> .
In a few words , a <unk> is a <unk> computer as a <unk> .
You can <unk> it with your hand , they can <unk> them , and they have a <unk> <unk> , and they have a <unk> <unk> ,
But <unk> , they 're <unk> , like <unk> , you can just <unk> .
The <unk> are the <unk> of a new <unk> of tools to <unk> the digital information .
And as they become more <unk> , <unk> of the <unk> , <unk> of the <unk> , of the other , and as they become more <unk> , <unk> of the <unk> , of the other , how we can <unk> new <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
Let 's start with some simple example .
This <unk> is <unk> to show you about the video : if you <unk> it in a direction , the video <unk> so , if you look at the other side back .
These <unk> are <unk> of others .
If you <unk> them , you 're <unk> to what they are around .
If they 're <unk> , and they can <unk> a little bit .
If they 're <unk> , and they can <unk> a little bit .
They also have their movement and <unk> .
We then <unk> that one of the interesting <unk> of the <unk> was the <unk> that you could use common data on the data , for example , <unk> <unk> , a color as if it was a <unk> .
In this case , we have three <unk> <unk> as a <unk> <unk> and I can <unk> to <unk> the color of <unk> , where they <unk> .
And I can <unk> it to <unk> the color of the central one , where they <unk> .
We can <unk> it , we can <unk> a little bit of a place .
There are also <unk> possibilities , like <unk> , how <unk> , and <unk> , where people can try things things , and <unk> the results immediately .
Now I 'm --
This is a <unk> sequence that I do with a <unk> program .
Here we have a words that 's in half of <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> , every <unk> <unk> a letter on every <unk> , <unk> , every <unk> , <unk> , every <unk> letter , on every <unk> , and while I was <unk> in <unk> , and while I was <unk> in the <unk> .
Then , after about 30 seconds , you get , and you have a new <unk> <unk> and <unk> to try .
Thank you .
Here 's a little <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> , I made them so that I <unk> them and I <unk> a video .
They 're very <unk> .
And one of the interesting things of these things that <unk> is that you don 't have to people many <unk> .
I just mean , " <unk> , " and they know exactly what to do .
Here are other people who <unk> it .
This is our <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , there .
It just wanted to <unk> .
They were just <unk> , for him .
Now , this is a <unk> of a <unk> <unk> .
We had to build a tool for the <unk> of the <unk> . He 's <unk> .
It can <unk> new characters in the scene , <unk> their <unk> .
It can <unk> new characters in the scene , <unk> their <unk> .
Here 's , it 's going to get the sun .
<unk> : The sun is <unk> .
David <unk> : Now he brought a <unk> in the scene .
<unk> : The <unk> <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> . <unk> ! Yes !
So <unk> the <unk> and <unk> can <unk> the characters --
<unk> : <unk> !
-- <unk> your story .
<unk> : <unk> !
<unk> : It 's a story with the open , and you can decide he as to do .
<unk> : It 's a story with the open , and you can decide he as to do .
<unk> : <unk> away , <unk> .
<unk> : The last example I have time to show you is a recent tool , <unk> <unk> , to <unk> and <unk> music .
It 's a recent tool that was recently , to <unk> and <unk> music .
The <unk> here are <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
<unk> of these have four different <unk> , and you can choose which you use .
You can also <unk> these <unk> in a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And you just <unk> a " sound and a <unk> sequence . "
These are effects that you can control live , like <unk> and <unk> .
I 'm going to <unk> it to a particular sound and then <unk> to <unk> .
And then there are the effects of time and <unk> , that <unk> the whole sequence .
<unk> how it works .
<unk> : <unk> a <unk> <unk> in two <unk> , " sequence , " <unk> , " <unk> in a series , the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> in a series
Now , you 're going to take a <unk> line .
<unk> : <unk> : Now , <unk> of <unk> --
<unk> : And now I 'm going to <unk> the <unk> to the <unk> , so I can control the effect of the live .
<unk> : I can <unk> the whole sequence , <unk> the time on one side or the other .
<unk> : And now we <unk> the <unk> to make more <unk> .
<unk> : I can <unk> the sequence of the flight of <unk> .
So I don 't have to <unk> before , but I can <unk> , <unk> , <unk> more or more <unk> .
And now , finally , I can <unk> the whole <unk> sequence on the left <unk> .
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is to build new <unk> <unk> <unk> to how our brain work and body .
And today , I 've had time to show you one of the results of this <unk> , and some possibilities that we try to bring out of the lab .
The concept I want to <unk> you is that it 's going to <unk> this new <unk> of objects to <unk> the <unk> media , that we want .
Thank you very much .
I don 't see the time of talking to you .
I 'm a <unk> .
<unk> books is my <unk> , but it 's more than that , of course .
It 's also love and the <unk> of my life .
And I don 't expect to change .
But , said that , something about this particular , it was <unk> in my life and my career , who brought me to <unk> the whole relationship with this work .
The particular thing is that I wrote this book , this <unk> called " <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
And the result is that everywhere , it 's now , people like I <unk> .
<unk> -- <unk> , <unk> !
<unk> to me now , everybody <unk> and they say , " You don 't fear of you not be able to do better ?
You don 't fear to write for the whole life without being able to create a book that could <unk> to someone ? "
" which can <unk> to someone ? "
It 's <unk> , you know .
But it could go worse , and I remember , over 20 years ago , when I was saying to people -- -- I was a <unk> -- that I wanted to be a <unk> .
I 'm going to be <unk> by fear .
And people said , " Don 't you know , you don 't know that to be successful ?
You don 't fear that the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> you ?
You don 't fear to make this <unk> for the life without anything that any of them <unk> and die on a <unk> of <unk> <unk> with the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> ?
So you know , you know .
The answer -- the short answer to all these questions is , " Yes . "
Yes , I fear of all those things .
I 've always had fear .
And I fear of a lot of other things that people don 't <unk> .
How <unk> and other things <unk> .
But , as it 's about writing what I thought and <unk> is why ?
Is it <unk> ?
It 's <unk> that anyone who would be <unk> by a job that you had to do .
But what 's so particular about the <unk> <unk> that we 're <unk> to <unk> health care in a way that other <unk> don 't do ?
My father , for instance , he was a <unk> <unk> and not remember one time in the 40 years of activity where he was asked if fear to be <unk> <unk> ?
It was never -- that <unk> of <unk> John , how do you ?
<unk> 't you that way , <unk> ?
<unk> , the engineers <unk> as a group , they certainly don 't , in <unk> , <unk> the <unk> of being <unk> .
We <unk> , we have enough this <unk> , and not only <unk> but <unk> <unk> , all of these <unk> , we have this <unk> of being <unk> <unk> .
And they don 't want to be another one that you look at the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> that , only in the <unk> century , <unk> young and often for them .
And the ones that don 't have <unk> to be really <unk> by their <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , before he died , in the last <unk> said , " Every <unk> my book <unk> me a little bit more amazing <unk> about the work of their life .
But we don 't know when you 're saying why we heard these things so long that somehow we have <unk> and <unk> the <unk> that the creativity and <unk> the <unk> that the creativity and the art , eventually <unk> always <unk> .
And the question I want to tell you all of you today is : you agree with this idea ?
It 's good for you , because you also get it from a <unk> <unk> <unk> to me .
I think it 's <unk> .
And I think it 's <unk> , and I don 't want to <unk> you in the next century .
I think it 's better <unk> our great <unk> to live .
And I certainly know that , in my case -- it would be very <unk> to start <unk> to that <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in which I 'm in my career .
<unk> -- <unk> , look , I 'm pretty young , I 'm pretty young , about 40 years .
I still have about four <unk> of work in me .
And it 's very <unk> that anything that 's going to happen to be <unk> from the world like the work that after the world 's going to work that after the <unk> of my last book .
<unk> <unk> , because we are all about <unk> , because we are all <unk> my biggest <unk> is to my <unk> .
Oh , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> !
You know this is the kind of thinking that leads a person to start <unk> <unk> on the morning and I don 't want to do it .
I want to keep going to do this work that I love .
So , the question becomes , how ?
And so it looks like , after many <unk> , that the way of working to keep it and write is to create a <unk> <unk> <unk> , OK ?
I have to find a <unk> distance of security between me , which I 'm <unk> , and my <unk> <unk> on what I would do . And as we were <unk> for the last year models of how to do it , we 're looking through the time , and we 're trying to find other society to see if you have more ideas and <unk> ideas to see if you have better ideas and <unk>
about how to help people <unk> the <unk> <unk> of creativity .
And that research has brought me to the <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
It 's because they 're going to go back and then <unk> .
You have to <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> -- people don 't believe that creativity <unk> from men , OK ?
It was <unk> that creativity was this <unk> <unk> , and that <unk> to men from some <unk> <unk> and <unk> , for reasons and <unk> .
The <unk> are these <unk> <unk> of creativity " <unk> . "
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> to have a <unk> that <unk> <unk> from <unk> .
The <unk> were the same idea , but they <unk> that kind of spirit of <unk> .
which is <unk> , because the <unk> didn 't really believe that a <unk> was a <unk> of a particularly .
I thought a <unk> was this kind of <unk> <unk> that was literally <unk> in the <unk> of a study artist , a little bit like the <unk> <unk> , and that <unk> out of <unk> the artist and <unk> the <unk> of that work .
<unk> <unk> , here 's the distance of which I talk -- that <unk> <unk> that <unk> you <unk> that <unk> you from the results of your work .
And everybody <unk> that was so <unk> , right ?
So , the artists were <unk> by <unk> things , like the too <unk> , no ?
If your job was <unk> not <unk> all the <unk> , everybody <unk> that had been <unk> by this <unk> <unk> .
If your job , you didn 't have a <unk> <unk> , right ?
Everybody <unk> that was your <unk> to being a <unk> .
And so people are <unk> the creativity of creativity , for a long time .
Then the <unk> <unk> and everything , and we <unk> this big idea ; we put the human <unk> on the center of the universe and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and the
This was the principle of <unk> <unk> and people who were thinking that creativity was completely from the <unk> .
And for the first time in history , he <unk> to <unk> this or that artist as a rather <unk> person with <unk> .
And I have to <unk> , I think that was a big <unk> .
I think that you 're going to somebody , a simple person to believe that it 's like a source , <unk> and <unk> of all the <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> and <unk> is a <unk> responsibility a <unk> to <unk> human <unk> .
It 's like asking someone to <unk> the sun .
<unk> and <unk> completely <unk> and creates all these <unk> <unk> <unk> and creates all these <unk> <unk> on the <unk> .
And I think it was this pressure to have <unk> artists in <unk> 500 years .
And if that 's true , and I think it 's , the question is , and now ?
Can we do that ?
<unk> back to a more understanding of the relationship between humans and <unk> <unk> .
Or maybe not .
We may not be <unk> 500 years of thinking in a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And there 's probably people in the audience who <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> on the <unk> , <unk> , you do , <unk> , <unk> , do that <unk> people are <unk> of <unk> on their projects .
You probably don 't tell you all this thing .
But the question I want to <unk> is -- why not ?
Why don 't you do that ?
Because it makes more sense of anything else that has ever heard about to the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> process .
A process of a process that , as anyone who ever <unk> to do something -- so , basically , everybody -- you know , you don 't <unk> .
And in fact , it can sometimes be completely <unk> .
I did this <unk> <unk> with the extraordinary <unk> <unk> , who has now 90 years , but that was a <unk> <unk> for the life and said that during his <unk> <unk> , <unk> out in the <unk> <unk> , <unk> out in the <unk> , and <unk> it , within the <unk> , and the <unk> , within the <unk> .
He said that it was like a <unk> <unk> .
And she <unk> <unk> to her from <unk> .
He <unk> it , because he did <unk> the land under its feet .
I thought I had one thing to do and that point , and it was , " <unk> like a <unk> . "
And he <unk> up to home and it was <unk> by this <unk> , and it wouldn 't have to do anything else that take a piece of paper and a <unk> enough <unk> , and <unk> on the page .
Sometimes you couldn 't get enough fast , so <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> without being able to get home and <unk> and she would <unk> her to <unk> through and she would <unk> <unk> through the <unk> , looking for , looking for the <unk> , looking for , as she said , " another <unk> . "
Then there were times -- this piece never <unk> -- there were times , there were times when the age was almost <unk> , OK ?
So , he was <unk> at home and he was looking for the paper and the <unk> it through , and he <unk> a <unk> right in the while he was <unk> , and then he said , that she was like , and then he was <unk> with the other hand and <unk> .
<unk> the tail and <unk> it in his body and the <unk> on the page .
And in these cases , the <unk> would be <unk> on the <unk> page and <unk> but the <unk> , the <unk> <unk> to the <unk> , the <unk> to the <unk> .
So when you <unk> -- it 's <unk> , it 's exactly <unk> to my <unk> process .
Not the <unk> process . I 'm not a <unk> !
I 'm a <unk> , and my way of <unk> is ; I 'm going to <unk> every day and work and work and <unk> over .
But even me in my <unk> , I <unk> against that thing , sometimes .
And I would say that many of you <unk> that .
You know , even if the job and the ideas that <unk> me from a certain source I couldn 't <unk> .
And what this is this thing ?
And how can we <unk> it in it , we don 't lose your head , but rather , what would you <unk> <unk> ?
So , as I 'm <unk> , the best example I have is the <unk> <unk> <unk> , which I <unk> different years ago for a <unk> .
You know , you 're talking about this , and you know , <unk> , for the <unk> of life was the <unk> artist <unk> , trying to control , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> these <unk> <unk> , <unk> these <unk> <unk> <unk> .
But then <unk> , he <unk> , and a day while he was <unk> on a <unk> <unk> <unk> , he <unk> it all for him .
<unk> , <unk> , and everything of a <unk> <unk> , that 's going to be <unk> , and it <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> , and you know , and you want , you , it 's wonderful , and the <unk> , but he doesn 't know how to <unk> .
It doesn 't have a piece of paper , it doesn 't have a <unk> .
So he starts to feel this kind of old <unk> to grow in him , like , " I 'm going to lose , and <unk> <unk> by this <unk> song .
I 'm not <unk> enough , and I can 't <unk> it . "
And instead of going to <unk> , they <unk> .
It <unk> the whole <unk> process and made something completely new .
He just <unk> the sky and said , " <unk> , you don 't see you that I 'm <unk> ? "
" It seems to you that a song now ?
If you really want to <unk> , you 're going to get it in a <unk> moment when I can take care of you .
<unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> . "
And his <unk> process after this .
Not the job , the work was still <unk> as always .
But the process , and the <unk> <unk> that <unk> was <unk> when he <unk> the <unk> , the <unk> that he <unk> out of him , he was <unk> , he <unk> that he was not to be a <unk> and <unk> back from where , <unk> that it was not to be a <unk> and <unk> .
but <unk> this <unk> , wonderful <unk> , <unk> a conversation between <unk> and this thing <unk> and <unk> that but it wasn 't <unk> .
So , how much <unk> that story is going to change a little bit , the way I <unk> and I and already <unk> me once .
This idea , I was <unk> when I was <unk> , " <unk> , <unk> , " and I was in one of the <unk> of the <unk> in which we 're working on something , and we don 't start thinking that it 's going to be a <unk> , that 's going to be <unk> , that what 's going to be .
Not just <unk> , right , right , right ?
And we start thinking about <unk> this project .
But then I 'm going to <unk> that I was <unk> that I was <unk> that I was <unk> to the air and <unk> .
So I <unk> my face on the <unk> and <unk> my <unk> to a <unk> <unk> of the room .
And I said to <unk> , " <unk> , what , both we know that if this book is not going to be <unk> , no ?
Because you see I 'm <unk> everything I have , I have no more than that .
So if you want it to be better , you have to <unk> and make your part .
OK . But if you don 't do that , you know , you don 't know anything .
I started writing the same because it 's my job .
And I would like you to <unk> that I 'm <unk> to do my part of " Because -- it 's so , OK -- <unk> does in the <unk> of the <unk> Africa of the <unk> , people <unk> for the <unk> of the moon , <unk> music <unk> that <unk> for hours to <unk> .
And they were always <unk> , because the <unk> were <unk> and they were <unk> .
But every <unk> , <unk> , something <unk> , and one of these <unk> artists actually <unk> .
And I know what I talk about , because I know that you 've all seen , at some point , a <unk> .
It was like the time , and the <unk> <unk> through a kind of <unk> and not not doing anything else from <unk> usually , like <unk> <unk> before , but everything was <unk> .
And suddenly it doesn 't just like a human .
But it <unk> up and <unk> <unk> in the fire of the <unk> .
And when this <unk> , at the time , people <unk> what was , he <unk> with her name .
<unk> your hands and <unk> to <unk> , " <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , God , "
That 's God , you know .
<unk> <unk> -- when the <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> , <unk> this <unk> with them and the <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> , " <unk> , " <unk> , " <unk> , " <unk> , " which you can still feel in <unk> or in <unk> .
In <unk> , when a artist did something impossible and <unk> , " <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , " <unk> , <unk> , <unk> -- a <unk> of God .
And it 's <unk> because we need it .
But , the problem comes after day , for the <unk> , when you <unk> and <unk> that are 11 <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , and <unk> of God .
It 's just a <unk> with a lot of bad <unk> , and perhaps never <unk> to that <unk> .
And maybe nobody <unk> the name of God 's still <unk> , and what 's it needs to do with the rest of his life ?
It 's hard .
This is one of the most <unk> <unk> to make in a <unk> life .
But maybe it 's not to be so <unk> if you can 't believe , <unk> , that the most <unk> of your being being being being being being being being being <unk> .
But you just <unk> that you get data into <unk> from a <unk> source of this <unk> part of this <unk> of your life that you then have to <unk> when you finished .
And , you know , if we think it all .
And so I started <unk> , and it 's certainly how I <unk> it for several months during the <unk> of the book that I was going to <unk> , the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> of my success .
And what I have to continue to <unk> when I feel <unk> from this is , not fear .
You don 't know . You just have your job .
<unk> to <unk> for your side , any of you can be .
If your work is <unk> , <unk> .
If you <unk> , you 're going to <unk> you , you 're going to <unk> some kind of <unk> , for one moment through your <unk> , " <unk> ! "
<unk> , you do the same your <unk> .
And " <unk> ! " You do that same .
I think , and I think it <unk> .
" <unk> ! " <unk> ! " You 're just for having a human love and <unk> <unk> by <unk> <unk> .
Thank you .
Thank you .
<unk> <unk> : <unk> !
As you know , I talked about some of these projects on the human genome , what it can <unk> and discovery of new <unk> of genes .
Now we 're going to <unk> a new <unk> , and we started <unk> the biology and now starting from that digital code code , we 're <unk> in a new <unk> of biology , <unk> and <unk> life .
We always tried to ask big questions .
" What is life ? " It 's something that many <unk> , I think have <unk> to various levels .
We have different <unk> , <unk> to the <unk> terms .
We 're <unk> for about 20 years .
When we <unk> the human genome <unk> to go from the <unk> world of biology in the the world of the computer .
Now we ask about : can we <unk> the life , or create new life from this digital universe ?
This is a map of a little <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , which is the species from the <unk> genome between what they can <unk> in the lab .
And we tried to reduce the genome to <unk> a more <unk> .
We can <unk> a <unk> of <unk> of genes about 500 than 500 of genes that are here .
But when we take a look at his <unk> map , it 's very simple than our <unk> .
<unk> , that 's simple .
But when we look at all the genes that we can <unk> , one at the time , is very <unk> that this can bring to a <unk> cell .
So I thought that the only way to <unk> was <unk> this <unk> so that we could <unk> the <unk> to <unk> some of these questions .
And so we started the <unk> of " Can we <unk> a <unk> ? "
Can the chemistry that we have to make these big molecules that we 've never been able to create before ?
And , in case , we can make a <unk> ?
A <unk> is just a piece of <unk> material .
The speed that we 're able to <unk> life is <unk> to <unk> <unk> .
Our ability to write the <unk> code , instead , <unk> rather slowly , but it 's <unk> .
And our <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> .
We 've <unk> over 15 years ago .
The process has <unk> a lot of <unk> , <unk> with a <unk> <unk> before we had the first experiments .
But we 've discovered that we had DNA <unk> is very difficult .
There are <unk> of thousands of cars in the world that <unk> little <unk> of DNA , of <unk> , of 30 to 50 <unk> and it 's a <unk> process : the <unk> is a long , more <unk> there are .
So we had to develop a new <unk> to <unk> these <unk> and <unk> the <unk> .
And that was our first <unk> , starting to information digital <unk> genome .
It 's a little <unk> <unk> that bacteria .
We designed the <unk> , we <unk> the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> a <unk> of DNA <unk> .
The interesting part of this is when we took this piece of <unk> material and we <unk> it in bacteria , bacteria have <unk> to read this code code and <unk> particles .
The <unk> particles have been <unk> by cells , and they have <unk> back and have <unk> <unk> .
I talked about recently with members of the <unk> <unk> industry that they have certainly <unk> this model .
They have <unk> than you .
<unk> that this is a situation where the software can actually build his own <unk> in a <unk> system .
But we wanted to do the biggest thing .
We wanted to build the whole <unk> of <unk> .
They 're more than <unk> <unk> <unk> .
So we thought we were going to <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> , so that we can change the <unk> to understand what the <unk> of a <unk> cell .
<unk> is <unk> , and if you <unk> information <unk> in a computer , these have to be very <unk> .
When we <unk> this genome for the first time in <unk> , the standard <unk> was of a <unk> for every 10 <unk> <unk> .
We 've discovered , <unk> , 30 <unk> . If you used that original sequence original sequence .
A part of the process is to design <unk> 50 <unk> that <unk> with all the other <unk> of 50 <unk> to build <unk> smaller than <unk> together .
They 're <unk> elements here .
You probably read that that you were <unk> .
So we have a <unk> code that 's <unk> on four <unk> : A , <unk> , <unk> and <unk>
<unk> of those <unk> <unk> together <unk> , <unk> , and there 's a <unk> order to <unk> every <unk> .
So we can use the code for the words , <unk> , <unk> .
What we did at the beginning was <unk> .
Some of them have been <unk> by the fact that it wasn 't <unk> .
We designed these <unk> to <unk> just <unk> with <unk> .
There are <unk> that we <unk> them and <unk> them .
And we started <unk> with <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> so that they <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to them .
We 've produced these <unk> in <unk> so that we made these <unk> <unk> , so that we 're trying to create a extremely <unk> <unk> as you see in a minute .
We 're trying to <unk> the process .
So this looks like the <unk> of a <unk> <unk> .
When you start these <unk> <unk> , much , more than 100 <unk> <unk> , you don 't get to directly in the <unk> .
You get to the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> of <unk> biology .
So we 've <unk> other <unk> .
We 're going to talk about another <unk> called <unk> <unk> , which in biology <unk> to <unk> DNA <unk> .
Here 's an example .
This <unk> , called <unk> <unk> , can <unk> three million <unk> of <unk> .
You can see in the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> of his <unk> is <unk> .
In 12 hours , it 's been <unk> just as it was first .
<unk> thousands of organisms that can do it .
These organisms can <unk> completely .
You have to live under <unk> .
I 'm absolutely sure that life <unk> in space , and they <unk> to find new <unk> of water .
It 's actually , NASA 's shown that this happens .
This is a picture of the <unk> that we built these <unk> , just by <unk> the <unk> with the design of <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> them .
This picture was not <unk> with a <unk> <unk> , but with a <unk> <unk> .
It 's a <unk> that we can <unk> with a <unk> <unk> .
These are pictures that <unk> a period of about six seconds .
This is the <unk> that we 've done a little time ago .
They 're more than <unk> <unk> code .
It 's the biggest <unk> of a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
It has a <unk> <unk> to 300 million .
If you 're going to do that with a <unk> 10 <unk> , we 'll just be pages to <unk> this code .
Now , how do we make it work ? How can we do it ?
<unk> , with a virus is a <unk> game .
It 's a little bit more <unk> when you use of bacteria .
It 's <unk> cells as well when it comes to the <unk> cells like our : you just <unk> the <unk> and <unk> another , which is basically the <unk> process .
In <unk> , the <unk> is <unk> in the cell , but we <unk> <unk> that we are able to make a <unk> <unk> of a cell to another cell and to <unk> .
We <unk> a <unk> <unk> by a kind of <unk> .
The two are as many of the <unk> .
We 've <unk> some <unk> in more <unk> that we can decide which we could choose what this <unk> .
He then <unk> it with the <unk> so that they <unk> all the <unk> .
And when we put it in the cell it was <unk> and <unk> our <unk> the new <unk> <unk> , <unk> the new <unk> went into the cell .
And you 're <unk> that we don 't want to go beyond , but we tried to <unk> more in there .
This is one of the major <unk> of evolution .
We 've found that <unk> species have <unk> a second or a third or a third <unk> somewhere , <unk> in a second thousands of new <unk> to that species .
So who thinks about evolution as one <unk> at the time they don 't understand a lot of the biology .
We have <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that we <unk> the DNA .
The <unk> that was in the cell didn 't <unk> one .
The <unk> <unk> that we <unk> it .
It 's <unk> , and it <unk> the other <unk> as <unk> , has <unk> it , and we <unk> with just the cell and the new <unk> .
It became blue because of the genes that we have <unk> .
And in a short <unk> of time , all of the <unk> of a species are <unk> , and it <unk> of everything in a new species , <unk> on the new software that we <unk> in the cell .
All the <unk> are <unk> , and the <unk> are <unk> , and when you <unk> the code <unk> exactly to what we <unk> you .
Now this may look <unk> , but it <unk> the software , but we can <unk> the software that <unk> enough .
Now , I 've already <unk> that you don 't talk about <unk> -- but I 'm going to go from three million years and a half of evolution , and I said that maybe we 're going to create a new version of <unk> <unk> in which we <unk> new species <unk> on this <unk> .
Why do that ?
I think it 's pretty <unk> when we think of our <unk> .
We 're going to go for six and a half billion people in the next 40 years .
Right , to give one example : I was born in <unk> .
Now there are three people on the planet to <unk> in <unk> ; there 's four .
We 're <unk> problems now to find food , <unk> water and <unk> , <unk> and <unk> and <unk> for six billion people .
We 're even <unk> to do it for nine billion .
<unk> more than five billion <unk> , more than 30 billion <unk> .
That means 100 million <unk> a day .
When we try to find <unk> <unk> , or any kind of process to <unk> , it will be a huge challenge .
In more we have to realize that all of CO2 <unk> from these materials that <unk> in the atmosphere .
At the day , because of the <unk> <unk> all over the world , we have a <unk> with about 20 million genes , and I like to think that are <unk> <unk> for the future .
The <unk> industry is just a <unk> of <unk> , and think about how many different things are out .
Our <unk> here are data from the <unk> reality and our imagination .
Now we have <unk> , <unk> , <unk> to these <unk> <unk> , able to create what we call <unk> <unk> .
We can make a big robot that can produce a million <unk> a <unk> a day .
Think of <unk> these 20 million genes or <unk> to try to <unk> the <unk> or <unk> , new <unk> , we can change , because of a small team , and create more biology biology now than in the last 20 years of science .
And it 's just a standard <unk> .
We can choose to <unk> , <unk> , chemistry or <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
This is a few software <unk> that we 're working on to be able to <unk> and design species to design and design species to computers .
Well , we don 't know how they 're going to be .
We know exactly what their <unk> code is .
Now we 're <unk> on the <unk> of <unk> generation .
You also saw that <unk> from the <unk> was a <unk> experiment .
We have <unk> <unk> <unk> and third generation that we 're going to get enough to <unk> <unk> , like <unk> or different kinds of <unk> .
But the only way the biology can have a big impact without <unk> the cost of food and <unk> the <unk> would be <unk> the CO2 and <unk> the <unk> would be <unk> the CO2 , and we 're working on to design cells that we can get to make the first <unk> of <unk> in about 18 months .
<unk> <unk> with CO2 , and it 's a <unk> but in our <unk> <unk> around the world , we found different <unk> .
This is a <unk> that we <unk> in <unk> .
It <unk> in the ocean , at about <unk> feet of the temperature of water .
We 're <unk> by CO2 using hydrogen <unk> as <unk> as source .
We 're trying to understand whether we can <unk> the CO2 , which can be <unk> through <unk> , <unk> that CO2 in <unk> , to drive this process .
So the short of the <unk> we can think that we can <unk> what the basic question of what life is , we , we <unk> the <unk> goal to <unk> the whole <unk> industry .
<unk> . If you cannot do it from TED , where you can ?
It 's a main source of energy .
And we 're working for the same <unk> to use the same <unk> to create <unk> .
You 've seen this year with the flu , we 're always back a year and with a dollar in less when it 's about finding the right .
I think what you can change , building <unk> in <unk> .
So that 's how the future could start looking for it , now , the tree of evolution , <unk> with bacteria , <unk> , and finally cells .
We 're in so far from <unk> people .
Our purpose is to make a way of living living enough to try to <unk> it . Thank you very much .
So , first , I 'll show you , the <unk> that you can , some fundamental work , and we brought to <unk> at <unk> at a <unk> almost a year ago . This is <unk> .
It 's a <unk> where you can <unk> is at a local level that <unk> with a huge amount of data .
Here we 're seeing <unk> of <unk> <unk> with a kind of <unk> <unk> and <unk> , for a quick <unk> , <unk> the images , and it 's a quick <unk> , <unk> the images as we want .
And it doesn 't matter how much is the amount of information that we see , how big <unk> of data or images .
Most pictures are <unk> , but this for example is a <unk> <unk> by the <unk> of the <unk> , and <unk> in the <unk> of 300 <unk> .
It doesn 't make any difference because the only thing you <unk> the <unk> of a system like this is the number of <unk> on your screen at any time . It 's also a very <unk> architecture .
This is a whole book , example of data , <unk> not images .
This is the <unk> <unk> . Every <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
So to <unk> that 's really <unk> and not about images , we can do something like that , to actually see that it 's a real <unk> of the text , not of a picture .
It could be a little bit <unk> to read a <unk> book .
You don 't <unk> it .
This is a more <unk> example . It 's a <unk> number of The <unk> .
Every image is the beginning of a <unk> .
And it really gives you the pleasure and the experience of reading the real version of a <unk> or a <unk> , which is for nature a <unk> .
We also did something with the corner of this particular number of The <unk> .
We 've created a <unk> <unk> <unk> , much higher than what you use in a normal <unk> and we <unk> you <unk> of the content .
If you want to see the <unk> of this <unk> , you can see here .
Or some <unk> , even <unk> .
And this really <unk> some of these ideas to <unk> the <unk> of space on the screen .
We think this <unk> to put in the <unk> and other <unk> like that , not <unk> to be <unk> .
Of course , the <unk> is one of the most <unk> <unk> for this kind of technology .
And on this , I don 't want to lose time , if not say that we have <unk> to do in this field .
These are all the streets in the United States <unk> over a picture of the NASA <unk> .
So I 'm going to start with something else .
This is actually living on the Web ; you can see you start to see .
It 's a project called <unk> , which <unk> two different technologies .
One is <unk> and the other is a <unk> research that 's very interesting <unk> that made by <unk> <unk> , a student of the Washington <unk> , with the help of <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . A <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And it 's live on the Web , <unk> .
You can <unk> when we do this kind of <unk> , where we do this , and have this kind of experience <unk> .
But the <unk> <unk> of the images here actually has a meaning .
The <unk> <unk> of computers have <unk> these images together , so that they <unk> the <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> <unk> on the <unk> <unk> <unk> on the <unk> <unk> <unk> on the <unk> <unk> <unk> , and these things have been <unk> . So here you see some <unk> of <unk> , and these things have all <unk> .
I don 't know if I have time to show you some other environment .
There are a lot more <unk> .
I want to go directly directly to one of the <unk> data and this <unk> from a <unk> <unk> <unk> that we did work for the first time , to show you what we did work is really the key behind this technology , the <unk> technology , the <unk> technology , the <unk> technology , and it 's not <unk> . It 's <unk> <unk> <unk> that we have in the website .
We had to <unk> some <unk> and so on .
This is a <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> images of <unk> . <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> and <unk> images of <unk> in <unk> , other <unk> and <unk> and <unk> images , and so on . We <unk> of these <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
So they 're all <unk> images from <unk> and have all <unk> <unk> on the <unk> level like this .
And it 's possible to <unk> this <unk> way .
You know , I would never have thought of , to work for <unk> .
It 's very <unk> <unk> <unk> this kind of <unk> here .
I think you 're going to see that it 's a lot of different kinds of <unk> : from the cell phone to those <unk> <unk> , a <unk> number , <unk> together in this environment .
And if I can , I can <unk> to look for the <unk> .
Many are <unk> by <unk> , etc . .
There 's a series of pictures here -- <unk> .
This is a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
We can go from the <unk> to the physics of this environment .
The <unk> is that we can do things with social environment . This is now <unk> from <unk> data from the whole <unk> memory of how to <unk> the earth , from the <unk> of <unk> <unk> and <unk> all that data together .
All those pictures become <unk> together , greater than the <unk> .
You have a model of the whole thing that <unk> .
Think about this as the <unk> of the work of <unk> <unk> on Earth .
It 's something that you <unk> in complexity as people <unk> , and the <unk> that you 're going to <unk> it with the use .
Their pictures are <unk> with <unk> by other people .
If someone 's coming up the idea of <unk> all these <unk> <unk> the name , my picture of <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> all those data , and I can use it as a <unk> <unk> to <unk> in that space , by using the <unk> of anyone , and have a social experience <unk> and <unk> .
Of course , a <unk> of all this is <unk> models of every interesting part of the earth , <unk> not just by <unk> <unk> and <unk> images and <unk> , but the <unk> memory .
<unk> <unk> .
Chris Anderson : I realized what your software is , what your software your software <unk> to do is that at some point , in the next few years , all the pictures of anyone in the world are <unk> <unk> together ?
<unk> : Yes . What 's doing is doing in fact , it 's going to find out .
It 's creating <unk> , if you want , between images .
And it 's <unk> at the content of the images .
What it becomes very interesting if you think about the <unk> of information that many of these images .
As you do a research <unk> and the <unk> , you <unk> a <unk> and the text on the page , has a lot of information about the images of the images of the picture .
Now , what if that picture is going on the <unk> to all your pictures ?
So the amount of <unk> <unk> and the amount of <unk> that is really huge . It 's a <unk> effect .
CA : <unk> , it 's really incredible .
<unk> : You very much .
One of the main <unk> when you <unk> and one of the <unk> research is to be to live between who has not <unk> the <unk> <unk> , between who <unk> the <unk> <unk> , <unk> the <unk> <unk> of plants .
You think that <unk> <unk> are still <unk> in <unk> <unk> , or that the <unk> of <unk> <unk> are still <unk> of <unk> , or that in <unk> , the <unk> <unk> still the <unk> of the <unk> , to <unk> the <unk> of <unk> , and that the idea that the world in which we live in in a sense , but it 's only a <unk> model , but it 's just a <unk> model of reality .
the <unk> of a particular <unk> of <unk> choices that our <unk> has done , good or evil , many <unk> .
And , of course , all <unk> of the <unk> <unk> .
Everybody <unk> . <unk> .
We 're <unk> to <unk> .
We have to deal with the <unk> of death , so we don 't know if we <unk> and <unk> --
We all have an art .
What <unk> is the <unk> <unk> of the song , the <unk> of every culture .
It doesn 't matter that matter the <unk> of <unk> , or the <unk> of <unk> , or the <unk> of <unk> <unk> , or the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , or a <unk> in the <unk> of <unk> .
He was my <unk> of journey in <unk> a month ago , or a <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> , on the <unk> , the <unk> mother of the world .
All these <unk> are <unk> that there are other ways of thinking , other ways of moving in the world .
And if you look at a moment , it 's a concept that can give you hope .
<unk> , the <unk> of <unk> in the world create a <unk> of <unk> and <unk> that <unk> the planet and is important for the <unk> of the planet as the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And you can think of this <unk> <unk> as a <unk> and you can <unk> the <unk> of all the <unk> , dreams , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , ideas , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> in being by the human imagination of the <unk> .
<unk> is the fantastic <unk> of humanity .
It 's the <unk> of what we are and what we can be as <unk> species .
And <unk> the <unk> was <unk> <unk> <unk> was successful at <unk> and <unk> much faster .
<unk> <unk> , for example , <unk> that 50 percent of all species has been or is on the <unk> of <unk> , or it 's <unk> , or -- in the <unk> <unk> -- in the field of the <unk> diversity -- and not even <unk> <unk> -- that 's not even <unk> <unk> -- that 's the <unk> diversity .
The <unk> of this is , of course , the <unk> <unk> .
When you 're <unk> <unk> <unk> on this planet .
A language is not just <unk> by a <unk> or a series of <unk> rules .
A language is the human spirit of the human spirit .
It 's the medium that the <unk> of every culture comes in the world .
Every language is a forest of the mind , a <unk> , a <unk> of <unk> .
And those <unk> <unk> , while we 're sitting here at least , at half the <unk> is no longer <unk> in the <unk> of children .
They don 't come to children , which means , unless you do something , which is that they 're dead .
What 's more <unk> than being <unk> by <unk> , of being <unk> by <unk> , the last to talk a language , of not having a way of <unk> the <unk> or to <unk> the <unk> of <unk> or of <unk> ?
This <unk> <unk> was the state of somebody in the world every two weeks : every two weeks , a <unk> <unk> and door with <unk> in the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And I know that some of you who are <unk> . " <unk> 't it ?
The world wouldn 't be a better place if we all have the same language ? " So we talk about <unk> .
<unk> <unk> .
We 're going to say , you know , you can 't talk about your language .
I 'd like to give you a journey to make a journey through the <unk> --
a little journey in the <unk> to give you a <unk> of what we 're doing .
Many of us <unk> that when I say , " different ways of <unk> , I mean , really different ways of <unk> .
So , for example this <unk> <unk> , <unk> , the <unk> of <unk> , which <unk> <unk> <unk> from the <unk> <unk> <unk> from the <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> .
It 's a <unk> that 's not able to <unk> the blue color from green because the <unk> is <unk> in the <unk> of the forest , which <unk> the forest <unk> .
They have a <unk> language and a <unk> rule , <unk> , " <unk> <unk> , " <unk> <unk> , " you have a different language .
All of that has <unk> in the past <unk> , but the <unk> is that in these <unk> families in which they talk six or seven <unk> because of <unk> <unk> <unk> nobody .
They 're going to hear and then you start talking .
<unk> one of the most interesting <unk> that I 've lived , the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , an incredible <unk> that had the first <unk> in <unk> .
In <unk> , they <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
They 've done by the top pictures that <unk> them in <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> , which this <unk> of the <unk> forest <unk> had never seen anything .
They <unk> the <unk> of the earth , they have <unk> to <unk> a form or a <unk> , not <unk> anything , they have <unk> that <unk> <unk> , and they didn 't <unk> anything , and they have <unk> the five <unk> with <unk> .
But the <unk> don 't just <unk> .
They 're <unk> with them .
<unk> percent of <unk> <unk> was <unk> by themselves .
We 're ready to eight <unk> and we found two <unk> , and when we <unk> to know , they <unk> that one of them was <unk> so that he died , and then they <unk> it . They <unk> it . They <unk> the same . [ <unk> ] <unk> <unk> <unk> . At any way , they had an incredible knowledge of the forest .
The <unk> were able to recognize the animal <unk> , and to <unk> the species .
<unk> <unk> , and I was a really interesting job when my <unk> <unk> , if my <unk> <unk> <unk> me if I wanted to go to <unk> in <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
To make sense of <unk> , I should have understand the <unk> culture , and that <unk> is not <unk> .
It 's pretty much about a <unk> <unk> vision of the world .
Very interesting .
If you 're going to <unk> the big <unk> of the world , what do you do ?
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , etc . .
A continent is always left out , thinking , that <unk> Africa doesn 't have <unk> <unk> . And instead and <unk> is not what the <unk> of these <unk> <unk> very <unk> during the <unk> <unk> .
What makes the <unk> is the <unk> of the <unk> between life and death .
So , <unk> do <unk> <unk> .
<unk> can be <unk> by the <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , so that for a short moment , the <unk> becomes the <unk> .
So , for <unk> <unk> , " <unk> , you go to <unk> and God .
We <unk> in <unk> and <unk> God . "
And when you 're <unk> , is the spirit that you can use you bad , how do you get you wrong with it ?
So , they <unk> to these incredible events : <unk> <unk> in the state of <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a rather <unk> of the power of the mind when it 's <unk> in a state of <unk> <unk> .
<unk> all the <unk> that I have lived with the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , in the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> of <unk> civilization <unk> that once <unk> on the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of <unk> , the <unk> <unk> on the <unk> .
In a <unk> continent , <unk> , this <unk> never has been <unk> by <unk> .
In <unk> , I 'm <unk> today , but their <unk> is extraordinary .
The young <unk> are <unk> by <unk> <unk> , and they live in a <unk> world , and they live <unk> in a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> for 18 years .
Two <unk> of nine years old of nine years from the <unk> of <unk> that <unk> in the <unk> of the mother , now are <unk> in the <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
For that , they 're <unk> to the values of their society , values that <unk> their <unk> and only their <unk> <unk> <unk> -- or to say the <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> of this incredible <unk> , they 're <unk> out and for the first time in their life , at the age of 18 , see an <unk> . And in that moment of the first <unk> , when the sun <unk> <unk> , all they have been <unk> out of <unk> , everything they have in <unk> , everything they have been <unk> in the <unk> <unk> , and he says ,
" <unk> ? I 'm going to tell you .
It 's <unk> . Now it 's like you 're <unk> . "
They 're called <unk> , and they say that we , <unk> <unk> , we are the <unk> of the world .
This level of <unk> is extremely important .
When we think about the <unk> <unk> and the <unk> <unk> and the old story of the <unk> <unk> , which is a concept in its <unk> or maybe <unk> <unk> and say that these <unk> are closer to the Earth of us .
<unk> <unk> are not <unk> or <unk> by <unk> .
There is no space for these things in the <unk> <unk> of <unk> or in the <unk> <unk> of <unk> , but because of time and <unk> , they created a <unk> of the Earth <unk> not on <unk> <unk> , but on a <unk> <unk> <unk> , but on a <unk> <unk> <unk> , but on a <unk> <unk> <unk> , but on a <unk> <unk> of human consciousness .
What does that mean ?
It means that a <unk> of the <unk> that <unk> the mountain is a <unk> spirit that <unk> its <unk> is going to be <unk> human being <unk> and <unk> a very different relationship with the mountain or the place , or the <unk> of a <unk> of <unk> that <unk> a mountain is a <unk> of <unk> <unk> to be <unk> .
which is a <unk> of a spirit or a <unk> is <unk> .
What 's interesting is the <unk> that <unk> the relationship between <unk> and the natural world .
I grew up in the <unk> <unk> <unk> that the <unk> <unk> to be <unk> .
That made me a human being different from my <unk> friends who believe that the <unk> are the <unk> of <unk> and the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> and the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> and the <unk> <unk> that live during the <unk> <unk> .
If you start <unk> that these <unk> can actually create different , we can start to understand some of the <unk> . We want to understand some of them . They <unk> this <unk> .
I 've <unk> this picture in <unk> in <unk> <unk> .
<unk> some of you have heard about <unk> , the most powerful <unk> of the <unk> <unk> .
What makes the <unk> is not the potential <unk> of the <unk> , but it 's <unk> . It <unk> by two elements .
On one hand , this <unk> <unk> that <unk> a series of <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
<unk> the only <unk> has a <unk> <unk> that <unk> a little bit , but it 's <unk> with the <unk> of a <unk> 's family of <unk> said <unk> .
This <unk> <unk> <unk> , very similar to <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
If you 're going to see the <unk> <unk> <unk> , the <unk> that they do from a different <unk> of species , it <unk> .
<unk> that <unk> on the <unk> is a little bit of how to be <unk> by a <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> on a sea of electricity . <unk> . <unk> 't creates a <unk> of the reality of the <unk> .
I often was with my <unk> , Richard <unk> , the man who <unk> the <unk> was <unk> , with his discovery of <unk> in the ' <unk> .
I think I can 't <unk> these <unk> as <unk> because if you 're done , you can 't tell anybody to be <unk> . <unk> 't they 're <unk> , but they can 't be <unk> because they 're <unk> by a <unk> that is , of course , <unk> <unk> .
It 's possible to <unk> , just if you start with other <unk> <unk> that <unk> the <unk> .
Now it 's the <unk> : the <unk> that are <unk> in this <unk> are <unk> , the same kind of <unk> <unk> , the same <unk> that you have to <unk> the <unk> . The question <unk> <unk> : in a <unk> of <unk> species , how do these <unk> <unk> are not like that , but if you <unk> it in this way , they make a <unk> version that 's more than the <unk> ?
We use the big <unk> of <unk> and <unk> , which can <unk> <unk> .
But if you go to the <unk> , we 'll be " The plants talk . "
What does that mean ?
This <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , who <unk> <unk> , who <unk> <unk> in the forest , and that our eyes <unk> in the same species .
If you know how they <unk> their <unk> <unk> us , " <unk> <unk> , " <unk> <unk> , " <unk> . " I said , " No . "
The solution is : you take the <unk> <unk> in a night , <unk> <unk> and <unk> with a different <unk> .
So , you don 't get <unk> , but it 's much more interesting than <unk> <unk> .
Now , the problem is that the ones of us who have <unk> <unk> them , but somehow <unk> to the <unk> of history of our real <unk> , and some <unk> way to the <unk> of history than our real world , and beyond .
In fact , the <unk> century , in the <unk> century , not <unk> for its <unk> or his <unk> <unk> , but rather as the <unk> was where we <unk> and <unk> <unk> or <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> diversity and <unk> and <unk> on the planet . Now the problem is not the change .
All <unk> through the <unk> have been <unk> in a <unk> for new possibilities .
And the problem is not technology .
The <unk> <unk> have no <unk> to be <unk> when they put <unk> and <unk> as <unk> as <unk> don 't have <unk> to be <unk> and <unk> .
It 's not the change or the technology that <unk> the <unk> of <unk> . It 's the power .
The <unk> <unk> .
And if you look at a look at the world , you 'll see that these are not <unk> <unk> .
They 're <unk> creatures and <unk> <unk> out of the <unk> forces that go beyond their <unk> <unk> .
<unk> that <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of <unk> --
a <unk> <unk> <unk> , in <unk> <unk> , a <unk> that has been <unk> in the forest to a generation of <unk> , and now <unk> to the <unk> and the <unk> of the <unk> , where you can see the <unk> <unk> from the <unk> <unk> that looks <unk> up by the <unk> <unk> <unk> , where the <unk> <unk> <unk> , where the <unk> <unk> <unk> ,
We 're going to <unk> the <unk> with the forest <unk> .
Or , in the case of <unk> , are the disease that are <unk> with the discovery of <unk> .
If you <unk> on the <unk> of the <unk> , where I 'm doing a lot of research , you see the <unk> of the political <unk> .
As you <unk> , <unk> physics , the physics of a <unk> , is <unk> <unk> , but <unk> , the <unk> of <unk> <unk> , not only is <unk> , but <unk> <unk> in certain <unk> , because it 's <unk> in certain <unk> , because it 's <unk> part of development .
And you can 't understand the <unk> of the <unk> until you start .
I <unk> miles from <unk> in China through the <unk> <unk> , <unk> with a young <unk> , but only come to <unk> with a young <unk> , but only come to <unk> , I realized what the <unk> behind .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> million people <unk> from the <unk> during the <unk> <unk> .
The father of this guy was <unk> at <unk> <unk> .
which means that it was <unk> at the time of the Chinese <unk> .
<unk> <unk> is <unk> with <unk> <unk> during the <unk> who brought the <unk> in <unk> .
My mother was <unk> and his <unk> was to be <unk> .
It 's taken to <unk> in <unk> at age of two <unk> years of his <unk> , because he couldn 't have no of him .
The <unk> , who did the same , was <unk> in <unk> <unk> .
One day he <unk> a <unk> <unk> , and for this <unk> , was <unk> to work for seven years .
The <unk> of <unk> can be <unk> , but the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> is by <unk> present .
At the end , it <unk> a choice .
You want to live in the <unk> world or we want to <unk> the <unk> world of diversity ?
The great <unk> <unk> <unk> , before he died said that the biggest <unk> of <unk> was that , in our <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , not only <unk> the whole <unk> of the human imagination imagination to a <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> that there were other possibilities .
And it 's <unk> to remember that our species is <unk> for <unk> years .
The <unk> <unk> , who gave us <unk> , who gave us <unk> , <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> , <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> , creating the <unk> of <unk> , creating the <unk> of <unk> , creating the <unk> of <unk> , and we talk about <unk> years ago .
The <unk> world has been <unk> 300 years old .
That <unk> story , I don 't believe that we have answers to all the challenges that we <unk> in <unk> to come .
When these <unk> <unk> of the world is asked what it means to be human , <unk> with <unk> <unk> different .
And it 's in these answers that we all have the chance to be what we are : a <unk> species , which has to make sure that all the <unk> and all the <unk> can <unk> . And there are great moments of <unk> .
I <unk> this picture on the north of <unk> , when I went to <unk> <unk> with <unk> , and this man , <unk> , and this man , <unk> , he <unk> me the wonderful story of his <unk> .
The <unk> government wasn 't always <unk> with the <unk> <unk> and in the <unk> <unk> for our <unk> , we <unk> them in <unk> .
The <unk> of this guy <unk> <unk> .
The family , <unk> for his life , the <unk> away all the <unk> , and all of his <unk> .
You want to know that the <unk> don 't <unk> , you know .
The <unk> <unk> were made of fish <unk> in <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> of this guy didn 't <unk> from <unk> night or <unk> .
It 's <unk> , it <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> in your hand . When I did it <unk> it , he <unk> it , he <unk> it <unk> it by creating a <unk> .
He <unk> <unk> on the <unk> of this <unk> <unk> and when <unk> <unk> , he <unk> a dog .
He <unk> the dog and created a <unk> , with the <unk> <unk> created a <unk> , has <unk> another dog and it 's <unk> on the <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
What about <unk> ?
<unk> <unk> the <unk> government <unk> to <unk> the <unk> control of an area of larger <unk> in California and <unk> together .
It 's their new <unk> . It 's called <unk> .
It 's a <unk> <unk> . It 's <unk> all the <unk> resources .
One example of how a <unk> can <unk> with his <unk> .
And , finally , I think it 's pretty <unk> at least who 's been in these <unk> areas of the planet , <unk> that they realize that they don 't have any <unk> at all .
For somebody is home .
<unk> <unk> of the human imagination that <unk> to the <unk> of the time . And for all of these children , like the dream of our children , they become part of the <unk> hope .
So , we <unk> <unk> , we 're <unk> that the <unk> will not be at anything .
I would say that <unk> --
[ <unk> ] ] they 're not <unk> , but we believe that stories can change the world , and perhaps we are the best <unk> to tell the stories of the world . Every month our website <unk> <unk> million <unk> .
<unk> <unk> our <unk> .
Our <unk> are <unk> by millions of people .
Our work is <unk> in <unk> to bring our public in places of <unk> <unk> from which <unk> <unk> from which <unk> <unk> from what they were <unk> and , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , the <unk> world of <unk> , and we have to find a <unk> of life in a <unk> world and <unk> .
where we <unk> all the <unk> can <unk> to our <unk> <unk> .
Thank you .
I 'm going to talk about some of the things that I wrote in this book that I hope to <unk> other you heard and <unk> some <unk> <unk> , in case you don 't .
I want to start with what I call the <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> of what ?
The <unk> <unk> of all <unk> society <unk> . The <unk> <unk> <unk> , " If we want to <unk> the <unk> of our citizens . " The way to do it is to <unk> freedom <unk> . "
The reason is , on the one hand , in the fact that the freedom is <unk> , <unk> , <unk> for human beings .
On the other one is that if we 're <unk> , every one of us can act to <unk> for everything that we had our <unk> , without anybody who <unk> in our <unk> .
The way to <unk> the freedom is to <unk> the choice .
More choices people have , more choices are <unk> , and more about their freedom , more than they do , and more choices is their <unk> .
This is , <unk> , it 's so <unk> <unk> in society that nobody <unk> in <unk> .
And it 's also <unk> <unk> in our lives .
I 'll show you some examples of what progress has made it possible .
This is my <unk> . It 's not particularly big .
I <unk> a simple note on the <unk> to <unk> .
In my <unk> , there are <unk> <unk> , without <unk> the <unk> of <unk> <unk> and the 12 <unk> <unk> that you can buy for a huge number of <unk> in the <unk> <unk> that no one of the <unk> <unk> in the <unk> that no one of the <unk> <unk> is <unk> .
That 's what the <unk> is .
Then you go to the <unk> store for <unk> , to buy a <unk> : <unk> , radio , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
And in this single <unk> store , there 's a big number of <unk> <unk> .
We can do six and a half million different <unk> <unk> with the <unk> that there are only one <unk> .
<unk> <unk> that there is <unk> .
<unk> <unk> : the world of <unk> .
Once , when I was a child , you could get all the services <unk> , <unk> <unk> that were <unk> by <unk> <unk> .
They <unk> the phone , they didn 't <unk> it .
A <unk> of that , by the way , was that the phone never <unk> .
These times they went .
We have a <unk> <unk> of <unk> , especially between cell cell phones .
Here 's cell phone future .
My <unk> is in the middle , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , and <unk> for the <unk> <unk> .
If you haven 't seen it yet in the store under the house , you 're very <unk> that soon soon .
And what happens is that people <unk> in the <unk> and does this question . And you know what is the answer ? The answer is , " No . "
It 's not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn 't face <unk> .
So , in other <unk> of life that are much more important than <unk> , <unk> the same <unk> of choices .
<unk> <unk> : <unk> , no longer in the United States you 're going to <unk> you what you have to do .
Instead , you get it from the <unk> , and the <unk> says , " OK , you can do it . " And he 's got these <unk> and these <unk> " <unk> " <unk> " <unk> these <unk> and these <unk> . What do you want to do ? "
You ask him , " <unk> , what do you do ? "
And the <unk> says , " He has these <unk> and these <unk> , and <unk> has these <unk> and these <unk> . "
" What do you want to do ? "
And you say , " <unk> if you were me , what ? "
And the <unk> : " But I 'm not her . "
We call the " <unk> <unk> , " <unk> <unk> , " <unk> <unk> , " <unk> that makes it look beautiful .
But actually it 's not a <unk> that <unk> the weight and responsibility to make decisions from someone who knows something , <unk> the <unk> , to somebody who knows that -- and almost certainly is <unk> -- and therefore , of course , is <unk> -- and therefore not in the <unk> <unk> to make decisions about the patient ,
There 's a huge <unk> of <unk> , <unk> to people like me and you , if you think about it doesn 't make sense , because we can 't <unk> .
But if we can 't <unk> , why do we get them ?
The answer is that they want to <unk> , we call the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
We think that as a fundamental way of our <unk> is now a question of how do we see in this <unk> . " We don 't want to <unk> the children . They 're not going to be <unk> . " We don 't want to <unk> a <unk> .
And we can <unk> how many times we do .
which means that every <unk> , to the <unk> , you have to decide that kind of person ,
I 'm going to go to the family and <unk> , a common time perspective , almost for anyone , was that you <unk> the <unk> <unk> as soon as possible .
The only real choice was with who , not when , and not , even what to do later .
<unk> , it 's really to play .
They 're going to be very smart , and they <unk> them 20 percent less work than a time .
And not because they 're not <unk> , because they 're not <unk> .
but why are I 'm <unk> , you say , " <unk> <unk> or not ? "
" <unk> <unk> <unk> ? I have to think about the <unk> or the career or the career ? "
They 're <unk> <unk> .
And they try to answer these questions , even if this <unk> doesn 't <unk> the <unk> that you can 't get the <unk> that you can 't get a beautiful <unk> to my <unk> .
And they have to do that . They 're important questions .
Now , the work : we 're <unk> , as <unk> , because technology technology <unk> us to work every minute , every day , from every corner of the planet , <unk> that from the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , there 's a <unk> , and I 'm not going to say , where the <unk> works .
I don 't say that , because I want to use it .
What does , this incredible freedom of choice that we have about the work ? It 's that we have to decide , <unk> at all time , if we have to work or not .
We can go to see our son to play , with the cell phone in a <unk> , the <unk> in the other , and the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
And even if I 'm all <unk> , every minute we see our son , we 're also <unk> , " I should answer this call ? "
" I have to answer this <unk> ? I have to get this letter ? "
And even when the answer is , " no , that makes the experience of your son very different from what would be in other conditions .
So , from any of us , you know , small , big things , materials and <unk> of life , life is a matter of choices .
Once the world was this : <unk> , there were some possibilities , but not everything was a matter of choice .
The world of today are <unk> to this : The <unk> is , " Is it a <unk> thing , or <unk> ? "
The answer is <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> them all know , so I 'm going to talk about the <unk> .
<unk> this <unk> choice , two effects effects of people .
The first , <unk> , is that it <unk> instead of <unk> .
With a lot of <unk> between which <unk> , it becomes very difficult to do it .
I 'll give you a <unk> example : a study <unk> <unk> <unk> .
A <unk> of my <unk> <unk> data , <unk> society , with about a <unk> <unk> , with about a million <unk> <unk> in different <unk> .
What she discovered is that for 10 solutions , which is being <unk> , the <unk> of <unk> <unk> two percent .
With 50 <unk> <unk> , there 's 10 percent less <unk> than when they 're available there are only five percent . Why ?
Because with 50 <unk> of which <unk> , is to decide , and the choice is <unk> to <unk> .
And in <unk> , and still <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and of course , <unk> never comes .
<unk> that doesn 't mean just that these <unk> <unk> <unk> food to <unk> because they don 't have enough money , you want to say that the decision is so <unk> that they also <unk> <unk> <unk> of the work .
They 're not <unk> , they 're <unk> <unk> for <unk> year from the <unk> of work , that would be <unk> to <unk> .
So the <unk> is a <unk> of having <unk> choices .
And I think that 's going to change the world .
" And finally , for <unk> : <unk> , <unk> or <unk> ? "
You have the right decision , if it 's for <unk> , isn 't it ?
You don 't want to choose the wrong <unk> , and you <unk> the wrong <unk> .
So that 's the first effect . The second one is that even if we can <unk> the <unk> and make choice , finally , less than the result of how we were <unk> with less between which which <unk> .
And that 's a few reasons .
One of them is that with a lot of <unk> between <unk> , if you <unk> one and not perfect , it 's very easy to imagine that they could make a different choice that would be better . And what 's going on is that the <unk> <unk> <unk> us to <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> <unk> from <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> from the <unk> decision , and the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> decision ,
even when it was a <unk> decision .
More choices there are , more choices to <unk> than any <unk> that you can <unk> to <unk> choice .
<unk> , there 's what <unk> call .
Dan <unk> has <unk> very well to <unk> how the value that we take things to what we do .
<unk> , when there are many <unk> possible , it 's easy to <unk> the <unk> of <unk> <unk> and be less <unk> than the <unk> of <unk> that has choice .
Here 's an example . I 'm <unk> with all the ones that are not in New York .
But that 's what you probably do .
There 's this <unk> to <unk> .
A place of <unk> .
<unk> <unk> . <unk> day . It 's all for them .
It doesn 't <unk> anything . But what he thinks is , " Well , <unk> , it 's <unk> . "
" All my <unk> <unk> are away . "
" <unk> <unk> <unk> right in front of the home . "
And it <unk> two weeks from the idea that 's going to <unk> -- every day -- the possibility of <unk> where it wants .
The <unk> <unk> for what we have , even when the choice was <unk> .
And the <unk> that we have from <unk> , the more <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> us against how to <unk> .
Here 's another example .
This <unk> tells us a lot of things .
It 's about living the moment , and perhaps of living living slowly .
But the most important thing is that anything you want , you 're going to be <unk> .
The things that don 't <unk> a lot of <unk> that can make less <unk> what we do .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> .
I tried it on my skin <unk> a new couple of <unk> .
It <unk> always <unk> .
Once the <unk> were just one , they were <unk> , and they were <unk> , only after <unk> , and they were <unk> , only after they had a <unk> and <unk> a lot of times , we go good .
So , I started to <unk> a new couple of when the <unk> were gone , and I said , " I need a couple of <unk> , this is my <unk> . "
The <unk> said , " <unk> does it want to <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> ? "
You want them to <unk> or with <unk> ? " <unk> " or " <unk> " ? "
" " Do you want them to <unk> ? "
" <unk> you want them to <unk> or <unk> ? <unk> <unk> -- " <unk> .
I was <unk> , and after a little bit I was able to say , " I want the guy that was the only guy . " He didn 't know what it was , so for a time , all of a <unk> <unk> , then <unk> from the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> with the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> with the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> with the <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> with the <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> with
It was the <unk> . With all that choice I had <unk> it .
But I 'm going to get worse .
Why ? I wrote a whole book to <unk> .
The reason I was worse is that with all that choice my <unk> were <unk> , the <unk> <unk> to be <unk> .
I had <unk> <unk> . I didn 't <unk> anything that was <unk> when I was just <unk> a guy , but when I was 100 different , you had to be perfect .
What I had <unk> was good , but not perfect .
After I <unk> that I <unk> with what I was <unk> in <unk> to <unk> .
The <unk> of <unk> in the life of people don 't make the <unk> that these <unk> of the <unk> <unk> .
And this is <unk> <unk> , even when the results are good .
<unk> in the world of <unk> if they realize .
Because if you <unk> , you don 't know what I 'm talking about .
The truth is more than that .
" It was better when it was worse , " The reason that he was better when he was worse , when he was worse , it was even possible to <unk> <unk> .
<unk> , in the world that we live -- <unk> , <unk> citizens with the <unk> of <unk> -- the <unk> that we can <unk> is that things are <unk> to the <unk> of <unk> .
You 've never never <unk> <unk> because your <unk> , my <unk> , <unk> , are <unk> .
The <unk> of happiness -- what you 're here -- is , " <unk> <unk> " Yes , you want him . "
I mean , little <unk> moment -- who are really <unk> and my wife is really <unk> .
I couldn 't do better , I didn 't <unk> .
But <unk> doesn 't always <unk> .
<unk> , a <unk> of <unk> <unk> when there 's only that kind of <unk> <unk> when there 's only that kind of <unk> is that when you 're not <unk> , and you say , " Why ? "
" Who is <unk> ? " I think the answer is <unk> .
The world is <unk> . What can I do you ?
When there are hundreds of kinds of <unk> , and you get one <unk> , and you 're going to <unk> you who is the <unk> , it 's clear that the <unk> you are .
I could have better .
With hundreds of <unk> available , there are no <unk> for <unk> .
So when people make decisions , even if the result is <unk> , they <unk> and give them their own <unk> .
In the last few years , the <unk> is <unk> in the <unk> world .
I think a <unk> <unk> -- not the only , but important -- of this <unk> of <unk> is that people have <unk> experiences because the standard is too <unk> .
And when they have to <unk> that they think the <unk> is them .
So the final result is that in general we 're better , <unk> , but we 'll get worse .
Let me tell you .
This is the <unk> <unk> , what we all take good and it 's completely <unk> . It 's not true .
There 's no <unk> that a little bit of choice is better than not at all , but from that , not <unk> that much choice is better than a little bit .
There 's a <unk> , <unk> . I don 't know what it is .
But I 'm sure we 've <unk> from a piece of the level in which the choices <unk> our life .
Now , from a <unk> point of view -- from a <unk> point of view , the <unk> is the <unk> .
What allows all this choice in the <unk> society is the <unk> material .
There are many places in the world , and you know , <unk> <unk> , where the problem is not that they have <unk> choice .
The problem is they have too <unk> .
So the <unk> that I 'm talking about is a <unk> <unk> of <unk> , <unk> society .
And what <unk> does <unk> and <unk> is this : <unk> <unk> talked about yesterday yesterday about how much the <unk> and <unk> <unk> to <unk> are <unk> . It 's a <unk> of money .
I mean , these choices , <unk> and <unk> , is not that they 're just <unk> .
They 're <unk> <unk> .
They do worse .
If a little bit of what we do do is that , in our society <unk> to be <unk> in the way , people have too few possibilities , it wouldn 't just be <unk> , but our <unk> .
This is what <unk> call a <unk> .
A <unk> of income does well for everybody -- not just the poor -- because of this choice in <unk> that we <unk> .
So , to <unk> : " <unk> , you can get everything you want to -- "
<unk> , people , <unk> , " What do you do that fish ? "
" It 's <unk> that you can 't make anything in a glass of glass . "
" A <unk> imagination , a <unk> vision of the world --
and I <unk> it so , at the beginning .
But then , <unk> , instead , I realized that that that fish knows it long .
Because the reality of the things is that if you <unk> the <unk> , so that it 's possible , " everything you can 't <unk> the freedom . You <unk> .
If you <unk> the <unk> so that it could <unk> the <unk> .
<unk> the <unk> , and <unk> <unk> .
Everybody needs a <unk> .
This is almost certainly too <unk> , maybe even for the fish , and certainly for the fish , and certainly for us .
But the <unk> of some <unk> <unk> is a <unk> for <unk> and , <unk> , for <unk> .
Thank you very much .
