The last year I showed these <unk> for <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> , which for almost three million years , it was the size of the United States , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
I <unk> this <unk> the <unk> of the problem because it 's not <unk> the ice <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> <unk> is , in a sense , the heart of the system of climate system .
They <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
The next <unk> is going to be a <unk> <unk> on the last 25 years .
<unk> <unk> are <unk> in red .
As you see , it <unk> up to the blue <unk> .
That 's the ice in <unk> , which is <unk> in summer .
You can see that the <unk> ice <unk> , five years or more , is like blood , which here <unk> from the body .
In 25 years , it 's been so , in 25 years .
This is a problem because the <unk> <unk> <unk> around the ocean where there are huge <unk> of <unk> that , <unk> are <unk> <unk> that , <unk> are <unk> in <unk> .
<unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> , the amount of <unk> , the amount of <unk> , <unk> this point of not .
In some <unk> <unk> in <unk> , the <unk> is already <unk> by the water .
The <unk> <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> ! <unk> : She 's good . The question is if we <unk> it also .
One reason is that this <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> from the north .
This is a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> had never <unk> <unk> <unk> .
This is the <unk> <unk> , in the <unk> of <unk> .
If you want to know how the sea level for the <unk> <unk> on <unk> , here is where we <unk> the sea .
These <unk> are <unk> .
<unk> other hand of the planet : <unk> , the largest <unk> of the planet .
<unk> month , the <unk> scientists who <unk> that the ice <unk> is in <unk> , and that <unk> <unk> <unk> , which <unk> on some <unk> <unk> , is particularly <unk> in the <unk> .
<unk> <unk> feet of the <unk> level , like <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , the <unk> third <unk> of ice , you see new <unk> , which a few years ago were <unk> .
<unk> percent of the world 's population <unk> water from the <unk> .
<unk> <unk> : this <unk> is the source of the water <unk> of this city .
<unk> is <unk> .
But when we <unk> , the same happens to the water .
<unk> California <unk> on the <unk> <unk> <unk> is <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> are in the crisis .
<unk> , as you read , they 're <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> in the world <unk> to a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> are <unk> to a normal <unk> out of the normal and <unk> .
<unk> times over the last 30 years than the <unk> <unk> .
This is a <unk> of the <unk> .
If you look at it in the <unk> context , if you can see the <unk> .
In the last five years , we 've been <unk> <unk> million <unk> in the oceans -- 25 million <unk> in the oceans every day .
Look at the <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and both <unk> , and both of the parts of the <unk> <unk> , where there 's a <unk> <unk> of oxygen in the oceans .
The biggest <unk> of the global <unk> , <unk> , which is 20 percent , is the use of <unk> <unk> .
The oil is a problem , and <unk> is even worse .
The United States is one of the two countries with <unk> emissions , together .
And they 're trying to build a lot of other <unk> .
But we 're <unk> to a <unk> of the way .
These are the <unk> projects over the last years and some <unk> <unk> <unk> .
At any way , there is a <unk> politics in our country .
The <unk> of <unk> and oil <unk> have <unk> <unk> million dollars in the last year to <unk> <unk> <unk> , which is a <unk> .
I <unk> image <unk> me .
<unk> <unk> , in <unk> , where I live , there was a <unk> of <unk> billion <unk> of <unk> .
Maybe you saw it on the <unk> .
This is the second largest flow of <unk> in America .
It 's happened around <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> of one of the <unk> was this .
<unk> : <unk> â™« <unk> <unk> <unk> is a <unk> guy .
It 's <unk> here in America , and it 's <unk> our economy .
<unk> <unk> is more <unk> .
It 's at good price , <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> here is a lot of <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The biggest <unk> society <unk> on the <unk> <unk> . This is his <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> <unk> -- <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , they <unk> <unk> -- they don 't know what they 're talking about .
<unk> : So the <unk> for the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
This is one of them , one part .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> , we see the changes <unk> as a <unk> <unk> to our business .
For that we <unk> a great amount of money in a <unk> <unk> to make public and <unk> the truth on <unk> .
In fact , <unk> is not <unk> .
We think it 's <unk> -- it also also a good <unk> .
So we don 't know about climate change .
We could do it .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> <unk> -- you 've heard a lot of it .
So I <unk> a <unk> in a <unk> structure as it 's about <unk> <unk> .
<unk> ! <unk> are a little bit , but this is the sound of the technology of <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> is between the main <unk> of the global <unk> , but the <unk> technology that you can see everything .

<unk> America : 100 percent of <unk> energy , in 10 years .
A plan for <unk> America to work , <unk> <unk> , and to help <unk> the global <unk> .
<unk> , a solution that we could solve our problems .
<unk> America . I 'm more .
<unk> : This is the last one .

<unk> : A old <unk> <unk> says , " If you want to go , go out to alone .
If you want to go far , you go together . "
We have to go far , quickly .
Thank you very much .
<unk> year at TED , I did a <unk> on <unk> .
And I try to <unk> about how the car works .
So , I was . And for those that the other time , there was the largest scientific experiment ever <unk> -- <unk> miles of <unk> .
His task is to <unk> the conditions that were there less than a <unk> of the universe -- until <unk> million times a second .
All that 's just <unk> .
This is the machine under <unk> .
I 'm going to <unk> these <unk> <unk> inside .
This is what I work . It 's called <unk> -- <unk> feet , and it 's got a <unk> <unk> feet .
This is a <unk> image of <unk> in this <unk> . You can see the <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> of last year we <unk> the machine for the first time .
And this picture was <unk> by <unk> .
It was <unk> <unk> in control .
It 's an image of the first <unk> of particles that had done all the <unk> , <unk> in <unk> , <unk> , with a part of the <unk> , and we <unk> particles inside the <unk> .
In other words , when you <unk> this image 10 <unk> , you know , the <unk> machine , which is a great <unk> .
I don 't know if it was this to <unk> us to be more or this , when somebody <unk> on Google and I <unk> that the page was this .
That means that we 've had a <unk> impact beyond the scientific .
<unk> a week later , there was a problem with the machine , just to these <unk> here -- these <unk> <unk> .
These <unk> <unk> <unk> when the car works at the <unk> <unk> .
Now , <unk> between you 're <unk> and <unk> , " I 'm not true . I 'm too <unk> . "
And they can do it because when they 're very <unk> , they can get the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
So , at least <unk> degrees , at a temperature <unk> at the stars , these <unk> can bring that <unk> .
In one of the most <unk> <unk> in the <unk> , there was a <unk> <unk> .
So the <unk> <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a electric <unk> .
This was the result .
Now , this is even more <unk> if you think that these <unk> <unk> <unk> , and that 's <unk> about 30 <unk> .
They were about 50 <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , what we did .
We <unk> them and <unk> .
Now they 're all <unk> to their <unk> place .
<unk> the end of <unk> the <unk> is going to be again .
We <unk> it , and we <unk> to get data <unk> or <unk> , and we continue so our <unk> to discover what the universe are <unk> that <unk> the universe .
Now , of course , in some way , these <unk> <unk> the <unk> on the <unk> of science and engineering engineering <unk> . It 's easy to <unk> .
I think the fact that 's so hard , the fact of <unk> , I think it 's the value of things like <unk> .
I want to end with the words of a <unk> <unk> , which , <unk> <unk> , which , in <unk> of the <unk> experiments of his <unk> , his <unk> was Michael <unk> , he said , " No , <unk> <unk> . It 's so <unk> to the progress of the human mind as the <unk> that we have <unk> in nature , that we don 't have <unk> in nature , that we have <unk> .
Thank you .
I want to talk about <unk> to when , from children , <unk> , <unk> with <unk> .
<unk> <unk> like <unk> and <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , actually , to actually think and <unk> problems .
The <unk> <unk> is <unk> <unk> to the way that we <unk> the world around us .
So , from <unk> <unk> from the <unk> of our <unk> with <unk> objects , and my <unk> <unk> , and my <unk> <unk> <unk> , and I started to <unk> , " And if we use a computer , instead of having the only <unk> <unk> as a digital <unk> , and then , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> as a digital <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> on a <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
and we start to our <unk> ?
The question was so interesting that we tried to explore the answer , building <unk> .
In a few words , a <unk> is a <unk> computer as a <unk> .
In a few words , a <unk> is a <unk> computer as a <unk> .
You can <unk> them with the hand , they can <unk> them with their own <unk> , feel the movement and they have a screen and a <unk> .
But <unk> , they 're <unk> objects , like <unk> , you can just <unk> <unk> .
<unk> is the example of a new <unk> of tools for <unk> information .
And as they become more <unk> , <unk> of the <unk> movement , other , and they 're more <unk> , <unk> of the <unk> of their <unk> , and they can explore and <unk> <unk> of <unk> .
Let me start with some simple example .
This <unk> is <unk> to show you about the video : if you <unk> it in a direction , the video <unk> so , if we go back to the other side .
These <unk> <unk> are <unk> of others .
If you <unk> them , it 's <unk> to what they 're around .
If they 're <unk> , they can <unk> it and they can <unk> it a little bit .
If they 're <unk> , they can <unk> it and they can <unk> it a little bit .
They also <unk> their movement and <unk> .
We then realized that one of the interesting <unk> of the <unk> was the <unk> that we could use common <unk> on data , for example , " <unk> , " <unk> <unk> . " <unk> a color as if it was a <unk> .
In this case , we have three <unk> <unk> like <unk> and I can <unk> to <unk> of color in the central one , where you 're <unk> .
and I can <unk> to <unk> of color in the central one , where you 're <unk> .
If you get too much , we can <unk> it a little bit of a place .
I also <unk> possibilities , like <unk> , how <unk> , mathematics and games where people can try and <unk> things that are going to try things quickly , and they <unk> the <unk> immediately .
Now , I 'm ...
This is a <unk> <unk> that I do with a <unk> program .
Here we have a <unk> game .
<unk> , at every <unk> <unk> a letter to be <unk> on every <unk> , <unk> , at every <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> a letter on every <unk> , and while I was <unk> <unk> <unk> on a <unk> .
Then , after about 30 seconds , you get a new <unk> of <unk> and new possibilities to try .
Thank you .
Here 's <unk> <unk> <unk> , I made it in the <unk> <unk> , I made them a video .
They are very <unk> .
And one of the interesting things of this kind of <unk> is that you don 't have to <unk> people .
I just said , " I 'm <unk> of the words , and they know exactly what to do .
Here 's other people who <unk> him .
This is our <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , there on the right .
It just wanted to <unk> .
They were only <unk> , for him .
Now , this is a <unk> of a <unk> <unk> .
He <unk> to build a tool for the <unk> . He 's <unk> .
It can <unk> new characters in the scene , <unk> their <unk> .
It can <unk> new characters in the scene , <unk> their <unk> .
So here 's what 's doing .
<unk> : The sun is <unk> .
David <unk> : Now , he brought a <unk> in the scene .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> .
<unk> ! Yeah !
So , we <unk> <unk> and <unk> can make the characters --
<unk> : <unk> !
<unk> their story .
<unk> : <unk> !
<unk> : It 's a story with the final story , and it can decide how it <unk> .
<unk> : It 's a story with the final story , and it can decide how it <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> away , <unk> .
<unk> : The last example I have time to show you is a <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> music .
It 's a recent tool , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> music .
The <unk> <unk> here from <unk> as the bottom and the <unk> .
<unk> of these has four different <unk> , and you can choose which to use .
You can also <unk> these <unk> in a <unk> <unk> .
And I just <unk> by doing a <unk> <unk> , and a <unk> .
These are effects that you can control alive , like <unk> and <unk> .
I <unk> it to a particular sound , and then <unk> for <unk> .
And then there are the effects of time and <unk> , who <unk> to the entire sequence .
<unk> how it works .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> <unk> a series of <unk> , " <unk> in a series , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> another base .
Now , I 'm going to take a <unk> line .
<unk> : <unk> : Now , I <unk> <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> : And now I 'm going to <unk> the <unk> , so I can control the effect of the alive .
<unk> : <unk> : I can <unk> the entire <unk> <unk> the time on one side or another .
<unk> : <unk> : And now we 're going to <unk> the bottom to give more <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> , I can <unk> the <unk> <unk> .
So I don 't have to <unk> , but I can <unk> it , <unk> over and <unk> .
And now , finally , I can <unk> the whole <unk> <unk> on the left <unk> . "
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is to build new <unk> <unk> <unk> to how our brain work work and body .
And today , I 've had time to show you one of the results of this way , and also some possibilities that we try to bring out of the lab .
The concept that I want to tell you is that it 's going to be <unk> this new generation of <unk> objects that we want to <unk> information in our world that we want .
Thank you very much .
I don 't see the time to talk to all of you .
I 'm a <unk> .
<unk> books is my <unk> , but it 's more than this , of course .
It 's also love and <unk> of my life .
And I don 't think it can change .
But , I said this , something particular happened in my life and my career , who <unk> me to <unk> the whole relationship with this work .
The particular thing is I <unk> wrote this book , this <unk> called " <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , " which I <unk> " the <unk> , " which I <unk> from my <unk> books , for some reason to the world and <unk> a big , <unk> <unk> .
And the result is that it 's everywhere , now , people <unk> me as if I was <unk> .
<unk> -- <unk> , <unk> !
I 'm going to be <unk> and they say , " You don 't fear to be able to do better than you know ?
You don 't fear to keep going to write for all the life without any more to be able to create a book that can <unk> to somebody ? "
that can you get to somebody ? "
It 's <unk> , you know .
But it could go worse , and then I remember that over 20 years ago , when I was saying to people -- I was a <unk> -- I wanted to be a <unk> .
I 'm going to talk to the same <unk> <unk> .
And people said , " Don 't you know I don 't have successful ?
You don 't fear that the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> ?
You don 't fear to do this <unk> for all the life without anything that you ever have out and die on a <unk> of <unk> <unk> ? "
So , you know .
The answer -- the short answer to all these questions is , " Yes . "
Yes , I fear of all those things .
I 've always had fear .
And I 'm also a lot of other things that people can 't be <unk> .
As <unk> and other things <unk> .
But , how I thought , and I thought , and I 'm going to <unk> me is why ?
Is it <unk> ?
It 's <unk> that anybody who <unk> <unk> to be <unk> by a job that you feel born for doing .
But there 's so particular in the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> about health <unk> <unk> <unk> in a way that other <unk> don 't do ?
As my father , for example , he was a <unk> and I don 't remember one time in his 40 years of activity where he was asked to be <unk> <unk> ?
It was never -- that <unk> of John , how do you ?
<unk> 't that , <unk> ?
<unk> , the engineers like <unk> as a group , they don 't certainly , in <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
We <unk> , we have this <unk> , and not only <unk> , but <unk> of all sorts of kinds of <unk> , we have this <unk> to be <unk> <unk> .
And not to be another that look at the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that , only in the <unk> century , <unk> young and often to their own .
And the ones who don 't seem to be <unk> by their <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , before he died , in the last <unk> , said , " Every book has <unk> me a little bit of a little bit more , " One extraordinary <unk> about the work .
But we don 't <unk> <unk> when we say , because we 've heard these things so long that in some way we have completely <unk> and <unk> the <unk> that creativity and <unk> are in some way <unk> and <unk> the art , finally , <unk> always <unk> .
And the question I want to tell you all here is , you 're <unk> with this idea ?
<unk> <unk> to me . It 's why it also <unk> by a <unk> distance to me , it 's not good for this <unk> .
I think it 's <unk> .
And I think it 's also <unk> , and I don 't want to <unk> up in the next century .
I think it 's better <unk> our great <unk> to live .
And I certainly know , in my case -- it would be very <unk> to start to <unk> to the <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in which I 'm in my career .
<unk> -- <unk> , look at a young <unk> , I 've been about 40 years .
I still have about four <unk> of work in me .
And it 's very <unk> that anything that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> from the world like the work that I <unk> after the <unk> of my last book .
<unk> <unk> , because we 're all more or less friends here -- is <unk> that my greatest success is to my <unk> .
Oh , <unk> , who thought !
You know , this is the kind of thought that brings a person to nine <unk> at the nine of the morning and I don 't want to do it .
I love .
So , the question becomes , how ?
And so it looks like , after a lot of <unk> , that the way to work to keep <unk> is what to create a <unk> <unk> , OK ?
I have to find a <unk> distance between me , which I 'm <unk> , and my natural <unk> on which is going to be <unk> . And as we <unk> for all last year , how to do we <unk> to look through the time , looking at the time , looking at the time , to find other society to see if you have better ideas and more <unk> .
about how to help people <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of creativity .
And that research has brought to the <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> because I went back to <unk> and then <unk> back .
<unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> -- people don 't believe that creativity <unk> <unk> from men , OK ?
It <unk> that creativity was this <unk> spirit <unk> and <unk> to men from a few <unk> <unk> and <unk> , for reasons and <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> <unk> these <unk> <unk> <unk> of creativity .
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> to have a <unk> that <unk> <unk> from far .
The <unk> were the same idea , but they <unk> the spirit of the body .
which is <unk> , because the <unk> didn 't really <unk> that a <unk> was somebody particularly .
I thought that a <unk> was this kind of <unk> <unk> that would literally be in the <unk> of a artist , a little <unk> , and that <unk> out of <unk> the <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> <unk> the work of the artist and <unk> the result of that work .
<unk> <unk> , here 's the distance of which I talk -- that <unk> <unk> you <unk> from the results of your work .
And everyone <unk> that was so that it was so that we <unk> , right ?
So , the artists were <unk> by <unk> things , like the <unk> <unk> , right ?
If your work was <unk> not <unk> <unk> all the <unk> , everybody <unk> that <unk> was <unk> by this <unk> <unk> .
If your work <unk> , it wasn 't all <unk> your , right ?
Everybody <unk> that was your <unk> to be a <unk> .
And so people <unk> <unk> <unk> creativity in <unk> for a long time .
Then the <unk> <unk> and all <unk> , and we <unk> this big idea ; we put the human in the center of the universe above all the universe and the center of <unk> and <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and
This was the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> and people started thinking that creativity <unk> completely from the <unk> .
And for the first time in history , it <unk> to <unk> this or that artist as a <unk> <unk> <unk> that to a <unk> that to a person with <unk> .
And I have to say , I think it was a big <unk> .
I think it 's a simple person to believe that it 's like a <unk> like the source , the source and the <unk> of all the <unk> <unk> , <unk> and <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> is a <unk> <unk> .
It 's like <unk> to someone to <unk> the sun .
<unk> and <unk> completely <unk> the <unk> and creates all these <unk> <unk> on the <unk> .
And I think it was this pressure to have <unk> artists in <unk> 500 years .
And , if this is true , and I think it 's , the question becomes , and now ?
Can we do it ?
<unk> to be <unk> <unk> of human relationship between humans and <unk> <unk> .
Or maybe not .
Maybe we can 't <unk> 500 years of thinking in a talk about 18 minutes .
And there 's probably people in the audience who <unk> <unk> <unk> on the <unk> of , <unk> , you do do <unk> people <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> on their projects .
<unk> 't you all about this thing .
But the question I 'd like to tell you is -- why ?
Why not <unk> this way ?
Because it has more sense of every other thing that ever heard about the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> process .
One process that , as anyone who ever <unk> to do something -- so , basically , everybody -- knows here -- you don 't know .
And in fact , it can be completely <unk> .
I 've done this <unk> <unk> with the extraordinary <unk> <unk> , who 's been <unk> , but who was a <unk> for all of life and said that during his <unk> <unk> , and he said that during his <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> out in the <unk> , and he <unk> it , in the <unk> <unk> .
He said it was like a <unk> <unk> .
And that I was <unk> <unk> to her <unk> .
I <unk> it up , because he was <unk> the earth under his feet .
I decided to have one thing to do at that point and he was , he was , his <unk> as a <unk> . "
And so he was <unk> by this <unk> , and it wouldn 't have to do anything else that would have a piece of paper and a <unk> enough <unk> , and it <unk> and <unk> on the page .
<unk> times not to be <unk> enough , so <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> through and she would <unk> the <unk> through and she would <unk> the <unk> and she would <unk> it up with the <unk> , looking for , and how she said , " another <unk> . "
Then there was those times -- this piece never <unk> -- there was no time , there was almost times when he was <unk> , OK ?
So , he was <unk> home and he was looking at home and the <unk> <unk> through , and he was a <unk> in their <unk> , and he was <unk> in the while he was <unk> , and he was <unk> up .
<unk> the tail <unk> from the tail and the <unk> in his body and the <unk> on the page .
And in these cases , the <unk> would be <unk> on the page <unk> , but the <unk> <unk> <unk> to the last word to the first .
So when I <unk> <unk> -- it 's <unk> , it 's <unk> , it 's <unk> to my <unk> process .
I don 't have my <unk> process -- I 'm not a <unk> !
I 'm a <unk> , and my way to <unk> is ; I <unk> at the same <unk> every day and work and work and work and <unk> over it .
But even me , in my <unk> , I <unk> against that thing , sometimes .
And I think , many of you <unk> it .
You know , even if the work and ideas <unk> me <unk> from a source , I couldn 't <unk> <unk> .
And what is this thing ?
And how can we <unk> it in a way that we don 't lose your head , but , what would you do <unk> <unk> ?
For the best example I 've been the best example I have is the <unk> <unk> <unk> , which I <unk> <unk> , which I <unk> a different <unk> .
<unk> of this , and you know , <unk> , for the <unk> of life was the <unk> artist <unk> , trying to control , <unk> <unk> , <unk> these <unk> <unk> <unk> .
But then he <unk> , and a day , and a day while he was <unk> on a <unk> <unk> <unk> , he <unk> it <unk> it all over for him .
<unk> <unk> , and all of a <unk> <unk> this little <unk> of <unk> , who comes into his head as <unk> <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , and it wants , and the <unk> , and the <unk> , and you want , but not how to <unk> .
It 's not a piece of paper , it 's not a <unk> , it doesn 't have a <unk> .
So he starts to hear this kind of old <unk> <unk> , and he said , " I 'm going to lose , and <unk> <unk> by this song .
I 'm not enough <unk> , and I can 't <unk> . "
And instead of going to go to the <unk> , they <unk> .
<unk> the whole process <unk> process and <unk> something completely new .
He just <unk> the sky and said , " <unk> , you don 't see that I 'm <unk> ? "
" It seems to you a song now ?
If you really want to <unk> , you 're going to be <unk> when I can take care of you .
<unk> , <unk> to <unk> another today .
I was going to <unk> <unk> . "
And the process of his <unk> <unk> process after this .
I didn 't work , it was still <unk> as always .
But the process , and the <unk> <unk> that <unk> was <unk> when he <unk> the <unk> , the <unk> that outside he was , the <unk> that outside , the <unk> that 's where it was , he <unk> that he was <unk> , he <unk> that he was <unk> , that it didn 't have to be a <unk> and <unk> .
But I <unk> this <unk> , wonderful <unk> <unk> a conversation between <unk> and this thing <unk> , but it wasn 't <unk> .
So , as a <unk> <unk> to change a little bit of the way I <unk> and I 've already <unk> me a time .
This idea , I was when I was <unk> , " <unk> , " and I said , " and I was in one of the <unk> of the <unk> that we 're working on something , and you can think it 's going to be a <unk> , that 's going to be the book .
Not only <unk> , the <unk> book .
And I started thinking about <unk> this project .
But then I <unk> to <unk> that <unk> to the air and <unk> us .
So I <unk> my face on the <unk> and <unk> my <unk> to a <unk> <unk> of the room .
And I said to <unk> <unk> , what , you know , both , you know that if this book is not going to be <unk> my , right ?
Because , as you see I 'm <unk> everything I have , I don 't have more than this .
So if you want it 's better , you have to <unk> and do your part .
OK . But if you don 't do it , you know what , I don 't do anything .
<unk> to write the same because it 's my work .
And I would like to be <unk> that I 've been <unk> to do my part . " Because it 's so , then , OK -- <unk> does in the <unk> of Africa , the people <unk> to <unk> <unk> to the <unk> <unk> to the <unk> of the moon , <unk> music , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> .
And they were always <unk> , because the <unk> were <unk> and they were <unk> .
But every <unk> , <unk> , something <unk> , and one of these <unk> artists actually <unk> .
And I know what I 'm talking about , because I know you 've got it , at a certain point , a <unk> .
It was like the time , and the <unk> <unk> through a kind of <unk> and he was <unk> through a kind of <unk> , and it was <unk> .
And it 's a sudden , not only as a human .
But it <unk> from the <unk> and <unk> in the <unk> fire .
And when this <unk> , at the time , people <unk> what was , he <unk> with his name .
<unk> <unk> , <unk> , " <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , God , God , " God , " God , " God , "
That 's God , you know .
<unk> <unk> -- when the <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> , <unk> this <unk> with their and <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , " <unk> , " <unk> , " <unk> , " <unk> , " which you can hear in the <unk> or <unk> .
In <unk> , when a artist has a <unk> of <unk> and <unk> , " <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk>
And it 's <unk> because we need .
But , the problem comes after the day , for the same <unk> , when you <unk> and <unk> that are 11 <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> of God is not more .
It 's just a great <unk> <unk> to <unk> , and maybe never <unk> to <unk> that <unk> .
And maybe nobody <unk> the name of God still , and what 's it must do with the rest of his life ?
It 's hard .
This is one of the most <unk> <unk> to do in a <unk> life .
But maybe it 's not to be so <unk> if you can 't believe , <unk> , that the most <unk> <unk> of your being being being being being being being being being being being being being being being <unk> .
But I just <unk> you get data in <unk> from a source of this <unk> part of the <unk> of your life that you have to <unk> .
And , you know , if we think about this way changes .
And so I started to <unk> , and it 's <unk> like I <unk> for several months in the <unk> of the book that I 'll be <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> of my <unk> .
And what I have to go to <unk> when I feel <unk> from this is , I don 't fear .
<unk> : I just don 't <unk> your work .
<unk> to <unk> for your side , any could be .
If your work is <unk> , <unk> .
If the <unk> , you 're <unk> <unk> to you <unk> some kind of <unk> , for only a moment through your <unk> , then , " <unk> ! "
<unk> , you do the same your <unk> .
And " <unk> ! " <unk> ! "
I think , and I think it 's <unk> .
" <unk> ! " <unk> ! " <unk> , even for having had love and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Thank you .
Thank you .
<unk> <unk> : <unk> !
As I 've been talking about some of these projects on the human genome , what can <unk> and the discovery of new <unk> .
Now we 're <unk> a new way : we started to <unk> biology and now starting from that digital code to start with that digital code , <unk> and <unk> life .
We 've always been looking for big questions .
" <unk> is life ? " It 's something that many <unk> , I think they 're <unk> to various levels .
We tried different <unk> , <unk> to the <unk> terms .
We 're <unk> by almost 20 years .
When we <unk> the human genome <unk> to go from the world of biology in the digital world of the computer .
Now , we can <unk> life , or create new life from this digital universe ?
This is the map of a little <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , which is the species from the <unk> genome between the <unk> that can <unk> in the lab .
And we tried to reduce the genome to <unk> a little bit more <unk> .
We can <unk> a <unk> of the <unk> of about 500 that are here .
But when we look at his <unk> map , it 's <unk> simple than our .
<unk> , this is simple .
But when we look at all the genes that we can <unk> , one at the time , it 's very <unk> that this can bring up a <unk> cell .
So I thought the only way to <unk> was <unk> this <unk> so that we could <unk> <unk> the <unk> for some of these questions .
And so we started the <unk> of " Can we <unk> a <unk> ? "
Can we make chemistry <unk> to produce these big molecules that we never have to create these before ?
And , in case , we can we make a <unk> ?
A <unk> is just a piece of <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The speed that we 're able to <unk> life is <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Our ability to write the <unk> code , instead , <unk> <unk> , but it 's <unk> .
And our most <unk> results <unk> <unk> <unk> .
We 've <unk> more than 15 years ago .
The process has <unk> a lot of <unk> , <unk> with a <unk> <unk> before we <unk> the early experiments .
But we found that <unk> of DNA is very hard .
There 's <unk> of thousands of cars in the world that <unk> <unk> , <unk> of 30 <unk> <unk> and it 's a <unk> process : the <unk> <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> . It 's a <unk> process , the <unk> is the <unk> , the <unk> is over there .
So we had to develop a new way to <unk> these <unk> and <unk> the <unk> .
And this was our first <unk> , starting from information information <unk> of the genome <unk> <unk> .
It 's a little virus that bacteria <unk> .
We designed <unk> , <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> and <unk> a <unk> of DNA <unk> <unk> .
The interesting part is when we took this piece of <unk> <unk> <unk> and we <unk> it in bacteria , the bacteria have <unk> to read this code code , and <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> particles have been <unk> by cells , they 're <unk> back and they <unk> <unk> <unk> .
I talked about recently with members of the <unk> <unk> <unk> that they have of this model .
They have more than you .
I think this is a situation where the software can actually build his own <unk> in a <unk> system .
But let 's do things in big .
It 's going to build the whole <unk> of the <unk> .
I 'm more than <unk> <unk> <unk> .
So we thought about <unk> in the size of the virus , so that we can change the <unk> to understand what the <unk> of a <unk> cell .
<unk> is <unk> , and if we <unk> information in a computer , these must be very <unk> .
When we <unk> this genome for the first time in the <unk> <unk> was a <unk> for every 10 <unk> <unk> .
We found , <unk> , 30 <unk> . If we used that original <unk> never been able to do it work .
One of the process is to design <unk> <unk> 50 <unk> that <unk> with all the other <unk> 50 <unk> to build little little <unk> that <unk> together .
<unk> elements here .
You probably read that we 've been <unk> to the <unk> .
<unk> : We have a <unk> code on four <unk> : A , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> and <unk>
<unk> of those <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and there 's a <unk> order to <unk> every <unk> .
So we can use the code for <unk> words , <unk> , <unk> .
What we did at the beginning was <unk> .
Some of them were <unk> by the fact that it wasn 't <unk> .
We designed these <unk> to just <unk> with <unk> .
There are <unk> that we <unk> them and <unk> <unk> .
And we started to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
But at every step we made these <unk> in <unk> so that we 're <unk> that we 're trying to create a very <unk> <unk> <unk> , which we 're going to create a very <unk> <unk> .
We 're trying to <unk> the process .
So , this seems to be the <unk> of a <unk> .
When I started these <unk> <unk> , a lot of 100 <unk> <unk> , they don 't get <unk> directly to the <unk> <unk> .
You get to the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> biology .
So we 've <unk> other <unk> .
<unk> of another <unk> called <unk> <unk> , who in biology <unk> to <unk> DNA , which can <unk> the <unk> .
Here 's an example .
This <unk> , called <unk> <unk> , can <unk> three million <unk> <unk> .
You can see in the <unk> <unk> as his <unk> is <unk> .
<unk> <unk> -- 24 hours , it 's <unk> exactly like it was before .
<unk> thousands of organisms that are able to do this .
These organisms can completely <unk> .
It 's going to be <unk> .
I 'm absolutely sure that life <unk> in space , and they <unk> to find new <unk> of water .
<unk> , NASA <unk> showed that this is .
This is a picture of the <unk> that we 've built these <unk> , just using the <unk> with the <unk> design <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> <unk> .
This image was not <unk> with a <unk> <unk> , but with a <unk> <unk> .
It 's a <unk> so big <unk> that we can <unk> with a <unk> <unk> .
These are pictures that <unk> a period of about six seconds .
This is the <unk> that we 've done a little time ago .
I 'm more than <unk> <unk> code .
It 's the largest <unk> of a <unk> <unk> .
It has a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
If you <unk> it with a <unk> 10 without spaces , we just <unk> pages for <unk> this code .
Now , how do we work ?
<unk> , through a virus is a <unk> game .
It 's a little bit more <unk> when you 're using bacteria .
It 's <unk> even when it 's about <unk> cells like our : you just <unk> the <unk> and <unk> another , which is basically the <unk> process .
In <unk> , the <unk> <unk> is <unk> in the cell , but we <unk> <unk> that we can do a <unk> <unk> that we are able to do a <unk> <unk> of a cell to another and <unk> .
We <unk> a <unk> <unk> from a species .
<unk> are different as men from <unk> .
We <unk> some <unk> in more <unk> way to decide what this <unk> .
He <unk> it up with the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And when we put it in the cell was <unk> and <unk> our <unk> <unk> the new <unk> went into the <unk> .
And I thought that we didn 't go beyond , but we tried to <unk> it up in there .
This is one of the major <unk> of evolution .
We found that <unk> species have <unk> a second or a third <unk> somewhere , <unk> in a second thousands of new <unk> to that species .
So who think about evolution as a only <unk> at the time it <unk> has no <unk> of biology .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> that was in the cell <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> that we 've <unk> it .
It 's <unk> , and he <unk> the other <unk> as a <unk> material , and we <unk> it with only the cell and the new <unk> .
It 's become blue because of the genes that we <unk> .
And in a short <unk> of time , all the <unk> of a species are <unk> , and it 's <unk> of the whole new software , <unk> on the new software , which we <unk> in the cell .
All the <unk> are <unk> , and the <unk> are <unk> , and when you <unk> the code <unk> , and when you get the code that we 've <unk> .
Now , this could be <unk> <unk> , but we <unk> the software , we can change things in a <unk> way .
Now , I 've already <unk> that 's not talking about <unk> -- but <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> , and <unk> , and I said that maybe we are going to create a new version of the <unk> <unk> that we <unk> new <unk> on this process .
Why do that ?
I think it 's pretty <unk> when we think of our <unk> .
We 're going to go from six and a half billion in the next 40 years .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> . I was born in <unk> .
Now there are three people on the planet to <unk> in the <unk> ; in 40 years , there will be four .
We 're <unk> problems now to find food , <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> for six billion people .
We 're even more <unk> to do it for nine billion .
<unk> more than five billion <unk> , more than 30 billion <unk> .
That means 100 million <unk> a day .
When we try to find <unk> <unk> , or any kind of <unk> process , it will be a huge challenge .
In more we have to realize all the <unk> of CO2 <unk> from these materials that <unk> in the atmosphere .
At day , because of the <unk> <unk> <unk> around the world , we have a <unk> with about 20 of genes , and I like to think that are the <unk> <unk> for the future .
The <unk> industry only <unk> about a <unk> , and think about how many different things are out .
Our <unk> here are <unk> data from the <unk> reality and our imagination .
Now we have <unk> , because of these <unk> <unk> <unk> , able to create what we call <unk> <unk> <unk> .
We can make a big robot that can produce a million <unk> a day .
And think about <unk> these 20 million different <unk> or try to <unk> the <unk> to produce <unk> or <unk> , new <unk> , we can change , because of a little team , and create more biology <unk> now that in the last 20 years of science .
And it 's just a standard <unk> .
We can choose to <unk> <unk> , chemistry or <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
This is a <unk> of some software <unk> that we 're working on to be able to <unk> and design species at the computers .
Well , we don 't know how they 're going to be .
We know exactly what their <unk> code .
Now we 're <unk> on the <unk> <unk> .
You 've seen you who <unk> from the <unk> was a <unk> experiment .
We have <unk> <unk> , and third generation that we had enough to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> or different <unk> of <unk> .
But the only way that biology can have a big impact without <unk> the cost of food and <unk> the cost of the food and <unk> the <unk> would be <unk> the CO2 in matter before , where we 're working for <unk> cells that can reach this purpose , and we think we can have the first <unk> <unk> of <unk> generation in about 18 months .
The <unk> <unk> with CO2 is a <unk> , but in our <unk> <unk> around the world , we found different <unk> .
This is a <unk> that we <unk> in <unk> .
<unk> in the deep ocean , about <unk> feet at the temperature of <unk> water .
<unk> <unk> from CO2 using hydrogen <unk> as hydrogen <unk> as hydrogen .
We 're trying to figure out whether we can <unk> the CO2 , which can be <unk> through <unk> , <unk> that CO2 in <unk> , to drive this process .
So , we think we could be able to <unk> what the <unk> question of " which is what is life . We <unk> we have the <unk> <unk> of <unk> the entire <unk> industry .
<unk> . If you can 't do it from TED , where you can 't do it from TED , where you can 't do it from TED , where you can 't do it from TED , where you can 't do it from TED , where you can 't do it from TED , where you can 't do it from TED , where you can 't do it from TED , where you can 't do it from TED .
It 's a main source of energy .
<unk> , we 're working for using the same <unk> to create <unk> .
You saw this year with flu , we 're always back a year and with a dollar in less when it 's about finding the right <unk> .
I think what you can change the <unk> building <unk> <unk> .
Here 's how the future could start to look like <unk> , now , the tree of evolution , <unk> the evolution with bacteria , <unk> and then <unk> cells .
We 're at so <unk> people .
Our purpose is to do in a way to live enough . Thank you very long .
First of all , I 'll show you , the <unk> possible , some <unk> work , new technology that we brought up to <unk> <unk> to a <unk> <unk> <unk> to a year ago . This is <unk> .
It 's a environment where you can <unk> is <unk> to local level that <unk> with a huge amount of data .
Here we 're looking at <unk> <unk> <unk> with a kind of <unk> <unk> and <unk> , for a fast <unk> , <unk> the images as we want .
And it doesn 't matter how big the amount of information that we see , how big these <unk> of data or images .
Most of them are common photographs , but this for example is a <unk> <unk> by the <unk> of the <unk> , and they <unk> in the <unk> of 300 <unk> .
It doesn 't make any difference because the only thing that <unk> the <unk> of a system like this is the number of <unk> on your screen at any moment . It 's also a very <unk> architecture .
This is a whole book , example of data not images .
This is <unk> <unk> <unk> . Every <unk> is a <unk> .
For <unk> that it 's about the text and not <unk> , we can do something like that , to see that 's a real <unk> of the text , not a picture .
It could be a way to read a little book .
I don 't tell you .
This is an <unk> example . This is a <unk> number of <unk> .
Every image is the beginning of a <unk> .
And it really gives you the pleasure and the <unk> experience of reading the real version of a <unk> or a <unk> , which is for nature a <unk> .
We also did something with the corner of this , in particular <unk> .
We created a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . And we 've <unk> a normal <unk> , and we <unk> <unk> of the content content .
If you want to see the <unk> of this <unk> , you can see here .
Or other models , or even <unk> <unk> .
And this really <unk> some of these ideas to <unk> the <unk> of space on the screen .
I think this <unk> <unk> to <unk> and other <unk> <unk> <unk> , not <unk> to be <unk> .
Of course , the <unk> is one of the most <unk> <unk> for this kind of technology .
And on this <unk> , I don 't want to lose time , if we don 't say that we have <unk> to give you a <unk> in this field .
These are all the <unk> in the United States <unk> over a <unk> image .
So now I started to something else .
This is actually in the Web . You can <unk> it .
This is a project called <unk> , which <unk> two different technologies .
One is <unk> and the other is a <unk> <unk> to the computer a very interesting <unk> <unk> , a student of the <unk> <unk> , a student of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . <unk> . A <unk> <unk> .
And it 's alive on the Web , <unk> <unk> .
You can see when we do this kind of <unk> , where we can <unk> from one image to another and have this kind of experience <unk> .
But the <unk> <unk> of the images here actually , a meaning .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> on the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> on the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> on the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . <unk> are <unk> . And here you see some of the elements of a <unk> <unk> , and these things are all <unk> <unk> .
I don 't know if I have time to show you some other environment .
There 's a lot more <unk> .
I want to go directly to one of the <unk> data and this <unk> from a <unk> <unk> <unk> that we 've done for the first time , I was going to show you what we did is really the key behind this technology , the <unk> technology . And it 's not <unk> <unk> . And it 's not <unk> <unk> . And it 's not <unk> <unk> <unk> . And it 's not <unk> <unk> <unk> . And it 's not <unk> <unk> <unk> . And it 's not <unk> <unk> <unk> .
We had to <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
This is a <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> of <unk> and <unk> <unk> . And he <unk> of these <unk> <unk> <unk> . He <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
So , I 'm all <unk> <unk> <unk> and they 're all <unk> to the way .
And it 's possible to <unk> this way .
You know , I would never have thought about work for <unk> .
It 's very <unk> <unk> this kind of <unk> here .
I think I think you 're a lot of different kinds of <unk> : from the <unk> of the cell cell <unk> <unk> , a number , <unk> <unk> , a number <unk> , <unk> together in this environment .
And if I can , I can <unk> to look at the <unk> .
A lot of them are <unk> , etc . .
<unk> here is a series of photographs -- <unk> .
This is a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
We can go from the physics to physics of this environment .
The <unk> point is that we can do things with social environment . This is now <unk> data from the whole memory memory of how to <unk> the earth , from the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> all that data together .
All those pictures become <unk> together , more than the <unk> .
You have a model of the entire Earth .
Think about this as the <unk> of the work <unk> on Earth .
It 's something that <unk> in <unk> <unk> of the people who <unk> it , and the <unk> that we 're going to be <unk> with the use .
Their pictures are <unk> with other people .
If somebody comes the idea of <unk> all these <unk> <unk> the name , my <unk> picture of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> all of this data , and I can use how a <unk> <unk> to <unk> in that space , using the <unk> of <unk> , using the pictures of anyone else , and have a social experience .
Of course , a <unk> of all this is <unk> <unk> and <unk> of every interesting part of the earth , <unk> not only by <unk> and <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
Thank you .
Chris Anderson : I realized what 's going to do is that ? What your software will you do is that at some point , in the next years , all the pictures <unk> that we could be <unk> <unk> together ?
<unk> : Yeah . What 's doing is basically , it 's <unk> .
It 's creating <unk> , if you want , between pictures .
And he 's <unk> it 's <unk> .
The thing becomes very interesting if you think about the <unk> of information that many of these <unk> <unk> .
As you do a <unk> <unk> on the web , you <unk> a <unk> and the text on the page is a lot of information about pictures .
Now , what happens if that picture is it <unk> to all your picture ?
So the amount of <unk> <unk> and the amount of <unk> that 's really huge . It 's a <unk> effect of the network .
CA : <unk> , it 's really amazing . <unk> .
<unk> : I 'm going to tell you a lot .
One of the main <unk> when you <unk> and one of the <unk> research is the can live between who has not <unk> <unk> , who <unk> the past the wind , the <unk> <unk> <unk> from the <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> to think that <unk> <unk> still <unk> over the <unk> <unk> , or the <unk> <unk> are still <unk> <unk> , or that in <unk> , or <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> , to <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> , and the idea that the world that we live in in sense , but it 's only a <unk> model , but only is just a <unk> of a <unk> model , but it 's just a <unk> model ,
the <unk> of a particular <unk> of <unk> choices that our <unk> did , or bad , a lot of <unk> .
And , of course , they all <unk> <unk> .
Everybody <unk> . Everybody <unk> .
We 're <unk> to <unk> <unk> .
We have to <unk> the <unk> of death , so we don 't have to do it and <unk> --
We all have an art .
What <unk> is the particular <unk> of the song , the <unk> of <unk> of every culture .
It doesn 't matter that are the <unk> of the <unk> , or the <unk> of <unk> , or the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , or the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , or a <unk> in the heart of <unk> .
He was my <unk> of journey in <unk> a month ago , or a <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of <unk> , the <unk> 's <unk> , the <unk> mother of the world .
All these <unk> <unk> us that there are other ways of <unk> other ways of thinking , other ways to move into the world .
And , if you look at a moment , it 's a concept that can give you hope .
<unk> , the <unk> <unk> of the world create a <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> the planet that <unk> the planet and is important for the <unk> of the planet as the <unk> <unk> .
And you can think about this <unk> <unk> as a <unk> and you can <unk> the total of all the <unk> , dreams , <unk> , <unk> , ideas , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> in being by human imagination .
<unk> is the <unk> <unk> of humanity .
It 's the <unk> of what we are and what we can be as as <unk> species .
And <unk> the <unk> was <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , for example , <unk> that 50 percent of all the species was or the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> just because it 's <unk> , or -- in the <unk> <unk> -- and not not even <unk> <unk> <unk> -- and you don 't even even even <unk> <unk> <unk> -- the <unk> of the diversity of <unk> .
The <unk> of all that is , of course , the <unk> <unk> .
When you 're <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> on this planet .
One language is not only <unk> by a <unk> or a series of <unk> rules .
One language is the <unk> of the human spirit .
It 's the way that the <unk> of every culture comes in the world .
Every language is a forest of the mind , a <unk> , a <unk> of <unk> possibilities .
And of those <unk> <unk> , while we 're sitting here at least , at the <unk> is not <unk> in the <unk> of the children .
They don 't get <unk> to children , who means , unless you do something , who 's already <unk> something that they 're already died .
What 's more <unk> of being <unk> by the <unk> , of being the last last to talk about a language , of not <unk> the way to <unk> the <unk> of <unk> or <unk> the <unk> of <unk> the <unk> or <unk> the <unk> ?
This <unk> <unk> was the state of somebody in the world every two weeks : every two weeks , a <unk> <unk> and door with itself in the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And I know that some of you might be <unk> .
The world would not be a better place if we all the same language ? " <unk> , then we all talk about <unk> . <unk> .
<unk> <unk> .
<unk> of a <unk> thing that means you can 't talk about their language .
Today I 'd like to give you a journey through the <unk> --
a little journey in the <unk> to give you a <unk> of what we 're <unk> .
Most of us , I think , " different ways of <unk> , I mean , I mean , I really different ways of <unk> .
<unk> for example , this <unk> <unk> , the <unk> of <unk> , which <unk> <unk> <unk> from the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
It 's a <unk> that 's not able to <unk> the color of the green because the time <unk> is <unk> in the time of the forest , which we <unk> the <unk> .
They have a <unk> language and a <unk> rule , <unk> , " <unk> <unk> , " <unk> <unk> . " You have to <unk> a different language .
All of this <unk> <unk> , but the <unk> is that in these <unk> families that they talk about six or seven <unk> because of the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
You start to hear and then I started talking about .
<unk> one of the most interesting <unk> that I 've lived , the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , an incredible <unk> that had the first <unk> in <unk> .
In <unk> , I had a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
They made <unk> by the top pictures that <unk> them in the <unk> <unk> , who this <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> , he had never seen anything about <unk> .
They <unk> the pictures of the earth , they <unk> to the research of a form or a <unk> and , not <unk> , they have <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> , and they <unk> the five <unk> with <unk> .
But <unk> not only <unk> .
They <unk> with them .
<unk> percent of the <unk> <unk> was <unk> by themselves .
We 're <unk> at eight <unk> and we found two <unk> <unk> , and when we <unk> to know , they <unk> that one of them was so <unk> that he died , and then they <unk> it . They <unk> it . They <unk> the same . [ <unk> ] ] ] <unk> , <unk> <unk> . <unk> <unk> , the same way , they had an incredible knowledge of the forest .
The <unk> were able to recognize the animal from 40 <unk> and <unk> the species .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
For a sense of <unk> , I would have to understand the <unk> culture and that <unk> is not <unk> <unk> .
It 's quite a <unk> <unk> <unk> of the world .
Very interesting .
If you try to <unk> the great <unk> of the world , what would you do ?
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , etc . . .
A continent always <unk> out , thinking that Africa <unk> doesn 't <unk> <unk> . And instead and <unk> is not the other than the <unk> of these <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
What makes the <unk> <unk> is the <unk> between life and death .
So <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> can be <unk> by the <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> in the way that for a short moment , the <unk> becomes the <unk> .
For this <unk> <unk> , " <unk> <unk> <unk> go to talk about God .
We <unk> in <unk> and <unk> God . "
And from the moment that you 're <unk> , is the spirit that <unk> you can 't you feel like <unk> ?
So , it 's <unk> to these incredible events : <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a very strong <unk> of the power of the body when it was <unk> in a state of <unk> <unk> .
I <unk> all the <unk> that I 've lived with the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , in <unk> .
<unk> of the <unk> civilization <unk> that once once <unk> on the <unk> <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
In a <unk> continent , this <unk> never <unk> by <unk> .
<unk> today , I 'm <unk> by a <unk> , but their education is extraordinary .
The young <unk> are <unk> by the families to three or four years , and they 're <unk> in a world <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> to the base <unk> for 18 years .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
For all of this time , they 're <unk> to values their society , values that they <unk> their <unk> and only their <unk> <unk> <unk> -- or to say the <unk> <unk> .
At the <unk> of this incredible <unk> , they 're <unk> out and for the first time in their life , at the age of 18 , see an <unk> . And in that moment of the first <unk> , when the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , everything they have learned in theory in the <unk> . The <unk> <unk> of <unk> , everything they have learned in the <unk> . <unk> <unk> . <unk> <unk> <unk> . <unk> <unk> <unk> : <unk> <unk> .
" <unk> ? I said , how I said .
It 's <unk> . Now it 's <unk> . "
They call <unk> and more they say that we , <unk> <unk> , we are the <unk> of the world .
This level of <unk> is extremely important .
When we think about <unk> <unk> and the <unk> environment , and the old history of the <unk> <unk> , which is a concept in his <unk> or maybe <unk> <unk> <unk> and say that these are <unk> <unk> to Earth .
<unk> <unk> are not <unk> <unk> <unk> .
There 's no space for these things in the <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> , but because of time and <unk> , and <unk> , they created a <unk> of the Earth 's <unk> not about the concept of <unk> <unk> , but on a <unk> <unk> . But on a <unk> <unk> , the concept that the Earth can live only because it 's <unk> by human <unk> .
What does it mean ?
It means that a <unk> of the <unk> that <unk> the mountain is a <unk> spirit that <unk> its <unk> is going to be a human human being <unk> , and it 's going to be a very different relationship with the mountain or that <unk> that <unk> a mountain <unk> <unk> that <unk> a mountain <unk> to be <unk> .
which is the <unk> of one spirit or a <unk> is <unk> .
What 's interesting is the <unk> that <unk> the relationship between the <unk> and the natural world .
I grew up in the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> to be <unk> .
That has me a human being different from my friends who believe that <unk> are the <unk> of <unk> and the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> and the <unk> <unk> that are <unk> <unk> , and they 're <unk> in the <unk> <unk> .
If we started to <unk> that these <unk> can create reality , we could start understanding some of them <unk> . We could start to understand some of them . They would like this <unk> .
I <unk> this picture at <unk> in the <unk> <unk> .
Maybe some of you have heard about the <unk> , the most powerful <unk> of the <unk> <unk> .
What makes the <unk> is not the potential <unk> of the <unk> , but his <unk> . It 's <unk> by two things .
On one hand , this <unk> <unk> <unk> that has a series of <unk> , <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
<unk> the only <unk> <unk> <unk> a little bit that <unk> , but it 's <unk> with the <unk> of a <unk> 's family of the <unk> <unk> said .
This <unk> <unk> <unk> , very similar to the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
If you ever see the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> that they 're doing a different <unk> of species , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> that <unk> on the <unk> is a little bit like being <unk> by a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> on a sea of electricity . <unk> 't creates a <unk> of electricity . It doesn 't create a <unk> of the reality ; it makes the <unk> of the reality .
<unk> <unk> with my <unk> , Richard <unk> <unk> , the man who <unk> was <unk> , with his discovery of <unk> <unk> in the <unk> .
My <unk> is not going to <unk> these <unk> as a <unk> because if you you don 't have to tell anybody to be <unk> . [ <unk> ] [ <unk> ] they can 't be <unk> because they 're <unk> by a <unk> that <unk> in the <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
It 's possible to <unk> <unk> only if you could <unk> with other <unk> <unk> that <unk> .
Now , it 's the <unk> that are <unk> <unk> , the same kind of <unk> , the same kind of necessary to <unk> the <unk> . The question <unk> <unk> : in a <unk> of <unk> species , like these <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , not similar <unk> , but that if you <unk> in this way , they create a <unk> version of the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
We use the great <unk> of the <unk> and the <unk> , which can <unk> <unk> .
But if we <unk> to the <unk> , we 'll tell us , " The plants talk . "
What does it mean ?
This <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in the forest , who <unk> <unk> in the forest , and our eyes <unk> in the same species .
If they <unk> their <unk> <unk> us , " <unk> <unk> <unk> , " <unk> <unk> of plants , the rest of the rest of you know everything ? " I said , " No . "
The solution is : you take the <unk> <unk> in a night , <unk> <unk> <unk> with a different <unk> .
And with this is not <unk> <unk> , but it 's much more interesting than <unk> <unk> .
Now , [ <unk> ] the problem is that even the ones that have <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> are <unk> , but in some way to <unk> the <unk> of history , and <unk> <unk> .
In fact , the <unk> century , in 300 years , not <unk> for its <unk> or its <unk> <unk> , but rather like , how we were in and <unk> <unk> <unk> , or <unk> <unk> the mass of diversity and <unk> <unk> <unk> of the planet . Now , the problem is not the change .
All the <unk> through the <unk> were <unk> in a <unk> for new possibilities .
And the problem is not the technology .
<unk> <unk> have not <unk> to be <unk> when they put <unk> and <unk> and <unk> like the <unk> have not <unk> to be <unk> when they <unk> have <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
It 's not the change or the technology that <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> . It 's the power .
The <unk> <unk> of <unk> .
And if you look at the world , you 'll see that these are not <unk> <unk> to <unk> .
They 're <unk> creatures , <unk> <unk> <unk> out of the <unk> force that go beyond their <unk> <unk> .
<unk> who <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> --
a <unk> <unk> <unk> , where you can see the <unk> <unk> , a <unk> that lived in the forest until a generation ago , and now <unk> to the <unk> and the <unk> <unk> <unk> , where you can see the <unk> <unk> <unk> from the <unk> that seems to the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , where the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , where the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , where the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> ,
<unk> <unk> <unk> to the <unk> with the <unk> <unk> to the forest .
Or in the case of <unk> , are the diseases that are <unk> with the discovery of <unk> .
If we <unk> on the <unk> of the <unk> , where I 'm doing a lot of research , you 'll see the <unk> of politics .
As <unk> <unk> , the physics of a <unk> , is <unk> at the <unk> level , but <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> , not only is , but <unk> <unk> in certain <unk> , because it 's <unk> <unk> <unk> in certain <unk> , because it 's part of the development .
And you can 't understand the <unk> of the <unk> until you go from the beginning .
I 've got the <unk> miles from <unk> in the Western <unk> , <unk> <unk> with a young <unk> , but they just come to <unk> with a young <unk> , but they just come to talk about .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> million people <unk> from the <unk> during the <unk> <unk> .
The father of this guy was <unk> at <unk> <unk> .
which means that it was <unk> to the <unk> of Chinese <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
My mother was <unk> and his <unk> was to be <unk> .
It was brought to <unk> in <unk> at age of two years <unk> under his <unk> because he couldn 't have a living without him .
The <unk> , who did the same , was <unk> in the <unk> .
One day , he <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> and , for this <unk> , was <unk> to the <unk> work for seven years .
The pain of <unk> can be <unk> , but the spirit of the <unk> is from <unk> present .
And then , it <unk> to a choice .
<unk> to live in the <unk> world , or we want to <unk> the world of diversity ?
The great <unk> <unk> <unk> , before he died said that his greatest fear was that , in our <unk> to go to this <unk> vision of the world , not only <unk> the whole <unk> of human imagination to a <unk> <unk> of human imagination , but a day we <unk> us from a <unk> <unk> <unk> that there were other possibilities .
And it 's <unk> to remember that our species is <unk> for <unk> years .
The <unk> <unk> , who has <unk> us to <unk> , which has <unk> us to the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , creating the <unk> of the <unk> , creating the <unk> <unk> , and we talk about <unk> years ago .
The <unk> world has <unk> 300 years .
That <unk> story , I didn 't know that we have the answers to all the challenges that we could <unk> in <unk> .
When we started these <unk> <unk> of the world is asked what it means to be human , <unk> with <unk> <unk> .
And it 's in these answers that we all <unk> the possibility of being what we are : a species , which has to make sure that all the <unk> and all the <unk> can <unk> . And there 's great moments of <unk> .
I <unk> this picture on the north of <unk> , when I went to <unk> <unk> with <unk> , and this man , <unk> , and this man , <unk> me , and he <unk> the wonderful story of his <unk> .
The <unk> government was not always <unk> with the <unk> <unk> and in the <unk> for <unk> our <unk> , we <unk> it in <unk> .
The <unk> of this man <unk> <unk> .
The family , <unk> for his life , <unk> <unk> away all the <unk> , and all his <unk> .
You want to know that <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> .
The <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> of this man didn 't <unk> by night or <unk> <unk> .
It 's <unk> away , it 's <unk> the <unk> <unk> and <unk> in their hand . When I did it <unk> , they <unk> it , he <unk> it <unk> it <unk> .
He <unk> <unk> on the <unk> of this <unk> <unk> , and when <unk> <unk> , he <unk> a dog .
He <unk> the dog and created a <unk> , with the <unk> <unk> created a <unk> , <unk> <unk> a other dog , and it 's <unk> on the <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> and all the world . And this , in different ways , [ <unk> ] is the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> and all the <unk> <unk> of the world .
<unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> government <unk> <unk> to the total <unk> of an area of the biggest <unk> of California and <unk> <unk> .
It 's their new <unk> . It 's called <unk> .
It 's a <unk> <unk> . It 's <unk> all the <unk> resources .
One <unk> of how a <unk> can <unk> with his <unk> .
And , to end , I think it 's pretty <unk> at least at the people of us was in these <unk> <unk> of the planet , that they realize that they 're not at all .
For somebody is home .
<unk> <unk> of human imagination , as <unk> to the <unk> of the times . And for us , dreams of these kids , like dreams of our children , as the dreams of the hope of the <unk> hope .
For end , we <unk> <unk> <unk> we are <unk> that <unk> never <unk> .
I think I <unk> --
[ <unk> ] are not <unk> , but we believe that stories can change the world , and maybe we are the best <unk> to tell the stories of the world . Every month our site <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> our <unk> .
Our <unk> are <unk> by millions of people .
Our work is <unk> in <unk> to bring our audience in places that <unk> <unk> from which <unk> <unk> from which <unk> <unk> <unk> from how the <unk> <unk> <unk> , the <unk> of <unk> : the world 's <unk> of <unk> , the world of <unk> <unk> in diversity , and we have to find a <unk> <unk> in a <unk> world . And we have to find a <unk> <unk> in a <unk> world .
where the <unk> of all <unk> can <unk> to our <unk> <unk> .
Thank you .
I 'm going to talk about some of the things that I 've written in this book that I hope you 've already heard and <unk> some <unk> , in the case you don 't know .
I want to start with what I call the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> of what ?
The <unk> <unk> of all the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . The <unk> <unk> <unk> , " If we want to <unk> the <unk> of our citizens . " The way to do it is <unk> freedom . "
The reason is , on one side , in fact that freedom is in itself a value , it 's <unk> , <unk> , <unk> for human beings .
<unk> another is in fact that if we are <unk> , each of us can act for their <unk> to do everything that we <unk> our <unk> , without any one who <unk> in our own own own .
The way to <unk> the freedom is to <unk> .
The more choices people have , more <unk> , and more is their freedom , and more is their <unk> .
This , <unk> , it 's so <unk> in society that nobody <unk> <unk> in <unk> .
And it 's also <unk> <unk> in our lives .
I 'm going to show you some examples of what progress has made .
This is my <unk> . It 's not particularly big .
I <unk> a simple note on the <unk> for <unk> .
In my <unk> , there are <unk> <unk> , <unk> the 10 <unk> of <unk> <unk> and 12 <unk> <unk> <unk> that you can buy a huge number of <unk> in the <unk> <unk> that no <unk> <unk> <unk> that no one of the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Here 's what the <unk> is .
Then you go to the <unk> store <unk> , <unk> , radio , <unk> , <unk> , radio , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
And in this single <unk> store , there 's a big number of <unk> .
We can do six and a half million different <unk> using the <unk> that there are in one <unk> .
<unk> <unk> that there is <unk> choice .
<unk> <unk> : the world of <unk> .
Once , I was a child , you could get all the services <unk> , <unk> that they were <unk> by <unk> <unk> .
You <unk> the phone , not the phone <unk> .
One of that , one of that , was that the phone never <unk> .
These times they went .
Now we have a <unk> <unk> <unk> , especially between phones .
Here 's the cell phone .
My <unk> is in the middle , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , and <unk> for <unk> <unk> .
If you don 't have it yet in the store under the house , you 're very soon that will be <unk> .
And what 's the end of the end is that people <unk> in <unk> and does this question . And you know , <unk> is the answer ? " No . "
It 's not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn 't face things .
So , in other <unk> of life that are much more important than <unk> , <unk> the same <unk> of choices .
<unk> <unk> : It 's not going on in the United States that you 're <unk> from the <unk> and the <unk> you would like to do .
Instead , <unk> from the <unk> , and the <unk> says , " OK , you can do it . And it 's like , you can do it . " <unk> , you can do it . "
You <unk> him , " <unk> , what do you do ? "
And the <unk> says , " <unk> is , he 's got these <unk> and these <unk> , and <unk> <unk> these <unk> . "
" What do you want to do ? "
And you say , " <unk> if you were me , what would you say ? "
And the <unk> , " But I 'm not her . "
The result we call it <unk> <unk> , which does seem like a beautiful thing .
But actually , it 's not that a <unk> the weight and responsibility to make decisions from somebody who knows something , <unk> the <unk> , <unk> to <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> to something else that doesn 't know -- and it 's <unk> , and so not in the <unk> to get decisions .
There 's a huge <unk> of <unk> products , <unk> to people like me and you , that if you think about it 's not any sense , because you can 't <unk> .
But if we can 't <unk> , why do we <unk> them ?
The answer is they want to be that we call the <unk> for <unk> <unk> .
<unk> of how we <unk> is a question of our <unk> now is a question of choice , how you see in this <unk> , " We don 't want to <unk> kids . They 're not going to be <unk> . We have to <unk> .
And we can <unk> how many times we <unk> .
which means that every <unk> , <unk> , you must decide that kind of person .
<unk> to the family and <unk> , a time , and <unk> <unk> <unk> to almost anyone , was that there was that you could <unk> the <unk> .
The only real choice was with who , not when , and we don 't even know what to do after .
<unk> , it 's really to play .
They were <unk> to very smart , and they <unk> their <unk> 20 percent <unk> of time .
And they 're not <unk> , because they 're not <unk> .
But why are I <unk> , I 'm going to say , " <unk> <unk> or not ? <unk> to do it now ? "
" <unk> <unk> <unk> later ? I have to think about kids or career ? "
They 're <unk> <unk> .
And they try to answer these questions , even if this <unk> is not <unk> the <unk> that <unk> and not get a big <unk> to my <unk> .
And they have to do this . They 're important questions .
Now , the work : we 're <unk> , like <unk> <unk> , because the technology <unk> us to work every minute , every day , from every day , the <unk> of the planet , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , there 's a <unk> , and I 'm not going to say anybody where the <unk> works .
I don 't tell you why I want to use it .
What does , this incredible freedom of choice that we have about work ? It 's that we have to decide , <unk> at all , if we have to work or not .
We can go to see our son to play <unk> , with the phone in a <unk> , the other one , and the <unk> , <unk> on the other , and the <unk> , <unk> .
And even if I 'm all <unk> , every minute that we see our son , we 're also <unk> , " I have to do this call ? "
" I have to this <unk> ? I have to <unk> this letter ? "
And even when the answer is , " no , " that makes the experience of your son very different than what would be in other conditions .
So , from any <unk> , we look , little and big things , and <unk> objects and <unk> of life , life is a question .
Once the world was this : <unk> , there was some possibilities , but not everything was a question of choice .
The world of today I think about this : The <unk> is , " Is it a <unk> , or <unk> ? "
The answer is <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> <unk> we all know , so I 'm going to talk about the <unk> .
<unk> this choice <unk> .
The first , <unk> , is that it <unk> <unk> instead of <unk> .
With a lot of <unk> between which <unk> , it becomes very hard to do it .
I 'll give you an example : a <unk> study on the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
A <unk> of my <unk> <unk> data , <unk> society , with about a million <unk> <unk> , with about a million <unk> in different companies .
What she 's discovered is that for every 10 solutions that are <unk> in more , the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> 2 percent .
With 50 <unk> <unk> , there 's 10 percent in less than when they 're available only five . Why ?
Because with 50 <unk> <unk> between which <unk> , is hard hard , and the choice is <unk> to <unk> .
And <unk> , and again , <unk> , <unk> , and of course , <unk> , and of course , it 's never <unk> .
<unk> that doesn 't mean that only means that these <unk> <unk> food because they don 't have enough money , it 's also to say that the decision is so <unk> that we <unk> the <unk> <unk> of work .
They 're not <unk> , they 're <unk> up to five <unk> <unk> for the year from the <unk> of work , which would be <unk> to <unk> .
So , <unk> is a <unk> of the <unk> choices .
And I think it 's going to be the world like this .
" And to end up , for <unk> : <unk> , <unk> or <unk> ? "
You know , you could actually get the right decision , if it 's the <unk> , isn 't it ?
You don 't want to choose the bottom , and you 'll get the wrong <unk> .
So this is the first effect . The second is that even if we can <unk> <unk> and make a choice , at the end , we 're less <unk> by the end , we 're less <unk> by the <unk> of how to choose .
And that 's for several reasons .
One of these is that with many <unk> between which <unk> , if you <unk> one and it 's not perfect , it 's easy to imagine that they could do a different choice that would be better . And what 's going on on is that the <unk> <unk> us to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> from <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And even when it was a decision .
The more choices there are , it 's easier to <unk> any <unk> that is <unk> of <unk> choice .
<unk> , there 's what <unk> call .
Dan <unk> <unk> <unk> very well as the value that we give things to things from what they <unk> .
<unk> , if there are many possible <unk> , it 's easy to <unk> the <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> of the <unk> that you are choice .
Here 's an example . I 'm <unk> with everyone who 's not in New York .
But that 's what you probably <unk> .
There 's this <unk> to the <unk> .
A <unk> place .
<unk> <unk> . <unk> day . It 's all about them .
I don 't know anything . But what he thinks is , " Well , <unk> , it 's <unk> . "
" All my <unk> <unk> are away . "
" <unk> <unk> <unk> . "
And it <unk> two weeks from the idea that 's going to be -- every day -- the chance of <unk> where it wants to .
The <unk> <unk> <unk> for what we have , even when choice was <unk> .
And the <unk> that we have <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to how to <unk> .
Here 's another example .
This <unk> tells us a lot of things .
It 's about the moment , and maybe in the moment , and perhaps in the time .
But the most important point is that anything you 're going to be , you <unk> to not do other .
The things that don 't <unk> have a lot of <unk> that can make sure what we do .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> <unk> .
I tried it on my skin <unk> a new couple of <unk> .
<unk> <unk> always <unk> .
Once they were <unk> , one guy , <unk> them and <unk> <unk> , were <unk> , only after they were <unk> , only after they had a lot of them , they were <unk> , only after they were <unk> , just <unk> .
So , I started to <unk> a new <unk> when the <unk> were gone , and I said , " I need a couple of <unk> , this is my <unk> . "
The <unk> said , " Do you want to <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> ? "
<unk> wants to <unk> or <unk> ? " <unk> " or " <unk> " ? "
" <unk> wants to <unk> ? "
" <unk> <unk> <unk> or <unk> ? <unk> <unk> <unk> -- " <unk> <unk> . "
I was <unk> , and after a little bit I was able to say , " I want the guy that was the only guy . " I had no idea what it was like , so for a hour , now , I was <unk> <unk> <unk> , and then <unk> by the <unk> , <unk> , with the best of <unk> I ever had .
It was the <unk> . With all that choice , I had <unk> the best .
But it <unk> me .
Why ? I 've written a whole book for <unk> .
The reason I was worse is that with all my <unk> was <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> to be <unk> .
I had <unk> <unk> . I didn 't know anything <unk> when I just <unk> a guy , but when I just <unk> 100 different , <unk> , at least one one had to be perfect .
What I had <unk> was good , but not perfect .
And then I <unk> the <unk> with what I was <unk> in <unk> .
The <unk> of <unk> in the people don 't do that <unk> the <unk> that these have <unk> <unk> to the same <unk> .
And this <unk> <unk> , even when the results are good .
<unk> in the world of <unk> , if they realized .
Because if I <unk> it , I don 't know what I 'm talking about .
The <unk> truth is more to this .
" It was better when he was worse . " The reason he was better when he was worse is that when he was worse is that when he was even worse .
<unk> , in the world that we live in -- <unk> , <unk> <unk> that we can <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> that we can <unk> is that things are at the <unk> .
You never have to <unk> <unk> because your <unk> , my <unk> , <unk> are <unk> .
The <unk> of happiness -- what you 're here -- is , " <unk> <unk> " Yes , " <unk> <unk> " Yes , you want to . "
I mean -- a little <unk> moment -- who 's really <unk> and my wife is really <unk> .
I couldn 't do better , I didn 't have any better .
But <unk> not always is a <unk> .
<unk> , a <unk> of <unk> <unk> when there 's only the kind of <unk> is that when there 's only the kind of <unk> is that when you 're not <unk> , and I said , " Why ? "
" Who is <unk> ? " <unk> . "
The world is <unk> . What can I do you ?
When there 's hundreds of <unk> , and I 'll give you a <unk> , and you 'll give you who is the <unk> , it 's <unk> that the <unk> you are you <unk> .
I could do better .
With hundreds of <unk> available , there are not <unk> for <unk> .
So when people make decisions , even if the result is <unk> , they <unk> <unk> and they <unk> their own <unk> .
In the last <unk> , the <unk> <unk> in the world .
I think a <unk> <unk> -- not the only , but important -- of this <unk> <unk> is that people have experiences because the standard <unk> are too <unk> .
And when they have to <unk> this situation they think they 're <unk> .
So the final result is that we 're better , <unk> , but we will <unk> it worse .
I 'll tell you .
This is the <unk> <unk> , what we all take for good and it 's completely <unk> . It 's not true .
There 's no <unk> that a little bit of choice is better than <unk> at all , but from this doesn 't <unk> that much choice is better than a little bit .
There 's a <unk> , <unk> . I don 't know what it is .
But I 'm sure we 've been <unk> by a piece of the level where the choices <unk> our life .
Now , from the <unk> <unk> . I 've been <unk> by the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> is the <unk> .
What allows all this choice in society is the <unk> material .
There are many places in the world , and you know , <unk> <unk> , where the problem is not that they have <unk> choice .
The problem is they have too <unk> .
So the <unk> I 'm talking about is a <unk> <unk> , <unk> society .
And what <unk> does <unk> and <unk> is this : <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> you yesterday about how those <unk> and <unk> <unk> to <unk> are <unk> . It 's a <unk> of money . It 's a <unk> of money .
I mean that these choices , <unk> and <unk> , it 's not that they 're just <unk> .
They 're <unk> <unk> .
They do it worse .
If a little bit of what we do is that in our society <unk> <unk> in those where people have too few people , it would not only their life to <unk> , but also our own life .
This is what <unk> call a <unk> <unk> .
One <unk> of income does good for everyone -- not only the poor people -- because of this choice in <unk> that we <unk> .
So , I 'll end up , " <unk> , you can become everything you want to be --
<unk> , people of culture , <unk> , " What do you do you do that fish ? "
" It 's <unk> that you can 't do anything in a glass <unk> . "
" A <unk> , a <unk> vision of the world --
and <unk> I <unk> it so , at the beginning .
But then , <unk> , I realized that that fish knows that that fish knows .
Because the reality of <unk> is that if you <unk> the <unk> , so that you can 't be <unk> . You can 't <unk> the freedom . You <unk> the <unk> .
If you <unk> the <unk> <unk> so that you can <unk> the <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , and they <unk> the <unk> .
Everybody needs a <unk> .
This is almost certainly too <unk> , maybe even for the fish , and certainly for us .
But the <unk> of some <unk> <unk> is a <unk> for <unk> and , <unk> , for <unk> .
Thank you very much .
