<unk> year I showed these <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> , which for almost three million years has had the size of the United States <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And this <unk> <unk> the problem because it doesn 't show the <unk> of ice .
<unk> <unk> <unk> is , in a way , <unk> heart of the global climate system .
It 's <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
The next <unk> will be a <unk> <unk> on the <unk> of the last 25 years .
<unk> <unk> <unk> are <unk> in red .
You see , you <unk> up to the blue <unk> .
That 's the ice in <unk> , which <unk> <unk> .
You can see that the <unk> <unk> ice , of five years or more , is like your blood , which here is from the body .
In 25 years it was like this , in 25 years .
This is a problem because the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> , and it 's <unk> , it 's <unk> , it 's <unk> , it 's <unk> <unk> , they 're <unk> in <unk> from <unk> .
<unk> to the <unk> of <unk> <unk> , that <unk> <unk> could <unk> , that <unk> <unk> , <unk> this point of not <unk> .
In some <unk> <unk> <unk> , the <unk> is already <unk> from the water .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> ! <unk> : She 's good . The question is if we 're also <unk> .
A reason is that this <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> from the north .
This is a <unk> river <unk> <unk> .
<unk> had never <unk> <unk> .
This is the <unk> <unk> , in the <unk> of <unk> .
If you want to know how the <unk> level to <unk> <unk> on <unk> , you 're going to <unk> <unk> , here is where the sea .
These <unk> are <unk> <unk> .
On the other hand of the planet : <unk> , the biggest <unk> of ice on the planet .
<unk> <unk> <unk> , is <unk> scientists that the <unk> of ice is in <unk> , and that <unk> <unk> on some <unk> <unk> , is particularly <unk> in the <unk> .
<unk> at six feet of the <unk> level , as <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> of ice , you see new <unk> , that a few years ago were <unk> .
<unk> percent of the world population <unk> from the <unk> water from the <unk> .
<unk> <unk> : This <unk> is the source of the <unk> water of this city .
<unk> is <unk> .
But when you 're <unk> , the same happens to <unk> water .
In California <unk> <unk> <unk> is <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> are in the crisis .
<unk> , as you read , they 're <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> in the world <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> are <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> times more <unk> in the last 30 years of <unk> <unk> .
This is a <unk> of <unk> .
If you look at it in the <unk> context , they can see the <unk> .
In the last five years we 've <unk> 70 million <unk> of CO2 every 24 hours -- 25 million <unk> in the oceans .
Look at <unk> the area of the <unk> <unk> , from <unk> , to <unk> , and on both parts of the <unk> <unk> , where there 's a <unk> <unk> of oxygen in the ocean .
The <unk> <unk> of global warming , together with <unk> , which is 20 percent , is the use of <unk> <unk> .
<unk> is a problem , and <unk> is even worse .
The United States is one of the two countries with <unk> emissions , together .
And it 's <unk> to build a lot of other <unk> .
But we 're starting to a <unk> of the direction .
These are the <unk> projects over the last few years and some <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
<unk> , there is a <unk> policy in our country .
<unk> <unk> and oil <unk> have <unk> million dollars in the last year to <unk> <unk> , which is a <unk> .
I 'm going to <unk> something --
<unk> <unk> , in <unk> , where I live , there was a <unk> <unk> billion <unk> of <unk> .
You may have seen it on the <unk> .
This is the second biggest flow of <unk> in America .
It 's been around <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> of one of <unk> <unk> was this .
<unk> : <unk> ♫ ♫ <unk> the <unk> is a <unk> and happy guy .
It 's <unk> here in America , and it <unk> our economy .
<unk> <unk> is <unk> .
It 's <unk> , <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> .
At <unk> : From here , this is a lot of <unk> <unk> .
The biggest <unk> society on the <unk> is <unk> <unk> . This is <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> <unk> : <unk> <unk> -- <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> -- they don 't know what they 're talking about .
At the <unk> : So the <unk> for the <unk> of <unk> has <unk> two <unk> .
This is one of them , one .
<unk> : <unk> : <unk> <unk> , we see the climate change as a <unk> <unk> .
So we 're in the <unk> <unk> of money in a <unk> <unk> to <unk> public and <unk> the truth in <unk> .
In fact , <unk> is not <unk> .
We think it 's <unk> -- it 's got a good <unk> .
So not <unk> of climate change .
We need to do it .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> -- you 've heard -- you 've heard a lot of it .
So , we <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> as <unk> as <unk> .
<unk> ! <unk> cars are a little bit <unk> , but this is the sound of the technology of <unk> .
<unk> <unk> is between the major <unk> of global <unk> , but <unk> technology <unk> that you see all .
Let 's look : this is the <unk> technology 's <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to the economic issue and national security .
<unk> : <unk> America is in the crisis ; the national security , the national <unk> , the <unk> crisis .
The <unk> that <unk> all : our <unk> from the <unk> <unk> , like <unk> and oil <unk> .
Now , there 's a new <unk> , <unk> solution to <unk> .
<unk> America : 100 percent of <unk> energy , in 10 years .
A plan to <unk> America at work , <unk> more <unk> , and help <unk> global warming .
<unk> , a solution that we 're going to solve our problems .
<unk> America . <unk> more .
<unk> : This is the last one .
<unk> : <unk> : It 's about <unk> energy to America .
One of the most <unk> ways of <unk> <unk> to <unk> from the <unk> that <unk> our planet .
<unk> : The future is here . <unk> , a new <unk> network .
<unk> <unk> 2 : <unk> <unk> for jobs .
<unk> : <unk> America . It 's time to be <unk> .
<unk> : A old <unk> <unk> says , " If you want to go to alone .
If you want to go far , go together . "
We need to go far , quickly .
Thank you very much .
<unk> year at TED I did a <unk> on <unk> .
And I decided to <unk> to <unk> on how the machine works .
So , here we were . And for those who were not there , the <unk> is the biggest scientific experiment that we 've ever <unk> -- <unk> miles of <unk> .
His task is to <unk> the conditions that were <unk> less than a <unk> <unk> in the beginning of the universe -- to <unk> million times a second .
All of this is just <unk> .
This is the machine under <unk> .
We 're going to <unk> these <unk> <unk> in the <unk> .
This is what I work . It 's called <unk> -- it 's <unk> feet , and it has a <unk> <unk> .
This is a picture of <unk> <unk> in construction so you can see the <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> last year we <unk> the machine .
And this picture was <unk> by <unk> .
It was <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> .
It 's a picture of the first <unk> of particles that had done all of the <unk> , <unk> in <unk> , <unk> , with a part of the <unk> , and we <unk> particles in the <unk> .
In other words , when you <unk> the picture of 10 <unk> , I <unk> that the machine , which is a great <unk> .
I don 't know if it was this to <unk> <unk> more or this , when somebody <unk> on Google and <unk> that the <unk> page was this .
That means that we 've had a <unk> impact beyond that .
<unk> a week later , there was a problem with the machine , had to <unk> these <unk> here -- these <unk> <unk> .
These <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> when the machine works at the <unk> of the <unk> .
Now , <unk> <unk> <unk> . " It 's not true . I 'm too <unk> . "
And instead they can do it because when they 're very <unk> to become the <unk> <unk> .
So , at least <unk> degrees , at <unk> degrees , at the <unk> of space between stars , these <unk> can bring that <unk> .
In one of the <unk> between the <unk> <unk> , there was a <unk> <unk> .
So the <unk> <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
This was the result .
Now , this is even more <unk> if you think that these <unk> <unk> <unk> more than 20 <unk> , and that <unk> <unk> of about 30 <unk> .
It 's about 50 <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , what we did .
We <unk> them and <unk> .
Now they 're <unk> all of the <unk> place .
<unk> the end of <unk> the <unk> is going to be again .
We <unk> it , and we <unk> to get data <unk> or <unk> , and so our <unk> to discover what the <unk> are the <unk> that <unk> the universe .
Now , of course , in some way , these <unk> <unk> the <unk> value of science and engineering engineering engineering <unk> . It 's easy to <unk> .
I think the fact that it 's so hard , the fact that it 's the value of things like <unk> .
I want to end with the words of a <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , who , in <unk> of <unk> <unk> experiments of his <unk> , his <unk> was <unk> , he said , " It 's not <unk> for the progress of human mind as <unk> that the ideas of science is <unk> , that we don 't have to <unk> in nature , that our <unk> are <unk> , and that there are not <unk> by <unk> . "
Thank you .
I want to start <unk> to <unk> to <unk> when , from children , <unk> .
<unk> <unk> as <unk> and <unk> , <unk> and <unk> and <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , actually , <unk> , <unk> ,
<unk> <unk> is <unk> <unk> to the way that we <unk> part of the world around us .
So , as <unk> <unk> from <unk> of our <unk> with objects , <unk> with my <unk> <unk> <unk> , and my <unk> <unk> <unk> , I started <unk> , I started <unk> : " And if we use a computer , instead of having the only <unk> of the <unk> as digital <unk> that <unk> on a <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of information with both hands ,
and <unk> to our <unk> ?
The question was so interesting that we tried to explore the answer , building the <unk> .
In a few words , a <unk> is a <unk> computer as a <unk> .
In a few words , a <unk> is a <unk> computer as a <unk> .
You can <unk> it with your hand , they can <unk> them , they can hear their movement and they have a <unk> <unk> .
But <unk> , they 're <unk> objects , like <unk> , you can just <unk> .
<unk> are the example of a new tools of tools to <unk> the digital information .
And as they become more <unk> , <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> , of the other , and as they become more <unk> , <unk> of the <unk> of the other , how we <unk> them , we can explore and <unk> <unk> .
Let 's start with some simple example .
This <unk> is <unk> to show you about the video : if you <unk> it in a direction , the video will be <unk> like this , if we go to the other side .
These <unk> <unk> are <unk> of others .
If you <unk> them , you 're <unk> to what they 're going to .
If they come , they can <unk> it and they can <unk> a little bit .
If they come , they can <unk> it and they can <unk> a little bit .
They also <unk> their movement and <unk> .
We <unk> that one of the interesting <unk> of the <unk> <unk> was the <unk> that they could use common <unk> on the data , for example , <unk> <unk> , which color as if it was a <unk> .
In this case , we have three <unk> <unk> as a <unk> <unk> , and I can <unk> it to <unk> the color in the central where they <unk> .
and I can <unk> to <unk> color in the central where it <unk> .
If we 're too far , we can <unk> a little bit of it .
There are also <unk> possibilities of <unk> , like <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> the math and <unk> the <unk> <unk> .
I 'm --
This is a sequence of <unk> that I do with a <unk> <unk> program .
Here we have a words that 's <unk> <unk> .
<unk> , at every <unk> <unk> <unk> a letter on every <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , every <unk> <unk> letter on every <unk> , and <unk> a letter on every <unk> , and while I was <unk> <unk> words , he <unk> on a <unk> .
Then , after about 30 seconds , you <unk> , and you have a new <unk> of <unk> and new possibilities .
Thank you .
Here are some <unk> children in <unk> <unk> <unk> , I did so that I <unk> them and I <unk> a video .
They 're very <unk> .
And one of the interesting things of these kinds of <unk> is that you don 't have to <unk> people .
I just mean , " I <unk> the words " and they know exactly what to do .
Here are other people who <unk> it .
This is our <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , there on the right .
He wanted to only <unk> .
They were just <unk> , for him .
Now , this is a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
We wanted to build a tool for the <unk> of the <unk> .
It can <unk> new characters in the scene , <unk> <unk> their <unk> .
It can <unk> new characters in the scene , <unk> <unk> their <unk> .
Here 's , it 's going to get the sun .
<unk> : The sun is <unk> .
David <unk> : Now he 's brought a <unk> in the scene .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> .
<unk> work ! Yes !
So <unk> <unk> and <unk> can <unk> the characters <unk> --
<unk> : <unk> !
-- I <unk> your story .
<unk> : <unk> !
<unk> : It 's a story with a <unk> <unk> , and it can decide how it 's going to be .
<unk> : It 's a story with a <unk> <unk> , and it can decide how it 's going to be .
<unk> : <unk> away , <unk> .
<unk> : The last example I have time to show you is a <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> music .
It 's a recent tool that 's a recent tool , <unk> music .
<unk> here are <unk> from <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> of these have four different <unk> , and you can choose which .
You can also <unk> these <unk> in a sequence of your <unk> .
And they just <unk> a " sound " and a sequence . "
These are the effects you can control from alive , like <unk> and <unk> .
I <unk> it up to a particular sound and then <unk> to <unk> .
And then there are the <unk> effects of and <unk> , which <unk> to the whole sequence .
<unk> how it works .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> : <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> in a series , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> ,
Now , you 're going to <unk> a <unk> line .
<unk> : <unk> : <unk> . <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> : And now I 'm going to <unk> the <unk> , so I can control the effect of alive .
<unk> : <unk> : I can <unk> the whole sequence of time on one side or the other .
<unk> : <unk> : And now we 're going to <unk> the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> : I can <unk> the sequence .
So I don 't have to <unk> before , but I can <unk> it , <unk> it 's going to be <unk> .
And now , finally , I can <unk> the whole sequence of <unk> on the left <unk> the <unk> <unk> .
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is to build new <unk> <unk> <unk> and more <unk> to how our brain work and body .
And today , I 've had time to show you one of the results of this <unk> , and some possibilities that we 're trying to bring out of the lab .
The concept that I want to <unk> is that 's going to <unk> this new <unk> of objects to <unk> the <unk> media , that <unk> information in our world in our world in the way we want .
Thank you very much .
I don 't see the time of talking to all of you .
I 'm a <unk> .
<unk> books is my <unk> but it 's more than this , obviously .
It 's also love and love <unk> and <unk> of my life .
And I don 't like to be <unk> .
But , said , something particular has been <unk> in my life and in my life , and in my career , who <unk> me to <unk> the whole relationship with this job .
The particular thing is that I <unk> wrote this book , this <unk> called " <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , which , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
And the result is that everywhere I 'm <unk> , people <unk> me as if I was <unk> .
<unk> -- <unk> , <unk> !
<unk> from me now , <unk> everybody <unk> and said , " <unk> 't you fear of not being able to do better ?
You don 't fear is going to write for all of life that you can <unk> to be able to create a book that can <unk> to someone ? "
<unk> that can <unk> to someone ? "
It 's <unk> , you know .
But it could go worse , <unk> , <unk> that I remember , over 20 years ago , when I started to say people -- I was a <unk> -- I wanted to be a <unk> .
I 'm going to <unk> the same <unk> as <unk> .
And people said , " <unk> 't you know they don 't know that they 're not going to be successful ?
You don 't fear <unk> <unk> you <unk> ?
You don 't fear to do this <unk> for all of life without <unk> that anything is ever out and die on a <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> ? "
So , you know .
The answer -- the short answer to all these questions is , " Yes . "
Yeah , I <unk> of all of these things .
I 've always been afraid .
And I 'm afraid of many other things that people don 't know .
<unk> and other things <unk> .
But , as it 's about the <unk> what I thought and <unk> is why ?
Is it <unk> ?
It 's <unk> that anybody who <unk> <unk> <unk> to be <unk> by a job that you feel like to do .
But what is this is so particular in the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in a way that other <unk> don 't do ?
My father , for example , he was a <unk> <unk> and not <unk> of one time in his <unk> in the <unk> <unk> that he was asked if she was afraid she was <unk> <unk> ?
<unk> 't it -- that <unk> of John <unk> , how does it ?
<unk> 't you so , <unk> ?
<unk> , <unk> engineers as a group of certainly not , in <unk> , <unk> the <unk> of being <unk> <unk> .
We <unk> , we have enough this <unk> , and not just <unk> but <unk> of all kinds of <unk> , we have this <unk> of being <unk> <unk> .
And they 're not going to be able to look at the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> that , only in the <unk> century , <unk> young and often for them .
And the ones that don 't have <unk> to be really <unk> by their <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , before you were <unk> , in the last <unk> said , " Every <unk> my book <unk> me about the work of <unk> .
But we don 't know when we 've been <unk> this stuff because we 've heard this so long that we 've been <unk> and <unk> the <unk> that creativity and <unk> the <unk> of creativity and <unk> are in some way <unk> and that art , eventually , we will always <unk> to <unk> .
And the question I want to <unk> you to all here is : are you agree with this idea ?
It 's good at all -- because it 's <unk> from a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
I think it 's <unk> .
And I think it 's <unk> , and I don 't want to <unk> in the next century .
I think it 's better <unk> our great <unk> <unk> to live .
And I certainly know that , in my case -- it would be very <unk> to start <unk> to the <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in which I 'm in my career .
<unk> -- look at it , I 'm pretty young , I 've been about 40 years .
I have about four <unk> <unk> of work in me .
And it 's very <unk> that any <unk> thing that 's going to happen to be <unk> from the world as the work that <unk> after the <unk> success of my last book .
<unk> <unk> , because we 're all about this -- is <unk> that my biggest success is to my biggest success is in my <unk> .
Oh , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> !
You know , this is the kind of thinking that leads a person to start <unk> <unk> at nine nine of the morning and I don 't want to do it .
We will continue to continue doing this work that I love .
So , the question becomes , how ?
And so I think , after many <unk> , that the way to work to continue to <unk> is to <unk> and <unk> it , OK ?
I have to get a <unk> distance of <unk> between me , which I 'm <unk> , and my <unk> <unk> on what the <unk> <unk> . And , as I was going to <unk> the last year models of how to do we go through the time , trying to find other society to see if you have better ideas and more <unk> .
about how to help people <unk> <unk> <unk> of creativity .
And that research has taken me to <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
<unk> because I went back to <unk> and then <unk> back .
<unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> -- people don 't believe that creativity <unk> from men , OK ?
It <unk> that creativity was this <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> men to <unk> to <unk> men from some <unk> <unk> and <unk> , for reasons and <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> of these <unk> <unk> of creativity .
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> to have a <unk> that <unk> <unk> from far .
<unk> were the same idea , but they <unk> the <unk> species of the spirit without a <unk> .
The <unk> that is <unk> , because <unk> <unk> didn 't really believe that a <unk> was somebody was particularly <unk> .
And I thought that a <unk> was this sort of <unk> <unk> that literally <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> , and <unk> out <unk> <unk> , and <unk> out <unk> <unk> the job of the artist and <unk> the result of that work .
<unk> <unk> , here is the distance of which I 'm talking -- that <unk> <unk> that you <unk> from your <unk> .
And everyone thought it was so that it was so <unk> , right ?
So , the <unk> artists were <unk> by <unk> things , like the too <unk> , right ?
If your job was <unk> not <unk> all the <unk> , everybody <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> by this <unk> <unk> .
If your job <unk> , it wasn 't all your <unk> , right ?
Everybody <unk> that was your <unk> to be a <unk> .
And so people <unk> <unk> creativity <unk> creativity in <unk> for a long time .
And then the <unk> <unk> and everything , and we <unk> this great idea ; we put the human being at the center of the universe and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and
This was the principle of <unk> <unk> and people began to think that creativity <unk> completely from the <unk> .
And for the first time in history , he <unk> to <unk> to this , or that artist as a rather <unk> person to a rather <unk> person with <unk> .
And I have to <unk> , I think it was a big <unk> .
I think you 're going to <unk> to somebody , a simple person to believe that they 're like a source , <unk> and the <unk> of all the <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> and <unk> is a <unk> responsibility .
It 's like <unk> somebody to <unk> the sun .
<unk> and <unk> completely <unk> the <unk> and creates all these <unk> <unk> on the <unk> .
And I think it was this pressure that <unk> to <unk> artists in <unk> 500 years .
And , if that is true , and I think it 's , the question is , and now ?
Can we do that ?
We could go back to a <unk> understanding of the relationship between human and <unk> <unk> .
Or maybe not .
Maybe we can 't <unk> 500 years of thinking in an <unk> talk .
And there 's probably people in the audience who <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> on the <unk> of , <unk> , do you <unk> people <unk> <unk> on their projects .
You 're probably not going to be <unk> about this thing .
But the question I want to <unk> is -- why not ?
Why not <unk> this way ?
Because it has more sense of anything that has ever heard about the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> process .
A process that , as anyone who ever <unk> to do something -- so , basically , everybody -- you know , you don 't <unk> .
And in fact , it can be completely <unk> .
I did this <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , who has now 90 years old , but that was a <unk> for all of life and said that during his <unk> <unk> , <unk> out in the <unk> <unk> , <unk> out in the <unk> <unk> , <unk> out in the <unk> , and we <unk> it , in the <unk> from <unk> .
And he said he was like a <unk> <unk> of air .
And she <unk> <unk> to <unk> from <unk> .
We <unk> it to it , because he did <unk> the land under its feet .
I decided to have one thing to do at that point and was , " <unk> as a <unk> . "
And he <unk> up to the house and he was <unk> by this <unk> , and he couldn 't have to get another one of paper and a <unk> <unk> enough to <unk> , as the <unk> , <unk> and <unk> on the page .
Sometimes he couldn 't get enough enough , so <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> without able to get home and the <unk> and the <unk> and she would <unk> her <unk> and she would <unk> <unk> through the <unk> , and she would <unk> <unk> through the <unk> , and she would be <unk> . "
Then there were the <unk> -- this piece , it never <unk> -- there were some moments when the <unk> was almost <unk> , right ?
So , he was <unk> home and he was looking for the <unk> and the <unk> through , and he was <unk> a <unk> in the while he was <unk> , and he was <unk> , and he was <unk> , he was like <unk> with the other hand hand and <unk> .
We <unk> the <unk> from the tail and the <unk> in his body and the <unk> on the page .
And in these cases , the <unk> would be <unk> on the <unk> page and <unk> but <unk> , from the last word to the first word .
So when you <unk> <unk> -- it 's <unk> , it 's exactly <unk> to my <unk> process .
Not my <unk> process -- I 'm not a <unk> !
I 'm a <unk> , and my way to <unk> is ; I 'm going to <unk> every day and work and work and <unk> and <unk> over .
But even me in my <unk> , I <unk> against that .
And I <unk> that many of you <unk> it .
You know , even if the job and ideas <unk> me from a certain source I couldn 't <unk> .
And what is this thing ?
And how can we <unk> it in a way we don 't lose your head , but rather , that <unk> <unk> <unk> ?
And as I 'm as as far as I <unk> <unk> <unk> that I have been <unk> <unk> years ago for a <unk> .
I was talking about this , and you know , <unk> , for the <unk> of life was the <unk> of the <unk> artist <unk> , trying to control , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> these <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> these <unk> <unk> <unk> .
But then he <unk> , he was <unk> on a <unk> <unk> <unk> , he was <unk> on a <unk> <unk> , <unk> it all for him .
<unk> <unk> , and everything of a <unk> <unk> , this little <unk> of <unk> , who comes in his head as the <unk> <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> , and the <unk> , but it doesn 't know how to <unk> .
It doesn 't have a piece of paper , it doesn 't have a <unk> .
So he starts to hear this sort of old <unk> <unk> grow in him , like , " I 'm going to lose , and I 'm going to <unk> <unk> .
I 'm not <unk> enough , and I can 't <unk> . "
And instead of going to <unk> , they <unk> .
<unk> the whole <unk> process and did something completely new .
I just <unk> the sky and said , " <unk> , you see I 'm <unk> ? "
" It seems to <unk> that can write a song now ?
If you really want to <unk> , you 're going to <unk> , when I can <unk> care about you .
<unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> more <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . "
And his <unk> process after this .
Not work , the job was <unk> as <unk> always .
But the process , and the <unk> <unk> that <unk> was <unk> when <unk> the <unk> , the <unk> that he was <unk> out of him , he <unk> out of it , he was <unk> that he had to be a <unk> thing and <unk> .
But I <unk> this <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> a conversation between <unk> and this thing <unk> and <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> , it wasn 't <unk> .
So , how much <unk> the story to change a little bit even the way I <unk> and already <unk> me at a time .
This idea , I was <unk> when I was <unk> , " <unk> , <unk> , " and I <unk> , " and I <unk> in one of the <unk> <unk> where we 're working on something , and we don 't think it 's going to be a <unk> , that 's going to be a <unk> , that 's going to be the <unk> book .
Not just <unk> , right , the <unk> book .
And I started thinking about <unk> this project .
But then I decided to <unk> that <unk> up and <unk> .
So I <unk> my face on the <unk> and <unk> my <unk> to a <unk> <unk> of a room .
And I said to <unk> , " <unk> , what , both we know that if this book is not going to be <unk> me , right ?
Because as you see I 'm <unk> everything I have , I don 't have more than that .
So if you want it to be better , you have to <unk> and do your own part .
OK . But if you don 't do it , you know what , I don 't .
I started writing the same because it 's my job .
And I want to <unk> that was <unk> that I 've been <unk> to do my part . " Because it 's so , it 's in the <unk> of the North Africa of the <unk> people <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> to the <unk> <unk> , people <unk> to <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> and hours to <unk> .
And they were always <unk> , because the <unk> were <unk> and they were <unk> .
But every <unk> , <unk> , something <unk> , and one of these <unk> artists actually <unk> .
And I know you know what I 'm talking about , because I know you 've seen it all at some point , a <unk> like this .
It was like time , and the <unk> <unk> through a kind of <unk> and <unk> <unk> through a kind of <unk> and he wasn 't doing anything different from usually , as the <unk> <unk> before , but it <unk> .
And all of a sudden , not just like a human .
But it <unk> from the <unk> and <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk> .
And when this <unk> , at the time , people <unk> what was , he <unk> her name .
<unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> , " <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , God , " God . "
That 's God , you know .
<unk> <unk> -- when <unk> <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> , <unk> this <unk> with them and <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , " <unk> , " <unk> , " <unk> , " that you can still feel in the <unk> or in the <unk> .
In <unk> , when an artist did something impossible and <unk> , " <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> -- a <unk> <unk> of God .
And it 's <unk> because we need it .
But , the problem comes the next day , for the <unk> itself , when you <unk> and <unk> that are 11 <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> of God is not there .
It 's just a <unk> <unk> <unk> , and maybe you never <unk> to <unk> .
And maybe nobody <unk> the name of God still <unk> , and what does it must do with the rest of his life ?
It 's hard .
This is one of the most <unk> <unk> to do in a <unk> life .
But maybe it doesn 't have to be so <unk> if you don 't believe , <unk> , that the most <unk> of your being come from you .
But let me just <unk> you data in <unk> from a <unk> source of this <unk> part of your life that you have to go to <unk> when you 're finished .
And , you know , if we think it 's all the way .
And so I started <unk> , and it 's <unk> as I <unk> it for several months in the <unk> of the <unk> of the book that I was <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk>
And what I have to go on <unk> when I feel <unk> from this is , not <unk> .
You don 't know . You 're just going to be your job .
<unk> to <unk> for your hand , any one can be .
If your job is <unk> , <unk> .
If the <unk> , you 're going to <unk> you to <unk> <unk> some kind of <unk> , for one moment through your <unk> , then you 're <unk> !
<unk> , do the same your <unk> .
And " <unk> ! " You 're going to be .
I think that and I think it 's <unk> .
" <unk> ! " <unk> <unk> to you the same , even for <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Thank you .
Thank you .
<unk> <unk> : <unk> !
You know , as I 've talked about some of these projects on the human genome , what it can <unk> and the discovery of new genes .
Now we 're <unk> a new way . We started <unk> the biology and now starting from that digital code , we 're <unk> in a new <unk> of biology , <unk> and <unk> life .
We always tried to <unk> big questions .
" What is life ? " It 's something that many <unk> , I think they 've <unk> to understand at <unk> levels .
We tried several <unk> , <unk> to <unk> terms .
We 're <unk> for about 20 years now .
When we <unk> the human genome <unk> to <unk> from the world of biology in the computer world .
Now we <unk> : can we <unk> life , or create new life from this digital universe ?
This is a map of a little <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , which is the species from the <unk> genome between what can <unk> in the lab can <unk> .
And we tried to reduce the genome to <unk> a little bit more <unk> .
We can <unk> a <unk> of genes about 500 that are here .
But when we take a <unk> map , it 's <unk> simple as our .
<unk> , this is simple .
But when we look at all the genes that we can <unk> , one at the time , is very <unk> that this can bring a <unk> cell .
So I thought the only way to <unk> was <unk> this <unk> so that it was <unk> so that it would be <unk> by <unk> of these <unk> questions .
And so we started the <unk> of " Can we <unk> a <unk> ? "
Can the chemistry <unk> that we 've never been able to create these big molecules that we 've never been able to create before ?
And , in case , can we make a <unk> ?
A <unk> is just a piece of <unk> <unk> material .
The speed that we 're able to <unk> life is <unk> <unk> .
Our ability to write the code , instead of <unk> <unk> , but it 's <unk> .
And our <unk> results <unk> <unk> <unk> .
We 've <unk> over 15 years ago .
The process has <unk> a lot of <unk> , <unk> <unk> before we <unk> the early experiments .
But we found that DNA <unk> is very difficult .
There are <unk> of thousands of cars in the world that <unk> small <unk> of DNA , of <unk> <unk> , and it 's a <unk> process : the <unk> is <unk> , the <unk> is <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> are <unk> .
So we had to develop a new <unk> to <unk> these <unk> and <unk> the <unk> .
And this was our first <unk> , from <unk> information of <unk> <unk> genome .
It 's a small virus that bacteria <unk> bacteria .
We designed <unk> , <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> a DNA <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
The interesting part is when we took this piece of <unk> material <unk> and <unk> it in bacteria , the bacteria have <unk> to read this code and <unk> the <unk> particles .
<unk> particles have been <unk> by cells , they 're <unk> back and they 're <unk> <unk> .
I talked about recently with members of the <unk> <unk> industry that they 've certainly <unk> this model .
They <unk> more than you .
I think that 's a situation where software can actually build its <unk> itself in a <unk> system .
But we should do the biggest things .
We wanted to build the whole <unk> of <unk> .
They 're more than <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> code .
So we thought we 're going to <unk> in the size of the virus , so that we can change the <unk> to understand what the <unk> are .
<unk> is <unk> , and if you <unk> information <unk> in a computer , these must be very <unk> .
When we <unk> this genome for the first time in <unk> the standard <unk> was of a <unk> for every 10 <unk> <unk> .
We found , <unk> , 30 <unk> . If we 're going to use that original sequence .
One of the process of the process is to design <unk> 50 <unk> that <unk> with all the other <unk> 50 <unk> to build <unk> smaller <unk> that <unk> together .
We 're going to be <unk> here .
You 've probably read that we 've been <unk> <unk> .
So , we have a <unk> code on four <unk> : A , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> of those <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and there 's a <unk> order of <unk> for every <unk> .
So we can use the code for <unk> words , <unk> , <unk> .
And what we did at the beginning was <unk> .
Some of them were <unk> by the fact that it wasn 't <unk> .
We designed these <unk> to just <unk> <unk> .
There are <unk> <unk> that <unk> them and <unk> <unk> .
And we started <unk> <unk> <unk> .
We 've made these <unk> in <unk> so that we 've been <unk> , and we 're trying to create a very <unk> <unk> <unk> as you see in a minute .
We 're trying to <unk> the process .
So , this seems the <unk> of a <unk> <unk> .
When you get to these <unk> <unk> , more than 100 <unk> <unk> , they 're not going to be <unk> to <unk> .
You get to the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> biology .
So we 've <unk> other <unk> .
We 're going to <unk> another <unk> called <unk> , which in biology <unk> to <unk> DNA <unk> that can <unk> the <unk> .
Here 's an example .
This <unk> , called <unk> <unk> , can <unk> three million <unk> of <unk> .
You can see in the <unk> <unk> as its <unk> is <unk> .
In 12 -- it 's been <unk> exactly like it was before .
We 're going to be able to do that .
These organisms can <unk> completely .
We 're going to live under <unk> .
I 'm absolutely sure that life <unk> in space , and they <unk> to find new <unk> of water .
Actually , NASA <unk> showed that this happens .
This is a picture of the <unk> that we built these <unk> , just using these <unk> , just using the <unk> <unk> design <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
This picture was not <unk> with a <unk> <unk> , but with a <unk> <unk> .
It 's a <unk> so big that we can <unk> with a <unk> <unk> .
These are pictures that <unk> a period of about six seconds .
This is the <unk> that we 've done a little time ago .
They 're more than <unk> <unk> code .
It 's the biggest <unk> of a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
It has a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
If you 're going to <unk> it with a 10 <unk> , we 're going to <unk> this code .
Now , how do we make it work ? How can we <unk> ?
Of course , through a virus is a <unk> <unk> .
It 's a little bit more <unk> when you 're using bacteria .
It 's <unk> even when it comes from <unk> cells like our : you just <unk> the <unk> and <unk> another , which is basically the <unk> process .
In <unk> <unk> the <unk> is <unk> into the cell , but we <unk> <unk> <unk> that we are able to do a <unk> <unk> of a <unk> cell to another cell <unk> .
We <unk> a <unk> <unk> from a species .
<unk> are different than men from <unk> .
We 've <unk> some <unk> in a way that we could decide which to <unk> .
And then he <unk> it with the <unk> so that they <unk> all the <unk> .
And when we put it in the cell <unk> , and <unk> our <unk> <unk> the new <unk> <unk> <unk> the new <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> into the cell .
And <unk> <unk> that we didn 't go beyond , but we tried to <unk> more in there .
This is one of the biggest <unk> of evolution .
We found that <unk> species <unk> a second or a third <unk> somewhere , <unk> in a second thousands of new <unk> to the species .
So who think about evolution as one <unk> at a time you <unk> doesn 't understand a lot of biology .
We 're going to be <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> that DNA .
The <unk> that was in the cell doesn 't <unk> one .
The <unk> <unk> that we <unk> <unk> .
It 's <unk> , and it <unk> the other <unk> as <unk> material , <unk> it , and we <unk> with only cell and the new <unk> .
it 's become blue because of the genes that we 've <unk> .
And in a short <unk> of time , all of the <unk> of a species are <unk> , and it <unk> of all in a new species , <unk> on the new software that we <unk> <unk> in the cell .
All <unk> are <unk> , and <unk> are <unk> , and when you <unk> the code <unk> <unk> exactly to what we 've <unk> .
Now , this may seem <unk> <unk> , but <unk> the software DNA we can change things so <unk> .
Now , I 've already <unk> that 's not about <unk> -- but of progress from three million years and a half million years of evolution and a half million years of <unk> , and I already said that maybe we 're going to create a new <unk> of <unk> on this digital <unk> .
Why do we do that ?
I think it 's pretty <unk> when we think of our <unk> .
We 're going to go from six and a half billion people in <unk> billion in the next 40 years .
Right to give you an example : I was born in <unk> .
Now there are three people on the planet to <unk> in <unk> ; in the <unk> are going to be four .
We 're <unk> now to find food , <unk> water and <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , and <unk> for six and a half billion people .
We 're even <unk> to do it for nine billion .
We 're more than five billion <unk> , more than 30 billion <unk> .
That means 100 million <unk> a day .
When we try to find <unk> <unk> , or any kind of process to <unk> , it will be a huge challenge .
We have to realize all of CO2 <unk> from these materials that <unk> in the atmosphere .
At day , through <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> all over the world , we have a <unk> with about 20 million genes , and I like to think that are the <unk> <unk> for the future .
The <unk> industry is just about a <unk> of <unk> , and think about how many different things are out .
Our <unk> here are <unk> data from the <unk> reality and from our imagination .
Now we have <unk> , <unk> with these <unk> <unk> <unk> , able to create what we call <unk> <unk> .
We can make a big robot that can produce a million <unk> a <unk> a day .
Think about <unk> these 20 million genes or <unk> to <unk> the <unk> to produce <unk> or <unk> , new <unk> , we can change , with a small team , and to create more <unk> biology now that in the last 20 years of science .
And it 's just a standard <unk> .
We can choose to <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
This is a <unk> of some software <unk> that we 're working on to be able to <unk> and design species on the computer .
Well , we don 't know how they 're going to be .
We know exactly how their <unk> code .
Now we 're <unk> on the <unk> generation of <unk> .
You 've seen <unk> <unk> from the <unk> was an experiment .
We 've <unk> on the third generation that we 're going to be <unk> from <unk> to <unk> <unk> as the <unk> <unk> or different kinds of <unk> .
But the only way that biology can have a huge impact without <unk> <unk> the cost of food and <unk> the <unk> <unk> would be <unk> the CO2 in the <unk> , we 're working on to design cells that we 're working on to design that can reach this purpose , and we think that we can have the first <unk> <unk> <unk> in about 18 months .
<unk> <unk> <unk> with CO2 is a <unk> , but in our <unk> <unk> , in our <unk> around the world , we found different <unk> .
This is a <unk> that we <unk> in <unk> .
We 're going to <unk> at <unk> feet of the temperature of <unk> of water .
We 're <unk> from CO2 using hydrogen <unk> as hydrogen <unk> .
We 're trying to understand whether we can <unk> the CO2 , that can easily be <unk> through <unk> , <unk> that CO2 in <unk> , to drive this process .
So , we think we can be able to <unk> what the basic question of the basic question that is what life is we , we <unk> the <unk> goal of <unk> the whole industry .
<unk> . If you can 't do it from TED , where can you ?
We 're going to be a <unk> source of energy .
<unk> , we 're working on using the same <unk> to create <unk> .
You 've seen this year with the flu , we always come back a year and with a dollar in less when it 's about finding the right <unk> .
I think what you can change is <unk> <unk> in <unk> .
Here 's how the future could start looking like , now , the tree of evolution , <unk> evolution with bacteria , <unk> , <unk> , and finally cells .
We 're in so far from <unk> people .
Our purpose is to make a long enough to try to <unk> . Thank you very long enough .
<unk> I 'm going to show you , the <unk> possible possible , some fundamental job , a new technology that we 've taken at <unk> <unk> , almost a year ago . This is <unk> .
It 's a environment that you can <unk> is at local level that <unk> with a huge amount of data .
Here we 're seeing <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> with a kind of <unk> <unk> and <unk> , for a fast <unk> , <unk> images , and <unk> , for a fast <unk> , <unk> images as we want .
And it doesn 't matter how big the amount of information that we see , how big it is these <unk> of data or images .
Most of them are <unk> pictures , but this is a <unk> <unk> from the <unk> of <unk> , and <unk> in the <unk> <unk> .
It doesn 't make any difference because the only thing that <unk> the <unk> of a system like this is the number of <unk> on your screen at any moment . It 's also a very <unk> architecture .
This is a whole book , example of data not images .
This is <unk> <unk> <unk> . Every <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And to <unk> that it 's just about <unk> and not of images , we can do something like that , to actually see that it 's a real <unk> of the text , not of a picture .
It may be a way to read a <unk> book .
I don 't <unk> it .
This is a <unk> example . This is a <unk> number of The <unk> .
Every image is the beginning of a <unk> .
And it really gives you the pleasure and the experience of reading the real <unk> version of a <unk> or a <unk> , which is for nature a <unk> .
We also did something with the corner of this particular number of <unk> .
We 've created <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of what you use in a normal <unk> , and we 've <unk> <unk> of the <unk> content .
If you want to see the <unk> of this <unk> , you can see here .
Or even other models , or even <unk> <unk> .
And this really <unk> some of these ideas to <unk> the <unk> of space on the screen .
We 're going to <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and other <unk> like that , you can 't be <unk> .
Of course , <unk> is one of the most <unk> <unk> for this kind of technology .
And on this is not , I want to lose time , if we don 't say that we have <unk> to be in this field .
These are all the streets in the <unk> <unk> above a NASA <unk> .
So , I 'm going to start with something else .
This is now actually live in the web of the web ; you can see it .
This is a project called <unk> , which <unk> two different technologies .
One is <unk> and the other is a <unk> research that 's very interesting that made by <unk> <unk> , a <unk> student of Washington , with the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . <unk> .
And it 's alive on the web , <unk> by <unk> .
You can <unk> when we do this kind of <unk> , where we can <unk> from a picture to the other and have this kind of experience <unk> .
But the <unk> <unk> of images here actually actually has a meaning .
<unk> <unk> <unk> , and these things are all <unk> together , so that they 're <unk> to <unk> places that are <unk> <unk> all <unk> <unk> <unk> have been <unk> . And here you see some <unk> of a <unk> <unk> , and these things are all <unk> at <unk> level .
I don 't know if I have time to show you some other environment .
There are a lot more <unk> .
I want to go directly to one of the <unk> of <unk> data , and this <unk> from a <unk> <unk> <unk> that we 've done for the first time in <unk> to show you what we 've done is really the key behind this technology , <unk> technology . And it 's not <unk> as <unk> as <unk> as we 've <unk> by the <unk> that we 've done in the website .
We had to <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
This is a <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> images of types of <unk> in <unk> , other <unk> and <unk> and <unk> . We 're going to <unk> <unk> , and so on . I 'm going to <unk> <unk> <unk> .
So they 're all <unk> images from <unk> and they 're all <unk> on the <unk> level like this .
And it 's possible to <unk> this <unk> way .
You know , I would never have thought of <unk> .
It 's very <unk> <unk> <unk> this kind of <unk> here .
I think you 're going to see that this is a lot of different types of <unk> : from the <unk> <unk> <unk> , a <unk> number , <unk> number , <unk> number , and this <unk> <unk> together in this environment .
And if I can , I <unk> to look at the <unk> .
Many are <unk> by <unk> , etc .
There 's a <unk> of photographs -- <unk> .
This is a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
We can go from <unk> to <unk> physics of this environment .
The <unk> point is that we can do things with social environment . This is now <unk> from the whole memory of how we <unk> the whole <unk> of <unk> <unk> , and <unk> all that data together .
All of those pictures become <unk> together , more than the <unk> .
You have a <unk> model of the whole <unk> .
Think about this as the <unk> of the work of <unk> <unk> on Earth .
It 's something that <unk> in <unk> complexity as people <unk> , and the <unk> that they 're going to <unk> it with the use .
Their pictures are <unk> <unk> with <unk> from other people .
If somebody comes the idea of <unk> , these <unk> <unk> the name , my picture of <unk> <unk> <unk> , you 're <unk> <unk> , you 're <unk> <unk> , you can use the pictures of everybody else , and I can use it as a <unk> <unk> , and <unk> .
Of course , a <unk> of all of this is <unk> models of every interesting interesting part of the land , <unk> not just from <unk> <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> , but from <unk> .
Thank you very much .
Chris Anderson : I figured out right ? What your software your software <unk> to do is that at some point , in the next few years , all the pictures that we 're all <unk> from anybody in the world 's world that 's going to be <unk> ?
<unk> : Yeah . What 's doing is it 's basically <unk> .
It 's creating <unk> , if you want , between images .
And it 's <unk> is doing it at the content of images .
And the thing becomes very interesting if you think about the <unk> of <unk> information that many of these <unk> images .
As you do a research <unk> of images on the web , you <unk> a <unk> and the text on the web has a lot of information about images .
Now , what happens if that picture is going to <unk> all your picture ?
So the amount of <unk> <unk> and the amount of <unk> that 's really huge . It 's a <unk> effect .
CA : <unk> , it 's really incredible . <unk> .
<unk> : I <unk> a lot .
One of the major <unk> when you 're <unk> and one of the <unk> research is to be able to live between who don 't <unk> the <unk> <unk> , among the past in the wind , the <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
You might think that <unk> <unk> <unk> still beyond the <unk> <unk> , or that <unk> <unk> are still <unk> <unk> <unk> , or that <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> still the <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> , and that the idea that the world we live in in which , the world in which we don 't have in <unk> sense , but it 's just a model of reality .
the <unk> of a particular <unk> of <unk> choices that our <unk> has done , good or evil , many <unk> .
And , of course , everybody <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Everybody <unk> . <unk> .
We 're <unk> <unk> <unk> .
We have to <unk> the <unk> of death , so we don 't know if we <unk> and <unk> --
We all have a art .
What <unk> is the <unk> of the song , the <unk> of every culture .
It doesn 't matter that <unk> are <unk> , or the <unk> of <unk> , or the <unk> <unk> <unk> , or the <unk> <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , or a <unk> in the <unk> .
He was my <unk> of trip in <unk> a month ago , or a <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> 's <unk> .
All of these <unk> <unk> that there are other ways of <unk> other ways of thinking , other ways of moving around the world .
And , if you 're going to <unk> , it 's a concept that can give you hope .
<unk> , <unk> <unk> of the world create a <unk> of <unk> <unk> and <unk> that <unk> the planet and it 's important for the <unk> of the planet as the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And you can think of this <unk> <unk> as a <unk> and you can <unk> the <unk> <unk> of all <unk> , dreams , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> in being by the human imagination .
<unk> is the <unk> of humanity .
It 's the <unk> of what we 're and what we can be as as <unk> species .
And <unk> <unk> was <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , for example , <unk> that 50 percent of all species has been or is on the <unk> of <unk> <unk> -- in the <unk> of the <unk> -- in the <unk> of the <unk> -- in the <unk> diversity -- and you don 't even <unk> at the <unk> -- that of the diversity .
The <unk> of all of this is , of course , the <unk> <unk> .
When you 're <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> on this planet .
A language is not only <unk> by a <unk> or a <unk> of <unk> rules .
A language is the <unk> of the human spirit .
It 's the medium with the <unk> of every culture comes in in the world .
Every language is a forest of the mind , a <unk> , a thought of a <unk> of <unk> .
And of those <unk> <unk> , as we 're sitting here at least half the <unk> is no longer in the <unk> of children .
It 's no longer <unk> to children , which means less than <unk> , they 're already <unk> .
What is more <unk> than being <unk> by the <unk> , of being the <unk> , of being the <unk> of <unk> , not <unk> the <unk> of <unk> or <unk> the <unk> of <unk> ?
This <unk> <unk> <unk> was the state of somebody in some world every two weeks : every two weeks -- every two weeks -- every two weeks -- every two weeks , a <unk> <unk> .
And I know that somebody of you know , " <unk> 't it ?
The world doesn 't be a better place if we all have the same language ? " <unk> , then we 're all <unk> . <unk> .
<unk> <unk> .
<unk> of a <unk> thing that means you can 't talk about your language .
I 'd like to make you a trip through the <unk> --
a small trip in the <unk> to give you a <unk> of what we 're <unk> .
Many of us <unk> that when I say , " different ways of <unk> . " I really mean different ways of <unk> .
So , for example this <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , the <unk> of <unk> , which <unk> <unk> <unk> from the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
It 's a <unk> that 's not able to <unk> the blue color from green because the <unk> <unk> is <unk> in the forest , that we <unk> the <unk> .
They have a language <unk> and a <unk> rule , " <unk> <unk> " : you have to <unk> a person talking about a different language .
And all of this <unk> in the past <unk> , though the <unk> is that in these <unk> families , and you 're talking six or seven <unk> because of <unk> <unk> <unk> nobody 's <unk> .
You start listening and then <unk> on and <unk> .
<unk> one of the most interesting <unk> that I 've lived , the <unk> of <unk> <unk> , an incredible <unk> that had the first <unk> in <unk> .
In <unk> five <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
They 've done by the top pictures that <unk> them in <unk> that <unk> <unk> , <unk> that this <unk> forest had never seen anything .
They <unk> the picture of land , they <unk> them to <unk> a form or a <unk> , and they don 't <unk> anything , they <unk> <unk> , and they <unk> the five <unk> with <unk> .
But <unk> not only <unk> <unk> .
They <unk> in each other .
<unk> percent of <unk> was <unk> by themselves .
We 've been <unk> eight <unk> and we found two <unk> and <unk> <unk> , and when we <unk> to know , they <unk> that one of them was <unk> so that he died , and then they <unk> it . And they <unk> it . And they had a <unk> of the forest .
<unk> were able to recognize the animal from 40 <unk> and to <unk> species .
<unk> <unk> , I was <unk> a very interesting job when my <unk> <unk> <unk> me if I wanted to go to <unk> <unk> between <unk> society <unk> to the <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
To make sense of <unk> , I should have to understand the <unk> culture , and that <unk> is not <unk> .
It 's pretty much of a <unk> view of the world .
Very interesting .
If you 're going to <unk> the great <unk> of the world , what would you <unk> me ?
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , etc .
A continent comes out , thinking , <unk> Africa doesn 't <unk> <unk> . And instead and yes and <unk> is not something else the <unk> of these <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> during the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
What makes it interesting is the <unk> relationship between life and death .
So <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> can be <unk> by the <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
So , for <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> go to <unk> <unk> .
We <unk> in <unk> and <unk> God . "
And from the moment that you 're <unk> , is the spirit that <unk> you , how do you <unk> ?
So , it 's <unk> to these incredible events : <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a pretty strong <unk> of the power of the body 's mind when it 's <unk> in a state of <unk> <unk> .
We <unk> all the <unk> that I 've lived with the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , in the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> of <unk> civilization <unk> that once <unk> on the <unk> <unk> of <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> on the <unk> <unk> .
In a <unk> continent of blood , this <unk> has never been <unk> by <unk> .
<unk> today are <unk> by a <unk> , but their <unk> is extraordinary .
<unk> <unk> come from families to three or four years , and they 're <unk> in a world <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> for 18 years .
Two <unk> <unk> <unk> .
For all of this time , they 're <unk> to values , who <unk> their <unk> and only their <unk> <unk> <unk> -- or to <unk> <unk> <unk> -- or to say the <unk> <unk> .
At the end of this incredible <unk> , they <unk> out and <unk> , and for the first time in their lives , at the age of 18 , they see a <unk> . And in that moment of <unk> <unk> , when the sun <unk> <unk> <unk> , everything they 've learned in the <unk> <unk> , all of it 's <unk> in its <unk> . <unk> does a <unk> <unk> , and he says ,
" <unk> ? <unk> as I said .
It 's <unk> . Now it 's <unk> . "
It 's called <unk> and they 're saying that we , <unk> <unk> , we 're the <unk> of the world 's <unk> .
This <unk> level is extremely important .
When we think about the <unk> <unk> and the <unk> <unk> <unk> and the old history of <unk> <unk> , which is a <unk> concept in its <unk> or maybe <unk> <unk> and say that these <unk> are <unk> <unk> to the Earth .
<unk> <unk> are not <unk> or <unk> by <unk> .
There 's no space for these things in the <unk> <unk> of <unk> or in the <unk> <unk> of <unk> , but <unk> of time and <unk> , they 've created a <unk> of the Earth 's <unk> .
What does it mean ?
I mean , you know that a <unk> of the <unk> that the mountain is a <unk> spirit that <unk> its <unk> will be a human being <unk> <unk> and different relationship with the mountain , and it will be well <unk> a <unk> of <unk> that <unk> <unk> that a mountain is a <unk> <unk> <unk> to be <unk> .
which is a <unk> of a spirit or a <unk> <unk> is <unk> .
What 's interesting is the <unk> that <unk> the relationship between <unk> and the natural world .
I grew up in the <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> to be <unk> .
And that made me be a human being different from my <unk> friends who believe that <unk> are the <unk> of <unk> and the <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> that live in the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> .
If we 're going to <unk> that these <unk> can actually create different , we could start to understand some of them . We 're going to <unk> this <unk> .
I <unk> this picture in <unk> in <unk> <unk> .
Maybe some of you 've heard some of you have heard about the <unk> , the most powerful <unk> of the <unk> <unk> .
What makes the <unk> is not the potential of the <unk> <unk> , but its <unk> . It 's <unk> by two elements .
On one hand , this <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
<unk> the only <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
This <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , very similar to <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
If you 're going to see the <unk> <unk> on the <unk> , the <unk> that they 're doing from a different <unk> of species , it <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> that <unk> on the <unk> is a little bit of as being <unk> by a <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> on a sea of electricity . <unk> 't create a <unk> of the reality of the <unk> .
I often <unk> with my <unk> , Richard <unk> <unk> , the man who <unk> was <unk> , with his discovery of <unk> <unk> in the ' <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , you can 't <unk> these <unk> as <unk> because if you 're done you can 't tell anybody to be <unk> . <unk> 't be <unk> because they 're <unk> from a <unk> that is , <unk> <unk> .
It 's possible to <unk> <unk> only if you could <unk> with other <unk> <unk> that <unk> .
Now , it 's the <unk> <unk> . The <unk> <unk> are <unk> , the same kind of <unk> that are <unk> , the kind of necessary to <unk> the <unk> . The question <unk> : in a <unk> of <unk> species of plants , as these <unk> <unk> <unk> , but if you 're going to <unk> in this way , they create a <unk> version that 's <unk> at the <unk> of the parts ?
We use the great <unk> of <unk> and <unk> , which can <unk> .
But if you go to the <unk> , we 'll <unk> " <unk> " . "
What does it mean ?
This <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , who <unk> <unk> in the forest , and our eyes <unk> in the forest , and our eyes <unk> in the same species .
If <unk> <unk> their <unk> <unk> us , " <unk> <unk> " <unk> " <unk> " <unk> " -- " I said , " No , " I said , " No . "
The solution is : they take the <unk> <unk> in a night , <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> with a different <unk> .
With this not <unk> <unk> , but it 's much more interesting than <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Now , [ <unk> ] the problem is that even those of us who have <unk> <unk> <unk> them , but in some way to the <unk> of history of our real world , as as well as as as well as as as well as as well as as as well as our real world , and <unk> .
In fact , the <unk> century , in 300 years , not <unk> <unk> for its <unk> , but rather as the <unk> was where we <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> the <unk> of diversity and <unk> and <unk> on the planet . Now the problem isn 't the change .
All <unk> through <unk> have been <unk> in a <unk> for new possibilities of life .
And the problem is not technology .
<unk> <unk> don 't have <unk> to be <unk> when they put <unk> and <unk> as they <unk> <unk> and <unk> as as they don 't <unk> to be <unk> when they put <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
It 's not the change or technology that <unk> the <unk> of <unk> . It 's the power .
The <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And if you look at the world , you know , you 're not <unk> <unk> .
They 're <unk> creatures and <unk> <unk> <unk> out of the <unk> forces that go beyond their <unk> capacity .
<unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
a <unk> <unk> <unk> , in <unk> <unk> , a <unk> that has lived in the forest to a generation <unk> , and now <unk> to the <unk> <unk> and <unk> on the <unk> <unk> , where you can see the <unk> <unk> <unk> from the <unk> <unk> , where you can see the <unk> <unk> <unk> , where the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , where the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> ,
We 're going to <unk> the <unk> with the <unk> <unk> to the forest .
Or , in the case of <unk> , it 's the disease are <unk> with the <unk> discovery of <unk> .
If we 're <unk> on the <unk> of the <unk> , where I 'm doing a lot of research , you 'll see the <unk> of politics .
As <unk> <unk> , <unk> physics of a <unk> , is <unk> at a <unk> level , but the <unk> , the <unk> of <unk> <unk> 's life of a <unk> , not only is <unk> , but <unk> <unk> in certain <unk> , because it 's part of development .
And you can 't understand the <unk> of the <unk> until you start from the beginning .
I <unk> <unk> miles from <unk> in China through the <unk> <unk> , <unk> to <unk> with a young <unk> , but only <unk> <unk> to <unk> , I just <unk> , I got to <unk> it out what the <unk> behind .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> million people <unk> from <unk> during the <unk> <unk> .
The father of this guy was <unk> at <unk> <unk> .
which means that it 's been <unk> at the time of Chinese <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> is <unk> <unk> with <unk> <unk> during the <unk> that led to <unk> .
My mother was <unk> and her <unk> was <unk> .
It was taken to <unk> in <unk> at age age of two <unk> <unk> his <unk> because he couldn 't have been able to live without him .
The <unk> , who did the same , was <unk> in <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and for this <unk> , was <unk> to <unk> <unk> for seven years .
<unk> 's pain can be <unk> , but the <unk> <unk> of <unk> is <unk> present .
At the end , it <unk> to a choice .
<unk> to live in the <unk> world of <unk> or we want to <unk> the world of diversity of diversity ?
The great <unk> <unk> <unk> , before he died said that his biggest fear was that , in our own <unk> <unk> <unk> , not only <unk> the whole <unk> of human imagination , not only <unk> the whole <unk> of <unk> <unk> , but a day we <unk> from a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that there were other possibilities .
And it 's <unk> <unk> that our species is <unk> for <unk> years .
The <unk> <unk> , who gave us <unk> , which <unk> us to <unk> <unk> , <unk> the <unk> of <unk> , <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , <unk> the <unk> of <unk> , and we talk about <unk> years ago .
The <unk> world has <unk> 300 years old .
That <unk> story not to me that we have the answers to all the challenges that we 're going to <unk> in <unk> .
When we have <unk> <unk> of the world is asked what it means to be human , <unk> with <unk> different <unk> .
And it 's in these answers that we all <unk> the possibilities of being what we are , sort of , which has to <unk> the <unk> and all the <unk> can <unk> . And there are great moments of <unk> .
I <unk> this picture on the north of <unk> , when I went to <unk> <unk> with <unk> , and this man , <unk> , <unk> , he <unk> me the wonderful story of her <unk> .
The <unk> government <unk> was not always <unk> with the <unk> <unk> and in the ' <unk> for <unk> , we <unk> it in <unk> .
The <unk> of this man <unk> <unk> .
<unk> family , <unk> for her life , <unk> <unk> all of the <unk> , and all of her <unk> .
You want to know that <unk> don 't <unk> , <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> were made of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> of this man didn 't <unk> from night or <unk> .
It 's <unk> away , it <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> in your hand . When I did it <unk> , I <unk> it <unk> it , he <unk> it <unk> .
It has <unk> <unk> on the <unk> of this <unk> <unk> and when <unk> <unk> , he <unk> a dog .
He <unk> the dog and created a <unk> , with the <unk> <unk> has created a <unk> , has <unk> another dog and <unk> on the <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> to talk about <unk> ? <unk> [ <unk> ] and this , in different ways , [ <unk> ] is the <unk> <unk> <unk> and all the <unk> <unk> <unk> and all the <unk> <unk> of the world .
<unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> government <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
It 's their new <unk> . It 's called <unk> .
It 's a <unk> <unk> . It 's <unk> all the <unk> resources .
One <unk> example of how a <unk> can <unk> with its <unk> .
And , finally , I think it 's pretty <unk> at least at the people of us in these <unk> areas of the planet , <unk> that are not <unk> at all .
For somebody is home .
<unk> <unk> of the human imagination that <unk> to <unk> the <unk> of time . And for all of these children 's dreams , as our children 's dreams of our children , become part of the <unk> hope of the <unk> .
<unk> , we <unk> <unk> <unk> , we 're <unk> that <unk> never <unk> to anything .
I <unk> <unk> --
<unk> <unk> are not <unk> , but we believe that stories can change the world , and perhaps we are the best <unk> to tell the stories of the world . Every month our website <unk> <unk> million <unk> .
<unk> <unk> : <unk> <unk> our <unk> <unk> .
Our <unk> are <unk> from millions of people .
Our work is <unk> in <unk> to <unk> our public in places that are <unk> from <unk> how they 've seen and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , the <unk> world of <unk> <unk> in the diversity , and we need to find a <unk> of life in a <unk> world and <unk> .
where the <unk> of all <unk> can <unk> to our <unk> <unk> .
Thank you .
I 'm going to talk about some things that I 've written in this book that I hope to <unk> other you 've heard and <unk> some <unk> <unk> , in case you don 't <unk> them .
I want to start with what I call " the <unk> <unk> . "
<unk> <unk> ?
The <unk> <unk> of all <unk> society <unk> . The <unk> <unk> <unk> : " If we want to <unk> the <unk> of our citizens . " The way to do that is <unk> the freedom . "
The reason is , on one side , in fact that freedom is in itself , it 's <unk> , it 's <unk> , <unk> for human beings .
On the other one is that if we 're <unk> , each of us can act to <unk> for all that we <unk> our <unk> , without anybody in our <unk> .
The way to <unk> freedom is to <unk> choice .
<unk> more choices people are <unk> , and more they 're <unk> , and more of their freedom , more is their <unk> .
This is , <unk> , it 's so <unk> <unk> in the society that nobody <unk> <unk> in <unk> .
And it 's also <unk> <unk> in our lives .
I 'm going to show you some examples of what progress has made possible .
This is my <unk> . It 's not particularly big .
I <unk> a simple note on the <unk> to <unk> .
In my <unk> , there are <unk> <unk> , without <unk> the 10 <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> and 12 <unk> <unk> <unk> that you can buy for a huge number of <unk> in the <unk> <unk> that nobody of the <unk> <unk> is already <unk> .
Here 's what <unk> is what <unk> is .
Then you go to the <unk> store <unk> : <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
And in this single <unk> <unk> , there 's a big number of <unk> .
We can make six and a half million different <unk> using the <unk> that there are in one <unk> .
<unk> <unk> that there is <unk> choice .
<unk> <unk> : the world of <unk> .
Once , when I was a child , they could get all the <unk> services , in <unk> that they were <unk> by <unk> <unk> .
You <unk> the phone , you don 't <unk> it .
A <unk> of that , between the other , was that the phone never <unk> .
These days are gone .
We now have a <unk> <unk> <unk> , especially between cell phones .
Here 's cell phones .
My <unk> is in the middle , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , and <unk> for <unk> <unk> .
If you don 't see it yet in the <unk> <unk> , you 're very soon that they 're <unk> .
And what happens is that people <unk> in the <unk> and does this question . And you know , what is the answer ? The answer is " No . "
It 's not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn 't make things .
So , in other <unk> of life that are much more important than <unk> , <unk> the same <unk> of choices .
<unk> <unk> : <unk> doesn 't happen in the United States that you 're <unk> from <unk> and the <unk> <unk> you what you have to do .
Instead , <unk> from the <unk> , and the <unk> says , " Well , we could do it . Or , we could do it . <unk> " And they <unk> these <unk> and these <unk> " <unk> <unk> these <unk> and these <unk> . What do you want to do ? "
You <unk> him , " What do you do ? "
And the <unk> says , " <unk> has these <unk> and these <unk> , and <unk> has these <unk> and <unk> . "
" What do you want to do ? "
And you say , " <unk> if you were me , what ? "
And the <unk> : " But I 'm not her . "
We <unk> it up the <unk> of <unk> , <unk> that makes it look like a good thing .
But it 's not that one <unk> the <unk> and the responsibility to make decisions from somebody who knows something , <unk> the <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and almost , of course , is <unk> -- and it 's <unk> , and it 's <unk> about it .
There 's a huge <unk> of <unk> products , <unk> to people like me and you , if you think about it doesn 't make sense , because we can 't <unk> .
But if we can 't <unk> , why can we <unk> them ?
The answer is they want to <unk> to <unk> the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> of so <unk> as it is our <unk> <unk> . It 's a choice , as you see in this <unk> . " We don 't want to <unk> children . We don 't <unk> their sex at the right moment . " We don 't <unk> a <unk> <unk> . We have to <unk> it .
And we can <unk> how many times we <unk> .
which means that any <unk> , <unk> , you have to decide that kind of person .
We 're going to go to the family and <unk> , a common perspective , almost for anybody , was that there was <unk> the <unk> as soon as possible .
The only real choice was with people , not when , and not even what to do next .
<unk> , it 's really about to play .
We 're going to <unk> , and they <unk> the 20 percent of the <unk> of the time .
And not because they 're not <unk> , not because they 're not <unk> .
But why am I <unk> , I 'm <unk> to say , " <unk> <unk> , or not ? "
" <unk> <unk> <unk> ? " I have to think before the children or the career ? "
They 're <unk> <unk> .
And they try to answer these questions , even though this <unk> doesn 't <unk> the <unk> that we 're not going to get the <unk> that we 're not going to get the <unk> to my <unk> .
And they really have to do that . They 're important questions .
Now , the job is : we 're <unk> , as <unk> <unk> , because technology <unk> us to work every day , every day , from every <unk> of the planet , <unk> from <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , there 's a <unk> , and I 'm not going to say , where the <unk> works .
I don 't tell you that , because I want to use it .
What does , is the <unk> of choice that we have about work ? It 's that we need to decide , <unk> at any time , if we have to work or not .
We can go to see our son to play <unk> , with the phone in a <unk> , the <unk> in the other way , and the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
And even if they 're all <unk> , every minute we see our son , we 're also <unk> , we 're <unk> , " I 've got to <unk> to this call ? "
" I have to answer this <unk> ? " I have to <unk> this letter ? "
And even when the answer is , " no , " that makes the experience of your <unk> 's <unk> 's <unk> .
So , from any of you look , and big objects , small and big objects , life is a choices .
Once the world was this : <unk> , there were some possibilities , but not everything was a choice .
The world of today is <unk> to this : The <unk> is , " Is it a <unk> thing , or <unk> ? "
The answer is <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> all of them , so I 'm going to talk about the <unk> .
We 're going to <unk> two effects effects of people .
The first one , <unk> , is that <unk> instead of <unk> .
With a lot of <unk> between which choice , it becomes very hard to do .
I 'm going to give you a <unk> example : a study <unk> <unk> <unk> .
A <unk> of my <unk> had access to <unk> data , <unk> society 's <unk> , with about a million <unk> <unk> in different <unk> .
What she found is that for every 10 <unk> that are <unk> in the <unk> of <unk> 2 percent .
With 50 <unk> <unk> , there 's 10 percent less than when they 're available to only five . Why ?
Because with 50 <unk> between which <unk> , is <unk> difficult to decide , and the choice is <unk> to the <unk> .
And in <unk> , and still <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and of course , <unk> , it 's never <unk> .
<unk> that doesn 't just mean that these <unk> <unk> <unk> food to <unk> because they don 't have enough money , it 's the decision , it 's also <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> 't <unk> , they 're not <unk> , they 're <unk> <unk> <unk> for year from <unk> of work , that would be <unk> to <unk> .
So the <unk> is a <unk> of having <unk> choices .
And I think <unk> the world like this .
" And finally , <unk> : <unk> , <unk> or <unk> ? "
You really need the right decision , if it 's <unk> , right ?
You don 't want to choose the <unk> wrong , and <unk> the <unk> wrong <unk> .
So this is the first effect . The second effect is that even if we can <unk> <unk> and make a choice , at the end , we 're less <unk> from the result of how to <unk> states with less <unk> between which <unk> .
And that 's why .
One of them is that with a lot of <unk> between which <unk> , if you 're <unk> one and it 's not perfect , it 's easy to imagine that they could make a different choice . And what 's going on is that the <unk> <unk> us to <unk> of choice , and the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> by <unk> ,
even when it was a <unk> decision .
<unk> : <unk> , more choices is <unk> than any <unk> that is <unk> of <unk> .
<unk> , there 's what <unk> call .
Dan <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> very well as as the value of things that we <unk> .
<unk> rest , when there are many <unk> possible , it 's easy to <unk> the <unk> of <unk> <unk> and be less <unk> than the <unk> <unk> that has <unk> .
Here 's an example . I 'm <unk> with all the <unk> <unk> .
But that 's probably <unk> .
There 's this <unk> <unk> .
A place of <unk> .
<unk> <unk> . <unk> day . It 's all about them .
It doesn 't <unk> anything . But what he thinks is , " Well , <unk> , it 's <unk> . "
" All my <unk> <unk> are away . "
" <unk> <unk> <unk> right in front of the house . "
And it <unk> two weeks from the idea that 's <unk> -- every day -- the ability to <unk> where it wants .
The <unk> <unk> <unk> for what we have , even when choice was <unk> .
And the more of the <unk> that we 've been <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> .
Here 's another example .
This <unk> tells us a lot of things .
It 's about the moment , and maybe a living in the time .
But the most important point is that anything you 're going to <unk> , you 're not doing other .
<unk> that things don 't <unk> have a lot of <unk> that can make less <unk> what we do .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> <unk> .
I tried it on my skin <unk> a new couple of <unk> .
We 're almost always <unk> .
Once the <unk> were <unk> of one guy , <unk> them and <unk> <unk> , were <unk> , only after <unk> <unk> <unk> a life and <unk> a lot of times , they were <unk> <unk> .
So , I started <unk> a couple of new when the <unk> were gone , and I said , " I need a couple of <unk> , this is my <unk> . "
The <unk> said to me , " Do you want to <unk> , <unk> , <unk> ? "
You want them to <unk> or with <unk> ? " <unk> " or " <unk> " ?
" " <unk> <unk> does it ? "
" <unk> wants to <unk> them or <unk> ? <unk> <unk> <unk> -- " <unk> to <unk> .
I was <unk> , and after a little bit , I was <unk> to say , " I want the guy -- that was the only guy , " <unk> had no idea what it was , so for a <unk> <unk> , and then I was <unk> all <unk> <unk> , and then <unk> from the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , with the <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> ,
It was <unk> . With all that choice I had <unk> the best .
But I <unk> to get worse .
Why ? I 've written a whole book to <unk> .
The reason I was worse is that with all that choice my <unk> were <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
I had <unk> <unk> . I didn 't know anything about <unk> when I <unk> only a guy , but when I <unk> 100 different , I <unk> , at least one kind of has to be perfect .
And what I had <unk> was good , but not perfect .
And after I <unk> that <unk> with what I was <unk> in <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> in people don 't make the <unk> of people don 't make the <unk> of <unk> .
And this <unk> <unk> , even when the results are good .
<unk> in the world of <unk> if they realized .
Because if you <unk> it , I don 't know what I 'm talking about .
The truth is to <unk> more than that .
" It was better when it was worse , " The reason he was better when he was worse , it was <unk> when he was worse , he was <unk> <unk> .
<unk> , in the world that we live in -- <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> -- the <unk> that we can <unk> is that things are <unk> .
You 've never <unk> <unk> because your <unk> , my <unk> , <unk> are <unk> .
The <unk> of happiness -- what you 're here -- is , " <unk> <unk> " Yes , you want to . "
I mean , little <unk> moment -- who I 'm really <unk> and my wife is really <unk> .
I couldn 't do better , I didn 't have <unk> .
But <unk> isn 't always a <unk> thing .
<unk> , a <unk> of <unk> a couple of <unk> <unk> when there is only that kind of <unk> is that when you 're not <unk> , and you say , " Why ? "
" Who is <unk> ? " <unk> is <unk> .
The world is <unk> . What can I do it ?
When you have hundreds of types of <unk> , and you 're going to <unk> a <unk> , and you 're <unk> who is the <unk> , it 's <unk> clear that the <unk> you are .
We could have better .
With hundreds of <unk> available , there are not <unk> for <unk> .
So when people make decisions , even if the result is <unk> , they <unk> <unk> and give them their own .
In the last few years , the <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> world .
I think a <unk> <unk> -- not the only , but important -- of this <unk> of <unk> is that people have <unk> experiences because the standard standard are too <unk> .
And when they have to <unk> this situation think that <unk> is them .
So the final result is that we 're better , <unk> , but we 're going to be worse .
Let me <unk> you .
This is the <unk> <unk> , what we all <unk> and is completely <unk> . It 's not true .
There is no <unk> that a little bit of choice is better than <unk> , and not <unk> at all , but this doesn 't <unk> that much choice is better than a little bit .
There 's a <unk> value , <unk> . I don 't know what it is .
But I 'm sure we 've <unk> from a piece of <unk> the level that we <unk> our lives .
Now , from a <unk> point of view -- from a <unk> point of view , <unk> is the <unk> .
And what allows all this choice in <unk> society is the <unk> material .
There are many places in the world , and you know , <unk> <unk> , where the problem is not that they have <unk> choice .
The problem is they have too <unk> .
So the <unk> <unk> that I 'm talking about is a <unk> <unk> of <unk> , <unk> society .
And what <unk> does <unk> and <unk> is this : <unk> <unk> <unk> talked about yesterday about how <unk> and <unk> <unk> to <unk> it is <unk> . It 's a <unk> of money .
I mean , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , it 's not just that they 're just <unk> .
They 're <unk> <unk> .
They 're going to be worse .
If a little bit of what we do is that in our society <unk> choice was <unk> in those where people have too few possibilities , it 's not just their life to <unk> but our <unk> .
This is what <unk> call a <unk> <unk> .
A <unk> of income does well -- not just the poor -- because of this choice in <unk> that we <unk> .
So , to <unk> : " You can become everything you want to be --
<unk> , people of culture , <unk> : " What do you get that ? "
" It 's <unk> that you can 't <unk> in a glass <unk> . "
" A <unk> imagination , a <unk> view of the world --
and I <unk> it like this , at the beginning .
But then , <unk> , instead , I realized that that 's a long <unk> .
Because the reality of the <unk> is that if you <unk> the <unk> , so that it 's not possible , " you can 't <unk> the freedom . You <unk> the <unk> .
If you <unk> the <unk> so that it 's <unk> as <unk> as well .
<unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Everybody needs a <unk> .
This is almost certainly too <unk> , maybe even for the fish , and certainly for us .
But the <unk> of some <unk> <unk> is a <unk> <unk> and , <unk> , for <unk> .
Thank you so much .
