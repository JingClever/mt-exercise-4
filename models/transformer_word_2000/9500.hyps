The last year I showed these <unk> for <unk> that the <unk> <unk> <unk> , which for almost three million years had the size of the United States <unk> , <unk> , it 's <unk> 40 percent .
And I 'm going to <unk> the <unk> of the problem because it 's not <unk> the ice <unk> .
<unk> <unk> is , in a sense , the heart <unk> of climate system .
They <unk> <unk> and <unk> in the summer .
The next next <unk> is going to be a <unk> <unk> on the last 25 years .
<unk> <unk> are <unk> in red .
As you see , you 're going to go to the blue <unk> .
That 's the ice in <unk> , which is the ice in <unk> .
You can see that the ice <unk> ice , five years or <unk> , is like the blood , which here is from the body .
In 25 years , it 's <unk> .
This is a problem because the <unk> <unk> <unk> around the ocean where there are enormous <unk> of <unk> that , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , are <unk> in <unk> .
<unk> at the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , the amount of <unk> <unk> , this point of not <unk> .
In some <unk> , I 'm going to <unk> the <unk> is already <unk> by the water .
The <unk> <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> ! Al <unk> : She 's good . The question is , if we 're going to <unk> .
That 's why this <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> from the north .
This is a river in <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> never had <unk> levels .
This is the <unk> river , in the <unk> of <unk> .
If you want to know how the <unk> level of the sea <unk> <unk> on <unk> , here is where the sea .
These <unk> are <unk> <unk> .
And on the other hand of the planet : <unk> , the largest <unk> of the ice on the planet .
And the <unk> month , the ice <unk> <unk> is in <unk> , and that the <unk> <unk> , which <unk> on some <unk> <unk> , is particularly <unk> in <unk> .
<unk> at six feet level of the <unk> , like in <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , and a few years ago were <unk> .
<unk> percent of the world population <unk> water from that <unk> .
<unk> : This <unk> is the source of water <unk> of this city .
The <unk> is <unk> .
But when we <unk> , the same happens to the water .
In California , <unk> on the <unk> <unk> is <unk> of 40 percent .
<unk> <unk> are in crisis .
<unk> , as you read , they 're <unk> .
<unk> <unk> in the world door to a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> are <unk> to a normal <unk> out of the normal and without <unk> .
<unk> times over the last 30 years than the <unk> <unk> .
This is a <unk> of all <unk> .
If you look at the <unk> context , if you can see the <unk> .
In the last five years we 've been <unk> 70 million <unk> of CO2 every day .
Look at the <unk> area , from <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , and both parts of the <unk> <unk> , where there 's a <unk> <unk> of oxygen in the oceans .
The <unk> of global warming , together to <unk> , which is 20 percent , is the use of <unk> <unk> .
The oil is a problem , and the <unk> is even even worse .
The United States is one of two countries with <unk> emissions , together .
And they 're trying to build a lot of other <unk> <unk> .
But we 're <unk> to a <unk> of direction .
These are the <unk> projects in the last last and some <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
And then there 's a <unk> politics in our country .
The <unk> of <unk> and oil have <unk> million dollars in the last year to <unk> the <unk> <unk> , which is a <unk> .
I 'm going to <unk> something --
<unk> <unk> , where I live , there was a <unk> of <unk> billion <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
You 've seen it on the <unk> .
This is the second largest flow of <unk> in America .
It 's happened around <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> of one of the <unk> <unk> was this .
<unk> : <unk> â™« <unk> <unk> is a kind of <unk> and happy .
It 's <unk> here in America , and it <unk> our economy .
<unk> the <unk> is more <unk> .
It 's <unk> price , and <unk> <unk> <unk> it .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> .
The largest society <unk> on the <unk> is <unk> <unk> . This is his <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> : <unk> <unk> -- Al <unk> , <unk> <unk> -- not know what they 're talking about .
<unk> : So the <unk> for the <unk> of <unk> <unk> has <unk> two <unk> .
This is one of them , a part .
<unk> : <unk> : <unk> <unk> , we see the <unk> changes as a <unk> <unk> to our business .
For this is <unk> a big amount of money in a <unk> <unk> to make it <unk> to make the truth and <unk> the truth on the <unk> .
In fact , the <unk> is not <unk> .
We think it 's <unk> -- it also also a good <unk> .
So we don 't know about climate change .
We could do it .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> : <unk> <unk> -- you 've heard a lot of it .
So I 'm going to <unk> a <unk> structure as it 's about <unk> <unk> .
<unk> ! <unk> are a little <unk> , but this is the sound of <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> is between the major <unk> of global global warming , but the <unk> technology that you see all .
And let 's look at a time , this is the <unk> technology .
<unk> : <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> to the economic issue and the national security .
<unk> : <unk> , America is in the crisis ; the national security , the <unk> crisis .
The <unk> that <unk> all : our <unk> <unk> <unk> , like <unk> <unk> and oil <unk> .
But , there 's a new <unk> , <unk> solution to <unk> .
<unk> America : 100 percent of energy <unk> , in 10 years .
A plan for <unk> America to work , more <unk> <unk> , and help help <unk> global <unk> .
<unk> , a solution that we could solve our problems .
<unk> America . <unk> .
<unk> : This is the last one .
<unk> : <unk> : It 's about <unk> energy to America .
One of the most <unk> ways to <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> that we <unk> our planet .
<unk> : The future is here . <unk> , the sun , a new network .
<unk> <unk> : <unk> <unk> for <unk> work .
<unk> : <unk> America . It 's time to be <unk> .
<unk> : A old old <unk> says , " If you want to go to go to the <unk> , you go to the only .
If you want to go away , you go to the <unk> . "
We have to go away , fast .
Thank you very much .
<unk> year at TED I did a <unk> on <unk> .
And I 'm going to try to <unk> how the machine works .
So , I 'm going to go . And the ones that the other time there were no scientific <unk> experiment ever <unk> -- <unk> miles of <unk> .
His task is to <unk> the conditions that were in the <unk> that were in the beginning of the universe -- until <unk> million times a second .
That 's just <unk> .
This is the machine <unk> .
And they <unk> these <unk> <unk> inside the <unk> .
This is what I work . It 's called <unk> -- it 's <unk> <unk> feet and it 's a <unk> <unk> .
This is an image of <unk> <unk> in building so you can see the <unk> .
The 10 <unk> of the last year we 've <unk> the machine for the first time .
And this picture was <unk> by <unk> .
It was because of <unk> <unk> in control .
It 's an image of the first <unk> of particles that had all been around <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , with a part of the <unk> , and <unk> particles inside the <unk> .
In other words , when I was <unk> the image , the <unk> <unk> , which is a big <unk> .
I don 't know if it was to <unk> us to get more or this , when somebody <unk> on Google and <unk> that the page was this .
That means we 've had a <unk> impact beyond that scientific impact .
And I was a problem with the machine , there was a problem with the machine , we had to these <unk> here -- these <unk> <unk> .
These <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> when the machine works at the <unk> <unk> .
Now , the <unk> between you 're going to <unk> the <unk> and <unk> , " It 's not true . I 'm too <unk> . "
And instead they can do it because when they 're very <unk> <unk> <unk> .
So , at least <unk> degrees , at a temperature <unk> at that of the space between stars , these <unk> can bring that <unk> .
In one of the <unk> between the <unk> of <unk> <unk> in <unk> , there was a <unk> <unk> .
So the <unk> <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
This was the result .
Now , this is more <unk> if you think that these <unk> <unk> <unk> more than 20 <unk> , and that 's <unk> about 30 <unk> .
They 're <unk> about 50 <unk> .
And we did .
We <unk> and <unk> .
They 're all <unk> to their <unk> place .
And we 're going to be the <unk> <unk> is going to be again .
And we <unk> it , and we try to get data to <unk> or <unk> , and we continue to find what the <unk> are the <unk> that <unk> the universe .
Now , of course , in some way , these <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> on the value of science and engineering <unk> . It 's easy to <unk> .
I think the fact that it 's so hard , the fact that it 's the value of things like <unk> .
I 'd like to end with the words of a <unk> <unk> , which , <unk> , which , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , his <unk> was Michael <unk> , he said , " It 's not <unk> for the human mind of the mind as the <unk> that ideas of science are <unk> , which our <unk> are <unk> , which are not <unk> in nature , <unk> <unk> , that are <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Thank you .
I want to start <unk> to <unk> when , from children , <unk> <unk> .
As <unk> and <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> is <unk> <unk> to the way that <unk> <unk> <unk> the world around us .
So , from <unk> <unk> from the <unk> of our <unk> with <unk> <unk> , and my <unk> <unk> <unk> , and my <unk> <unk> <unk> , I started to <unk> : " And if we use a computer , instead of having the only <unk> as a <unk> that <unk> on a <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
and <unk> to our <unk> ?
The question was so interesting that I 'm going to try to explore the answer , building the <unk> .
In a few words , a <unk> is a big computer as a <unk> .
In a few words , a <unk> is a big computer as a <unk> .
You can <unk> with the hand , they can <unk> them , and they can <unk> their own movement and have a radio <unk> .
But <unk> , they 're <unk> objects , like <unk> , you can just <unk> it .
The <unk> are the example of a new <unk> of tools to <unk> information .
And as as <unk> as <unk> , <unk> of the <unk> movement , of the other , of the other , and they become more <unk> , <unk> of their <unk> , and <unk> of how we can <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
I 'm going to <unk> with some simple example .
This <unk> is <unk> to show you video : if you <unk> it in a direction , the video <unk> so , if you 're going to go back to the other hand hand back .
These <unk> <unk> are <unk> .
If you <unk> them , they 're going to <unk> what they 're around .
If they <unk> it , and they can <unk> it a little bit .
If they <unk> it , and they can <unk> it a little bit .
They also <unk> their movement and <unk> .
And then we realize that one of the interesting <unk> of the <unk> was that we could use common <unk> on the data , for example , " <unk> " a color as if it was a <unk> .
In this case , we have three <unk> <unk> as a <unk> of <unk> and I can <unk> to <unk> for <unk> of the color in the central one , where you 're <unk> .
and I can <unk> to <unk> the color in the central one , where you 're <unk> .
And we can <unk> too , we can <unk> a little bit about it .
I 'm also <unk> to <unk> , how the <unk> , the math and games where people can try the <unk> things , and they <unk> the results that are quickly , and they <unk> the results immediately .
I 'm going to --
This is a sequence of <unk> that I do with a <unk> program .
Here we have a words that 's <unk> in half of <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> , at every <unk> <unk> a letter to <unk> on every <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , at every <unk> , and <unk> a letter <unk> , and while I was <unk> <unk> in a <unk> .
Then , after about 30 seconds , and you have a new <unk> of <unk> and new possibilities to try .
Thank you .
So , here 's children <unk> in <unk> at <unk> <unk> , I did that <unk> them and I <unk> them a video .
They 're very <unk> .
And one of the interesting things about this kind of <unk> is that you have to <unk> a lot of <unk> .
I just say , " <unk> of the words , and they know exactly what to do .
So here 's other people who <unk> it .
This is our <unk> <unk> <unk> , there on the right .
It wanted to <unk> .
They were only <unk> , for him .
Now , this is a <unk> of a <unk> <unk> .
And I wanted to build a tool for the <unk> of <unk> . He 's <unk> .
It can <unk> new characters in the scene , <unk> their <unk> .
It can <unk> new characters in the scene , <unk> their <unk> .
So , it 's going to get out the sun .
<unk> : The sun is <unk> .
David <unk> : Now he brought a <unk> in the scene .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> .
<unk> ! !
So , <unk> <unk> and <unk> can <unk> the characters --
<unk> : <unk> !
<unk> their story .
<unk> : <unk> !
<unk> : It 's a final story with open , and it can decide him as you <unk> .
<unk> : It 's a final story with open , and it can decide him as you <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> .
<unk> : The last example I 've got time to show you is a recent <unk> , and <unk> music .
It 's a recent tool , by <unk> and <unk> music .
The <unk> here is <unk> as the bottom , and the <unk> .
And you have four different <unk> , and you can choose what to use .
You can also <unk> these <unk> in a sequence from <unk> to <unk> your <unk> .
And I just <unk> by doing a " sound " and a sequence . "
These are effects that you can control out of the live , and the <unk> .
I 'm going to <unk> it to a particular sound and then <unk> for <unk> .
And then there are the effects effects of time and <unk> , which is <unk> to the entire sequence .
<unk> like it works .
<unk> : <unk> : <unk> <unk> a <unk> in two <unk> <unk> , " <unk> in a series , the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> another <unk> .
Now , you 're going to go down .
<unk> : <unk> : Now , I 'm going to <unk> <unk> --
<unk> : <unk> : And now I 'm going to <unk> the <unk> to the <unk> , so I can control the effect of the alive .
<unk> : <unk> : I can <unk> the entire <unk> <unk> time from one side or another .
<unk> : <unk> : And now we 're going to <unk> the bottom to give more <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> : I can <unk> the sequence of the <unk> .
So I don 't have to <unk> before , but I can <unk> , <unk> more , or more <unk> .
And now , I finally can <unk> the whole <unk> <unk> <unk> on the left <unk> .
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is building new <unk> <unk> <unk> more <unk> to how our brain work and body .
And today , I 've had time to show you one of the results of this way , and also some <unk> that we try to get out of the lab .
And the concept I want to <unk> is that that 's going to be <unk> this new generation of objects to <unk> the <unk> media , which <unk> information in our world in the way we want .
Thank you very much .
I don 't see the time to talk to all of you .
I 'm a <unk> .
And I 'm going to be books , but it 's more than that , of course .
It 's also love and the <unk> of my life .
And I don 't look like that it can change .
But , I said , something particular is happened in my life and my career , which brought me to <unk> the whole whole relationship with this work .
The particular thing is that I wrote about this book , this <unk> called " <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and some reason why I 'm going to be <unk> in the world and <unk> a big , <unk> <unk> .
And the result is that everywhere I 'm going to <unk> people like I was <unk> .
<unk> -- <unk> , <unk> !
I 'm going to be <unk> and they say , " You don 't be able to do it better than you do ?
You don 't know to keep going to write for the life without <unk> to be able to create a book that can <unk> to somebody ? "
What can you get to somebody ? "
It 's <unk> , you know .
But it could go worse , and I remember that more than 20 years ago , when I was saying to people -- I was a <unk> -- I wanted to be a <unk> .
I 'm going to <unk> the same <unk> <unk> .
And people said , " Don 't you know that I 'm not going to be successful ?
You don 't know that the <unk> <unk> <unk> you ?
You don 't fear to do this <unk> for all the life without anything that you 've ever been out and to die on a <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> ? "
So , you know .
The answer -- the short answer to all these questions is : " Yes . "
Yeah , I 'm afraid of all of these things .
I 've always had fear .
And I 'm also a lot of other things that people don 't <unk> .
As the <unk> and other things .
But , how do you know , I thought , and I 'm going to <unk> <unk> is why ?
Is it <unk> ?
It 's <unk> that anyone who who <unk> to be <unk> by a work that you feel <unk> to do .
But what is that , in the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> about health <unk> <unk> about <unk> <unk> in a way that other <unk> don 't do ?
How did I father , for example , he was a <unk> <unk> , and I remember one time in his 40 years of activity in which the age of the <unk> that the <unk> was asked to be <unk> <unk> ?
And that <unk> of John <unk> , how do you know , what is it going to ?
<unk> 't you know , <unk> ?
<unk> , the engineers like group , they have no <unk> , in <unk> , <unk> the <unk> of being <unk> <unk> .
We <unk> , we have enough this <unk> , and not only <unk> , but <unk> of all these kinds of <unk> , we have this <unk> of being <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And we don 't want to look at the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that , only in the <unk> century , <unk> young and often to their .
And the ones that don 't seem to be really <unk> by their <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , before I was die , in the last <unk> said , " Every book , he had me a little more " <unk> about work in their life .
But we don 't <unk> when we say , because we heard these things so long that we have completely <unk> and <unk> the <unk> that creativity and <unk> the <unk> that creativity and <unk> are in some way to <unk> and the art , at the end , and the art , at the end , and the art , at the end , and the <unk> , at the <unk> .
And the question I want to <unk> to all here is : you 're all the right thing ?
So , you know , because it 's also <unk> by a <unk> distance to me not good for anything like this <unk> .
I think it 's <unk> .
And I think it 's also <unk> , and I don 't want to <unk> in the next century .
I think it 's better <unk> our big <unk> to live .
And I certainly know , in my case -- it would be very <unk> to start <unk> to start to <unk> to <unk> at that <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in which I 'm in my career .
<unk> -- look at , I 'm pretty young , I 'm pretty young years .
I still have about four <unk> of work in me .
And it 's very <unk> that anything <unk> in now , it 's going to be <unk> from the world as the work that <unk> after the <unk> success of my last book .
<unk> <unk> , because we 're all more or less friends here -- it 's <unk> that my greatest success is to my <unk> .
Oh , <unk> , that thought !
You know , the kind of thinking that brings a person to start <unk> at <unk> <unk> at nine <unk> at the morning and I don 't want to do it .
I love to continue to do this work that I love .
So , the question is it to be , how ?
And so I think , after many <unk> , which the way to be able to work to continue to write it is to create a <unk> <unk> <unk> , OK ?
I have to find a <unk> distance between me , which I 'm <unk> , and my natural <unk> that I 'm <unk> , and my natural <unk> that I 'm going to get all last year in how to do we look through the time , trying to find other society to find some more <unk> .
about how to help people <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of creativity .
And that research brought me to the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
I 'm going to go back and then <unk> back back .
<unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> -- people don 't believe that creativity <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> -- OK ?
It <unk> that creativity was this <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> to men from a some <unk> <unk> and <unk> , for reasons and <unk> , for reasons and <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> of these <unk> <unk> <unk> of creativity .
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> to have a <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> from <unk> .
The <unk> were the same idea , but <unk> that species of the spirit of the spirit without a <unk> .
And the <unk> , because the <unk> didn 't really really <unk> that a <unk> was somebody particularly smart .
And I think that a <unk> was this kind of <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> literally in the <unk> of a <unk> artist , and that <unk> out out of <unk> <unk> the work of the artist and <unk> out the <unk> of that work .
And the <unk> is the distance of which I 'm talking about -- that <unk> <unk> you from the results of your work .
And all of <unk> that was so <unk> , right ?
So artists were <unk> by <unk> things , like , for example , the too <unk> , you know , you know ?
If your work was <unk> not to <unk> all the <unk> , all of <unk> that <unk> state of this <unk> <unk> .
If your work <unk> , it wasn 't all your <unk> , right ?
All you know that was your <unk> to be a <unk> .
And so people <unk> creativity in <unk> for a long time .
And then the <unk> <unk> and all <unk> , and we <unk> this big idea ; we put the human <unk> on the center of the universe , and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk>
This was the principle of <unk> <unk> and people to think that creativity is completely <unk> by <unk> .
And for the first time in history , they <unk> to <unk> this or that artist as a rather <unk> to a <unk> person with <unk> .
And I have to <unk> , I think it was a big <unk> .
I think I 'm going to ask somebody , a simple person to believe that I 'm like a <unk> like the source , the <unk> and <unk> of all the <unk> , <unk> and <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> it is a <unk> <unk> to <unk> .
It 's like to ask somebody to <unk> the sun .
<unk> and <unk> the <unk> and create all these <unk> <unk> on the <unk> .
And I think it was that pressure to have <unk> artists in the <unk> 500 years .
And , if this is true , and I think it 's , the question is , and now ?
Can we do it <unk> ?
I 'm going to go back to a more <unk> than the relationship between humans and <unk> <unk> .
Or maybe no .
We may not be <unk> 500 years of <unk> thinking in a 18 minutes .
And there 's probably people in the audience who <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> on the <unk> of <unk> , <unk> , do that <unk> people <unk> <unk> on their projects .
You probably don 't <unk> all about this thing .
But the question I 'd like to <unk> is -- why ?
Why don 't you do it ?
Because it 's more than any other thing that you 've ever heard about to explain the <unk> of the <unk> process .
A process that , as anyone who ever <unk> to do something -- so , we 're all here -- you know , you don 't <unk> <unk> .
And , in fact , it can be completely <unk> .
I did this <unk> <unk> with the extraordinary <unk> <unk> , which has now 90 years , but it was a <unk> for life , and he said that during his <unk> in the <unk> <unk> , <unk> out in the <unk> <unk> , <unk> out in the <unk> , and the <unk> it , inside of the <unk> .
And he said that was like a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And that <unk> <unk> to <unk> .
And he was <unk> , because he had <unk> the earth under his feet .
I 'm going to have only one thing to do , and it was , words , " <unk> like a <unk> . "
And so they <unk> to home and it was <unk> by this <unk> , and it didn 't have to get another piece of paper and a enough enough <unk> , while , <unk> and <unk> on the page .
And sometimes I didn 't get enough to be enough , and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> without able to get home and <unk> <unk> and <unk> it would have to <unk> through the <unk> and would have <unk> to <unk> through the <unk> , looking for , and he would be <unk> with <unk> , and he would be <unk> with <unk> and <unk> and would have <unk> to <unk> through the <unk> and would have <unk>
Then there were those times -- this piece never <unk> -- there were moments when the <unk> was almost <unk> , right ?
So , he was <unk> at home and he was trying to <unk> the <unk> through , and he was <unk> a <unk> right in the while he was <unk> , and then said , he was like , if you were <unk> with the other hand and <unk> .
<unk> the tail and the <unk> in his body and the <unk> on the page .
And in these cases , the <unk> would be <unk> on the <unk> page and <unk> , but at the <unk> , the last word at the first word .
So when I <unk> it -- it 's <unk> , it 's exactly <unk> to my <unk> process .
I don 't have my <unk> process -- I 'm not a <unk> !
I 'm a <unk> , and my way to <unk> is ; I 'm going to <unk> all day and work and <unk> on <unk> .
But even me in my <unk> , I 've been <unk> against that thing , sometimes .
And I think that 's a lot of you have the <unk> .
You know , even though the work and ideas <unk> me <unk> to <unk> from a certain source I can 't <unk> <unk> .
And what is this thing ?
And how can we <unk> it in order to do not <unk> our head , but rather , what would we do <unk> <unk> <unk> ?
For how I 'm about , the best example I have is the <unk> <unk> <unk> , which I 've been <unk> years ago for a <unk> .
And I 'm talking about this , and you know , <unk> , for the <unk> of life was the <unk> artist <unk> , trying to control , <unk> these species of <unk> <unk> <unk> .
But then I <unk> , and a day when he was <unk> on a <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> everything for him .
<unk> fast and all of a <unk> <unk> , and all of a <unk> <unk> , which comes into his head as the <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , and they want , you know , it 's wonderful , and the <unk> , but it doesn 't know how to <unk> .
It 's not a piece of paper , it 's not a <unk> , it doesn 't have a <unk> .
So it starts to feel this kind of old <unk> <unk> <unk> in him , and I 'm going to <unk> it , and <unk> <unk> <unk> from this song song .
I 'm not enough to <unk> and I can 't <unk> . "
And instead of going to go to the <unk> , they <unk> .
And he <unk> the whole process and made something completely new .
He just <unk> the sky and said , " <unk> , you don 't see that I 'm <unk> ? "
" It seems to write you a song now ?
If you really want to <unk> , you 're going to be <unk> when I 'm going to take care of you .
<unk> , <unk> to <unk> <unk> .
They 're going to <unk> <unk> <unk> . "
And his process <unk> <unk> after this .
I work , the work was still <unk> as always <unk> .
But the process , and the <unk> that was <unk> when I was <unk> when I <unk> the <unk> , the <unk> that was out of he <unk> , and they <unk> it back from where , <unk> that had no <unk> .
But I 'm going to <unk> this , wonderful <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and this thing that <unk> and <unk> that , but it wasn 't <unk> .
So , how I 'm going to change that story to change a little way that I 'm going to <unk> and I 've already <unk> me .
This idea , I was <unk> when I was <unk> , " <unk> , " and I 'm going to go to a <unk> of those <unk> in which we 're working on something , and we don 't start with it , and you can start thinking that 's going to be the book that 's going to be the book .
Not just <unk> , just the <unk> book .
And I try to think about <unk> this project .
But then I 'm going to <unk> the air and <unk> us .
So I <unk> my face on the <unk> and <unk> my <unk> at a <unk> <unk> in the room .
And I said to <unk> , " <unk> , what if this book is not going to be <unk> , I 'm going to be <unk> , don 't it ?
Because you see I 'm going to <unk> everything I have , I have no longer than that .
So if you want it to be better , you have to do your part .
OK . But if you don 't do it , you know what , I 'm not going to do .
I 'm going to write the same because it 's my work .
And I would like to be <unk> that I 'm <unk> to do my part of them to do my part . " Because at the end is so , OK -- <unk> does in the <unk> of Africa , the <unk> of the moon , <unk> , and <unk> <unk> , which <unk> <unk> <unk> for hours to <unk> .
And they were always <unk> , because the <unk> were <unk> and were <unk> .
But every long , <unk> , something <unk> , and one of these <unk> artists actually actually <unk> .
And I know what I 'm talking about , because I know that you 've all seen , at some point , a <unk> like this .
It was like the time , and the <unk> <unk> through a kind of <unk> and it was not doing anything different than the <unk> , like the <unk> <unk> <unk> before , but everything was <unk> .
And it 's not just to <unk> as a human .
But they <unk> out of <unk> and <unk> in the fire <unk> .
And when this <unk> , the time , people <unk> what was was , <unk> with his name .
<unk> your hands and <unk> to <unk> , " <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , God , God , " God , "
That 's God , you know .
I 'm going to <unk> -- when the <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> this <unk> with them and <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> , " <unk> , " <unk> , " <unk> , " <unk> , " <unk> , " which you can still feel in the <unk> or <unk> .
In <unk> , when a artist did something impossible and <unk> , " <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , " <unk> , <unk> -- a <unk> of God .
And it 's <unk> because we need .
But the problem comes the day after , for the <unk> same , when you <unk> and <unk> that are 11 <unk> and <unk> it that are 11 <unk> and <unk> God 's not <unk> .
It 's just a <unk> with a great <unk> to <unk> , and maybe never <unk> to <unk> at that <unk> .
And maybe nobody <unk> the name of God still as <unk> , and what does it have to do with the rest of his life ?
It 's hard .
This is one of the most <unk> <unk> to do in a <unk> life .
But maybe it 's not to be so <unk> if you 're <unk> to <unk> , <unk> , that the <unk> <unk> of your being being being being from you .
But I just <unk> that you 're <unk> data from a <unk> source of this <unk> part of your life that you have to get to <unk> .
And , you know , if we think about this way change .
And so I started to <unk> , and it 's certainly like I 've been <unk> for several months during the <unk> of the book that I 'm going to soon , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> of my <unk> success .
And what I have to continue to <unk> when I feel <unk> by this is , not <unk> .
You don 't <unk> . You just <unk> your work .
You 're going to <unk> for your side , any <unk> can be .
If your work is <unk> , <unk> .
If the <unk> , you 're going to <unk> <unk> <unk> some kind of <unk> <unk> , for a <unk> moment through your <unk> , then , " <unk> ! "
<unk> , you do the same <unk> .
And " <unk> ! " <unk> ! "
I think , and I think it 's <unk> .
" <unk> ! " <unk> ! " <unk> ! " <unk> for having <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Thank you .
Thank you .
<unk> : <unk> !
As you know , I 've talked about some of these projects on the human genome , what it can <unk> and <unk> about discovery new genes .
Now we 're going to <unk> a new way : we started to <unk> biology , and now start from that digital code in a new <unk> of biology , <unk> and <unk> life .
We 've always been trying to <unk> big questions .
" <unk> is life ? " It 's something that many <unk> I think have <unk> to understand at levels .
We 've tried different <unk> , <unk> to <unk> terms .
We 're going to be <unk> for about 20 years .
When we <unk> the human genome <unk> to go from the world of biology in the computer world 's digital .
Now , we can we <unk> life , or create new life from this digital universe ?
This is the map of a little <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , which is the species from the <unk> genome that can <unk> in the lab .
And we tried to reduce <unk> the genome to <unk> a <unk> as a little bit more .
We 're able to <unk> a <unk> of <unk> about 500 genes that are here .
But when we take a look at his <unk> map , it 's very simple than our .
<unk> , this is simple .
But when we look at all the genes that we can <unk> , one at the time , is very <unk> that this can bring a <unk> cell .
So I think the only <unk> on the only way to <unk> this <unk> way to <unk> the <unk> to <unk> some of these questions .
So we started the <unk> of " <unk> , " Can we <unk> a <unk> ? "
Can you have chemistry to produce these big molecules that we never have been able to create before ?
And , in case , we can we <unk> to work a <unk> ?
A <unk> is just a piece of <unk> <unk> material .
The speed that we 're able to <unk> life is <unk> to <unk> <unk> .
Our ability to write the <unk> code , instead of <unk> <unk> , but it 's <unk> .
And our <unk> <unk> the <unk> on a <unk> <unk> .
We 've got more 15 years ago .
The process has <unk> a lot of <unk> , <unk> with a <unk> <unk> before <unk> the <unk> experiments .
But we discovered that <unk> is very hard .
There are thousands of machines in the world that <unk> little <unk> of DNA , <unk> of <unk> <unk> , and it 's a <unk> process : the <unk> is the <unk> , more <unk> there are .
So we had to develop a new way to <unk> these <unk> and <unk> the <unk> .
And this was our first <unk> , to start <unk> information <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
It 's a small virus that <unk> bacteria .
We designed the <unk> , <unk> the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> a DNA <unk> of <unk> about <unk> <unk> .
The interesting part is when we took this piece of <unk> <unk> <unk> and we <unk> it in bacteria , the bacteria have <unk> to read this <unk> code and <unk> the <unk> particles .
The particles <unk> are <unk> by cells , they 're <unk> back and have <unk> <unk> .
I 've talked about recently with members of the <unk> industry that they have certainly <unk> this model .
They have more than you .
And I think that 's a situation where software can actually build his <unk> in a <unk> system .
But we do the largest things in the big .
They wanted to build the whole <unk> of <unk> .
They 're more than <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
So we thought I was going to <unk> in the size of the virus , so that we can change the <unk> to understand what are the <unk> of a <unk> cell .
The <unk> is <unk> , and if you <unk> information in a computer , these being very <unk> .
When I was the first time in the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> was a <unk> for every 10 <unk> <unk> .
We discovered , 30 <unk> . If we used that original sequence that original sequence never been able to do it work .
A part of the process is to design <unk> 50 <unk> that <unk> with all the other <unk> of 50 <unk> to build <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> elements here .
You 've probably read that <unk> us in the <unk> .
So , we have a <unk> code on four <unk> : <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
And I 'm going to talk about 20 <unk> , and there 's a <unk> order to <unk> for every <unk> .
So we can use the <unk> code to write words , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
What we did we have done at the beginning was <unk> .
Some of the <unk> were <unk> by the fact that it wasn 't <unk> .
We designed these <unk> to <unk> just <unk> with <unk> .
There are <unk> that <unk> them and <unk> them .
And we started to <unk> <unk> <unk> .
But at every step , we 've made these <unk> in <unk> <unk> , and we 're trying to create a very <unk> <unk> , as you 're going to see in a minute .
We 're trying to <unk> the process .
So , this seems the <unk> of a <unk> <unk> .
When we were <unk> to these <unk> much more than 100 <unk> <unk> , not <unk> directly in the <unk> <unk> .
You get to the <unk> of the <unk> biology .
So we 've got some other <unk> .
And I 'm going to talk about another <unk> called <unk> <unk> , which in biology <unk> to <unk> DNA <unk> .
Here 's an example .
This <unk> , called <unk> <unk> , can <unk> three million <unk> of <unk> .
You can see in the <unk> <unk> as his <unk> is <unk> .
In 12 hours -- it 's <unk> exactly like it was before .
<unk> thousands of organisms that are able to do it .
These organisms can completely <unk> .
They 're going to live <unk> .
They are absolutely sure that life <unk> in space , and they <unk> to find new <unk> <unk> of water .
And at the <unk> , NASA has shown that this is .
This is an image of the <unk> that we 've built with these <unk> , just using these <unk> , just using the <unk> design <unk> .
<unk> <unk> them <unk> .
This image was not <unk> with a <unk> <unk> , but with a <unk> <unk> .
It 's a <unk> so big that we can <unk> with a <unk> <unk> .
These are pictures that <unk> a <unk> of about six seconds .
This is the <unk> that we did a little time ago .
They 're more than <unk> <unk> code .
It 's the largest <unk> of a <unk> structure ever <unk> .
It 's got a <unk> <unk> <unk> to 300 million .
If you <unk> it with a 10 <unk> without spaces , we will <unk> pages to <unk> this <unk> code .
Now , how do we do it work ?
<unk> , through a virus is a kids from the kids .
It 's a little bit more <unk> when you use bacteria .
It 's <unk> simple cells when it 's about <unk> cells as our : you can just <unk> the <unk> and <unk> another , which is basically the process of <unk> .
In <unk> , the <unk> <unk> is instead of <unk> inside the cell , but we 've <unk> <unk> that we 're able to do a <unk> <unk> of a <unk> from a cell to another and <unk> .
We have a <unk> <unk> from a kind of <unk> .
<unk> are different as as men from <unk> .
We have some <unk> <unk> in more way to decide what you could choose to <unk> what you can choose to <unk> what you to choose .
And then he <unk> with the <unk> <unk> <unk> all the <unk> .
And when we put it in the cell was <unk> and <unk> our <unk> <unk> , the new <unk> went back into the cell .
And I 'm going to be <unk> that we don 't go beyond , but we tried to get more in there .
This is one of the largest <unk> of evolution .
We found that <unk> species have <unk> a second or a third <unk> , or a third <unk> of a few <unk> in the <unk> of the new species .
So who think about evolution as a only <unk> at time that <unk> didn 't have any <unk> of biology .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> that was in the cell not <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> that we <unk> it .
It 's <unk> , and he <unk> the other <unk> as <unk> material , and it 's <unk> , and we <unk> with only the cell and the new <unk> .
It 's become blue because of the genes that we 've <unk> .
And in a short <unk> of time , all the <unk> of a species are <unk> , and it 's <unk> of all over a new species , <unk> on the software , which we 've <unk> in the cell .
All the <unk> are <unk> , the <unk> are <unk> , and when you get the code <unk> <unk> exactly what we 've <unk> .
Now , this may be <unk> <unk> , but we <unk> the software , but we <unk> the DNA can change things in a <unk> <unk> .
Now , I 've already <unk> that here is not talking about <unk> -- but it 's <unk> to start from three million years and a half years of evolution , and I 've already said that maybe we 're going to create a new version of the <unk> that we 're <unk> new species on this process .
Why do that ?
I think it 's enough to <unk> when we think about our <unk> .
We 're going to go from six and a half billion people to <unk> billion in the next 40 years .
Right , to give you a example : I was born in <unk> .
Now there are three people on the planet to <unk> in <unk> <unk> ; in 40 years , there will be four .
We 're <unk> problems now at find food , <unk> and <unk> , <unk> and <unk> for six billion people .
And we 're going to do it for nine billion .
<unk> than five billion <unk> , more than 30 billion <unk> <unk> <unk> .
That means percent million <unk> a day .
When we try to find <unk> <unk> , or any kind of process to <unk> , it will be a huge challenge .
In the most we have to realize the whole <unk> of CO2 from these materials that <unk> in the atmosphere .
At day , I 'm going to talk about the <unk> <unk> around the world , we have a <unk> with about 20 million genes , and I like to think that are the <unk> <unk> for the future .
The <unk> industry is just a <unk> about <unk> , and think about how many different things are <unk> out .
Our <unk> are <unk> data from the <unk> reality and our imagination .
Now we have <unk> , because of these <unk> <unk> <unk> , and that we 're going to create what we call <unk> <unk> .
We 're able to build a big robot that can produce a million <unk> a day .
Think of these 20 million genes or <unk> to try to <unk> the <unk> to <unk> <unk> or <unk> , new <unk> , we can change , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , we can change , because of a small team , and create more biology now that 's the last 20 years of science .
And it 's just a standard <unk> .
We can choose to <unk> , chemistry or <unk> , chemistry or <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
This is a <unk> of some software software that we 're working on for being able to <unk> and design species to the computer .
Well , we don 't know how to be .
We know exactly what their <unk> code is .
We 're going to <unk> on the <unk> generation .
You 've seen that <unk> <unk> from <unk> was an experiment .
We have <unk> second and third generation that we 're going to be <unk> <unk> than the <unk> or different kinds of <unk> .
But the only way that biology can have a big impact without <unk> the cost of food and <unk> the cost of food and <unk> the <unk> would be <unk> the CO2 in matter before , where we 're working on to design cells that we can get to <unk> the first <unk> in about 18 months .
<unk> light <unk> with CO2 is a <unk> , but in our <unk> <unk> , we found different <unk> .
This is a <unk> that we 've <unk> in the <unk> .
<unk> in the ocean , at about <unk> feet at the <unk> temperature of <unk> water .
<unk> <unk> from CO2 using hydrogen <unk> as a energy source .
We 're trying to understand if we can <unk> CO2 , which can easily be <unk> through <unk> , <unk> that CO2 in <unk> , to drive this process .
So , we think we might be able to <unk> what the basic question of " that is that what is life is . We have <unk> , we have the <unk> goal of <unk> the whole industry .
<unk> . If you can 't do that TED , where can ?
It 's a main source of energy .
And we 're working with the same <unk> to use <unk> <unk> <unk> .
You saw this year with the flu , we 're always back to a year and with a dollar in less when it 's about find the right right .
I think what you can change building <unk> <unk> in <unk> .
So , this is how the future could start looking at <unk> , now , the tree of evolution , <unk> the evolution with bacteria <unk> , and then <unk> cells .
We are at the way to <unk> people .
Our purpose is to do enough to live enough to <unk> to try to try to try to try to try to <unk> it . Thank you very much .
First of all , I 'm going to show you , the <unk> <unk> possible , some fundamental work that we 've taken up to <unk> a <unk> almost a year ago .
It 's a environment where you can <unk> is to local level that you can <unk> with a huge amount of <unk> data .
Here we 're seeing <unk> <unk> <unk> with a kind of <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> , for a fast <unk> , <unk> the images like .
And it doesn 't matter how big it is the amount of information that we see , how big are these <unk> of data or images .
Most of them are common <unk> , but this for example is a <unk> <unk> from the <unk> of <unk> , and <unk> in the <unk> of 300 <unk> .
It doesn 't make any difference because the only thing that <unk> the <unk> of a system like this is the number of <unk> on your screen in any time . It 's a very <unk> architecture .
This is a whole book , example of data , no <unk> of images .
This is <unk> <unk> <unk> . Every <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And so it 's about <unk> and not images , we can do something like that , to see what this is a real <unk> of the text , not a picture of the text , not a picture .
It could be a way to read a little bit <unk> to read a <unk> book .
I don 't <unk> it .
This is a <unk> <unk> . It 's a <unk> number of <unk> .
Every image is the beginning of a <unk> .
And it really gives you the pleasure and the beautiful experience of read the real version of a <unk> or a <unk> , which is for nature a <unk> .
We 've also done something with the corner of this particular number of <unk> .
We created a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> than the one that you use in a normal <unk> , and we 've <unk> the <unk> content .
If you want to see the <unk> of this <unk> , you can see here .
Or others , or even the <unk> <unk> .
And this really <unk> some of these ideas to <unk> the <unk> of space on the screen .
And I think this <unk> to put it to the <unk> and other <unk> <unk> , not to be <unk> .
Of course , the <unk> is one of the most <unk> <unk> for this kind of technology .
And on this , I don 't want to lose time , if we don 't say we have <unk> to give them <unk> to <unk> this field .
These are all the streets in the United States <unk> , a <unk> image of NASA .
So now I 'm going to do something else .
This is actually actually live in the Web ; you can see it .
This is a project called <unk> , which <unk> two different technologies .
And the other is a <unk> <unk> and the other is a very interesting <unk> that was made by <unk> <unk> , a student of Washington , with help <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And it 's alive on the Web , <unk> <unk> .
You can <unk> when we do this kind of <unk> , where we can go from an image to the other and have this kind of experience to <unk> <unk> .
But the <unk> <unk> of images here has actually a meaning .
And the <unk> of <unk> have <unk> these images together , so that we 're <unk> to <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> in which the <unk> <unk> <unk> on the <unk> <unk> <unk> are <unk> . So you see the elements of the <unk> <unk> , and these things are all <unk> .
I don 't know if I have time to show you some other environment .
There are much more <unk> .
I want to go directly to one of the <unk> data , and this <unk> from a <unk> <unk> of <unk> that we did work for the first time . I 'm going to show show you what we 've really did is the key behind this technology , the <unk> . And it 's not <unk> to <unk> the <unk> that we 've got <unk> in the website .
We had to <unk> <unk> and so forth .
This is a <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> and <unk> images of types of kinds of <unk> , and <unk> images of types of kinds of <unk> , and and so on . And he 's a image that 's discovery <unk> .
So I 'm all <unk> images from <unk> and were all <unk> <unk> at the <unk> level in this way .
And it 's possible to <unk> this way .
You know , I would never have thought to end up to work for <unk> .
It 's very <unk> <unk> <unk> this kind of <unk> here .
I think I 'm going to see that this is a lot of different types of <unk> : from those <unk> <unk> <unk> , a <unk> number , <unk> together in this environment .
And if I can , I 'm trying to look at the <unk> .
A lot of them , etc .
And then , there 's a series of photographs -- <unk> -- <unk> .
This is a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
We can go from the physics of this environment .
The <unk> is that we can do with the social environment . This is now <unk> data from <unk> from the entire memory memory of how to <unk> the earth , from the point of view , <unk> , and <unk> all of those data together .
All of those pictures become <unk> together , more than the <unk> of the parts .
You have a model of the Earth that <unk> .
Think about this as the <unk> of the work of <unk> <unk> on Earth .
It 's something that <unk> in complexity as people <unk> it , and the <unk> for who are <unk> to the use of them .
Their picture are <unk> with <unk> <unk> from other people .
If somebody comes the idea of <unk> all these <unk> <unk> <unk> the name , my picture of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> all of those data , and I can use how to <unk> it in that space , by using the <unk> of anyone else , and have a social experience <unk> and <unk> .
Of course , a <unk> of all the interesting <unk> of every interesting part of the earth , <unk> not only from <unk> <unk> and <unk> images and <unk> and <unk> , but from <unk> .
Thank you very much .
CA : I understand ? What is what your software your software <unk> to do is that at some point , in the next years , all the photographs of the next few years , all the photographs of anyone who are <unk> in the world will be <unk> together ?
<unk> : Yes . What 's doing is doing is basically <unk> .
It 's creating <unk> , if you want , between images .
And it 's doing it in the <unk> of images .
The thing becomes very interesting thing is if you think about the <unk> of information that many of these <unk> images .
As a <unk> of images , you get a <unk> and the <unk> on the Web , it 's <unk> on the Web has a lot of information about images .
Now , what happens if that picture is going on on all your picture ?
So the amount of <unk> <unk> and the amount of <unk> that <unk> is really enormous . It 's a <unk> effect . It 's a <unk> effect of the network .
CA : <unk> , it 's really incredible .
<unk> : I 'm going to tell you very much .
One of the major <unk> when you <unk> and one of the <unk> research is that we can live in who don 't <unk> the <unk> <unk> , between who <unk> the <unk> <unk> , <unk> the <unk> <unk> , <unk> the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> the plants .
<unk> to think that <unk> <unk> <unk> still beyond the <unk> <unk> , or that the <unk> <unk> are still <unk> <unk> , or <unk> , or <unk> , <unk> , the <unk> <unk> still the <unk> <unk> , to <unk> the <unk> of <unk> , and that the idea that the world in which we live in which we don 't have any sense , but it 's just a <unk> of <unk> , but it 's just a <unk> of reality ,
And the <unk> of a particular <unk> of <unk> choices that our <unk> <unk> has done , or bad , many <unk> .
And , of course , all of course <unk> <unk> .
All of <unk> . All <unk> .
We 're <unk> to <unk> .
We have to deal with the death <unk> , so we don 't <unk> it , if you were <unk> and <unk> --
We all have art .
What <unk> is the particular <unk> of the song , the <unk> of <unk> , every culture .
It doesn 't matter that are the <unk> of <unk> , or <unk> <unk> <unk> , or <unk> <unk> <unk> , or <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , or a <unk> in the <unk> <unk> , or a <unk> in the heart of the <unk> .
He was my <unk> of journey in the <unk> a month ago , or a <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of <unk> , on the <unk> , the <unk> mother of the world .
All of these <unk> <unk> us that there are other ways of <unk> other ways of thinking , other ways to move in the world .
And if you 're going to be a moment , it 's a concept that can give you hope .
<unk> , the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> the world create a <unk> life and <unk> that <unk> the planet , and it 's important for the <unk> of the planet as the <unk> <unk> .
And you can think about this <unk> <unk> as a <unk> and you can <unk> the <unk> of all the <unk> , and you can <unk> the <unk> of all the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> in being by the human imagination .
The <unk> is the great <unk> of humanity .
It 's the <unk> of what we are and what we can be as as as <unk> species .
And <unk> the <unk> was <unk> <unk> <unk> was <unk> to <unk> and <unk> much faster .
<unk> <unk> , for example , <unk> that 50 percent of all the species was been or is on the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> because it 's <unk> , or -- in the <unk> <unk> -- in the <unk> diversity -- and you don 't even even even <unk> to the <unk> <unk> -- that of the <unk> diversity .
The <unk> of this is , of course , the <unk> <unk> .
When you 're <unk> <unk> <unk> on this planet .
A language is not only <unk> by a <unk> or a series of rules .
A language is the <unk> of the human spirit .
It 's the middle with which the <unk> of every culture comes in the world .
Every language is a forest of the mind , a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> of <unk> .
And of those <unk> <unk> <unk> , while we 're sitting here at least , at least half the <unk> is not <unk> in the <unk> of children .
They don 't get to <unk> kids , which means , unless you do something , which is already <unk> .
What 's more <unk> of being <unk> by the <unk> , of the <unk> , of the <unk> , of the <unk> , or <unk> the <unk> of <unk> or <unk> the <unk> of <unk> or <unk> the <unk> of <unk> or <unk> the <unk> of kids ?
This <unk> <unk> was <unk> of somebody in some part of the world every two weeks : every two weeks , a <unk> <unk> and <unk> with itself in the <unk> <unk> of a language .
And I know that somebody of you know , " <unk> 't that better . "
The world doesn 't be a better place if you 're all the same language ? " <unk> , then we 're all <unk> . <unk> .
<unk> <unk> .
And it means a <unk> thing that means not to talk about their language .
I 'd like to give you a journey through the <unk> --
a little journey in <unk> to give you a <unk> of what we 're <unk> .
Many of us <unk> that when I say , " different ways of <unk> <unk> , " I mean , very different ways of <unk> .
And so for example , this <unk> <unk> , the <unk> of <unk> , which <unk> <unk> at the <unk> of <unk> <unk> from the river <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> <unk> .
It 's a <unk> that 's not able to <unk> the blue color from the green because the time <unk> is <unk> in the forest , which <unk> the <unk> .
They have a <unk> language and a <unk> rule , " <unk> <unk> " : you have to <unk> a person who 's a different language .
And this has <unk> in the past <unk> , yet the <unk> is that in these <unk> families where they 're talking six or seven <unk> because of the <unk> <unk> <unk> nobody .
They were <unk> to listen and then you start talking about .
And I 've been <unk> one of the most interesting <unk> that I 've been in , the <unk> of <unk> <unk> , a incredible <unk> that had the first <unk> in <unk> .
In <unk> five <unk> have <unk> <unk> <unk> .
They did <unk> by the top photographs that <unk> them in <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> that this <unk> of the <unk> <unk> had never seen nothing <unk> .
They <unk> the <unk> <unk> , they <unk> the <unk> to the research of a form or a <unk> and , not <unk> , they have <unk> that <unk> <unk> , and they have <unk> the five <unk> with <unk> .
But <unk> not only <unk> <unk> .
They <unk> between them .
<unk> percent of the <unk> was <unk> by their own .
We 're <unk> eight <unk> and we found two cases of death , and when we were <unk> to know , they <unk> that one of them was so that he died , and then they <unk> it . And then they <unk> it .
The <unk> were able to recognize the animal <unk> from 40 <unk> and <unk> the species .
I was early <unk> , I was <unk> a really interesting task when my <unk> <unk> to <unk> me if I wanted to go to <unk> <unk> <unk> between <unk> society <unk> to the base of <unk> and <unk> <unk> , and <unk> of <unk> <unk> , and <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , and <unk> of the <unk> <unk> .
To give a sense of <unk> , I should understand culture and that <unk> is not <unk> <unk> .
It 's pretty much about a <unk> view of the world .
Very interesting .
If you ask you to <unk> the big <unk> of the world , what would you get ?
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> , etc .
A continent always <unk> out , thinking that Africa doesn 't have <unk> <unk> . And instead , and the <unk> is not the other than the <unk> of these <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> .
What makes the <unk> is the <unk> <unk> between life and death .
So the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> can be <unk> by the <unk> <unk> , <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> and <unk> <unk> to the <unk> in the way that for a short moment , the <unk> becomes the <unk> .
So , the <unk> <unk> to say , " <unk> <unk> <unk> you go to talk about God .
We <unk> in <unk> and God . "
And the <unk> that you 're <unk> , is the spirit that <unk> you , how can you get you <unk> out of the <unk> ?
So they <unk> to these incredible events : <unk> <unk> in the state of <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
I 've been <unk> with all the <unk> that I 've lived the most <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , in the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> of the <unk> civilization that once <unk> on the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> in <unk> , the <unk> <unk> on the <unk> <unk> that <unk> on the <unk> <unk> .
In a continent <unk> , this <unk> never been <unk> by <unk> .
And I 'm <unk> by a <unk> , but their <unk> is <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> to go away from families to three or four years , and they live <unk> in a world <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> for 18 years .
Two <unk> years old <unk> of nine years old <unk> for <unk> the nine months of <unk> that <unk> in the <unk> of the mother , now are <unk> in the <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
For this time , they 're <unk> to values that <unk> their <unk> , and their <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> -- or just to say the <unk> <unk> <unk> -- or to say the <unk> <unk> .
At the term of this incredible <unk> , they 're <unk> out and for the first time in their life , at age of 18 years , they see a <unk> . And in that moment of <unk> of <unk> <unk> , all of the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> of <unk> <unk> , everything they 're going to have to learn in theory , it 's <unk> . <unk> <unk> . <unk> <unk> : <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
" <unk> ? I 'm going to tell you .
It 's <unk> . Now , it 's going to be <unk> . "
They call the largest and they say that we , <unk> <unk> , we are the <unk> of the world .
This level of <unk> is extremely important .
When we think about <unk> <unk> and the environment <unk> and the old story of the <unk> <unk> , which is a <unk> concept in his <unk> or maybe <unk> <unk> and say that these <unk> are <unk> <unk> to the Earth .
<unk> <unk> are not <unk> <unk> <unk> .
There 's no space for these things in the <unk> of <unk> or in the <unk> of <unk> , but thank you at time and <unk> , have created a <unk> of Earth <unk> not on the concept of <unk> <unk> , but on a <unk> <unk> , but on a <unk> <unk> , the concept that the Earth can live only because it 's <unk> by human <unk> .
What does it mean ?
I mean that a <unk> of the <unk> that <unk> the mountain is a <unk> that <unk> its <unk> is going to be a <unk> <unk> , and it will have a different <unk> with the mountain or that place in a <unk> of the <unk> that <unk> a mountain is a <unk> <unk> <unk> to be <unk> .
which is the <unk> of one <unk> or a <unk> is <unk> .
What 's interesting is the <unk> that <unk> the relationship between the <unk> and the natural world .
I grew up in the <unk> <unk> <unk> that the <unk> <unk> to be <unk> .
And that <unk> me a human being different human being different from my friends who believe that <unk> are the <unk> of <unk> and the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> that live in the <unk> <unk> , <unk> that live in the <unk> <unk> .
If you try to <unk> that these <unk> can create different reality , we start to understand some of their <unk> <unk> . They 're going to be able to understand some of them .
I 've been <unk> this picture in <unk> in <unk> <unk> .
And you may have heard about the <unk> , the most powerful <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> .
What makes it fascinating <unk> is not the potential potential <unk> , but its <unk> . It 's <unk> by two elements .
On the side , this <unk> <unk> that <unk> a series of <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
And the only <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> a little bit about the <unk> , but it 's <unk> with the <unk> of a family <unk> said <unk> .
This <unk> <unk> <unk> , very similar to the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
If you 're going to see the <unk> <unk> <unk> , which make it a different <unk> of species , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And I 'm going to <unk> on the <unk> is a little bit like being <unk> by a <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> on a sea of electricity . It doesn 't create a <unk> of electricity .
I often <unk> with my <unk> , Richard <unk> <unk> , the man who <unk> was <unk> , with his discovery of <unk> <unk> in the <unk> .
<unk> my <unk> cannot tell you these <unk> as <unk> because if you 're done , you can 't tell nobody to be <unk> . <unk> . <unk> 't they can 't be <unk> because they 're <unk> by a <unk> that <unk> in <unk> , <unk> .
It 's possible to <unk> only <unk> if you could <unk> with other <unk> <unk> that <unk> .
Now , the <unk> <unk> that are in this <unk> are <unk> , the same kind of <unk> , the same kind of <unk> <unk> . <unk> question : in a <unk> of <unk> species of plants , how do these <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , not like that , but if you 're going to <unk> in this way , they create a <unk> version of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> ?
We use the big <unk> of <unk> and <unk> , which can <unk> <unk> .
But if you go to the <unk> , we <unk> , " <unk> " <unk> " <unk> " . "
What does it mean ?
This <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , which <unk> <unk> in the forest , and our eyes <unk> in the forest species .
If you <unk> how to <unk> their <unk> <unk> us , " <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , the rest of plants , the rest of the rest of them ? " I said , " No . "
The solution is : they take the <unk> <unk> in a moon , and <unk> <unk> with a different <unk> .
With this not <unk> <unk> , but it 's much more interesting than <unk> <unk> .
Now , [ <unk> ] the problem is that the ones of us that have heart <unk> <unk> them , but in some way to <unk> the <unk> of history than our real world , and <unk> .
In fact , the <unk> century , by 300 years , not <unk> <unk> for his <unk> or his <unk> <unk> , but rather like it was that we <unk> and <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> the <unk> of diversity of <unk> and <unk> of the planet . Now the problem is not the change .
All the <unk> through the <unk> have been <unk> in a new <unk> of life .
And the problem is not the technology .
<unk> <unk> have no <unk> to be <unk> when they put part and <unk> and <unk> so they have no <unk> to be <unk> when they put <unk> and <unk> .
It 's not the change or technology that <unk> the <unk> of <unk> . It 's the power .
The <unk> <unk> of <unk> .
And if you look at the world , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , if you 're going to <unk> .
They 're <unk> creatures , <unk> <unk> out of the <unk> forces that go beyond their <unk> <unk> .
And I think that <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> --
a <unk> <unk> <unk> , where you can see the <unk> <unk> , which has been <unk> in the forest to a generation ago , and now <unk> to the <unk> and the <unk> on the <unk> of <unk> , where you can see the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , where the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , where the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , where the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , where the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , where the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , where the <unk>
I 'm going to <unk> the <unk> with the <unk> <unk> to the forest .
Or in the case of <unk> , are the diseases that are <unk> with the discovery of <unk> .
If you <unk> on the <unk> of the <unk> , where I 'm doing a lot of research , you 'll see the <unk> <unk> of politics .
As the <unk> , the physics of a <unk> , is <unk> at the <unk> level , but the <unk> , the <unk> of the life of a <unk> , not only is <unk> , but <unk> <unk> in certain <unk> , because it 's part of <unk> .
And you cannot understand the <unk> of the <unk> until you go from the beginning .
I 'm going to <unk> miles in <unk> in China through the <unk> <unk> , <unk> with a young <unk> , but only at <unk> <unk> , I realized what there 's behind the <unk> that we 're behind .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> million people <unk> from the <unk> during the <unk> <unk> .
The father of this guy was <unk> at <unk> <unk> .
which means that it was <unk> at the time of Chinese <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> with <unk> <unk> in the <unk> that led to <unk> .
My mother was <unk> and his <unk> was to be <unk> .
It was brought to <unk> in <unk> at age age of two years <unk> under his <unk> because it didn 't have to live without him .
The <unk> , who did the same , was <unk> in <unk> <unk> .
A day he had <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> and , for this <unk> , was <unk> to the <unk> <unk> for seven years .
The pain of <unk> can be <unk> , but the spirit of the <unk> is from <unk> <unk> .
And then then , all <unk> to a choice .
How do you live in the <unk> world of <unk> or we want to <unk> the world of diversity ?
The big <unk> <unk> <unk> , before he was die , that his greatest fear was that , in our go to this <unk> view of the world , not only <unk> the whole <unk> of the human imagination to a <unk> of human imagination , <unk> to a <unk> <unk> that were other possibility .
And it 's <unk> to remember that our species is <unk> for <unk> years .
The <unk> <unk> , that <unk> us gave us agriculture , which <unk> us to the <unk> <unk> , <unk> the <unk> <unk> with the <unk> of <unk> , creating the <unk> <unk> , creating the <unk> of <unk> , and we 're talking about <unk> years ago .
The <unk> world has been <unk> 300 years .
The story <unk> , I don 't know that we have the answers to all the challenges that we 're going to <unk> in <unk> to come .
When these <unk> <unk> of the world is asked what it means to be human , <unk> with <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And it 's in these answers that we all <unk> the possibility of being what we are : a <unk> species , which has to <unk> that all the <unk> and all the <unk> can <unk> . And there are big moments of <unk> .
I 've been <unk> on the <unk> of the island of <unk> , when I went to <unk> <unk> with <unk> , and this man , <unk> , and this man , <unk> me the wonderful story of his <unk> .
The government <unk> is not always <unk> with the <unk> <unk> and in the ' <unk> for <unk> our <unk> , we 've <unk> them in <unk> .
The <unk> of this man <unk> <unk> .
The family , <unk> for his life , the <unk> all of the <unk> , and all of his <unk> .
We want to know that <unk> don 't <unk> the cold , <unk> it .
The <unk> of <unk> were made of <unk> fish <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> of this man didn 't <unk> at night or <unk> <unk> .
It 's <unk> on , it 's <unk> the <unk> <unk> and <unk> in their hand . When I did the <unk> , and I <unk> in your hand . When I did did it , they <unk> it .
He <unk> <unk> on the <unk> of this <unk> <unk> , and when <unk> <unk> <unk> , he <unk> a dog .
He <unk> the dog and created a <unk> , with the <unk> <unk> <unk> created a <unk> , has <unk> another dog , and it 's <unk> on <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
What 's going to talk about <unk> ?
<unk> <unk> government <unk> <unk> to <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of an area <unk> of <unk> <unk> , California and <unk> <unk> together .
It 's their new <unk> . It 's called <unk> .
It 's a <unk> <unk> . We all <unk> resources .
One <unk> of how a <unk> can <unk> with his <unk> .
And , I think it 's pretty <unk> at least at least who 's been in these <unk> <unk> of the planet , that they realize that they 're not <unk> at all .
For somebody is home .
<unk> <unk> of the human imagination that <unk> to the <unk> of the time . And for us all , the dreams of these children , as the dreams of our children , become part of the <unk> <unk> .
And we end , we 're <unk> <unk> we are <unk> that the <unk> never <unk> .
I think <unk> --
[ <unk> ] ] They 're not <unk> , but we believe that stories can change the world , and maybe we are the best <unk> to tell stories of the world . Every month our website <unk> <unk> <unk> million <unk> .
<unk> <unk> our <unk> <unk> .
Our <unk> are <unk> by millions of people .
Our work is <unk> in <unk> to bring our public in <unk> to bring our public places that <unk> from which <unk> <unk> from which <unk> <unk> on the <unk> of <unk> <unk> : the <unk> world 's <unk> <unk> : the <unk> world 's <unk> , and we have to find a <unk> life in a <unk> world .
where the <unk> of all the <unk> can <unk> to our <unk> <unk> .
Thank you .
I 'm going to talk about some of the things that I 've already heard about some other <unk> that you 've already heard and <unk> some <unk> <unk> , in the case , not <unk> them .
I 'd like to start with what I call " the <unk> <unk> <unk> . "
The <unk> <unk> of what ?
The <unk> <unk> of all the society <unk> <unk> . The <unk> <unk> <unk> : " If we want to <unk> the <unk> of our citizens " <unk> " <unk> . "
The reason is , on one side , in fact that the freedom is in itself a value , it 's <unk> , <unk> for humans .
And the other is that if we 're <unk> , each of us can act for what we 're going to do everything that we <unk> our <unk> , without no one who <unk> in our own own .
The way to <unk> the freedom is to <unk> choice .
<unk> people have , more <unk> , and more <unk> , and more is their <unk> , and more than their <unk> .
This , <unk> , it 's so <unk> in society that nobody <unk> <unk> in <unk> .
And it 's also <unk> <unk> in our lives .
I 'm going to show you some examples of what progress has made possible .
This is my <unk> . It 's not particularly big .
I 'm going to give me a simple note on the <unk> to <unk> .
In my <unk> , there are <unk> <unk> , without <unk> the 10 <unk> of <unk> <unk> and the 12 <unk> <unk> that you can buy for a huge number of <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> <unk> that nobody 's already <unk> in your <unk> .
That 's what <unk> is .
Then you go to the store store <unk> for <unk> : <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
And in this single store <unk> , there 's a big number of <unk> <unk> .
We can do six million different <unk> using the <unk> that there are only <unk> <unk> that there are only a store .
<unk> <unk> that there is <unk> .
<unk> : the world 's <unk> .
And once I was a child , you could get all the services <unk> <unk> , <unk> that were <unk> by <unk> <unk> .
They <unk> the phone , not <unk> it .
A <unk> of that , the <unk> was that the phone never <unk> .
These days are gone .
We 've got a <unk> <unk> <unk> , especially between the phones .
So , that 's the <unk> .
My <unk> is that in the middle , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , and <unk> for the <unk> <unk> .
If you don 't have seen it in the store under the store , you 're very soon that 's <unk> .
And what 's the <unk> is that people <unk> in <unk> and make this question . And you know , what is the answer ? The answer is , " No . "
It 's not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn 't make things .
So , in other <unk> of life that are much more important than <unk> , <unk> the same <unk> of choices .
<unk> : <unk> , not going on on the United States that you 're going to <unk> and the <unk> you have to do .
Instead , you know , <unk> from <unk> , and the <unk> says , " OK , we could do it . <unk> , or <unk> " <unk> " <unk> " <unk> " <unk> " <unk> " these <unk> , " <unk> , " What do you want to do ? "
You say , " <unk> , what do you do ? "
And the <unk> says , " <unk> , " <unk> , " <unk> , " and <unk> <unk> these <unk> . "
" What do you want to do ? "
And you say , " <unk> if you were me , what would you say ? "
And the <unk> , " But I 'm not her . "
The result we call it " <unk> <unk> <unk> , " <unk> <unk> , " <unk> <unk> , " <unk> <unk> , " <unk> <unk> .
But it 's not that one <unk> the weight and the responsibility of <unk> decisions from somebody who knows something , <unk> the <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , and not in <unk> <unk> to make decisions .
There 's a huge <unk> of <unk> products , <unk> to people like me and you , if you think about it doesn 't make any sense , because you can 't <unk> .
But if we can 't we <unk> , why do we <unk> them ?
The answer is they want to <unk> , we call the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And we 're going to be <unk> as a fundamental <unk> , is a question of choice , as you see in this <unk> " <unk> . We don 't want to <unk> kids . <unk> their sex at the right time . " We don 't want to <unk> it .
And we can <unk> how many times we <unk> .
And that means that every <unk> , to <unk> , you have to decide that kind of person you want to be .
<unk> to the family and at <unk> , a time time , the common perspective , was that you <unk> the <unk> as soon as possible , and they could <unk> to <unk> kids to <unk> the <unk> as soon as possible .
The only real choice was with who , not when , and they 're not even what to do after .
<unk> , all of that 's really to play .
They 're going to be smart students , and they 're going to do 20 percent of work on a time .
And because they 're not <unk> , because they 're not <unk> .
But why are <unk> , <unk> to <unk> , " <unk> <unk> <unk> or not ? "
" <unk> <unk> <unk> later later ? I have to think about kids or career ? "
They 're <unk> <unk> .
And they try to answer these questions , even if this <unk> didn 't <unk> the <unk> that <unk> and not a big <unk> to my <unk> .
And they have to do it . They 're important questions .
Now , the work : we 're <unk> , as <unk> <unk> , because the technology allows us to work every minute , every day , every corner of the planet , <unk> that from the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , there 's a <unk> , and I 'm not going to tell you where the <unk> works .
I 'm not going to tell you , because I want to use it .
What does , this incredible freedom to choice that we have about work ? It 's what we have to <unk> , <unk> at any time , if we have to work or no .
We can go to see our son to play <unk> , with the phone in a <unk> , the <unk> in the other , and the <unk> , <unk> .
And even if I 'm all <unk> , every minute we see our son , we 're also going to be <unk> , " I have to answer this called ? "
" I have to answer this <unk> ? I have to <unk> this letter ? "
And even when the answer is , " no , " that makes the experience of your son very different <unk> from what it would be in other conditions .
So , from any part of all of them , we look at small and <unk> , and life is a question of choices .
And once the world was this : <unk> , there were some possibility , but it wasn 't a question of choice .
The world 's <unk> to <unk> this : <unk> is , " Is it a <unk> thing , or <unk> ? "
The answer is <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> we know all , so I 'm going to talk about the <unk> .
And we 're going to <unk> two effects of people .
The first , <unk> , is that it <unk> instead of <unk> .
With a lot of <unk> between which is very hard to do it .
I 'm going to give you a <unk> <unk> : a <unk> study on the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
A <unk> <unk> has had access to the <unk> data , the <unk> society , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , with about a million <unk> <unk> in different <unk> .
What she discovered is that for every 10 solutions that are <unk> in the <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> two percent .
With 50 <unk> <unk> , there 's 10 percent in less than when they 're available . Why ?
Because with 50 <unk> <unk> that <unk> , is <unk> hard to decide , and choice is <unk> to <unk> .
And at <unk> , and again , <unk> , <unk> , and of course , <unk> , and of course , it 's never <unk> .
<unk> that doesn 't mean that these <unk> <unk> <unk> food to <unk> because they 're not going to have enough money , they want to say that the decision is so <unk> that we 're also <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
They 're not <unk> , they 're <unk> to <unk> for a year from the <unk> of work , which would be <unk> to <unk> .
So the <unk> is a <unk> of having <unk> choices .
And I think that 's going to <unk> the world .
" And I end , to the <unk> : <unk> , <unk> or <unk> ? "
You have to take the right decision , if it 's <unk> , right ?
You don 't want to choose the bottom , and you 're going to <unk> the wrong .
So this is the first effect . The second is that we also have if we can <unk> <unk> and make a choice , at the end of how to <unk> the <unk> and make a choice , to be <unk> with less <unk> between which to choose .
And that 's a lot of reasons .
One of these is that with many <unk> between which to choose , if you 're going to <unk> one and it 's not perfect , it 's easy to imagine that it would be better . And what happens is that the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> by <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> ,
And when it was a <unk> decision .
The more choices there are , it 's easier to <unk> any <unk> that is <unk> of <unk> choice .
And it also 's what <unk> call .
Dan <unk> <unk> <unk> very well as well as the value that we give things to <unk> from what we <unk> .
<unk> , when there are a lot of possible , it 's easy to <unk> the <unk> of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> that <unk> is choice .
Here 's a example . I 'm going to <unk> with all the ones that are not in New York .
But that 's what we probably <unk> .
There 's this <unk> to <unk> .
A place of <unk> .
<unk> <unk> . I 'm going to be all for them .
It 's not going to be . But what he thinks is , " Well , <unk> , it 's <unk> . "
" All my <unk> to <unk> are on . "
" <unk> <unk> <unk> right at home . "
And it <unk> two weeks from the idea that 's <unk> -- every day -- the possibility of <unk> where you want .
The <unk> <unk> for what we have , even when choice was <unk> .
And the <unk> we have from <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> us against how to <unk> .
Here 's another example .
This <unk> tells us a lot of things .
And it 's about living the moment , and maybe in the <unk> .
But the most important thing is that anything you 're going to <unk> , you 're not doing other .
The things that don 't have a lot of <unk> that can make less <unk> what we do .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> <unk> .
I tried it on my skin <unk> a couple of <unk> .
They 're going to be <unk> .
And once the <unk> were <unk> of one like , <unk> them and <unk> , they were <unk> , just after <unk> a life and <unk> a lot of times , they were going to go to well .
So , I went to <unk> a couple of them , when the <unk> were gone , and I said , " I 'm going to do a couple of <unk> , this is my <unk> . "
And <unk> said , " <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> ? "
<unk> or <unk> ? "
" <unk> <unk> <unk> ? "
" <unk> <unk> them want to <unk> or <unk> ? <unk> <unk> <unk> -- " <unk> <unk> . "
I was <unk> , and after a little bit I was able to say , " I want the guy -- that was the only guy -- that was that was , so for a time . I 'm going to <unk> all the <unk> <unk> , and then <unk> by the store , I had ever had .
It was the <unk> . With all that choice I had to <unk> the best .
But I 'm going to be worse .
Why ? I wrote a whole book for <unk> .
The reason I was worse is that with all the choice was <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
I had <unk> <unk> . I didn 't know anything I was going to <unk> when I only had a kind of <unk> , but when we 're 100 different , at least a kind of be perfect .
What I had to be good , but not perfect .
After I was <unk> to what I was <unk> in <unk> to <unk> .
The <unk> of <unk> in life of people don 't do <unk> the <unk> that these have <unk> than the <unk> .
And this <unk> less <unk> , even when the results are good .
<unk> in the world of the <unk> world .
Because if you 're going to <unk> , I 'm not talking about .
The truth truth is more than that .
" And it was better when you was worse , " The reason why was was was better when you know , it was even even even even <unk> of the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> , in the world that we live -- <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , the <unk> that we can <unk> is that the things are <unk> to <unk> .
You never have to <unk> <unk> because your <unk> , my <unk> , are <unk> .
The <unk> of happiness -- what you 're here -- is , " <unk> <unk> " Yes , you want to be . "
I mean , a little bit <unk> -- that I 'm really <unk> and my wife is really <unk> .
I couldn 't have better , I didn 't have <unk> .
But <unk> , it 's not a <unk> thing .
And I mean , a <unk> of <unk> <unk> when there 's only the kind of <unk> <unk> is that when you 're not <unk> , and you say , " Why ? "
" Who is <unk> ? " I 'm <unk> . "
The world is the <unk> . What can I do ?
When there are hundreds of types of <unk> , and you 're going to <unk> a <unk> , and you 're going to <unk> you who is the <unk> , you 're <unk> that the <unk> you are .
I could do better .
With hundreds of <unk> available , there are not <unk> for <unk> .
So when people make decisions , even though the result is <unk> , they <unk> and give their own .
In the last last few years , the <unk> is <unk> in the <unk> world .
I think a <unk> <unk> -- not the only thing , but important -- of this <unk> <unk> is that people have experiences because the <unk> are too <unk> .
And when they have to <unk> this situation think that <unk> is their own .
So the final result is that in general we 're better , <unk> , but we 're going to be worse .
I 'm going to show you .
This is the <unk> <unk> , what we all take for good and it is completely <unk> . It 's not true .
There 's no <unk> that a little bit better than <unk> is not <unk> at all , but from this doesn 't <unk> that much choice is better than a little bit .
There 's a <unk> , <unk> . I don 't know what it is .
But I 'm enough we 've been <unk> by a piece of the level where the choices <unk> our life .
Now , from the <unk> <unk> -- I 'm almost finished -- I 'm going to -- from the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> is the <unk> .
What allows all this choice in <unk> society is the <unk> material .
There are many places in the world , and you have <unk> <unk> , where the problem is not that they have <unk> .
The problem is that they have too <unk> .
So the <unk> I 'm talking about is a <unk> <unk> of <unk> , <unk> society .
And what <unk> does <unk> and <unk> is this : <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> for <unk> <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . It 's a money .
I mean , <unk> and <unk> , not that they 're just <unk> .
They 're <unk> <unk> .
They do worse .
If a little bit of what in our society allows choice to be <unk> in those where people have too few people , not only it would be their life to be <unk> , but we have our .
This is what <unk> call a <unk> <unk> .
A <unk> of income income is good for everyone -- not only the poor -- because of this choice in <unk> that <unk> us .
And I said , " You can become everything you want to be --
<unk> , people , <unk> , " What do you know that fish ? "
" It 's <unk> that you can 't do anything in a glass <unk> . "
" A <unk> imagination , a <unk> view of the world -- " --
and I <unk> it , at the beginning .
But then , I 'm going to say , what fish does the long thing .
Because the reality is that if you <unk> the <unk> , in the way that , " everything is possible to be " <unk> . " You can 't <unk> the freedom . They <unk> the <unk> .
If you <unk> the <unk> <unk> so that everything you could <unk> the <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , and <unk> the <unk> .
All of them need a <unk> .
This is almost certainly too <unk> , maybe even for the fish , and certainly for us .
But the <unk> of some <unk> <unk> is a <unk> for <unk> and , <unk> , for <unk> .
Thank you very much .
