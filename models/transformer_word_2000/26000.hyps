<unk> year I showed these <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> , which for almost three million years has been the size of the United States <unk> , has <unk> of the United States , has <unk> <unk> .
I love this <unk> the <unk> of the problem because it doesn 't show the <unk> of ice .
<unk> <unk> is , in a sense , the heart <unk> of the global climate system .
They <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
The next <unk> is going to be a <unk> <unk> on the <unk> of the last 25 years .
<unk> <unk> are <unk> in red .
You see , you <unk> up to the blue <unk> .
That 's the ice in <unk> , which <unk> summer .
You can see that the <unk> <unk> ice , of five years or more , is like blood , which here is <unk> from the body .
It 's been <unk> for 25 years .
This is a problem because the <unk> <unk> is <unk> the <unk> <unk> around the ocean where there are huge <unk> of <unk> that , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , are <unk> in <unk> from <unk> .
<unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> of <unk> , that <unk> <unk> .
In some <unk> <unk> , you 're going to <unk> the <unk> of the water .
The <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> last <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> ! <unk> : You 're doing it . <unk> : You 're doing it .
A reason is that this <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
This is a <unk> river in <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> had never <unk> <unk> .
This is the <unk> river , in the <unk> of <unk> .
If you want to know how the sea level to <unk> <unk> to the sea level for the <unk> <unk> , here 's where the sea level .
These <unk> are <unk> <unk> .
On the other side of the planet : <unk> , the largest <unk> of ice on the planet .
<unk> month , the <unk> <unk> of ice is in <unk> , and that <unk> <unk> , which <unk> on some <unk> <unk> , is particularly <unk> in <unk> .
<unk> at six feet of the <unk> of <unk> , like in <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , the third largest <unk> of ice , you see new <unk> , which few years ago were <unk> .
<unk> 40 percent of the world 's population <unk> water from that <unk> .
<unk> <unk> : this <unk> is the source of <unk> water .
The <unk> is <unk> .
But when you <unk> , the same happens to the water <unk> .
In California , <unk> <unk> <unk> is 40 percent <unk> .
<unk> <unk> are in crisis .
<unk> , as you read , they 're <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> in the world <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> are <unk> to a <unk> out of the normal and <unk> .
<unk> times more <unk> in the last 30 years than <unk> <unk> .
This is a <unk> of all <unk> .
If you look at the <unk> context of them if you can see the <unk> .
In the last five years we 've <unk> 70 million <unk> of CO2 every 24 hours of <unk> in the oceans .
Look at <unk> the area of the <unk> <unk> , from <unk> , and on both of the <unk> <unk> <unk> , and on both parts of the <unk> <unk> , where there 's a oxygen <unk> in the ocean .
The largest cause of global warming , together to <unk> , which is 20 percent , is the use of <unk> <unk> .
The oil is a problem , and <unk> is even worse .
The United States is one of the two countries with most emissions , together with China .
And you 're trying to build a lot of other <unk> .
But we 're <unk> to a <unk> of direction .
These are the <unk> projects over the last few years and some of the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> , there is a political <unk> in our country .
The <unk> of <unk> and oil have <unk> <unk> million dollars in the last year to <unk> <unk> , which is a <unk> .
I 'm going to give me something --
<unk> <unk> , in <unk> , where I live , there was a <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
You might have seen it on <unk> .
This is the second largest flow in America .
It 's happened around <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> of one of <unk> <unk> was this .
<unk> : <unk> ♫ ♫ <unk> <unk> is a <unk> and happy .
It 's <unk> here in America , and it makes our economy .
<unk> <unk> is <unk> .
It 's good price , <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> here is a lot of <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The largest <unk> society on the <unk> is <unk> <unk> . This is her <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> . <unk> : <unk> <unk> -- Al <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> -- they don 't know what they 're talking about .
<unk> : So <unk> for <unk> <unk> <unk> has two <unk> .
This is one of them , one part .
<unk> : <unk> : <unk> <unk> , we see <unk> changes as a <unk> <unk> to our business .
And so that we have a great amount of money in a <unk> <unk> to make public and <unk> the truth on <unk> .
In fact , <unk> is not <unk> .
We think it 's also <unk> -- also good <unk> .
So we don 't <unk> of climate change .
We want to do it .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> -- you 've heard about it very much .
So , I <unk> a <unk> in a structure of <unk> is about <unk> .
<unk> ! The cars are a little <unk> , but that 's the sound of the <unk> technology .
<unk> <unk> is between the major <unk> of global <unk> , but the <unk> <unk> technology that you see change everything .
Let 's look at : this is the <unk> <unk> technology .
<unk> : <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> to the economic question and the national security .
<unk> : <unk> is in crisis ; America is in crisis ; the national security crisis .
The <unk> that <unk> all : our <unk> from the <unk> <unk> , like <unk> and oil <unk> .
Now , there 's a new , <unk> <unk> solution to <unk> .
<unk> America : 100 percent <unk> energy , in 10 years .
A plan for <unk> America at work , more <unk> , and help help <unk> global warming .
<unk> , a solution that we 're going to solve our problems .
<unk> America . <unk> more .
<unk> : This is the last one .
<unk> : <unk> : That 's about <unk> energy to America .
One of the most <unk> ways to <unk> <unk> from <unk> <unk> that <unk> our planet .
<unk> : The future is here . <unk> , <unk> , <unk> new network <unk> .
<unk> <unk> 2 : <unk> <unk> for jobs <unk> <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> America . It 's time to be <unk> .
<unk> : A old <unk> <unk> says , " If you want to go to <unk> , you go to alone .
If you want to go away , you go to , you go together . "
We need to go far , quickly .
Thank you very much .
<unk> year at TED I <unk> a <unk> on <unk> .
And I try to <unk> about how the car works .
So , I 'm <unk> . And for those who was no other time , the <unk> is the largest scientific experiment ever <unk> -- <unk> miles an hour of <unk> .
His task is to <unk> the conditions that were <unk> in the universe -- until <unk> million times a second from the beginning of the universe -- until <unk> million times a second .
All of that is just <unk> .
This is the car <unk> .
They <unk> these <unk> <unk> into the <unk> .
This is what I work . It 's called <unk> -- it 's <unk> <unk> feet and has a <unk> <unk> .
This is a <unk> image of <unk> in building so you can see <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> last year we <unk> the car for the first time .
And this picture was <unk> by <unk> .
It was <unk> <unk> in control room .
It 's a picture of the first <unk> of particles that had made all of the <unk> , <unk> in <unk> , with a part of the <unk> , and <unk> <unk> inside the <unk> .
In other words , when you look at the <unk> 10 <unk> , you know that the car <unk> , which is a great <unk> .
I don 't know if it was to <unk> us more or that , when someone <unk> on Google and <unk> that the page <unk> was this .
That means we 've had an impact <unk> <unk> beyond that scientific .
<unk> a week later , there was a problem with the car , <unk> , you know , these <unk> <unk> here -- these <unk> <unk> .
These <unk> <unk> <unk> when the car car works at the <unk> of the <unk> .
Now , the <unk> between you <unk> and <unk> , " It 's not true . It 's not true . It 's too <unk> . "
And instead they can do it because when they 're very <unk> to get <unk> <unk> <unk> .
So , unless you 're in <unk> degrees , at a temperature <unk> to the space between stars , these <unk> can bring that <unk> .
In one of the <unk> of the most of the <unk> <unk> in the <unk> , there was a <unk> <unk> .
So the <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
This was the result .
Now , this is even more <unk> if you think that these <unk> <unk> over 20 <unk> , and that <unk> of about 30 <unk> .
They 're about 50 <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , what we did .
We <unk> them and <unk> .
Now they 're all <unk> to their <unk> .
We 're going to <unk> the <unk> <unk> again .
We <unk> it , and we <unk> to get data to <unk> or <unk> , and so on our <unk> to find out what the <unk> are the universe .
Now , of course , in some way , these <unk> <unk> the <unk> of science and engineering engineering . It 's easy to <unk> .
I think that 's so hard , the fact that , the fact that that it 's value of things like <unk> .
I 'd like to <unk> with the words of a <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , who , in <unk> <unk> of <unk> experiments of human mind , his <unk> was <unk> , his <unk> was Michael <unk> said , " It 's not so <unk> for the progress of the human mind as the <unk> that the ideas of science are <unk> , that there are no new <unk> by not going to be <unk> , and that there are no new <unk> <unk> . "
Thank you .
I want to start with <unk> to <unk> to when when children , as <unk> , as children , <unk> .
<unk> , I was <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> problems .
The <unk> <unk> is <unk> to the way that we <unk> a lot of the world around us .
So , from <unk> <unk> from the <unk> of our <unk> with <unk> objects , together my <unk> <unk> , and my <unk> <unk> <unk> , I started <unk> : " And if you use a computer , instead of having just a computer , instead of having the only <unk> of the <unk> as a <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> information with both hands , and I just got information with both hands ,
and <unk> to our <unk> ?
The question was so interesting that we wanted to explore the answer , building <unk> .
In a few words , a <unk> is a computer <unk> as a <unk> .
In a few words , a <unk> is a computer <unk> as a <unk> .
You can <unk> them with your hand , they can <unk> themselves , to hear their movement and have a screen and a <unk> radio .
But <unk> , they 're <unk> objects , like <unk> , you can just <unk> <unk> .
<unk> are a new example of tools for <unk> information .
And as they become more <unk> , <unk> of the movement , other , and as they become more <unk> , <unk> of their movement , other , <unk> of how they <unk> them , we can explore new <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
Let 's start with some simple example .
This <unk> is <unk> to show : if you <unk> it in a direction , the video will be <unk> like that , if you look at the other side , you know , if you look at it in a direction , the video <unk> .
These <unk> <unk> are <unk> of others .
If you <unk> them , you 're <unk> to what they 're going to .
If they 're <unk> , you can <unk> it and they can <unk> a little bit .
If they 're <unk> , you can <unk> it and they can <unk> a little bit .
They also <unk> their movement and <unk> .
We 've then <unk> that one of the interesting <unk> of the <unk> was to be able to use <unk> in data , for example , <unk> , which is a color as a <unk> .
In this case , we have three <unk> <unk> like <unk> <unk> and I can <unk> for <unk> <unk> , I can <unk> for <unk> of color in the central where you 're <unk> .
And I can <unk> for <unk> of color in central , where you 're <unk> .
If you get too much , we can <unk> a little bit of a place .
I also have <unk> possibilities of <unk> , like <unk> , and <unk> where people can try things things , and <unk> the <unk> that people can try things things , and they immediately <unk> .
Now I 'm --
This is a <unk> sequence I do with a <unk> program .
Here we have a words of words that are half between <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> , at every <unk> , I <unk> a letter in every <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , every <unk> , <unk> a letter , on every <unk> , and while I was <unk> in the <unk> , he was going to <unk> on a <unk> .
Then , after about 30 seconds , you <unk> , and you have a new <unk> of <unk> and new <unk> to try .
Thank you .
Here 's children <unk> in <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> , I made it in a way that I <unk> them and I 've <unk> a video .
They 're very <unk> .
And one of the interesting things of <unk> is that you don 't have to give people a lot of <unk> .
I just said , " <unk> of words , " and they know what to do .
Here 's other people who <unk> it .
This is our <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , there 's the <unk> .
It actually wanted to <unk> .
They were just <unk> , for him .
Now , this is a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
We wanted to build a tool for the <unk> of <unk> . He 's <unk> .
It can <unk> new characters in the scene , <unk> <unk> their <unk> .
It can <unk> new characters in the scene , <unk> <unk> their <unk> .
So , here 's making the sun .
<unk> : The sun is <unk> .
David <unk> : Now he 's got a <unk> in the scene .
<unk> : The <unk> <unk> .
<unk> work ! Yeah !
So , <unk> <unk> and <unk> can <unk> the characters and <unk> can <unk> the characters --
<unk> : <unk> .
-- I <unk> their story .
<unk> : <unk> .
<unk> : It 's a story with final , and it can decide how to <unk> .
<unk> : It 's a story with final , and it can decide how to <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> , <unk> .
<unk> : The last example I have time I 'm going to show you is a <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> music .
It 's a recently that 's recently , for <unk> and <unk> music .
The <unk> here are <unk> as a <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> of these has four different <unk> , and you can choose which you use .
You can also <unk> these <unk> in a sequence from <unk> to <unk> .
And you just <unk> a sound and a sequence .
These are effects effects that you can control from alive , like <unk> and <unk> .
I 'm going to <unk> the particular sound and then <unk> to <unk> .
And then there are the effects of time and <unk> , which <unk> to the entire sequence .
It 's how it works .
<unk> : <unk> a <unk> on two <unk> , " sequence in two <unk> , " sequence in a series , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> ,
Now I 'm going to take a little <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> : Now I <unk> <unk> --
<unk> : <unk> : And now I 'm going to <unk> the <unk> to <unk> , so I can control the effect of the live .
<unk> : <unk> : I can <unk> the entire sequence time from one side or the other .
<unk> : <unk> : And now we <unk> the <unk> to give more <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> : I can <unk> the sequence of the flight .
So I don 't have to <unk> before , but I can <unk> it , <unk> more <unk> or more <unk> .
And now , finally , I can <unk> the entire <unk> sequence on the left <unk> <unk> .
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is to build new <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to how our brain work and body .
And today , I 've had time to show you one of the results of this path , and some possibilities that we 're trying to get out of the lab .
The concept that I want to <unk> is that it 's <unk> this new generation of objects for <unk> with the media , which <unk> information in our world in our world in the way we want .
Thank you very much .
I don 't see the time of talking to all of you .
I 'm a <unk> .
<unk> books is my <unk> , but it 's more than that , obviously .
It 's also love and love <unk> of my life .
And I don 't expect that to change .
But , I said , something particular happened in my life and in my career , which <unk> me to <unk> the whole <unk> of this work .
The particular thing is I 've <unk> wrote this book , this <unk> called " <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , " which , <unk> my <unk> , for some reason to <unk> in the world and <unk> a big , <unk> <unk> .
And the result is that everywhere I 'm going to <unk> now , people <unk> me as if I was <unk> .
<unk> -- <unk> , <unk> .
I 'm going to <unk> , I 'm going to <unk> and say , " You don 't fear of you not be able to do it better ?
You don 't fear you 're not afraid to write all of life , without being able to create a book that could <unk> to someone ? "
you can <unk> to someone ? "
It 's <unk> , you know .
But it could be worse , except for me that more than 20 years ago , when I was saying to people -- I was a <unk> -- I wanted to be a <unk> .
I 'm going to be <unk> from fear .
And people say , " Don 't you feel you don 't have successful ?
You don 't fear that <unk> <unk> <unk> ?
You don 't fear to do this <unk> all of life without anything that you ever ever get out and die on a <unk> of <unk> with the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> ?
You know , you know .
The answer -- the short answer to all these questions is , " Yeah . "
Yeah , I 'm afraid of all of those things .
I always was afraid .
And I 'm afraid of many other things that people couldn 't <unk> .
How <unk> and other things <unk> .
But , as much as it is to write what I thought and <unk> is why ?
Is it <unk> ?
It 's <unk> that anyone who <unk> <unk> to be <unk> by a job that you feel like you 're born to do .
But what is that <unk> in the <unk> <unk> <unk> by <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> in a way that other <unk> , <unk> <unk> , in a way that other <unk> don 't do ?
My father , for example , he was a <unk> <unk> and not <unk> of one time in his 40 years of activity where he was asked if she was afraid to be <unk> <unk> ?
It never -- that <unk> of the <unk> John , how does it go ?
<unk> 't you like that , <unk> ?
<unk> , engineers like <unk> <unk> , they don 't certainly , in <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
We <unk> , we have enough this <unk> , and not only <unk> but <unk> all kinds of <unk> , we have this <unk> that we have this <unk> that we have <unk> to be <unk> <unk> .
And he was not <unk> to look at the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> that , only in the <unk> century , <unk> young , often for them .
And the ones that don 't <unk> seem to be really <unk> by their <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , before you die in the last <unk> said , " Every my book has <unk> me a little <unk> about the work of your life .
But we don 't <unk> <unk> when we say that because we 've heard these things so long that in a way we 've got completely <unk> and <unk> the <unk> that creativity and <unk> are in some way , and that the art , finally , <unk> .
And the question I want to ask you to all this is : you agree with this idea ?
It 's OK , you know , because it 's also <unk> by a <unk> <unk> to me .
I think it 's <unk> .
And I think it 's also <unk> , and I don 't want to <unk> <unk> in the next century .
I think it 's better to <unk> our great <unk> to live .
And I certainly know that , in my case -- it would be very <unk> to begin to <unk> to that <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> in which I 'm in my career .
<unk> -- <unk> , look , they 're quite young , I have about 40 years .
I still have about four <unk> of work in me .
And it 's very <unk> that everything will happen in the world , which is going to be <unk> from the world like the work that after the <unk> of my last book .
<unk> <unk> , because we are all the more or less friends here -- is <unk> that my biggest success is to my <unk> .
Oh , <unk> , thinking .
You know , this is the kind of <unk> that is a person to begin to <unk> <unk> at nine in the morning and I don 't want to do it .
I 'm going to continue to do this work that I love .
So , the question becomes , how ?
And so I think , after many <unk> , that way , I work to continue to write is to create a <unk> <unk> <unk> , OK ?
I have to get some way of security distance between me , which I 'm <unk> , and my <unk> <unk> on what <unk> <unk> . And as I 'm going to go to all last year we 're going to try to find other societies to see if you have better ideas to see if you have better ideas and look at the <unk> of the best ideas and find other society to see if you have better , and I 'm <unk> to see if you have better ideas .
about how to help people <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of creativity .
And that research led me to <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
<unk> because I was <unk> and then <unk> back .
<unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> -- people don 't believe that creativity <unk> from men , OK ?
It was <unk> that creativity was this <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> to men from some <unk> <unk> and <unk> , for reasons and <unk> .
<unk> <unk> these <unk> <unk> of creativity <unk> .
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> to have a <unk> that <unk> <unk> from a <unk> .
The <unk> were the same idea , but they <unk> the species of spirit without a <unk> .
which is <unk> , because <unk> didn 't really <unk> to be somebody was particularly smart .
I thought that a <unk> was this sort of <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> literally in the <unk> <unk> of a <unk> artist , a little bit like <unk> <unk> , and that I <unk> out of <unk> <unk> the work of the artist artist and <unk> the <unk> of that work .
<unk> <unk> , that 's the distance of which I 'm talking -- that <unk> you 're going to be <unk> by the results of your work .
And everyone thought it was like , right ?
So the <unk> artists were <unk> by <unk> things , like <unk> too <unk> , right ?
If your work was <unk> , you didn 't <unk> it all the <unk> , you would all <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> by this <unk> <unk> .
If your work <unk> , it wasn 't all your <unk> , you ?
Everybody <unk> that was your <unk> to be a <unk> .
And so people are <unk> <unk> creativity for a long time .
Then the <unk> <unk> and everything <unk> , and we <unk> this great idea ; we <unk> the human being at the center of the universe and the center and the <unk> and without more space to <unk> that <unk> from <unk> .
This was the <unk> of <unk> <unk> and people started to think that creativity <unk> completely <unk> .
And for the first time in history , you start <unk> to <unk> this , or that artist as a <unk> rather than a person with <unk> .
And I have to <unk> , I think it was a big <unk> .
I think you know somebody , a simple person to believe that I 'm like a <unk> like the source , <unk> and the <unk> of all the <unk> <unk> , <unk> and <unk> and <unk> is a <unk> responsibility to <unk> to human <unk> .
It 's like <unk> to someone to <unk> the sun .
<unk> and <unk> completely the <unk> and creates all these <unk> <unk> <unk> on the <unk> .
And I think it was this pressure that <unk> artists in the <unk> 500 years .
And if that 's true , and I think that 's that 's the question becomes , and right now ?
Can we do that ?
I want to go back to a <unk> understanding of the relationship between humans and <unk> <unk> .
Or maybe not .
Maybe we can 't <unk> 500 years of thinking in an <unk> talk .
And there 's probably people in the audience who <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> on the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> people <unk> <unk> on their projects .
You probably don 't <unk> all about this thing .
But the question I want to ask you is -- why don 't you ?
Why don 't you <unk> this way ?
Because it makes more sense of all other thing I 've ever heard about the <unk> <unk> of <unk> .
A process of process that , as anyone who ever <unk> to do something -- so basically , everybody -- you know , you don 't <unk> <unk> .
And in fact , it can sometimes be completely <unk> .
I 've been <unk> this <unk> with the amazing <unk> <unk> , who has now now 90 years , but that was a <unk> for all of life and said that during his <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> out in the <unk> <unk> , <unk> out in the fields , and I <unk> it , inside the <unk> from <unk> .
She said it was like a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And she <unk> <unk> to her from <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> , because he was <unk> the land under its feet .
I was <unk> to have one thing to do at that point and was , words , " <unk> like a <unk> . "
And he <unk> to the house and was <unk> by this <unk> , and it should not have to do anything that you have a piece of paper and a <unk> enough <unk> in the way , <unk> and <unk> and <unk> on the page .
<unk> times you didn 't want to be <unk> <unk> , so <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> without being able to get home and <unk> the <unk> through and she would <unk> through and she would <unk> through the <unk> , and she would <unk> through the <unk> , and she would <unk> through the <unk> , and she would <unk> through the <unk> , and she would <unk> <unk> through the <unk> , and she
Then there were times -- this piece , I never knew it -- there were times when the <unk> was almost <unk> , right ?
So , he was <unk> at home and she was looking for for the paper and <unk> the <unk> through , and he <unk> a <unk> just in the while he was <unk> , and then he was like , and then he was <unk> , which was like the other hand and <unk> .
I <unk> the tail and <unk> her body and <unk> it into his body and the <unk> on the page .
And in these cases , the <unk> <unk> <unk> page <unk> and <unk> but <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> to the <unk> <unk> to the first <unk> .
So when you <unk> -- it 's <unk> , it 's <unk> to my <unk> process .
Not my <unk> process -- I 'm not a <unk> .
I 'm a <unk> , and my way of <unk> is ; I 'm going to <unk> every day and work and work and <unk> it .
But even I , in my <unk> , I <unk> against that thing , sometimes .
And I knew that many of you <unk> it .
You know , even though the work and ideas , I <unk> <unk> from a source , I couldn 't <unk> <unk> .
And what is this thing ?
And how can we <unk> it in a way we don 't have to <unk> your head ?
And I 'm just as much as I 'm , <unk> <unk> that I have been <unk> <unk> <unk> , which I 've been <unk> different years ago for a <unk> .
And I was talking about this , and you know , <unk> , for the <unk> of life was the <unk> of the <unk> artist <unk> , trying to control , <unk> , <unk> these <unk> <unk> <unk> completely <unk> .
But then <unk> , he was <unk> on a day as he was <unk> on a <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> all for him .
I was going quickly , and all of a <unk> <unk> this little <unk> of <unk> , which comes in his head as the <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , and the <unk> , you know , it 's wonderful , and the <unk> , but he doesn 't know how to <unk> .
It 's not a piece of paper , it doesn 't have a <unk> .
So he starts to feel this <unk> species of old <unk> to grow in him , and I 'm going to lose , and <unk> <unk> from this song .
I 'm not enough , I can 't <unk> . "
And instead of going to <unk> , they <unk> .
<unk> the entire process and made something completely new .
You just <unk> the sky and said , " <unk> , don 't you see that I 'm <unk> ? "
" It seems to <unk> you can write a song now ? "
If you really want to <unk> , you 're going to get a <unk> moment when I can take care of you .
<unk> , I started to <unk> another today .
I started to <unk> <unk> <unk> . "
And his <unk> process after that .
Not the work , the work was still <unk> as always .
But the process , and the <unk> <unk> that <unk> was <unk> when he was <unk> when he <unk> , the <unk> that <unk> out of him , he was <unk> that he was not supposed to be a <unk> and <unk> .
but I was <unk> this , <unk> <unk> , and this <unk> <unk> a conversation between <unk> and this <unk> , but it wasn 't <unk> .
So , how much the story <unk> to change a little bit , even the way I 'm going to <unk> and already <unk> me once .
This idea , I was when I was <unk> , " <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , " and I <unk> in one of the <unk> in which we 're all working on something , and you don 't know you start thinking that a <unk> , that will be the <unk> book .
Not just <unk> , the <unk> book .
And I started thinking about <unk> this project .
But then I <unk> to <unk> that <unk> air and <unk> us .
So I <unk> my face in the <unk> and I <unk> my <unk> to a <unk> <unk> in the room .
And I said to <unk> , " <unk> , what , both , you know that if this book is not going to be <unk> , right ?
Because as you see , I 'm <unk> everything I have , I don 't have more than that .
So if you want it better , you have to <unk> and make your <unk> .
Okay . But if you don 't do it , you know what , I don 't <unk> .
I started to write the same because it 's my work .
And I 'd like to <unk> that it was <unk> that I 've been <unk> to do my part . " Because it 's so , OK -- <unk> does it in the <unk> of North Africa , people <unk> to <unk> to be <unk> at the <unk> of the moon , <unk> music that I would <unk> forward for hours to <unk> .
And they were always <unk> , because the <unk> were <unk> and they were <unk> .
But every once once once , I <unk> , something <unk> , and one of these <unk> artists actually <unk> actually .
And I know you know what I 'm talking about , because I know you 've all seen , at some point , one <unk> like this .
It was like the time , and the <unk> <unk> through a kind of <unk> and he wasn 't doing anything that <unk> from the <unk> , like the <unk> <unk> before , but everything was <unk> .
And suddenly you don 't just <unk> as a human .
But they <unk> from <unk> and <unk> in the fire of the <unk> .
And when this <unk> , at the time , people were <unk> what was , he <unk> with her name .
<unk> your hands and <unk> to <unk> , " <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , God , God , " God . "
That 's God , you know .
<unk> <unk> -- when the <unk> <unk> <unk> , they <unk> this <unk> with them and <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , " to " <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , " which you can still feel in <unk> or in <unk> .
In <unk> , when an artist has done something impossible and <unk> , " <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , " <unk> , <unk> . " <unk> of God .
And it 's <unk> because we need to do .
But , the problem comes after day , for the <unk> itself , when you <unk> and <unk> that are 11 <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> . And the <unk> of God is no more .
It 's just a <unk> <unk> to <unk> , and perhaps you never <unk> to <unk> that <unk> .
And maybe nobody <unk> the name of God still <unk> , and what 's got to do with the rest of his life ?
It 's hard .
This is one of the most <unk> <unk> to make in a <unk> life .
But maybe it 's not to be so <unk> if you <unk> to not believe , <unk> , that the most <unk> of your being come from you .
But you just <unk> you get data in <unk> from a <unk> source of this <unk> part of your life that you have to go to <unk> .
And , you know , if we think it all .
And so I started <unk> , and it 's certainly how I <unk> it for several months during the <unk> of the book that I was <unk> , the <unk> , <unk> of my <unk> .
And what I have to continue <unk> when I feel <unk> from this is , I don 't fear .
You don 't <unk> . You just <unk> your work .
You 're going to <unk> for your side , whatever it is .
If your work is <unk> , it 's <unk> .
If the <unk> , you 're going to <unk> you would have some kind of <unk> , for one moment through your <unk> , " <unk> ! "
<unk> , you make the same your <unk> .
And " <unk> ! " <unk> to you .
I think that 's <unk> and I think it <unk> .
" <unk> ! " <unk> ! " <unk> to you , even for having had love human <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Thank you .
Thank you .
<unk> <unk> : <unk> !
You know , I 've already talked about some of these projects on the human genome , what it can <unk> and the discovery of new genes .
We 're going to <unk> a new path : we started <unk> biology and now starting from that digital code , in a new <unk> of biology , <unk> and <unk> life .
We 've always been trying to ask for big questions .
" What 's the life ? " That 's something that many <unk> , I think have <unk> to do various levels .
We have different <unk> , we <unk> to <unk> terms .
We 're <unk> for almost 20 years now .
When we <unk> the human genome <unk> to go from the <unk> world of biology in the digital world .
Now we 're <unk> to us : Can the life <unk> , or create new life from this digital universe ?
This is a map of a small <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> , which is the species from the <unk> genome that 's the <unk> between those that can <unk> in the lab .
And we tried to reduce the genome to <unk> a even smaller .
We can <unk> a <unk> of <unk> about 500 genes that are here .
But when you look at his <unk> map , it 's <unk> simple than our .
<unk> , that 's simple .
But when we look at all the <unk> that we can <unk> , one at the time , is very <unk> that this can bring a <unk> cell .
So I thought the only way to <unk> this <unk> so that you could <unk> the <unk> to <unk> some of these questions .
And so we started the <unk> of " Can we have a <unk> ? "
Can the chemical <unk> that we have never been able to do before before ?
And , in <unk> , can we make a <unk> ?
A <unk> is just a piece of <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The speed with which we 're able to <unk> life is <unk> to <unk> <unk> .
Our ability to write the <unk> code , instead of <unk> , but it 's <unk> .
And our <unk> <unk> the <unk> of <unk> .
We 've been more than 15 years ago .
The process has a lot of <unk> , <unk> with a <unk> <unk> before they <unk> the early experiments .
But we found that <unk> is very difficult .
There are <unk> of thousands of cars in the world that <unk> small <unk> of DNA , from 30 to 50 <unk> and it 's a <unk> process : the <unk> is <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
So we had to develop a new way to <unk> these <unk> and <unk> the <unk> .
And this was our first <unk> , starting to be <unk> from digital information of <unk> <unk> <unk> .
It 's a small virus that we can do .
We have designed <unk> , we <unk> the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> a <unk> of DNA <unk> , about <unk> <unk> .
The interesting part is when we took this piece of <unk> material <unk> , and we <unk> it in bacteria , bacteria have <unk> to read this code , and <unk> the <unk> particles .
<unk> <unk> have been <unk> by cells , they 're <unk> back , and they <unk> the <unk> <unk> .
I 've been talking about recently with the <unk> industry that they have certainly <unk> this model .
They <unk> more than you .
I think this is a situation where software can actually build its own <unk> in a <unk> system .
But we wanted to do the largest things .
We wanted to build the entire <unk> of <unk> .
They 're more than <unk> <unk> code .
So we thought I was going to <unk> in the size of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of a <unk> cell .
<unk> is <unk> , and if you <unk> information with a computer , these must be very <unk> .
When I <unk> this genome for the first time in <unk> , the standard <unk> was a <unk> for every 10 <unk> <unk> .
We 've discovered , <unk> , 30 <unk> . If you were using that original sequence , you 'd never been able to do it .
One part of the process is to design <unk> 50 <unk> <unk> <unk> to build smaller <unk> <unk> <unk> to build smaller <unk> <unk> <unk> to build smaller <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to build smaller <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
You 're going to be <unk> here .
You probably read that <unk> us from <unk> .
So , we have a <unk> code that 's <unk> on four <unk> : A , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> of those <unk> <unk> together <unk> about 20 <unk> , and there 's a <unk> order to <unk> every <unk> .
So we can use the code for <unk> words , <unk> , <unk> .
What we 've done at the beginning was <unk> .
Some of them were <unk> by the fact that it wasn 't <unk> .
We have designed these <unk> to just <unk> <unk> with <unk> .
There are <unk> that <unk> them and <unk> <unk> .
And we started to <unk> parts , <unk> with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> so that they <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to them , so that they <unk> <unk> <unk> .
But every step we 've made these <unk> in <unk> so that we can <unk> to create a very <unk> <unk> , which we 're going to create a very <unk> <unk> , as you 'll see in a minute .
We 're trying to <unk> the process .
So , this seems to be a <unk> <unk> of <unk> .
When you start these <unk> very <unk> , very <unk> , more than 100 <unk> <unk> , you don 't get <unk> in the <unk> <unk> .
You get to the <unk> of the <unk> biology .
So we 've <unk> other <unk> .
<unk> of another <unk> called <unk> <unk> , which in biology , <unk> to <unk> DNA that can <unk> the <unk> .
Here 's an example .
This <unk> , called <unk> <unk> , can <unk> three million <unk> <unk> .
You can see in the <unk> <unk> as his <unk> is <unk> .
<unk> , 12 hours , it 's been <unk> just like it was before .
<unk> thousands of organisms that are able to do it .
These organisms can be completely <unk> .
You 're going to live under <unk> .
I 'm absolutely sure life <unk> in space , and you <unk> to find new <unk> of water .
And actually , NASA <unk> that 's shown that .
This is a picture of the <unk> that we 've built these <unk> , just by using these <unk> , just using these <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> <unk> .
This image was not <unk> with a <unk> <unk> , but with a <unk> <unk> .
It 's such a <unk> that we can <unk> with a <unk> <unk> .
These are pictures that <unk> a period of about six seconds .
This is the <unk> that we 've done a little time ago .
They 're more than <unk> code <unk> .
It 's the largest <unk> of a <unk> <unk> <unk> from man .
It has a <unk> that 's <unk> <unk> .
If you <unk> it with a <unk> 10 <unk> , you 'll be <unk> pages to <unk> this <unk> code .
Now , how do we make it work ? How do we make it work ?
<unk> , by a virus is a <unk> <unk> .
It 's a little bit more <unk> when you use of bacteria .
It 's easier , even when it comes to <unk> cells like our : you just <unk> the <unk> and <unk> another , which is that almost the <unk> of <unk> .
In <unk> , the <unk> is <unk> in the cell , but we have <unk> <unk> that we 're able to make a <unk> <unk> of a cell <unk> from one cell to another cell and <unk> .
We have <unk> <unk> from a species <unk> .
<unk> are different as the men from <unk> .
We 've <unk> some <unk> in a way that we could decide which to <unk> that <unk> .
And then he <unk> with <unk> <unk> <unk> all the <unk> .
And when we put it in the cell was <unk> and <unk> our <unk> the new <unk> went into the cell .
And I would say we didn 't want to go beyond , but we tried to <unk> more <unk> in there .
This is one of the major <unk> of evolution .
We discovered that <unk> species have <unk> a second or a third <unk> somewhere , <unk> in a second thousands of new <unk> to that species .
So who thinks about evolution as one <unk> at a time you <unk> at the time you <unk> didn 't understand that much of biology .
We 're going to be <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> that was in the cell didn 't <unk> one .
The <unk> <unk> we have <unk> the <unk> .
It 's <unk> , and it <unk> the other <unk> as a <unk> material , <unk> it , and we <unk> with only cell with the new <unk> and the new <unk> .
It 's become blue because of the <unk> we have <unk> .
And in a short <unk> of time , all the <unk> of a species are <unk> , and it <unk> of all in a new species , <unk> on the new software that we <unk> in the cell .
All the <unk> are <unk> , the <unk> are <unk> , and when you <unk> the code , they 're <unk> to what we 've <unk> .
Now , this may seem <unk> <unk> , but by <unk> the software , we can change things in a pretty <unk> .
Now , I 've already <unk> that 's not about <unk> -- but it 's <unk> from <unk> million years and a half million years and a half of evolution , and I 've already said that maybe we 're going to create a new version of <unk> <unk> in which we <unk> new new species <unk> on this <unk> process .
Why do that ?
I think it 's pretty <unk> when we think about our <unk> .
We 're about to go from six and a half billion people in <unk> billion in the next 40 years .
Just to give one example : I was born in <unk> .
Now there are three people on the planet to <unk> <unk> in <unk> ; in 40 years , there 's going to be four .
We 're <unk> problems now to find food , water <unk> and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , six and a half billion people .
We were even more <unk> to do it for nine billion .
<unk> more than five billion <unk> <unk> .
That means 100 million <unk> a day .
When we try to find <unk> <unk> , or any kind of <unk> process to <unk> , it will be a huge challenge .
In more we have to realize that all of CO2 <unk> from these materials that <unk> in the atmosphere .
At the day , because of the <unk> <unk> all over the world , we have a <unk> with about 20 million genes , and I like to think that it 's the <unk> <unk> for the future .
The <unk> industry is only one <unk> about <unk> , and think about how many different things are <unk> out .
Our <unk> here is <unk> data from the <unk> reality , and our imagination .
Now we have <unk> , because of these <unk> <unk> <unk> , able to create what we call <unk> <unk> <unk> .
We can make a big robot that can produce a million <unk> a day .
Think of <unk> these 20 million different genes or try to <unk> the <unk> to produce <unk> or <unk> , new <unk> , we can change , because of a small team , and create more biology now than the last 20 years of science .
And it 's just a standard <unk> .
We can choose to <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
This is a <unk> of some software <unk> that we 're working on to be able to <unk> and design and design species on the computer .
Well , we don 't know how they 're going to be .
We know exactly what their <unk> code is .
Now we 're <unk> on the <unk> of <unk> generation .
You 've seen that <unk> from <unk> was an experiment .
We have <unk> to be <unk> by the third generation that we 're going to <unk> pretty soon from <unk> to <unk> <unk> like <unk> or different kinds of <unk> .
But the only way that biology can have a big impact without <unk> the cost of food and <unk> <unk> the cost of food and <unk> <unk> the <unk> would be CO2 as as much as much as 18 as we 're working for cells that are going to do this purpose , and we 're working the first <unk> generation in about 18 months .
The solar light <unk> with CO2 is a <unk> , but in our <unk> <unk> in the world , we 've found different <unk> .
This is a <unk> that we 've <unk> in <unk> .
It 's about <unk> feet deep deep at about <unk> feet of water .
We 're <unk> from CO2 using hydrogen <unk> as hydrogen <unk> .
We 're trying to figure out whether we can <unk> CO2 , which can be <unk> by <unk> , <unk> that CO2 in <unk> , to drive this process .
So we think we might be able to <unk> what the basic question of " which is what life is , we , we have the <unk> goal of <unk> the entire industry .
<unk> . If you can 't do this from TED , where can be ?
It 's got a major source of energy .
<unk> , we 're working for using the same <unk> to create <unk> .
You 've seen this year with flu , we 're always <unk> back a year and with a dollar in less when it 's about finding the right <unk> .
I think that you can change <unk> <unk> in <unk> .
And that 's how the future could begin to look like <unk> , now , the tree of evolution , <unk> with bacteria , <unk> , and finally <unk> cells .
We 're in so far from <unk> people .
Our purpose is to make <unk> enough to <unk> to try to <unk> . Thank you very much .
First of all I 'm going to show you , the <unk> possible , some <unk> work , some <unk> of the new technology that we have taken <unk> to <unk> <unk> at <unk> , almost a year ago . This is <unk> .
It 's a environment that you can <unk> is <unk> <unk> with a huge amount of data that <unk> with a huge amount of <unk> data .
We 're seeing <unk> <unk> of <unk> with a kind of <unk> <unk> and <unk> , for a quick <unk> , <unk> , <unk> the images like we want .
And it doesn 't matter how big the amount of information that we see , how big it is that it 's the <unk> of data or images .
Most of them are <unk> photographs , but this for example is a <unk> <unk> from the <unk> of <unk> , and <unk> in the <unk> of 300 <unk> .
It 's not any difference because the only thing you <unk> the <unk> of a system like this is the number of <unk> on your screen at any time . It 's also a very <unk> architecture .
This is a whole book , example of data , not about images .
This is <unk> <unk> <unk> . Every <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And to <unk> that it 's about just <unk> and not about images , we can do something like that , to actually see that it 's a real <unk> of the text , not of a picture .
It could be a way of <unk> to read a little <unk> book .
You don 't <unk> it .
This is a more <unk> example . This is a number of The <unk> .
Every image is the beginning of a <unk> .
And it really gives you the pleasure and the beautiful experience of reading the real <unk> version of a <unk> or a <unk> , which is for nature a <unk> of a half .
We also have something with the corner of this particular number of The <unk> .
We 've created a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> much higher than what you use in a normal <unk> , and we 've <unk> the content <unk> .
If you want to see the <unk> of this <unk> , you can see it here .
Or other models , or even <unk> <unk> .
And this really <unk> some of these ideas to <unk> the <unk> of space on the screen .
I would say that this <unk> to actually bring to <unk> and other <unk> <unk> , no longer to be <unk> .
Of course , <unk> is one of the most <unk> <unk> for this kind of technology .
And on this , I don 't want to lose time , if we don 't say we have <unk> <unk> to be able to <unk> in this field .
These are all the streets in the United States <unk> an image of NASA <unk> .
So now I 'm going to do something else .
This is actually alive on the web ; you can see it .
It 's a project called <unk> , which <unk> two different technologies .
One is <unk> and the other is a <unk> research that 's very interesting that made by <unk> <unk> , a <unk> student of Washington , with the <unk> of Washington , with the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And it 's alive on the web , <unk> <unk> .
You can <unk> when we do this kind of <unk> , where we do this kind of <unk> , and have this kind of experience <unk> .
But the <unk> <unk> of the images here actually has meaning .
The <unk> <unk> of the computer <unk> have <unk> these images together , so that they 're <unk> to the places that <unk> <unk> all <unk> <unk> on the <unk> <unk> <unk> were <unk> . And here you see some kind of <unk> <unk> , and these things have been <unk> .
I don 't know if I have time to show you some other environment .
There are a lot more <unk> .
I want to go directly to one of the <unk> of <unk> data , and this <unk> from a <unk> <unk> that we 've done for the first time , we 'll show you what 's really going to do with this technology , the <unk> technology , the <unk> . And it 's not <unk> <unk> . And it 's not so <unk> <unk> by the <unk> that we have the <unk> in the website .
We had to <unk> some <unk> and so on .
This is a <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> images of types in <unk> , other <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and so forth . You 're <unk> of these <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
So they 're all <unk> from <unk> and they were all <unk> at the <unk> level in this way .
And it 's possible to <unk> this way <unk> .
You know , I would never have thought of end up working for <unk> .
It 's very <unk> <unk> to <unk> this kind of <unk> here .
I think you 're going to see that it 's a lot of different kinds of <unk> : from the cell phones <unk> , a <unk> number , <unk> number , <unk> in this environment .
And if I can , I can , I can <unk> out to look for the <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , etc .
<unk> here is a series of photographs -- <unk> .
This is a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
We can go from <unk> to <unk> physics of this environment .
The point is that we can do things with social environment . This is now <unk> from <unk> data from the whole memory <unk> of how to <unk> the earth , from the point of view and <unk> all that data together .
All those pictures become <unk> together , more than the <unk> of the <unk> .
You have a model of the entire <unk> <unk> .
Think of this as <unk> <unk> 's work on Earth <unk> .
It 's something that 's going to <unk> complexity as people who <unk> it , and which <unk> for those who are <unk> it with the use .
Their pictures are <unk> with <unk> <unk> by other people .
If somebody comes the idea of <unk> all of these <unk> <unk> , my picture of <unk> <unk> <unk> , you know , my picture of <unk> <unk> , you know , you know , you know , you 're going to use as a <unk> point in that space , in that <unk> , in that <unk> , using the <unk> of anyone else , and <unk> .
Now , a <unk> of all of this is <unk> that 's extremely <unk> models of the earth , <unk> , <unk> not just by <unk> <unk> and <unk> and <unk> , but from <unk> <unk> .
Thank you very much .
CA : Can I understand that ? What your software your software will allow us to do is that at some point in the next few years , all the photographs that we 're in the entire world , basically <unk> by anyone in the world will be <unk> <unk> together ?
<unk> : Yeah . What 's doing is actually doing is to find out .
It 's creating <unk> , if you want , between images .
And it 's <unk> it 's <unk> .
What 's becomes very interesting if you think about the <unk> of information that many of these <unk> images .
As you do a <unk> , you get a <unk> and the text on the page , you <unk> , you <unk> a <unk> and the text on the page .
Now , what happens if that picture <unk> to all your pictures ?
So , the amount of <unk> and the amount of <unk> that <unk> is really huge . It 's a <unk> effect .
CA : <unk> , it 's really incredible . <unk> .
<unk> : I 'm going to show you very much .
One of the major <unk> when you <unk> and one of the <unk> research is that that can live between who has not <unk> the <unk> <unk> , who <unk> the past in the wind , the <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> from plants .
You might think that <unk> <unk> are still <unk> <unk> , or that <unk> <unk> <unk> are still <unk> <unk> of <unk> , or <unk> , <unk> still <unk> <unk> <unk> , or <unk> , the <unk> <unk> of <unk> , and that the idea that the world in which we live in which is not in a <unk> sense , but only is a model of reality , but only is a model of reality ,
the <unk> of a particular <unk> of <unk> choices that our <unk> has done , good or bad , many <unk> .
And , of course , everybody <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Everybody <unk> . Everybody <unk> .
We 're <unk> to <unk> .
We have to deal with the <unk> of death <unk> , so we don 't <unk> it if we were <unk> and <unk> --
We all have an art .
What <unk> is the <unk> of the song , the <unk> of every culture 's <unk> .
It doesn 't matter that matter the <unk> of <unk> , or the <unk> of <unk> <unk> , or the <unk> of <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , or a <unk> in the heart of <unk> .
He was my <unk> of journey in <unk> a month ago , or a <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> , on <unk> , <unk> , <unk> mother 's mother 's <unk> .
All of these <unk> that there are other ways of <unk> other ways of thinking , other ways of moving around the world .
And if you look at a minute , it 's a concept that can give you hope .
<unk> , the <unk> of the world create a <unk> of life <unk> and <unk> that <unk> the planet and is important for the <unk> of the planet , as the <unk> <unk> <unk> as a <unk> <unk> .
And you can think about this <unk> <unk> as a <unk> and you can <unk> the <unk> of all the <unk> , the <unk> of all the <unk> , dreams , <unk> , <unk> <unk> in being by human imagination of <unk> .
<unk> is the <unk> of humanity .
It 's the <unk> of what we are and what we can be as as <unk> species .
And <unk> <unk> was <unk> <unk> <unk> happened to the <unk> and <unk> much faster .
<unk> <unk> , for example , <unk> that 50 percent of all species has been or is on the <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> , just because it 's <unk> , or -- in the <unk> <unk> -- and you don 't even even even <unk> to <unk> -- the <unk> diversity .
The <unk> of all that is , of course , the <unk> <unk> .
When you 're <unk> <unk> on this planet .
A language is not just a <unk> or a series of rules .
A language is the <unk> of the human spirit .
It 's the <unk> that the <unk> of every culture comes in the world .
Every language is a forest of the mind , a <unk> , a <unk> of <unk> .
And of those <unk> <unk> , as we 're sitting here at least half is no longer <unk> in the <unk> of children .
They 're no longer <unk> to children , which means , unless you <unk> something , which is <unk> .
What 's more <unk> than being <unk> by <unk> , the last last last to speak a language , of not <unk> the <unk> of <unk> or <unk> <unk> the <unk> of <unk> or to <unk> the <unk> of <unk> or to <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> or to <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> or to <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> or to <unk> ?
This <unk> <unk> was a few of somebody in the world every two weeks , every two weeks , a <unk> <unk> and <unk> with itself in the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And I know you know some of you know , " <unk> 't that ?
The world wouldn 't be a better place if we all had the same language ? " <unk> , then we all talk about <unk> .
<unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> what it means , you can 't talk about your own language .
I 'd like to show you a journey through the <unk> --
a small journey in the <unk> to give you a <unk> of what we 're <unk> .
Many of us <unk> that when I say " different ways of <unk> . " I mean , very different ways of <unk> .
So , for example , <unk> <unk> <unk> , the <unk> of <unk> , which <unk> to the <unk> <unk> from the river <unk> of <unk> in the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
It 's a <unk> that 's not able to <unk> the blue color in green because the green <unk> because the <unk> is <unk> in the forest , which <unk> the <unk> .
They have a <unk> language and a <unk> rule , <unk> <unk> . " <unk> <unk> . " <unk> a person talking a different <unk> .
All of this has been <unk> in the past <unk> , but the <unk> is that in these families where you 're talking six or seven <unk> because of the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
You start listening and then you start talking about .
I was one of the most interesting <unk> that I 've been <unk> , the <unk> of <unk> <unk> , an incredible <unk> that has had the first <unk> in <unk> .
In <unk> , I 've got a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
They made out of <unk> , which <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> that this <unk> forest <unk> , <unk> that this <unk> forest <unk> had never seen anything .
They <unk> the pictures from the ground , <unk> <unk> to <unk> a form or a <unk> , and they didn 't know anything , they <unk> <unk> <unk> with <unk> .
But <unk> not only don 't <unk> .
They <unk> themselves .
<unk> percent of <unk> was <unk> by themselves .
We 're <unk> to eight <unk> and we found two natural <unk> , and when we <unk> to know , they <unk> that one of them was <unk> so that he died <unk> , and then <unk> the same same .
The <unk> were able to recognize the animal <unk> from 40 <unk> and <unk> the species .
In the early <unk> , I was <unk> a very interesting job , when my <unk> <unk> <unk> me if I wanted to go to <unk> in <unk> , I wanted to go to <unk> between <unk> society and <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
To give a sense of <unk> , I should have understand the <unk> culture , and that <unk> is not <unk> <unk> .
It 's pretty much of a <unk> <unk> view of the world .
Very interesting .
If you were <unk> to <unk> the <unk> of the world , what do you <unk> me ?
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> , etc .
A continent comes out , thinking about <unk> Africa has not <unk> <unk> . And you know , you know , Africa has not <unk> <unk> . And you know , it 's not what the <unk> of these <unk> <unk> very <unk> <unk> during the <unk> <unk> .
What makes it interesting is the <unk> <unk> relationship between life and death .
So <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> can be <unk> by the <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> .
And so , the <unk> <unk> <unk> go to <unk> to <unk> to speak of God .
We <unk> in <unk> and <unk> God . "
And from the moment that you 're <unk> , is the spirit that <unk> you can <unk> , how do you <unk> ?
So , you <unk> to these incredible events : <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a rather <unk> of the power of the body 's mind when it 's <unk> in a state of <unk> <unk> <unk> .
I 've been <unk> all the <unk> I 've lived with the most <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , in the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> of <unk> civilization that once <unk> on the <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> , the <unk> <unk> on the <unk> <unk> .
In a <unk> continent , this <unk> has never been <unk> by <unk> .
<unk> today are <unk> by a <unk> , but their <unk> is extraordinary .
<unk> <unk> from the families to <unk> <unk> for 18 years , and they live in a world <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> for <unk> for 18 years .
Two <unk> years old <unk> of nine years <unk> that <unk> in the <unk> of <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
For all this time , they 're <unk> to the values of their society , values that <unk> their <unk> and only their <unk> <unk> <unk> -- or to say the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The first time of this incredible <unk> , they 're <unk> out and for the first time in life , they 're going to see an <unk> . And that minute of the first <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , when the sun <unk> <unk> , all the <unk> of the <unk> , all that they have been <unk> in theory .
" <unk> ? I 'm going to show you .
It 's <unk> . Now it 's <unk> . "
They 're actually called <unk> , and they say that we , <unk> <unk> , we are the <unk> of the world 's <unk> .
This level of <unk> is extremely important .
When we think about <unk> and the environment <unk> <unk> and the old history of <unk> <unk> , which is a concept in its <unk> <unk> or maybe <unk> <unk> and say that these <unk> are <unk> to Earth than us .
<unk> <unk> are not <unk> or <unk> by <unk> .
There is no space for these things in the <unk> <unk> of <unk> or in <unk> <unk> <unk> , but because of time and <unk> , have created a <unk> of the Earth <unk> <unk> , but on a <unk> <unk> <unk> , but on a <unk> <unk> <unk> , but on a <unk> <unk> <unk> , but on a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
What does that mean ?
I mean that a <unk> of the <unk> that <unk> <unk> that the mountain is a spirit <unk> that <unk> its <unk> will be a human being <unk> , and it 's going to have a very different <unk> with the mountain or the place or the <unk> of a <unk> that <unk> <unk> that <unk> a mountain <unk> <unk> that <unk> a mountain is a <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> to be <unk> .
which is a spirit of one spirit or a <unk> <unk> is <unk> .
What 's interesting is the <unk> that <unk> the relationship between <unk> and the natural world .
I grew up in the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> to be <unk> .
That made me be a human being different from my <unk> friends who believe that <unk> are the <unk> <unk> and the <unk> <unk> of <unk> and the <unk> <unk> of <unk> and the <unk> <unk> that live in the world <unk> <unk> , which <unk> in the <unk> <unk> .
If you start <unk> that these <unk> can actually create different , you could actually start understanding some of their <unk> . They <unk> this <unk> .
I 've <unk> this picture in <unk> in <unk> <unk> .
Maybe some of you have heard about <unk> , the most powerful <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
What makes <unk> is not the <unk> potential of <unk> , but his <unk> . It 's <unk> by two elements .
On one hand , this <unk> <unk> that has a series of <unk> , <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
<unk> the only <unk> is a <unk> <unk> <unk> , but it 's <unk> with a little <unk> , but it 's <unk> with a <unk> 's family <unk> said <unk> .
This <unk> <unk> <unk> , very similar to <unk> , <unk> .
If you ever see the <unk> <unk> <unk> for the <unk> , the <unk> that they 're <unk> on a different <unk> of species , it <unk> <unk> .
<unk> that <unk> on the <unk> is a little bit of how you can be <unk> by a <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> on a sea of electricity . <unk> 't creates the <unk> of reality .
I often <unk> with my <unk> , Richard <unk> <unk> , the man who <unk> the age , was <unk> , with his discovery of the <unk> <unk> in the ' <unk> .
<unk> my <unk> cannot be <unk> because if you 're done you 're <unk> as <unk> because if you 're done you can 't tell no one of being <unk> . The <unk> cannot be <unk> because they 're <unk> by a <unk> that is , of course in <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
It 's possible to <unk> only if you <unk> with other <unk> <unk> that <unk> .
Now , it 's the nice thing : the <unk> that are in this <unk> are <unk> , <unk> of the same kind of <unk> for <unk> . The question <unk> <unk> : in a <unk> of <unk> species of plants , like these <unk> two <unk> , you don 't like that , but if you <unk> in this way , they create a <unk> version that 's <unk> <unk> <unk> .
We use the great <unk> of <unk> and <unk> , which can <unk> <unk> .
But if you look at <unk> , you 'll say , " The plants are talking . "
What does that mean ?
This <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> in the forest , and that our eyes <unk> in the forest , and our eyes <unk> in the same species .
If you <unk> like <unk> their <unk> will be , " <unk> <unk> " <unk> " <unk> " <unk> " <unk> .
The solution is : you take the <unk> <unk> <unk> in a night that <unk> <unk> <unk> with a different <unk> .
And you don 't <unk> to <unk> , but it 's much more interesting than <unk> <unk> .
Now , [ <unk> ] problem is that even the ones of us who have to heart <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> them , but in some way to <unk> history than our real world , and beyond .
In fact , the <unk> century , in 300 years , <unk> <unk> for his <unk> or <unk> <unk> , but rather like the <unk> was where we <unk> and <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> the mass <unk> of diversity and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> <unk> the planet . Now the problem is not change .
All the <unk> through the <unk> have been <unk> in a <unk> for new possibilities of life .
And the problem is not technology .
The <unk> <unk> didn 't have <unk> to be <unk> when they put <unk> <unk> and <unk> as <unk> , as <unk> didn 't have <unk> to be when they <unk> and <unk> .
It 's not change or technology that <unk> the <unk> of <unk> . It 's power .
The <unk> <unk> of <unk> .
And if you look at the world , you 'll see that these are not <unk> <unk> to <unk> .
They 're <unk> creatures and <unk> <unk> out of the <unk> of forces that go beyond their <unk> <unk> .
<unk> that <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> --
a <unk> <unk> <unk> , in <unk> <unk> <unk> , a <unk> that has been <unk> in the forest to a generation <unk> , and now <unk> to the <unk> and the <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> , where you can see the <unk> <unk> from the <unk> that seems to <unk> <unk> from the <unk> <unk> <unk> , where the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , where the <unk> <unk> <unk> , where the <unk> <unk> <unk> ,
I started to <unk> the <unk> with the <unk> <unk> to the forest .
Or , in the case of <unk> , it 's the <unk> discovery of <unk> .
If you <unk> on the <unk> of the <unk> , where I 'm doing a lot of research , you 'll see the <unk> <unk> of politics .
As <unk> <unk> , <unk> physics of a <unk> , is <unk> at <unk> level , but <unk> , the <unk> of <unk> <unk> . It 's not just <unk> , but <unk> <unk> in certain <unk> , because it 's part of development .
And you can 't understand the <unk> of the <unk> until you start .
I <unk> the <unk> miles from <unk> in China through the <unk> <unk> , <unk> to <unk> with a young <unk> , but only <unk> to <unk> . I realized what the <unk> is in the <unk> that you 're going to talk about .
<unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> million people <unk> from <unk> during the <unk> <unk> .
The father of this guy was <unk> at <unk> <unk> .
which means it 's been <unk> at the time of Chinese <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> during the <unk> that led the <unk> in <unk> .
My mother was <unk> and her <unk> was being <unk> .
It 's been brought to <unk> in <unk> at age two years of <unk> under her <unk> because she couldn 't have been able to live without him .
The <unk> , which has done the same , was <unk> in <unk> <unk> .
One day he <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> , and , for this <unk> , was <unk> to <unk> jobs for seven years .
The pain of <unk> can be <unk> , but the spirit <unk> of <unk> is by present <unk> .
And then , all you get to a choice .
Do you want to live in the <unk> world , or we want to <unk> the <unk> world of diversity in the diversity in the <unk> world ?
The great <unk> <unk> , before you die said that the largest fear was that his largest fear was that , in our <unk> <unk> <unk> to this <unk> <unk> <unk> of human imagination to a <unk> <unk> of human imagination to a <unk> <unk> of thinking , but a day it was <unk> us from a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that there were other possibilities .
And it 's <unk> to remember that our species has been <unk> for <unk> years .
The <unk> <unk> , which has given us , agriculture has made us <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> , <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> with the <unk> of the <unk> , creating the <unk> of <unk> , creating the <unk> of <unk> , and we talk about <unk> years ago .
The <unk> world has been <unk> 300 years .
That <unk> story , I don 't believe that we have answers to all the challenges that we <unk> to <unk> in <unk> .
When these <unk> <unk> of the world is asked what it means to be human , I 'm <unk> with <unk> different <unk> .
And it 's in these answers that all of us are the chance to be what we are , a <unk> species , which has to <unk> the whole <unk> and all the <unk> can <unk> . And there 's great moments .
I <unk> this picture on the north of <unk> island , when I went to <unk> <unk> with <unk> , and this man , <unk> , and this man , <unk> me , she <unk> the wonderful story of her <unk> .
The <unk> government wasn 't always <unk> with the <unk> <unk> and in the <unk> for the <unk> , and in the <unk> for the <unk> .
The <unk> of this man <unk> <unk> .
The family , <unk> for his life , <unk> <unk> all the <unk> , and all of her <unk> .
You want to know that <unk> don 't <unk> , <unk> .
The <unk> of <unk> were made of fish <unk> in skin <unk> .
The <unk> of this man didn 't <unk> <unk> from the night that <unk> .
It 's <unk> , it <unk> the <unk> in skin of <unk> and <unk> in your hand . When I did it , they <unk> it , it <unk> it into a <unk> .
It has <unk> <unk> on the <unk> of this <unk> <unk> , and when <unk> <unk> , he <unk> a dog .
He <unk> the dog and created a <unk> , with the <unk> <unk> has created a <unk> , he has <unk> another dog and she 's <unk> on the <unk> , <unk> <unk> in <unk> .
What about <unk> ?
<unk> <unk> the <unk> government <unk> to <unk> the <unk> control of a larger area of California and <unk> <unk> .
It 's their new <unk> . It 's called <unk> .
It 's a <unk> <unk> . It 's all the resources that we have to <unk> .
One <unk> example of how a <unk> can <unk> with his <unk> .
And , finally , I think it 's pretty <unk> at least who 's been in these <unk> <unk> of the planet , I realize that they 're not not going to be at all .
For somebody is home .
<unk> <unk> of the human imagination that <unk> to <unk> . And for us all , the dreams of these children , like the dreams of our children , as a part of the <unk> hope of the <unk> of hope .
<unk> , we <unk> <unk> we are <unk> that <unk> never <unk> to nothing .
I think you 're going to <unk> --
They 're not <unk> , but we believe that stories can change the world , and perhaps we are the best <unk> to tell the stories of the world . Every month our website <unk> <unk> million <unk> .
<unk> <unk> our <unk> <unk> .
Our <unk> are <unk> from millions of people .
Our work is <unk> in <unk> to bring our public <unk> in places that are <unk> by how they saw and , <unk> by how they saw and , <unk> , <unk> for <unk> <unk> of <unk> : the world 's <unk> of diversity , and we need to find a <unk> of life in a <unk> world and <unk> <unk> .
where the <unk> of all the <unk> can <unk> to our <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Thank you .
I 'm going to talk about some of the things that I 've written in this book that I hope you 've already heard and <unk> a few <unk> , in the case you didn 't .
I 'd like to start with what I call the <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> of what ?
The <unk> <unk> of all the <unk> <unk> <unk> . The <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> : " If we want to <unk> the <unk> of our citizens . " The way to do it is to <unk> freedom .
The reason is , on one side , in fact that freedom is in itself , is <unk> , useful , <unk> for humans .
On the other one is that if we are <unk> , every one of us can act to do for all of what we do do with our <unk> , without no one who 's going to have a name .
The way to <unk> the freedom is to <unk> choice .
More choices people , more <unk> , and more <unk> is their freedom , the more <unk> is their <unk> .
This , <unk> , is so <unk> <unk> in society that no one <unk> <unk> in <unk> .
And it 's also <unk> <unk> in our lives .
I 'm going to show you some examples of what progress has made possible .
This is my <unk> . It 's not particularly big .
I <unk> a simple note on <unk> <unk> to <unk> .
In my <unk> , there are <unk> <unk> , without <unk> the 10 <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> and 12 <unk> you can buy a huge number of <unk> in the <unk> <unk> that nobody of <unk> already is <unk> to your <unk> .
Here 's what <unk> is what <unk> is .
Then you go to the <unk> store for buy a <unk> : <unk> , radio , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
And in this single <unk> store , there 's a great number of <unk> <unk> .
We can make six and a half million different <unk> using the <unk> that there are in one store .
<unk> <unk> that there is <unk> choice .
<unk> <unk> : the world of <unk> .
Once , when I was a child , you could get all the services <unk> , <unk> <unk> that were <unk> by <unk> <unk> .
You <unk> the phone , you don 't <unk> it .
And a <unk> of that , by the way , was not going to be <unk> .
These days they went .
We have now a <unk> <unk> of <unk> , especially between cell phones .
That 's cell phones .
My <unk> is in the middle , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , and <unk> for <unk> <unk> .
If you haven 't seen yet in the <unk> store , you 're very <unk> that soon you 're <unk> .
And what happens is that people <unk> in <unk> and ask this question . And you know , what 's the answer is , " No .
It 's not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn 't do <unk> .
So , in other <unk> of life that are much more important than <unk> , <unk> the same <unk> of choices .
<unk> <unk> : No longer happens in the United States you 're going to be <unk> from <unk> and the <unk> <unk> you what you have to do .
Instead , you get out of the <unk> , and the <unk> says , " OK , you can do A , or <unk> , " he 's got these <unk> and these <unk> . What do you want to do ? "
You were <unk> , " <unk> , what do you want to do ? "
And the <unk> says , " He has these <unk> and these <unk> , and <unk> has these <unk> and <unk> . "
" What do you want to do ? "
And you say , " You know if you were me , what do you ask ? "
And the <unk> : " But I 'm not her . "
We call the " <unk> <unk> <unk> , " <unk> " <unk> " , " <unk> <unk> . "
But actually , it 's not a <unk> <unk> and responsibility to make decisions from someone who knows something , <unk> the <unk> , to <unk> , to <unk> that , to <unk> , to <unk> that you don 't know -- and almost certainly is <unk> -- and so not in the <unk> <unk> to make decisions about patient , which is <unk> .
There 's a huge <unk> of <unk> products , you know , you know , you know , that if you think of it doesn 't make any sense , because we can 't <unk> .
But if we can 't ask them , why would we <unk> them ?
The answer is that they want to <unk> , we call the <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> .
<unk> of so much as our <unk> , as we have now is a question of choice , as you see in this <unk> . " We don 't want to <unk> kids . <unk> their sex at the right time . " You don 't know .
And we can <unk> how many times we <unk> .
which means that every <unk> , <unk> , you have to decide that kind of person you want to be .
And I <unk> to the family and <unk> , a <unk> time perspective , almost almost for anyone , was that <unk> as soon as possible , and you were going to <unk> the <unk> as soon as possible .
The only real choice was with who , not when , and you didn 't even what to do next .
<unk> , it 's really to play .
They 're going to be very smart students , and they <unk> them to 20 percent less work than a time .
And not because they 're not <unk> , not because they 're less <unk> .
But why are they <unk> , they 're going to <unk> , " <unk> <unk> , or not ? "
" <unk> <unk> <unk> ? I have to think about <unk> , or my career ? "
They 're <unk> <unk> .
And they try to answer these questions , even though this <unk> , you don 't <unk> the <unk> that you 're going to <unk> and you don 't get a beautiful <unk> to my <unk> .
And they really need to do that . They 're important questions .
Now , the work : we 're <unk> , like <unk> <unk> , because technology <unk> us to work every minute , from every day , from every day of the planet , <unk> that from <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , there 's a <unk> , and I 'm not going to say to nobody , where the <unk> works .
I don 't tell you , because I want to use it .
What does this mean , this incredible freedom of choice that we have about work ? It 's that we need to decide , <unk> at all , if we have to work or not .
We can go to see our son to play <unk> , with the cell in one <unk> , the <unk> in the other , and the <unk> , <unk> .
And even though they 're all <unk> , every minute we see our son , I 'm also <unk> , " I <unk> to <unk> this call ? "
" I have to <unk> this <unk> ? I have to <unk> this letter ? "
And even when the answer is , " no , that makes the experience of your <unk> <unk> , very different from what it would be in other conditions .
So , from any part of you look , small things , big objects , materials and <unk> life , life is a question of choices .
Once the world was this : <unk> , there were some possibilities , but not everything was a question of choice .
The world of today is <unk> to this : The <unk> is , " It 's something <unk> , or <unk> ? "
The answer is <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> we all know , so I 'm going to talk about the <unk> .
I <unk> this choice is two effects effects effects of people .
The first , <unk> , is that <unk> <unk> instead of <unk> .
With a lot of <unk> between which choice , it becomes very difficult to do it .
I 'll give you an example of <unk> : a study <unk> on <unk> <unk> <unk> .
My <unk> has had access to <unk> data , <unk> society with about a million <unk> in <unk> different companies .
What she discovered is that for every 10 10 <unk> that are <unk> , the <unk> <unk> of two percent .
With 50 <unk> <unk> , there 's 10 percent less than <unk> you have when you 're only available to five . Why ?
Because with 50 <unk> between which <unk> , is to <unk> difficult to decide , and the choice is <unk> to <unk> .
And in <unk> , and again , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and of course , <unk> <unk> , never comes .
<unk> that means not only it 's these <unk> <unk> food to <unk> because they don 't have enough money , you want to say that the decision is so <unk> that you can <unk> <unk> <unk> of work .
<unk> 't <unk> , they 're not <unk> until five <unk> per year from <unk> of work , which would be <unk> <unk> .
So <unk> is a <unk> of having <unk> choices .
And I think we 're going to be the world like this .
" And finally , for <unk> : <unk> , <unk> , <unk> or <unk> ? "
I really want to make the right decision , if it 's for <unk> , right ?
You don 't want to choose the wrong wrong , and you 're going to <unk> the wrong <unk> .
So this is the first effect . The second is that even though we can <unk> <unk> and make choice , finally , we 're <unk> from the <unk> of how to <unk> them with less <unk> between which .
And that 's for different reasons .
One of them is that with a lot of <unk> between which choice , if you <unk> one , you know , it 's not perfect , it 's easy to imagine that they could be better . And what happens is that the <unk> <unk> us to <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> <unk> by <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> <unk> from <unk> , and the <unk> decision ,
even when it was a <unk> decision .
<unk> more choices , there are more <unk> than any <unk> that <unk> is <unk> of <unk> choice .
<unk> , there is what <unk> call .
Dan <unk> has very well <unk> like the value that we <unk> things from what <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> , when there are many <unk> possible , it 's easy to <unk> the <unk> of <unk> <unk> and be less <unk> than the <unk> that it 's choice .
Here 's one example . I 'm going to <unk> with all the ones that are not in New York .
But that 's probably <unk> .
There 's a <unk> to <unk> .
A place of <unk> .
<unk> <unk> . <unk> day . It 's all for them .
You 're not going to <unk> anything . But what he thinks is , " Well , <unk> . "
" All my <unk> <unk> are away . "
" <unk> <unk> <unk> just in front of home . "
And it <unk> two weeks from the idea that 's going to <unk> -- every day 's chance of <unk> where it wants .
The <unk> <unk> for what we have , even when the choice was <unk> .
And the most of the <unk> we have from <unk> , the more the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Here 's another example .
This <unk> us a lot of things .
It 's about living the moment , and perhaps of living living in the time .
But the most important point is that everything you <unk> , you 're going to be not to do others .
The things that they don 't have a lot of <unk> that can make less <unk> what we do .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> .
I tried it on my skin <unk> a new couple of <unk> .
It almost always <unk> .
Once the <unk> were in one of the <unk> , <unk> them and <unk> by <unk> , were <unk> , only after <unk> , they were <unk> , only after <unk> <unk> a lot of times , <unk> to go well .
So , I started to <unk> a new couple when the <unk> were gone , and I said , " I need a couple of <unk> , this is my <unk> .
The <unk> said to me , " Do you want to <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> ? "
You want them to <unk> or <unk> ? " <unk> " or <unk> " ?
" Do you want to <unk> ? "
" <unk> wants to <unk> or <unk> ? <unk> <unk> <unk> -- " <unk> to <unk> .
I was <unk> , and after a little bit I was able to say , " I want the guy that was the only guy , " I had a single guy . " I 'm all <unk> <unk> <unk> , then I <unk> up from the store , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , I had the <unk> of <unk> I ever had .
It was the <unk> . With all that choice I had <unk> .
But I 'm going to get worse .
Why ? I 've written a whole book to <unk> .
The reason I was worse is that with all the choice of my <unk> were <unk> , the <unk> <unk> to be <unk> .
I had <unk> <unk> . I didn 't <unk> anything about <unk> when I just <unk> a guy , but when I <unk> 100 different , you know , you know , at least one like , <unk> had to be perfect .
What I had <unk> was good , but not perfect .
After I <unk> that I was <unk> with what I was <unk> in <unk> to <unk> .
The <unk> of <unk> in the lives of people don 't make <unk> that these <unk> that have <unk> <unk> to the <unk> of the same .
And this is <unk> , even when the results are good .
<unk> in the world of <unk> if you realize that .
Because if you <unk> , I don 't know what I 'm talking about .
The truth is more than that .
" You know , " Well , the reason you were worse , " The reason you were better when you were worse , it was <unk> that when he was <unk> , he was still <unk> <unk> .
<unk> , in the world that we live in -- <unk> , <unk> citizens with the <unk> of <unk> -- the <unk> that we can <unk> is that things are at the <unk> of the <unk> .
You 've never <unk> <unk> because your <unk> , my <unk> , <unk> .
The <unk> of happiness -- what you 're here -- is , " <unk> <unk> <unk> , " Yeah , you want to . "
I mean , little <unk> moment -- I 'm really <unk> and my wife is really <unk> .
I couldn 't do better , I didn 't <unk> .
But <unk> , it 's not always <unk> .
<unk> , a <unk> of <unk> <unk> when you have a <unk> <unk> when you have that kind of <unk> is that when you 're not <unk> , and I 'm going to ask you , " Why ? "
" Who is <unk> ? " <unk> is <unk> .
The world is <unk> . What would I have to do ?
When you have hundreds of <unk> <unk> , and you get one <unk> , and you <unk> a <unk> , and you know who the <unk> is <unk> , it 's clear that you 're you .
You could have better done .
With hundreds of <unk> available , there are no <unk> for <unk> .
So when people make decisions , even though the <unk> is <unk> , they <unk> and they <unk> their own <unk> .
In the last few years , the <unk> is <unk> in the world .
I think a <unk> <unk> -- not the only , but important -- of this <unk> of <unk> is that people have <unk> experiences because the standard is too <unk> .
And when they need to <unk> this situation they think <unk> is them .
So the final result is that we 're better , <unk> , but we 're worse .
Let me show you .
This is <unk> <unk> , what we all take for good and it 's completely <unk> . It 's not true .
There is no choice <unk> that a little bit of choice is better than <unk> that you don 't know that much choice is a little bit of a choice is a little bit .
There 's a <unk> , <unk> . I don 't know what it is .
But I 'm quite sure we 've <unk> from a piece of the level where the choices <unk> our life .
Now , from a <unk> point of view -- I almost finished -- from a <unk> point of view , <unk> is <unk> .
What <unk> <unk> all of this choice in the <unk> society is the <unk> material .
There are many places in the world , and you know , <unk> <unk> , where the problem is not that they have <unk> choice .
The problem is they have too <unk> .
So , the <unk> I 'm talking about is a <unk> <unk> of <unk> , <unk> society .
And what <unk> does <unk> and <unk> is this : <unk> <unk> <unk> you 've talked about yesterday about how <unk> and <unk> <unk> to <unk> it is <unk> . It 's a <unk> of money .
I mean that these choices , <unk> and <unk> , is not just <unk> .
They 're <unk> <unk> .
They make us worse .
If you 're a little bit of what in our society <unk> , <unk> choice was <unk> in those where people have too few <unk> , it wouldn 't just be their life to <unk> , but our .
This is what <unk> call a <unk> <unk> .
A <unk> of income does well for everyone -- not just the poor -- because of this choice in <unk> that we 're <unk> .
To <unk> , " You can become everything you want to be --
<unk> , people of culture , <unk> : " What do you do ? "
" It 's <unk> that you can 't do anything in a glass <unk> . "
" A <unk> imagination , a <unk> vision of the world --
and I <unk> it like this , at the beginning .
But then , <unk> , I realized that that fish knows it .
Because the reality of the <unk> is that if you <unk> the <unk> , you know that , you can 't <unk> . You can 't <unk> the freedom . You <unk> the <unk> .
If you look at the <unk> <unk> , you can <unk> the <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Everybody needs a <unk> .
This is almost certainly too <unk> , maybe even for the fish , and it 's certainly for us .
But the <unk> of some <unk> <unk> is a <unk> for <unk> and , for <unk> .
Thank you very much .
