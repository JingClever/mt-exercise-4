<unk> year I showed these <unk> to <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> , which is almost three million years of the United States <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> 40 percent .
So , this <unk> the <unk> of the problem because it 's not <unk> the ice <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> is , in a sense , the heart <unk> of climate system .
It 's <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> in the summer .
The next next <unk> is going to be a <unk> <unk> on the last 25 years .
<unk> <unk> are <unk> in red .
And as you see , you <unk> up to the blue <unk> .
That 's the ice in <unk> , which is <unk> in summer .
You can see that the <unk> ice <unk> , five years , it 's like the blood , which here is <unk> from the body .
In 25 years , it 's been so , in 25 years .
This is a problem because the <unk> <unk> in the ocean <unk> , where there are huge <unk> of <unk> <unk> that , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> are <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> are <unk> in <unk> .
<unk> to the <unk> of <unk> <unk> from global <unk> , which is <unk> , <unk> this point of not <unk> .
In a little <unk> <unk> in <unk> , the <unk> is already <unk> from the water .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> ! <unk> : She 's good . <unk> : She 's good .
A reason is that this <unk> <unk> <unk> from the north .
This is a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> had never <unk> <unk> <unk> .
This is the <unk> <unk> , in the <unk> of <unk> .
If you want to know how the <unk> <unk> on the <unk> <unk> on <unk> , here 's where the sea .
These <unk> are <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> , the largest <unk> of the planet : <unk> , the largest <unk> of the planet .
And the last month , the <unk> scientists have <unk> that the ice is in <unk> , and that the <unk> <unk> on some <unk> <unk> , is particularly <unk> in <unk> .
<unk> at six feet of the <unk> , as <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , you see new <unk> , which is new <unk> , which few years ago were <unk> .
<unk> percent of the world 's population <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> : This <unk> is the source of the water <unk> of this city .
<unk> is <unk> .
But when I <unk> , the same happens to the water .
<unk> California <unk> on <unk> <unk> is <unk> <unk> percent .
<unk> <unk> are in the crisis .
<unk> , as you read , they 're <unk> .
<unk> <unk> in the world door to a <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> are <unk> to a <unk> out of the normal and without <unk> .
<unk> times over the last 30 years of <unk> <unk> .
This is a <unk> of all <unk> .
If you look at the context context of the <unk> , if you can see the <unk> .
In the last five years , we 've been <unk> 70 million <unk> of CO2 every day .
Look at the <unk> <unk> , from <unk> , from <unk> , <unk> , and both parts of the <unk> <unk> , where there 's a <unk> <unk> <unk> in the oceans .
The <unk> of global warming , together to <unk> , which is 20 percent , is the use of <unk> <unk> .
The oil is a problem , and the <unk> is even worse .
The United States are one of the two countries with <unk> emissions , together .
And it 's <unk> of building a lot of other <unk> .
But we 're <unk> to a <unk> of direction .
These are the <unk> projects in the last years and some <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And so there 's a <unk> politics in our country .
<unk> and <unk> have <unk> million dollars in the last year to <unk> <unk> <unk> , which is a <unk> .
<unk> image I <unk> something --
<unk> <unk> , in <unk> , where I live , there was a <unk> of <unk> billion <unk> of <unk> .
Maybe you saw it on the <unk> .
This is the largest <unk> <unk> in America .
It 's happened around <unk> .
<unk> <unk> of one was this .
<unk> : <unk> â™« <unk> is a <unk> and happy .
It 's <unk> here in America , and it 's going to grow our economy .
<unk> the <unk> is more <unk> .
It 's <unk> , <unk> and <unk> and <unk> <unk> it .
<unk> : <unk> here is a lot of <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The largest society <unk> on the <unk> is <unk> . This is his <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> : <unk> <unk> -- Al <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> -- not know what they 're talking about .
<unk> : So the <unk> for the <unk> <unk> has <unk> two <unk> .
This is one of them , a part .
<unk> : <unk> : <unk> <unk> : <unk> <unk> as a <unk> <unk> to our business .
For this our <unk> is <unk> a big amount of money in a <unk> <unk> to make a public and <unk> the truth on <unk> .
It 's actually , <unk> is not <unk> .
We think it 's <unk> -- it 's also a good <unk> .
So , we didn 't know about climate change .
We 're going to do it .
<unk> : <unk> : <unk> <unk> -- you 've heard a lot of it .
So , I <unk> a <unk> structure of <unk> as it is about <unk> <unk> .
<unk> ! <unk> are a little <unk> , but this is the sound of technology <unk> .
<unk> <unk> is between <unk> is <unk> <unk> , but the <unk> technology <unk> , but the technology <unk> <unk> that you see changes everything .
And I look at a one : this is the <unk> technology .
<unk> : <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to the economic <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> : <unk> is in the crisis ; the national security crisis , the <unk> crisis .
The <unk> that <unk> all : our <unk> from <unk> <unk> , as the <unk> <unk> and oil <unk> .
Now , but there 's a new , <unk> solution to <unk> .
<unk> America : 100 percent of energy <unk> , in 10 years .
A plan for <unk> America to work , <unk> , more <unk> , and help <unk> the global <unk> .
<unk> , a solution that we could solve our problems .
<unk> America . <unk> .
<unk> : This is the last .
<unk> : <unk> : <unk> . It 's about <unk> energy .
One of the most <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> from the <unk> that we <unk> our planet .

<unk> : A old <unk> says , " If you want to go to go , you go from the only .
If you want to go , you go together . "
We have to go away , quickly .
Thank you very much .
<unk> year I made a <unk> on <unk> .
And I 'm going to <unk> to <unk> on how it works .
So here 's . And for the ones that the other time there were no , the <unk> is the largest <unk> experiment ever <unk> -- <unk> miles of <unk> .
His task is to <unk> the conditions that were in the <unk> of a second from the beginning of the universe -- until <unk> million times a second .
All of this is just <unk> .
This is the car <unk> .
And they <unk> these <unk> <unk> into the <unk> .
This is what I work . It 's called <unk> -- it 's <unk> <unk> <unk> feet and it 's a <unk> <unk> .
This is an <unk> image of <unk> in building so you can see the <unk> .
The <unk> last year we <unk> the machine .
And this picture was <unk> by <unk> .
It was because of <unk> <unk> in the <unk> .
It 's an image of the first <unk> of particles that had done all over the <unk> , <unk> in <unk> , <unk> , with a part of the <unk> , and <unk> particles inside the <unk> .
In other words , when I <unk> that image , the 10 <unk> , <unk> that the <unk> machine , which is a big <unk> .
I don 't know if it was that to make us more or this , when somebody <unk> on Google and <unk> that the page was this .
What 's means we had a <unk> impact beyond that .
And a week later , there was a problem with the machine , we had to these <unk> here -- these <unk> <unk> .
These <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> when the machine works at the <unk> .
Now , the <unk> between you <unk> and <unk> , " It 's not true . I 'm too <unk> . "
And they can do it because when they 're very <unk> <unk> .
So , at least <unk> degrees , at a temperature <unk> to that the <unk> of the stars , these <unk> can bring that <unk> .
In one of the <unk> <unk> in the <unk> , there was a <unk> <unk> .
So the <unk> <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> .
This was the result .
Now , this is still more <unk> if you think this is more than 20 <unk> , and that 's <unk> of about 30 <unk> .
It 's about 50 <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , what we did .
We <unk> them and <unk> .
Now they 're <unk> all in their <unk> .
It 's going to be the <unk> of <unk> is going to be new <unk> .
<unk> , and we <unk> to get <unk> data to get to <unk> or <unk> , and we continue to <unk> that we 're the <unk> that <unk> the universe .
Now , of course , in a way , these <unk> <unk> the <unk> on the value of science and engineering <unk> . It 's easy to <unk> .
I think the fact that it 's so hard , the fact that it 's the value of things like <unk> .
I 'd like to <unk> with the words of a <unk> <unk> , which <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , his <unk> was Michael <unk> , his <unk> was Michael <unk> , he said , " No , " is a lot of <unk> to the human mind as the ideas that the ideas of the human ideas that the ideas of science , and <unk> <unk> , which are <unk> by <unk> <unk> , which we 're not <unk> ,
Thank you .
I want to start <unk> to <unk> when , from children , <unk> with <unk> .
As <unk> as <unk> and <unk> and <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> is <unk> <unk> to the way that most <unk> part of the world around us .
So , from <unk> <unk> from <unk> of our <unk> with <unk> objects , and my <unk> <unk> , and my <unk> <unk> <unk> , and my <unk> <unk> <unk> , I started <unk> , " And if we use a computer , instead of having the <unk> <unk> as a digital <unk> , which is <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
and <unk> to our <unk> ?
The question was so interesting that we tried to explore the answer , building the <unk> .
In a few words , a <unk> is a big <unk> .
In a few words , a <unk> is a big <unk> .
You can <unk> them with the hand , you can <unk> them , " <unk> " between them , " <unk> " and they have a <unk> and a <unk> .
But <unk> , they 're <unk> , as <unk> , you can just <unk> .
<unk> are the <unk> of a new <unk> of tools for <unk> the digital information .
And as they 're <unk> , <unk> <unk> of the <unk> , <unk> of the other , and as they 're <unk> , <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> , of the other , of how we can explore new and <unk> <unk> <unk> .
So , I 'm going to <unk> with some simple example .
This <unk> is <unk> to show the video : if you <unk> it in a direction , the video <unk> <unk> so , if you <unk> on the other side <unk> back .
These <unk> <unk> are <unk> of others .
If you <unk> them , you <unk> to what they 're around .
If they 're <unk> , they can <unk> it and they can <unk> it a little bit .
If they 're <unk> , they can <unk> it and they can <unk> it a little bit .
They also <unk> their movement and <unk> .
And then we realized that one of the interesting <unk> of the <unk> was the <unk> that we can use <unk> <unk> on data , to the <unk> <unk> .
In this case , we have three <unk> <unk> as a <unk> and <unk> <unk> in the <unk> , and I can <unk> to <unk> <unk> .
and I can <unk> to <unk> color in the central one , where you get <unk> .
If you get too , we can <unk> a little place .
And I 'm also <unk> <unk> , as the <unk> , the mathematics and <unk> <unk> where people are trying to try to try to do things things quickly , and <unk> the results immediately .
Now I 'm --
This is a <unk> sequence that I do with a <unk> program .
And here we have a <unk> of words that 's <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> , at every <unk> <unk> a letter to <unk> a letter to each <unk> , <unk> a letter to a letter to each <unk> , and as <unk> <unk> of <unk> , and as <unk> <unk> <unk> , he <unk> on a <unk> .
And then , after about 30 seconds , you <unk> , and you have a new <unk> of <unk> and new possibilities to try .
Thank you .
So here 's the kids <unk> in <unk> <unk> , I 've made them in a way that <unk> them and I <unk> them a video .
They 're very <unk> .
And one of the interesting things of this kind of <unk> is that you don 't have to give people a lot of <unk> .
You just just say , " <unk> of the words , " and they know exactly what to do .
So here 's other people who <unk> .
This is our <unk> <unk> <unk> , there 's the right .
It 's actually wanted to <unk> .
They were only <unk> for him .
Now , this is a <unk> of a <unk> <unk> .
<unk> building a <unk> for the <unk> of the <unk> . He 's <unk> .
It can <unk> new characters in the <unk> , <unk> their <unk> .
It can <unk> new characters in the <unk> , <unk> their <unk> .
So here 's what 's doing .
<unk> : The sun is <unk> .
David <unk> : Now he brought a <unk> in the <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> .
<unk> ! <unk> !
So , <unk> <unk> and <unk> can make the characters --
<unk> : <unk> !
-- I <unk> your story .
<unk> : <unk> !
<unk> : It 's a <unk> story , and you can decide him as you can <unk> .
<unk> : It 's a <unk> story , and you can decide him as you can <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> .
<unk> : The last example I have the time to show is a <unk> , I was a <unk> , to <unk> and <unk> music .
It 's a <unk> , made of <unk> , for <unk> and <unk> music .
The <unk> here <unk> from <unk> as the bottom and the <unk> .
And you can have four different <unk> , and you can choose what you can have .
You can also <unk> these <unk> in a sequence of <unk> in a <unk> .
And I just <unk> by doing <unk> a sound and a sequence . "
These are actually you can control from live , as the <unk> and the <unk> .
And then I <unk> it to a particular sound and then <unk> to <unk> .
And then there are the <unk> , as long and <unk> , which <unk> to <unk> the whole sequence .
It 's <unk> as it works .
<unk> : <unk> : <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> in two <unk> , " <unk> in a series , the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
Now , I 'm going to <unk> a <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> : Now , <unk> <unk> of <unk>
<unk> : <unk> : And now I <unk> the <unk> to <unk> , so I can control the effect of the live <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> : I can <unk> the entire <unk> <unk> the time from one one side or another .
<unk> : <unk> : And now we <unk> the <unk> to give more <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> : I can <unk> the sequence . "
So I don 't have to <unk> before , but I can <unk> , <unk> , <unk> ,
And now , finally , I can <unk> the whole <unk> <unk> on the left <unk> . "
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is to build new <unk> <unk> <unk> more <unk> to how our brain work and body .
And today , I 've had time to show one of the results of this , and also some <unk> that we 're trying to bring out of the lab .
And the concept I want to <unk> is that 's going to be <unk> this new generation of objects to <unk> with the <unk> media , which we want to do .
Thank you very much .
I don 't see the <unk> to talk to all of you .
I 'm a <unk> .
<unk> books is my <unk> , but it 's more than this , of course .
It 's also also love and the <unk> of my life .
And I don 't look like that it can change .
But , said , this , something particular happened in my life and my career , which <unk> me to <unk> the whole relationship with this work .
The particular thing is that I wrote this book , this <unk> called " <unk> , " <unk> , " which , " which , <unk> from my <unk> books , for some reason reason in the world and <unk> a big , <unk> <unk> .
And the result is that everywhere <unk> now , people <unk> me as if I was <unk> .
<unk> -- <unk> , <unk> !
<unk> to me now all <unk> and they say , " You don 't know , I 'm going to be able to do better ?
You don 't know , you don 't know , to write the whole life without any more able to create a book that can <unk> to someone ? "
What can you get to someone ? "
It 's <unk> , you know .
But it could go worse , and that I remember 20 years ago , when I started saying to say to people -- I was a <unk> -- I was a <unk> .
<unk> <unk> to the same <unk> <unk> .
And people said , " Don 't you know , " Don 't you know to have success ?
You don 't know that the <unk> of <unk> <unk> ?
You don 't know , you don 't do this <unk> for all life , which is going to be out and die on a <unk> of <unk> with the <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> ? "
So , you know .
The answer -- the short answer to all these questions is , " Yeah . "
Yeah , I fear of all those things .
I 've always had fear .
And I 've also fear of many other things that people don 't <unk> .
As the <unk> and other things <unk> .
But , as it 's about the write about what I thought and <unk> <unk> is why ?
Is it <unk> ?
It 's <unk> that anyone who <unk> <unk> to be <unk> by a job that you feel born to do .
But what 's so particular in <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in a way that other <unk> <unk> in a way that other <unk> do not ?
As my father , for example , he was a <unk> and not remember one time in his 40 years of activity in the 40 years of activity in which he was asked to be <unk> ?
And it was never -- that <unk> of John <unk> , how does it ?
You don 't know , <unk> ?
<unk> , engineers <unk> as a group of course , engineers like a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
We <unk> , we have enough this <unk> , and not only <unk> , but we have this <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
And not to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that , only in the <unk> century , <unk> <unk> , <unk> young and often for them .
And the ones that don 't seem to be <unk> by their <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> , before you 're going to die , in the last <unk> said , " Every book , I got a little more <unk> about the work of their life .
But we didn 't <unk> when we say , because we heard these things so long , so long , we have <unk> and <unk> the <unk> that creativity and <unk> are in some <unk> way that the art , at the end , at the end , <unk> to <unk> .
And the question I want to <unk> to all here is , you 're <unk> with this idea ?
So , it 's good to you -- because it 's also <unk> from a <unk> <unk> to me .
I think it 's <unk> .
And I think it 's also <unk> and I don 't want to <unk> in the next century .
I think it 's better than our big <unk> <unk> to live .
And I know , in my case -- in my situation -- it 's going to start to <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in which I 'm in my career .
<unk> -- look at , I 'm pretty young , I have about 40 years .
I still have about four <unk> of work in me .
And it 's very <unk> that anything <unk> of now in the world as the work that 's going to be <unk> from the world as the work that after the <unk> success of my last book .
<unk> <unk> , because we are all more or less friends here -- it 's <unk> that my greatest success is to my <unk> .
Oh , <unk> , who thought !
You know , this is the kind of thinking that leads a person to start <unk> <unk> to the nine of the morning and I don 't want to do it .
I love to keep doing this work that I love .
So , the question becomes , how ?
And so I think , after many <unk> , which the way of working to keep going to write is to create a <unk> <unk> <unk> , right ?
I have to find a <unk> distance between me , which I 'm <unk> , and my natural <unk> on which is going to get and <unk> on what 's going to get to look at at the time , and I was <unk> to find other society to see if we 're going to get better and find other society , and to find more <unk> , and I 'm going to see if we 're more <unk> <unk> and more <unk>
about how to help people <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of creativity .
And that research brought me to <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
And I 'm going to go back to <unk> and then <unk> back .
<unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> -- people don 't believe that creativity <unk> from men , OK ?
It <unk> that creativity was this spirit <unk> and <unk> to men from a few <unk> and <unk> , for <unk> and <unk> , for reasons and <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of creativity <unk> .
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> of having a <unk> <unk> <unk> from <unk> .
<unk> were the same idea , but <unk> that species of the spirit without a <unk> .
And the <unk> , because the <unk> didn 't really <unk> that a <unk> was somebody who was particularly smart .
And I thought that a <unk> was this kind of <unk> <unk> that <unk> literally <unk> in the <unk> of the study of a artist , a little bit like the <unk> <unk> , and that <unk> out out out of the artist and <unk> the result of that work .
<unk> <unk> <unk> : here 's the distance of which I talk -- that <unk> <unk> you <unk> from the results of your work .
And all of course , who was so <unk> , right ?
So the artists were <unk> by <unk> things , as as a too <unk> , for example , isn 't it ?
If your work was <unk> not <unk> to <unk> all of <unk> , all of <unk> that <unk> was <unk> by this <unk> <unk> .
If your work , you didn 't know all your work , right ?
All of <unk> that was your <unk> to be a <unk> .
And so people <unk> <unk> creativity in <unk> for a long time .
And then the <unk> and all <unk> , and <unk> this big idea ; we put the human <unk> to the center of the universe on the center of the universe that <unk> <unk> from <unk> .
This was the <unk> <unk> and <unk> people to think that creativity is completely <unk> from <unk> .
And for the first time in the history , <unk> to this or that artist as a <unk> <unk> <unk> to a <unk> person with <unk> .
And I have to <unk> , I think it was a big <unk> .
I think I 'm going to someone , a simple person to believe that you know , as a <unk> as a source , <unk> and <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> is a responsibility to <unk> <unk> .
It 's as <unk> somebody to <unk> the sun .
<unk> and <unk> the <unk> and <unk> all of these <unk> <unk> on the <unk> .
And I think it 's been this pressure to have <unk> artists in the <unk> 500 years .
And if this is true , and I think it 's , and I think it 's the question is , and now ?
Can we do it <unk> ?
<unk> to a more <unk> of the relationship between humans and <unk> <unk> .
Or maybe no .
Maybe we can 't <unk> 500 years of <unk> thinking in a talk about 18 minutes .
And there 's probably people in the audience who <unk> <unk> <unk> on the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , you do that <unk> people <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> on their projects .
You probably don 't just just <unk> to this thing .
But the question I want to <unk> is -- why ?
Why don 't you get this way ?
Because it 's more sense of all other thing that has ever heard to explain the <unk> of the <unk> process .
A process that , as anyone who ever <unk> to do something -- so , basically , all here -- you know , you know , you don 't get <unk> .
And in fact , it 's a completely <unk> .
I 've been <unk> with the <unk> <unk> <unk> , which has now 90 years , but that was a <unk> for all life and said that in his <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> , <unk> out in the <unk> <unk> , <unk> out in the <unk> , and the <unk> , and the <unk> , in the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
He said he was like a <unk> <unk> .
And that <unk> <unk> to her from <unk> .
And he <unk> it , because he was <unk> the earth on his feet .
<unk> to have one thing to do at that point and was , words , and he was , his <unk> as a <unk> . "
And so I was <unk> to the house and it was <unk> by this <unk> , and it didn 't have to take a piece of paper and a <unk> enough <unk> , as the <unk> and <unk> on the page .
And sometimes I didn 't <unk> to be <unk> , so <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> without able to get home and the <unk> and she would <unk> to <unk> through the <unk> and she would <unk> it to <unk> through the <unk> , and he would <unk> it to <unk> through the <unk> , and he would be <unk> with the <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> to <unk> the
And then there were the <unk> -- this piece of never -- there was no <unk> , there were the <unk> , right ?
So , he was <unk> and he was looking at the paper and the <unk> <unk> through , and <unk> a <unk> <unk> in the while that was <unk> , and then he was <unk> , and then he was as if you <unk> with the other hand and the <unk> .
<unk> the <unk> from the tail and the <unk> in his body and the <unk> on the page .
And in these cases , the <unk> would be <unk> on the <unk> and <unk> , but at the <unk> , from the last word to the first word .
So when I <unk> <unk> -- it 's <unk> , it 's exactly <unk> to my <unk> process .
Not all my process -- I 'm not a <unk> .
I 'm a <unk> , and my way of <unk> is ; <unk> at the same <unk> every day and <unk> and work on <unk> .
But even I had to my <unk> , I got against that , and I got against that , sometimes .
And I 'm going to <unk> that even a lot of you the <unk> .
You know , even though the work and ideas <unk> me <unk> to a certain source , I couldn 't <unk> <unk> .
And what is this thing ?
And as we can <unk> it in a way we don 't have to get your head , but rather , what 's going to do you know ?
For how much , I have been <unk> <unk> , which I have been <unk> <unk> <unk> , which I have <unk> different years ago for a <unk> .
<unk> to this , and you know , <unk> , for the <unk> of life was the <unk> of the <unk> artist <unk> , trying to control , <unk> these species of <unk> <unk> .
But then <unk> , he was <unk> , and a day , and a day , he was <unk> on a <unk> <unk> , <unk> everything for him .
<unk> , <unk> and all of a <unk> <unk> this little <unk> , which is <unk> in his head as a <unk> , <unk> and <unk> and <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> , and the <unk> , but it 's not like <unk> .
It 's not a piece of paper , it 's not a <unk> .
So it starts to hear this kind of old <unk> <unk> in him , " I 'm going to lose , and <unk> <unk> from this song .
I 'm not enough <unk> and I can 't <unk> . "
And instead of going to go to the <unk> , they <unk> .
<unk> the whole process <unk> and did something completely new .
<unk> just the sky and said , " <unk> , you don 't see that I 'm <unk> ? "
" It seems to you can write a song ?
If you really want to <unk> , you 're going to get a more <unk> when I can <unk> care of you .
<unk> , <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> . "
And his process <unk> <unk> after this .
Not the work , the work was still <unk> as always .
But the process , and the <unk> <unk> was <unk> when <unk> the <unk> , the <unk> that was <unk> when <unk> the <unk> , the <unk> that turns out of the <unk> <unk> <unk> on where it was , which was <unk> that it didn 't want to be a <unk> and <unk> .
But I <unk> this <unk> , wonderful <unk> <unk> a conversation between <unk> and this thing <unk> and <unk> and <unk> that but it was not <unk> .
So , as <unk> that story <unk> to change a little bit about the way I 'm going to <unk> and already <unk> me a time .
This idea , I was <unk> when I was <unk> , " <unk> , " <unk> , " and <unk> in one of the <unk> of the <unk> in which we 're working on something and we don 't start to think that 's going to be a <unk> , which is going to be a <unk> , which is going to be the <unk> book .
Not just <unk> , just <unk> book .
And I started thinking about <unk> this project .
But then I <unk> to me to <unk> that <unk> to the air and <unk> us .
So I <unk> my face in the <unk> and <unk> my <unk> to a <unk> <unk> in the room .
And I said to <unk> <unk> , " <unk> , what if this book is not going to be <unk> my <unk> , it 's not going to be <unk> my , no ?
Because as you see I 'm <unk> all of the thing I have , I didn 't have more of this .
So if you want you to get it and do your part .
OK . But if you don 't do it , you know , what , I didn 't do it .
I started to write the same because it 's my work .
And I want to <unk> that was <unk> that I got to do my part of the <unk> , " because -- at the end is so , OK -- <unk> <unk> <unk> in the North people <unk> to <unk> the <unk> , and <unk> music that <unk> that <unk> <unk> to <unk> and <unk> music that <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> music that <unk> <unk> , and <unk> music <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> ,
And they were always <unk> , because the <unk> were <unk> and they were <unk> .
But every <unk> , something <unk> , something <unk> , and one of these <unk> <unk> actually <unk> .
And I know you know , I talk , because I know you 've got all of it , a <unk> .
It was like if the time , he was <unk> through a kind of <unk> and was doing nothing different from the <unk> , and he was <unk> .
And a sudden , you didn 't just like a human .
But it 's <unk> and <unk> in <unk> in the <unk> .
And when this <unk> , at the time , people <unk> what was , he <unk> it with his name .
<unk> your hands and <unk> to <unk> , " <unk> , <unk> , God , God , "
That 's God , you know .
<unk> <unk> -- when the <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> this <unk> <unk> with them and <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> , <unk> , " <unk> , " <unk> , " <unk> , " <unk> , " <unk> , " which you can still hear in the <unk> or <unk> .
In <unk> , when a <unk> <unk> , a <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> -- a <unk> of God .
And it 's <unk> because we need .
But , the problem comes the next day , for the <unk> , when you <unk> and <unk> and <unk> that are the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> God 's not more .
It 's just a <unk> with a lot of <unk> to <unk> , and maybe never <unk> to that <unk> <unk> .
And maybe nobody <unk> the name of God still as <unk> , and what 's going to do with the rest of his life ?
It 's hard .
This is one of the most <unk> <unk> to do in a <unk> life .
But maybe it 's not to be so <unk> if you 're <unk> to believe , <unk> , which the most <unk> of your being being from you .
But I just <unk> that you 're <unk> to <unk> from a source of this <unk> part of your life you have to go to <unk> .
And , you know , if we think about this way .
And so I started <unk> , and it 's been <unk> , and it 's been <unk> for different months in the book that was going to soon , the <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> of my <unk> success .
And what I have to continue <unk> when I feel <unk> from this is , I don 't fear .
You don 't just <unk> . <unk> just your work .
You 're going to <unk> for your side , any one can be .
If your work is <unk> , <unk> .
If you <unk> , you 're going to <unk> you to <unk> some kind of <unk> , for a moment through your <unk> , then you know , " <unk> ! "
<unk> , you do the same <unk> .
And " <unk> ! " <unk> ! "
I think and I got <unk> .
" <unk> ! " <unk> ! " <unk> , even for having <unk> love and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Thank you .
Thank you .
<unk> : <unk> !
As you know , I 've been talking about some of these projects on the human genome , on what it can <unk> and <unk> of new <unk> .
Now we 're <unk> a new <unk> , we started <unk> biology and now start from that digital code , we 're <unk> in a new <unk> of biology , <unk> and <unk> life .
We 've always been trying to <unk> big questions .
" <unk> is life ? " It 's something that many <unk> I think they have <unk> to understand to various levels .
We tried <unk> <unk> , <unk> to <unk> terms .
We 're <unk> from almost 20 years .
When we <unk> the human genome <unk> to <unk> from the world of biology world .
Now , we can <unk> life , or create new life from this digital universe ?
This is the map of a little <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , which is the species from the <unk> genome between those that can <unk> in the lab .
And we tried to <unk> the genome to <unk> a little bit smaller .
We 're able to <unk> a <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> that are here .
But when we have a look at his <unk> map , it 's <unk> simple than our .
<unk> , this is simple .
But when we look at all the genes that we can <unk> , one at the time , is very <unk> that this can bring to a <unk> cell cell .
So I thought that the only <unk> <unk> was <unk> this <unk> in a way that we <unk> <unk> the <unk> to <unk> some of these questions .
And so we started the <unk> of the " Can we <unk> a <unk> ? "
Can the chemistry <unk> of produce these big molecules that we never have ever been able to create before ?
And in case , <unk> , we can make a <unk> ?
A <unk> is just a piece of <unk> <unk> .
The speed that we 're able to <unk> life is <unk> to <unk> <unk> .
Our ability to write the <unk> code , rather <unk> , but it 's <unk> .
And our <unk> <unk> the <unk> on a <unk> <unk> .
We 've got more than 15 years ago .
The process has <unk> a lot of <unk> , <unk> with a <unk> <unk> before we <unk> the first experiments .
But we found that we <unk> is very hard .
There are thousands of machines in the world that <unk> little <unk> , <unk> of DNA <unk> , <unk> of 30 <unk> and it 's a process : the <unk> is the <unk> , the <unk> is the <unk> , the <unk> is the <unk> , there 's .
So we had to develop a new way to <unk> these <unk> and <unk> the <unk> .
And this was our first <unk> , <unk> , from the digital information of <unk> <unk> <unk> .
It 's a little <unk> that we can see .
We designed the <unk> , <unk> the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> a <unk> of DNA <unk> <unk> .
The interesting part is when we took this piece of <unk> material and we <unk> it in bacteria , and we <unk> it in bacteria , the bacteria have <unk> to read this code and <unk> particles .
<unk> particles are <unk> by <unk> from cells , they 're <unk> back and have <unk> <unk> .
I talked about recently with a <unk> <unk> <unk> that they have of course , this model .
They have more than you .
And what this is a situation where the software can actually build his same <unk> in a <unk> system .
But I <unk> things to do the largest things in the big .
<unk> building the entire <unk> .
They 're more <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
So we thought about <unk> in the size of the <unk> , so we can change the <unk> to understand what the <unk> are the <unk> of a <unk> cell .
<unk> is <unk> , and if we <unk> information in a computer , these must be very <unk> .
When I <unk> this genome for the first time in <unk> the <unk> was of a <unk> for a <unk> <unk> .
We found , <unk> , 30 <unk> . If we used that original sequence that <unk> never <unk> in order to do it work .
A process is a part of the process is to design <unk> <unk> with all other <unk> <unk> to build more little <unk> than <unk> together .
<unk> elements here .
You probably read that that <unk> us <unk> .
So , we have a <unk> <unk> on four <unk> : <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> of those <unk> <unk> together together <unk> about 20 <unk> , and there 's a <unk> order to <unk> every <unk> .
So we can use the <unk> code to write , <unk> , <unk> .
What we did at the beginning was <unk> .
Some of them were <unk> by the fact that it didn 't <unk> .
So we designed this <unk> to <unk> <unk> .
There are <unk> that <unk> them and <unk> them .
And we started <unk> <unk> <unk> . <unk> with <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
But in every step of this <unk> in <unk> so that we 're <unk> to create a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> as you see in a minute .
We 're trying to <unk> the process .
So this seems the <unk> of a <unk> <unk> .
When I started these <unk> <unk> , a lot of 100 <unk> <unk> , <unk> , not <unk> directly to the <unk> <unk> .
It 's <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> biology .
So we have <unk> other <unk> .
<unk> of another <unk> called <unk> <unk> , which in biology <unk> to <unk> DNA <unk> <unk> .
So , here 's an example .
This <unk> , called <unk> <unk> , it can <unk> three million <unk> of <unk> .
You can see in the <unk> <unk> as his <unk> is <unk> .
<unk> -- 24 hours is <unk> exactly as it was before .
<unk> thousands of organisms that are able to do that .
These organisms can <unk> completely <unk> .
It 's going to live under <unk> .
They 're absolutely sure that life <unk> in space , and <unk> to find new <unk> <unk> of water .
And it 's actually <unk> , NASA has showed that this is .
This is an image of the <unk> that we have built by using these <unk> , just using the <unk> with the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> them <unk> them .
This image was not <unk> with a <unk> <unk> , but with a <unk> <unk> .
It 's a <unk> so big <unk> that we can <unk> with a <unk> <unk> .
These are pictures that <unk> a period of about six seconds .
This is the <unk> that we 've done a little time ago .
They 're more than <unk> <unk> <unk> .
It 's the largest <unk> of a <unk> structure ever <unk> from man .
It 's got a <unk> <unk> to 300 million .
If you <unk> it with a <unk> 10 without <unk> , we 'll be <unk> pages to <unk> this code .
Now , how do we work ? How can we do we get ?
<unk> , by a virus is a <unk> game .
It 's a little more <unk> when you use of bacteria .
It 's more simple when it 's about <unk> cells as our : you can just <unk> the <unk> and <unk> another , which is that the <unk> process .
In <unk> <unk> , the <unk> is instead of <unk> in the cell , but we have <unk> <unk> that we are able to do a <unk> <unk> of a cell to another and <unk> .
We <unk> a <unk> <unk> from a <unk> .
<unk> are different as men from <unk> .
We 've <unk> a few <unk> in the more way , we can decide what to have to be to <unk> this <unk> .
And then he <unk> with the <unk> <unk> all of <unk> .
And when we put it in the cell was <unk> and <unk> our <unk> <unk> the new <unk> <unk> is gone into the cell .
And <unk> <unk> that we didn 't go beyond , but we tried to <unk> them in there .
This is one of the <unk> of evolution .
We found that <unk> species have <unk> a second or a third <unk> from a few part , <unk> in a second thousands of new <unk> to the species .
So who think about evolution as a <unk> at the time you <unk> didn 't have a lot of biology .
<unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> that was in the cell didn 't <unk> one .
<unk> <unk> <unk> that we have <unk> .
It 's <unk> , and he <unk> the other <unk> as <unk> , <unk> it has <unk> , and we <unk> with only the cell and the new <unk> .
It 's become blue because of the genes we have <unk> .
And in a short <unk> of time , all the <unk> of a species are <unk> , and it 's <unk> of all in a new species , <unk> on the new software that we <unk> in the cell .
All the <unk> are <unk> , the <unk> are <unk> , and when <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> exactly to what we have <unk> .
Now , this may be <unk> <unk> , but we <unk> the software , we can change things in a way .
Now , I 've already <unk> that here is not about <unk> -- but it 's progress to start from three million years and a half years and a half years , and I 've already told that maybe we 're going to create a new <unk> of <unk> <unk> in this process .
Why do that ?
I think it 's enough to <unk> when we think about our <unk> .
We 're going to go from six billion and a half billion people in the next 40 years .
Just to give a example : I was born in <unk> .
Now there are three people on the planet to <unk> in <unk> ; in 40 years , there 's going to be four .
We 're <unk> problems now to find food , <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> to six billion people .
<unk> more <unk> to do it for nine billion .
<unk> more than five billion <unk> , more than 30 billion billion <unk> .
That means percent of <unk> a day .
When we 're trying to find <unk> <unk> , or any kind of process to <unk> , it 's going to be a huge challenge .
In more we have to realize all the <unk> of CO2 CO2 from these materials that <unk> in the atmosphere .
And so , I 'm going to talk about <unk> <unk> in the world , we have a <unk> with about 20 million genes , and I love to think that are the <unk> <unk> for the future .
<unk> industry only a <unk> about <unk> , and think about how many different things are <unk> out .
Our <unk> here are data from reality from the <unk> and our imagination .
Now we have <unk> , thank you to these <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> , able to create what we call <unk> <unk> .
We 're able to build a big robot that can produce a million <unk> a day .
Think about <unk> these 20 million genes or try to try to <unk> <unk> or <unk> , new <unk> , new <unk> , new <unk> , we can change , with a little team , and create more biology now that in the last 20 years of science .
And it 's just a <unk> <unk> .
We can choose to <unk> <unk> , chemistry or <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
This is a <unk> of some software <unk> that we 're working to be able to be able to <unk> and we 're going to be able to <unk> and we 're going to be able to design and we 're going to be able to design and we 're species to the computer .
Well , we don 't know how to be .
We know exactly what their <unk> code .
Now we 're <unk> on the <unk> generation of <unk> generation .
You 've seen you who <unk> <unk> from <unk> was a bad experiment .
We 've <unk> <unk> <unk> enough and third generation that we had enough to <unk> <unk> <unk> of the <unk> or different kinds of <unk> .
But the only way that biology can have a big impact without <unk> the cost of food and <unk> the cost of food and <unk> the <unk> would be <unk> CO2 in matter before , and we 're working to design cells that is going to be able to get this <unk> to the <unk> of <unk> in 18 months .
<unk> light <unk> with CO2 is a <unk> , but in our <unk> in all the world , we found different <unk> .
This is a <unk> that we have <unk> in <unk> .
It 's <unk> in the ocean , at about <unk> feet of <unk> water .
<unk> <unk> from CO2 using hydrogen <unk> as <unk> .
We 're trying to figure out if we can <unk> the CO2 , which can easily be <unk> by <unk> , <unk> that CO2 in <unk> , to drive this process .
So , I think I would be able to <unk> what the question is , " which is the <unk> of the <unk> that 's life . " And we have the <unk> goal of <unk> the entire <unk> industry .
<unk> . If you can 't do that from TED , where you can 't do that TED , where you can 't do that from TED ,
It 's a <unk> source of energy .
And it 's also , we 're working for the same <unk> to create <unk> .
You saw this year with the flu , we 're always back to a year and with a dollar in less when it 's about finding the right <unk> .
I think that 's going to change building <unk> in <unk> .
So here 's how much the future could start to look at the <unk> , now , the tree , <unk> evolution with bacteria <unk> , <unk> , and finally <unk> cells .
We 're in so much from <unk> people .
Our goal is to do in a way of living enough to try to try to try to try to <unk> <unk> . Thank you very much .
First of all I 'll show you , the <unk> as possible , some <unk> work , a <unk> of the new technology that we have taken at <unk> to a <unk> <unk> almost a year ago . This is <unk> .
It 's a <unk> in which you can <unk> is to the local level that <unk> with a huge amount of data .
And here we 're seeing <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> with a <unk> <unk> and <unk> , for a <unk> <unk> , <unk> the images as we want .
And it doesn 't matter how big the amount of information that we see , how big these <unk> are big <unk> of data or the images .
Most of the <unk> pictures , but this is a <unk> <unk> from the <unk> <unk> , and <unk> in the <unk> of 300 <unk> .
It doesn 't make any difference because the only thing that <unk> the <unk> of a system like this is the number of <unk> on your screen in any time . It 's also a lot of <unk> .
This is a whole book , example of data is not images .
This is <unk> <unk> <unk> . Every <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And so it 's just about <unk> and not <unk> , we can do a kind of like that , to see that 's a real <unk> of the <unk> , not a real <unk> of a picture .
It could be a little bit <unk> to read a <unk> book .
I don 't <unk> it .
This is a <unk> example . It 's a <unk> number of the <unk> .
Every image is the beginning of a <unk> .
And it 's really a <unk> , and the <unk> experience of a <unk> or a <unk> , which is for nature of a <unk> , which is for nature .
We also have done something with the corner of this particular number of this particular <unk> .
We created a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> of the <unk> in a normal <unk> and we have <unk> of the content .
If you want to see the <unk> of this <unk> , you can see here .
Or other models , or even <unk> <unk> .
And this really <unk> some of these ideas to <unk> the <unk> of space on the screen .
And I thought this <unk> to put in the <unk> and other <unk> , <unk> , not to be <unk> .
Of course , the <unk> is one of the most <unk> for this kind of technology .
And on this is not going to lose time , if we don 't say we have <unk> <unk> to give us to get in this field .
These are all the <unk> in the United States <unk> over a <unk> image .
So now I started to something else .
This is actually actually in the web ; you can see it .
It 's a project called <unk> , which <unk> two different technologies .
One is <unk> and the other is a <unk> <unk> to the computer a very interesting <unk> <unk> , a <unk> student of Washington , with the help of the <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . <unk> . <unk> . <unk> . <unk> . <unk> . <unk> .
And it 's in the web , <unk> by <unk> .
You can see when we do this kind of <unk> , where we can go from one image to another and have this kind of experience .
But the <unk> <unk> of the images here has actually a meaning .
And the <unk> of <unk> computers have <unk> these <unk> , so that <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> in which <unk> <unk> <unk> in which <unk> <unk> <unk> on the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> on the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and these things are all <unk> <unk> , and these things are all <unk> of <unk> <unk> , and these things are all <unk> <unk> .
I don 't know if I have time to show you some other environment .
There are much more <unk> .
I want to go to one of the <unk> of <unk> and this <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> and this <unk> <unk> that we have done work for the first time the next summer to show you that 's really the key behind this technology , the <unk> technology . And it 's not <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that we have to have <unk> <unk> in the website .
We had to <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
This is a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> and <unk> images of <unk> in <unk> , other <unk> and <unk> and <unk> . And by saying , you 're going to <unk> this model is a image that 's going to be <unk> to this model .
So I 'm all <unk> <unk> from <unk> and <unk> and they 're all <unk> at the <unk> level in this way .
And it 's possible to this <unk> way .
You know , I would never thought about to end up to work to <unk> .
It 's very <unk> <unk> this kind of <unk> here .
I think I 'm going to see that 's about a lot of different <unk> : from the <unk> <unk> , a number of <unk> , <unk> number of <unk> , <unk> , <unk> together in this environment .
And if I can , I can try and look at the <unk> .
A lot of them from <unk> , etc .
And here 's a <unk> of pictures -- <unk> .
This is a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
We can go from <unk> to physics of this environment .
The <unk> is that we can do things with the social environment . This is <unk> data from the entire memory memory of how we can <unk> the <unk> and <unk> all of this data together .
All of the pictures become <unk> together , more than the <unk> .
You have a <unk> model of the entire earth .
Think about this as a <unk> of the <unk> <unk> on the Earth <unk> .
It 's something that <unk> in <unk> complexity as people <unk> , and the <unk> that <unk> to the use of the use of the use of <unk> .
Their pictures are <unk> with <unk> <unk> from other people .
If someone 's been the idea of <unk> all these <unk> <unk> the name , my <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to <unk> in space , using the picture of anyone , and <unk> and <unk> .
Of course , a <unk> of all interesting , are <unk> <unk> of all interesting <unk> of the Earth , <unk> not only from <unk> <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> .
Thank you very much .
CA : I realized that your software is that your software <unk> us to do is that at a certain point , in the next years , all the pictures <unk> from anyone in the entire world are <unk> together ?
<unk> : Yeah . What 's doing in fact , is <unk> .
He 's creating <unk> , if you want , between images .
And it 's doing it in the <unk> of the images .
And what becomes very interesting if you think about <unk> information that many of the <unk> .
As a <unk> <unk> on the web , you <unk> a <unk> and the <unk> on the web has a lot of information about the images .
Now , what happens if that picture is you get to all your picture ?
So , the amount of <unk> <unk> and the <unk> of <unk> that 's really huge . It 's a <unk> effect . It 's a <unk> effect of the network .
CA : <unk> , it 's really amazing .
<unk> : I 'm going to tell you very much .
One of the major <unk> when you <unk> and one of the <unk> <unk> is the <unk> that we can live in the <unk> <unk> , between who <unk> the past wind , the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
You think that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , or that the <unk> <unk> <unk> are still <unk> <unk> of <unk> , or that <unk> <unk> , or that in <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , to <unk> the <unk> <unk> , and that the idea that the world in which we live in in which is not just a sense , but it 's a <unk> of a <unk> , but it 's a <unk> of a <unk> ,
And a <unk> of a particular <unk> of <unk> choices that our <unk> has done , well , a lot of <unk> .
And of course , all of the <unk> <unk> .
All of all of <unk> .
We 're <unk> to <unk> <unk> .
We have to deal with the death <unk> , so we didn 't have to <unk> and <unk> --
We all have a art .
What 's <unk> is the <unk> of the song , the <unk> of the <unk> of every culture .
It 's not matter that are the <unk> of the <unk> , or the <unk> of <unk> <unk> , or the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , or a <unk> in the heart of the <unk> .
He was my <unk> of the journey in <unk> a month ago , or a <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> , on <unk> , the <unk> mother 's <unk> .
All of these <unk> <unk> us that there are other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , other ways of the world .
And if you <unk> a second , it 's a concept that 's a way that 's going to give you hope .
<unk> , the <unk> of <unk> <unk> of the world create a <unk> life and <unk> that <unk> the planet and is important for the <unk> of the planet as <unk> <unk> .
And you can think about this <unk> <unk> as a <unk> and you can <unk> the <unk> the <unk> of all the <unk> , <unk> , dreams , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> in the human imagination .
<unk> is the <unk> of humanity .
It 's the <unk> of what we are and what we can be in how species .
And <unk> the <unk> was <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> , for example , <unk> that 50 percent of all the species is about <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> , because it 's <unk> , or -- in the <unk> <unk> , in the <unk> of diversity -- and you don 't even even even <unk> to the <unk> <unk> -- and you don 't even even even even even <unk> than the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> diversity .
<unk> of all that is , of course , the <unk> <unk> .
When you 're <unk> <unk> <unk> on this planet .
A language is not only <unk> by a <unk> or a series of rules .
A language is the <unk> of the human spirit .
It 's the middle of which the <unk> of every culture comes in the world .
Every language language is a forest of the mind , a <unk> , a <unk> <unk> ,
And those <unk> <unk> <unk> , as we 're here in <unk> , at least half the <unk> is no longer <unk> in the <unk> of the kids .
They don 't get to children , which means , <unk> that 's not <unk> something , which is already death .
What 's more <unk> of being <unk> by <unk> , of being the last last to be the last few to talk about a language , of the <unk> of <unk> <unk> or <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> or <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> or <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> ,
This <unk> <unk> was a <unk> of someone in the world every two weeks , every two weeks , a <unk> <unk> and door with it in the <unk> <unk> of a <unk> language .
And I know that somebody of you know , " <unk> 't it better ?
The world doesn 't have a better place if we all have the same language ? " <unk> , then we 're talking about <unk> .
<unk> <unk> .
<unk> of a <unk> thing , it 's not able to talk to his language .
I 'd like to give you a journey through the <unk> --
a little journey in <unk> to give you a <unk> of what we 're <unk> .
A lot of us <unk> that when I 'm saying , " I mean , " I mean , very different ways of <unk> .
<unk> for example , this <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , the <unk> of <unk> , which <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
It 's a <unk> that 's not able to <unk> the blue color from the green because the time <unk> is <unk> in the <unk> of the forest , which <unk> the <unk> .
They have a <unk> language and a <unk> rule , <unk> <unk> , " <unk> <unk> " : you have to <unk> a different language .
All of this has <unk> in the past <unk> , but the <unk> is that in these <unk> families , where they talk six or seven <unk> to the <unk> <unk> .
It 's going to listen and then <unk> to talk .
<unk> one of the most interesting <unk> with the <unk> <unk> , a <unk> <unk> <unk> , a <unk> <unk> <unk> , a <unk> <unk> that had the first <unk> in <unk> .
In <unk> , five <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> .
They did <unk> from the top of the <unk> that <unk> them in <unk> that <unk> <unk> , <unk> that this <unk> <unk> forest <unk> had never seen anything <unk> .
They <unk> the pictures from the earth , they <unk> to the research a form or a <unk> and <unk> , not <unk> , nothing , they <unk> that <unk> <unk> , and they <unk> the five <unk> with <unk> .
But <unk> didn 't just <unk> .
It 's <unk> between them .
<unk> percent of <unk> <unk> was <unk> by their own .
We 're <unk> to eight <unk> and we found two of death and we 've got <unk> to know , they <unk> that one of them was so <unk> that he died , and then they <unk> it was so <unk> , and then they <unk> it <unk> it . And then they <unk> it was <unk> that one of the <unk> .
<unk> were able to recognize the animal <unk> from 40 <unk> and <unk> the species .
<unk> , first ' <unk> , I was <unk> a very interesting job when my <unk> <unk> <unk> me if I wanted to go to <unk> <unk> between society <unk> to <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to make the <unk> .
For a sense of <unk> , I had to understand culture and that the <unk> is not <unk> <unk> .
It 's pretty much about a <unk> <unk> <unk> of the world .
<unk> .
If you <unk> to <unk> the big <unk> of the world , what would you get ?
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , etc .
A continent <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . And then , thinking about Africa has no <unk> <unk> . And instead and the <unk> is not another that the <unk> of these <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> .
What makes the <unk> is interesting is the <unk> between life and death .
So the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> can be <unk> by <unk> <unk> , <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> and <unk> <unk> to the <unk> in the way that for a short second , it becomes the <unk> .
So , the <unk> <unk> to say , " <unk> <unk> you go to talk about God .
We <unk> in <unk> and <unk> God . "
And from the moment you 're <unk> , is the spirit that <unk> you , how can you get you to get a little bit ?
So , it 's <unk> to these amazing events : <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And I 've lived with the most <unk> <unk> are the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , in the <unk> .
<unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
In a <unk> continent , this <unk> has never been <unk> by <unk> .
<unk> today are <unk> by a <unk> , but their <unk> is <unk> .
<unk> <unk> are <unk> from the families to three or four , and live <unk> in a world <unk> and <unk> in a world <unk> and <unk> in <unk> <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> for 18 years .
Two <unk> of nine years <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of the mother , now are <unk> in the <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
For all this time , they 're <unk> to values , values that <unk> that <unk> their <unk> and only their <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> -- or to say the <unk> <unk> .
At the <unk> of this incredible <unk> , they 're <unk> out and for the first time in their life , at the age of 18 , see a <unk> . And in that <unk> <unk> <unk> , when the sun <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> , all that we have been <unk> in the <unk> <unk> , all that 's going to learn in the <unk> <unk> , and he <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> , he <unk> <unk> <unk> , and he says ,
" <unk> ? I said ,
It 's <unk> . Now it 's going to you . "
They call <unk> <unk> and they say that we , <unk> <unk> , we are the <unk> of the world .
This level of <unk> is extremely important .
When we think about <unk> and <unk> <unk> and the old story of <unk> <unk> , which is a <unk> concept in his <unk> or maybe <unk> <unk> <unk> and say that these <unk> are more <unk> to Earth than us .
<unk> <unk> are not <unk> <unk> by <unk> .
There 's no space for these things in the <unk> of <unk> or <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , but because of time and <unk> , have <unk> a <unk> of the Earth <unk> <unk> , and <unk> on a <unk> <unk> , but on a <unk> <unk> <unk> , the concept that the Earth can live because it 's from the <unk> of the <unk> .
What does it mean ?
It 's going to say that a <unk> of the <unk> that the mountain is a <unk> that <unk> his <unk> is going to be different <unk> and will have a <unk> <unk> <unk> and it 's going to be a different <unk> of the <unk> that <unk> a mountain is a <unk> <unk> that a <unk> <unk> that a mountain is a <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> .
That 's the <unk> of one spirit or a <unk> <unk> is <unk> .
What 's interesting is is the <unk> that <unk> the relationship between the <unk> and the natural world .
I grew up in the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to be <unk> .
And that <unk> me a different human being different from my friends who believe that <unk> are the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> that live in the <unk> <unk> , which <unk> <unk> in the <unk> .
If you start <unk> that these <unk> can create very different , we could start to understand some of them <unk> <unk> . <unk> this <unk> .
I <unk> this picture at <unk> in <unk> <unk> .
Maybe some of you have heard about the <unk> , the most powerful <unk> <unk> <unk> .
What makes the <unk> is not the potential <unk> , but his <unk> . It 's <unk> from two things .
<unk> one side , this <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> , <unk> and <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
<unk> the only <unk> <unk> <unk> a little <unk> that <unk> a little bit , but it 's <unk> with the <unk> of a <unk> <unk> of the family <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
This <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , very similar to <unk> , <unk> .
If you 'll see the <unk> <unk> on the <unk> <unk> on the <unk> that do from a different <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
<unk> that <unk> on the <unk> is a little bit like being <unk> by a <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> on a sea <unk> of electricity . <unk> 't create a <unk> of electricity . It doesn 't make a <unk> of reality .
And I often had to my <unk> , Richard <unk> <unk> , the man who <unk> the <unk> was <unk> , with his discovery of <unk> in the <unk> .
And my <unk> , you can 't <unk> these <unk> as <unk> because if you 're <unk> you can 't tell nobody of being <unk> . <unk> . <unk> 't be <unk> because they 're <unk> by a <unk> that 's <unk> in the <unk> , of course , <unk> <unk> .
It 's possible to <unk> only if you <unk> with other <unk> <unk> that <unk> .
Now , the <unk> is the <unk> that are in this <unk> are <unk> of the <unk> , the same kind of <unk> for <unk> . The question <unk> <unk> : in a <unk> of <unk> species of plants , how do these <unk> <unk> <unk> . <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
We use the big <unk> of <unk> and <unk> , which can <unk> <unk> .
But if we <unk> , we <unk> , " <unk> us " <unk> " <unk> . "
What does it mean ?
This <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , which <unk> <unk> in the forest , and that our eyes in the same species .
If you <unk> their <unk> , they <unk> us , " <unk> <unk> , " <unk> <unk> of plants , the rest of the rest of them ? " I said , " No . "
The solution is , they take the <unk> <unk> in a <unk> <unk> <unk> with a different <unk> .
And you don 't have to <unk> <unk> , but it 's much more interesting than <unk> <unk> .
Now , [ [ <unk> ] the problem is that the ones that have to <unk> the <unk> <unk> them , but in some way we <unk> to our <unk> of history , and <unk> <unk> .
In fact , the <unk> century , <unk> , not <unk> <unk> for his <unk> or its <unk> <unk> <unk> , but rather as the was where we <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , but rather as the <unk> of diversity and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> the mass of diversity and <unk> and <unk> <unk> of the planet . Now the problem is not the change .
All the <unk> through the <unk> have been <unk> in a <unk> for new possibilities .
And the problem is not technology .
<unk> <unk> have no <unk> of being <unk> when they put <unk> and <unk> as the <unk> have <unk> and <unk> as the <unk> didn 't have <unk> to be <unk> when they put <unk> and <unk> .
It 's not the change or technology that <unk> the <unk> of <unk> . It 's the power .
<unk> <unk> <unk> .
And if you <unk> a look at the world , you know that these are not <unk> <unk> to <unk> .
They 're <unk> and <unk> <unk> out of the existence of <unk> forces that go beyond their <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of <unk> --
a <unk> <unk> <unk> , in <unk> <unk> , a <unk> that has been <unk> in the forest to a generation , and now <unk> to the <unk> and <unk> on the <unk> of the <unk> , where you can see the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> from the <unk> <unk> <unk> , which <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , where the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , where the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> ,
It 's going to <unk> the <unk> with the <unk> to the forest .
Or , in the case of <unk> , are the disease that are <unk> with the <unk> discovery .
If you <unk> on the <unk> of the <unk> , where I 'm doing a lot of research , you 'll see the <unk> <unk> of the political <unk> .
As <unk> the <unk> , the physics of a <unk> , is <unk> <unk> at the <unk> , but the <unk> of the <unk> of life of a <unk> , not only is <unk> , but <unk> <unk> in certain <unk> , because it 's a part of <unk> .
And you can 't understand the <unk> of the <unk> until the beginning .
I <unk> the <unk> miles from <unk> in the <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> to <unk> with a young <unk> , but only got to <unk> with a young <unk> , but only got to <unk> that <unk> the <unk> that we could talk .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> million people <unk> from <unk> in the <unk> .
The father of this guy was <unk> to <unk> .
which means that it 's been <unk> to the <unk> of Chinese <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> in the <unk> that <unk> <unk> .
My mother was <unk> and his <unk> was to be <unk> .
It was brought to <unk> in <unk> at the age of two years <unk> <unk> his <unk> because he didn 't have to live without him .
<unk> , which did the same , was <unk> in <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> a <unk> <unk> and , for this <unk> , was <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> for seven years .
The pain of <unk> can be <unk> , but the spirit <unk> of <unk> is from <unk> <unk> .
And finally , all <unk> to a choice .
<unk> live in the world of <unk> or we want to <unk> the world of diversity ?
The big <unk> <unk> <unk> , before he said that his greatest <unk> was that , in our <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of the world , not only <unk> the whole <unk> of the world , not only <unk> the whole <unk> of the human imagination , and a day we <unk> <unk> <unk> that there were other possibilities .
And it 's <unk> to remember that our species is <unk> for <unk> years .
<unk> <unk> , which has given us to us , which has been <unk> us to <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> with the <unk> of the <unk> with the <unk> of <unk> , creating <unk> <unk> <unk> , and we talk about <unk> years ago .
The <unk> world has been <unk> 300 years .
And that <unk> story didn 't tell me that we have the answers to all the challenges that we have to <unk> in <unk> .
When these <unk> <unk> <unk> of the world is asked what it means to be human , <unk> with <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And it 's in these answers that we all <unk> the possibility of being what we are : a kind of <unk> , which has to make that all the <unk> and all the <unk> can <unk> . And there 's a lot of <unk> .
I <unk> this picture on the <unk> <unk> of the island of <unk> , when I went to <unk> <unk> with <unk> , and this man , <unk> me to <unk> the wonderful story of his <unk> .
The government <unk> was not always <unk> with the <unk> and <unk> in the <unk> and in the <unk> <unk> , we <unk> them in <unk> .
<unk> of this man <unk> <unk> .
<unk> , <unk> for his life , <unk> , <unk> all of the <unk> , and all his <unk> .
You know that <unk> don 't <unk> the cold , <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> were made of <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> of this man didn 't <unk> from night or <unk> .
And it 's <unk> , it 's <unk> the <unk> in the skin of <unk> and <unk> in your hand . When I did <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
He <unk> <unk> on the <unk> of this <unk> of <unk> and when <unk> <unk> , he <unk> a dog .
He <unk> the dog and created a <unk> , with the <unk> <unk> has created a <unk> , he <unk> a <unk> , and it 's <unk> on the <unk> , <unk> <unk> in <unk> .
<unk> to talk about <unk> with nothing ? [ [ <unk> ] And this , in different ways , [ <unk> ] is the <unk> of <unk> <unk> and all the <unk> <unk> of the world .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of a <unk> area of <unk> and <unk> together .
It 's their new <unk> . It 's called <unk> . It 's called <unk> .
It 's a <unk> <unk> . <unk> all the <unk> resources .
One <unk> example of how a <unk> can <unk> with his <unk> .
And , to end , I think it 's pretty <unk> at least at the people who 's been in these <unk> <unk> <unk> that are not <unk> at all .
For someone 's home .
<unk> <unk> of the human imagination that <unk> to <unk> to <unk> . And for us all , the dreams of these kids , as the dreams of our children , they 're <unk> <unk> of hope .
So , we <unk> <unk> <unk> , we are <unk> that <unk> never <unk> to nothing .
<unk> that <unk> --
[ <unk> ] [ <unk> ] [ <unk> ] [ <unk> ] [ [ <unk> ] ] [ [ <unk> ] ] ] [ <unk> ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] [ <unk> ] ] ] ] ] [ <unk> ] ]
<unk> <unk> : <unk> our <unk> <unk> .
Our <unk> are <unk> from millions of people .
Our work is <unk> in <unk> to bring our audience in <unk> to bring our audience in <unk> <unk> <unk> from which <unk> <unk> from how they saw and , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , the world 's <unk> in <unk> in diversity , and we need to find a <unk> of life in a world and we need to find a <unk> <unk> <unk> in a world and <unk> .
where the <unk> of all <unk> can <unk> to our <unk> <unk> .
Thank you .
I 'm going to talk about some of the things I 've written in this book that I hope you 've heard and <unk> to <unk> some <unk> , in the case you don 't <unk> them .
I want to start with what I call " the <unk> <unk> . "
<unk> <unk> of what ?
<unk> <unk> of all the <unk> society <unk> <unk> . The <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> : " If we want to <unk> the <unk> of our citizens , " The way to do it is <unk> . "
The reason is , from one side , in fact that the freedom is in itself a value , is <unk> , useful , <unk> for human beings .
And the other is that if we are <unk> , each of us can do it to do that that we 're going to do all that we 're going to be our <unk> .
The way to <unk> the freedom is to <unk> .
<unk> people have , more <unk> , and more is their freedom , and the freedom , the <unk> is their <unk> .
This , <unk> , it 's so <unk> in the society that nobody <unk> <unk> in <unk> .
And it 's also <unk> <unk> in our lives .
I 'm going to show you a few examples of what progress is possible .
This is my <unk> . It 's not particularly big .
I <unk> a simple <unk> on the <unk> to <unk> .
In my <unk> , there are <unk> <unk> , without <unk> the 10 <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> that you can buy for a huge number of <unk> in the <unk> <unk> that nobody of the <unk> <unk> is <unk> .
So , here 's what the <unk> .
And then you go to the <unk> <unk> to <unk> : <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
And in this single <unk> <unk> , there 's a big number of <unk> <unk> .
We can do six million and a <unk> of different <unk> using the <unk> that there are in one .
<unk> <unk> that there 's <unk> .
<unk> <unk> : the world 's <unk> .
Once , when I was a child , you could get all the services <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> that were <unk> by <unk> .
It 's <unk> the phone , you don 't get it .
A <unk> of that , one of that , was that the phone never <unk> .
These days are gone .
Now , we have a <unk> <unk> of <unk> , especially between the phones .
So , here 's the <unk> .
My <unk> is that in a half , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> .
If you don 't have seen the <unk> in the <unk> , you 're very <unk> that 's <unk> .
And what 's going on is that people go into the <unk> and make this question . And you know , is the answer ? The answer is " No . "
It 's not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn 't face things .
So , in other <unk> of life that are much more important than <unk> , <unk> the same <unk> of choices .
<unk> <unk> : It 's not going on in the United States you 're <unk> from <unk> and the <unk> you have to do .
Instead , <unk> from <unk> , and the <unk> says , " OK , we can do it , or <unk> " <unk> , " <unk> , " <unk> , " <unk> , " <unk> these <unk> <unk> , " <unk> these <unk> these <unk> , " <unk> , " <unk> , " <unk> , we could we do ? "
You <unk> : " <unk> , what do ? "
And the <unk> says , " <unk> has these <unk> and these <unk> , and <unk> has these <unk> and these <unk> . "
" What do you want to do ? "
And you said , " <unk> if she was me , what would you say ? "
And the <unk> , " But I 'm not going to her . "
The result we call it " <unk> <unk> , " <unk> that makes it a beautiful thing .
But actually , it 's not that one <unk> the weight and responsibility to take decisions from someone who knows something , <unk> the <unk> , <unk> the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> is <unk> -- and it 's certainly <unk> -- and it 's not <unk> to take decisions .
There 's a huge <unk> of <unk> products , <unk> to people like me and you , which if you think about it doesn 't have any sense , because we can 't <unk> .
But if we can 't <unk> , why ?
The answer is that they want to <unk> , we call the <unk> <unk> .
And so fundamental as a <unk> is our <unk> , is a question of choice , as you see in this <unk> , " We don 't want to <unk> the kids . <unk> their sex at the right time . " You don 't have to <unk> a <unk> : we have to <unk> .
And we can <unk> how many times we <unk> .
And that means that every <unk> , you have to <unk> , you have to <unk> that kind of person you want to be .
<unk> to the family and <unk> , a <unk> perspective , almost <unk> to anyone , was that you <unk> the <unk> as possible , and you <unk> to get to the <unk> .
The only real choice was with who , not when , and even what to do after .
<unk> , all is really <unk> .
<unk> to students very smart , and they <unk> them , 20 percent <unk> in the time .
And they 're not <unk> , because they 're not <unk> .
But why they 're <unk> , <unk> to <unk> , " <unk> <unk> or not ? "
" <unk> <unk> <unk> later ? I have to think before ?
They 're <unk> .
And they try to answer these questions , even though this is not <unk> the <unk> that <unk> and not get a big <unk> to my <unk> .
And they really have to do it . They 're important questions .
Now , the work : we 're <unk> , as <unk> <unk> , because technology is going to be able to work every day , from every day , from every day , from the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , there 's a <unk> , and I 'm not going to say to nobody , where the <unk> works .
I don 't tell you , because I want to use it .
What does , this incredible <unk> of choice that we have about work ? Is it we have to decide , <unk> in every moment , if we have to work or not .
We can go to see our son to <unk> , with the cell phone , the <unk> in the other , and the <unk> , <unk> on the other , and the <unk> , <unk> .
And even though I 'm all <unk> , every minute that we see our son <unk> , we 're also <unk> , " I have to answer this called ? "
" I have to answer this <unk> ? I have to <unk> this letter ? "
And even when the answer is , " no , " all this makes the experience of your son very different from what it would be in other conditions .
So , from any part of all of them , little and big objects , and <unk> , life is a question of choices .
Once the world was this : <unk> , there were some possibilities , but it was a choice .
The world of today is <unk> to this : <unk> is , " Is it a <unk> , or <unk> ? "
The answer is <unk> .
<unk> <unk> them , we all know , so I 'm going to talk about the <unk> .
<unk> this choice <unk> two effects of the people .
The first , <unk> , is that it 's <unk> instead of <unk> .
And so many <unk> in which <unk> , becomes very hard to do .
So , I 'm going to give you a <unk> <unk> .
A <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , with <unk> <unk> , with about a million <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> , with about a million <unk> in <unk> <unk> .
What she found out of that she found is that for every 10 solutions that are <unk> in the most , the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> 50 <unk> <unk> , there 's 10 percent in less than <unk> when they 're available are available only five . Why ?
Because with 50 <unk> in which <unk> , is <unk> hard to decide , and the choice is <unk> to <unk> .
And in <unk> , and still <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and of course , <unk> <unk> comes to .
<unk> that doesn 't mean that this is not just that these <unk> <unk> food to <unk> because they don 't want to say that the decision is so <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of work .
They 're not <unk> , they 're <unk> to five <unk> <unk> for the year from <unk> <unk> , which is <unk> <unk> .
So the <unk> is a <unk> of <unk> choices .
And I think we <unk> the world .
" And to end , for the <unk> : <unk> , <unk> or <unk> ? "
You 're going to take the right decision , if it 's the <unk> , right ?
You don 't want to choose the wrong , and you <unk> the wrong <unk> .
So this is the first effect . The second is that even though we can <unk> <unk> the <unk> and make a choice , at the end , we 're less <unk> by <unk> in which you have to <unk> the <unk> of which <unk> .
And this for different reasons .
One of those is that with many <unk> in which <unk> , if you <unk> one and it 's not easy , it 's not easy to imagine that it 's going to be better . And what happens is that the <unk> <unk> <unk> us to <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> from the <unk> decision , and the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> from the decision ,
And even when it was a <unk> decision .
<unk> , there are , more , it 's easy to <unk> than <unk> .
And it 's also , there 's what the <unk> call <unk> .
Dan <unk> has <unk> very well as well as the value that we have to <unk> things from what <unk> <unk> .
<unk> , when there are many <unk> , it 's easy to <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and be less <unk> of the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
So here 's an example . I <unk> with all the ones that are New York .
But that 's probably <unk> .
There 's this <unk> to <unk> .
A <unk> place .
<unk> <unk> . <unk> day . It 's all about them .
It 's not <unk> . But what he thinks is , " Well , <unk> , it 's <unk> . "
" All my <unk> are <unk> . "
" <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . "
And it 's two weeks from the idea that 's <unk> -- every day -- the <unk> of <unk> where it wants .
The <unk> <unk> the <unk> for that we have , even when the choice was <unk> .
And the most <unk> we have from <unk> , the <unk> <unk> us against how <unk> <unk> .
So here 's another example .
This <unk> tells us a lot of things .
It 's about the moment , and maybe in the <unk> .
But the most important point is that anything you 're going to , you 're going to be <unk> .
The things that didn 't <unk> have a lot of <unk> that can make less <unk> what we do .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> <unk> .
I tried to my skin <unk> a new <unk> .
It 's almost always <unk> .
Once the <unk> were a <unk> , and <unk> them and <unk> <unk> , were <unk> , only after <unk> <unk> , were <unk> , only after <unk> a lot of times , <unk> to go to well .
So , I went to <unk> a new <unk> when the <unk> were gone , and said , " I need a couple of <unk> , this is my <unk> . "
<unk> said , " <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> ? "
You want them to <unk> or <unk> ? " <unk> " <unk> ? "
" <unk> <unk> ? "
" <unk> <unk> them wants to <unk> or <unk> ? <unk> <unk> <unk> .
I was <unk> , and after a little bit , I was able to say , " I want the only guy that was -- which was the only guy , " he didn 't have any idea of what it was , so <unk> from the <unk> , and I was <unk> from the <unk> , and I was <unk> from the <unk> , <unk> , with the <unk> <unk> , I had ever <unk> .
It was the <unk> . With all that choice , I had to <unk> the better .
But I 'm going to be worse .
Why ? I wrote a whole book for <unk> .
The reason I was worse is that with all the choice my <unk> were <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> to be <unk> .
At the beginning I had <unk> . I didn 't <unk> me to <unk> me , when I just <unk> one guy , but when we <unk> 100 different , <unk> , at least a kind of like a perfect thing .
What I had <unk> was good , but not perfect .
After <unk> , I was <unk> to <unk> in <unk> .
<unk> <unk> in the life of people do not make the <unk> that these have <unk> <unk> that these have <unk> <unk> .
And this <unk> less <unk> , even when the results are good .
<unk> in the world of <unk> , if it 's realized .
Because if I <unk> it , I 'm not talking about what I 'm talking about .
The truth is more than this .
" <unk> was better when he was worse , " The reason he was better when he was worse is that when he was worse is , when it was still <unk> <unk> .
<unk> , in the world that we live -- <unk> , <unk> , <unk> that we can <unk> is that things are <unk> to the <unk> of <unk> .
You 've never <unk> to <unk> because your <unk> , my <unk> , you 're <unk> .
The <unk> of happiness -- what you 're here -- is , " <unk> <unk> " Yes , " Yeah , you want . "
I mean -- a little <unk> moment -- which is really <unk> and my wife is really <unk> .
I couldn 't do better , I didn 't have to be <unk> .
But <unk> is not always a <unk> thing .
<unk> , a <unk> of buy a couple of <unk> <unk> when there 's only that kind of <unk> is that when you 're not <unk> , and I 'm going to give you ? "
" Who is <unk> ? " <unk> is <unk> .
The world is the <unk> . What I could I do ?
When there are hundreds of kinds of <unk> , and you <unk> a <unk> , and you <unk> a <unk> , and you 'll give you who 's <unk> , it 's clear that the <unk> you are .
It could do better .
And by hundreds of <unk> available , there are no <unk> for the <unk> .
So when people get decisions , even though the <unk> is <unk> , they <unk> <unk> and <unk> their own <unk> .
In the last few years , the <unk> is <unk> in the world .
I think a <unk> <unk> -- not the only , but important -- of this <unk> <unk> is just that people have experiences because the <unk> are too <unk> .
And when they have to <unk> this situation think that the <unk> is them .
So the <unk> is that in general , we 're better , <unk> , but we 'll be <unk> .
And I 'm going to tell you .
This is the <unk> <unk> , what we 're going to do for good and it 's completely <unk> .
There 's no <unk> that a little bit of choice is better than not <unk> , but from this is not <unk> that much better than a lot of choice is better than a little bit .
There 's a <unk> value , <unk> . I don 't know what it 's .
But I 'm sure we have <unk> from a piece of the level where the choices <unk> our life .
Now , from the <unk> <unk> -- I got almost <unk> -- I got from a <unk> <unk> , the <unk> is the <unk> .
What it allows all this choice in the <unk> is the <unk> material .
There are a lot of places in the world , and you have <unk> <unk> , where the problem is not that have <unk> .
The problem is that they have too <unk> .
So the <unk> that I 'm talking about is a <unk> <unk> , <unk> society .
And what <unk> <unk> and <unk> is this : <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> you talked about yesterday of how those <unk> and <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> . It 's a <unk> of money .
I mean that these choices , <unk> and <unk> , it 's not that just are just <unk> .
They 're <unk> .
They 're going to be worse .
If a little bit about what we do in our society <unk> to <unk> choice was <unk> in those where people have too few , it 's not only their life to <unk> , but also our life .
This is what <unk> call a <unk> <unk> .
A <unk> of income is good for all -- not only the poor -- not only to the poor -- because of this choice in <unk> that we <unk> .
And to <unk> , " <unk> , you can become all you want to be --
<unk> , people , <unk> , <unk> , " But what do you know ? "
" It 's <unk> that you can 't get anything in a <unk> of glass . "
" A <unk> , a <unk> <unk> <unk> of the world --
and <unk> me , I got it so , at the beginning .
But then , <unk> , I realized that fish knows that fish knows that fish knows that fish knows that fish knows .
Because the reality of <unk> is that if you <unk> the <unk> , you know , " everything is possible . " You can 't <unk> the freedom . You can 't <unk> the freedom . You <unk> the <unk> .
If you <unk> the <unk> in a way that everything is possible to <unk> the <unk> .
<unk> the <unk> , and <unk> the <unk> .
All they need a <unk> .
This is almost certainly too <unk> , maybe for the fish , and it 's certainly for us .
But the <unk> of some <unk> <unk> is a <unk> for <unk> and <unk> , <unk> , for <unk> .
Thank you .
