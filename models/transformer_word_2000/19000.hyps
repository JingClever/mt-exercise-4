<unk> year I showed these <unk> for <unk> that the <unk> <unk> <unk> , which for almost three million years , has had the size of the United States <unk> , <unk> 40 percent .
I 'm going to <unk> the <unk> of the problem because it doesn 't show the ice <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> <unk> is , in a certain sense , the heart <unk> of climate change .
It 's <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
The next <unk> will be a <unk> <unk> on the <unk> of the last 25 years .
<unk> <unk> are <unk> in red .
And you see , it 's <unk> up to the blue <unk> .
That 's the ice in <unk> , which <unk> summer .
You can see that the <unk> ice <unk> , of five years or more , it 's like the blood , which here is from the body .
In 25 years , it 's been the way .
This is a problem because the <unk> <unk> <unk> around the ocean <unk> , where there are enormous <unk> of <unk> <unk> that , <unk> , are <unk> in <unk> by the <unk> .
<unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> of <unk> , that <unk> <unk> .
In some <unk> <unk> in <unk> , the <unk> is already <unk> by the water .
The <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> ! <unk> : You 're good . <unk> : You know .
One reason is that this <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> from the north .
This is a <unk> river in <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> had never <unk> <unk> as a <unk> .
This is the <unk> river , in the <unk> of <unk> .
If you want to know how the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> on <unk> , you 're going to be <unk> the sea level .
These <unk> are <unk> <unk> .
On the other hand , <unk> , the biggest <unk> ice on the planet .
<unk> <unk> , <unk> scientists who <unk> the ice <unk> is in <unk> , and that the Western <unk> , which <unk> on some <unk> , is particularly <unk> in <unk> .
<unk> at six feet of the <unk> , like <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , the third <unk> of ice , you see new <unk> , which a few years ago , were <unk> .
<unk> percent of the world 's population <unk> water from that <unk> .
<unk> <unk> : This is the <unk> water source of this city .
The <unk> is <unk> .
But when you <unk> , the same happens to the <unk> water .
In California , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> percent .
The <unk> <unk> are <unk> .
The <unk> , as you read , they 're <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> in the world <unk> to a <unk> increase in <unk> .
<unk> <unk> are <unk> to a <unk> out of the normal and <unk> .
<unk> times more <unk> in the last 30 years of <unk> <unk> .
This is a <unk> of all <unk> .
If you look at the <unk> context of this <unk> can see if you can see the <unk> .
In the last five years , we 've <unk> 70 million <unk> of CO2 every day .
<unk> the area of the <unk> <unk> , from the <unk> , to <unk> , and both parts of the <unk> <unk> , where there 's a <unk> <unk> of oxygen in the ocean .
The <unk> cause of global warming , together with <unk> , which is 20 percent , is the use of <unk> <unk> .
The oil is a problem , and <unk> is even worse .
The United States is one of the two countries with <unk> emissions , together to China .
And they 're going to build a lot of other <unk> .
But we 're starting to a <unk> of direction .
These are the <unk> projects over the last years and some <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
<unk> , there 's a <unk> policy in our country .
The <unk> of <unk> and oil <unk> have <unk> million dollars in the last year to <unk> <unk> <unk> , which is a <unk> .
I 'm going to <unk> something --
<unk> <unk> , where I live , there was a <unk> of <unk> billion <unk> of <unk> .
You may have seen it on the <unk> .
This is the second biggest flow of <unk> in America .
It 's happened around <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> of one of the <unk> <unk> was this .
<unk> : <unk> ♫ ♫ <unk> the <unk> is a <unk> and happy .
It 's <unk> here in America , and it makes our economy .
<unk> the <unk> is <unk> .
It 's <unk> , <unk> and <unk> <unk> it .
<unk> : <unk> here 's a lot of <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The largest <unk> society on the <unk> is <unk> <unk> . This is his <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> . <unk> <unk> , Al <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> -- they don 't know what they 're talking about .
<unk> : So the <unk> for the <unk> <unk> has <unk> two <unk> .
This is one of them , a part .
<unk> : <unk> : <unk> <unk> see the <unk> changes as a <unk> <unk> to our business .
And so we <unk> a huge amount of money in a <unk> <unk> to make public and <unk> the <unk> of <unk> .
In fact , <unk> is not <unk> .
We think it 's <unk> -- it also has a good <unk> .
So we 're not going to be <unk> about climate change .
We 're going to do .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> . <unk> : <unk> <unk> . You 've heard a lot .
So , I 'm going to <unk> a <unk> in a structure , as <unk> .
<unk> ! The machines are a little bit <unk> , but that 's the sound of the technology of <unk> .
<unk> <unk> is between the <unk> <unk> of global <unk> , but the <unk> technology that you see changes everything .
So , let 's look : this is the <unk> technology .
<unk> : <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> to the economic issue and national security .
<unk> : <unk> America is <unk> ; the <unk> , the national security , the national crisis .
The <unk> that <unk> all : our <unk> from the <unk> <unk> , like <unk> and oil <unk> .
Now , there 's a new , <unk> solution for <unk> .
<unk> America : 100 percent of energy , in a <unk> .
A plan for <unk> America to work , more <unk> , and helping <unk> global warming .
<unk> , a solution that we 're going to solve our problems .
<unk> America . <unk> more .
<unk> : This is the last one .
<unk> : <unk> : It 's about energy to America .
One of the most <unk> ways of <unk> to <unk> from the <unk> that <unk> our planet .
<unk> : The future is here . <unk> , <unk> , a new network <unk> .
<unk> <unk> 2 : <unk> <unk> for jobs .
<unk> : <unk> America . It 's time to be <unk> .
<unk> : A old <unk> <unk> says , " If you want to go from themselves .
If you want to go away , you go . "
We have to go away , quickly .
Thank you very much .
<unk> year at TED , I did a <unk> on <unk> .
And we try to <unk> about how the car works .
So here . And for the ones that the other time , there were no , the <unk> is the largest scientific experiment ever <unk> -- <unk> miles of <unk> .
<unk> is to <unk> the conditions that were in the <unk> that were in less than a <unk> of the <unk> of the universe -- until <unk> million times a second .
All of that is simply <unk> .
This is the car <unk> .
<unk> these <unk> <unk> in the <unk> .
This is what I work . It 's called <unk> -- it 's <unk> meters and has a <unk> <unk> .
This is a <unk> picture of <unk> in building so you can see the <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> last year we <unk> the car for the first time .
And this picture was <unk> by <unk> .
It was <unk> <unk> in control .
It 's a picture of the first <unk> of particles that had done all the <unk> , <unk> , with a part of the <unk> , and <unk> particles inside the <unk> .
In other words , when you look at that picture the <unk> , you know , the <unk> machine , which is a great <unk> .
I don 't know if it was to make us more or this , when someone <unk> on Google and <unk> that the <unk> page was this .
That means that we 've had a <unk> impact beyond that scientific .
<unk> a week later , there was a problem with the car , had to these <unk> here -- these <unk> <unk> .
These <unk> <unk> <unk> when the car works at the <unk> of the <unk> .
Now , the <unk> of you <unk> the <unk> and <unk> , " It 's not true . They 're too <unk> . "
And they can do that because when they 're very <unk> become the <unk> <unk> .
So , at least <unk> degrees , at a temperature <unk> at the <unk> of space between stars , these <unk> can bring that <unk> .
In one of the <unk> between the <unk> <unk> , there was a <unk> of <unk> .
So the <unk> <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a electric <unk> .
This was the result .
Now , this is even more <unk> if you think that these <unk> <unk> more than 20 <unk> , and that 's about 30 <unk> .
They <unk> about 50 <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , what we did .
We <unk> them and <unk> .
Now they 're all <unk> at their <unk> .
<unk> the end of <unk> the <unk> will be again .
We <unk> it , and we try to get data <unk> or <unk> , and so on our <unk> to find out what the <unk> are <unk> that <unk> the universe .
Now , of course , in a way , these <unk> <unk> the <unk> on the value of science and engineering engineering engineering and engineering engineering of <unk> . It 's easy to <unk> .
I think the fact that it 's so hard , the fact that it 's about <unk> the value of things like <unk> .
I 'd like to end with the words of a <unk> <unk> , which , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> of the <unk> experiments of his <unk> , his <unk> was Michael <unk> , said , " <unk> is so <unk> <unk> for progress of human mind as the <unk> that the ideas of human mind as the <unk> that the ideas of science are <unk> , and there are <unk> , that we don 't have to be <unk> . "
Thank you .
I want to start <unk> to <unk> when , from children , <unk> with <unk> .
<unk> like <unk> and <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> is <unk> <unk> to the way we <unk> in the world around us .
So , from <unk> <unk> from the <unk> of our <unk> with <unk> objects , with my <unk> <unk> , and my <unk> <unk> <unk> , and my <unk> <unk> <unk> , I started <unk> , " And if we use a computer , instead of having the only <unk> of <unk> as digital <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> information with both of the <unk> ,
and <unk> to our <unk> ?
The question was so interesting that we decided to explore the answer , building <unk> .
In a few words , a <unk> is a <unk> computer as a <unk> .
In a few words , a <unk> is a <unk> computer as a <unk> .
You can <unk> them with your hand , they can " <unk> them , " <unk> " between them , " feel the <unk> and have a <unk> <unk> .
But <unk> , they 're <unk> objects , like <unk> , you can just <unk> <unk> .
<unk> are the example of a new tools for <unk> information .
And as they become more <unk> , <unk> of the <unk> , <unk> of the other , and as they become <unk> , <unk> of the other , as they become <unk> , and <unk> <unk> , we can explore and new <unk> <unk> .
Let 's just just just <unk> a few examples .
This <unk> is <unk> to show : if you <unk> it in a direction , the video <unk> , the <unk> so , if you go to the other hand , you know , if you 're going to go back to the video .
These <unk> <unk> are <unk> of the other people .
If you <unk> them , you 're <unk> what they 're going to around .
If they <unk> , they can <unk> it and they can <unk> a little bit .
If they <unk> , they can <unk> it and they can <unk> a little bit .
They also <unk> their movement and <unk> .
And we realized that one of the interesting <unk> of the <unk> <unk> was the able to use common on the data , for example , <unk> <unk> , which is a color as if it was a <unk> .
In this case , we have three <unk> <unk> as a <unk> <unk> , and I can <unk> it to <unk> the <unk> of color in the <unk> , where they <unk> .
and I can <unk> it to <unk> the <unk> of the color of the central <unk> , where you 're <unk> .
If we 're too much going to be <unk> .
I also <unk> <unk> <unk> , like <unk> , <unk> , math and games where people can try things things quickly , and <unk> the results immediately .
Now I 'm --
This is a <unk> sequence that I do with a <unk> program .
Here we have a words here that 's a <unk> of <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> , every <unk> , <unk> <unk> a letter , <unk> , every <unk> , <unk> , every <unk> , and <unk> a letter on every <unk> , and while I <unk> <unk> words , he <unk> on a <unk> .
Then , after about 30 seconds , you <unk> , and you have a new <unk> of <unk> and new possibilities to try .
Thank you .
So here 's children in <unk> <unk> at the <unk> <unk> , I made it so that I <unk> them , and I <unk> a video .
They 're very <unk> .
And one of the interesting things like this <unk> is that you don 't have to give people a lot of <unk> .
I just mean , " <unk> the words , " and they know exactly what to do .
So here 's other people that <unk> it .
This is our <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> .
It just wanted to <unk> .
They were just <unk> , for him .
Now , this is a <unk> of a <unk> <unk> .
You should build a <unk> for the <unk> . He 's <unk> .
It can <unk> new characters in the scene , <unk> their <unk> .
It can <unk> new characters in the scene , <unk> their <unk> .
So , it 's going to get out the sun .
<unk> : The sun is <unk> .
David <unk> : Now , he brought a <unk> in the scene .
<unk> : The <unk> <unk> .
<unk> ! Yeah !
So , <unk> <unk> and <unk> can make the characters --
<unk> : <unk> !
-- I <unk> his story .
<unk> : <unk> !
<unk> : It 's a <unk> story , and you can decide how to <unk> .
<unk> : It 's a <unk> story , and you can decide how to <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> , <unk> .
<unk> : The last example I have time to show you is a <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> and <unk> music .
It 's a recent tool that has been <unk> , to <unk> music .
The <unk> here is <unk> <unk> as the bottom and the <unk> .
<unk> of these has four different <unk> , and you can choose what use .
And you can also <unk> these <unk> in a sequence from <unk> to your <unk> .
And they just <unk> a " and a <unk> sequence . "
These are effects that you can control from the alive , like <unk> and <unk> .
I 'm going to <unk> it up to a particular sound and then <unk> it .
And then there are the effects of time and <unk> , which <unk> the whole sequence .
<unk> like it works .
<unk> : <unk> : <unk> a <unk> <unk> , " <unk> " sequence " <unk> " <unk> " <unk> " <unk> " <unk> " <unk> " . "
Now , you 're going to take a bottom line .
<unk> : <unk> : <unk> <unk> . <unk> <unk> --
<unk> : And now , I 'm going to <unk> the <unk> to the <unk> , so I can control the effect of the alive .
<unk> : <unk> : I can <unk> the whole sequence of time on the one , or the other .
<unk> : And now , we 're going to <unk> the bottom for more <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> : I can <unk> the sequence " <unk> . "
So I don 't have to <unk> before , but I can <unk> it , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> ,
And now , finally , I can <unk> the whole sequence of the left <unk> <unk> the <unk> .
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is build new <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> to how our brain and body .
And today , I 've had time to show you one of the results of this way , and some <unk> that we try to bring out of the lab .
The concept that I want to <unk> is that 's <unk> this new generation of <unk> objects to <unk> with the <unk> media , which <unk> information in our world in our way we want .
Thank you very much .
I don 't see the time I 'm talking to all of you .
I 'm a <unk> .
<unk> books is my <unk> , but it 's more than that , of course .
It 's also love and <unk> of my life .
And I don 't think that can change .
But , I said , something that happened happened in my life and in my career , which <unk> me to <unk> the whole relationship with this work .
The particular thing is that I wrote this book , this <unk> called " <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , " which , <unk> from my <unk> , for some reason to the <unk> in the world and <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
And the result is that everywhere , people <unk> me as if I was <unk> .
<unk> -- <unk> , <unk> !
<unk> to me now all the <unk> and they say , " You don 't fear of not able to do better than to do ?
You don 't fear to write all life without able to be able to create a book that can <unk> to someone ? "
that can you <unk> to someone ? "
It 's <unk> , you know .
But it could go worse , and then I remember , more than 20 years ago , when I started to say people -- I was a <unk> -- that I wanted to be a <unk> .
I 'm going to be <unk> from fear .
And people say , " <unk> 't you have successful not to be able to successful ?
You don 't fear the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> ?
You don 't fear to do this <unk> all life without any <unk> of them from a <unk> of dreams with the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> ? "
So , you know .
The answer -- the short answer to all these questions is , " Yeah . "
Yes , I fear all those things .
I always had fear .
And I 'm afraid of many other things that people can 't <unk> .
Like <unk> and other things <unk> .
But , as it is to write what I thought and I 'm going to ask is why ?
Is it <unk> ?
It 's <unk> that anyone who <unk> <unk> to be <unk> by a job that you feel <unk> to do .
But what is so particular in the <unk> <unk> <unk> to <unk> health <unk> in a way that other <unk> do not do ?
How do my father , for example , he was a <unk> <unk> and I don 't remember once in his <unk> , in the 40 years of activity where he was asked if fear to be <unk> <unk> ?
<unk> 't it -- that <unk> of <unk> John , how does it go ?
<unk> 't you like that , <unk> ?
<unk> , engineers like <unk> group as a group of course , in <unk> , <unk> the <unk> of being <unk> <unk> .
We <unk> , we have enough this <unk> , and not just <unk> , but <unk> <unk> of all kinds of things , we have this <unk> to be <unk> <unk> .
And they 're not going to be looking at the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> that , just in the <unk> century , <unk> young and often for them .
And the ones that don 't <unk> seem to be really <unk> by their <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , before he died , in the last <unk> said , " Every <unk> my book <unk> me a little more than " <unk> <unk> about the work of his life .
But we don 't know when we say , because we heard these things so long that somehow we 've been <unk> and <unk> the <unk> that creativity and <unk> are somehow <unk> and <unk> that creativity , and <unk> are somehow <unk> and <unk> the <unk> .
And the question that I want to <unk> all here is : are you agree with this idea ?
It 's good for you . Because even though , you know , because it 's not good for this <unk> .
I think it 's <unk> .
And I think it 's also <unk> , and I don 't want to <unk> in the next century .
I think it 's better <unk> our great <unk> to live .
And I certainly know , in my case -- in my situation -- it would be very <unk> to start <unk> to that <unk> <unk> , <unk> the <unk> where I 'm in my career .
<unk> -- look at the time , I 'm pretty young , I have about 40 years .
I 've been about four <unk> of work in me .
And it 's very <unk> that anything <unk> in now , it will be <unk> by the world as the work that after the <unk> success of my last book .
<unk> <unk> , because we 're all about more or less friends here -- is <unk> that my greatest success is to my <unk> .
Oh , <unk> , <unk> , thinking !
You know , the kind of thought that leads a person to start <unk> <unk> at the nine <unk> in the morning , and I don 't want to do it .
I 'm going to continue to do this work that I love .
So , the question becomes , how ?
And so , it seems to me , after many <unk> , that the way to work on is to create a <unk> <unk> <unk> , OK ?
I have to get a <unk> distance between me , which I 'm <unk> , and my natural <unk> on what <unk> <unk> to do . And as we <unk> for all the last year models of how to do we look at the time , trying to find other society to see if you have better and more <unk> and more <unk> .
about how to help people <unk> the <unk> <unk> of creativity .
And that research has brought me to the <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> because they <unk> in <unk> and then <unk> back .
<unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> -- people don 't believe that creativity <unk> from men , OK ?
It <unk> that creativity was this <unk> spirit and that <unk> to men from a <unk> <unk> and <unk> , for <unk> and <unk> , for reasons and <unk> .
<unk> <unk> these <unk> <unk> of creativity .
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> to have a <unk> that <unk> <unk> away .
The <unk> were the same idea , but we <unk> that kind of spirit without a <unk> .
The <unk> is <unk> , because <unk> don 't really feel like a <unk> was a particularly smart .
And I thought that a <unk> was this kind of <unk> <unk> , literally in the <unk> of a <unk> artist , a little <unk> like the <unk> <unk> , and that <unk> out of <unk> the work of the artist and <unk> the <unk> of that work .
<unk> <unk> , that 's the distance I 'm talking -- that <unk> you from the results of your <unk> you from the results of your job .
And everybody <unk> that was so that you <unk> , right ?
So , the <unk> artists were <unk> by <unk> things , like the too <unk> , for example , too <unk> ?
If your job was <unk> , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you had been <unk> by this <unk> <unk> .
If your job <unk> , it was not all your <unk> , you know .
<unk> that was your <unk> to be a <unk> .
And so people <unk> the creativity is in <unk> for a long time .
Then the <unk> <unk> and all <unk> , and we <unk> this great idea ; we put the human human in the center of the universe and the center of the universe and the center of the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and the whole <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk>
This was the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> and people who were <unk> to think that creativity <unk> completely from the <unk> .
And for the first time in history , <unk> to <unk> to this or the artist as a <unk> <unk> than a person with <unk> .
And I have to <unk> , I think it was a big <unk> .
I think that you 're going to <unk> to someone , a simple person to believe that it 's like the source , <unk> and <unk> , <unk> and <unk> and <unk> is a <unk> responsibility to give human <unk> , <unk> and <unk> and <unk> is a <unk> <unk> to human <unk> .
It 's like <unk> to someone to <unk> the sun .
<unk> and <unk> all these <unk> <unk> and creates all these <unk> <unk> on the <unk> .
And I think it was this pressure to <unk> artists in <unk> 500 years .
And , if this is true , and I think that 's the question is , and now ?
Can we do that ?
<unk> back to a <unk> understanding of the relationship between humans and <unk> <unk> .
Or maybe no .
Maybe we can 't <unk> 500 years of thinking in a <unk> <unk> in a talk of 18 minutes .
And there 's probably people in the audience who <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> on the <unk> , <unk> , you make people <unk> <unk> on their projects .
You probably don 't <unk> all about this thing .
But the question I 'd like to <unk> is -- why don 't you ?
Why don 't we <unk> this way ?
Because it 's more than anything else I 've ever heard of the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> process .
A process that , as anyone who ever <unk> to do something -- so , so basically , all of this -- you know , you don 't know .
And , in fact , it can be completely <unk> .
I did this <unk> <unk> with the extraordinary <unk> <unk> , who has now 90 years , but that was a <unk> for all life and said that during his <unk> in the <unk> <unk> , <unk> out in the <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> , in the <unk> , and the <unk> , in the <unk> <unk> .
And he said , " It was like a <unk> <unk> .
And that <unk> <unk> to her from the <unk> .
And I <unk> it up , because he was <unk> the land under his feet .
I decided to have one thing to do at that point and was , words , " <unk> as a <unk> . "
And so he was <unk> to the house and <unk> by this <unk> , and it wouldn 't have to do anything else that take a piece of paper and a <unk> enough <unk> , and a <unk> , and <unk> on the page .
<unk> times not <unk> to be fast enough , so <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> without able to get home and the <unk> <unk> through and she would <unk> through the <unk> , looking for , and she would <unk> through the <unk> , looking for , as she said , " another <unk> . "
Then there were the times -- this piece never <unk> -- there were some of the moments -- there were the moments of <unk> that the was almost <unk> , OK ?
So , he was <unk> at home and he was looking for the <unk> and the <unk> through , and he <unk> a <unk> right in the while he was <unk> , and then said , that was like if you <unk> with the other hand and the <unk> .
<unk> the <unk> of the tail and the <unk> in his body and the <unk> on the page .
And in these cases , the <unk> would be <unk> on the <unk> page and <unk> but <unk> , the <unk> , the last word to the first one .
So when the <unk> <unk> -- it 's <unk> , it 's <unk> to my <unk> process .
Not all my <unk> process -- I 'm not a <unk> !
I 'm a <unk> , and the way of <unk> is ; <unk> at the same <unk> every day and <unk> and work and <unk> on the top .
But even me in my <unk> , I <unk> against that thing , sometimes .
And I 'm sure that also many of you <unk> it .
You know , even though the work and ideas , I <unk> <unk> from a certain source , I couldn 't <unk> <unk> .
And what is this thing ?
And how can we <unk> it so that we don 't lose your head , but , rather , what would we make us <unk> ?
So , as I <unk> , the best example I have is the <unk> <unk> <unk> , which I 've been <unk> years ago for a <unk> .
<unk> <unk> of this , and you know , <unk> , for the <unk> of life has been the <unk> of the <unk> artist <unk> , trying to control , <unk> these <unk> <unk> <unk> .
But then <unk> , he was <unk> , and a day , and he was <unk> on a <unk> <unk> , he <unk> it all for him .
<unk> <unk> , and all of a <unk> this little <unk> of <unk> , which comes in in his head as the <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , and the <unk> , you know , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , but he doesn 't know how to <unk> .
It has no piece of paper , it doesn 't have a <unk> .
So he starts to hear this kind of old <unk> <unk> to grow in him , and I 'm going to lose <unk> , and <unk> <unk> by this <unk> song .
I 'm not enough <unk> , and I can 't <unk> . "
And instead of going to the <unk> , they <unk> .
<unk> the whole process , and did something completely new .
I just <unk> the sky and said , " <unk> , you see I 'm going to see ? "
" It seems to you say a song now ? "
If you really want to <unk> , you 're going to take a more <unk> when I can <unk> care of you .
<unk> , <unk> to <unk> more <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . "
And the <unk> process of <unk> after this .
Not the job , the job was still <unk> as always .
But the process , and the <unk> <unk> that <unk> was <unk> when he <unk> the <unk> , the <unk> out of him , <unk> , which is <unk> out of he <unk> , he <unk> back from where , <unk> that had to be a <unk> and <unk> .
but I <unk> this <unk> , <unk> <unk> a conversation , and this <unk> thing , and <unk> <unk> , but it wasn 't <unk> .
So , as I <unk> that story to change a little bit even the way I <unk> and already <unk> me once .
This idea , I <unk> when I was <unk> , " <unk> , <unk> , " and I <unk> in a <unk> <unk> <unk> where we 're all working on something , and you can 't think it 's going to be a <unk> , that what will will be the <unk> book .
Not just <unk> , just the <unk> book .
And we started thinking about <unk> this project .
But then I 'm going to try and <unk> the air and <unk> us .
So I <unk> my face on the <unk> and <unk> my <unk> at a corner of the room .
And I said to <unk> , " <unk> , what , both of them , you know , if this book is not going to be <unk> , right ?
Because as you see I 'm <unk> everything I have , I don 't have more than that .
So if you want it to be better , you have to <unk> and do your <unk> .
Okay . But if you don 't do it , you know what , you don 't do it .
I started writing the same because it 's my job .
And I 'd like to be <unk> that I 've been <unk> to do my <unk> for me to do my <unk> . " Because it 's so , OK -- it 's in the <unk> of the <unk> of the moon , <unk> music that <unk> forward for and <unk> to the <unk> .
And they were always <unk> , because the <unk> were <unk> and they were <unk> .
But every <unk> , <unk> , something <unk> , and one of these <unk> artists actually <unk> .
And I know you know what I 'm talking about , because I know you 've all seen , at a certain point , a <unk> like this .
It was like the time , and the <unk> <unk> through a kind of <unk> , and he wasn 't doing anything different from the usually , like the <unk> <unk> before , but it <unk> .
And it 's not just like a human .
But it <unk> from the <unk> and <unk> in the fire of the <unk> .
And when this <unk> , at the time , people <unk> what was , he <unk> with his name .
<unk> <unk> , God , " <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , God , " God . "
That 's God , you know .
<unk> <unk> -- when the <unk> <unk> <unk> , they <unk> this <unk> with them and the <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> , " <unk> , " <unk> , " <unk> , " <unk> , " <unk> , " <unk> , " <unk> , " <unk> , " which you can still feel in the <unk> or in <unk> .
In <unk> , when a artist has done something impossible and <unk> , " <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , " <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , a <unk> of God .
And it 's <unk> because we need it .
But , the problem comes the next day , for the <unk> itself , when you <unk> and <unk> 11 <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> , and <unk> of God is no longer .
It 's just a <unk> with a lot of <unk> to <unk> , and perhaps never <unk> to the <unk> to the <unk> .
And maybe no one <unk> the name of God , while <unk> , and so what does have to do with the rest of his life ?
It 's hard .
This is one of the most <unk> <unk> to do in a <unk> life .
But perhaps it 's not to be so <unk> if you don 't believe , you don 't believe , <unk> , <unk> , that the most <unk> of your being being from you .
But you just know that you can <unk> data from a <unk> of this <unk> of this <unk> part of your life that you have to go to <unk> when you finished .
And , you know , if we think it all change .
And so I started <unk> , and it 's certainly how I <unk> it for several months during the <unk> of the book that <unk> soon , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> of my success .
And what I must continue to <unk> when I feel <unk> from this is , I don 't fear .
You don 't just <unk> . You just <unk> your job .
<unk> to <unk> for your hand , any one can be .
If your job is <unk> , <unk> .
If the <unk> , you 're going to <unk> <unk> to you <unk> <unk> some kind of <unk> , for a just time through your <unk> , " then <unk> ! "
<unk> , do the same your <unk> .
And " <unk> ! " You know , " you know ,
I think , and I think it <unk> .
" <unk> ! " <unk> ! "
Thank you .
Thank you .
<unk> : <unk> !
As you know , I 've already been talking about some of these projects on human genome , what can <unk> and discovery new <unk> of genes .
We 're now <unk> a new way . We started <unk> the biology and now starting from that digital code , and <unk> and <unk> life .
We always tried to ask great questions .
" <unk> is life ? " It 's something that many <unk> , I think have <unk> to <unk> at different levels .
We tried different <unk> , <unk> to the <unk> terms .
We 're <unk> for about 20 years .
When we <unk> the human genome <unk> to go from the world <unk> of biology in the computer .
Now , we can we <unk> life , or create new life from this digital universe ?
This is the map of a little <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , which is the species from the <unk> genome between what can <unk> in the lab .
And we tried to reduce <unk> the genome to <unk> a even smaller .
We can <unk> a <unk> of the <unk> of the about 500 genes that are here .
But when we take a look at his <unk> map , it 's <unk> simple than our .
<unk> , that 's simple .
But when we look at all the genes that we can <unk> , one at the time , is very <unk> that this can bring a <unk> cell .
So I thought the only way to <unk> was <unk> this <unk> so that we could <unk> the <unk> for some of these questions .
And so we started the <unk> of " <unk> , " <unk> a <unk> ? "
Can we make the chemistry that we 've never been able to create before , before ?
And , in <unk> , can we make a <unk> ?
A <unk> is simply a <unk> of <unk> <unk> material .
The speed we 're able to <unk> life is <unk> to <unk> <unk> .
We can write the <unk> code , instead , <unk> <unk> rather slowly , but it 's <unk> .
And our <unk> results that are <unk> the <unk> <unk> .
We 've <unk> over 15 years ago .
The process has <unk> a lot of <unk> , <unk> with a <unk> <unk> before <unk> the early experiments .
But we found that <unk> is very difficult .
There are <unk> of thousands of cars in the world that <unk> little DNA , the <unk> of 30 to 50 <unk> and it 's a <unk> process . The <unk> is the long , the <unk> is <unk> , more <unk> .
So we had to develop a new <unk> to <unk> these <unk> and <unk> the <unk> .
And this was our first <unk> , starting to start digital information of <unk> <unk> <unk> .
It 's a little virus that <unk> bacteria .
We designed <unk> , <unk> the <unk> <unk> and <unk> a <unk> of <unk> DNA and <unk> a <unk> of <unk> DNA .
The interesting part is when we took this piece of <unk> <unk> material and we <unk> it in bacteria , the bacteria have <unk> to read this code , and <unk> particles .
The <unk> particles have been <unk> by the cells , they 're <unk> back and <unk> the <unk> <unk> .
I talked about recent members of the <unk> industry that they have of course <unk> this model .
They <unk> more than you .
I think that this is a situation where software can actually build his own <unk> in a <unk> system .
But we wanted to do things in the biggest .
We wanted to build the whole <unk> of <unk> .
I 'm more than <unk> <unk> code .
So we thought we 're going to <unk> in the size of the virus , so that we can change the <unk> to figure out what the <unk> of a <unk> cell .
The <unk> is <unk> , and if you <unk> information information <unk> in a computer , these must be very <unk> .
When we <unk> this genome for the first time in <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> was of a <unk> for every 10 <unk> <unk> .
We 've discovered , <unk> , <unk> . If we used that original sequence never been able to do it work .
A part of the process is to design <unk> 50 <unk> that <unk> with all the other <unk> of 50 <unk> to build smaller <unk> <unk> to build smaller <unk> <unk> <unk> to build smaller <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to build smaller <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> elements here .
You probably read that it <unk> us to <unk> .
So , we have a <unk> code on four <unk> : A , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> of those <unk> <unk> together , about 20 <unk> , and there 's a <unk> order for every <unk> .
So we can use the code for the words , <unk> , <unk> .
What we did we do at the beginning was <unk> .
Some of them have been <unk> by the fact that it wasn 't <unk> .
We designed these <unk> to just <unk> with <unk> .
There are <unk> that <unk> them and <unk> them .
And we started <unk> with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to them to them <unk> <unk> .
But at every step we made these <unk> in <unk> so that we 're <unk> to create a very <unk> <unk> <unk> , which we 're <unk> to see in a minute .
We 're trying to <unk> the process .
So , this seems the <unk> of a <unk> of <unk> .
When you get to these <unk> very <unk> , more than 100 <unk> , you don 't get to the <unk> <unk> to the <unk> <unk> .
You get to the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> biology .
So we 've <unk> other <unk> .
<unk> of another <unk> called <unk> <unk> , which in biology <unk> to <unk> the DNA that will <unk> the <unk> .
So , here 's a example .
This <unk> , called <unk> <unk> , can <unk> three million <unk> .
You can see in the <unk> <unk> as his <unk> is <unk> .
<unk> , 24 hours , it 's been <unk> exactly as it was .
We 're going to be able to do that .
These organisms can completely <unk> .
We 're going to live under <unk> .
I 'm absolutely sure life <unk> in space , and <unk> to find new <unk> of water <unk> .
And actually , actually , NASA 's shown that this happens .
This is a picture of the <unk> that we built using these <unk> , just using these <unk> , just using these <unk> with <unk> design <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> <unk> .
This picture was not <unk> with a <unk> , but with a <unk> <unk> .
It 's so big that we can <unk> with a <unk> <unk> .
These are pictures that <unk> a period of about six seconds .
This is the <unk> we 've done a little time ago .
I 'm more than <unk> code code .
It 's the biggest <unk> of a <unk> structure ever <unk> by man .
It 's got <unk> <unk> to 300 million .
If you <unk> it with a <unk> 10 without spaces , we 're going to be <unk> pages for <unk> this code .
Now , how do we make it work ? How can we <unk> ?
<unk> , by a virus is a <unk> .
It 's a little more <unk> when you use of bacteria .
It 's <unk> even when it comes to the <unk> cells as our : you just <unk> the <unk> and <unk> another , which is basically the <unk> process .
In <unk> , the <unk> is <unk> inside the cell , but we <unk> <unk> that we 're able to do a <unk> <unk> of a cell <unk> to another cell <unk> .
We <unk> a <unk> <unk> from a species .
<unk> are different as the men from the <unk> .
We <unk> some <unk> <unk> in the way that we can decide what to choose what this <unk> .
And then he <unk> with the <unk> <unk> .
And when we put it in the cell was <unk> and <unk> our <unk> the new <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> went into the cell .
And we <unk> that we don 't go beyond , but we tried to <unk> more in there .
This is one of the biggest <unk> of evolution .
We found that <unk> species have <unk> a second or a third <unk> somewhere , <unk> , <unk> in a second thousands of new <unk> to the species .
So who think about evolution as a <unk> at the time you <unk> doesn 't really understand a lot of biology .
We 're going to be <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> that was in the cell <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> we <unk> the <unk> .
It 's <unk> , and he <unk> the other <unk> as <unk> material , has <unk> it , and we <unk> with only the cell and the new <unk> .
It 's become blue because of the genes that we <unk> .
And in a short <unk> of time , all the <unk> of a species are <unk> , and it <unk> of all over in a new species , <unk> on the new software that we <unk> in the cell .
All the <unk> are <unk> , the <unk> are <unk> , and when you <unk> the code <unk> <unk> exactly at what we <unk> you .
Now , this may seem <unk> <unk> , but we <unk> the software <unk> , we can change things in a pretty <unk> .
Now , I 've already <unk> that you don 't talk about <unk> -- but of progress , from three million years and a half years , and I already said that maybe we 're about to create a new version of the <unk> version of the <unk> that we <unk> new new species on this process .
Why do that ?
I think it 's pretty <unk> when we think about our <unk> .
We 're going to go from six and a half billion people in the next 40 years .
Right , to give a example : I was born in <unk> .
Now , there are three people on the planet to <unk> in <unk> ; there 's going to be four .
We 're <unk> now to find food , water and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> for six billion and a half billion people .
We 're even <unk> to do that for nine billion .
<unk> more than five billion <unk> , more than 30 billion <unk> .
That means 100 million <unk> a day .
When we try to find <unk> <unk> , or any kind of <unk> process to <unk> , it will be a huge challenge .
And in more we have to realize all of CO2 <unk> from these materials that <unk> in the atmosphere .
At the day , we found <unk> <unk> all over the world , we have a <unk> with about 20 million genes , and I like to think that are <unk> <unk> for the future .
The <unk> industry just a <unk> about <unk> , and think about how many different things are <unk> out .
Our <unk> are <unk> data from the <unk> reality and our imagination .
We now have <unk> , because of these <unk> <unk> <unk> , able to create what we call the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
We can make a big robot that can produce a million <unk> a day .
Think about <unk> these 20 million different genes or try to <unk> the <unk> to produce <unk> or <unk> , new <unk> , new <unk> , we can change , because of a little team , and create more <unk> biology now that in the last 20 years of science .
And it 's just a standard <unk> .
We can choose to <unk> , <unk> <unk> , chemistry or <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
This is a <unk> of some software software <unk> that we 're working on to be able to <unk> and design species to the computer .
Well , we don 't know how they 're going to be .
We know exactly how their <unk> code .
We 're now <unk> on the <unk> generation .
You also saw that you <unk> from the <unk> was a <unk> experiment .
We 've <unk> second and the third generation that we <unk> enough soon as we <unk> to <unk> as the <unk> or different kinds of <unk> .
But the only way that biology can have a huge impact without <unk> <unk> the cost of food and <unk> the <unk> of food and <unk> the <unk> would be <unk> CO2 in matter before , where we 're working for cells that can reach this goal , and we think we can have the first <unk> <unk> in about 18 months .
The solar light <unk> with CO2 is a <unk> , but in our <unk> in our <unk> around the world , we 've found different <unk> .
This is a <unk> that we <unk> in <unk> .
We <unk> in the deep ocean , at about <unk> meters of water <unk> .
We 're <unk> from CO2 using hydrogen <unk> as hydrogen <unk> as hydrogen .
We 're trying to figure out whether we <unk> CO2 , that can be <unk> by <unk> <unk> , and <unk> that CO2 in <unk> , to drive this process .
So , we think we can think we can be able to <unk> what the basic question , " which is what life is , we <unk> the <unk> goal to <unk> the whole industry .
<unk> . If you don 't do that from TED , where can you ?
We 're going to make a main source of energy .
And we 're working for the same <unk> to create <unk> .
You saw this year with flu , we 're always back a year and with a dollar in less when it comes back to the <unk> .
I think what you can make a <unk> <unk> in <unk> .
So , how the future might start look <unk> , now , the tree of evolution , <unk> bacteria with <unk> , <unk> , and finally <unk> cells .
We 're so in the <unk> people .
Our goal is to make a living enough enough to try to <unk> . Thank you very much .
First of all , I 'm going to show you , the <unk> possible , some <unk> , some fundamental work , in the technology that we 've been <unk> at <unk> <unk> at a year ago .
It 's a environment that you can <unk> is at local level that <unk> with a huge amount of data .
Here we 're seeing <unk> <unk> <unk> with a kind of <unk> <unk> and <unk> , for a fast <unk> , <unk> images as we want .
And it doesn 't matter how big the amount of information that we see , how big these <unk> are these <unk> of data or images .
Most of them are common photographs , but this is a <unk> <unk> from the <unk> of the <unk> , and <unk> in the <unk> of 300 <unk> .
It doesn 't make any difference because the only thing that <unk> the <unk> of a system like this is the number of <unk> on your screen at any time . It 's also a very <unk> .
This is a whole book , example of data not images .
This is the <unk> <unk> . Every <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And to <unk> that this is just about the text and not images , we can do something like that , to really see that it 's about the <unk> of the text , not of a picture .
It could be a little bit <unk> to read a <unk> book .
I don 't <unk> it .
This is a <unk> example . This is a <unk> of The <unk> .
Every great image is the beginning of a <unk> .
And it really gives you the pleasure and beautiful experience of reading the real version of a <unk> or a <unk> , which is for nature a <unk> .
We also did something with the corner of this number , particularly <unk> .
We created a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> much <unk> than what you use in a normal <unk> , and we <unk> you <unk> of the <unk> content .
If you want to see the <unk> of this <unk> , you can see here .
Or other models , or even <unk> <unk> .
And this really <unk> some of these ideas to <unk> the <unk> of space on the screen .
We think this is going to be able to <unk> and other <unk> like that , not <unk> to be <unk> .
Now , the <unk> is one of the most <unk> for this kind of technology .
And on this , I don 't want to lose time , if not to say that we have <unk> <unk> to give you a <unk> in this field .
These are all the streets in the United States <unk> up above a NASA <unk> picture .
So now we 're going to start with something else .
This is actually the <unk> alive on the Web ; you can see it .
It 's a project called <unk> , which <unk> two different technologies .
One is <unk> and the other is a <unk> <unk> computer that has been done by <unk> <unk> <unk> , a student of Washington , with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And it 's alive on the Web , <unk> .
You can <unk> when we do this kind of <unk> , where we can go from a picture to another , and have this kind of experience that .
But the <unk> <unk> of images here actually has a meaning .
The <unk> <unk> of the computer <unk> these images together , so that we 're <unk> to the <unk> places that <unk> all <unk> <unk> near the <unk> <unk> on the <unk> <unk> <unk> on the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . And so , you see some <unk> , and these things are all <unk> at the <unk> level .
I don 't know if I have time I 'm going to show you some other environment .
There are a few more <unk> .
I want to go directly to one of the <unk> of <unk> data , and this <unk> from a <unk> <unk> <unk> that we 've done for the first time , we <unk> to show you what <unk> is really the key behind this technology , the <unk> technology . And it 's not <unk> so much <unk> by looking at the <unk> that we have in the website .
We had to <unk> <unk> and so forth .
This is a <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> images of <unk> in <unk> , other <unk> and <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> . And by saying , you know , you know , <unk> <unk> <unk> a picture that 's <unk> to this model .
So they 're all <unk> images from <unk> and they 're all <unk> <unk> at the same <unk> .
And it 's possible to <unk> this <unk> way .
You know , I never thought I would never have thought to work for <unk> .
It 's very <unk> <unk> to <unk> this kind of <unk> here .
I think we 'll see that this is a lot of different kinds of <unk> : from the phones to those <unk> <unk> , a <unk> number , <unk> in this environment .
And if I can , I can look for the <unk> .
Many are <unk> by <unk> , etc .
<unk> <unk> here is a series of photographs -- <unk> .
This is a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
We can go from the <unk> to the physics of this environment .
The <unk> point is that we can do things with social environment . This is now <unk> by <unk> data from the whole memory of how to <unk> the Earth , from the <unk> point of view and <unk> all that data together .
All of those pictures become <unk> together , and more than the parts .
You 've got a model of the whole <unk> .
Think about this as the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> on Earth .
It 's something that is <unk> in <unk> as people , and the <unk> that you 're going to do for the <unk> with the use .
Their pictures are <unk> with <unk> <unk> from other people .
If someone comes the idea of <unk> all these <unk> <unk> the name , my picture of <unk> <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> of all those data , and I can use it as a <unk> <unk> to <unk> in space , in that <unk> , by using the <unk> <unk> of <unk> in space , using the <unk> of <unk> , and <unk> social experience .
Now , a <unk> of all interesting models of the <unk> of the Earth , <unk> , <unk> not just by <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> , but from the <unk> memory .
Thank you very much .
Chris Anderson : I understood what is your software ?
<unk> : Yeah . What 's doing is basically <unk> .
It 's creating <unk> , if you want , between images .
And he 's <unk> it 's <unk> to the content .
The thing becomes very interesting , if you think about the <unk> of information information that many of these <unk> images .
As when you do a <unk> of images on the web , you <unk> a <unk> and the text on the page has a lot of information about images .
Now , what happens if that picture <unk> all of your picture ?
So the amount of <unk> <unk> and the amount of <unk> that 's <unk> is very huge . It 's a <unk> effect .
CA : <unk> , it 's really amazing .
<unk> : I 'm going to give you a lot .
One of the main <unk> when you <unk> and one of the <unk> research is to be able to live in who has not <unk> the <unk> <unk> , <unk> the <unk> <unk> , <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
We think that the <unk> <unk> <unk> , or <unk> <unk> , or <unk> <unk> <unk> are still <unk> <unk> , or <unk> , <unk> <unk> still the <unk> <unk> , or <unk> , to <unk> the <unk> <unk> , and that the <unk> of <unk> , and that the idea that the world in which we live in in a sense , but it 's just a model of reality , it 's not in a <unk> sense , but it 's a <unk> of reality ,
the <unk> of a particular <unk> of <unk> choices that our <unk> has done , well , or evil , many <unk> does .
And , of course , all <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> . <unk> .
We 're <unk> in <unk> .
We have to deal with the <unk> of death <unk> , so we don 't <unk> it and <unk> --
We all have a art .
What <unk> is the <unk> is the song , the <unk> of every culture .
It doesn 't matter that <unk> are the <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> , or the <unk> of <unk> <unk> , or the <unk> <unk> <unk> , or the <unk> <unk> , or a <unk> in the heart of <unk> .
He was my <unk> of journey in <unk> a month ago , or a <unk> of <unk> in the <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> mother of the world .
All of these <unk> us that there are other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , other ways of moving around the world .
And , if you 're going to take a moment , it 's a concept that can give you hope .
<unk> , the <unk> <unk> of the world create a <unk> of life and <unk> that <unk> the planet and is important for the <unk> of the planet , as the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And you can think of this <unk> <unk> as a <unk> and you can <unk> the <unk> <unk> of all <unk> , dreams , <unk> , ideas , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> in being by the human imagination .
The <unk> is the great <unk> of humanity .
It 's the <unk> of what we are and what we can be as <unk> species .
And <unk> the <unk> has been <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> much faster .
<unk> <unk> , for example , <unk> that 50 percent of all the species has been or is on the <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> diversity -- and you don 't know , in the <unk> diversity -- and you don 't even <unk> to <unk> the <unk> -- and you don 't even even <unk> to <unk> <unk> -- that of the <unk> diversity .
The <unk> of this is , of course , the <unk> <unk> .
When you 're <unk> <unk> <unk> on this planet .
A language is not just by a <unk> or a <unk> of <unk> rules .
A language is the <unk> of the human spirit .
It 's the medium that the <unk> of every culture comes in the world .
Every language is a forest of the mind , a <unk> , a <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
And of those <unk> <unk> , as we 're sitting here at least , at least half is no longer <unk> in the <unk> of children .
They 're no longer <unk> to children , which means less than <unk> something , which is already death .
What 's more <unk> than being <unk> by the <unk> , the last to be the last to talk a language , the <unk> of <unk> or <unk> the <unk> of <unk> or <unk> the <unk> of <unk> or <unk> the <unk> of kids ?
This <unk> <unk> was the state of someone in the world every two weeks : every two two weeks , a <unk> <unk> and door with themselves in the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And I know that somebody of you say , " <unk> 't that ?
The world wouldn 't be a better place if we all know the same language ? " <unk> , then we all <unk> . <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> .
We 're going to talk about a <unk> what it means to be able to talk about their own .
Today I 'd like to give you a journey of <unk> --
a little journey in the <unk> for you a <unk> of what we 're <unk> .
Many of us <unk> that when I say " different ways of <unk> . " I mean , really , very different ways of <unk> .
<unk> for example this <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , which <unk> <unk> <unk> , which <unk> to the <unk> <unk> from the <unk> <unk> <unk> from the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
It 's a <unk> that 's not able to <unk> the blue color of the green because the <unk> <unk> is <unk> in the <unk> , which <unk> the <unk> .
They have a <unk> language and a <unk> rule , " <unk> <unk> " : you have to <unk> a person talking different .
And this has <unk> in the past <unk> , though the <unk> is that in these <unk> families , and they talk to these <unk> <unk> <unk> , no one language .
It 's <unk> to listen to and then you start talking .
I 'm going to see one of the <unk> <unk> I lived , the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , a <unk> that had the first <unk> in <unk> .
In <unk> , they <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
They made out of the top photographs that <unk> them in the <unk> that <unk> <unk> , which this <unk> of the <unk> forest <unk> had never seen anything .
They <unk> the picture of the ground , they <unk> to <unk> a form or a <unk> , not <unk> anything , they <unk> , and they <unk> the five <unk> with <unk> .
But <unk> not just <unk> the <unk> .
They <unk> them .
<unk> percent of <unk> <unk> was <unk> by themselves .
We 've been <unk> to eight <unk> and we found two <unk> <unk> and when we <unk> to know , they <unk> that one of them was so that he died , and then they <unk> the same . [ <unk> ] <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and they had a incredible <unk> of the forest .
The <unk> were able to recognize the animal <unk> from 40 <unk> and <unk> the species .
<unk> <unk> , and I was <unk> a very interesting job when my <unk> of <unk> , I <unk> , if I wanted to go to <unk> in <unk> , in <unk> , in <unk> , and <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> to do the <unk> .
And to give a sense of <unk> , I should have <unk> <unk> culture and that <unk> is not <unk> <unk> .
It 's pretty much about a <unk> <unk> of the world .
Very interesting .
If you ask you to <unk> the great <unk> of the world , what do you do ?
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> , etc .
A continent comes out , thinking about <unk> Africa doesn 't have <unk> <unk> <unk> . And he 's <unk> , you know , the <unk> is not the <unk> of these <unk> very <unk> <unk> during the <unk> <unk> .
What makes the <unk> is the <unk> of life between life and death .
So the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> can be <unk> by the <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> to the <unk> of the alive <unk> , so that for a short moment , the <unk> becomes the <unk> .
And so , the <unk> <unk> , " <unk> go to <unk> God .
We <unk> in <unk> and <unk> God . "
And when you 're <unk> , is the spirit that <unk> you , how can you make you bad ?
So , you know , <unk> events , <unk> <unk> in the <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a pretty strong <unk> of power of the mind when it 's <unk> in a state of <unk> <unk> .
<unk> all the <unk> that I lived with the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , in the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> of the <unk> civilization that once <unk> on the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> in the <unk> of <unk> , the <unk> <unk> on the <unk> .
In a <unk> continent , this <unk> has never been <unk> by the <unk> .
In <unk> , I 'm <unk> by a <unk> , but their education is extraordinary extraordinary .
<unk> <unk> are <unk> by <unk> , and they live in a <unk> world , and they live in a <unk> world , and <unk> <unk> <unk> at the bottom for 18 years .
Two <unk> years from nine years , <unk> <unk> the nine months of <unk> that <unk> in the <unk> of the mother of the <unk> <unk> .
And for all of time , they 're <unk> to the values of their <unk> , and just their <unk> <unk> <unk> , or to <unk> <unk> <unk> -- or to say the <unk> <unk> .
And then at the <unk> of this incredible <unk> , they <unk> out and for the first time in their life , at the age of 18 , see a <unk> . And in that moment of <unk> <unk> , when the sun <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , everything that they have been <unk> in theory . The <unk> does a <unk> , and says , "
" <unk> ? I said , " <unk> as I said .
It 's <unk> . Now it 's <unk> . "
It 's called <unk> and they say that we , <unk> <unk> , we are the <unk> <unk> of the world .
This is very important .
When we think about the <unk> <unk> and the <unk> <unk> and the old history of the <unk> <unk> , which is a <unk> concept in his <unk> , or maybe <unk> <unk> , and say that these <unk> are <unk> <unk> to Earth .
<unk> <unk> are not <unk> or <unk> by the <unk> .
There 's no space for these things in the <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> , but because of time and <unk> , they created a <unk> of the Earth <unk> <unk> <unk> , but <unk> , in a <unk> of <unk> <unk> , but on a <unk> <unk> -- the concept that the Earth can live only because it 's <unk> by human consciousness .
What does that mean ?
I mean that a <unk> of the <unk> that <unk> the mountain is a <unk> spirit that <unk> its <unk> will be a human being <unk> <unk> different and will have a very different relationship with the mountain or that place , which is a <unk> <unk> that <unk> a mountain is a <unk> of <unk> that <unk> that <unk> a mountain is a <unk> of <unk> <unk> to be <unk> .
which is a <unk> of a spirit or a <unk> is <unk> .
What 's interesting is the <unk> that <unk> the relationship between <unk> and <unk> natural world .
I grew up in the <unk> <unk> <unk> that the <unk> <unk> to be <unk> .
And that made me a human being different from my <unk> friends who believe that <unk> are the <unk> <unk> and the <unk> <unk> <unk> and the <unk> <unk> <unk> and the <unk> <unk> that live in the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
If we can <unk> that these <unk> can actually create different , we can actually start understanding some of their <unk> . They 're going to start understanding of some of their <unk> .
I <unk> this picture in <unk> in the <unk> <unk> .
Maybe some of you have heard about the <unk> , the most powerful <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
What makes the <unk> is not the potential of the <unk> , but his <unk> . It 's <unk> by two elements .
On one hand , this <unk> <unk> <unk> a series of <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
<unk> the only <unk> has a <unk> <unk> that <unk> a little bit of the <unk> , but it 's <unk> with the <unk> of a family of <unk> <unk> <unk> .
This <unk> <unk> <unk> , very similar to the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
If you 'll see the <unk> <unk> <unk> for the <unk> , the <unk> that are doing a different <unk> of species , <unk> it <unk> .
<unk> that <unk> on the <unk> is a little bit like being <unk> by a <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> on a sea of electricity . <unk> 't create a <unk> of reality . It doesn 't create the <unk> of reality .
I often <unk> with my <unk> , Richard <unk> <unk> , the man who <unk> the <unk> was <unk> , with his discovery of <unk> in the ' <unk> .
<unk> my <unk> , you can 't <unk> these <unk> as <unk> because if you 're done you can 't tell no one of being <unk> . The <unk> can 't be <unk> because they 're <unk> by a <unk> that 's <unk> in the <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
It 's possible to be <unk> <unk> , if you <unk> with other <unk> <unk> that <unk> .
Now , the <unk> is beautiful : the <unk> that are <unk> in this <unk> are <unk> <unk> , the same necessary for <unk> . The question <unk> <unk> : in a <unk> of <unk> species , like these <unk> to <unk> two <unk> <unk> <unk> , you don 't know , but that if you <unk> in this way , they create a <unk> version that is <unk> to the <unk> ?
We use the great <unk> of the <unk> and the <unk> , which can <unk> <unk> .
But if you go to the <unk> , we 'll be " The plants are talking about . "
What does that mean ?
This <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , which <unk> <unk> in the forest , and our eyes <unk> in the forest , and our eyes <unk> in the same species .
If you know , as the <unk> their <unk> , " <unk> " <unk> " <unk> " <unk> " <unk> " <unk> " <unk> . " I said , " No . "
The solution is : they take the <unk> <unk> in a night night <unk> <unk> and <unk> with a different <unk> .
And you don 't really <unk> to <unk> , but it 's a lot more interesting than <unk> <unk> .
Now , the problem is that even the ones of us who have <unk> <unk> them , but in a way to the <unk> <unk> of history than our real world , and <unk> .
In fact the <unk> century , in 300 years , not <unk> <unk> for his <unk> or <unk> <unk> , but rather like the <unk> was where we <unk> and <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> the <unk> of diversity and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> the <unk> of diversity and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> on the planet . Now , the problem is not the change . Now , it 's not the change .
All <unk> through the <unk> have been <unk> in a <unk> for new possibilities of life .
And the problem is not technology .
The <unk> <unk> have no <unk> to be <unk> when they put <unk> <unk> and <unk> as the <unk> <unk> , they don 't have <unk> to be <unk> when they put <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
It 's not the change or technology that <unk> the <unk> . It 's the power .
The <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And if you look at the world , you know , you know , they 're not <unk> to <unk> .
They 're <unk> creatures and <unk> <unk> <unk> out of the <unk> forces that go beyond their <unk> of <unk> .
<unk> that <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> --
a <unk> <unk> <unk> , where you can see the <unk> <unk> from the <unk> , a <unk> that has lived in the forest to a generation ago , and now <unk> to the <unk> and the <unk> on the <unk> of the <unk> , where you can see the <unk> <unk> from the <unk> <unk> <unk> , where you can see the <unk> <unk> <unk> , where the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , where the <unk> <unk> <unk> ,
We 're going to <unk> the <unk> with the <unk> <unk> to the forest .
Or , in the <unk> , are the diseases that are <unk> with the <unk> discovery .
If we <unk> on the <unk> of the <unk> , where I 'm doing a lot of research , you 'll see the <unk> <unk> of political <unk> .
As <unk> <unk> , <unk> physics of a <unk> , is <unk> at the <unk> , but <unk> , <unk> , <unk> of <unk> <unk> , not only is <unk> , but <unk> <unk> in certain <unk> , because it 's part of the development of the development .
And you can 't understand the <unk> of the <unk> until you get away from the beginning .
I <unk> <unk> miles from <unk> in China , through the <unk> <unk> , <unk> to <unk> with a young <unk> , but only it <unk> to <unk> with a young <unk> , but only the <unk> <unk> that you can talk .
<unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> million people <unk> from the <unk> during the <unk> <unk> .
The father of this guy was <unk> at <unk> <unk> .
Which means that it was <unk> at the time of Chinese <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> with <unk> <unk> during the <unk> that has brought the <unk> in <unk> .
My mother was <unk> and his <unk> was <unk> .
It was brought to <unk> in <unk> at the age of two <unk> years of his <unk> , because he couldn 't have without him .
The <unk> , who did the same , was <unk> in <unk> .
One day he <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> , and , for this <unk> , was <unk> to the <unk> <unk> for seven years .
The <unk> of <unk> can be <unk> , but the <unk> <unk> of <unk> is from the present .
And then , all <unk> to a choice .
Do you live in the <unk> world or we want to <unk> the <unk> world of diversity ?
The great <unk> <unk> <unk> , before he died , <unk> that his greatest fear was that the <unk> of the world , not only <unk> the whole <unk> of human imagination imagination imagination to a <unk> of human imagination , but a day we <unk> it from a <unk> <unk> <unk> that there were a <unk> <unk> <unk> that there were other possibilities .
And it 's <unk> to remember that our species is <unk> for <unk> years .
The <unk> <unk> , which has given us to agriculture , which has done us <unk> to the <unk> <unk> , <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> , creating the <unk> <unk> , creating the <unk> <unk> , and we talk about <unk> years ago .
The <unk> world has to <unk> 300 years .
That <unk> story , I don 't think we have the answers to all the challenges that we <unk> in the <unk> to come .
When these <unk> <unk> of the world is asked what it means to be human , <unk> with <unk> different <unk> .
And it 's in these answers that we all <unk> the possibility of being what we are , a <unk> species , which has to make all the <unk> and all the <unk> can <unk> . And there 's great moments .
I <unk> this picture on the North <unk> , when I went to <unk> <unk> with <unk> , and this man , <unk> , and this man , <unk> , he <unk> the wonderful story of his <unk> .
The government <unk> has not been <unk> with the <unk> <unk> and in the ' <unk> for <unk> our <unk> , we <unk> them in <unk> .
The <unk> of this man <unk> <unk> .
The family , <unk> for his life , the <unk> away all the <unk> , and all his <unk> .
You want to know that the <unk> doesn 't <unk> the cold , <unk> .
The <unk> of <unk> were made of <unk> fish <unk> in <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> of this man didn 't <unk> at night or <unk> from the <unk> that <unk> .
It 's <unk> away , it <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> in your hand . When I did it <unk> , he <unk> it , he <unk> it <unk> it , it <unk> it <unk> a <unk> .
He <unk> <unk> on the <unk> of this <unk> <unk> , and when <unk> <unk> , he <unk> a dog .
He <unk> the dog and created a <unk> , with the <unk> <unk> has created a <unk> , has <unk> another dog , and it 's <unk> on the <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
What 's about <unk> ? [ [ <unk> ] And this , in different ways , [ <unk> ] [ <unk> ] and all the <unk> <unk> of the world 's <unk> .
<unk> <unk> the <unk> government <unk> to the <unk> of a larger <unk> of California and <unk> <unk> <unk> .
It 's their new <unk> . It 's called <unk> .
It 's a <unk> <unk> . It <unk> all the <unk> resources .
One example of how a <unk> can <unk> with his <unk> .
And , finally , I think it 's pretty <unk> at least who are in these <unk> <unk> of the planet , <unk> that are not <unk> at all .
For someone is home .
<unk> <unk> of human imagination that <unk> to the <unk> of the time . And for all of these children , like the dreams of these children , like the dreams of these children , become part of the hope <unk> .
<unk> , we <unk> <unk> , we <unk> <unk> , we <unk> <unk> <unk> ,
I 'm going to say the <unk> --
<unk> <unk> are not <unk> , but we believe that stories can change the world , and perhaps the best <unk> to tell the stories of the world . Every month we have our <unk> site <unk> million <unk> .
<unk> <unk> our <unk> <unk> .
Our <unk> are <unk> by millions of people .
Our work is <unk> in <unk> to bring our audience to our audience in <unk> places that <unk> from what they <unk> from how they saw and , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , the <unk> world of <unk> in diversity , and we have to find a <unk> of life in a <unk> world and <unk> .
where we <unk> of all <unk> can <unk> to our <unk> <unk> .
Thank you .
I 'm going to talk about some of the things that I wrote in this book that I hope to <unk> other you 've heard and <unk> some <unk> , in the case you don 't know .
I want to start with what I call the <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> ?
The <unk> <unk> of all the society <unk> . The <unk> <unk> <unk> : " If we want to <unk> the <unk> of our citizens . " The way to do it is to <unk> the <unk> <unk> . "
The reason is is , on the one hand , in fact that freedom is <unk> , <unk> , <unk> for humans .
The other one is in the fact that if we <unk> , each of us can act for all of us to do everything that we <unk> our <unk> , without any <unk> in our name .
The way to <unk> the freedom is to choice .
More choices people have , more <unk> , and more and more their freedom , more and more their <unk> , and more their <unk> .
This , <unk> , is so <unk> <unk> in society that no one <unk> of <unk> in <unk> .
And it 's also <unk> <unk> in our lives .
I 'm going to show you some examples of what progress has made possible .
This is my <unk> . It 's not particularly big .
I <unk> a simple note on the <unk> for <unk> .
In my <unk> , there are <unk> <unk> , without <unk> the <unk> of <unk> <unk> and the <unk> <unk> <unk> that you can buy for a huge number of <unk> in the <unk> <unk> that no one of the <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> that no one of the <unk> <unk> is <unk> .
That 's what the <unk> is .
Then you go to the <unk> store for a <unk> : <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
And in this single <unk> store , there 's a great <unk> <unk> .
We can make six and a half million different <unk> using the <unk> that there are in one <unk> .
<unk> <unk> that there is <unk> choice .
<unk> <unk> : the world of <unk> .
Once , when I was a child , you could get all the services <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> that were <unk> by <unk> <unk> .
You <unk> the phone , you know , you know ,
And so , one of that , between the other , was that the <unk> never <unk> .
These times they went .
We now have a <unk> <unk> almost <unk> , especially between phones .
So , here 's cell phones .
My <unk> is in the middle , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , and <unk> for the <unk> <unk> .
If you don 't still have seen in the <unk> store , you 're very <unk> that soon will be <unk> .
And what 's the end of the thing happens is that people <unk> in the <unk> and does this question . And you know , what the answer is , " No . "
It 's not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn 't make it happen .
So , in other <unk> of life that are much more important than <unk> , <unk> , <unk> the same <unk> of choices .
<unk> <unk> : <unk> <unk> , no longer happens in the United States that you <unk> from the <unk> and the <unk> you have to do .
Instead , <unk> from the <unk> , and the <unk> says , " OK , we can do it . " A , or " he said , " OK , we can do it ? "
You say , " <unk> , what do you do ? "
And the <unk> says , " <unk> has these <unk> and <unk> has these <unk> and <unk> these <unk> . "
" What do you want to do ? "
And you say , " <unk> if you were me , what would you say ? "
And the <unk> : " But I 'm not her . "
The result we call it the " <unk> " <unk> " , " <unk> " , " <unk> " <unk> " . "
But actually , it 's not that one <unk> the weight and responsibility to make decisions from someone who knows something , <unk> the <unk> , to <unk> , to <unk> that no <unk> -- and almost of course , is <unk> <unk> -- and it 's <unk> to make the patient .
There 's a huge <unk> of <unk> products , <unk> to people like me and you , that if you think about it doesn 't make any sense , because we can 't <unk> .
But if we can 't <unk> , because we <unk> them ?
The answer is that they want to be <unk> , we call the <unk> to <unk> the <unk> .
<unk> of so <unk> , as we 're <unk> as a <unk> of choice , as you see in this <unk> . " We don 't want to <unk> kids . <unk> their sex at the right time . " We don 't know the kids . We have to <unk> it .
And we can <unk> how many times we <unk> us .
which means every <unk> , <unk> , you have to decide that kind of person .
<unk> to the family and <unk> , a <unk> time perspective , almost to anyone , was that <unk> the <unk> as soon as possible , and you <unk> to <unk> the <unk> as possible .
The only real choice was with who , not , and even what to do after .
<unk> , it 's really to play .
<unk> to students very smart students , and they <unk> them to less work than a time .
And not because they 're less <unk> , not because they 're less <unk> .
but why are I <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , " <unk> <unk> or not ? "
" <unk> <unk> <unk> ? I have to think about <unk> or <unk> ? "
I 'm <unk> <unk> .
And they try to answer these questions , even though this <unk> is not <unk> the <unk> that I <unk> and not get a beautiful <unk> to my <unk> .
And they really have to do that . They 're important questions .
Now , the job : we 're <unk> , as <unk> <unk> , because technology technology <unk> us work every minute , every day , from every day , on the planet , <unk> , <unk> from the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , there 's a <unk> , and I 'm not going to say nobody , where , where the <unk> works .
I don 't say that , because I want it .
What does , means , this incredible choice of choice that we have about the work ? Is that we need to decide , <unk> at all , if we have to work or not .
We can go to see our child , <unk> with the cell phone in a <unk> , the <unk> in a <unk> , the <unk> in the <unk> .
And even though I 'm all <unk> , every minute we see our child , we 're also <unk> , " I have to answer this call ? "
" I have to answer this <unk> ? I have to <unk> this letter ? "
And even when the answer is , " no , that makes a <unk> experience of your <unk> very different from what would be in other conditions .
So , from any <unk> , you look , things and big objects , and big objects , and life is a question of choices .
And one time the world was this : <unk> , there were some possibilities , but it was a question of choice .
The world of today is to <unk> this : The <unk> is , " Is it a <unk> thing , or <unk> ? "
The answer is <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> we all know , so I 'm going to talk about the <unk> .
We 're going to <unk> two effects effects of people .
The first , <unk> , is that <unk> instead of <unk> .
With many <unk> between which choose , it becomes very difficult to do it .
So , I 'll give you a <unk> <unk> : a study <unk> on <unk> <unk> .
A <unk> of my <unk> has had access to the <unk> data , <unk> society , with about a million <unk> in <unk> different companies .
What she 's discovered is that for every 10 solutions that are <unk> in more , the <unk> <unk> of two percent .
With 50 <unk> <unk> , there 's 10 percent less than when you 're available to them , they 're only five . Why ?
Because with 50 <unk> between which <unk> , is <unk> difficult to decide , and the choice is <unk> to the <unk> .
And in <unk> , and still <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , and of course <unk> never comes .
<unk> that doesn 't mean that only means these <unk> <unk> food to <unk> because they 're not going to have enough money , it also wants to say the decision is so <unk> that they also <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> : They 're not <unk> , they 're <unk> for five to <unk> year from the <unk> of work , which would be <unk> to <unk> .
So the <unk> is a <unk> of having <unk> choices .
And I think we <unk> the world like this .
" And finally , for <unk> : <unk> , <unk> , <unk> or <unk> ? "
You 're going to make the right decision , if it 's for the <unk> , right ?
You don 't want to choose the wrong bottom , and you 'll <unk> the wrong <unk> .
So this is the first effect . The second is that even if we can <unk> the <unk> and make a choice , at the end of the <unk> , we 're less than <unk> between which <unk> .
And that 's what 's for .
One of these is that with many <unk> between which choose , if you have one and it 's not perfect , it 's easy to imagine that we could do a different choice that would be better . And what happens is that the <unk> <unk> us to <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> <unk> from the decision , and the <unk> <unk> from the <unk> decision ,
even when it was a <unk> decision .
More choices are , more choices is easy to <unk> any <unk> that is <unk> of <unk> choice .
<unk> , there 's what <unk> call <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> <unk> things that we give things to things that <unk> from what <unk> <unk> .
<unk> , when there are many <unk> possible , it 's easy to <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> and be less <unk> than the <unk> that 's choice .
So , here 's a example . I 'm <unk> with all the one that are not in New York .
But that 's what 's probably <unk> .
There 's this <unk> <unk> .
A <unk> of <unk> .
<unk> <unk> . <unk> day . It 's all about it .
<unk> nothing . But what he thinks is , " Well , <unk> , it 's <unk> . "
" All my <unk> <unk> <unk> . "
" <unk> <unk> just in front of the house . "
And it <unk> two weeks from the idea that 's <unk> -- every day -- the possibility of <unk> where it wants .
The <unk> <unk> for what we have , even when the choice was <unk> .
And the <unk> are the <unk> we 've been <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> ,
So , here 's another example .
This <unk> tells us a lot of things .
It 's about the time , and perhaps the <unk> of living .
But the most important point is that anything you want , you know , you 're not going to do the other .
The things that don 't <unk> have a lot of <unk> that can make less <unk> what we do .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> <unk> .
I tried it on my skin <unk> a couple of <unk> .
It 's almost always <unk> .
Once the <unk> were a single guy , <unk> them and <unk> by <unk> , were <unk> , only after <unk> a life , and <unk> a lot of times , and they <unk> to go well .
So , I started <unk> a couple of <unk> when the <unk> were gone , and I said , " I need a couple of <unk> , this is my <unk> . "
The <unk> said , " <unk> wants to <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> ? "
Do you want them with <unk> or <unk> ? " <unk> " or " <unk> " ? "
" <unk> wants them to <unk> ? "
" <unk> <unk> <unk> , or <unk> ? <unk> <unk> <unk> -- " <unk> to <unk> .
I was <unk> , and after a little bit I was able to say , " I want the guy -- that was the only guy , " I had no idea what it was , so for a time , I 'm going to <unk> all of the <unk> <unk> , and then I was the best <unk> I ever had .
It was the <unk> . With all that choice , I had <unk> the best .
But I 'm going to <unk> .
Why ? I wrote a whole book to <unk> .
The reason I was worse is that with all that choice my <unk> were <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> to be <unk> .
At the beginning I had <unk> <unk> . I didn 't know anything about <unk> when I just <unk> a guy , but when you <unk> 100 different , <unk> , at least a guy had to be perfect .
What I had <unk> was good , but not perfect .
After <unk> , what I was <unk> with what I was <unk> in <unk> to <unk> .
The <unk> of <unk> in people 's life doesn 't make the <unk> that these <unk> have respect to the <unk> of the <unk> themselves .
And this <unk> <unk> , even when the results are good .
<unk> in the world of <unk> .
Because if you <unk> it , I 'm not talking about what I 'm talking about .
The truth <unk> to this .
" And it was better when it was worse . " The reason he was <unk> when he was worse , it was <unk> that when he was worse , you know , it was possible to be <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> , in the world we live in -- <unk> , <unk> citizens with the <unk> of <unk> -- the <unk> that we can <unk> is that things are <unk> to <unk> .
You never <unk> <unk> because your <unk> , my <unk> , my <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
The <unk> of happiness -- what you 're here -- is , " <unk> <unk> . " Yes , you want it . "
I mean -- little <unk> moment -- who I 'm really <unk> and my wife is really <unk> .
I couldn 't do better , I didn 't <unk> .
But <unk> is not always a <unk> thing .
<unk> , a <unk> of <unk> <unk> when you have a couple of <unk> when you have that kind of <unk> is that when you 're not <unk> , and I 'm going to ask you , " Why ? "
" Who is <unk> ? " <unk> is <unk> . "
The world is <unk> . What can I do I ?
When you have hundreds of kinds of <unk> , and you get a <unk> , and you 'll give you who is the <unk> , it 's clear that the <unk> you .
We could do better .
With hundreds of <unk> available , there are no <unk> for <unk> .
So when people make decisions , even if the <unk> is <unk> , they <unk> <unk> and give them the same .
In the last years , the <unk> is <unk> in the <unk> world .
I think a <unk> <unk> -- not the only , but important -- of this <unk> of <unk> is just that people have <unk> experiences because <unk> are too <unk> .
And when they have to <unk> this situation think <unk> is them .
So the final result is that we better , <unk> , but we 're going to be worse .
Let me tell you .
This is the <unk> <unk> , what we all take for good and it 's completely <unk> . It 's not true .
There 's no <unk> that a little bit of choice is better than <unk> , but from this doesn 't really <unk> that much choice is better than a little bit .
There 's a <unk> , <unk> . I don 't know what it is .
But I 'm pretty sure we <unk> from a piece of the level where the choices <unk> our life .
Now , from the <unk> <unk> -- I 've been <unk> -- from the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> is the <unk> .
What it allows all this choice to be in <unk> is the <unk> material .
There are many places in the world , and you know , <unk> <unk> , where the problem is not that they have <unk> choice .
The problem is they have too <unk> .
So the <unk> I 'm talking about is a <unk> <unk> of <unk> , <unk> society .
And what <unk> does <unk> and <unk> is this : <unk> <unk> <unk> spoke yesterday about how those <unk> and <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> to <unk> are <unk> . It 's a <unk> of money .
I mean , these choices , <unk> and <unk> , is not that simply <unk> .
I 'm <unk> <unk> .
They make us worse .
If a little bit of what we do in our society allows choice to be <unk> in the <unk> in the <unk> where people have too few possibilities , it wouldn 't be <unk> .
This is what <unk> call a <unk> <unk> .
A <unk> of income does well for everybody -- not just the poor -- because of this choice in <unk> that will <unk> us .
So , I said , " <unk> , you can become everything you want --
<unk> , people of culture , <unk> : " What do that fish ? "
" It 's <unk> that you can 't do anything in a glass <unk> . "
" A <unk> imagination , a <unk> <unk> of the world --
and I <unk> it , I <unk> it , at the beginning .
But then , <unk> , instead , I realized that that that fish knows that that fish knows that fish knows .
Because the reality of the <unk> is that if you <unk> the <unk> , so that " everything is possible , " you don 't <unk> the freedom . It <unk> .
If you <unk> the <unk> that everything can <unk> the <unk> .
<unk> the <unk> , and <unk> <unk> .
Everybody needs a <unk> .
