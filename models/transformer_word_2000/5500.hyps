The year I showed these <unk> for <unk> that the <unk> <unk> <unk> , which for almost three million years had had the size of the <unk> <unk> in the United States , <unk> <unk> , and it 's <unk> 40 percent .
So , I 'm going to <unk> the problem because it 's not <unk> the ice <unk> .
<unk> <unk> is , in some sense , the heart <unk> <unk> .
You <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
The next <unk> will be a <unk> <unk> on the last 25 years .
<unk> are <unk> in red .
As you see , you 're going to <unk> up to the blue <unk> .
That 's the ice in <unk> , which <unk> <unk> in summer .
You can see that the ice <unk> <unk> , of five years or more , it 's like the blood , which here <unk> from the body .
In 25 years , it 's past , so .
This is a problem because the <unk> are <unk> in the <unk> <unk> around the ocean , where there are enormous amount of <unk> <unk> that , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> in <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , which <unk> <unk> , <unk> this point of not <unk> .
In some <unk> <unk> <unk> is already <unk> in <unk> <unk> is already <unk> by the water .
The <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> . It 's <unk> with a <unk> team .
<unk> : <unk> ! <unk> : <unk> . She 's good . The question is if you look .
One reason is that this <unk> <unk> <unk> .
This is a river <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> had never <unk> <unk> levels .
This is the <unk> <unk> , in the <unk> of <unk> .
If you want to know how it 's the sea level of the <unk> <unk> , here is where the sea .
These <unk> are <unk> .
<unk> else else else . <unk> , the largest <unk> of the ice on the planet .
The last month , scientists have <unk> that the <unk> of the ice is in <unk> , and that the <unk> <unk> <unk> , is particularly <unk> in the <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , like in <unk> level of the <unk> , like in <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> <unk> new <unk> , which few years ago , and a few years ago they were <unk> .
<unk> percent of the world population <unk> half of the world 's <unk> .
<unk> <unk> : This <unk> is the source of the <unk> of this city .
<unk> is <unk> .
But when you <unk> , the same happens to the water .
In California , <unk> <unk> is <unk> <unk> <unk> is <unk> 40 percent .
<unk> are in the crisis .
<unk> , as you read , they 're <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> in the world 's door to a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> are <unk> <unk> are <unk> to a <unk> out of the normal and without <unk> .
<unk> times <unk> in the last 30 years than the <unk> <unk> .
This is a <unk> of all <unk> .
If you look at the context context , you can see the <unk> .
In the last five years , we 've got <unk> <unk> million <unk> of CO2 every day .
Look at the <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and on both parts of the <unk> <unk> , where there 's a <unk> <unk> of oxygen in the ocean .
The most <unk> of global global warming , <unk> , <unk> , which is 20 percent , is the use of <unk> .
The oil is a problem , and the <unk> is even even even even even .
The United States are one of the <unk> <unk> , and <unk> .
And you 're going to build a lot of other <unk> .
But we 're <unk> to a <unk> of the direction .
These are the <unk> projects in the last last years and some <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
And so , there 's a political <unk> in our country .
The <unk> of <unk> and oil have <unk> <unk> <unk> million dollars in the last year for <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , which is a <unk> .
I 'm going to <unk> me something --
<unk> <unk> , in <unk> , where live live , there was a <unk> <unk> billion <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
Maybe you 've seen it on the <unk> .
This is the second <unk> <unk> in America .
It 's happened around <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> of one of the <unk> was this .
<unk> : <unk> is a <unk> <unk> is a happy <unk> and happy .
It 's <unk> here in America , and we 're going to <unk> our economy .
<unk> the <unk> is always <unk> .
It 's <unk> , <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> here is a lot of the <unk> <unk> .
The largest society <unk> <unk> is <unk> . <unk> is <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> : <unk> <unk> -- <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> -- not know what they 're talking about .
<unk> : So the <unk> for <unk> <unk> <unk> .
This is one of them , a part .
<unk> : <unk> : <unk> we see the changes <unk> as a <unk> <unk> to our business .
For this is <unk> a great amount of money in a <unk> <unk> to make public and <unk> the truth of money in the <unk> .
In fact , the <unk> is not <unk> .
We think it 's <unk> -- it 's also a good <unk> .
So , you don 't <unk> change .
We 're going to do it .
<unk> : <unk> : <unk> <unk> -- you 've heard about a lot of .
So I 'm going to <unk> a <unk> structure for how it 's <unk> .
<unk> ! The machines are a little bit of <unk> , but this is the sound of <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> is between the <unk> <unk> <unk> , but the <unk> technology of global <unk> , but the technology of <unk> <unk> that you see it .
I look at a look at a : this is the <unk> technology .
<unk> : <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to the economic <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> : <unk> is in the crisis , <unk> , <unk> , the national crisis , the <unk> crisis .
The <unk> that the <unk> all : our <unk> from <unk> <unk> , like the <unk> <unk> <unk> , like the <unk> <unk> and oil <unk> .
Now , but there 's a new , <unk> solution to <unk> .
<unk> America : 100 percent of <unk> energy , in 10 years .
A <unk> <unk> in America , <unk> more <unk> , and help <unk> the global global <unk> .
<unk> , a solution that we 're going to solve our problems .
<unk> America . <unk> more .
<unk> : This is the last <unk> .
<unk> : It 's <unk> energy in America .
One of the most <unk> ways of <unk> <unk> , <unk> that <unk> our planet .
<unk> : The future is here . <unk> , <unk> , a new <unk> network .
<unk> <unk> : <unk> for places .
<unk> : <unk> America . It 's time to be <unk> .
<unk> : A old <unk> says , " If you want to go to <unk> , you go to go to .
If you want to go , you go , you go , you . "
We have to go , quickly , quickly .
Thank you very much .
The last year I did a <unk> on the <unk> .
And I 'm going to <unk> on how it works .
So , I 'm going to go . And for those that the other time , it 's <unk> is the <unk> is the <unk> of <unk> .
The <unk> is to <unk> the conditions that were in less than a <unk> of a second <unk> of the universe -- until we 're going to <unk> million times a second .
All that 's just <unk> .
This is the car under <unk> .
And I 'm going to <unk> these <unk> <unk> .
This is what I work . It 's called <unk> -- it 's <unk> <unk> -- it 's <unk> feet and it has a <unk> <unk> .
This is a <unk> picture of <unk> in building so you can see the <unk> .
The 10 <unk> of the last year we <unk> the car for the first time .
And this picture was <unk> by <unk> .
It was because of <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> .
It 's an image of the first <unk> of particles that had done all of the <unk> , <unk> in <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> particles inside the <unk> .
In other words , when you <unk> that picture the <unk> , <unk> that the car <unk> , which is a great <unk> .
I don 't know if you was this <unk> to do more or this , when somebody <unk> on Google and <unk> that the page was this .
What is that we have a <unk> impact over the scientific <unk> .
<unk> a week later , there was a problem with the car , we had to be these <unk> here -- these <unk> <unk> .
These <unk> <unk> <unk> when the car works at the <unk> <unk> .
Now , the <unk> between you you <unk> the <unk> and <unk> , " It 's not true . They 're too <unk> . "
And they can do that because when they 're very <unk> , they 're very <unk> <unk> .
So , at less <unk> degrees , at a <unk> temperature temperature <unk> to the space between stars , these <unk> can get that <unk> .
In one of the <unk> between the <unk> <unk> in the <unk> , there was a <unk> <unk> .
So the <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> .
This was the result .
Now , that 's more <unk> if you think that these <unk> <unk> <unk> more than 20 <unk> , and you have <unk> about 30 <unk> .
They 're <unk> about 50 <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , what we did .
We <unk> them and <unk> .
Now , they 're all <unk> to their <unk> place .
<unk> the end of <unk> <unk> <unk> will be <unk> again .
We <unk> , and we <unk> to get <unk> data to <unk> or <unk> , and we 'll go so our <unk> to find what the universe are the <unk> that <unk> the universe .
Now , of course , in some way , these <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> of science and <unk> <unk> . It 's easy to <unk> .
I think that the fact that it 's so hard , the fact of the <unk> , I think it 's the value of things like the <unk> .
I 'd like to <unk> with the words of a <unk> <unk> , which , <unk> in <unk> <unk> experiments of his <unk> experiments , and he was <unk> , and he said , " No is no <unk> for the human mind as the <unk> of the human mind that the <unk> of science , which are not <unk> in our <unk> , which are not <unk> , and we 're going to be <unk> .
Thank you .
I want to start <unk> to <unk> when , children , <unk> with <unk> .
As I was <unk> and <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , actually , thinking , and solve <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> is <unk> <unk> is <unk> <unk> to the way we <unk> most of the world around us .
So , from <unk> <unk> of our <unk> <unk> with <unk> <unk> , and I was my <unk> <unk> <unk> , and my <unk> <unk> <unk> , and I started <unk> , and if we use a computer , instead of you have only <unk> <unk> <unk> as a <unk> , and then you 're using a <unk> , and then you 're <unk> with the <unk> , with a <unk> , with both <unk> ,
and we go to our <unk> ?
The question was so interesting that we 're going to explore the answer , building <unk> .
In a few words , a <unk> is a great <unk> , like a <unk> .
In a few words , a <unk> is a great <unk> , like a <unk> .
You can <unk> with the hand , you can <unk> them , and you feel the <unk> , and they have a screen and they have a <unk> and a <unk> screen .
But <unk> , they 're <unk> , like <unk> , you can just <unk> .
<unk> are the example of a new <unk> <unk> <unk> information .
And as as as as much more <unk> , <unk> of the other , and they become more <unk> , and they become more <unk> , <unk> , <unk> of how we <unk> them , we can explore new and <unk> <unk> .
I 'm going to <unk> with some simple example .
This <unk> is <unk> to show you of the video : if you <unk> it in a direction , the <unk> video so , if you <unk> on the other <unk> .
These <unk> are <unk> of the other .
If you <unk> , you 're going to go around .
If they 're <unk> , you can <unk> it , and they can <unk> it .
If they 're <unk> , you can <unk> it , and they can <unk> it .
They also <unk> their movement and <unk> .
We <unk> that one of the interesting <unk> of the <unk> was the <unk> that we can use <unk> <unk> on the data , to <unk> a color like a <unk> .
In this case , we have three <unk> <unk> as <unk> <unk> and I can <unk> it for <unk> in color , where you 're <unk> .
and I can <unk> for <unk> color in the <unk> , where you 're <unk> .
If you 're too , we can <unk> a little bit of place .
I 'm also <unk> to <unk> , like <unk> , like <unk> , mathematics and <unk> where people can try to try to do things , and you <unk> the results .
Now , I 'm --
This is a <unk> of <unk> that I do with a <unk> program .
Here we have a <unk> game .
<unk> , at every <unk> <unk> a letter to a letter to <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , every <unk> <unk> , and <unk> , and while I <unk> <unk> words him on a <unk> .
And then , about 30 seconds , and you have a new <unk> <unk> and new chance to try .
Thank you .
Here 's the children <unk> in <unk> <unk> <unk> , I 've done it in the <unk> <unk> , and I <unk> them a video .
They are <unk> very <unk> .
And one of the interesting things of this <unk> is that you don 't have to people .
I just say , " <unk> of words , " and they know what to do .
Here 's here other people who <unk> .
This is our <unk> <unk> more than the right one , there on the right .
It 's actually wanted to <unk> .
They were just <unk> , for him .
Now , this is a <unk> of a <unk> <unk> .
<unk> building a <unk> for the <unk> of the <unk> . He 's <unk> .
It can <unk> new <unk> in the <unk> , <unk> their <unk> .
It can <unk> new <unk> in the <unk> , <unk> their <unk> .
Here 's , it 's doing the sun .
<unk> : The sun is <unk> .
David <unk> : Now he has a <unk> in the <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> .
<unk> work ! !
So we <unk> the <unk> and <unk> can <unk> the <unk> --
<unk> : <unk> !
<unk> -- you <unk> your story .
<unk> : <unk> !
<unk> : It 's a story with the end , and you can decide him as you <unk> .
<unk> : It 's a story with the end , and you can decide him as you <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> , <unk> .
<unk> : The last example I 've got time to show you is a <unk> , <unk> <unk> , and I 'm going to show you and <unk> music .
is a tool , <unk> <unk> , for <unk> and <unk> music .
The <unk> here is <unk> as the <unk> , and the <unk> .
And you know , you have four different <unk> , and you can have to use .
You can also <unk> these <unk> in a <unk> <unk> .
And I just <unk> a <unk> , and a <unk> . " And I 'm going to go . "
These are actually , you can control out of the live , and the <unk> .
I 'm going to <unk> a particular sound and then <unk> for <unk> .
And then there are the <unk> as time and <unk> , which <unk> to <unk> the whole sequence .
<unk> like it works .
<unk> : <unk> : <unk> <unk> a <unk> in two <unk> <unk> , " <unk> in a series , the <unk> in a series , the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
Now , you 're going to <unk> a <unk> line .
<unk> : <unk> : Now , I 'm going to <unk> --
<unk> : And now I <unk> the <unk> <unk> , so I can control the effect of the <unk> .
<unk> : I can <unk> the entire <unk> time by one side or another .
<unk> : And now we 're going to <unk> the <unk> for more <unk> .
<unk> : I can <unk> the <unk> . "
So I don 't have to <unk> before , but I can <unk> , <unk> , <unk> more <unk> or more <unk> .
And now , finally , I can <unk> the entire <unk> <unk> <unk> . "
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is building new <unk> <unk> <unk> , more <unk> as our brain , and body .
And today , I 've had time to show you one of this <unk> of this <unk> , and also some chance that we 're trying to get out of the lab .
And the concept I want to <unk> is that 's <unk> this new generation of <unk> <unk> for <unk> , which we want to do .
Thank you very much .
I don 't see the now of you .
I 'm a <unk> .
<unk> books is my <unk> , but it 's more than this , of course .
It 's also love and the <unk> of my life .
And I don 't like that that can change .
But , I said this , something particular is happened in my life and in my life and in my career , and I was <unk> the entire relationship with this work .
The particular thing is I <unk> wrote this book , this <unk> called " <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and I 'm going to be <unk> in the world and <unk> a great , <unk> .
And the result is that everywhere now , people <unk> me like if I was <unk> .
<unk> -- <unk> , <unk> !
I 'm going to be <unk> and say , " You don 't think you 're not going to do it better ?
You don 't fear of <unk> to write the whole life without any more able to be able to create a book that can <unk> to someone ? "
that can you <unk> to someone ? "
It 's <unk> , you know .
But it could go to the <unk> , I remember that more than 20 years ago , when I was saying to people -- I was a <unk> -- I wanted to be a <unk> .
I 'm going to be <unk> by fear .
And people said , " I don 't <unk> to be able to have success ?
You don 't fear that the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> you ?
You don 't fear to do this <unk> for all of life , and you 've never been out and die on a <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> ? "
So , you know .
The answer -- the little answer to all these questions is , " Yes . "
Yeah , I 'm fear of all those things .
I always had fear .
And I 'm also <unk> of many other things that people don 't <unk> .
As the <unk> and other things <unk> .
But , for how do I write it , and I thought , and I 'm <unk> <unk> <unk> is why ?
Is it <unk> ?
It 's <unk> that anybody <unk> to be <unk> by a job that you feel <unk> <unk> .
But what 's so , in the <unk> <unk> <unk> about health <unk> <unk> about health <unk> <unk> in a way that other <unk> <unk> ?
How my father was a <unk> <unk> and I didn 't remember a <unk> <unk> and remember a <unk> time in his 40 years of activity where the <unk> was asked , if I fear would you be <unk> ?
It was never -- that <unk> of <unk> John , how ?
<unk> 't that , <unk> ?
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> engineers like group , in <unk> , <unk> the <unk> of being <unk> <unk> .
We <unk> , we have enough this <unk> , and not only <unk> , but we 're not just <unk> , but we have this <unk> of being <unk> <unk> .
And you don 't want to look at the <unk> <unk> of the dead <unk> <unk> that , only in the <unk> century , <unk> young and often often for them .
And the ones that you don 't seem to be very <unk> by their <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , before you die , in the last <unk> said , " Every my book has <unk> me a little bit more " <unk> about the work of your life .
But we don 't <unk> when we say , because we heard these things so much as we 've heard these things so much as we have a way of <unk> and <unk> the art , at the <unk> , and the art , at the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> to <unk> .
And the question I want to <unk> to all here today is , you 're going to do with this idea ?
I 'm going to tell you this thing -- because it also <unk> by a <unk> distance to me not good for anything .
I think it 's <unk> .
And I think it 's also <unk> and I don 't want to <unk> <unk> in the next century .
I think it 's better <unk> our great <unk> .
And I know , in my case -- in my situation -- it would be very <unk> to start to <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in my career .
<unk> -- you look at , I 'm young , I have about 40 years .
I still about four <unk> of work in me .
And it 's very <unk> that any <unk> of the <unk> that 's going to be <unk> from my work that after I was going to be <unk> in my last book .
<unk> <unk> , because we 're all more or less friends here -- it 's <unk> that my big big success is to my <unk> .
Oh , <unk> , who thought !
You know this is the kind of thinking that door a person to start <unk> to <unk> the nine of the morning and I don 't want to do it .
I 'm going to go to do this work that I love .
So , the question is it becomes , how ?
And so I think , after many <unk> , which the way to work to write to write is to write it is to create a <unk> <unk> <unk> , OK ?
I have to have to find a distance of me , and I 'm going to <unk> , and the natural <unk> on what wrote to get to look at at the last year , and I 'm going to look at the time , trying to find other society to find , if you look at the best ideas and <unk> , and I 'm going to find more <unk> , if you have to find more <unk> , and I 'm going to find more <unk> , and more <unk> .
about how to help people <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of creativity .
And that research has me to <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
And I 'm going to go back and then <unk> back .
<unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> -- people don 't believe that <unk> creativity of men , OK ?
It <unk> that creativity was this <unk> spirit <unk> and <unk> to men from a some <unk> <unk> and <unk> , for <unk> and <unk> , for <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> <unk> these <unk> <unk> of creativity <unk> <unk> of creativity .
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> to have a <unk> that <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> were the same idea , but we <unk> that species of the spirit without a <unk> .
The <unk> is <unk> , because the <unk> didn 't really <unk> that a <unk> was somebody who who are particularly <unk> .
I think that a <unk> was this kind of <unk> <unk> that <unk> literally <unk> in the <unk> of a artist , a little bit like the <unk> <unk> , and I <unk> out of <unk> the <unk> of <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> work .
<unk> <unk> : that 's the distance of what I talk -- that <unk> you <unk> you <unk> from the results of your work .
And all of <unk> that was so that we <unk> , right ?
So , artists were <unk> by <unk> things , like this for example , for example , right ?
If your work was not <unk> <unk> all of the <unk> , all <unk> that <unk> was <unk> by this <unk> <unk> .
If your work , you don 't have all your <unk> , right ?
All of the <unk> that was a <unk> .
And so people <unk> <unk> creativity in <unk> for a long time .
And then the <unk> <unk> and all <unk> this big idea , and we <unk> this big idea , and we <unk> this idea of the universe and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> <unk> and the <unk> <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
This was the principle of <unk> <unk> and people <unk> to think that creativity <unk> completely completely <unk> .
And for the first time in the history , you 're going to <unk> to <unk> this or a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And I have to <unk> , I think that was a big <unk> .
I think I think I think that I think of it , a simple person of being as a <unk> , the <unk> and <unk> <unk> of all the <unk> <unk> , <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> is a <unk> responsibility to <unk> human <unk> .
It 's like to ask somebody of <unk> the sun .
<unk> and <unk> the completely <unk> and create all these <unk> <unk> <unk> on the <unk> .
And I think it was this pressure to have <unk> artists in <unk> in 500 years .
And , if that 's true , and I think that 's the question is , and now ?
Can we do that ?
You go back to a more understanding of the relationship between humans and <unk> .
Or maybe it 's not .
Maybe we can 't <unk> 500 years of <unk> thinking in a <unk> talk about 18 minutes .
And you probably have people between the public <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> on the <unk> of <unk> , <unk> , you do you <unk> people <unk> to <unk> on their projects .
You 're not going to <unk> you all of this .
But the question I 'd like to <unk> is -- why ?
Why don 't you know this ?
Because it 's more sense of every other thing that has ever heard for <unk> <unk> of the <unk> process .
A process that , as anyone who ever <unk> to do something -- so , basically , all here -- you don 't know , <unk> <unk> .
And , in fact , it can look completely <unk> .
I did this <unk> <unk> with the <unk> <unk> <unk> , which has now 90 years , but that it 's a <unk> for all life and said that during his <unk> <unk> , and he <unk> it out in the <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> in the <unk> , and you <unk> it , and you <unk> it , if you look at a <unk> from the <unk> .
He said it was like a <unk> <unk> of the air .
And that <unk> <unk> to her from her <unk> .
I <unk> it , because he was <unk> the earth under her feet .
I 'm going to have one thing to do that point and it was , words , " <unk> like a <unk> . "
And I <unk> it to home and it was <unk> by this <unk> , and it didn 't have to take a piece of paper and a <unk> enough <unk> , and you <unk> and <unk> on the page .
<unk> times I don 't want to be enough , so <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> without able to get home and <unk> and <unk> and she would <unk> it to <unk> through the <unk> and she would <unk> through the <unk> <unk> , looking at the <unk> , and he would be able to <unk> it through the <unk> . "
And then there were the time -- this piece of the <unk> never -- there were the moments where the was almost <unk> , OK ?
So , he was <unk> home and he was trying to the paper and the <unk> <unk> through , and <unk> a <unk> <unk> in the while that he was <unk> , and he was how if you <unk> with the other hand and <unk> .
<unk> the <unk> , and the <unk> in his body and the <unk> on the page .
And in these cases , the <unk> would be <unk> on the <unk> <unk> , but at the <unk> , the last word to the first .
So when you <unk> -- it 's <unk> , it 's exactly <unk> my <unk> process .
I don 't all my <unk> process -- I 'm not a <unk> !
I 'm a <unk> , and my way of <unk> is , <unk> at the same <unk> every day and <unk> and work and <unk> on the <unk> .
But even I , in my <unk> , I <unk> against that what , sometimes .
And I think that many of you the <unk> .
You know , even though the work and ideas I <unk> me to <unk> a certain source of a certain source , I can 't <unk> <unk> .
And what is this ?
And how we can we <unk> it to be able to do you don 't have to <unk> your head , but rather , rather , what does you <unk> <unk> ?
For how I 'm going to be the best example I have is the <unk> <unk> <unk> , which I <unk> a different years ago for a <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , and you know , <unk> , for the <unk> of life was the <unk> of life was the <unk> of the <unk> artist <unk> , trying to control , <unk> these species of <unk> <unk> .
But then <unk> , he was <unk> , and a day while he was <unk> on a <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> everything for him .
<unk> , <unk> , and all of a <unk> <unk> this little <unk> of <unk> , which comes into its head as <unk> <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , you know , it 's wonderful , and you know , but it doesn 't know how to <unk> .
It 's not a piece of paper , it has not a <unk> .
So , he starts to hear this kind of old <unk> <unk> in him , " I 'm going to <unk> , and I 'm going to <unk> it .
I 'm not enough <unk> , and I can 't <unk> . "
And instead of going to go to <unk> , you 're <unk> .
<unk> the entire process , and he did something completely new .
I just like the sky and said , " <unk> , you don 't see that I 'm <unk> ? "
" You look like to write a song now ?
If you really want to <unk> , you 're going to get <unk> of you .
<unk> , <unk> <unk> another today .
I 'm going to <unk> <unk> <unk> . "
And his process <unk> <unk> after this .
I don 't work , the work was still <unk> as always .
But the process , and the <unk> <unk> that was <unk> when <unk> the <unk> , the <unk> that <unk> was <unk> when I <unk> the <unk> that we had no <unk> , and <unk> <unk> it would not be a <unk> and <unk> .
But I <unk> this <unk> , wonderful <unk> <unk> a conversation between <unk> and this <unk> thing and <unk> that <unk> was not <unk> .
So , as I 'm going to change a little bit of the way I 'm going to be a time .
This idea , I <unk> when I was <unk> , " <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and I <unk> , " and I <unk> in one of the <unk> of the <unk> where we 're working on something and we don 't think that it will be a <unk> , which is going to be a <unk> <unk> .
Not just <unk> , just the <unk> book .
And I started thinking about <unk> this project .
But then I <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> in the air and <unk> .
So I <unk> my face in the <unk> and <unk> my <unk> to a <unk> <unk> of the room .
And I said to <unk> <unk> , " <unk> , what if this book is not going to be <unk> my <unk> , is it going to be <unk> my , no ?
Because you see I 'm going to <unk> , I 'm going to be <unk> .
So if you want that it 's better , you have to <unk> and you .
OK . But if you don 't do it , you don 't know what I 'm going to be anything .
I 'm going to write the same because it 's my work .
And I 'd like to be <unk> that I 'm going to be <unk> for me to do my part of " Why -- it 's so , <unk> -- <unk> <unk> in the North <unk> people <unk> <unk> to <unk> the <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And they were always <unk> , because the <unk> were <unk> and they were <unk> .
But every long , <unk> , something <unk> , and one of these <unk> artists , actually <unk> .
And I know what I 'm going to talk , because I know you 've all of the <unk> , a <unk> like that .
It was like the time , and the <unk> <unk> through a kind of <unk> and <unk> through a kind of <unk> and he was not doing anything different from the <unk> , but it <unk> .
And it 's not just like a human .
But you <unk> from <unk> and <unk> in the <unk> of <unk> .
And when this <unk> , at the time , people <unk> what was , he <unk> it with her name .
<unk> your hands and <unk> to <unk> , " <unk> , <unk> , God , God , " God , " God , " God , "
That 's God , you know .
<unk> <unk> -- when the <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> this <unk> <unk> , <unk> this <unk> with them and <unk> <unk> in <unk> . " <unk> , " <unk> , " <unk> , " <unk> , " <unk> , " <unk> , " <unk> , you can see in <unk> or <unk> .
In <unk> , when a artist has done something impossible and <unk> , " <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> -- a <unk> of God .
And it 's <unk> because we need .
But , the problem comes the day after , for the <unk> , when you <unk> and <unk> that are the 11 of <unk> and <unk> God of God . There 's no longer .
It 's just a <unk> with <unk> <unk> , and maybe you never <unk> to <unk> that <unk> .
And maybe one <unk> the name of God still still , and so that it has to do with the rest of his life ?
It 's hard .
This is one of the <unk> <unk> to do in a <unk> life .
But maybe it 's not to be so <unk> if you 're going to be <unk> , <unk> , which you 're going to be able to be able to be from you .
But I just just <unk> that you 're <unk> in <unk> by a source of this <unk> part of your life that you have to go to <unk> , when you 're <unk> .
And , you know , if we think of this change .
And so I started <unk> , and it 's <unk> as I <unk> for different months during the <unk> of the book that I 'm going to be <unk> , the <unk> , <unk> <unk> of my <unk> .
And what I have to go to <unk> when I feel I feel <unk> by this is , not <unk> .
<unk> . You just <unk> your work .
You 're going to <unk> for your part , any of it , can be .
If your work is <unk> , <unk> .
If you <unk> , you 're going to <unk> you to <unk> some kind of <unk> , for one moment through your <unk> , for a moment through your <unk> , then you know , " <unk> ! "
<unk> , you do that the same <unk> .
And " <unk> ! " <unk> . "
I think I think , and I think , I 'm <unk> <unk> .
" <unk> ! " <unk> . " You know , even for the same <unk> of human and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Thank you .
Thank you .
<unk> <unk> : <unk> !
As you know , I 've talked about some of these projects on the human genome , on what can <unk> and about new <unk> of genes .
Now we 're <unk> a new way , we started <unk> biology and now now , we started to <unk> biology and now we 're going to <unk> in a new new <unk> of biology , <unk> and <unk> life .
We always tried to <unk> <unk> .
" <unk> is the life ? " It 's something that many <unk> , I think they have <unk> to understand some of <unk> .
We tried different <unk> , <unk> to <unk> in terms .
We 're <unk> by almost 20 years .
When we <unk> the human genome <unk> , we <unk> the human genome <unk> in the digital world of biology in the digital world .
Now we <unk> us : we can <unk> life , or create new life from this digital universe ?
This is the map of a little <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , which is the species of the <unk> genome , which can <unk> in lab .
And we tried to <unk> the genome for <unk> a <unk> , and more small .
We 're able to <unk> a <unk> of genes of about 500 of 500 <unk> .
But when we take a look at its <unk> map , it 's simple than our .
<unk> , this is simple .
But when we look at all the genes that we can <unk> , one at the time , it 's very <unk> that this can get to a cell cell <unk> .
So I <unk> that the only one of <unk> was <unk> this <unk> way to <unk> the <unk> for some of these questions .
And so we started the <unk> of the <unk> . We can we <unk> a <unk> ? "
Can you do the <unk> chemistry to make these big molecules that we never have to create before ?
And , in case , we can <unk> it to work a <unk> ?
A <unk> is just a piece of <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The speed that we 're able to <unk> life is <unk> <unk> .
Our ability to write the code , instead , <unk> rather <unk> , but it 's <unk> .
And our <unk> <unk> <unk> .
We <unk> more than 15 years ago .
The process has <unk> many <unk> , <unk> with a <unk> <unk> before we <unk> the first experiments .
But we 've discovered that <unk> is very hard .
There are <unk> of thousands of cars in the world that we <unk> little <unk> of DNA , <unk> <unk> , and it 's a <unk> process : the <unk> is the <unk> , the <unk> is , the <unk> is ,
We had to develop a new <unk> for <unk> these <unk> and <unk> the <unk> .
And this was our first <unk> , <unk> <unk> information of <unk> <unk> <unk> .
It 's a little virus that we <unk> bacteria .
We <unk> the <unk> , <unk> the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> a DNA <unk> of about <unk> <unk> .
The interesting part is when we 've got this piece of <unk> material , and we <unk> it in bacteria , the bacteria have <unk> to read this code and <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> are <unk> by the cells , they 're <unk> by cells , they 're <unk> back and <unk> <unk> .
I talked about the <unk> <unk> industry that they have <unk> this model .
They have more than you .
And I think that 's a situation where the software can actually build its own <unk> in a <unk> system .
But I 'm going to do the more in the great .
We 're going to build the entire <unk> of <unk> .
I 'm more <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
So we thought of <unk> in <unk> <unk> of the size of the virus , so you can change the <unk> to understand what the <unk> are the <unk> of a <unk> cell .
The <unk> is <unk> , and if you <unk> information in a computer , they have to be very <unk> .
When we <unk> this genome for the first time in the <unk> <unk> <unk> was a <unk> for every 10 <unk> <unk> .
We 've discovered , <unk> , 30 . If we used that <unk> that <unk> , you 've never been able to do it .
One part of the process is <unk> <unk> 50 <unk> <unk> that <unk> with all the other <unk> of the other <unk> <unk> to build more <unk> <unk> .
<unk> elements here .
you 're probably <unk> that we <unk> <unk> .
So we have a <unk> code on four <unk> <unk> : <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> of those <unk> <unk> together , about 20 <unk> , and there 's a <unk> order to <unk> every <unk> .
So we can use the code for <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
What we 've done is the beginning is <unk> .
Some of the fact that it wasn 't <unk> .
We 've <unk> these <unk> for <unk> just <unk> with <unk> .
There are <unk> that we <unk> them and <unk> them .
And we started <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> with <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> with <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to them .
And in every step , we 've got these <unk> in <unk> so we 're going to create a extremely <unk> <unk> as you 'll see in a minute .
We 're trying to <unk> the process .
So , this seems to <unk> a <unk> of <unk> .
When you look at these <unk> <unk> , we 're going to be <unk> , not <unk> <unk> to <unk> in the <unk> <unk> .
You get to <unk> of the <unk> <unk> biology .
So we have <unk> other <unk> .
And I 'm going to <unk> <unk> <unk> , which in biology <unk> to <unk> DNA that could <unk> the <unk> .
Here 's one example .
This <unk> , called <unk> <unk> , can <unk> three million <unk> .
You can see in the <unk> as his <unk> is <unk> .
In 12 -- 24 hours it 's <unk> exactly how it was before .
<unk> thousands of organisms that are able to do that .
These organisms can <unk> .
We 're going to live in <unk> .
I 'm absolutely sure that life <unk> in space , and you 're going to find new <unk> <unk> .
And then , it 's got to say that this is .
This is a picture of the <unk> we built using these <unk> , just using these <unk> , just using the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> them <unk> .
This picture was not <unk> with a <unk> <unk> , but with a <unk> <unk> .
It 's a <unk> so great that we can <unk> with a <unk> <unk> .
These are pictures that I 'm going to have a time of about six seconds .
This is the <unk> we did a little time ago .
I 'm more <unk> <unk> <unk> code .
It 's the <unk> more <unk> of a <unk> <unk> .
It 's got a <unk> weight to 300 million .
If you <unk> it with a <unk> 10 <unk> , you 're going to be <unk> pages .
Now , how do we do it ? How can we <unk> ?
Of course , through a virus is a <unk> game .
It 's a little more <unk> when they use of bacteria .
It 's more simple when it 's about cells as our : you can just <unk> the <unk> and <unk> another , which is <unk> the process of <unk> .
In <unk> <unk> , it 's <unk> , and we <unk> <unk> that we 're able to do a <unk> <unk> of a <unk> <unk> from a cell to another and <unk> .
We <unk> a <unk> <unk> from a kind of a <unk> .
<unk> are different as men from <unk> .
We <unk> some <unk> in more way we can have to <unk> what you can have to be able to have to be able to have to be able to have to <unk> this <unk> .
And then he <unk> with the <unk> <unk> <unk> all of the <unk> .
And when we put it into the cell was <unk> and <unk> our <unk> <unk> . And we put our <unk> , and I went into the cell .
And I 'm going to <unk> that we don 't go beyond , but we 've tried to <unk> more in there .
This is one of the <unk> of evolution .
We 've found that <unk> species have a second or a third <unk> <unk> , <unk> in a second thousands of new <unk> to that species .
So who think about evolution as a only <unk> at the time you 're not <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> that was in the cell cell <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> we <unk> it .
It 's <unk> , and he <unk> the other <unk> as <unk> material , and <unk> us to <unk> it with only cell and the new <unk> .
It 's become blue <unk> because of genes we have <unk> .
And in a little <unk> of time , all the <unk> of a species are you go to the <unk> , and you have <unk> in a new species , <unk> on the <unk> .
All the <unk> are <unk> , <unk> are <unk> , and when you <unk> the code <unk> exactly what we have .
Now , this might look at <unk> <unk> , but we <unk> the DNA , we can change things in a <unk> .
Now , I 've already <unk> that here is not talking about <unk> -- but of progress to <unk> -- but of the <unk> <unk> , and a half of evolution , and I 've already said that maybe we 're going to create a new version of <unk> <unk> new new new species on this process .
Why do that ?
I think it 's enough <unk> when we think about our <unk> .
We 're going to go from six billion and a half of people in the next 40 years .
Right for give you a example : I was born in <unk> .
Now there are three people on the planet for <unk> <unk> in <unk> ; in 40 years , there are going to be four .
We 're <unk> problems now now , water <unk> and <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , <unk> and <unk> for six billion people .
We 're going to be doing that for nine billion .
<unk> more than five billion <unk> , more than 30 billion <unk> <unk> .
That means percent million <unk> a day .
When we 're trying to find <unk> <unk> , or any kind of <unk> process , it will be a huge challenge .
We have to <unk> the <unk> of all the <unk> of the <unk> of these materials that <unk> in the atmosphere .
At the <unk> today , thank you you at the <unk> <unk> around the world , we have a <unk> with about 20 million genes , and I like to think that the <unk> for the future .
The <unk> industry is just a <unk> about <unk> , and think about how many different things are <unk> out .
Our <unk> are <unk> data from the reality , and <unk> from our imagination .
Now we have <unk> , thank you to these <unk> <unk> , and you can create what we call <unk> <unk> .
We 're able to build a big robot that can make a million <unk> a day .
Think of <unk> these 20 million genes or <unk> to try to <unk> the <unk> to make <unk> or new <unk> , new <unk> , we can change , thank you to have more <unk> <unk> biology now that in the last 20 years .
And it 's just a <unk> <unk> .
We can <unk> to <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
This is a <unk> of some software software <unk> that we 're working for being able to <unk> and design species to .
Well , we don 't know how it will be .
We know exactly what the <unk> is .
Now we 're <unk> on the <unk> generation of <unk> .
You 've seen you know that <unk> <unk> from <unk> was a <unk> experiment .
We <unk> second and third generation that we 're going to <unk> enough to <unk> <unk> <unk> than the <unk> <unk> or different kinds of <unk> .
But the only way that biology can have a big impact without <unk> <unk> the cost of food and <unk> the cost would be <unk> the <unk> of the food , and we 're working for <unk> cells that can get to <unk> this , and we think we can have the first <unk> of <unk> in 18 months .
The solar light <unk> is a <unk> , but in our <unk> <unk> all of the world , we 've found different <unk> .
This is a <unk> we have <unk> in <unk> .
<unk> in the ocean , at about <unk> feet of <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> using <unk> <unk> , using <unk> <unk> .
We 're trying to understand if we can <unk> the CO2 CO2 , which can be <unk> through <unk> , <unk> that CO2 in <unk> , to <unk> this process .
So , we think I 'm going to be able to <unk> what the question of the <unk> of " that the <unk> of " that 's life is , we have the <unk> goal of <unk> the entire <unk> industry .
<unk> . If you can 't do that TED , where you can ?
It 's a <unk> of energy .
<unk> , we 're working for using the same <unk> to create <unk> <unk> .
You 've seen this year with the flu , we 're always going back to a dollar in less when you 're going to find the right <unk> .
I think what you can change building <unk> <unk> in <unk> .
Here 's how the future could start <unk> , now , the tree of evolution , <unk> the evolution , <unk> the evolution , <unk> , <unk> , and finally <unk> cells .
We 're at so much of the <unk> people .
Our purpose is to do in a way to live enough long , to try to try to try to try to <unk> . Thank you very much .
I 'm going to show you , the more <unk> work , some fundamental job , the new technology that we 've got to <unk> up to a <unk> <unk> . It 's <unk> .
It 's a environment where you can <unk> is in local level that <unk> with a huge amount of data .
Here we 're seeing <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> with a kind of <unk> <unk> and <unk> , for a <unk> <unk> , <unk> the images like .
And not matter how big it is the amount of information that we see , how the great are these <unk> of data or the images .
Most of the <unk> are common photographs , but this for example is a <unk> <unk> by <unk> <unk> , and <unk> in <unk> <unk> .
It 's not because the only thing that <unk> the <unk> of a system like this is the number of <unk> on your screen in any time . It 's a very <unk> architecture .
This is a whole book , example of data , no <unk> .
This is <unk> <unk> . Every <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . Every <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And so you know , it 's just about the <unk> and you can 't do something like that , to look at this really , to look at that that 's really about a picture .
It could be a way to read a little bit of a <unk> book .
I don 't show it .
This is a <unk> . It 's a number of one of the <unk> .
Every picture is the beginning of a <unk> .
And it makes you really <unk> the <unk> of read the real <unk> version of a <unk> or a <unk> , which is for nature .
We also did something with the <unk> of this <unk> <unk> .
We 've created a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> much more <unk> than that you use in a normal <unk> , and we <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> .
If you want to see the <unk> of this <unk> , you can see here .
Or other models , or even <unk> <unk> .
And this really <unk> some of these ideas for <unk> <unk> the <unk> of space .
I think this <unk> to put it up to the <unk> and other <unk> <unk> , not <unk> being <unk> .
Of course , the <unk> is one of the <unk> <unk> for this kind of technology .
And on this , I don 't want to <unk> time , if you don 't say we have to <unk> it in this field .
These are all the <unk> in the United States , a <unk> picture of NASA .
So now I 'm going to do it .
This is actually actually <unk> by the Web , you can see it .
It 's a project called <unk> , which <unk> two different technologies .
One is <unk> and the other is a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , a <unk> <unk> <unk> , a student of Washington , with the help of Washington , with the help of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And it 's in the web , <unk> by <unk> .
You can <unk> when we do this kind of <unk> , where we can go from one of the <unk> of experience to <unk> <unk> .
But the <unk> <unk> of the images here has actually a meaning .
And the <unk> of <unk> , they <unk> these pictures together , so we 're going to <unk> places that <unk> all <unk> <unk> on the <unk> <unk> <unk> on the <unk> <unk> are <unk> . And you see the <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> , and these things are all <unk> things are all <unk> .
I don 't know if I have time to show you some other environment .
There are a lot more <unk> .
I want to go to one of the <unk> data of <unk> <unk> and this <unk> <unk> by a <unk> <unk> <unk> that we 've done it work for the first summer for you to show you what we really <unk> is really the key to show you what we really is really the key to show you the <unk> that we have to <unk> the <unk> in the website .
We had to <unk> <unk> <unk> and so on .
This is a <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> images . <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> , and <unk> images of these <unk> <unk> and saying . And I 'm going to <unk> this <unk> <unk> <unk> .
So I 'm all of <unk> <unk> and you 're all <unk> <unk> to <unk> .
And it 's possible to <unk> this way .
You know , I would not have thought of the end of <unk> .
It 's very <unk> <unk> this kind of <unk> here .
I think you see that it 's a lot of different kinds of <unk> : from those <unk> <unk> , a number of the <unk> <unk> , a number of <unk> , <unk> in this environment .
And if I can , I can look at the more <unk> .
Many are <unk> by <unk> , and that 's <unk> .
And then you have a series of photographs -- <unk> .
This is a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
We can go to the <unk> physics of this environment .
The <unk> is that we can do things with the social environment . This is now <unk> data . This is now <unk> data from the whole memory of view of view , and <unk> all those data together .
All of the <unk> are <unk> together , more than the <unk> .
You have a model of the entire earth that <unk> .
Think about this as a <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> on Earth .
It 's something that <unk> in complexity , and the people <unk> , and the <unk> that you <unk> the <unk> of the use of them .
Their pictures are <unk> with <unk> .
If someone 's <unk> idea of <unk> all these <unk> <unk> , my <unk> picture , my <unk> picture of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and I can use it to <unk> in space , using the picture of everybody else , and we have a social experience of everybody else , and you have a social <unk> <unk> <unk> , and you have a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> of all of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Of course , a <unk> of all of this are <unk> <unk> <unk> of the earth , <unk> not only by <unk> <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> .
Thank you very much .
Chris Anderson : I realized ? What your software your software <unk> us to do is that in some point , in the next years , all the next few people in the entire world will be <unk> <unk> together ?
<unk> : Yeah . What 's what 's doing is ,
It 's creating <unk> , if you want , between images .
And that 's doing it in the <unk> of the <unk> .
And the thing is it becomes very interesting if you think of <unk> information that many of these <unk> images .
As you do a research <unk> on the web , you <unk> a <unk> and the <unk> on the Web , you have a lot of information about images .
Now , what happens if you <unk> that picture is you <unk> to all your picture ?
So the amount of <unk> <unk> and the amount of <unk> that <unk> is really enormous . It 's a <unk> effect . It 's a <unk> effect of the network .
CA : <unk> , it 's really incredible .
<unk> : I 'm going to tell you very .
One of the major <unk> when you <unk> and one of the <unk> <unk> is the <unk> that we 're going to live in who have no <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> the past <unk> , <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> thinking that <unk> <unk> <unk> still over the <unk> <unk> , or that the <unk> <unk> are still <unk> <unk> , or <unk> , or in <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , to remember the <unk> <unk> , to remember the <unk> <unk> , to remember the <unk> <unk> , and <unk> the idea that the idea that the world we don 't have a sense of the sense that we have a sense of the world , but it 's reality , but it 's reality , but it 's reality .
the <unk> of a particular <unk> of <unk> <unk> that our <unk> has done , well , or good , many <unk> .
And , of course , all of course , <unk> <unk> .
All of <unk> . All of <unk> .
We 're <unk> to <unk> .
We have to <unk> the death of death , so you don 't have to <unk> and <unk> --
We all have a art .
What I 'm going to <unk> is the particular song , the <unk> of <unk> .
<unk> 't matter that are the <unk> of <unk> <unk> , or the <unk> <unk> <unk> , or the <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> , or a <unk> in <unk> <unk> , or a <unk> in the heart of the <unk> .
He was my <unk> of my <unk> journey in <unk> a month ago , or a <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> , on the <unk> , <unk> , on the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> mother of the world .
All of these <unk> <unk> that there are other ways of <unk> , other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking about , other ways of <unk> in the world .
And , if you look at a moment , it 's a concept that can give you hope .
<unk> , <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> . They have a <unk> of <unk> life and <unk> the planet is important for the <unk> of the planet so as the <unk> <unk> .
And you can think of this <unk> <unk> as a <unk> and you can <unk> the <unk> <unk> of all the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , to be in the human imagination .
<unk> is the great <unk> of humanity .
It 's the <unk> of what we 're and what we can be in how <unk> species .
And <unk> the <unk> was <unk> <unk> <unk> is success , and <unk> much more <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , for example , <unk> that 50 percent of all the species was or <unk> <unk> <unk> of all the species was or <unk> -- it 's <unk> -- in the <unk> of <unk> -- and you don 't even even even even even <unk> to <unk> -- that <unk> <unk> , and you don 't even even even even even <unk> <unk> <unk> -- that <unk> <unk> <unk> -- that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> ,
The <unk> of all that is , of course , the <unk> <unk> .
When you 're <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> on this planet .
One language is not just a <unk> or a <unk> series of <unk> <unk> .
One language is the <unk> of the human spirit .
It 's the middle with the <unk> of every culture comes in the world .
Every language is a forest of the mind , a <unk> , a <unk> thinking , a <unk> of <unk> .
And of those <unk> <unk> , while we 're here in <unk> , at least half of the <unk> are not <unk> in the <unk> of children .
They 're not <unk> to children , which means , <unk> , at less than you know , who are already death .
What 's more <unk> of being <unk> by <unk> , in the last last to talk to a language , the last <unk> to talk about the <unk> of <unk> or <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> ?
This <unk> was <unk> of someone in some of the world every two weeks , two weeks , a <unk> <unk> and door with it in <unk> the <unk> <unk> of a <unk> language .
And I know that somebody of you <unk> " not better ?
The world would not be a better place if we all the same language language ? " <unk> , then we 're going to be <unk> .
<unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> .
I 'd like to show you a journey through the <unk> --
a little journey in the <unk> for you a <unk> of what we 're <unk> .
Many of us <unk> that when I say , " different ways of <unk> . " I mean , really different ways of <unk> .
<unk> for example , this <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , which <unk> <unk> <unk> , which <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> .
It 's a <unk> that 's not able to <unk> the blue blue color from green because the <unk> is <unk> in the time of the forest , which we <unk> the <unk> .
They have a <unk> language and a <unk> rule , <unk> <unk> <unk> , you have to <unk> a person who talks about a different language .
All of that has been <unk> in the past <unk> , but the <unk> is that in these families they 're talking six or seven <unk> to <unk> because of <unk> <unk> .
You can go to hear and then you 're going to talk .
I 'm going to have one of the most interesting <unk> with the <unk> <unk> , a <unk> <unk> <unk> , a incredible <unk> that had the first <unk> in <unk> .
In <unk> five <unk> have <unk> a <unk> <unk> .
They 've done by the <unk> photographs that <unk> them in <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> , <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> had never seen anything about <unk> .
They <unk> the <unk> picture of the earth , they <unk> to <unk> a form , and not <unk> , they <unk> <unk> that they <unk> <unk> , and they <unk> the five <unk> <unk> with <unk> .
But the <unk> don 't just <unk> the <unk> .
They <unk> between them .
<unk> percent of the death <unk> was <unk> by their own .
We 're <unk> for eight <unk> and we 've found two <unk> of death and when we have <unk> to know , they <unk> that one of them was so that he died , and then they <unk> it . And then they <unk> it <unk> it .
The <unk> were able to recognize the animal <unk> by 40 40 <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> years , I was <unk> a very interesting job when my <unk> <unk> <unk> me , if my <unk> <unk> me , I wanted to <unk> me if I wanted to go to <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And for you to give a sense of the <unk> , I 'd have to understand the <unk> culture , and the <unk> is not <unk> .
It 's pretty much about a <unk> <unk> <unk> of the world .
Very interesting .
If you <unk> the great <unk> of <unk> the world , what would you <unk> ?
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , etc .
A continent is always left out , thinking that Africa <unk> has no <unk> <unk> . And instead of course , and you don 't another that the <unk> of these <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
What makes the interesting is the <unk> is the <unk> between life and death .
So the <unk> are <unk> .
<unk> can be <unk> by <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> to <unk> in the <unk> <unk> in the way that for a little bit of a little bit of the <unk> .
For this <unk> <unk> say , " <unk> <unk> you go to talk to God .
We 're going to <unk> and <unk> God . "
And the moment you 're <unk> , is the spirit that you can <unk> you can you <unk> ?
So , you 're going to <unk> these incredible events : <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a pretty strong of the power of mind on the body when it was <unk> in a <unk> <unk> .
I all the <unk> with the <unk> that I 've been the <unk> <unk> are the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> , in <unk> .
<unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> that once we <unk> on the <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that you <unk> on the <unk> .
In a <unk> continent , this <unk> has never been <unk> by <unk> .
And I 'm <unk> today are <unk> by a <unk> , but they 're <unk> <unk> .
The young young <unk> are <unk> from families to three or four years , and live in a <unk> world , and they live in a world of <unk> and <unk> in <unk> <unk> for 18 years .
Two <unk> years <unk> <unk> <unk> .
For all this time , they 're <unk> to values that their <unk> , values that they <unk> their <unk> and only their <unk> <unk> <unk> -- or to say the <unk> <unk> -- or to say the <unk> <unk> .
At the last <unk> of this incredible <unk> , they 're <unk> <unk> out and for the first time in their life , at the age of 18 years , they see a <unk> of the first <unk> <unk> , when the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> , all that they have been <unk> in the <unk> theory , and he says , all they 're going to go back to the <unk> .
" <unk> ? I 'm going to tell you .
It 's <unk> . Now it 's <unk> . "
They call <unk> , the <unk> , <unk> <unk> , we 're the <unk> of the world 's <unk> .
This level of <unk> is extremely important .
When we think of <unk> <unk> and the <unk> <unk> <unk> and the old story of <unk> <unk> , which is a <unk> <unk> in its <unk> or maybe <unk> <unk> <unk> , and say that these <unk> are more than us .
<unk> are not <unk> <unk> . <unk> are not <unk> by <unk> .
There is no space for these things in the <unk> of <unk> or in the <unk> <unk> , but thank you to the time and <unk> , and the <unk> , and the <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> , but on a <unk> <unk> <unk> , but on a <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
What does that mean ?
<unk> to say that a <unk> of the <unk> that the mountain is a <unk> <unk> that the mountain is a <unk> <unk> that <unk> its <unk> <unk> is going to be a different human , or that place a <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> a mountain of <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that a mountain that <unk> is a <unk> <unk> .
That 's the <unk> of one spirit or a <unk> <unk> is <unk> .
What 's interesting is the <unk> is the <unk> between the <unk> and natural world .
I grew up in the <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> for being <unk> .
And so that has made me to be different from my <unk> <unk> that they think that <unk> are the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> that live in the <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> that live in the <unk> <unk> .
If you look at <unk> that these <unk> can create a different <unk> , we start to understand some of them <unk> <unk> . <unk> this <unk> .
I <unk> this picture to <unk> in <unk> <unk> .
Maybe some of you have heard about <unk> , the most powerful <unk> <unk> <unk> .
What makes the <unk> is not the potential <unk> is the potential of the <unk> , but its <unk> . It 's <unk> by two <unk> .
And then , at one one , this <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
<unk> the only <unk> has a <unk> <unk> that <unk> a little bit of the <unk> , but it 's <unk> with <unk> of a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
This <unk> <unk> <unk> , very similar to <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
If you 're going to see the <unk> <unk> , you 're going to be a different <unk> of species , <unk> it has <unk> .
<unk> that <unk> on the <unk> is a little bit like being <unk> by a <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> on a <unk> of electricity . <unk> 't create a <unk> of electricity . It doesn 't create a <unk> of the reality of the reality .
I often <unk> with my <unk> , Richard <unk> <unk> , the man who <unk> was <unk> , with her discovery of <unk> <unk> in the <unk> .
My <unk> is not <unk> these <unk> as <unk> because you 're <unk> , because if you 're done you can 't tell anybody to be <unk> . And <unk> , you can 't be <unk> because they 're <unk> by a <unk> that <unk> in the <unk> , <unk> .
It 's possible to <unk> only if you <unk> with other <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Now , it 's the <unk> : the <unk> that are in this <unk> are <unk> of the <unk> , the same kind of <unk> for <unk> . <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . <unk> <unk> <unk> : in a <unk> species , how do these <unk> <unk> . And if you look at this way , they 're going to be <unk> with this way , but if you make a <unk> <unk> ?
We 're using the great <unk> of the <unk> and <unk> , which can <unk> .
But if you look at the <unk> , we 're going to be . "
What does that mean ?
This <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , which <unk> <unk> in the forest , and that our eyes <unk> in the forest , and that our eyes <unk> in the same species .
If you <unk> like <unk> their <unk> <unk> us , " <unk> <unk> <unk> , and you don 't know all ? " I said , " No , " I said , " No . "
The solution is : you get the <unk> <unk> in a <unk> night , and <unk> with a different <unk> .
With this , you don 't <unk> <unk> , but it 's much more interesting that <unk> .
Now , [ <unk> the problem is that even the ones of us that have to the heart <unk> <unk> them , but in some way to <unk> the <unk> of the history of the history of the history of the history of our world , and over .
In fact , the <unk> century , in 300 , not <unk> for his <unk> or his <unk> <unk> <unk> , but rather as the <unk> was where we 're <unk> and <unk> or <unk> <unk> the <unk> of diversity and <unk> <unk> . Now , we don 't have <unk> and <unk> the planet . Now , it 's not the change .
All the <unk> through the <unk> are <unk> in a new chance to be in a new chance of life .
And the problem is not the technology is .
<unk> <unk> have not <unk> to be <unk> when they put out of <unk> and <unk> as <unk> they <unk> and <unk> as the <unk> have <unk> to be <unk> when they put it out of <unk> and <unk> .
It 's not the change or technology that <unk> <unk> . It 's power .
The <unk> <unk> .
And if you look at a world , <unk> that these are not <unk> <unk> to <unk> .
They 're <unk> creatures , and <unk> <unk> out of the <unk> forces that go beyond their <unk> <unk> .
<unk> that <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of <unk> --
a <unk> <unk> , in <unk> <unk> , a <unk> who lived in the forest to a generation , and now <unk> to the <unk> and <unk> on the <unk> of the <unk> , where you can see the <unk> <unk> <unk> , where you can see the <unk> <unk> <unk> , where the <unk> <unk> <unk> , where the <unk> <unk> <unk> , where the <unk> <unk> <unk> , where the <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , where the <unk> <unk> , where the <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> , where the <unk>
I <unk> the <unk> with the <unk> <unk> .
Or , in the <unk> , they 're the disease that are <unk> with the <unk> discovery of <unk> .
If you look at the <unk> of the <unk> , where I 'm doing a lot of research , you 'll see the <unk> of politics .
As <unk> the <unk> , <unk> physics of a <unk> , it 's <unk> <unk> , but the <unk> , <unk> , the <unk> of a <unk> , not only <unk> , but <unk> in some <unk> , because it 's <unk> in some <unk> , because it 's <unk> in some <unk> .
And you can 't understand the <unk> of the <unk> until you can 't understand the beginning .
I <unk> the <unk> miles from <unk> in China , through the <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> with a young <unk> , but only I was <unk> to <unk> . And I realized what the <unk> <unk> to talk about .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> million people <unk> from the <unk> <unk> .
The father 's father was <unk> at <unk> <unk> .
And the <unk> that means that it was <unk> to the <unk> of Chinese .
<unk> <unk> is <unk> with <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> .
<unk> mother was <unk> and her <unk> was being <unk> .
It was <unk> of <unk> in <unk> age of two years <unk> under the <unk> of two years <unk> under his <unk> because it didn 't have to live without him .
The <unk> , who did the same , it was <unk> in <unk> <unk> .
A day he <unk> a <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> and , for this <unk> , was <unk> to <unk> the <unk> for seven years .
The pain of <unk> can be <unk> , but the spirit of the <unk> <unk> is by <unk> .
And then , you 're going to <unk> a choice .
<unk> live in the world of <unk> or we want to <unk> the world of diversity ?
The great <unk> <unk> <unk> , before you die of her <unk> , and in our <unk> <unk> <unk> , in our <unk> <unk> <unk> of human imagination , not only <unk> the whole <unk> of human imagination to a <unk> <unk> of human imagination to a <unk> <unk> of thinking , but a day we had a <unk> <unk> that there were other <unk> .
And it 's <unk> to remember that our species is <unk> for <unk> years .
The <unk> <unk> , which has given us to <unk> , and we did <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> the <unk> of <unk> , <unk> the <unk> of <unk> , creating the <unk> of <unk> , creating the <unk> <unk> , and we talk about <unk> years ago .
The <unk> world has <unk> <unk> 300 years .
And the <unk> story I don 't <unk> that we have the answers to all the challenges that we have the answers to be .
When these <unk> of <unk> <unk> in the world is asked what it to be human , <unk> with <unk> <unk> .
And it 's in these answers that we all <unk> the chance to be what we 're : a kind of <unk> , which we 're going to be able to <unk> and all the <unk> can <unk> . And there are great times .
I <unk> this picture on the <unk> <unk> of <unk> , when I went to <unk> <unk> with <unk> , and this man , <unk> me , and this man , <unk> me a wonderful story of his <unk> .
The government <unk> was not always <unk> with the <unk> <unk> and in the <unk> <unk> and in the <unk> <unk> our <unk> , we <unk> them in <unk> .
The <unk> of this man <unk> .
<unk> family , <unk> for his life , <unk> <unk> all the <unk> , and all her <unk> .
You know , you know that the <unk> don 't <unk> the cold , <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> were <unk> in <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> of this man didn 't <unk> by the night or <unk> by <unk> <unk> .
It 's <unk> , you 're <unk> the <unk> in skin <unk> and <unk> in your hand . When I did it , he <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> creating a <unk> .
He <unk> <unk> on the <unk> of this <unk> <unk> , and when <unk> <unk> , he has <unk> a dog .
He <unk> the dog and created a <unk> , with <unk> <unk> <unk> created a <unk> , has <unk> a <unk> , and it 's <unk> on the <unk> , <unk> in <unk> .
<unk> to talk about <unk> ? [ [ <unk> ] And this , in different ways , [ [ <unk> is the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> and all the <unk> <unk> of the world .
<unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> government <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> control of a <unk> area of a <unk> area of California and <unk> <unk> together .
It 's their new <unk> . It 's called <unk> .
It 's a <unk> . <unk> all the resources .
One <unk> example of how a <unk> can <unk> with his <unk> .
And , to end , I think it 's pretty <unk> at least at least who 's been in these <unk> <unk> , <unk> that they 're not going to be <unk> .
For somebody is home is .
<unk> <unk> of the human imagination that <unk> to <unk> in the time . And for us all , the <unk> of these children , as the <unk> of our children , as part of the hope .
For course , we 're <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> are <unk> that <unk> never <unk> .
I think that <unk> --
<unk> : <unk> are not <unk> , but we believe that stories can change the world , and maybe we 're the best <unk> to tell the stories of the world 's <unk> . Every month our website <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> our <unk> .
Our <unk> are <unk> by millions of people .
Our work is <unk> in <unk> for our public places that <unk> <unk> from which <unk> <unk> from which <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> , and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> for the <unk> <unk> <unk> , and we have to find a <unk> <unk> <unk> in diversity , and we need to find a <unk> <unk> in a world .
where the <unk> <unk> can <unk> our <unk> <unk> .
Thank you .
I 'm going to talk about some things I 've written in this book I hope you 've already heard of the <unk> , and I 'm going to <unk> them .
I want to start with what I call " the <unk> <unk> . "
<unk> <unk> ?
The <unk> <unk> of all the society <unk> <unk> . The <unk> <unk> <unk> : " If we want to <unk> our citizens " . " The way to do it is <unk> . "
The reason is , by one side , in fact that the freedom is in itself a value , is <unk> , <unk> for humans .
<unk> is what we 're going to be in fact that if we 're <unk> , each of us can do everything that we <unk> our <unk> , without no one that we 're going to be in our <unk> .
The way to <unk> the freedom is <unk> .
<unk> people have , more choices are <unk> , and more is their freedom , and more is their <unk> , and more than their <unk> .
This , <unk> , it 's so <unk> <unk> in society that nobody <unk> <unk> in <unk> .
And it 's also <unk> in our lives .
I 'm going to show you some examples of what the progress has possible .
This is my <unk> . It 's not particularly great .
I 'm going to give me a simple <unk> on the <unk> .
In my <unk> are <unk> <unk> , without <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and 12 <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and 12 <unk> <unk> that you can buy for a huge number of <unk> in <unk> <unk> <unk> .
That 's what the <unk> .
And then you go to <unk> <unk> for a <unk> : <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
And in this single <unk> <unk> , there 's a great number of <unk> <unk> .
We can make six million <unk> using the <unk> that there are in one of the <unk> .
<unk> <unk> that there is <unk> .
<unk> <unk> : the world 's <unk> .
Once , when I was a child , they could get all the <unk> <unk> , <unk> who were <unk> by <unk> <unk> .
You <unk> the phone , you don 't <unk> it .
One one of that , between the other , was that the phone never <unk> .
These are <unk> .
We 're now a <unk> of <unk> , especially between the <unk> .
Here 's the future .
My <unk> is the middle , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , and <unk> for <unk> <unk> .
If you don 't have the <unk> you still see in the <unk> , you 're going to be sure you 're going to be <unk> .
And what 's what people are going to be in <unk> and do this question . And you know , is the answer ? The answer is , " No . "
It 's not possible to buy a phone that doesn 't <unk> things .
So , in other <unk> of life that are much more important than <unk> , you have <unk> the same <unk> of choices .
<unk> <unk> : It 's not going on in the United States you <unk> and <unk> you have to do .
Instead , <unk> from <unk> , and the <unk> says , " OK , " OK , we could do it , or <unk> , " he 's " " " " " <unk> " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " "
You <unk> : " <unk> , what do ? "
And the <unk> says , " <unk> , " <unk> these <unk> , and <unk> these <unk> , and <unk> these <unk> . "
" What do you want to do ? "
And you say , " <unk> if she was me , what would you say ? "
And the <unk> : " But I 'm not she 's not her . "
The result of the <unk> " <unk> , " <unk> that makes it look like a great thing .
But it 's not that one <unk> the weight and responsibility to take decisions from someone who knows something , <unk> the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , to <unk> , and almost , it 's <unk> -- and so it 's <unk> -- and so you don 't have to take it .
There is a huge <unk> of <unk> products , <unk> people like me and you , you know , if you think it doesn 't have any sense , because we don 't think about it .
But if we can 't <unk> , why ?
The answer is they want to <unk> the <unk> for <unk> <unk> .
And I think it 's a fundamental thing as a <unk> is a question of choice , as you see in this <unk> <unk> . " We don 't want to <unk> the children to the right time . " We don 't have to <unk> .
And we can <unk> us .
And what it means that every <unk> , you have to decide that kind of person you want to be .
<unk> to the family and <unk> , a time the common perspective , <unk> almost for anyone , was that you get the more possible possible , and you <unk> to get the <unk> to the more possible possible .
The only real choice was with who , not when , and even what you do after .
<unk> , all is really <unk> to play .
I 'm going to go to very smart , and they <unk> them , in less work than a time .
And because they 're not not <unk> , because they 're not less <unk> .
But why are I <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , or not ? <unk> do that now ? "
" <unk> <unk> later ? I have to think before the children or to the career ? "
I 'm <unk> <unk> .
And they 're trying to answer these questions , even though this <unk> <unk> , and you don 't have a <unk> <unk> to my <unk> .
And they have to do that . I 'm important questions .
Now , the work : we 're <unk> , like <unk> <unk> , because technology technology us to work every day , every day , and every day , the <unk> of the planet , <unk> that <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , there 's a <unk> , and I don 't tell you what the <unk> works .
I don 't tell you , because I want to use it .
What does , this incredible <unk> of choice we have about the work ? It 's we have to <unk> , <unk> in every moment , if we have to work or not .
We can go to see our son to <unk> , with the phone in a <unk> , the <unk> in a <unk> , and the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , on the <unk> .
And even if I 'm all <unk> , every minute we see our son <unk> , we 're also <unk> , we 're also going to answer this ? "
" I have to answer this <unk> ? I have to <unk> this ? "
And even when the answer is , it 's " no , that 's the experience of your son very different <unk> from what it would be in other conditions .
So , from any part of the look at , and great objects , and <unk> , and <unk> , life is a question of choices .
One time the world was this : <unk> , there were some chance , but it was not a question of choice .
The world 's <unk> today today , <unk> is , " That 's a <unk> thing , or <unk> ? "
The answer is <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> them , so I 'm going to talk about the <unk> .
<unk> this choice <unk> two , you know , two <unk> , you 're actually <unk> on people .
The first , <unk> , is that <unk> <unk> .
With many <unk> , it becomes very difficult to do that .
I 'm going to show you a <unk> <unk> : a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
One <unk> has had access to the data of the <unk> , the <unk> society <unk> , with about a million <unk> in different <unk> .
What she has discovered is that for every 10 solutions that are <unk> in the more , the <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> .
With 50 <unk> <unk> , there 's 10 percent in less than <unk> when they 're available .
Because with 50 <unk> , which is <unk> to <unk> , and the choice is <unk> to <unk> .
And at <unk> , and again , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and of course , you can 't have .
<unk> that means that the decision is not just that these <unk> <unk> food for <unk> because they don 't have enough money , even want to say that the decision is so <unk> that we also <unk> the <unk> <unk> of work .
<unk> , they 're going to go to five <unk> <unk> <unk> for the year of work , which would be very <unk> to <unk> .
So the <unk> is a <unk> of <unk> .
And I think that <unk> the world .
" And I end , for the <unk> : <unk> , <unk> or <unk> ? "
You just take the right decision , if it 's going to be the right ?
You don 't want to <unk> the wrong , and you <unk> the wrong wrong .
So this is the first effect . The second is that even if we can <unk> <unk> <unk> and make a choice , at the end , we 're less <unk> by the result of how we have to <unk> .
And this for different reasons .
One of these is that with many <unk> between the one and you have to <unk> , and it 's not perfect , it 's easy to be better . And what happens is that the <unk> <unk> <unk> us to make a different choice . And what happens is that the <unk> <unk> <unk> us to <unk> us to <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> ,
And when it was a <unk> decision .
<unk> , there are , more , it 's easy to <unk> that it 's <unk> of <unk> .
<unk> , there is what the <unk> call <unk> .
Dan <unk> has <unk> very well as the value that we have to <unk> things that we <unk> .
<unk> , when there are many <unk> , it 's easy to <unk> the <unk> of <unk> <unk> and be less <unk> of <unk> <unk> that you have choice .
Here is one example . I 'm going to <unk> with all the those that are not in New York .
But it 's what you probably <unk> .
There is this <unk> to <unk> .
A place of <unk> .
<unk> <unk> . <unk> day . It 's all for them .
<unk> . But what he think is , " Well , <unk> , <unk> , it 's <unk> . "
" All my <unk> are <unk> . "
" <unk> <unk> just <unk> in front of the home . "
And it 's two weeks , I 'm going to be <unk> -- every day -- the chance to <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> for what we have , even when the choice was <unk> .
And the more <unk> we have <unk> , more <unk> <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Here 's another example .
This <unk> tells us a lot of things .
We 're talking about the moment , and maybe in the <unk> of the <unk> .
But the most important is that you 're going to <unk> , you don 't do the other .
The things that they don 't have many <unk> that they can make less <unk> what we do .
<unk> <unk> .
I tried to my skin <unk> a new couple of <unk> .
<unk> almost always <unk> .
One time the <unk> were a one kind of just , and <unk> <unk> , they were <unk> , only after <unk> , they were <unk> , just after <unk> , and I would go to good .
So , I <unk> a couple of <unk> when the <unk> were <unk> , and I said , " I need a couple of <unk> , this is my <unk> . "
The <unk> said , " <unk> wants to <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> ? "
You want to <unk> or <unk> ? " <unk> or <unk> ? " <unk> " <unk> ? "
" <unk> : <unk> ? "
" <unk> <unk> , you want to <unk> them ? <unk> <unk> <unk> -- " <unk> to <unk> .
I was <unk> , and after a little bit of , I 've been saying , " I want the kind of -- that it was the only kind of what it was , for a <unk> <unk> me . And then I was <unk> <unk> by the <unk> <unk> , with the best <unk> , with the <unk> <unk> , with the best <unk> <unk> , with the best <unk> that I had ever ever ever .
It was the <unk> . And all that choice I had <unk> the better .
But I 'm going to be <unk> .
Why ? I wrote a whole book for <unk> .
The reason I was , it 's what I was that with all of my <unk> were <unk> , the <unk> <unk> to be <unk> .
I had <unk> <unk> . I had no <unk> me when I just <unk> one kind of <unk> when you just have a kind of <unk> , but when you have to be a perfect .
What I had <unk> was good , but not perfect .
And then I <unk> that I was <unk> in <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> of <unk> in life is not <unk> that <unk> the <unk> that these have than <unk> in the <unk> of the same .
And this <unk> less <unk> , when the results are good .
<unk> in the world of the <unk> <unk> .
Because if you <unk> , I don 't know what I 'm talking about .
The truth is more than this .
" It was better when he was <unk> , " The reason he was better when he was <unk> when he was <unk> than it was , when he was still <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> , in the world we live -- <unk> , <unk> citizens with the <unk> of <unk> -- the <unk> that we can <unk> is that things are in the <unk> of the <unk> .
You 've never never <unk> <unk> because your <unk> , my <unk> , you 're <unk> .
The <unk> of happiness -- what you 're here -- that 's , " <unk> " Yes , " Yeah , you want it . "
I mean , little <unk> moment -- I 'm really <unk> , and my wife is really <unk> .
I couldn 't have to do better , I 'm not <unk> .
But I 'm not always <unk> .
<unk> , a <unk> of you buy a couple of <unk> <unk> when there is just that kind of <unk> is that when you 're not <unk> , and you say , " Why ? "
" Who is <unk> ? " <unk> is <unk> .
The world is the <unk> . What can I do it ?
When there are hundreds of <unk> , and you have a <unk> , and you <unk> a <unk> , and you 're going to <unk> you .
I could do better .
With hundreds of <unk> available , there are not <unk> for the <unk> .
So when people make decisions , even though the result is <unk> , they <unk> and they <unk> them to their own .
In the last last years , it 's <unk> in the <unk> .
I think that a <unk> <unk> -- not the only , but important -- of this <unk> <unk> of <unk> is that people have been <unk> experiences because the <unk> are too <unk> .
And when they have to <unk> this situation that the <unk> is they think that <unk> is .
So the end is that in general , we 're better , but we 're going to be <unk> .
I 'm going to show you .
This is the <unk> <unk> , what we all all of it for good . It 's not true .
There is no <unk> that a little bit of choice is better than <unk> , but by this doesn 't <unk> that much choice is better than a little bit better .
There is a <unk> , <unk> . I don 't know what it 's .
But I 'm sure we have <unk> from a piece of the level of the choices that we <unk> our life .
Now , from the <unk> point -- I 've been <unk> -- I 've been <unk> -- from the <unk> <unk> is the <unk> .
What it allows this choice in the <unk> society is the <unk> material .
There are many places in the world , and you 're <unk> <unk> , where the problem is not they have <unk> choice .
The problem is that they have too <unk> .
So , I 'm talking about is a <unk> <unk> of <unk> , <unk> society .
And what it does <unk> and <unk> is this : <unk> <unk> <unk> you talked about how you <unk> and <unk> <unk> for <unk> . It 's a <unk> of money .
I mean that these choices , <unk> and <unk> , it 's not just <unk> .
I 'm <unk> <unk> .
They do it better .
If you have a bit of what in our society <unk> <unk> <unk> in those where people have too much , it would not just be their life . It would not just be their life .
This is what the <unk> call a <unk> <unk> .
A <unk> of the income is good to all -- not only the poor people -- because of this choice in <unk> that we <unk> .
And to <unk> : " <unk> , you can become everything you want to --
<unk> , people , <unk> , <unk> , " But what would you <unk> that fish ? "
" It 's <unk> that you can 't make anything in a glass of glass . "
" A <unk> <unk> , a <unk> <unk> <unk> , a <unk> <unk> ,
and I <unk> it so I <unk> it , at the beginning .
But then , <unk> , I realized that fish knows that fish knows what the long <unk> knows .
Because the reality of the fact is that if you <unk> in <unk> , you can 't <unk> the freedom , you can 't <unk> the freedom . You <unk> the <unk> .
If you <unk> the <unk> <unk> that all you can <unk> the <unk> .
<unk> the <unk> , and <unk> the <unk> .
They need a <unk> .
This is almost too <unk> , maybe even for the fish , and even for us .
But the <unk> of some <unk> <unk> is a <unk> for <unk> and <unk> , for <unk> .
Thank you very much .
