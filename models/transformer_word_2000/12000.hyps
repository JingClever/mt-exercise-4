<unk> year I showed these <unk> to <unk> that <unk> <unk> that for <unk> <unk> <unk> , which for almost three million years had the size of the United States <unk> , <unk> , it 's <unk> 40 percent .
And we <unk> this <unk> of the problem because it doesn 't show the ice <unk> .
<unk> <unk> is , in a certain sense , the heart of the climate system .
It 's <unk> and <unk> <unk> in summer .
The next <unk> will be a <unk> <unk> on the <unk> of the last 25 years .
<unk> <unk> are <unk> in red .
You see , you <unk> up to the blue <unk> .
That 's the ice in <unk> , which <unk> in summer .
You can see that the <unk> ice <unk> , of five years or more , it 's like the blood , which here is <unk> from the body .
In 25 years , it 's past , like that .
This is a problem because the <unk> <unk> <unk> around the ocean <unk> where there are huge <unk> of <unk> that , <unk> , are <unk> in <unk> .
<unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , the amount of <unk> , that <unk> could be <unk> ,
In some <unk> <unk> in <unk> , the <unk> is already <unk> by water .
The <unk> <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> last <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> ! <unk> : She 's good . <unk> : She 's good . The question is if we <unk> it .
A reason is that this <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> from the north .
This is a river in <unk> <unk> .
<unk> had never <unk> levels .
This is the <unk> river , in the <unk> of the <unk> .
If you want to know how the sea level <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , here is where you 're <unk> the sea .
These <unk> are <unk> <unk> .
<unk> other hand on the planet : <unk> , the largest <unk> of the planet .
<unk> month , scientists have <unk> that the ice <unk> is in <unk> , and that <unk> <unk> on some <unk> <unk> , is particularly <unk> in <unk> .
<unk> at <unk> level of the <unk> , like <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> of ice , you see new <unk> , which a few years ago were <unk> .
<unk> percent of the world 's population <unk> <unk> water from that <unk> .
<unk> <unk> : This <unk> is the source of water <unk> of this city .
<unk> is <unk> .
But when you <unk> , the same happens to the water .
In California , <unk> on the <unk> <unk> <unk> is 40 percent .
<unk> <unk> are in crisis .
<unk> , like you bed , are <unk> .
<unk> <unk> in the world door to a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> are <unk> <unk> out of the normal and <unk> .
<unk> times over the last 30 years than the <unk> <unk> .
This is a <unk> of all <unk> .
If you look at it in the context of the <unk> , you can see the <unk> .
In the last five years we have <unk> 70 million <unk> of CO2 every day .
Look at the <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and both of the <unk> <unk> , and both of the <unk> <unk> , where there is a <unk> <unk> of oxygen in the ocean .
The <unk> of global warming , together with <unk> , which is 20 percent of them , is 20 percent , is the use of <unk> <unk> .
<unk> is a problem , and <unk> is even worse .
The United States is one of the two countries with <unk> , together to China .
And they 're <unk> to build a lot of other <unk> .
But we 're <unk> to a <unk> of direction .
These are the <unk> projects in the last few years and some of <unk> <unk> .
There 's a <unk> politics in our country .
<unk> <unk> and oil have <unk> <unk> million dollars in the last year to <unk> <unk> <unk> , which is a <unk> .
<unk> image , I <unk> something --
<unk> <unk> , where I live , in <unk> , where I live , there 's been a <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
You might have seen it on the <unk> .
This is the largest flow of <unk> in America .
It 's happened around <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> of one of the <unk> <unk> was this .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> <unk> is a <unk> and happy .
It 's <unk> here in America , and it makes our economy .
<unk> the <unk> is <unk> .
It 's <unk> , <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> here is a lot of <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The largest society <unk> <unk> on the <unk> is <unk> . This is his <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> : <unk> <unk> <unk> -- Al <unk> , <unk> <unk> -- they don 't know what they are talking about .
<unk> : So the <unk> for the <unk> of <unk> has two <unk> .
This is one of them , a part of them .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> : <unk> <unk> we see the <unk> changes as a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
So our <unk> is <unk> a great amount of money in a <unk> <unk> to make public and <unk> the truth of <unk> .
In fact , <unk> is not <unk> .
We think it 's <unk> -- it also has a good <unk> .
So we don 't know about climate change .
We 're going to do it .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> <unk> -- you 've heard about it very much .
So , we <unk> a <unk> <unk> in a <unk> structure , as it is <unk> .
<unk> ! <unk> cars are a little bit <unk> , but this is the sound of technology <unk> .
<unk> <unk> is between the main <unk> of global <unk> , but the <unk> technology of <unk> <unk> , but the technology of <unk> that you see changes .
So , you look at this , this is the <unk> technology .
<unk> : <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to the economic <unk> and the national security <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> America is in crisis ; the economy , the national crisis .
The <unk> that <unk> all : our <unk> <unk> <unk> , like <unk> and oil <unk> .
Now , there 's a new <unk> , <unk> solution to <unk> .
<unk> America : 100 percent of <unk> energy , in the 10 years .
A <unk> <unk> <unk> America at work , <unk> <unk> , and help <unk> global warming .
<unk> , a solution that we <unk> to solve our problems .
<unk> America . <unk> than that .
<unk> : This is the last one .
<unk> : <unk> : It 's about <unk> energy to America .
One of the most <unk> ways to <unk> from the <unk> that we <unk> our planet .
<unk> : The future is here . <unk> , <unk> , a new network .
<unk> <unk> two : <unk> <unk> for <unk> jobs .
<unk> : <unk> America . It 's time to be <unk> .
<unk> : A old <unk> <unk> says , " If you want to go <unk> , you go out to alone .
If you want to go away , you go together . "
We need to go away , quickly .
Thank you very much .
<unk> year at TED , I <unk> a <unk> on <unk> .
And we 're going to <unk> on how the car works .
So here . And for those that the other time , there were no , the <unk> is the largest scientific <unk> experiment ever <unk> -- <unk> miles of <unk> .
His task is to <unk> the conditions that were <unk> in the universe -- until the beginning of the universe -- until <unk> million times a second .
All that 's just <unk> .
This is the car under <unk> .
<unk> these <unk> <unk> in the <unk> .
This is what I work . It 's called <unk> -- it 's <unk> <unk> <unk> and has a <unk> <unk> .
This is a picture of <unk> in building so you can see the <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> last year we <unk> the car for the first time .
And this picture was <unk> by <unk> .
It was <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> .
It 's a picture of the first <unk> of particles that had been done the <unk> of the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , with a part of the <unk> , and <unk> particles inside the <unk> .
In other words , when you <unk> that image , 10 <unk> , you know , the car <unk> , which is a great <unk> .
I don 't know if it was this to <unk> <unk> , or this , when somebody <unk> on Google and <unk> that the page was this .
That means we had a <unk> impact beyond that scientific <unk> .
<unk> a week later , there was a problem with the car , we had a problem with the car , we had to these <unk> .
These <unk> <unk> <unk> when the car works at the <unk> <unk> .
Now , the <unk> between you to <unk> the <unk> and <unk> , " It 's not true . I 'm too <unk> . "
And instead of they can do it because when they 're very <unk> <unk> .
So , at least <unk> degrees , at a temperature <unk> at that of the space between stars , these <unk> can bring that <unk> .
In one of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , there was a <unk> <unk> .
So the <unk> <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
This was the result .
Now , this is more <unk> if you think that these <unk> <unk> <unk> , and that 's <unk> <unk> , and that 's <unk> about 30 <unk> .
They 're <unk> about 50 <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , what we did .
We <unk> them and <unk> .
Now , they 're all <unk> at their <unk> place .
<unk> the end of <unk> <unk> will be new <unk> .
We <unk> it , and we <unk> to get data to <unk> or <unk> , and we continue to find what are the <unk> that are the universe .
Now , of course , in a certain way , these <unk> <unk> the <unk> of science and engineering engineering engineering engineering <unk> . It 's easy to <unk> .
I think that 's so hard , the fact that it 's done , the fact that it 's value of things like <unk> .
I want to end with the words of a <unk> <unk> , which , <unk> , in <unk> of the <unk> experiments of his <unk> , his <unk> was Michael <unk> , he said , " No , it 's not so <unk> for the human mind that the ideas of human mind , that the ideas of science is <unk> , that there are no <unk> , that there are no new <unk> . "
Thank you .
I want to start <unk> to <unk> when , from children , <unk> with <unk> .
<unk> as <unk> and <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , actually , thinking and solve problems and <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> is <unk> <unk> to the way that we <unk> in the world around us .
So , from <unk> <unk> from the <unk> of our <unk> with <unk> objects , and my <unk> <unk> <unk> , and my <unk> <unk> <unk> , and I started <unk> , " And if we use a computer , instead of having the <unk> of the <unk> as a digital <unk> that <unk> that <unk> on a <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> on a <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> ,
and <unk> to our <unk> ?
The question was so interesting that we had to explore the answer , building the answer , building <unk> .
In a few words , a <unk> is a big computer as a <unk> .
In a few words , a <unk> is a big computer as a <unk> .
You can <unk> them with your hand , they can be <unk> in their own , and they have a screen and a <unk> radio .
But <unk> , they 're <unk> , like <unk> , you can just <unk> <unk> .
<unk> are the example of a new <unk> of tools to <unk> the digital information .
And as they become more <unk> , <unk> of the <unk> movement , of the other , and <unk> , and <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> , of how they can <unk> and <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
So , you know , you know ,
This <unk> is <unk> to show you video : if you <unk> it in a direction , the video <unk> so , if you go on on the other side .
These <unk> <unk> are <unk> of the other people .
If you <unk> them , you get <unk> to what they are going .
If they come up , they can <unk> it and they can <unk> a little bit .
If they come up , they can <unk> it and they can <unk> a little bit .
They also <unk> their movement and <unk> .
We 've got one of the interesting <unk> of the <unk> <unk> was that we could use common <unk> on data , to <unk> , to <unk> <unk> , and you know , " <unk> a color as a <unk> .
In this case , we have three <unk> <unk> as a <unk> <unk> of <unk> and I can <unk> it to <unk> in the central color in the central one , where you 're <unk> .
and I can <unk> it to <unk> the <unk> of color in the central one , where you get .
If you <unk> too , we can <unk> a little bit of a place .
I 'm also <unk> to <unk> , like <unk> , <unk> , what people can try and things that people can try things things , and they can <unk> the results .
Now , I 'm ...
This is a sequence of <unk> that I do with a <unk> program .
Here we have a game of words that is half between <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> , at every <unk> <unk> , <unk> a letter to each <unk> , <unk> , every <unk> <unk> , and every <unk> <unk> , and while I was <unk> <unk> in <unk> .
And then after about 30 seconds , you <unk> , and you have a new <unk> of <unk> and new possibilities to try .
Thank you .
Here 's a little bit of the children in <unk> <unk> , I made them so that I <unk> them and I <unk> a video .
They are very <unk> .
And one of the interesting things of this <unk> of <unk> is that you don 't have to give people a lot of <unk> .
<unk> just saying , " <unk> of the words , " and they know exactly what to do .
Here 's the other people who are <unk> .
This is our <unk> <unk> <unk> , over the right .
It really wanted to <unk> .
They were just <unk> , for him .
Now , this is a <unk> of a <unk> <unk> .
<unk> building a tool for the <unk> of the <unk> . He 's <unk> .
It can <unk> new characters in the scene , <unk> their <unk> .
It can <unk> new characters in the scene , <unk> their <unk> .
So , it 's going to get out the sun .
<unk> : The sun is <unk> .
David <unk> : Now , he brought a <unk> in the scene .
<unk> : The <unk> <unk> .
<unk> work ! Yeah !
So , we <unk> <unk> and <unk> can <unk> the characters --
<unk> : <unk> !
<unk> your story .
<unk> : <unk> !
<unk> : It 's a <unk> story , and it can decide how to <unk> it .
<unk> : It 's a <unk> story , and it can decide how to <unk> it .
<unk> : <unk> away , <unk> .
<unk> : The last example I have time to show you is a <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> music .
is a recent tool , <unk> , to <unk> and <unk> music .
The <unk> here is <unk> as a basic <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> of these have four different <unk> , and you can choose what to use .
You can also <unk> these <unk> in a sequence from <unk> to your <unk> .
And we just <unk> a <unk> <unk> , and a <unk> sequence . "
These are effects that you can control from live , like <unk> and <unk> .
And I <unk> it to a particular sound and then <unk> to <unk> .
And then there are the effects of time and <unk> , which <unk> to the whole sequence .
<unk> like this works .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> in a series , <unk> , the <unk> in a series , the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
Now , you 're going to take a low line .
<unk> : <unk> : Now , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> : And now I 'm going to <unk> the <unk> , so I can control the effect of the <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> : I can <unk> the whole sequence time by one side or the other .
<unk> : And now we <unk> the <unk> to give the bottom to <unk> <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> : I can <unk> the sequence of the flight .
So , I don 't have to <unk> before , but I can <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
And now , finally , I can <unk> the whole sequence <unk> on the left <unk> .
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is building new <unk> <unk> <unk> to how our brain works and body .
And today , I had time to show you one of the results of this path , and some possibilities that we try to bring out out of the lab .
And the concept that I want to <unk> is that 's <unk> this new generation of objects that we want .
Thank you very much .
I don 't see the time to talk to all of you .
I 'm a <unk> .
<unk> books is my <unk> , but it 's more than that , of course .
It 's also love and the <unk> of my life .
And I don 't look like that .
But , I said this , something particular has happened in my life and my career , which has led me to <unk> the whole relationship with this work .
The particular thing is that I <unk> wrote this book , this <unk> called " <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , " which , " which <unk> <unk> from my <unk> books , for some reason reason in the world and <unk> a big , <unk> <unk> .
And the result is everywhere <unk> , and people <unk> me as if I was <unk> .
<unk> -- <unk> , <unk> !
<unk> me , I 'm <unk> and say , " You don 't fear that be able to do better ?
You don 't fear to keep writing for all the life without able to be able to create a book that can <unk> to somebody ? "
that can <unk> to somebody ? "
It 's <unk> , you know .
But it could go worse , and then that I remember , over 20 years ago , when I was saying to people -- I was a <unk> -- I was a <unk> -- that I wanted to be a <unk> .
I 'm going to go to the same <unk> <unk> .
And people say , " Don 't <unk> to be able to be successful ?
You don 't fear that the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> ?
You don 't fear to do this <unk> for all the life without anything .
So , you know .
The answer -- the short answer to all these questions is , " Yeah . "
Yeah , I fear of all those things .
I always had fear .
And I 'm also afraid of many other things that people don 't have <unk> .
How <unk> and other things that are <unk> .
But , how much it 's about the <unk> what I thought and <unk> is why ?
Is it <unk> ?
It 's <unk> that anybody who 's <unk> to be <unk> by a job that you feel born .
But what is that particular in the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> about health <unk> <unk> in a way that other <unk> don 't do ?
So , my father was a <unk> <unk> and I didn 't remember one time in his 40 years of activity where he was asked if she was <unk> to be <unk> ?
It wasn 't -- that <unk> of the <unk> John , how did it ?
<unk> 't that <unk> , <unk> ?
<unk> , engineers like a group of course , in <unk> , <unk> , <unk> the <unk> of being <unk> <unk> .
We <unk> , we have enough this <unk> , and not only <unk> but <unk> of all these , we have this <unk> to be <unk> <unk> .
And we don 't want to look at the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> that , just in the <unk> century , <unk> young and often to their own .
And those who don 't have <unk> to be really <unk> by their <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , before she died , in the last <unk> , " <unk> my book <unk> <unk> , and he <unk> me a little bit more " <unk> <unk> about the work of their life .
But we didn 't know that when we had to say , because we 've heard these things so long , we have <unk> and <unk> the <unk> that creativity and <unk> that creativity and <unk> are in some <unk> and <unk> that art , finally , we <unk> to <unk> .
And the question I want to <unk> to all here is : you 're agree with this idea ?
So , you know , because it 's also <unk> by a <unk> distance to me , it doesn 't work for this <unk> .
I think it 's <unk> .
And I think it 's <unk> and I don 't want to <unk> <unk> in the next century .
I think it 's better <unk> our great <unk> to live .
And I certainly know that , in my case -- it would be very <unk> to start <unk> to <unk> to that <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> in which I 'm in my career .
<unk> -- look at it , I 'm pretty young , I have about 40 years .
I still have about four <unk> of work in me .
And it 's very <unk> that anything that will happen in now , then it 's going to be <unk> from the world as the work that we <unk> after the <unk> of my last book .
<unk> <unk> , because we 're all more or less friends here -- is <unk> that my greatest success is to my <unk> .
Oh , <unk> , <unk> , who thought !
You know this is the kind of thinking that leads a person to start <unk> at <unk> <unk> at the nine of the morning and I don 't want to do it .
I continue to do this work that I love .
So , the question is , how ?
And so it seems to me , after many <unk> , that the way to work to continue to write is what is to create a <unk> <unk> <unk> , right ?
I have to find a <unk> distance of security between me , which I 'm <unk> , and my natural <unk> on which <unk> to do . And as I was <unk> for all last year , <unk> <unk> , trying to find other society to see if you look at the time , trying to find other society to see if we had more <unk> and <unk> ideas .
about how to help people <unk> <unk> <unk> of creativity .
And that research has led me to the <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> because we were <unk> and then <unk> back .
<unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> -- people don 't believe that creativity <unk> <unk> of men , OK ?
It <unk> that creativity was this spirit <unk> <unk> and that <unk> to men from a few <unk> <unk> and <unk> , for reasons and <unk> and <unk> , for reasons and <unk> .
<unk> <unk> these <unk> <unk> of creativity " <unk> " creativity . "
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> to have a <unk> that <unk> <unk> from <unk> .
The <unk> were the same idea , but <unk> that kind of spirit of the spirit without a <unk> .
which is <unk> , because the <unk> didn 't really <unk> that a <unk> was a <unk> .
And I thought that a <unk> was this kind of <unk> <unk> that <unk> literally <unk> in the <unk> of a artist , a little bit like <unk> <unk> , and that <unk> out of <unk> the <unk> , and that <unk> out of that work .
<unk> <unk> <unk> , here is the distance of which I talk -- that <unk> <unk> <unk> you from the results of your work .
And everybody <unk> that was so <unk> , right ?
So , artists were <unk> by <unk> things , like , for example , too <unk> , right ?
If your work was <unk> , you didn 't know , you know , all of <unk> that <unk> state from this <unk> <unk> .
If your <unk> work , it wasn 't all <unk> , right ?
Everybody <unk> that was your <unk> to be a <unk> .
And so people <unk> <unk> creativity in <unk> for a lot of time .
And then the <unk> and <unk> all <unk> , and we <unk> this big idea ; we put the human <unk> on the universe above all and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> this big idea .
This was the principle of <unk> <unk> and people who were thinking that creativity <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And for the first time in history , <unk> to <unk> this or that artist as a <unk> <unk> that to a <unk> person with <unk> .
And I have to <unk> , I think it was a big <unk> .
I think you 're going to <unk> to someone , a simple person to believe that it 's like a <unk> , <unk> and <unk> and <unk> of all the <unk> <unk> , <unk> and <unk> and <unk> is a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
It 's like to ask somebody to <unk> the sun .
<unk> and <unk> the <unk> and create all these <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And I think it 's been this pressure to have <unk> artists in <unk> 500 years .
And , if that 's true , and I think that 's the question , the question becomes , and now ?
Can we do that <unk> ?
<unk> back to a more <unk> understanding of human relationship between humans and <unk> <unk> .
Or maybe no .
Maybe we can 't <unk> 500 years of thinking in a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And there 's probably people in the audience that <unk> <unk> <unk> on the <unk> of <unk> , <unk> , you do that <unk> people <unk> to <unk> their projects .
You probably don 't know all about this thing .
But the question I 'd like to <unk> is -- why ?
Why don 't you <unk> this way ?
Because it 's more sense of all the other thing that ever heard about to <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> process .
A process that , like anyone who ever <unk> to do something -- so , basically , everybody -- you know , you don 't know it .
And in fact , it can sometimes be completely <unk> .
I <unk> this <unk> <unk> with the amazing <unk> <unk> , who has now 90 years , but that 's been a <unk> for all life and said that during his <unk> <unk> , <unk> out in the <unk> <unk> , <unk> out in the <unk> <unk> , and we <unk> it , in the <unk> <unk> .
He said , it was like a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And that <unk> <unk> to her from the <unk> .
And he <unk> it , because he was <unk> the land under his feet .
We had one thing to have to do that point and was , words , " <unk> as a <unk> . "
And so they went to the home and was <unk> by this <unk> , and it wouldn 't have to do another paper and a <unk> <unk> enough <unk> , and <unk> on the page .
Sometimes they didn 't start to be fast , so <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and her <unk> and she would <unk> <unk> through and her <unk> and she would <unk> it through the <unk> , looking for , looking , as she said , " another <unk> . "
Then there were those times -- this piece never <unk> it -- there were no <unk> times when the was <unk> , was almost <unk> , right ?
So , was <unk> at home and was looking at home and the <unk> <unk> through , and <unk> a <unk> <unk> in the while he was <unk> , and then said , that was like , and then said , he was like , and then he was <unk> .
<unk> the <unk> from the tail and the <unk> in his body and the <unk> on the page .
And in these cases , the <unk> would be <unk> on the <unk> page and <unk> , but the <unk> , the last word to the first .
So when you <unk> it -- it 's <unk> , it 's exactly <unk> to my process .
Not all my <unk> process -- I 'm not a <unk> !
I 'm a <unk> , and my way of <unk> is ; I <unk> at the same <unk> every day and <unk> and work and work and <unk> over <unk> .
But even me in my <unk> , I <unk> against that , sometimes .
And I 'm sure a lot of you the <unk> .
You know , even if the work and ideas , I <unk> <unk> from a certain source , I wouldn 't have <unk> <unk> .
And what is this ?
And how can we <unk> it in a way we don 't have to <unk> your head , but rather , what would we do ?
So , as I 'm about , the best example I have is the <unk> <unk> <unk> , which I <unk> different years ago for a <unk> .
<unk> of this , and you know , <unk> , for the <unk> of life was the <unk> artist artist <unk> , trying to control , <unk> these species of <unk> <unk> .
But then <unk> , <unk> , and one day , and a day when he was <unk> on a <unk> <unk> , <unk> it all over to him .
<unk> <unk> , and everything of a <unk> <unk> this little <unk> of <unk> , who comes in his head as <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , and <unk> , and it wants , you know , it 's wonderful , and the <unk> , but it doesn 't know how to <unk> .
It 's not a piece of paper , it doesn 't have a <unk> .
So , you start to hear this kind of old <unk> <unk> in him , like , " I 'm going to lose , and <unk> <unk> from this song .
I 'm not <unk> enough , and I can 't <unk> . "
And instead of <unk> , they <unk> .
<unk> the whole <unk> process and made something completely new .
He just <unk> the sky and said , " <unk> , you don 't see you that I 'm <unk> ? "
" You know it can write a song now ?
If you really want to <unk> , you 're going to <unk> , you know , you know ,
<unk> , <unk> to <unk> <unk> another today .
<unk> <unk> <unk> . "
And his <unk> process after this .
Not the work , the work was still <unk> as always .
But the process , and the <unk> <unk> that <unk> was <unk> when he <unk> the <unk> , the <unk> that outside , the <unk> that he was <unk> , and he was <unk> back from where , he was <unk> that he didn 't have to be a <unk> thing and <unk> .
But <unk> this <unk> , wonderful <unk> <unk> <unk> a conversation between <unk> and this thing <unk> and <unk> that was not <unk> .
So , how much <unk> that story is to change a little bit of the way I <unk> and already <unk> me once .
This idea , I was <unk> when I was <unk> " <unk> , " and <unk> , " and <unk> in one of those <unk> <unk> in which we 're working on something and you can 't think that you can see that a <unk> , that 's going to be the <unk> book .
Not just <unk> , just <unk> book .
And we started thinking about <unk> this project .
But then I <unk> to <unk> that <unk> to the air and <unk> us .
So , I <unk> my face on the <unk> and <unk> my <unk> to a <unk> <unk> <unk> in the room .
And I said to <unk> <unk> , " What , " <unk> , what if this book is not going to be <unk> , you know ?
Because you see I 'm <unk> all that I have , I don 't have more of this .
So if you want that to be better , you have to <unk> and do your <unk> .
OK . But if you don 't do it , you know what , I don 't do it , you know what you do .
<unk> to write the same because it 's my work .
And I 'd like to <unk> that was <unk> that I 'm <unk> to do my part of " Because it 's so , finally , OK -- <unk> , <unk> does in the <unk> of Africa , <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the moon , <unk> music that we 're going to go to <unk> and hours to <unk> .
And they were always <unk> , because the <unk> were <unk> and were <unk> .
But every <unk> , <unk> , something <unk> , and one of these artists <unk> actually <unk> .
And I know you know what I talk , because I know you 've all seen , at a certain point , a <unk> .
It was like the time , and the <unk> <unk> through a kind of <unk> and <unk> and wasn 't doing anything different from usually , like the <unk> <unk> , but it was <unk> .
And a sudden , you know , you know , a human .
But it 's <unk> from the <unk> and <unk> in the <unk> <unk> .
And when this <unk> , at the time , people <unk> what was , he <unk> it with his name .
<unk> hands and <unk> to <unk> , " <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , God , "
That 's God , you know .
<unk> <unk> -- when the <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> , <unk> this <unk> with them and <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> " to " <unk> , " to " <unk> , " which you can still feel in <unk> or <unk> .
In <unk> , when a artist has done something impossible and <unk> , " <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> -- a <unk> of God .
And it 's <unk> because we need .
But , the problem comes the day after , for the <unk> , when you <unk> and <unk> that are 11 11 <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> that are 11 11 <unk> .
It 's just a <unk> with a lot of <unk> , and maybe never <unk> <unk> to that <unk> .
And maybe nobody <unk> the name of God still as <unk> , and what 's got to do with the rest of his life ?
It 's hard .
This is one of the most <unk> <unk> to do in a <unk> life .
But maybe it doesn 't have to be so <unk> if you don 't believe , <unk> , <unk> , that the <unk> of your being being being being being being being <unk> .
But I 'm just going to <unk> that you get data in <unk> from a source of this <unk> part of your life that you have to go to <unk> when you finished .
And , you know , if we think that 's all about this .
And so I started to <unk> , and it 's certainly like I <unk> it for several months in the <unk> of the book that I was <unk> , the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> of my success <unk> .
And what I must continue to <unk> when I feel <unk> from this is , I don 't fear .
<unk> : Don 't <unk> your work .
<unk> to <unk> your <unk> , any <unk> , any <unk> .
If your work is <unk> , <unk> .
If the <unk> , you 're going to <unk> <unk> <unk> some kind of <unk> , for a few <unk> of <unk> , for just a moment through your <unk> , then you know , " <unk> ! "
<unk> , you do the same <unk> .
And " <unk> ! " <unk> ! " <unk> .
I think , and I think , you know ,
" <unk> ! " <unk> ! " <unk> , even for <unk> <unk> <unk> . "
Thank you .
Thank you .
<unk> <unk> : <unk> !
You know , I 've been talking about some of these projects on the human genome , what can <unk> and about new genes .
We 're <unk> a new path : we started <unk> biology and now start <unk> , and now start from that digital code in a new <unk> of biology , <unk> and <unk> .
We always tried to <unk> great questions .
" <unk> is the life ? " It 's something that many <unk> , I think have <unk> to various levels .
We tried different <unk> , <unk> to the <unk> terms .
We 're <unk> by almost 20 years .
When we <unk> the human genome <unk> to go from the world of the digital biology world .
Now , we can <unk> the life , or create new life from this digital universe ?
This is the map of a little <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , which is the species from the <unk> genome in the <unk> .
And we tried to reduce the genome to <unk> a little bit smaller .
We can <unk> a <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the
But when we take a look at his <unk> map , it 's very simple than our .
<unk> , this is simple .
But when we look at all the genes that we can <unk> , one at the time , is very <unk> that this can bring to a <unk> cell .
So , I thought the only way to <unk> was <unk> this <unk> <unk> in a way to <unk> <unk> the <unk> to <unk> some of these questions .
And so we started the <unk> of " We can <unk> a <unk> ? "
Can we have the chemistry to produce these big molecules that we never have been able to create before ?
And , in case , we can make a <unk> ?
A <unk> is just a piece of <unk> material .
The speed that we 're able to <unk> the life is <unk> to <unk> <unk> .
Our <unk> <unk> code , instead of <unk> <unk> , but it 's <unk> .
And our <unk> <unk> <unk> .
We <unk> over 15 years ago .
The process has <unk> a lot of <unk> , <unk> with a <unk> <unk> before we <unk> the early experiments .
But we found that <unk> of DNA is very hard .
There are <unk> of thousands of cars in the world that <unk> little DNA , <unk> of 30 to 50 <unk> and <unk> and it 's a <unk> process : the <unk> is a <unk> process : the <unk> is <unk> , more <unk> .
So we had to develop a new <unk> to <unk> these <unk> and <unk> the <unk> .
And this was our first <unk> , starting to go from digital information of <unk> <unk> <unk> .
It 's a little virus that we can see .
We designed the <unk> , we <unk> the <unk> and <unk> a DNA of the <unk> and <unk> of DNA <unk> .
The interesting part is when we took this piece of <unk> material and we <unk> it in bacteria , and we <unk> it in bacteria , the bacteria have <unk> to read this code and <unk> .
<unk> particles are <unk> by cells , are <unk> by cells , and they <unk> the <unk> <unk> .
I talked about recently with the <unk> <unk> industry that they have <unk> this model .
They have more than you .
<unk> that is a situation where software can really build its own own <unk> in a <unk> system .
But we wanted to do the biggest things in big .
We wanted to build the whole <unk> of <unk> .
They 're more than <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
So we thought of <unk> in the size of the <unk> <unk> , so we can change the <unk> to understand what the <unk> of a <unk> cell .
<unk> is <unk> , and if you <unk> information in a computer , these have to be very <unk> .
When we <unk> this genome for the first time in <unk> , the <unk> <unk> was of a <unk> for every 10 <unk> .
We found , <unk> , 30 <unk> . If we used that original sequence , you could never be able to do it .
A process of the process is to design <unk> 50 <unk> that <unk> with all the other <unk> <unk> of 50 <unk> to build smaller <unk> that together .
<unk> elements here .
You probably read that that <unk> <unk> .
<unk> : We have a <unk> code on four <unk> : <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> and <unk>
<unk> of those <unk> <unk> together , about 20 <unk> , and there 's a <unk> order to <unk> every <unk> .
So we can use the code for <unk> words , <unk> .
What we did at the beginning was <unk> .
Some of them were <unk> by the fact that it wasn 't <unk> .
We designed these <unk> to <unk> <unk> with <unk> .
There are <unk> that <unk> them and <unk> <unk> them .
And we started <unk> <unk> <unk> .
But at every step , we made these <unk> in <unk> so that we 're <unk> to create a very <unk> <unk> , which we 're going to create a very <unk> <unk> , you 'll see in a minute .
We 're trying to <unk> the process .
So this seems the <unk> of a <unk> <unk> .
When you go to these <unk> <unk> , more than 100 <unk> <unk> , <unk> , they don 't get <unk> directly in the <unk> <unk> .
You get to the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> biology .
So we <unk> other <unk> .
<unk> of another <unk> called <unk> <unk> , which in biology <unk> to <unk> the DNA that can <unk> the DNA .
Here 's a example .
This <unk> , called <unk> <unk> , can <unk> three million <unk> of <unk> .
You can see in the <unk> <unk> as his <unk> <unk> .
<unk> 12 hours , it 's <unk> exactly like it was before .
<unk> thousands of organisms that are able to do that .
These organisms can be completely <unk> .
We 're going to live under <unk> .
I 'm absolutely sure that life <unk> in space , and <unk> to find new <unk> of water <unk> .
And to say , NASA 's showed that this is .
This is a picture of the <unk> that we built these <unk> , just using these <unk> , just using the <unk> <unk> design <unk> .
<unk> <unk> them .
This image was not <unk> with a <unk> <unk> , but with a <unk> <unk> .
It 's so great that we can <unk> with a <unk> <unk> .
These are pictures that <unk> a period of about six seconds .
This is the <unk> that we 've done a little time ago .
They 're more than <unk> <unk> code .
It 's the largest <unk> of a <unk> <unk> ever <unk> from man .
It has a <unk> <unk> <unk> to 300 million .
If you <unk> it with a 10 <unk> without spaces , we <unk> it just <unk> pages to <unk> this code .
Now , how do we make it work ?
<unk> , through a virus is a <unk> <unk> .
It 's a little bit more <unk> when you use of bacteria .
It 's even easier when it 's about <unk> cells as our : you can just <unk> the <unk> and <unk> another , which is that basically the process of <unk> .
In <unk> , we <unk> the <unk> is instead of <unk> in the cell , but we have <unk> <unk> that we 're able to make a <unk> <unk> <unk> from a cell to another and <unk> .
We <unk> a <unk> <unk> from a kind of <unk> .
The two are different than men from <unk> .
We <unk> some <unk> in more <unk> , that we could decide what to do for this <unk> .
<unk> <unk> with <unk> <unk> .
And when we put it in the cell was <unk> and <unk> our <unk> <unk> the new <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , the new <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> ,
And <unk> <unk> that we didn 't go beyond , but we tried to <unk> over there .
This is one of the major <unk> of evolution .
We found that <unk> species have <unk> a second or a third <unk> <unk> in a <unk> <unk> of them in a second thousands of new <unk> to that species .
So who think evolution as a only <unk> at the time you <unk> , at the biology .
<unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> that was in the cell didn 't have one .
The <unk> <unk> we <unk> it .
It 's <unk> , and it <unk> the other <unk> as <unk> material , has <unk> , and we <unk> with just the cell and the new <unk> .
has become blue because of the genes that we <unk> .
And in a short <unk> of time , all the <unk> of time , all the <unk> of the <unk> of the new software , and it 's <unk> of all in a new software , which we <unk> in the cell software .
All the <unk> are <unk> , the <unk> are <unk> , and when you <unk> the code that we <unk> it .
Now , this could be <unk> <unk> , but we <unk> the software , but we can change things in a <unk> <unk> .
Now , I 've already <unk> that here is not about <unk> -- but of progress , <unk> by <unk> three million years and a half of evolution , and I already said that maybe we 're going to create a new version of the <unk> <unk> that we 're <unk> new <unk> on this process .
Why do that ?
I think it 's pretty <unk> when we think about our <unk> .
We 're going to go from six billion and a half of people in the next 40 years .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> .
Now there are three people on the planet to <unk> <unk> ; in 40 years , there will be four .
We 're <unk> problems now to find food , water <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> for six billion and a half and a half of people .
We 're going to be <unk> for nine billion .
<unk> <unk> than five billion <unk> , over 30 billion <unk> of <unk> .
That means 100 million <unk> a day .
When we try to find <unk> <unk> , or any kind of process to <unk> , it will be a huge challenge .
We have to realize that we have all of CO2 <unk> from these materials that <unk> in the atmosphere .
And so , we have a <unk> <unk> in the whole world , we have a <unk> with about 20 million genes , and I like to think that are the <unk> <unk> for the future .
The <unk> industry only a <unk> of <unk> , and think about how many different things are out .
Our <unk> is <unk> data from the reality of <unk> and our imagination .
Now we have <unk> , thank you to these <unk> <unk> , able to create what we call <unk> <unk> .
We can build a big robot that can produce a big robot that can produce a million <unk> a day .
Think about <unk> these 20 million genes or <unk> to <unk> the <unk> to produce <unk> or <unk> , new <unk> , we can change , <unk> , new <unk> , we can change , thank you to a small team , and create more biology now that in the last 20 years of science .
And it 's just a standard <unk> .
We can choose to <unk> , <unk> <unk> , chemistry or <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
This is a <unk> of some software software <unk> that we 're working on to be able to <unk> and design species to computers .
Well , we don 't know how they will be .
We know exactly what their <unk> code is .
Now we 're <unk> on the <unk> of the <unk> generation .
You 've seen <unk> from the <unk> <unk> was a <unk> <unk> experiment .
We 've got <unk> second and third generation that we had enough enough <unk> , <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> of <unk> .
But the only way that biology can have a big impact without <unk> <unk> the cost of food and <unk> <unk> , would be <unk> CO2 in matter , which we 're working on cells , so we 're working on to <unk> cells that can get this purpose , and we think we can have the first <unk> of <unk> <unk> in about 18 months .
<unk> light <unk> with CO2 is a <unk> , but in our <unk> <unk> in the world , we found different <unk> .
This is a <unk> that we <unk> in <unk> .
<unk> in the ocean , at about <unk> meters of <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> from CO2 using hydrogen <unk> as hydrogen energy .
We 're trying to understand whether we can <unk> CO2 , which can be <unk> by <unk> <unk> , <unk> that CO2 in <unk> , to drive this process .
So , we think we might be able to <unk> what the basic question is that what the basic question is that what is is . We , we <unk> the <unk> goal of <unk> the whole industry .
<unk> . If you can 't do that from TED , where can you ?
It 's going to be a main source of energy .
<unk> , we 're working on to use the same <unk> to create <unk> .
You saw this year with the flu , we always go back to a year and with a dollar in less when it comes back the <unk> .
I think that 's what you can change building <unk> in <unk> .
So , what the future could start to look at <unk> , now , the tree of evolution , <unk> <unk> , and finally <unk> cells .
We 're so much <unk> people .
Our purpose is to make a <unk> enough <unk> to try to <unk> . Thank you very much .
<unk> of all , I 'm going to show you , the <unk> , some of the new technology that we brought up to <unk> to a <unk> <unk> almost a year ago . This is <unk> .
It 's a <unk> where you can <unk> is <unk> <unk> with a huge amount of data that <unk> with a huge amount of data .
Here we 're seeing <unk> <unk> of pictures with a kind of <unk> <unk> and <unk> , for a <unk> <unk> , <unk> the images as we want .
And it doesn 't matter how big the amount of information that we see , how big are these <unk> of data or images .
Most of them are common pictures , but this is a <unk> <unk> from the <unk> of the <unk> , and <unk> in the <unk> of 300 <unk> .
It doesn 't make any difference because the only thing that <unk> the <unk> of a system like this is the number of <unk> on your screen in any moment . It 's also a lot of <unk> architecture .
This is a whole book , example of data , <unk> .
This is <unk> <unk> <unk> . Every <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And to <unk> that 's about the text and not images , we can do something like that , to see that it 's about a real <unk> of the text , not of a picture .
It could be a little bit <unk> to read a <unk> book .
You don 't <unk> it .
This is a <unk> example . It 's a <unk> number of <unk> .
Every image is the beginning of a <unk> .
And it really gives you the pleasure experience and the <unk> experience of a <unk> or a <unk> , which is for nature a <unk> <unk> , which is for nature a <unk> <unk> .
We also did something with the corner of this <unk> number in particular <unk> .
We created a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , much more <unk> than the one that you uses in a normal <unk> and we <unk> of the <unk> content .
If you want to see the <unk> of this <unk> <unk> , you can see here .
Or other models , or even <unk> <unk> .
And this really <unk> some of these ideas to <unk> the <unk> of space on the screen .
So , we thought this is going to put in the <unk> and other <unk> , not <unk> to be <unk> .
Of course , the <unk> is one of the most <unk> <unk> for this kind of technology .
And on this , I don 't want to lose time , if we don 't say that we have <unk> to give you a <unk> <unk> .
These are all the streets in the United States <unk> over the United States .
So I 'm going to start to something else .
This is actually <unk> in the Web ; you can see it .
This is a project called <unk> , which <unk> two different technologies .
A <unk> is <unk> and the other is a very interesting research computer that was made by <unk> <unk> , a student of Washington , with help to <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> . It 's <unk> <unk> . It 's <unk> . It 's <unk> . It 's <unk> . <unk> .
And it 's alive on the Web , <unk> <unk> .
You can see when we do this kind of <unk> , where we can go from an image to the other and have this kind of experience to <unk> .
But the <unk> of the images here has actually a meaning .
<unk> <unk> <unk> in the computer have <unk> these pictures , so that we <unk> to <unk> places that <unk> that <unk> all <unk> <unk> <unk> on the <unk> <unk> <unk> on the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> on the <unk> <unk> <unk> , and these things are all <unk> <unk> .
I don 't know if I have time to show you some other environment .
There are much more <unk> .
I want to go directly to one of the <unk> of the <unk> data and this <unk> <unk> <unk> that we 've done for the first time , I 'm going to show you what we did is really the key behind this technology , the <unk> technology . And it 's not <unk> as <unk> as we 're looking at the website .
We had to <unk> <unk> and <unk> and forth .
This is a <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> images from <unk> . <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> and <unk> and <unk> images of <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> . We 're saying . We 're going to this model .
So , all of these <unk> images and have been all <unk> <unk> at the <unk> level in this way .
And it 's possible to <unk> this way .
You know , I never thought of end up to work for <unk> .
It 's very <unk> <unk> this kind of <unk> here .
I think you 're going to see that 's about a lot of different <unk> of <unk> : <unk> <unk> <unk> , a number , <unk> in this environment .
And if I can , I <unk> to look at those <unk> .
A lot of them are <unk> , etc .
<unk> a few of here is a series of photographs -- <unk> .
This is a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
We can go from the physics of this environment .
The <unk> is that we can do with the <unk> . This is now <unk> data from the whole memory of how to <unk> the land , from the whole memory of view and <unk> all of that data .
All of those pictures become <unk> together , and more than the <unk> of the parts .
You have a model of the whole <unk> .
Think about this as the <unk> of the work of <unk> <unk> on Earth .
It 's something that <unk> in <unk> complexity as people who are <unk> , and the <unk> that you 're going to <unk> with the use .
Their pictures are <unk> with <unk> <unk> from other people .
If somebody 's been the idea of <unk> all these <unk> <unk> , my <unk> picture of the <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> of all those data <unk> , and I can use it as a <unk> to <unk> in that space , using the <unk> of <unk> in that space , using the <unk> of everybody else , and have a social experience and <unk> .
Of course , a <unk> of all of this is very <unk> models of every interesting part of the land , <unk> , <unk> not just by <unk> <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> .
Thank you very much .
Chris Anderson : I realized that ? What your software is going to be able to do is that at a point , in the next years , all the pictures , all the <unk> of the world will be <unk> <unk> ?
<unk> : Yeah . What 's doing is basically <unk> .
It 's creating <unk> , if you want , between images .
And it 's <unk> it at the <unk> of the <unk> of the images .
And what it becomes very interesting if you think about the <unk> of information <unk> that many of these images .
As you do a <unk> <unk> and the web of images , you <unk> a <unk> and the text on the web has a lot of information about images .
Now , what happens if that picture is <unk> to all your picture ?
So , the amount of <unk> <unk> and the amount of <unk> that is really huge . It 's a <unk> effect . It 's a <unk> effect .
CA : <unk> , it 's really incredible .
<unk> : I 'm going to <unk> you .
One of the main <unk> when you <unk> and one of the <unk> research is that we can live in who has no <unk> <unk> , who didn 't <unk> the <unk> <unk> , and we <unk> it in the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> , we <unk> it in the <unk> of plants .
<unk> thinking that <unk> <unk> <unk> , and that the idea that the <unk> of <unk> <unk> , or that <unk> are still <unk> <unk> , or <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , to remember the <unk> of <unk> , and that the idea that the idea that we live in which we don 't have any <unk> , but it 's just a <unk> of reality , but it 's just a <unk> of reality , but it is just a <unk> of reality ,
the <unk> of a particular <unk> of <unk> choices that our <unk> has done , good or <unk> , many <unk> .
And of course , all of the <unk> <unk> .
Everybody <unk> . <unk> .
We are <unk> <unk> .
We need to deal with the death of death , so we don 't <unk> it and <unk> --
We all have a art .
What <unk> is the <unk> of the song , the <unk> of <unk> of every culture .
It doesn 't matter that are the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> , or the <unk> of <unk> <unk> , or the <unk> of <unk> <unk> , or a <unk> in the heart of <unk> .
He 's been my <unk> of journey in <unk> a month ago , or a <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> mother 's mother 's <unk> .
All of these <unk> <unk> that there are other ways of <unk> other ways of thinking , other ways of moving in the world .
And if you look at a moment , it 's a concept that can give you hope .
<unk> , the <unk> of the world create a <unk> of the world , and <unk> that <unk> the planet and is important for the <unk> of the planet , as the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And you can think of this <unk> <unk> as a <unk> and you can <unk> the <unk> of all the <unk> , dreams , <unk> , <unk> , ideas , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> in being from the human imagination .
<unk> is the fantastic <unk> of humanity .
It 's the <unk> of what we are and what we can be as as <unk> species .
And <unk> the <unk> has been <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , for example , <unk> that 50 percent of all the species has been or is on the <unk> of the <unk> , because it 's <unk> , or -- in the <unk> <unk> -- and you don 't even even even even <unk> <unk> -- that of the diversity .
The <unk> of that is , of course , the <unk> <unk> .
When you 're <unk> <unk> on this planet .
A language is not just <unk> by a <unk> or a series of rules .
A language is the <unk> of the spirit .
It 's the <unk> that the <unk> of every culture comes in the material world .
Every language is a forest of the mind , a <unk> , a <unk> of a <unk> <unk> .
And of those <unk> <unk> , while we 're here in <unk> , at least half the <unk> of the children .
They don 't get more <unk> to children , which means , unless you do something , which they 're dead .
What 's more <unk> of being <unk> by the <unk> , of being the last to talk to a language , and not <unk> the way to <unk> the <unk> of <unk> or <unk> the <unk> of <unk> <unk> or <unk> the <unk> of <unk> ?
This <unk> <unk> was a few of somebody in the world every two weeks , two weeks : every two weeks , a <unk> <unk> and door with <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And I know that somebody of you will be " not better ? "
The world wouldn 't be a better place if we <unk> all the same language ? " <unk> , then we all <unk> .
<unk> <unk> .
<unk> of a <unk> thing is that that you can 't talk about their language .
Today , I 'd like to give you a journey through the <unk> --
a little journey in <unk> to give you a <unk> of what we 're <unk> .
Many of us <unk> that when I say " different ways of <unk> <unk> . " I mean different ways of <unk> .
<unk> for example , this <unk> <unk> , in <unk> <unk> , which <unk> <unk> <unk> , which <unk> to the <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
It 's a <unk> that 's not able to <unk> the blue color from the green because the <unk> is <unk> in the forest time , where we <unk> the <unk> .
They have a <unk> language and a <unk> rule , <unk> " <unk> <unk> " : you have to <unk> a different person .
And all of that <unk> in the past <unk> , but the <unk> is that in these families that you 're talking six or seven <unk> because of <unk> <unk> nobody 's <unk> .
You 're going to hear and then you start talking about .
<unk> one of the most interesting <unk> that I 've lived with , the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , a incredible <unk> that had the first <unk> in <unk> .
In <unk> , five <unk> have <unk> <unk> <unk> .
They made <unk> from the top pictures that <unk> them in <unk> that <unk> <unk> , <unk> that this <unk> of the <unk> forest had never seen anything <unk> .
They <unk> the <unk> <unk> , and they have <unk> to <unk> a shape or a <unk> and , they don 't <unk> , nothing , they have <unk> that <unk> <unk> , and they <unk> the five <unk> with <unk> .
But <unk> didn 't just <unk> the <unk> .
They <unk> between them .
<unk> percent <unk> was <unk> by their own own .
We 've been <unk> at eight <unk> and we found two <unk> of death and when we <unk> to know , they have <unk> that one of them was so <unk> that he died , and then they <unk> it . And then they <unk> it . And then they had a incredible knowledge of the forest .
<unk> were able to recognize the animal <unk> from 40 <unk> and <unk> the species .
<unk> <unk> years old 80 , I was <unk> a very interesting job when my <unk> <unk> <unk> , if my <unk> <unk> to go to <unk> in <unk> , <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> .
For a sense of <unk> , I should have understand the <unk> culture and that the <unk> is not <unk> <unk> .
It 's pretty a <unk> view of the world 's <unk> .
Very interesting .
If you 're going to <unk> the great <unk> of the world , what would you <unk> ?
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , etc . .
A continent has always left out , thinking that <unk> Africa doesn 't have <unk> <unk> . And instead and <unk> is not another that the <unk> of these <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> .
What makes the <unk> is the <unk> of the <unk> of life and death .
So <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> can be <unk> by the <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> and <unk> to the <unk> of the live in such a <unk> <unk> .
So , the <unk> <unk> , " <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> go to <unk> <unk> .
We <unk> in <unk> and <unk> God . "
And from the moment that you 're <unk> , is the spirit that you can <unk> you , how can you <unk> ?
So , you start to these incredible events : <unk> <unk> in the state of <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a pretty <unk> of the power of the body when it was <unk> in a state of <unk> <unk> .
<unk> all the <unk> that I 've lived with the most <unk> are the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> , in the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> of the <unk> civilization that once <unk> on the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> on the <unk> <unk> .
In a <unk> continent of blood , this <unk> never been <unk> by <unk> .
<unk> <unk> today are <unk> by a <unk> , but their education is extraordinary .
<unk> young <unk> are <unk> by families to three or four years , and they live in a world <unk> and <unk> in a world <unk> and <unk> in <unk> <unk> <unk> for 18 years .
Two <unk> of nine years <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
For all this time , they 're <unk> to the values of their society , values that their <unk> and <unk> their <unk> <unk> -- or to <unk> the <unk> <unk> -- or to say the <unk> <unk> .
And then , this incredible <unk> , they get <unk> out and for the first time in life , at the age of 18 , they see a <unk> . And in that moment of the first <unk> <unk> , when the sun <unk> <unk> <unk> , all that they have learned in theory is <unk> in theory , all that they have learned in theory is <unk> in theory , and it 's <unk> :
" <unk> ? <unk> how I said I said .
It 's <unk> . Now it 's <unk> . "
They call it the <unk> and they say that we , <unk> <unk> , we are the <unk> of the world .
This level of <unk> is extremely important .
When we think about <unk> and <unk> environment , and the <unk> <unk> <unk> , which is a <unk> concept in its <unk> or maybe <unk> <unk> and <unk> and say that these <unk> are <unk> to the Earth .
<unk> <unk> are not <unk> or <unk> by <unk> .
There 's no space for these things in the <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> of the <unk> , but thank you at time and <unk> , they have created a <unk> of the Earth <unk> , and they have a <unk> of the Earth , it can live because it 's <unk> by human <unk> .
What does that mean ?
You might say that a <unk> of the <unk> that <unk> <unk> that the mountain is a <unk> spirit that <unk> its <unk> will be a different human being <unk> and <unk> and will have a <unk> different <unk> and will be a different <unk> , and it 's going to be <unk> .
That 's the <unk> of a spirit or a <unk> <unk> is <unk> .
What 's interesting is that <unk> the <unk> between the <unk> and the natural world .
I grew up in the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> to be <unk> .
And that has been a human being different from my friends who believe that <unk> are the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> <unk> that live in the <unk> <unk> and <unk> that live in the <unk> <unk> in the world , <unk> that we <unk> in the <unk> <unk> .
If you start to <unk> that these <unk> can create different , <unk> , we start to understand some of them <unk> . We wanted to understand some of them .
I <unk> this picture in <unk> in <unk> <unk> .
Maybe some of you have heard about the <unk> , the most powerful <unk> of the <unk> <unk> .
What makes the <unk> is not the potential <unk> of the <unk> , but his <unk> . It 's <unk> by two elements .
On one side , this <unk> <unk> that has a series of <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
<unk> the only <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> a little bit <unk> that <unk> , but it 's <unk> with the <unk> of a <unk> 's family <unk> .
This <unk> <unk> <unk> , very similar to the <unk> , <unk> .
If you 're going to see the <unk> <unk> <unk> for the <unk> that they do from a different <unk> of species , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> that <unk> on the <unk> is a little bit like being <unk> by a <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> on a sea of electricity . [ <unk> ] [ <unk> ] [ <unk> ] [ <unk> ] [ <unk> ] . ] It doesn 't create a <unk> of the reality .
I often <unk> with my <unk> , Richard <unk> <unk> , the man who <unk> was <unk> , with his discovery of <unk> in the ' <unk> .
My <unk> is not <unk> these <unk> as <unk> because if you 're done , you can 't tell nobody to be <unk> . [ <unk> ] [ <unk> ] [ <unk> ] [ <unk> ] [ <unk> ] [ <unk> ] ] [ <unk> ] . ]
It 's possible to be <unk> by <unk> with other <unk> <unk> that <unk> .
Now it 's the <unk> : the <unk> that are in this <unk> are <unk> of <unk> , the same <unk> to <unk> the <unk> . The question <unk> <unk> : in a <unk> of <unk> species of plants , how do these <unk> <unk> , they <unk> , but if you <unk> in this way , they create a <unk> version that is <unk> <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> of the parts ?
We use the great <unk> of the <unk> and <unk> , which can <unk> .
But if you look at the <unk> , we <unk> " <unk> " <unk> " <unk> " <unk> " <unk> " . "
What does that mean ?
This <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , which <unk> <unk> in the forest , and that our eyes <unk> in the forest species .
If you <unk> how they <unk> their <unk> <unk> , " <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , of the rest of them ? " I said , " No . "
The solution is : they take the <unk> <unk> in a night night , <unk> <unk> and <unk> with a different <unk> .
With this , you don 't have to <unk> , but it 's much more interesting than <unk> <unk> .
Now , [ <unk> ] the problem is that the ones of us that have to heart <unk> <unk> them , but somehow <unk> to <unk> the <unk> of history , and <unk> .
In fact , the <unk> century , in 300 years , not <unk> <unk> for his <unk> or his <unk> <unk> , but rather like it was where we <unk> and <unk> or <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> of diversity of <unk> and <unk> of the planet . Now , the problem is not the change .
All <unk> through the <unk> have been <unk> in a <unk> for new possibilities .
And the problem is not technology .
<unk> <unk> have no <unk> to be <unk> when they <unk> <unk> and <unk> as the <unk> have <unk> and <unk> as the <unk> have <unk> when they put <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
It 's not the change or technology that <unk> the <unk> of <unk> . It 's power .
The <unk> <unk> .
And if you look at the world , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know ,
They 're <unk> creatures and <unk> <unk> out of the <unk> forces that go beyond their <unk> <unk> .
<unk> that <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of <unk> --
a <unk> <unk> <unk> , where you can see the <unk> <unk> , a <unk> that has been <unk> in the forest to a generation ago , and now <unk> to the <unk> and <unk> on the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , where you can see the river <unk> <unk> by the <unk> <unk> <unk> , where the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , where the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , where the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> ,
We started <unk> the <unk> with the <unk> <unk> in the forest .
Or , in the case of <unk> , are the diseases that are <unk> with the <unk> discovery .
If you <unk> on the <unk> of the <unk> , where I 'm doing a lot of research , you 'll see the <unk> of politics .
As <unk> the <unk> , the physics of a <unk> , is <unk> at a <unk> level , but the <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> of a <unk> , not only is <unk> , but <unk> <unk> in certain <unk> , because it 's <unk> of the development .
And you can 't understand the <unk> of the <unk> until you go from the beginning .
I <unk> the <unk> miles from <unk> in the <unk> China through the <unk> <unk> , <unk> with a young <unk> , but just <unk> to <unk> with a young <unk> , but just <unk> to <unk> what 's behind .
<unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> million people <unk> from the <unk> during the <unk> <unk> .
The father 's been <unk> at the <unk> <unk> .
which means that it 's been <unk> at the time of Chinese <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> mother was <unk> and her <unk> was to be <unk> .
It 's brought to <unk> in <unk> at the age of two years <unk> under his <unk> , because she couldn 't have no <unk> .
The <unk> , who did the same , was <unk> in <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> a <unk> <unk> and , for this <unk> , was <unk> to the <unk> <unk> for seven years .
The pain of <unk> can be <unk> , but the spirit of the <unk> of the <unk> is <unk> .
And then , all you <unk> to a choice .
<unk> live in the <unk> world or we want to <unk> the world of diversity ?
The great <unk> <unk> <unk> , before die of <unk> said that his greatest fear was that , in our <unk> <unk> vision of the world , not only <unk> the whole <unk> of human imagination , <unk> to a <unk> <unk> of human imagination , but a day , a day we <unk> <unk> that there were other possibilities .
And it 's <unk> to remember that our species is <unk> for <unk> years .
The <unk> <unk> , who has given us , and <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> with <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> , and we talk about <unk> years ago .
The <unk> world has <unk> 300 years .
That <unk> story , I didn 't know that we have the answers to all the challenges that we had the answers to come .
When we <unk> these <unk> of the world 's <unk> what it means to be human , <unk> with <unk> different <unk> .
And it 's in these answers that we all <unk> the possibility of being what we are : a <unk> species , which has to <unk> that all the <unk> and all the <unk> can <unk> . And there are great moments of <unk> .
I <unk> this picture on the <unk> <unk> of <unk> , when I went to <unk> <unk> with <unk> , and this man , <unk> , and this man , <unk> , <unk> me the wonderful story of his <unk> .
The government <unk> was not always <unk> with the <unk> <unk> and in the ' <unk> to <unk> our <unk> , we <unk> them in <unk> .
The <unk> of this man <unk> <unk> .
The family , <unk> for his life , the <unk> away , and all his <unk> .
You want to know that <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> .
The <unk> of <unk> were made of <unk> fish in <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> of this man didn 't <unk> by the night or <unk> <unk> .
It 's <unk> away , it 's <unk> the <unk> <unk> and <unk> in your hand . When I did it <unk> , he <unk> it , he 's <unk> , he 's <unk> , he 's <unk> <unk> , he 's <unk> , he 's <unk> the <unk> .
He has <unk> <unk> on the <unk> of this <unk> <unk> and when <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> a dog .
He <unk> the dog and created a <unk> , with the <unk> <unk> has created a <unk> , has <unk> , and <unk> on the <unk> , <unk> <unk> in <unk> .
<unk> to talk about <unk> with anything ? [ <unk> ] And this , in different ways , [ <unk> ] <unk> ] and all the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> and all the <unk> <unk> of the world .
<unk> <unk> the government <unk> to <unk> the <unk> of a <unk> area of <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> together .
It 's their new <unk> . It 's called <unk> .
It 's a <unk> <unk> . We <unk> all the resources .
One <unk> of how a <unk> can <unk> with his <unk> .
And , finally , I think it 's pretty <unk> at least at least who 's been in these areas of the planet , we realize that they 're not <unk> at all .
For somebody 's home .
<unk> <unk> of the human imagination that <unk> to the <unk> of the time . And for us all , the dreams of these children , like our children , they become part of the <unk> hope .
So , we <unk> <unk> <unk> we are <unk> that <unk> never <unk> .
<unk> that <unk> --
[ <unk> ] are not <unk> , but we believe that stories can change the world , and maybe we are the best <unk> to tell the stories of the world . Every month our website <unk> million <unk> .
<unk> <unk> our <unk> <unk> .
Our <unk> are <unk> by millions of people .
Our work is <unk> in <unk> to bring our audience in places to <unk> <unk> that <unk> from which <unk> <unk> from which they <unk> from how and , they saw it , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , and we have to find a <unk> of life in a <unk> and <unk> . We need to find a <unk> <unk> in a <unk> world and <unk> . And we need to find a <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
where the <unk> of all the <unk> can <unk> our <unk> <unk> .
Thank you .
I 'm going to talk about some things that I 've written in this book that you 've already heard of and you 've already heard and <unk> some <unk> , in case you don 't <unk> them .
I want to start with what I call " the <unk> <unk> . "
<unk> <unk> of what ?
The <unk> <unk> of all the society <unk> <unk> . The <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> : " If we want to <unk> our citizens . " The way to do it is <unk> freedom . "
The reason is , on one side , in fact that freedom is in itself a value , it 's <unk> , <unk> , <unk> for humans .
<unk> is what we 're <unk> , if we <unk> , each of us can act for all that we <unk> our <unk> , without no one that we <unk> our own own own .
The way to <unk> the freedom is to <unk> the choice .
<unk> people have , more <unk> , and more <unk> is their freedom , and greater is their freedom ,
This is <unk> , <unk> , it 's so <unk> <unk> in society that nobody <unk> <unk> in <unk> .
And it 's also <unk> <unk> in our lives .
I 'm going to show you some examples of what progress has done .
This is my <unk> . It 's not particularly great .
I <unk> a simple note on the <unk> to <unk> .
In my <unk> , there are <unk> <unk> , without <unk> the 10 <unk> of <unk> <unk> and the 12 <unk> that you can buy for a huge number of <unk> in <unk> <unk> that nobody of <unk> in <unk> <unk> that nobody of <unk> .
That 's what the <unk> is .
And then you go to the store <unk> for <unk> : <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , radio , <unk> , <unk> .
And in this single <unk> store , there 's a big number of <unk> <unk> .
We can make six million different <unk> using the <unk> that there are only <unk> .
<unk> <unk> that there is <unk> choice .
<unk> <unk> : the world of <unk> .
Once , when I was a child , you could get all the services <unk> , <unk> that were <unk> by <unk> <unk> .
You <unk> the phone , not <unk> it .
A <unk> of that , between the other , was that the phone never <unk> .
These days they went .
We have a <unk> <unk> <unk> , especially between phones .
Here 's the cell phones .
My <unk> is in a half , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , and <unk> for <unk> <unk> .
If you don 't have seen it in the store under the <unk> , you 're very soon <unk> .
And what happens is that people <unk> in <unk> and does this question . And you know , is the answer ? The answer is " No . "
It 's not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn 't face .
So , in other <unk> of life that are much more important than <unk> , <unk> , <unk> the same <unk> of choices .
<unk> <unk> : It doesn 't happen to the United States that you 're <unk> from <unk> and the <unk> you what you have to do .
Instead , <unk> from the <unk> , and the <unk> says , " OK , we could do it , or <unk> " <unk> " <unk> " . " And he 's got these <unk> and <unk> " <unk> <unk> these <unk> and <unk> . What do you want to do ? "
You <unk> , " <unk> , what do you want to do ? "
And the <unk> says , " <unk> has these <unk> and these <unk> , and <unk> has these <unk> and these <unk> . "
" What do you want to do ? "
And you say , " <unk> if she was me , what would you say ? "
And the <unk> : " But I 'm not her . "
We call the " <unk> <unk> " , " <unk> " <unk> " , " <unk> " <unk> " , " <unk> " <unk> " , " <unk> " . "
But actually , it 's not that a <unk> <unk> and responsibility to make decisions from someone who knows something , you know , <unk> the <unk> , to <unk> , to <unk> that they don 't know -- and it 's certainly <unk> -- and so not in <unk> to take it , and so it 's not <unk> to take the <unk> .
There 's a huge <unk> of <unk> products , <unk> to people like me and you , that if you think of it doesn 't <unk> .
But if we can 't <unk> , why do we <unk> them ?
The answer is that they want to <unk> the <unk> to <unk> the <unk> .
<unk> of the fundamental <unk> like our <unk> is a choice of choice , as you see in this <unk> . " We don 't want to <unk> kids . <unk> their sex at the right now . " We don 't <unk> a <unk> , we have to <unk> .
And we can <unk> how many times we <unk> .
which means that every <unk> , <unk> , you have to decide that kind of person , you have to decide that kind of person .
<unk> to the family and <unk> , a <unk> time , <unk> almost to anyone , and <unk> to anybody , was that , and you could get the <unk> .
The only real choice was with who , not when , and they didn 't even do after .
<unk> , all of that is really <unk> .
They were <unk> to very smart students , and they <unk> their 20 percent of the time .
And not because they 're less <unk> , because they 're not <unk> .
But why are I <unk> , I 'm going to <unk> , " <unk> <unk> or not ? <unk> it right now ? "
" <unk> <unk> <unk> later ? " I have to think before kids or my career ? "
They 're <unk> <unk> .
And they try to answer these questions , even if this <unk> , you don 't know the <unk> that <unk> and not <unk> the <unk> <unk> .
And they really have to do that . They 're important questions .
Now , the work : we <unk> , as <unk> <unk> , because technology <unk> us to work every day , every day , from every day , <unk> , <unk> that from <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , there 's a <unk> , and I 'm not going to say nobody , where the <unk> works .
I don 't say that , because I want to use it .
So , what does this incredible freedom to choice that we have about work ? It 's we need to <unk> , <unk> at every moment , if we have to work or not .
We can go to see our son to play <unk> , with the phone in a <unk> , the other , and the <unk> , <unk> .
And even if they 're all <unk> , every minute we see our son , we 're also <unk> , " I have to answer this called ? "
" I have to answer this <unk> ? I have to <unk> this letter ? "
And even when the answer is " no , " that makes the experience of your <unk> 's <unk> 's <unk> 's <unk> .
So , from any <unk> , we look at , and small objects , and <unk> of life , and life is a question of choices .
Once the world was this : <unk> , there were some possibilities , but it wasn 't a question of choice .
The world of today is , " This is , " It 's a <unk> thing , or <unk> ? "
The answer is <unk> .
<unk> <unk> them all , so I 'm going to talk about the <unk> .
<unk> this choice <unk> two effects of people .
The first , <unk> , is that it makes <unk> instead of <unk> .
With a lot of <unk> in which , it 's very hard to do it .
I 'm going to give you a <unk> <unk> : a study <unk> <unk> <unk> .
A <unk> of my <unk> <unk> <unk> , with about a million <unk> <unk> , with about a million <unk> in <unk> , with about a million <unk> in <unk> different companies .
What she discovered is that for every 10 solutions that are <unk> in the <unk> , the <unk> of <unk> two percent .
With 50 <unk> <unk> , there 's 10 percent less than <unk> than when they 're <unk> . Why are they available five . Why ?
Because with 50 <unk> in which <unk> , is hard to decide , and the choice is <unk> .
And in <unk> , and again , <unk> , <unk> , and of course , <unk> , and of course , <unk> never <unk> .
<unk> that doesn 't mean that that these <unk> <unk> food to <unk> because they don 't have enough money , it takes to say that the decision is so <unk> that we <unk> the <unk> of <unk> .
<unk> , they 're not <unk> , they 're <unk> to five <unk> <unk> for a year from the <unk> of work , which would be <unk> .
So the <unk> is a <unk> of having <unk> choices .
And I think that 's going to <unk> the world .
" And finally , to <unk> , to <unk> : <unk> or <unk> ? "
You 're going to take the right decision , if it 's for <unk> , right ?
You don 't want to choose the wrong wrong , and you <unk> the wrong wrong .
So this is the first effect . The second is that if we can <unk> the <unk> and make a choice , at the end we 're less than <unk> in which they were <unk> by the result of how to choose them .
And that 's why .
One of these is that with a lot of <unk> in which to choose , if you <unk> one and it 's not perfect , it 's easy to imagine that we could do a different choice . And what 's happening is that the <unk> <unk> <unk> us to <unk> <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> <unk> by <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> from the decision ,
And even when it was a <unk> decision .
<unk> choices there are , more easy to <unk> than any <unk> that is <unk> of <unk> .
<unk> , there is what <unk> call .
Dan <unk> has very well as as the value that we give them to things that we <unk> that we <unk> .
<unk> , when there are many <unk> , it 's easy to <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> of <unk> and <unk> of the <unk> that it 's choice .
Here 's a example . I <unk> with all the people who are not New York .
But that 's what you 're probably <unk> .
There 's this <unk> to the <unk> .
A <unk> place .
<unk> <unk> . <unk> day . It 's all for them .
<unk> nothing . But what he thinks is , " Well , <unk> , <unk> , it 's <unk> . "
" All my <unk> <unk> are away . "
" <unk> <unk> <unk> right in front of the home . "
And it <unk> two weeks from the idea that 's going to be <unk> -- every day -- the <unk> <unk> where it wants .
The <unk> <unk> for what we have , even when it was <unk> .
And the <unk> are the <unk> we have <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Here 's another example .
This <unk> tells us a lot of things .
It 's about the moment , and maybe live slowly .
But the most important point is that anything you <unk> , you 're not doing the other .
The things that don 't <unk> have a lot of <unk> that can make less <unk> what we do .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> <unk> .
I tried it on my skin <unk> a couple of <unk> .
<unk> <unk> .
Once the <unk> were just a kind of <unk> , <unk> them and <unk> , they were <unk> , just after <unk> , they were <unk> , just after <unk> a life and <unk> a lot of times , they were <unk> , just after <unk> .
So , I went to <unk> a couple of new when the <unk> were gone , and I said , " I need a couple of <unk> , this is my <unk> . "
The <unk> said , " <unk> wants to <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> ? "
You want them to <unk> or <unk> ? " <unk> " or " <unk> " ? "
" <unk> them want to <unk> ? "
" <unk> <unk> <unk> or <unk> ? <unk> <unk> <unk> -- " <unk> to <unk> .
I was <unk> , and after a little bit , I was able to say , " I want the guy that was the only guy . " He didn 't have any idea that was , so for a <unk> now , and then <unk> , <unk> , and then <unk> by the best of <unk> that I ever had .
It was the <unk> . With all that choice , I had <unk> .
But I 'm going to <unk> .
Why ? I wrote a whole book to <unk> .
The reason I was worse is that with all that choice , my <unk> were <unk> , the <unk> <unk> .
I had <unk> <unk> . I didn 't <unk> me . I was not <unk> <unk> when I was <unk> up a guy , but when we <unk> 100 different , at least one kind of had to be perfect .
What I had <unk> was good , but not perfect .
After <unk> , I went to <unk> with what I was <unk> in <unk> to <unk> .
The <unk> of <unk> in the life of people don 't make the <unk> that these have respect to the <unk> of the same <unk> .
And this <unk> <unk> , even when the results are good .
<unk> in the world 's <unk> if you have it .
Because if you <unk> it , I don 't know what I 'm talking about .
The truth is more to this .
" It was better when you was worse , " The reason why was was <unk> when you know it was worse , when you were worse , it was even even <unk> .
<unk> , in the world that we live -- <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> that we can <unk> is that things are <unk> .
You 've never never been <unk> to <unk> , because your <unk> , my <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
The <unk> of happiness -- what you 're here -- is , " <unk> <unk> " Yes , " you want it . "
I mean -- little <unk> moment -- which is really <unk> and my wife is very <unk> .
I couldn 't do better , I didn 't have <unk> .
But <unk> is not always a <unk> thing .
<unk> , a <unk> of a couple of <unk> <unk> when there is just that kind of <unk> is that when you 're not <unk> , and you say , " Why ? "
" Who is <unk> ? " <unk> is <unk> . "
The world is <unk> . What could I do ?
When there are hundreds of these kinds of <unk> , and you <unk> a <unk> , and you <unk> a <unk> , and you 'll <unk> that the <unk> you are .
We could have better .
With hundreds of <unk> available , there are no <unk> for <unk> .
So when people make decisions , even if the result is <unk> , they <unk> and they give them their own .
In the last <unk> , the <unk> is <unk> in the <unk> world .
I think a <unk> <unk> -- not the only , but important -- of this <unk> <unk> of <unk> is that people have experiences because the <unk> <unk> are too <unk> .
And when they have to <unk> this situation , they think that <unk> is .
So the final result is that in general we 're better , <unk> , but we 're worse .
Let me <unk> you .
This is the <unk> <unk> , what we all take for good and it 's completely <unk> .
There 's no <unk> that a little bit of choice , that doesn 't have to be <unk> at all , but from this doesn 't <unk> that much choice is better than a little bit .
There 's a <unk> value , <unk> . I don 't know what it is .
But I 'm sure we 've <unk> from a piece of the level where the choices <unk> our life .
Now , from the <unk> <unk> -- I 'm almost finished -- I 'm almost done -- from the <unk> <unk> .
What <unk> all of this choice in society is <unk> material .
There are a lot of places in the world , and you have <unk> <unk> , where the problem is not that they have <unk> .
The problem is they have too <unk> .
So , the <unk> that I 'm talking about is a <unk> of <unk> , <unk> society .
And what <unk> does <unk> and <unk> is this : <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> you yesterday of how those <unk> and <unk> to <unk> <unk> . It 's a <unk> of money . It 's a <unk> of money .
I mean , these choices , <unk> and <unk> , it 's not that it 's just <unk> .
They 're <unk> <unk> .
They do that worse .
If a little bit of what we in our society <unk> choice was <unk> in those where people have too few people , it wouldn 't be able to be their life , but even our own life .
This is what <unk> call a <unk> <unk> .
A <unk> of income is good to everybody -- not just the poor -- because of this choice in <unk> that will be <unk> .
And to <unk> : " <unk> , you can become everything you want to be --
<unk> , people of culture , <unk> , " What do you <unk> that fish ? "
" It 's <unk> that you can 't do anything in a glass <unk> . "
" A <unk> <unk> , a <unk> view of the world --
and <unk> I <unk> it , at the beginning .
But then , <unk> , instead , I realized that that fish knows that fish knows that fish knows .
Because the reality of <unk> is that if you <unk> the <unk> , so that you can 't be able to <unk> the freedom . It doesn 't <unk> the freedom . It 's <unk> .
If you <unk> the <unk> that you can <unk> the <unk> .
<unk> the <unk> , and <unk> the <unk> .
Everybody needs a <unk> .
This is almost certainly too <unk> , maybe for the fish , and certainly for us .
But the <unk> of some <unk> <unk> is a <unk> for <unk> and <unk> , for <unk> .
Thank you .
