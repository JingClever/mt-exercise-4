<unk> year I showed these <unk> to <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> , which for almost three million years has <unk> the <unk> of the United States <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
We 're going to <unk> the <unk> of the problem because it doesn 't show the ice <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> is , in a sense , the heart of climate system .
They <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
The next <unk> is to be a <unk> <unk> on the <unk> of the last 25 years .
<unk> <unk> are <unk> in red .
You see , you <unk> up to the blue <unk> .
That 's the ice in <unk> , which is <unk> in summer .
You can see that the <unk> ice <unk> , five years or more , is like your blood , which here is <unk> by the body .
In 25 years , it 's been <unk> for that .
This is a problem because the <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> around the ocean <unk> where there are huge <unk> of <unk> that , <unk> , are <unk> in <unk> <unk> .
<unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> , the amount of <unk> <unk> , that <unk> <unk> .
In some <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> is already <unk> by the water .
The <unk> <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> ! <unk> : She 's good . The question is if we 're <unk> .
So , a reason is that this <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
This is a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> had never <unk> <unk> <unk> .
This is the <unk> <unk> , in the <unk> of <unk> .
If you want to know how the <unk> <unk> <unk> to the sea level to the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , here is where the sea .
These <unk> are <unk> <unk> .
On the other part of the planet : <unk> , the biggest <unk> of ice on the planet .
<unk> last month , scientists have <unk> that the ice <unk> is in <unk> , and that the <unk> <unk> <unk> , which <unk> on some <unk> <unk> , is particularly <unk> in <unk> .
<unk> at six feet of the <unk> , like <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , the third greatest <unk> of ice , you see new <unk> , which a few years ago were <unk> .
<unk> percent of the world 's population <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> : This <unk> is the <unk> of <unk> water .
<unk> is <unk> .
But when you <unk> , the same happens to the <unk> water .
In California <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> is <unk> of 40 percent .
<unk> <unk> are in crisis .
<unk> , as you read , they 're <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> in the world 's <unk> to a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> are <unk> to a <unk> out of the normal and <unk> .
Sometimes , over the last 30 years of <unk> <unk> .
This is a <unk> of <unk> .
If you look at it in the <unk> context if you can see this <unk> .
In the last five years we 've <unk> 70 million <unk> of CO2 every 24 hours -- 25 million <unk> in the ocean every day .
Look at the area of the <unk> <unk> , from <unk> , to <unk> , and both of the <unk> <unk> , where there is a <unk> <unk> of oxygen in the ocean .
The <unk> <unk> of global warming , together to <unk> , which is 20 percent , is the use of <unk> <unk> .
The oil is a problem , and <unk> is even worse .
The United States is one of the two countries with <unk> emissions , together to China .
And they 're trying to build a lot of other <unk> <unk> .
But we 're <unk> to a <unk> of direction .
These are the <unk> projects over the last few years and some <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
<unk> every way , there 's a <unk> policy in our country .
<unk> <unk> and oil <unk> have <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , which is a <unk> .
<unk> image <unk> me --
<unk> <unk> , in <unk> , where I live , there was a <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
Maybe you 've seen it on the <unk> .
This is the <unk> <unk> of <unk> in America .
It 's happened around <unk> .
<unk> <unk> of one of the <unk> <unk> was this .
<unk> : <unk> ♫ ♫ <unk> the <unk> is a <unk> <unk> .
It 's <unk> here in America , and it <unk> our economy .
<unk> the <unk> is more <unk> .
It 's <unk> , <unk> and <unk> <unk> it .
<unk> : From here , a lot of <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The greatest greatest <unk> society on the <unk> is <unk> <unk> . This is his <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> <unk> -- Al <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> -- they don 't know what they 're talking about .
<unk> : So the <unk> for the <unk> of <unk> has <unk> two <unk> .
This is one of them , one part .
<unk> : <unk> : <unk> <unk> , we see the climate change as a <unk> <unk> to our business .
So our <unk> is a great amount of money in a <unk> <unk> to <unk> to <unk> public and <unk> the truth on <unk> .
In fact , <unk> is not <unk> .
We think it 's <unk> -- it also has a good <unk> .
So we don 't <unk> of climate change .
We could do it .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> : <unk> <unk> -- you 've heard a lot of them .
So , we <unk> a turn into a <unk> structure for <unk> .
<unk> ! <unk> cars are a little <unk> , but this is the sound of <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> is between the major <unk> of global warming , but the <unk> <unk> technology that you see changes everything .
So , let 's look , this is the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> to the economic issue and the national security .
<unk> : <unk> is the <unk> : America is <unk> ; the national security crisis .
The <unk> that <unk> all : our <unk> <unk> <unk> , like <unk> <unk> and oil <unk> .
Now , there 's a new <unk> , <unk> solution to <unk> .
<unk> America : 100 percent of <unk> energy , in 10 years .
A <unk> for <unk> America to work , more <unk> , and help <unk> the global <unk> .
<unk> , a solution that we 're <unk> to solve our problems .
<unk> America . <unk> more . <unk> .
<unk> : This is the last one .
<unk> : <unk> : It 's <unk> energy to America .
One of the most <unk> ways of <unk> to <unk> from the <unk> that <unk> our planet .
<unk> : The future is here . <unk> , <unk> , a new network .
<unk> <unk> 2 : <unk> <unk> for jobs .
<unk> : <unk> America . It 's time to be <unk> .
<unk> : A old <unk> <unk> says , " If you want to go to alone .
If you want to go far , you go to the <unk> . "
We have to go far , quickly .
Thank you very much .
<unk> year at TED I did a <unk> on <unk> .
And we try to <unk> them on how the machine works .
So here we go . And for the ones that the other time there was no , the <unk> is the greatest <unk> <unk> that ever <unk> -- <unk> miles of <unk> .
His <unk> is to <unk> the conditions that were in less than a <unk> of the <unk> of the universe to the way to <unk> million times a second .
That 's just <unk> .
This is the machine under <unk> .
We <unk> these <unk> <unk> into the <unk> .
This is what I work . It 's called <unk> -- <unk> feet <unk> and has a <unk> <unk> .
This is a <unk> picture of <unk> in building so you can see the <unk> .
<unk> 10 <unk> of the last year we <unk> the machine for the first time .
And this picture was <unk> by <unk> .
It was <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> .
It 's a picture of the first <unk> of the particles that had made all of the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , with a part of the <unk> , and <unk> particles into the <unk> .
In other words , when you <unk> the picture of the 10 <unk> , you 'll see that the machine , the <unk> is a great <unk> .
I don 't know if it was this to <unk> <unk> more or this , when somebody <unk> on Google and <unk> that the page was this .
That means we 've had a <unk> impact beyond the scientific <unk> .
<unk> a week later , there was a problem with the machine , we had to just these <unk> <unk> here -- these <unk> <unk> .
These <unk> <unk> <unk> when the machine works at the <unk> of the <unk> .
Now , the <unk> between you <unk> the <unk> and <unk> , " It 's not true . They 're too <unk> . "
And they can do it because when they 're very <unk> <unk> .
So , at least <unk> degrees , to a temperature <unk> to the space between stars , these <unk> can bring that <unk> that <unk> .
In one of the <unk> between the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , there was a <unk> of <unk> .
So the <unk> <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a electric <unk> .
That was the result .
Now , this is even more <unk> if you think that these <unk> <unk> more <unk> 20 <unk> , and that 's <unk> of about 30 <unk> .
They <unk> about 50 <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , what we did .
We <unk> them and <unk> .
Now they 're all <unk> to their <unk> .
<unk> the end of <unk> the <unk> is going to be again .
We <unk> it , and we try to get <unk> data to <unk> or <unk> , and we continue to <unk> what the <unk> are <unk> that <unk> the universe .
Now , of course , in a way , these <unk> <unk> the <unk> value of science and engineering engineering engineering <unk> . It 's easy to <unk> .
I think that it 's so hard , the fact that it 's so hard , the fact that it 's value of things like <unk> .
I want to <unk> with the words of a <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , which <unk> , <unk> , <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of his <unk> , his <unk> was <unk> , he said , " It 's not as <unk> as the <unk> that the ideas of human mind as <unk> that the ideas of science are <unk> , that our <unk> are <unk> , and that our <unk> are <unk> , and there are not new <unk> .
Thank you .
I want to start <unk> to <unk> to when when , from children , <unk> with <unk> .
<unk> how we <unk> and <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> ,
The <unk> <unk> is <unk> <unk> to the way that most part of the world around us .
So , by <unk> <unk> from the <unk> of our <unk> with <unk> objects , and my <unk> <unk> <unk> , and my <unk> <unk> <unk> , I started <unk> , I started <unk> , " And if we use a computer , instead of having the only <unk> of the <unk> as digital <unk> that <unk> <unk> as a <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> with both of the <unk> ,
and <unk> to our <unk> ?
The <unk> was so interesting that we wanted to explore the answer , building <unk> .
In a few words , a <unk> is a <unk> computer as a <unk> .
In a few words , a <unk> is a <unk> computer as a <unk> .
You can <unk> with your hand , they can <unk> them to be <unk> with their own , feel the movement and they have a screen and a <unk> radio .
But <unk> , they 're <unk> , like <unk> , you can just <unk> <unk> .
<unk> is the <unk> of a new <unk> of tools to <unk> digital information .
And as they become more <unk> , <unk> of the <unk> of the movement , of others , and as they become more <unk> , <unk> of their movement , other , how we can <unk> them , new <unk> <unk> .
Let 's start with some simple example .
This <unk> is <unk> to show : if you <unk> it in a direction , the video will be so , if we go from the other side , you 'll see it so , if we go to the other side back .
These <unk> <unk> are <unk> of others .
If you <unk> them , you 're <unk> what they are around .
If they 're <unk> , they can <unk> it and they can <unk> a little bit .
If they 're <unk> , they can <unk> it and they can <unk> a little bit .
They also <unk> their movement and <unk> .
We 're <unk> that one of the interesting <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> was the <unk> to be able to use common on data , for example , <unk> <unk> as if it was a <unk> .
In this case , we have three <unk> <unk> as a <unk> <unk> of <unk> and I can <unk> to <unk> the <unk> of color in the central <unk> , where they 're <unk> .
and I can <unk> to <unk> the color in the central one , where they 're <unk> .
If we <unk> too much , we can <unk> a little bit to the place .
There are also <unk> to <unk> , like <unk> , math and games where people can <unk> things things things , and they can <unk> things things , and <unk> the results immediately immediately .
I 'm --
This is a <unk> <unk> that I do with a <unk> <unk> program .
Here we have a words that 's <unk> between <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> , at every <unk> <unk> a letter to <unk> on every <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , to every <unk> , and as we <unk> to <unk> a letter to <unk> on every <unk> , and while I 'm <unk> with <unk> words .
Then , after about 30 seconds , you get it back , and you have a new <unk> of <unk> and new possibilities to try .
Thank you .
Here are <unk> children in <unk> to the <unk> <unk> , I did that I <unk> them and I <unk> a video .
They 're very <unk> .
And one of the interesting things of this <unk> <unk> is that you don 't have to give people a lot of <unk> .
I just mean , " <unk> of words , " and they know what to do .
Here 's other people who <unk> it .
This is our <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , there .
It just wanted to <unk> .
They were just <unk> , for him .
Now , this is a <unk> of a <unk> <unk> .
We wanted to build a tool for the <unk> of <unk> . He 's <unk> .
It can <unk> new characters in the scene , <unk> their <unk> .
It can <unk> new characters in the scene , <unk> their <unk> .
Here 's , it 's <unk> the sun .
<unk> : The sun is <unk> .
David <unk> : Now he 's taken a <unk> in the scene .
<unk> : The <unk> <unk> .
<unk> work ! Yeah !
So <unk> the <unk> and <unk> <unk> can <unk> the characters --
<unk> : <unk> !
<unk> their own story .
<unk> : <unk> !
<unk> : It 's a <unk> story , and it can decide how it <unk> .
<unk> : It 's a <unk> story , and it can decide how it <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> away , <unk> .
<unk> : The last example I have the time I 'm going to show you is a <unk> , <unk> recently , to <unk> and <unk> music .
It 's a <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , to <unk> music .
The <unk> here are <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
<unk> of these has four different <unk> , and you can choose which you use .
You can also <unk> these <unk> into a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And they just <unk> a " sound " and a <unk> sequence . "
These are effects that you can control from alive , like <unk> and <unk> .
I 'll <unk> it to a particular sound and then <unk> to <unk> .
And then there are the effects of <unk> and <unk> , which <unk> to the entire sequence .
It 's how it works .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> a <unk> in two <unk> <unk> , " <unk> " <unk> " <unk> " <unk> " <unk> " . "
Now you 're going to take a bottom .
<unk> : <unk> : Now , I 'm going to <unk> <unk>
<unk> : And now I 'm going to <unk> the <unk> to the <unk> <unk> , so I can control the effect of the alive .
<unk> : I can <unk> the entire sequence <unk> time from one side or another .
<unk> : And now we 're <unk> the <unk> <unk> to give the <unk> to <unk> more <unk> .
<unk> : I can <unk> the <unk> <unk> . I can <unk> the <unk> <unk> .
So I don 't have to <unk> before , but I can <unk> it , <unk> more <unk> or more <unk> .
And now , finally , I can <unk> the entire <unk> <unk> on the left the <unk> " <unk> . "
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is to build new <unk> <unk> <unk> to how our brain work and body .
And today , I 've had time to show you one of the results of this path , and also some possibilities we 're trying to bring out out of the lab .
The idea I want to <unk> is that it 's <unk> this new generation of <unk> objects to <unk> the <unk> media , which <unk> information in our world in the way we want .
Thank you very much .
I don 't see the time to speak to all of you .
They 're a <unk> .
<unk> books is my <unk> , but it 's more than that , of course .
It 's also love and the <unk> of my life .
And I don 't expect that it can change .
But , he said this , something that was <unk> in my life and my career , which <unk> me to <unk> the whole relationship with this work .
The particular thing is I <unk> wrote this book , this <unk> called " <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
And the result is that everywhere I think , people <unk> me as if I was <unk> .
<unk> -- <unk> , <unk> !
I 'm going to <unk> everybody and they say , " You don 't fear of you not be able to do better ?
You don 't fear to write for the whole life without able to be able to create a book that can <unk> to someone ? "
Is it going to be ? "
It 's <unk> , you know .
But it could go worse , to the <unk> part of me , when I was saying to people -- I was a <unk> -- I wanted to be a <unk> .
I 'm going to <unk> the same <unk> <unk> .
And people would say , " Don 't you be able to do not be able to be successful ?
You don 't fear that the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> ?
You don 't fear to do this <unk> for all life without any of it is ever out and die on a <unk> of dreams with the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> ? "
So , you know .
The answer -- the short answer to all these questions is , " Yes . "
Yes , I 'm fear of all those things .
I 've always had fear .
And I also fear of many other things that people don 't have to be <unk> .
Like <unk> and other things .
But , as it is about writing what I thought and I would say , " Why is it ?
Is it <unk> ?
It 's <unk> that anybody who <unk> <unk> to be <unk> by a job that you feel born for me .
But what is there is so particular in <unk> <unk> <unk> to <unk> health <unk> in a way that other <unk> don 't do ?
How do my father , for example , he was a <unk> <unk> and not remember one time in his <unk> <unk> ' <unk> ' <unk> ' <unk> ' <unk> ' <unk> ' <unk> ?
It was never -- that <unk> of John <unk> , how do you go ?
<unk> 't you like that , <unk> ?
<unk> , the <unk> engineers like <unk> <unk> . They certainly <unk> the <unk> of being <unk> <unk> <unk> .
We <unk> , we have enough this <unk> , and not only <unk> but <unk> of all that , we have this <unk> to be <unk> <unk> .
And we don 't want to look at the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> that , only in the <unk> century , <unk> young and often to do with them .
And the ones that don 't have <unk> to be really <unk> by their <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , before you die , in the last <unk> said , " I 'm going to be a little more , " <unk> me a little more <unk> about work on their life .
But we don 't <unk> <unk> when we could say , because we 've heard these things so long that somehow we 've <unk> and <unk> the <unk> that creativity and <unk> is a <unk> that creativity and <unk> is in a way , and that art , at the end , we always <unk> to the <unk> .
And the question I want to <unk> to everybody here is : are <unk> <unk> with this idea ?
It 's good for this -- because it 's also <unk> by a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
I think it 's <unk> .
And I think it 's also <unk> and I don 't want to <unk> <unk> in the next century .
I think it 's better <unk> our great <unk> to live .
And I certainly know , in my case -- it would be very <unk> to start <unk> to the <unk> <unk> of <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> the <unk> in which I 'm in my career .
<unk> -- <unk> , look , they 're quite young , I have about 40 years .
I 've still about four <unk> of work in me .
And it 's very <unk> that anything <unk> of now in the world as the work that we 're <unk> after the <unk> <unk> of my last book .
<unk> <unk> , because we 're all <unk> or less friends here -- is <unk> that my greatest success is to my <unk> .
Oh , <unk> , <unk> , who thought !
You know this is the kind of <unk> that leads a person to start <unk> to the nine of the morning , and I don 't want to do it .
I could continue to do this work that I love .
So the question becomes , how do you ?
And so I think , after many <unk> , that the way of working on is what to create a <unk> <unk> <unk> , OK ?
I have to have to find a <unk> distance between me , which I 'm <unk> , and my natural <unk> on what we could do . And as we <unk> for the <unk> of the last year models of how to do we look through time , trying to find other society to see if we have better ideas and find some <unk> ideas and <unk> .
about how to help people <unk> to <unk> <unk> of creativity .
And that research has taken me to the <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> because they <unk> in <unk> and then <unk> back .
<unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> -- people don 't believe that creativity <unk> from men , OK ?
It <unk> that creativity was this <unk> spirit and <unk> to <unk> to men from a <unk> <unk> and <unk> , for <unk> and <unk> , for <unk> and <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> these <unk> <unk> of creativity . "
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> to have a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> were the same idea , but they <unk> that species of the spirit without a <unk> .
That 's <unk> , because the <unk> didn 't really think a <unk> was somebody who was particularly smart .
And I thought that a <unk> was this kind of <unk> <unk> that <unk> literally <unk> in the <unk> of an artist , a little bit like <unk> <unk> , and that <unk> out of <unk> the work of the artist and <unk> the <unk> of that work .
<unk> <unk> <unk> , that 's the distance I 'm talking -- that <unk> <unk> that <unk> you from your <unk> <unk> .
And everybody thought it was so that it was , right ?
So the <unk> artists were <unk> by <unk> things , like <unk> , for example , too <unk> , right ?
If your work was <unk> not to <unk> the <unk> , everybody <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
If your work <unk> , it wasn 't all your <unk> , right ?
Everybody <unk> that was your <unk> to be a <unk> .
And so people are <unk> to be <unk> for a long time .
Then the <unk> <unk> and everything <unk> , and we <unk> this great idea ; we put the human human to the center of the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk>
This was the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> and people started to think that creativity is <unk> completely from <unk> .
And for the first time in history , they <unk> to <unk> to this or that artist as a <unk> <unk> rather than to a person with <unk> .
And I have to <unk> , I think that was a big <unk> .
I think you 're going to <unk> to be like a <unk> person to believe that I be like a <unk> like the source , <unk> and <unk> of all the <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> is a <unk> <unk> to <unk> .
It 's like to ask someone to <unk> the sun .
<unk> and <unk> completely the <unk> and creates all these <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And I think that was this pressure to have <unk> artists in <unk> 500 years .
And if this is true , and I think that 's that , the question becomes , and the question now is , and that 's it becomes , and now ?
Can we do it ?
We want to go back to a more <unk> understanding of the relationship between human and <unk> <unk> .
or maybe no .
Maybe we can 't <unk> 500 years of thinking in a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And there 's probably people in the audience who <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> on the <unk> , <unk> , do you do <unk> people <unk> <unk> to <unk> on their projects .
You probably don 't <unk> all of this .
But the question I want to <unk> is -- why don 't you ?
Why don 't we do that ?
Because it makes sense of anything that I 've ever heard to explain the <unk> of the <unk> process .
A process that , as anyone who ever <unk> to do something -- so , basically , everybody knows , you know , you don 't <unk> <unk> .
And in fact , it can sometimes be completely <unk> .
I did this <unk> <unk> with the extraordinary <unk> <unk> <unk> , who has now 90 years , but it was a <unk> <unk> for all of life and said that during his <unk> in <unk> <unk> , <unk> out in the <unk> <unk> , <unk> out in the <unk> <unk> , <unk> out in the <unk> <unk> .
He said she was like a <unk> <unk> air .
And that we <unk> <unk> to her from <unk> .
I <unk> it to come , because he was <unk> the earth under his feet .
I decided to have one thing to do to that point and he was , he said , " <unk> as a <unk> . "
And so he <unk> to the house and he was <unk> by this <unk> , and it wouldn 't have to do anything else that you could take a piece of paper and a <unk> enough <unk> , <unk> and <unk> on the page .
Sometimes it doesn 't have to be fast enough , so <unk> and <unk> and <unk> without able to be able to get home and <unk> it through and she would <unk> it through and she would <unk> through the <unk> , looking for , as she said , " another <unk> . "
Then there were the <unk> -- this is never <unk> -- there were some times -- there were times when the was almost <unk> , OK ?
So , he was <unk> home and he was looking for for paper and the <unk> <unk> through , and he <unk> a <unk> right in the while he was <unk> , and then he said , he was like if he <unk> with the other hand and <unk> .
It <unk> the tail <unk> and <unk> into his body and <unk> it on the page .
And in these cases , the <unk> would be <unk> on the <unk> page , but the <unk> , the <unk> word to the first one .
So when the <unk> <unk> -- it 's <unk> , it 's exactly <unk> to my <unk> process .
Not my <unk> process -- I 'm not a <unk> !
I 'm a <unk> , and my way to <unk> is ; <unk> at the same <unk> every day and work and work and <unk> on top .
But even me in my <unk> , I <unk> against that thing , sometimes .
And we 'll find that many of you <unk> that .
You know , even if the work and ideas , I would <unk> to be <unk> by a source , I could not <unk> <unk> .
And what this is this thing ?
And how can we <unk> it in a way we can 't <unk> your head , but rather , what 's it going to do with it ?
As I 'm <unk> , the best example I have is the <unk> <unk> <unk> , which I 've <unk> <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> for a <unk> .
I was talking about this , and you know , <unk> , for the <unk> of life was the <unk> of the <unk> artist <unk> <unk> , trying to control , <unk> these <unk> species of <unk> <unk> <unk> .
But then <unk> , he was <unk> , and a day while he was <unk> on a <unk> <unk> , <unk> it all for him .
It 's going fast fast and all of a <unk> <unk> this little <unk> of <unk> , which is in his head as the <unk> <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , and you know , it 's wonderful , and <unk> , but he doesn 't know how to <unk> it .
It doesn 't have a piece of paper , it doesn 't have a <unk> .
So it starts to hear this sort of old <unk> <unk> to grow in him , like , " I 'm going to lose , and <unk> <unk> from this song <unk> .
I 'm not enough , <unk> , and I can 't <unk> . "
And instead of going to the <unk> , they <unk> .
<unk> the whole <unk> process and did something completely new .
It just just <unk> the sky and said , " <unk> , you don 't see I 'm <unk> ? "
" It seems to you can write a song now ?
If you really want to <unk> , you 're <unk> in a more <unk> when I can <unk> care of you .
<unk> , <unk> to <unk> another <unk> .
<unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> . "
And his <unk> <unk> process after this .
Not the work , the work was still <unk> as always .
But the process , and the <unk> <unk> that was <unk> when he <unk> the <unk> , the <unk> that <unk> out of him , the <unk> that outside he was <unk> <unk> .
but we <unk> this <unk> , wonderful <unk> <unk> a conversation between <unk> and this <unk> thing that <unk> and <unk> <unk> that was not <unk> .
So how <unk> that story is to change a little bit , the way I 'm going to <unk> a time .
This idea , I <unk> when I was <unk> , " <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , " and I <unk> in one of the <unk> of the <unk> that we all work on something , and we don 't think it 's going to be a <unk> , that what the <unk> will ever do .
Not just <unk> , the <unk> book .
And we started to think of <unk> this project .
But then I 'm going to <unk> that <unk> to the air and <unk> .
So I <unk> my face on the <unk> and <unk> my <unk> to a corner of the room .
And I said to <unk> <unk> , " <unk> , what , both we know if this book is not going to be <unk> , don 't it ?
Because as you see I 'm <unk> everything I have , I don 't have more than that .
So if you want it to be better , you have to <unk> and do your part .
OK . But if you don 't do it , you know what , I don 't do it , I 'm going to do anything .
I started to write the same because it 's my work .
And I would like you to think that it was <unk> that I 've <unk> to do my part . " Because it 's like this , OK -- it 's in the <unk> of the <unk> of the moon , <unk> music that <unk> , and <unk> that we 'll <unk> the <unk> of the moon , <unk> music that we <unk> forward for hours to the <unk> .
And they were always <unk> , because the <unk> were <unk> and they were <unk> .
But every long , I think , something <unk> , and one of these <unk> artists actually <unk> .
And I know you know what I 'm talking about , because I know you 've all seen it , at a <unk> , a <unk> like this .
It was like if time <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> through a kind of <unk> and he wasn 't doing anything different from , like <unk> <unk> before , but everything was <unk> .
And suddenly it doesn 't just like a human .
But they <unk> from <unk> and <unk> in the <unk> of <unk> .
And when this <unk> , at the time , people <unk> what was , they <unk> with his name .
<unk> your hands and <unk> to <unk> , " <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , God , God . "
That 's God , you know .
<unk> <unk> <unk> -- when the <unk> <unk> the <unk> of <unk> , they <unk> this <unk> with them and the <unk> <unk> in <unk> by " <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , " <unk> , " <unk> , " that you can hear in <unk> or in <unk> .
In <unk> , when an artist did something impossible and <unk> , " <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> -- a <unk> of God .
And it 's <unk> because we need it .
But , the problem comes the next day , for the same , when you <unk> and <unk> <unk> that are 11 <unk> of <unk> <unk> and <unk> of God is no more .
It 's just a <unk> with a lot of <unk> <unk> , and maybe you will never <unk> to <unk> that <unk> .
And maybe no one <unk> the name of God who 's <unk> , and what 's going to do with the rest of his life ?
It 's hard .
This is one of the most <unk> <unk> to do in a <unk> life .
But maybe it 's not to be so <unk> if you can 't believe , you will not believe , <unk> , <unk> that the <unk> <unk> of your being being from yourself .
But let me just show you that you 're <unk> data in <unk> from a <unk> <unk> of this <unk> part of your life that you have to go to <unk> when you 're finished .
And , you know , if we think it all changes .
And so I started <unk> , and it 's certainly how I <unk> it for several months during the <unk> of the book that I would soon be , the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> ,
And what I have to continue to <unk> when I feel I feel <unk> from that is , not fear .
It doesn 't <unk> . It 's just your work .
<unk> to <unk> for your part , any of it can be .
If your work is <unk> , <unk> .
If the <unk> , you 'll <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> some kind of <unk> , for just a moment through your <unk> , then you go through the <unk> , " <unk> ! "
<unk> , you do the same your <unk> .
And " <unk> ! " <unk> ! " You 're the same .
I think and I think it 's <unk> .
" <unk> ! " <unk> ! " <unk> , " only for having had to be <unk> <unk> <unk> . "
Thank you .
Thank you .
<unk> <unk> : <unk> !
As you know , I 've already talked about some of these projects on the human genome , what it can <unk> and <unk> the discovery of new genes .
We 're now <unk> a new path : we started <unk> biology and now starting to <unk> biology and we 're <unk> in a new <unk> of biology , <unk> and <unk> life .
We 've always tried to <unk> big questions .
" <unk> is life ? " It 's something that many <unk> , I think they have <unk> to understand at different levels .
We tried different <unk> , <unk> to the <unk> terms .
We 're <unk> for about 20 years .
When we <unk> the human genome <unk> to <unk> to go from the world of biology to digital biology to the world .
Now we can <unk> the life , or create new life from this digital <unk> ?
This is the map of a little <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , which is the species from the <unk> genome between those that can <unk> in the lab .
And we tried to <unk> the genome to <unk> a little more <unk> .
We 're able to <unk> a <unk> of genes about 500 that are here .
But when we take a look at his <unk> map , it 's <unk> simple than our .
<unk> , this is simple .
But when we look at all the genes we can <unk> , one at the time , is very <unk> that this can bring to a <unk> cell .
So we thought the only way to <unk> was <unk> this <unk> <unk> to <unk> some of these <unk> questions .
So we started the <unk> of " We can <unk> a <unk> ? "
Can the chemistry <unk> to produce these big molecules that we 've never been able to create before ?
And , in case , can we make a <unk> ?
A <unk> is just a piece of <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The speed we 're able to <unk> life is <unk> to <unk> <unk> .
Our <unk> capacity to write the code , instead of <unk> , but it 's <unk> .
And our <unk> <unk> the <unk> results on a <unk> <unk> .
We 've <unk> over 15 years ago .
The process has <unk> a lot of <unk> , <unk> with a <unk> <unk> before <unk> the first experiments .
But we found that DNA <unk> is very difficult .
There are <unk> of thousands of cars in the world that <unk> little <unk> of DNA , of 30 to 50 <unk> and it 's a <unk> process . The <unk> is <unk> , the <unk> is along , more <unk> .
So we had to develop a new way to <unk> these <unk> and <unk> the <unk> .
And that was our first <unk> <unk> , starting from digital information of <unk> <unk> <unk> .
It 's a little virus that bacteria <unk> .
We designed the <unk> , <unk> the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> a DNA <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
The interesting part is when we took this piece of <unk> <unk> <unk> and we <unk> it in bacteria , the bacteria have <unk> to read this code , and <unk> the <unk> particles .
The <unk> particles are <unk> by cells , they <unk> back and <unk> the <unk> <unk> .
I 've talked about recently with members of the <unk> <unk> <unk> that they have <unk> this model .
They have more than you .
<unk> that this is a situation where software can actually build his own <unk> in a <unk> system .
But we could do things more in the big .
We wanted to build the entire <unk> of <unk> .
They 're more than <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
So we thought we 're going to <unk> in the size of the virus , so that we can change the <unk> to understand what the <unk> of a <unk> cell .
The <unk> is <unk> , and if we <unk> <unk> <unk> into a computer , these must be very <unk> .
When we <unk> this genome for the first time in <unk> the standard <unk> was of a <unk> for every 10 <unk> <unk> .
We found , <unk> , 30 <unk> . If we were <unk> the <unk> <unk> , we 'll never be able to do it work .
A <unk> of the process is to design <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> with all the other <unk> of 50 <unk> to build <unk> <unk> <unk> to build smaller <unk> that <unk> together .
It 's <unk> elements here .
You probably read that there are <unk> <unk> .
So , we have a <unk> code on four <unk> : A , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
<unk> of those <unk> <unk> together <unk> <unk> <unk> , and there 's a <unk> order to <unk> every <unk> .
So we can use the code to write words , <unk> , <unk> .
What we did at the beginning was <unk> .
Some of them were <unk> by the fact that it wasn 't <unk> .
We designed these <unk> to <unk> by just <unk> with <unk> .
There are <unk> that <unk> them and <unk> <unk> .
And we started <unk> with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> every step we made these <unk> in <unk> so that we 're <unk> to <unk> <unk> , because we 're trying to create a <unk> <unk> <unk> as you 'll see in a minute .
We 're trying to <unk> the process .
So this seems to the <unk> of a <unk> <unk> .
When we go to these <unk> <unk> <unk> , more than 100 <unk> <unk> , you don 't get to directly <unk> in the <unk> <unk> .
It 's <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
So we have <unk> other <unk> .
<unk> of another <unk> called <unk> <unk> , which in biology <unk> to <unk> the DNA that can <unk> the <unk> .
Here 's an example .
This <unk> , called <unk> <unk> , can <unk> three million <unk> <unk> .
You can see in the <unk> <unk> as his <unk> is <unk> .
In 12 hours , it 's <unk> exactly as it was before .
<unk> thousands of organisms that are able to do that .
These organisms can be completely <unk> .
We 'll be <unk> under <unk> .
It 's absolutely sure that life <unk> into space , and they <unk> to find new <unk> of water .
It 's true , NASA 's shown that this happens .
This is a picture of the <unk> that we built using these <unk> , just using these <unk> , just using these <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> <unk> them .
This picture was not <unk> with a <unk> <unk> , but with a <unk> <unk> .
It 's a <unk> so big that we can <unk> with a <unk> <unk> .
These are pictures that <unk> a period of about six seconds .
That 's the <unk> we 've done a little time ago .
They 're more than <unk> <unk> <unk> .
It 's the biggest <unk> of a <unk> structure ever <unk> by man .
It 's got a <unk> weight to 300 million .
If you <unk> it with a <unk> 10 without spaces , we 'll be <unk> pages to <unk> this code .
Now , how do we do it ? How do we do it ?
Of course , with a virus is a <unk> <unk> .
It 's a little more <unk> when you 're using bacteria .
It 's even even when it comes to <unk> cells as our , you can just <unk> the <unk> and <unk> another , which is basically the process of <unk> .
In <unk> , the <unk> <unk> is <unk> into the cell , but we <unk> <unk> that we 're able to do a <unk> <unk> of a cell <unk> to another cell <unk> to another and <unk> .
We <unk> a <unk> <unk> from a kind of <unk> .
The two are different than men from <unk> .
We 've <unk> some <unk> in more <unk> way we could decide which to choose which <unk> to choose what this <unk> .
And then he <unk> with the <unk> so that we <unk> all the <unk> .
And when we put it in the cell was <unk> and <unk> our <unk> <unk> the new <unk> <unk> , went into the cell .
And <unk> <unk> that we don 't want to go beyond , but we still tried to <unk> it more in there .
This is one of the major <unk> of evolution .
We found that <unk> species have <unk> a second or a third <unk> somewhere , <unk> in a second thousands of new <unk> to that species .
So who thinks about evolution as a <unk> only <unk> to the time you <unk> has not <unk> a lot of of biology .
<unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> that was in the cell didn 't <unk> one .
The <unk> <unk> we <unk> .
It 's <unk> , and he <unk> the other <unk> as <unk> material , and he <unk> us with only the cell and the new <unk> .
It 's blue because of the genes we <unk> .
And in a short <unk> of time , all the <unk> of a species are <unk> , and they <unk> all over a new species , <unk> on the new software , and we <unk> around the new software that we <unk> in the cell .
All the <unk> are <unk> , and the <unk> are <unk> , and when you <unk> the code <unk> is exactly to what we 've <unk> you .
Now , this could look <unk> , but we <unk> the software DNA , but we can <unk> the software to change things in a pretty <unk> .
Now , I 've already <unk> that there doesn 't talk about <unk> -- but of progress , <unk> <unk> , and I said that maybe we 're going to create a new version of <unk> , and I already said that maybe we 're going to create a new <unk> of <unk> , and we 're going to be <unk> new species <unk> on this process .
Why do that ?
I think it 's pretty <unk> when we think about our <unk> .
We 're going to go from six and a half billion people in <unk> billion in the next 40 years .
Just to give an example : I was born in <unk> .
Now there are three people on the planet to <unk> in <unk> ; in 40 years , there will be four .
We 're <unk> problems now to find food , water <unk> and <unk> , <unk> and <unk> for six billion people .
We 're even more <unk> to do that for nine billion .
<unk> more than five billion <unk> , more than 30 billion <unk> .
That means 100 million <unk> a day .
When we try to find <unk> <unk> , or any kind of <unk> process to <unk> , it will be a huge challenge .
In more we have to realize that all of CO2 <unk> from these materials that <unk> into the atmosphere .
At the day , because of the <unk> <unk> around the world , we have a <unk> with about 20 million genes , and I like to think that are <unk> <unk> for the future .
The <unk> industry is only a <unk> of <unk> , and think about how many different things are <unk> out .
Our <unk> here is <unk> data from reality and our imagination .
We now have <unk> , <unk> to these <unk> <unk> <unk> , able to create what we call <unk> <unk> .
We 're able to build a big robot that can produce a million <unk> a day .
<unk> of <unk> these 20 million genes or <unk> to try to <unk> the <unk> to produce <unk> or <unk> , new <unk> , we can change , with a little team , and create more biology <unk> now that in the last 20 years of science .
And it 's just a standard <unk> .
We can choose to <unk> , <unk> , chemistry or <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
This is a <unk> of some software <unk> that we 're working on being able to be able to <unk> and design species to the computer .
We don 't know <unk> how they will be .
We know exactly how their code is .
We 're now <unk> on the <unk> of <unk> .
You also saw that you would have <unk> from <unk> was an experiment .
We <unk> second and third generation that we <unk> enough to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> more <unk> than <unk> value as <unk> or different kinds of <unk> .
But the only way that biology can have a big impact without <unk> <unk> the cost of food and <unk> the <unk> would be <unk> the CO2 as we 're working on the first , we 're working on the cells that can reach this goal , and we think we can have the first <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> in about 18 months .
<unk> <unk> with CO2 is a <unk> , but in our <unk> <unk> around the world , we 've found different <unk> .
This is a <unk> we <unk> in <unk> .
It <unk> into the deep ocean , at about <unk> feet <unk> to the temperature of water <unk> .
We 're <unk> from CO2 using hydrogen <unk> as hydrogen <unk> as hydrogen <unk> .
We 're trying to figure out if we can <unk> CO2 , which can easily be <unk> by <unk> , <unk> that CO2 in <unk> , to drive this process .
So , we think we could be able to <unk> what the basic question of " what is life is . We , we have the <unk> goal to <unk> the whole <unk> of the whole <unk> industry .
<unk> . If you can 't do that from TED , where can you do it ?
It 's a main source of energy .
And we 're working for the same <unk> to create <unk> .
You 've seen this year with flu , we always go back to a year and with a dollar in less when it comes to find the right <unk> .
I think what you can <unk> to <unk> <unk> .
Here 's how the future could start look <unk> , now , the tree of evolution , <unk> evolution with <unk> bacteria , <unk> , and finally cells .
We 're so so much to <unk> people .
Our goal is to make a long enough to <unk> to try to <unk> it . Thank you very much .
First of all I 'll do , the <unk> of the <unk> possible , some <unk> work , new technology that we 've taken to <unk> a <unk> <unk> a year ago . This is <unk> .
It 's a environment where you can <unk> is at the local level that <unk> with a huge amount of <unk> data .
Here we 're seeing <unk> <unk> of <unk> with a kind of <unk> <unk> with a kind of <unk> <unk> , <unk> the images as we want .
And it doesn 't matter how big the amount of information that we see , how big these <unk> are <unk> of data or <unk> .
Most of them are common photographs , but this is a <unk> <unk> from the <unk> of <unk> , and <unk> in the <unk> of 300 <unk> .
It doesn 't make any difference because the only thing you <unk> the <unk> of a system like this is the number of <unk> on your screen at any time . It 's also a lot of architecture .
This is a whole book , example of data not <unk> .
This is the <unk> <unk> <unk> . Every <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And to <unk> that this is just about <unk> and not <unk> of images , we can do something like that , to see it 's a real <unk> of the text , not to a picture .
It could be a way to read a little <unk> book .
I don 't <unk> it .
This is a more <unk> example . It 's a number of <unk> .
Every image of a big picture is the beginning of a <unk> .
And it really gives you the pleasure and the beautiful experience of read the real version of a <unk> or a <unk> , which is for nature a <unk> of a <unk> .
We also did something with the corner of this , in particular <unk> of The <unk> .
We created a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> much more than what you use in a normal <unk> , and we <unk> <unk> <unk> .
If you want to see the <unk> of this <unk> , you can see here .
or other models , even the <unk> <unk> .
And this really <unk> some of these ideas to <unk> the <unk> of space on the screen .
We think this <unk> to put it to the <unk> and other <unk> <unk> , not to be <unk> .
Of course , the <unk> is one of the most <unk> <unk> for this kind of technology .
And on this , I don 't want to lose time , if we don 't say we have <unk> <unk> to give you to <unk> to <unk> in this field .
These are all the <unk> in the U.S. <unk> <unk> above a NASA <unk> picture .
So we 're going to go to something else .
This is now in the web of the web ; you can see it .
It 's a project called <unk> , which <unk> two different technologies .
One is <unk> and the other is a <unk> <unk> <unk> , a <unk> student of Washington , a <unk> student of Washington , with the help of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And it 's alive on the web , <unk> by <unk> .
You can <unk> when we do this kind of <unk> , where we can <unk> from a picture to the other and have this kind of experience in <unk> <unk> .
But the <unk> <unk> of images here has actually a meaning .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> on the <unk> <unk> <unk> on the <unk> <unk> <unk> on the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> on the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . <unk> are <unk> . It 's a <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> , and these things are all <unk> <unk> .
I don 't know if I have time to show you some other environment .
There are some more <unk> .
I want to go directly directly to one of the <unk> of <unk> <unk> and this <unk> <unk> <unk> that we 've done for the first time we 'll go to the summer to show you what we 're really <unk> is the key behind this technology , the <unk> technology , the <unk> technology , the <unk> technology , the <unk> technology .
We had to <unk> <unk> <unk> and so on .
This is a <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> . <unk> of these <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
So they 're all <unk> images from <unk> and were all <unk> <unk> in this way .
And it 's possible to <unk> this <unk> way .
You know , I would never have thought of work to work for <unk> .
It 's very <unk> <unk> to <unk> this kind of <unk> here .
I think we 're going to see that this is a lot of different <unk> of <unk> : from the cell phones to the <unk> <unk> , a number , <unk> together in this environment .
And if I can , I can <unk> to look for the <unk> ones .
Many of them are <unk> by <unk> , <unk> .
There 's a series of photographs -- <unk> .
This is a <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> .
We can go from the <unk> to view of this environment .
The <unk> point is we can do things with social environment . This is <unk> <unk> data from the whole memory of how to <unk> the Earth , from the <unk> from the <unk> of the <unk> of how we <unk> and <unk> all that data together .
All of the pictures become <unk> together , more than the <unk> of the parts .
You have a <unk> of the whole <unk> .
Think about this as the <unk> of the work of <unk> <unk> Earth .
It 's something that <unk> in <unk> complexity as people <unk> it , and the <unk> that we 're going to <unk> with the use .
Their pictures are <unk> with <unk> <unk> from other people .
If somebody is the idea of <unk> all these <unk> <unk> the name , my picture of <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> all those data , and I can use it as a <unk> <unk> to <unk> in space , in that space , in that <unk> , using the <unk> of everybody else , and have a social experience <unk> and <unk> .
Of course , a <unk> of this is extremely <unk> <unk> of every interesting part of the Earth , <unk> not just to <unk> <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> , but from <unk> .
Thank you very much .
Chris Anderson : I understand ? What 's your software ?
<unk> : Yeah . What 's doing is basically <unk> .
It 's creating <unk> , if you want , between images .
And he 's doing it in the <unk> of the <unk> of the images .
The thing becomes very interesting if you think about the <unk> of information <unk> that many of these <unk> images .
As you do a <unk> of images on the web , you <unk> a <unk> and the text on the page has a lot of information about images .
Now , what happens if that picture is going on to all your picture ?
So the amount of <unk> <unk> and the amount of <unk> that <unk> is really huge . It 's a <unk> effect .
CA : <unk> , it 's really incredible . <unk> .
<unk> : I 'll give you a lot .
One of the major <unk> when you <unk> and one of the <unk> research is to be able to live between who has <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> , between who <unk> the <unk> <unk> , <unk> the <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> of plants .
We think that the <unk> <unk> <unk> still beyond the <unk> <unk> , or that the <unk> of <unk> <unk> are still <unk> <unk> , or <unk> , the <unk> still <unk> the <unk> of <unk> , to <unk> the <unk> of <unk> , and that the idea that the world in which we live in in in which , the world doesn 't exist in which is there there is no in a sense of <unk> , but it 's just a <unk> of reality ,
the <unk> of a particular <unk> of <unk> choices that our <unk> has done , well or evil , many <unk> .
And of course , everybody <unk> <unk> .
Everybody <unk> . Everybody <unk> .
We 're <unk> to <unk> <unk> .
We have to <unk> the <unk> of death , so we don 't <unk> if we <unk> and <unk> --
We all have a art .
What <unk> is the <unk> of the song , the <unk> of every culture 's <unk> .
It doesn 't matter that matter the <unk> of <unk> <unk> , or the <unk> of <unk> <unk> , or the <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> , the <unk> of <unk> , or a <unk> in <unk> <unk> .
He was my <unk> of a journey in <unk> a month ago , or a <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> , on <unk> , on the <unk> , the <unk> mother 's <unk> .
All these <unk> <unk> us that there are other ways of <unk> other ways of thinking , other ways of moving around the world .
And if you look at a moment , it 's a concept that can give you hope .
<unk> , the <unk> of <unk> of the world create a <unk> of life <unk> and <unk> the planet is important for the <unk> of the planet as the <unk> <unk> <unk> as <unk> .
And you can think of this <unk> <unk> as a <unk> and you can <unk> the <unk> <unk> of all the <unk> , the <unk> of all the <unk> , dreams , ideas , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> to be from human imagination .
<unk> is the <unk> of humanity .
It 's the <unk> of what we can and what we can be as <unk> species .
And <unk> the <unk> was <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , for example , <unk> that 50 percent of all the species has been or is on the <unk> of <unk> <unk> , or <unk> , in the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> -- in the field of <unk> diversity -- and not even <unk> to <unk> <unk> -- the <unk> diversity .
The <unk> of this is , of course , the <unk> <unk> .
When you 're <unk> <unk> <unk> on this planet .
A language is not only <unk> by a <unk> or <unk> by a <unk> of rules .
A language is the <unk> of the human spirit .
It 's the <unk> with which the <unk> of every culture comes in the world .
Every language is a forest of the mind , a <unk> , a thought , a <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
And of those <unk> <unk> , while we 're sitting here at least , at least half is no longer <unk> in the <unk> of children .
They 're no longer <unk> to children , which means less than <unk> something , they 're <unk> .
What 's more <unk> than being <unk> by <unk> , to be the last to speak a language , the <unk> of <unk> or to <unk> the <unk> of <unk> or to <unk> the <unk> of kids ?
This <unk> <unk> was a <unk> of some of the world every two weeks : every two two weeks , a <unk> <unk> and door with it to <unk> the <unk> language .
And I know some of you might say , " <unk> 't it better . "
The world wouldn 't be a better place if we all know the same language ? " <unk> , then we 're all <unk> . <unk> . <unk> .
<unk> <unk> .
We 're going to <unk> a <unk> thing is that you can 't speak their own language .
I would like to give you a journey through the <unk> --
a little journey in the <unk> to give you a <unk> of what we 're <unk> .
Many of us <unk> that when I say " different ways of <unk> . " I mean , " I really mean different ways of <unk> .
<unk> for example this <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , the <unk> of <unk> , which <unk> to the <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
It 's a <unk> that 's not able to <unk> the blue color from green because the <unk> is <unk> in the <unk> of the forest , which <unk> the <unk> .
They have a <unk> language and a <unk> rule , " <unk> <unk> " : you have to <unk> a person talking different language .
And this has <unk> in the past <unk> , but the <unk> is that in these families <unk> where they 're talking to six or seven <unk> because of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> no <unk> language .
They <unk> to hear and then we start talking .
<unk> one of the most interesting <unk> that I 've lived , the <unk> of <unk> <unk> , an incredible <unk> that has had the first <unk> <unk> in <unk> .
In <unk> , I 've <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> .
They <unk> from the <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> that this <unk> of <unk> <unk> had never seen anything <unk> .
They <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> , and they don 't have <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and they don 't <unk> anything , they <unk> <unk> <unk> , and they <unk> the five <unk> with <unk> .
But <unk> not only <unk> .
They <unk> them with them .
<unk> percent of <unk> <unk> <unk> .
We 're <unk> to eight <unk> and we found two <unk> <unk> , and we found two <unk> that one of them was <unk> so <unk> that he died , and then they <unk> it .
<unk> were able to recognize the animal <unk> from 40 <unk> and to <unk> the species .
<unk> <unk> , and I was <unk> a really interesting job when my <unk> <unk> <unk> me if I wanted to go to <unk> <unk> , I wanted to go to <unk> <unk> between society <unk> to the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
To give a sense of <unk> , I should have to understand the <unk> culture and that <unk> is not <unk> <unk> .
It 's pretty much about a <unk> <unk> of the world .
Very interesting .
If you ask you to <unk> the great <unk> of the world , what would you like to me ?
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , etc . .
A continent comes out , thinking that Africa <unk> doesn 't have <unk> <unk> <unk> . And they 're not <unk> <unk> . And they 're not anything else that the <unk> of these <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
What makes the <unk> interesting <unk> is the <unk> of the <unk> between life and death .
So the <unk> are <unk> the <unk> .
<unk> <unk> can be <unk> by the <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> of the alive <unk> so that for a short moment , the <unk> becomes the <unk> .
So the <unk> <unk> to say , " <unk> <unk> go to <unk> to speak of God .
We <unk> in <unk> and <unk> God . "
And when you 're <unk> , is the spirit that you can <unk> you , how do you can <unk> you evil ?
So they <unk> to these incredible events : <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a fairly strong <unk> of power of the body when it 's <unk> in a state of <unk> .
<unk> all the <unk> that I 've lived with the most <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , in <unk> <unk> .
<unk> of the <unk> civilization that once <unk> on the <unk> <unk> of <unk> in <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> on the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
In a blood continent of blood , this <unk> has never been <unk> by <unk> by <unk> .
In <unk> , they 're <unk> by a <unk> , but their education is <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> are <unk> by <unk> to the families to three or four years , and they live in a world <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> for 18 years .
Two <unk> of nine years <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And for all this time , they get <unk> to values that their society , values that <unk> their <unk> and only their <unk> <unk> <unk> -- or to say the <unk> <unk> .
At the first time , they get <unk> out and for the first time in their life , at the time , at the <unk> of 18 , see a <unk> . And in that moment of the first <unk> , when the sun <unk> the <unk> <unk> , when the sun <unk> <unk> , when the <unk> <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> . <unk> does a <unk> , and he says ,
" <unk> ? <unk> how do I I said .
It 's <unk> . Now it 's <unk> . "
They call them a major <unk> and they say that we , <unk> <unk> , we are the <unk> of the world .
This <unk> level is extremely important .
When we think about <unk> <unk> and the environment <unk> and the old story of <unk> <unk> , which is a <unk> concept in its <unk> or maybe <unk> <unk> and say that these <unk> are more to the Earth than we .
<unk> <unk> are not <unk> <unk> <unk> .
There is no space for these things in the <unk> <unk> or in <unk> <unk> <unk> , but for time and <unk> , they created a <unk> of the Earth <unk> , they created a <unk> of <unk> <unk> , but on a <unk> <unk> , but on a <unk> <unk> , the concept that the Earth can live only because it 's <unk> from human consciousness .
What does it mean ?
I mean that a <unk> of the <unk> that <unk> <unk> that the mountain is a <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> that <unk> its <unk> is going to be a <unk> different <unk> with the mountain or the <unk> , or that <unk> to <unk> a mountain of <unk> that <unk> that <unk> a mountain of <unk> to be <unk> .
That 's a <unk> of a spirit or a <unk> <unk> is <unk> .
What 's interesting is the <unk> that <unk> the relationship between <unk> and natural world .
I grew up in the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> to be <unk> .
And that made me a human being different from my friends who believe that <unk> are the <unk> of <unk> and the <unk> <unk> of <unk> and the <unk> <unk> that live in the world , <unk> that are <unk> in the world , <unk> that <unk> in the <unk> .
If we <unk> to <unk> that these <unk> can actually create different , we could start understanding some of the <unk> <unk> . We can do this <unk> .
I took this picture to <unk> in <unk> <unk> .
Maybe some of you have heard about <unk> , the most powerful <unk> of the <unk> <unk> .
What makes the <unk> is not the potential of the <unk> <unk> , but his <unk> . It 's <unk> by two elements .
On one side , this <unk> <unk> that has a series of <unk> , <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
<unk> the only <unk> is a <unk> <unk> that <unk> a little bit , the <unk> , but it 's <unk> with a <unk> of a <unk> 's family said <unk> .
This <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , very similar to <unk> , <unk> .
If you 're going to see the <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> that they 're doing from a different <unk> of species , <unk> it <unk> .
<unk> that <unk> on the <unk> is a little bit of how to be <unk> by a <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> on a sea of electricity . <unk> 't create a <unk> of electricity . <unk> doesn 't create a <unk> of reality .
I often <unk> with my <unk> , Richard <unk> <unk> , the man who <unk> was <unk> , with his discovery of <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> my <unk> is not <unk> these <unk> as <unk> because if you 're done you can 't tell anybody to be <unk> . <unk> 't be <unk> . It 's <unk> can 't be <unk> because they 're <unk> by a <unk> that is , <unk> <unk> .
It 's possible to <unk> only if you <unk> with other <unk> <unk> that <unk> .
Now it 's the beautiful one : the <unk> that are <unk> in this <unk> are <unk> , the same <unk> that are <unk> to <unk> . The question <unk> <unk> : in a <unk> of <unk> species , how do these <unk> to <unk> two <unk> not that , but if you <unk> in this way , they create a <unk> version that 's <unk> that 's <unk> to the <unk> of the parts ?
We use the great <unk> of <unk> and <unk> , which can <unk> <unk> .
But if you go to the <unk> , we 'll be " The plants are there . "
What does it mean ?
This <unk> , the <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , who <unk> <unk> in the forest , and our eyes <unk> in the same species .
If <unk> like <unk> their <unk> <unk> to <unk> " <unk> " <unk> " <unk> " <unk> " <unk> " <unk> " <unk> " No . "
The solution is : they take the <unk> <unk> into a night of the moon and <unk> <unk> with a different <unk> .
And that 's not <unk> <unk> , but it 's much more interesting than <unk> <unk> .
Now , [ <unk> ] the problem is that even the ones of us that are <unk> to the heart <unk> <unk> them , but in a way to the <unk> of history than in the real world , and <unk> .
In fact , the <unk> century , in 300 years , not <unk> <unk> for his <unk> or his <unk> <unk> , but rather like the <unk> was where we <unk> and <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> the mass <unk> of the <unk> diversity and <unk> and <unk> the <unk> of the planet . Now the problem is not the change .
All <unk> through the <unk> have been <unk> in a <unk> for new possibilities of life .
And the problem is not technology .
<unk> <unk> don 't have <unk> to be <unk> when they put <unk> <unk> and <unk> like how <unk> don 't have <unk> to be <unk> when they <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
It 's not the change or technology that <unk> the <unk> of <unk> . It 's the power .
The <unk> <unk> of <unk> .
And if you look at the world , you 'll see that these are not <unk> <unk> to <unk> .
They 're <unk> creatures , <unk> <unk> creatures out of the <unk> forces that go beyond their <unk> of <unk> .
<unk> that <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> --
a <unk> <unk> <unk> , in <unk> <unk> , a <unk> that has lived in the forest to a generation ago , and now <unk> to the <unk> and <unk> on the <unk> of <unk> , where you can see the <unk> <unk> from the <unk> <unk> , which <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> , where the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , where the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> ,
We 're <unk> to <unk> the <unk> with the <unk> <unk> to the forest .
or in the case of <unk> , are the diseases that are <unk> with the <unk> of <unk> .
If we <unk> on the <unk> of the <unk> , where I 'm doing a lot of research , you 'll see the <unk> of the <unk> of politics .
As a <unk> the <unk> , the physics of a <unk> , is <unk> <unk> <unk> , but <unk> , the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> of life of a <unk> , not only is <unk> , but <unk> <unk> in certain <unk> , because it 's <unk> <unk> in certain <unk> , because it 's part of development .
And you can 't understand the <unk> of the <unk> until you 're part of the <unk> .
I <unk> the <unk> miles from <unk> in China , through the <unk> <unk> , <unk> to <unk> with a young <unk> , but only come to <unk> , I realized what the <unk> behind .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> million people <unk> from <unk> during the <unk> <unk> .
The father of this guy was <unk> at <unk> <unk> .
That means that it 's been <unk> at the time of the Chinese <unk> .
<unk> <unk> is <unk> with <unk> <unk> during the <unk> who brought the <unk> in <unk> .
My mother was <unk> and his <unk> was to be <unk> .
It was taken to <unk> <unk> at the age of two <unk> years <unk> under his <unk> because he couldn 't have to live without him .
The <unk> , who did the same , was <unk> in <unk> <unk> .
One day he <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> and , for this <unk> , was <unk> to <unk> <unk> for seven years .
The <unk> of <unk> can be <unk> , but the <unk> of <unk> is from <unk> present .
And then , it 's <unk> to a choice .
Do you have to live in the <unk> world or we want to <unk> the <unk> of diversity ?
The great <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , before die said that his greatest fear was that , in our <unk> to this <unk> <unk> vision of human imagination , not only <unk> the whole <unk> of human imagination to a <unk> <unk> of human imagination , but a day we <unk> from a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that there were other possibilities .
And it 's <unk> to <unk> that our species is <unk> for <unk> years .
The <unk> <unk> , which has given us to agriculture , which has <unk> us to the <unk> of the <unk> with the <unk> of <unk> with the <unk> of <unk> , creating the <unk> of <unk> , and we 're talking about <unk> years ago .
The <unk> world has to <unk> 300 years .
That <unk> story is not <unk> to me that we have the answers to all the challenges that we 're going to <unk> in <unk> to come .
When we do these <unk> <unk> of the world is asked what it means to be human , <unk> with <unk> different <unk> .
And it 's in these answers that we all <unk> the possibility to be what we are , a <unk> species , which has to <unk> the <unk> and all the <unk> can <unk> . And there are great moments of <unk> .
I <unk> this picture on the north of <unk> <unk> , when I went to <unk> <unk> with <unk> , and this man , <unk> , <unk> me , and this man , <unk> me the wonderful story of his <unk> .
The <unk> government has not been <unk> with the <unk> <unk> and in the <unk> to <unk> our <unk> , we <unk> them in <unk> .
The <unk> of this man <unk> <unk> .
The family , <unk> for his life , <unk> <unk> away all the <unk> , and all his <unk> .
You want to know that <unk> don 't <unk> the cold , <unk> .
The <unk> of <unk> were made of <unk> fish <unk> in skin <unk> .
The <unk> of this man didn 't <unk> by night or <unk> <unk> .
It <unk> away , it <unk> the <unk> <unk> in skin of <unk> and <unk> in your hand . When I did it <unk> , he <unk> it , he <unk> it into it .
He <unk> <unk> on the <unk> of this <unk> <unk> , and when <unk> <unk> <unk> , he <unk> a dog .
He <unk> the dog and created a <unk> , with the <unk> <unk> has created a <unk> , he <unk> a <unk> , he <unk> a <unk> , <unk> <unk> in <unk> .
Do you want to talk about <unk> with nothing ?
<unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> government <unk> the total <unk> of a <unk> area of a larger <unk> of California and <unk> <unk> .
It 's their new <unk> . It 's called <unk> .
It 's a <unk> <unk> . It <unk> all the resources .
One <unk> example of how a <unk> can <unk> with his <unk> .
And , I think it 's pretty <unk> at least to the people of us has been in these <unk> <unk> on the planet , <unk> that are not at all <unk> .
For someone is home .
<unk> <unk> of human imagination that <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of hope of these children , become part of the hope of the <unk> of hope .
<unk> , we <unk> <unk> <unk> we are <unk> that <unk> will never <unk> to anything .
I think <unk> --
<unk> is not <unk> , but we believe that stories can change the world , and maybe we are the best <unk> to tell the stories of the world . Every month our site <unk> <unk> million <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> our <unk> <unk> .
Our <unk> are <unk> by millions of people .
Our work is <unk> in <unk> to bring our public in places of <unk> <unk> from which <unk> <unk> from which <unk> <unk> as <unk> and , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> the <unk> of <unk> : the world of <unk> in diversity , and we have to find a <unk> of life in the <unk> world . And we have to find a <unk> of life in a <unk> world .
where the <unk> of all <unk> <unk> to our <unk> <unk> .
Thank you .
I 'm going to talk about some things I wrote in this book that I hope you 've heard some <unk> , and you 'll know , in case you don 't <unk> them .
I want to start with what I call the <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> of what ?
The <unk> <unk> of all the society is <unk> . The <unk> <unk> <unk> , " If we want to <unk> the <unk> of our citizens . " The way to do it is to <unk> <unk> . "
The reason is , on one side , in fact that freedom is in itself , is <unk> , useful , <unk> for humans .
Another is in fact that if we 're <unk> , we <unk> , we can act to <unk> to their <unk> , without no one <unk> in our <unk> , without any <unk> in our own own .
The way to <unk> the freedom is to <unk> the choice .
more choices people , more <unk> , and more <unk> than people are <unk> , and more the freedom , more than their <unk> .
This is , <unk> , <unk> <unk> in society that no one <unk> <unk> in <unk> .
And it 's also <unk> <unk> in our lives .
I 'll show you some examples of what a few examples of what progress has made possible .
This is my <unk> . It 's not particularly big .
I <unk> a simple note on <unk> to <unk> .
In my <unk> , there are <unk> <unk> , without <unk> the 10 <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and the 12 <unk> <unk> you can buy for you to make a huge number of <unk> in <unk> <unk> that no one of the <unk> <unk> is <unk> .
That 's what the <unk> is what the <unk> is .
Then you go to the <unk> store to buy a <unk> : <unk> , <unk> , radio , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
And in this single <unk> <unk> , there 's a big number of <unk> <unk> .
We can make six and a half million different <unk> using the <unk> that there are in one store .
<unk> <unk> that there is <unk> .
<unk> <unk> : the world of <unk> .
Once when I was a child , you could get all the <unk> <unk> <unk> , to <unk> who were <unk> by <unk> <unk> .
They <unk> the phone , not <unk> it .
And a <unk> of that , between the other , was that the phone would ever <unk> .
These days are gone .
We 're now a <unk> <unk> of <unk> , especially between cell phones .
Here 's the mobile phones .
My <unk> is in the middle , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , and <unk> for the <unk> <unk> .
If you don 't have seen yet in the <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> , you 're well well <unk> .
And what 's at the end of the people in <unk> and <unk> this question . And you know , what the answer is , " No . "
It 's not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn 't <unk> things .
So , in other <unk> of life that are much more important than <unk> , <unk> the same <unk> of choices .
<unk> <unk> : It doesn 't happen in the United States that you 're <unk> from <unk> and the <unk> you have to do what you have to do .
Instead , <unk> from <unk> , and the <unk> says , " OK , could do it , or <unk> , " he 's like , we could do it . "
You <unk> them , " <unk> , what do you do ? "
And the <unk> says , " <unk> has these <unk> and these <unk> , and <unk> has these <unk> and these <unk> . "
" What do you do ? "
And you 're saying , " <unk> if she was me , what would you like to me , what would you like ? "
And the <unk> , " But I 'm not her . "
We call it a <unk> " <unk> <unk> " , " <unk> <unk> " , " which makes it look like a very good thing .
But it 's not that a <unk> the weight and the responsibility for someone who knows something , <unk> the <unk> , to <unk> the <unk> , to <unk> , to <unk> something else that doesn 't know -- and it 's <unk> , and so not in <unk> to make the patient ,
There 's a huge <unk> of <unk> products , <unk> to people like me and you , if you think about it doesn 't make sense , because we can 't <unk> .
But if we can 't <unk> , why do we <unk> them ?
The answer is they want to <unk> we call the <unk> to <unk> <unk> .
And we 're going to <unk> that as we 're <unk> to a question of , as you see in this <unk> . " We don 't want to <unk> kids . <unk> their sex at the right time . It 's not going to be a <unk> . We don 't have a <unk> .
And we can <unk> how many times we <unk> .
That means that every <unk> , the <unk> , you have to decide that kind of person , you have to decide what kind of person .
<unk> to the family and <unk> , a <unk> perspective , and <unk> almost to anyone , was that you 'll <unk> the <unk> as soon as possible , and you can get to kids , and they <unk> to the <unk> as soon as possible .
The only real choice was with who , not when , and even what to do after .
<unk> , it 's really to play .
They 're <unk> to <unk> , <unk> , and they <unk> their 20 percent in less work than at a time .
And not because they 're less <unk> , not because they 're less <unk> .
But why are they <unk> , they 're going to <unk> , " <unk> <unk> or not ? <unk> it ? "
" <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> ? I have to think about <unk> or <unk> ? "
They 're <unk> <unk> .
And they try to answer these questions , even if this <unk> doesn 't <unk> the <unk> that we 're <unk> and not <unk> the <unk> that we 're <unk> and not get a <unk> <unk> to my <unk> .
And they have to do that . They 're important questions .
Now , the work : we 're <unk> , as <unk> <unk> , because the technology allows us to work every minute , every day , from every corner of the planet , <unk> from <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , there 's a <unk> , and I won 't tell anybody what , where the <unk> works .
I don 't tell you , because I want to use it .
What it means , this incredible freedom of choice that we have about work ? It 's we have to decide , if we have to work or not .
We can go to see our son to <unk> , with the cell phone in a <unk> , the <unk> in the other , and the <unk> , <unk> .
And even if they 're all <unk> , every minute we see our son will <unk> the <unk> , we 're also <unk> , " I have to answer this call ? "
" I have to answer this <unk> ? I have you letter ? "
And even when the answer is " no " , " that 's all the experience of your son very different from what it would be in other conditions .
So , from any of us look , little things and big objects , and big objects , life is a question of choices .
Once the world was this : <unk> , there were some possibility , but not everything was a question of choice .
The world of today is to this : The <unk> is , " Is it a <unk> , or <unk> ? "
The answer is <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> we know all know , so I 'm going to talk about the <unk> .
We 're going to <unk> two effects of people .
The first one , <unk> , is that <unk> instead of <unk> .
With many <unk> between which you 're going to be very difficult to do it .
I 'll give you an <unk> <unk> : a study <unk> on <unk> <unk> .
A <unk> of my <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> society , with about a million <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> <unk> .
What she found is that for every 10 solutions that are <unk> , the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> two percent .
With 50 <unk> <unk> , there 's 10 percent in less than when they 're <unk> <unk> only <unk> at it . Why ?
Because with 50 <unk> between which to choose , is to <unk> difficult , and the choice is <unk> to <unk> .
And <unk> , and still <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and of course <unk> , and of course <unk> will never get .
<unk> that doesn 't only mean that these <unk> <unk> <unk> food to <unk> because they will not have enough money , it also wants to say that the decision is so <unk> that we <unk> the <unk> of work .
They 're not <unk> , they 're <unk> to <unk> <unk> for <unk> year from <unk> <unk> , which would be well well well <unk> .
So <unk> is a <unk> of <unk> to have <unk> choices .
And I think we 're going to <unk> the world like this .
" And then , to end the <unk> : <unk> , <unk> or <unk> ? "
You 're just going to be the right decision , if it 's <unk> , right ?
You don 't want to choose the wrong wrong , and <unk> the wrong <unk> .
So that 's the first effect . The second is that even if we can <unk> the <unk> and make a choice , at the end of the <unk> and make a choice , at the end is that we 're less <unk> by which you can .
And that for several reasons .
One of these is that with many <unk> between <unk> , if you <unk> one and it 's not perfect , it 's easy to imagine that they could make a different choice that would be better . And what happens is that the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> from <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> from <unk> ,
even when it was a <unk> decision .
The more choices there are , more choices to <unk> than any <unk> that 's <unk> of <unk> .
<unk> , there 's what <unk> call .
Dan <unk> has <unk> very well <unk> like the value that we give things to things that we give things to what <unk> <unk> .
<unk> rest , when there are many <unk> , it 's easy to <unk> the <unk> of <unk> <unk> and be less <unk> than the <unk> of <unk> that is choice .
Here 's an example . I 'm <unk> with everybody that 's no New York .
But that 's what 's probably <unk> .
There 's this <unk> to the <unk> .
A <unk> of <unk> .
<unk> <unk> . <unk> day . It 's all for them .
I don 't <unk> anything . But what he thinks is , " Well , <unk> , <unk> , is <unk> . "
" All my <unk> <unk> <unk> . "
" <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . "
And it <unk> two weeks from the idea that 's <unk> -- every day -- the possibility of <unk> where it wants to be .
The <unk> <unk> the <unk> for what we have , even when the choice was <unk> .
And more the <unk> we have <unk> , the more the <unk> <unk> is <unk> to how to <unk> .
Here 's another example .
This <unk> tells us a lot of things .
It 's about the moment , and maybe a living living .
But the most important thing is that anything you 're going to be , you 're going to not do others .
The things that don 't <unk> have many <unk> that can make less <unk> what we do .
<unk> <unk> : <unk> <unk> <unk> .
I tried it on my skin <unk> a new couple of <unk> .
It was almost always <unk> .
Once the <unk> were only one , <unk> them and <unk> <unk> , were <unk> , only after <unk> a life <unk> , and they would be <unk> , only after <unk> a life <unk> and <unk> a lot of <unk> , <unk> to go well .
So , I started to <unk> a couple of them , when the <unk> were gone , and I said , " I need a couple of <unk> , this is my <unk> . "
The <unk> said , " <unk> wants to <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> ? "
Do you want them with <unk> or <unk> ? " <unk> " or " <unk> " ?
" <unk> wants it to <unk> ? "
" <unk> wants to <unk> or <unk> ? <unk> <unk> <unk> -- " <unk> to <unk> .
I was <unk> , and after a little bit I could say , " I want the guy that was the only guy . " He didn 't think it was , so for a time , I 'm all <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , with the best <unk> I ever had .
It was the <unk> . With all that choice I had <unk> the best .
But I 'm going to get worse .
Why ? I wrote a whole book to <unk> .
The reason I was worse is that with all that choice my <unk> were <unk> , the <unk> <unk> to be <unk> .
I had <unk> <unk> . I didn 't <unk> anything <unk> <unk> when I just <unk> a guy , but when I <unk> 100 different , <unk> , at least a kind of <unk> , at least a kind of perfect .
What I had <unk> was good , but not perfect .
After I <unk> that <unk> with what I was <unk> in <unk> to <unk> .
The <unk> of <unk> in the lives of people don 't do that <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> itself .
And this <unk> <unk> , even when the results are good .
No one in the world of <unk> if you realize .
Because if you <unk> , I don 't know what I 'm talking about .
The <unk> truth is more to this .
" It was better when he was worse , " The reason he was better when he was worse is that when he was worse is even though he was worse than the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> , in the world that we live in -- <unk> , <unk> citizens with the <unk> of <unk> -- the <unk> we can <unk> is that things are <unk> to the <unk> of <unk> .
You 've never <unk> <unk> <unk> , because your <unk> , my <unk> , <unk> .
The <unk> of happiness -- what you 're here -- is , " <unk> <unk> " Yes , you want to be <unk> . "
I mean , little <unk> moment -- who are really <unk> and my wife is really <unk> .
I couldn 't do better , I didn 't <unk> .
But <unk> is not always a <unk> thing .
<unk> , a <unk> of a couple of <unk> <unk> when there 's just that kind of <unk> is that when you 're not <unk> , and I 'll give you , " Why ? "
" Who is <unk> ? " <unk> is <unk> .
The world is the <unk> . What can I do ?
When there are hundreds of kinds of <unk> , and you 'll give you a <unk> , and you 'll give you who 's the <unk> , it 's clear that you 're .
We could do better .
With hundreds of <unk> available , there are no <unk> for <unk> .
So when people make decisions , even if the <unk> is <unk> , they 're <unk> and give them <unk> to their own .
In the last few years , the <unk> is <unk> in the <unk> world .
I think a <unk> <unk> -- not the only , but important -- of this <unk> of <unk> is just that people have <unk> experiences because the standard are too <unk> .
And when they have to <unk> this situation that <unk> is them .
So the final result is that in general we 're better , <unk> , but we 'll get worse .
Let me tell you .
This is the <unk> <unk> , what we all take good for good and it 's completely <unk> . It 's not true .
There 's no <unk> that a little bit of choice is better than <unk> at all , but that doesn 't think a lot of choice is better than a little bit .
There 's a <unk> value , <unk> . I don 't know what it is .
But I 'm quite sure we 've <unk> from a piece of the level where the choices <unk> our life .
Now , from the <unk> <unk> -- I 've been <unk> -- from a <unk> <unk> , the <unk> is <unk> .
What allows all this choice in <unk> society is the <unk> material .
There are many places in the world , and you 'll be <unk> <unk> , where the problem is not that they have <unk> choice .
The problem is they have too <unk> .
So the <unk> I 'm talking about is a <unk> <unk> of <unk> , <unk> society .
And what <unk> does is this : <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to you yesterday about how those <unk> and <unk> <unk> to <unk> are <unk> . It 's a <unk> of money .
I mean , these choices , <unk> and <unk> , not that they 're just <unk> .
They 're <unk> <unk> .
They do worse .
If we 're a little bit of what in our society allows them to be <unk> in the people have too few people , it wouldn 't only be their life to <unk> , but our own .
This is what <unk> call a <unk> <unk> .
A <unk> of income is good for everybody -- not only to poor -- because of this choice in <unk> that we 're <unk> .
And to <unk> , " <unk> , you can become everything you want to --
<unk> , people in culture , <unk> , " What 's going to happen ? "
" It 's <unk> that you can 't do anything in a <unk> of glass . "
" A <unk> imagination , a <unk> vision of the world --
and <unk> I <unk> it so , at the beginning .
But then , <unk> , I realized that that the fish knows that fish knows that fish <unk> <unk> .
Because the reality of <unk> is that if you <unk> the <unk> , so that " everything is possible , " you can 't <unk> the freedom . They <unk> .
If you <unk> the <unk> so that it would <unk> to <unk> the <unk> .
<unk> the <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Everybody needs a <unk> .
This is almost certainly too <unk> , maybe even for the fish , and certainly for the fish , and certainly .
But the <unk> of some <unk> <unk> is a <unk> for <unk> and , <unk> , for <unk> .
Thank you for heart .
