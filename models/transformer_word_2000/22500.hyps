<unk> year I showed these <unk> to <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> , which for almost three million years has had the size of the United States , <unk> the United States , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> ,
We 're going to <unk> the problem because it 's not <unk> the ice <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> <unk> is , in a sense , the heart of climate system .
They <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
The next <unk> is going to be a <unk> <unk> on the <unk> of the last 25 years .
The <unk> <unk> are <unk> in red .
You see , you know , it 's <unk> up to the blue <unk> .
That 's the ice in <unk> , which <unk> in the summer .
You can see that the <unk> ice <unk> , five years or more , is like the blood , which here <unk> from the body .
In 25 years , it 's been the way , in the way .
This is a problem because the <unk> <unk> is <unk> around the ocean <unk> where there are enormous <unk> of <unk> that , <unk> , are <unk> in <unk> from the <unk> .
<unk> at the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , that <unk> <unk> could be <unk> , <unk> this point of not <unk> .
In some <unk> , you 're going to <unk> the <unk> is already <unk> by the water .
The <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> ! <unk> : she 's good . <unk> : She 's good . The question is if you <unk> .
A reason is that this <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> from the north .
This is a river in <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> had never <unk> <unk> similar .
This is the <unk> river , in the <unk> of <unk> .
If you want to know how the sea level to <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , here is where the sea is where the sea .
These <unk> are <unk> <unk> .
On the other side of the planet : <unk> , the largest <unk> of ice on the planet .
<unk> month , the <unk> scientists have <unk> that the ice of the ice is in <unk> , and that <unk> <unk> , is particularly <unk> in the <unk> .
<unk> at six feet of the <unk> , like <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , the third largest <unk> of ice , you see new <unk> , which a few years ago were <unk> .
<unk> percent of the world population <unk> water from that <unk> .
<unk> <unk> : This <unk> is the source water water <unk> of this city .
The <unk> is <unk> .
But when you <unk> , the same thing happens to the water .
<unk> California <unk> on <unk> <unk> <unk> is 40 percent .
The <unk> <unk> are in the crisis .
The <unk> , as you read , are <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> in the world leads to a <unk> increase in <unk> .
<unk> <unk> are <unk> to a <unk> out of normal and not <unk> .
<unk> times more <unk> over the last 30 years than <unk> <unk> .
This is a <unk> of all <unk> .
If you look at it in the <unk> context if you can see the <unk> .
In the last five years we have 70 million <unk> of CO2 every 24 hours -- 25 million <unk> in the oceans .
Look at the <unk> <unk> , <unk> , from <unk> , to <unk> , and on both parts of the <unk> <unk> , where there 's a <unk> <unk> of oxygen in the oceans .
The <unk> of global warming , <unk> , <unk> , which is 20 percent , is the use of <unk> <unk> .
The oil is a problem , and <unk> is even worse .
The United States is one of the two countries with the <unk> emissions , together .
And it 's <unk> to build a lot of other <unk> <unk> .
But we 're starting to a <unk> of direction .
These are the <unk> projects over the last few years and some <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
<unk> , there 's a <unk> politics in our country .
The <unk> of <unk> and oil <unk> have <unk> million dollars in the last year to <unk> <unk> , which is a <unk> .
I 'm going to give me something --
<unk> <unk> , in <unk> , where I live , there was a <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
You may have seen it on <unk> .
This is the second largest flow of <unk> in America .
It 's happened around <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> of one of <unk> <unk> was this .
<unk> : <unk> ♫ ♫ <unk> the <unk> is a <unk> and happy guy .
It 's <unk> here in America , and it makes our economy .
<unk> <unk> is always <unk> .
It 's <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> it .
Al <unk> : <unk> here is a lot of <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The largest society <unk> on the <unk> is <unk> <unk> . This is <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> , <unk> -- Al <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> -- don 't know what they 're talking about .
Al <unk> : So the <unk> for the <unk> <unk> has <unk> two <unk> .
This is one of them , one .
<unk> : <unk> : <unk> <unk> we see the climate change as a <unk> <unk> to our business .
So , that 's our <unk> is <unk> a big amount of money in a <unk> <unk> to make public and <unk> the truth on <unk> .
In fact , <unk> is not <unk> .
We think it 's <unk> -- it also has a good <unk> .
So we don 't <unk> about climate change .
We want to do .
<unk> : <unk> : <unk> <unk> -- you 've heard about it a lot .
So , I <unk> a <unk> in a <unk> structure for how much <unk> is about <unk> <unk> .
<unk> ! <unk> are a little bit <unk> , but this is the sound of <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> is between <unk> <unk> of global warming , but <unk> technology <unk> that you see everything .
You have a look : this is the <unk> technology <unk> .
Al <unk> : <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to the economic issue and the national security .
<unk> : <unk> America is in the crisis ; America is in the national security , the crisis .
The <unk> that <unk> all : our <unk> <unk> <unk> , like <unk> <unk> and oil .
Now , there 's a new , <unk> solution to <unk> .
<unk> America : 100 percent of <unk> energy , in 10 years .
A plan to <unk> America at work , more <unk> <unk> , and help <unk> the global warming .
<unk> , a solution that we 're going to solve our problems .
<unk> America . <unk> more .
Al <unk> : This is the last one .
<unk> : <unk> : It 's about <unk> energy to America .
One of the most <unk> ways to <unk> end up with the <unk> that <unk> our planet .
<unk> : The future is here . <unk> , a new network <unk> .
<unk> <unk> 2 : <unk> <unk> for jobs .
<unk> : America . It 's time to be <unk> .
<unk> : A old <unk> <unk> says , " If you want to go to <unk> , you go to alone .
If you want to go to the far , you go together . "
We have to go far , quickly .
Thank you very much .
<unk> year at TED I did a <unk> on <unk> .
And I 'm going to try to <unk> about how the car works .
So here we go . And for those that the other time , there were no one , the <unk> is the largest scientific experiment ever <unk> -- <unk> kilometers .
His task is to <unk> the conditions that were in the universe less than a <unk> <unk> in the universe -- until <unk> million times a second .
All of that is just <unk> .
This is the car under <unk> .
They <unk> these <unk> <unk> into the <unk> .
This is what I work . It 's called <unk> -- it 's <unk> <unk> feet and has a <unk> <unk> .
This is a <unk> picture of <unk> in the building so you can see the <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> last year we <unk> the car for the first time .
And this picture was <unk> by <unk> .
It was <unk> <unk> <unk> in control .
It 's a picture of the first <unk> of the particles that had made all of the <unk> , <unk> , with a part of the <unk> , and we <unk> particles inside the <unk> .
In other words , when you <unk> the <unk> 10 <unk> , you know , you know , the car <unk> , which is a big <unk> .
I don 't know if it was this <unk> to make us more or this , when somebody <unk> on Google and <unk> that the page was this .
That means we have had a <unk> impact beyond that scientific one .
<unk> a week later , there was a problem with the car , we had to these <unk> here -- these <unk> <unk> .
These <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> when the car works at the <unk> of the <unk> .
Now , the <unk> between you <unk> and <unk> , " It 's not true . I 'm too <unk> . "
And instead they can do it because when they 're very <unk> to get the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
So , at least <unk> degrees <unk> , at a temperature <unk> at the <unk> of the space between stars , these <unk> can bring that <unk> .
In one of the <unk> between the <unk> of <unk> in the <unk> , there was a <unk> <unk> .
So the <unk> <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
This was the result .
Now , this is even more <unk> if you think that these <unk> <unk> <unk> over 20 <unk> , and that you 've got about 30 <unk> .
They <unk> about 50 <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , what we did .
We have them <unk> and <unk> .
Now they 're all going to get their <unk> place .
<unk> the end of <unk> the <unk> is going to be new <unk> .
We <unk> it , and we try to get <unk> data to <unk> or <unk> , and so on our <unk> to find out what the universe are going to <unk> the universe .
Now , of course , in a certain way , these <unk> <unk> <unk> the value of science and engineering engineering of <unk> . It 's easy to <unk> .
I think the fact that it 's so hard , the fact that that we go beyond <unk> , I think this is the value of things like <unk> .
I want to end with the words of a <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , which , in <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> experiments of his <unk> , his <unk> was Michael <unk> , said , " It 's a lot of <unk> to the progress of the human mind as the ideas of science as the ideas of science , that our <unk> are <unk> , and there are no new <unk> of nature , and that we 're not <unk> by <unk> . "
Thank you .
I want to start <unk> to <unk> it to <unk> with <unk> .
And as I was <unk> and <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> is <unk> <unk> to the way that most of the world around us .
So , from <unk> <unk> from the <unk> of our <unk> with <unk> objects , <unk> with my <unk> <unk> , and my <unk> <unk> , I started <unk> : " And if we use a computer , instead of just having a computer , you 've just got a computer <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> with both hands ,
and <unk> to our <unk> ?
The question was so interesting to try to explore the answer , building the answer , building the <unk> .
In a few words , a <unk> is a <unk> computer as a <unk> .
In a few words , a <unk> is a <unk> computer as a <unk> .
You can <unk> with your hand , you can <unk> them , and they have a screen and they have a screen and they have a screen and they have a screen and a <unk> radio .
But <unk> , they 're <unk> , like <unk> , you can just <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> are the <unk> of a new <unk> of tools to <unk> the digital information .
And as they become more <unk> , <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> , others , and as they become more <unk> , <unk> of the same movement , other , of how we can <unk> them , and <unk> <unk> .
Let 's start with some simple example .
This <unk> is <unk> to show you about video : if you <unk> it in a direction , the video <unk> so , if you go to the other side back .
These <unk> <unk> are <unk> of others .
If you <unk> them , you 're <unk> to what they are .
If they 're <unk> , you can <unk> it and they can <unk> it a little bit .
If they 're <unk> , you can <unk> it and they can <unk> it a little bit .
They also have their movement and <unk> .
We then <unk> that one of the interesting <unk> of the <unk> was the able to use it to <unk> common on the data , for example , <unk> <unk> , which is a color as if it was a <unk> .
In this case , we have three <unk> <unk> as a <unk> <unk> , and I can <unk> them to <unk> the color in the central , where they <unk> .
and I can <unk> it to <unk> color in central , where you 're <unk> .
If you get too much , we can <unk> a little bit to the place .
I also have to be able to <unk> , as <unk> , mathematics and <unk> where people can <unk> things , and they <unk> the results immediately .
Now I 'm --
This is a <unk> sequence I do with a <unk> program .
Here we have a <unk> game , which is half between <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> , at every <unk> , you <unk> a letter to <unk> , on every <unk> , <unk> , at every <unk> , and as I <unk> <unk> , he <unk> up to <unk> words <unk> on a <unk> .
Then , after about 30 seconds , you get , and you have a new <unk> of <unk> and new possibilities to try .
Thank you .
Here 's the kids <unk> in <unk> <unk> at <unk> <unk> , I did in a way I <unk> them and I <unk> them up and I <unk> a video .
They 're very <unk> .
And one of the interesting things of this kind of <unk> is that you don 't have to give people a lot of <unk> .
I just say , " <unk> of words , " and they know exactly what to do .
Here are other people who <unk> it .
This is our <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
It was just wanted to <unk> .
It was just <unk> , for him .
Now , this is a <unk> of a <unk> <unk> .
We had to build a tool for the <unk> of the <unk> . He 's <unk> .
It can <unk> new characters in the scene , <unk> their <unk> .
It can <unk> new characters in the scene , <unk> their <unk> .
So , this is , you 're doing the sun .
<unk> : The sun is <unk> .
David <unk> : Now he 's brought a <unk> in the <unk> .
<unk> : The <unk> <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> work ! Yes .
So <unk> <unk> and <unk> can <unk> the characters <unk> --
<unk> : <unk> !
-- I 'll tell you about your story .
<unk> : <unk> !
<unk> : It 's a story with the open , and you can decide what it 's going to happen .
<unk> : It 's a story with the open , and you can decide what it 's going to happen .
<unk> : <unk> , <unk> .
<unk> : The last example I have time to show you is a <unk> , <unk> <unk> and <unk> music .
It 's a tool that has done recently , to <unk> and music .
The <unk> here are <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> .
<unk> of these has four different <unk> , and you can choose which to use .
And you can also <unk> these <unk> in a sequence of <unk> to your <unk> .
And I just <unk> by doing a <unk> , " and a <unk> sequence . "
These are effects that you can control live , like <unk> and <unk> .
I <unk> it to a particular sound and then <unk> to <unk> .
And then there are the <unk> effects of <unk> , and then you <unk> to the entire sequence .
It 's how it works .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> <unk> a series , " <unk> a <unk> , " <unk> in a series , the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk>
Now , you 're going to have a <unk> line .
<unk> : <unk> : Now I 'm going to <unk> of <unk> --
<unk> : <unk> : And now I 'm going to <unk> the <unk> to the <unk> , so I can control the effect of the live .
<unk> : <unk> : I can <unk> the entire sequence time by one side or another .
<unk> : <unk> : And now I 'm going to get the <unk> to make more <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> : I can <unk> the <unk> <unk> .
So I don 't have to tell you before , but I can <unk> it , it 's <unk> .
And now , finally , I can <unk> the whole <unk> sequence on the left the <unk> <unk> .
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is to build new <unk> <unk> <unk> to how our brain work and body .
And today , I 've had time to show you one of the results of this way , and some <unk> that we 're going to get out of the lab .
The concept I want to <unk> is that it 's going to take this new <unk> of objects to <unk> media , that <unk> information in our world in the way we want .
Thank you very much .
I don 't see the time of talking to all of you .
I 'm a <unk> .
<unk> books is my <unk> , but it 's more than this , of course .
It 's also love and the <unk> of my life .
And I don 't look like that .
But , I said , something particular has been <unk> in my life and in my career , and in my career , who brought me to <unk> the whole relationship with this work .
The particular thing is I <unk> wrote this book , this <unk> called " <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
And the result is that everywhere you have now , people <unk> me as if I was <unk> .
<unk> -- <unk> , <unk> , <unk> !
I 'm <unk> to me now , and they say , " You don 't fear of not to be able to do better ?
You don 't have fear to keep writing for all life to be able to create a book that can <unk> to somebody ? "
Can you <unk> to somebody ? "
It 's <unk> , you know .
But it could be worse , except that I remember over 20 years ago , when I started to say people -- a <unk> -- I wanted to be a <unk> .
I <unk> the same <unk> <unk> by fear .
And people say , " Don 't you want to be successful ? "
You don 't feel that the <unk> of <unk> <unk> you ?
You don 't fear to do this <unk> for all life , without anything that is ever out and die on a <unk> of dreams with the <unk> <unk> 's mouth with the <unk> <unk> of <unk> ?
So , you know .
The answer -- the short answer to all these questions is , " Yes . "
Yes , I 'm afraid of all of that .
I 've always had fear .
And I 'm afraid of many other things that people don 't have to be <unk> .
Like the <unk> and other things <unk> .
But , as I 'm going to write it about what I thought and I 'm <unk> <unk> is why ?
Is it <unk> ?
It 's <unk> that anyone who <unk> <unk> <unk> to be <unk> by a job that you could be born .
But what is that , so particular in the <unk> <unk> to <unk> about health <unk> <unk> in a way that other <unk> don 't do ?
Like my father , for example , he was a <unk> <unk> and I didn 't remember once in the 40 years of activity where he was asked if she was afraid to be <unk> <unk> ?
It 's never -- that <unk> of the <unk> John , how does that ?
<unk> 't you like that , <unk> ?
<unk> , the engineers <unk> as a group of course , in <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
We have enough , we have this <unk> , and not only <unk> but <unk> <unk> of all that , we have this <unk> to be <unk> <unk> .
And you don 't want to look at the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> that , only in the <unk> century , <unk> young and often for them .
And the ones that don 't have <unk> seem to be really <unk> by their <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , before I die , in the last <unk> said , " Every my book has <unk> me a little more <unk> , " <unk> my <unk> . " <unk> my <unk> . " <unk> my book .
But we don 't know when you say , because we 've heard these things so long that somehow we have completely <unk> and <unk> the <unk> that creativity and <unk> the <unk> of creativity and <unk> to be kind of <unk> and that art , at the end , we always get to <unk> .
And the question I want to <unk> you to all this today is : you agree with this idea ?
So , OK , this thing -- because I also <unk> by a <unk> <unk> <unk> to me . It 's not good for anything this <unk> .
I think it 's <unk> .
And I think it 's <unk> , and I don 't want to <unk> <unk> in the next century .
I think it 's better <unk> our big <unk> to live .
And I certainly know , in my case -- in my situation -- it would be very <unk> to start to that <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> in which I 'm in my career .
<unk> -- look at it , I 'm quite young , I have about 40 years .
I still have about four <unk> <unk> in me .
And it 's very <unk> that anything <unk> of the time in the world as the work that <unk> after I <unk> the world , and then I <unk> the last book .
<unk> <unk> , because we 're all about <unk> , because we 're all here -- is <unk> that my greatest success is to my <unk> .
Oh , <unk> , <unk> , thinking !
You know , this is the kind of thought that leads a person to start to start <unk> <unk> at the nine of the morning , and I don 't want to do it .
I could keep on doing this work that I love .
So , the question becomes , how ?
And so I think , after many <unk> , that the way to work to continue to write is to keep going to write is to create a <unk> <unk> <unk> , OK ?
I have to get a <unk> distance of security between me , which I 'm <unk> , and my <unk> <unk> on what the <unk> <unk> would be . And as I was <unk> for the last year models to do . And as I was trying to find other society , to find other <unk> . And as I 'm going to get better , and you can see if you have better ideas and more <unk> .
about how to help people <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of creativity .
And that research has brought to the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
It 's because you go back to <unk> and then <unk> back .
You have to <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> -- people don 't believe that creativity is <unk> by men , OK ?
It was <unk> that creativity was this <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> to men from some <unk> <unk> and <unk> , for reasons and <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> these <unk> <unk> of creativity <unk> .
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> to have a <unk> that <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> were the same idea , but they <unk> that kind of spirit without a <unk> .
The <unk> is <unk> , because <unk> don 't really believe that a <unk> was kind of smart .
And we thought that a <unk> was this kind of <unk> <unk> that actually <unk> <unk> in the study of a artist , a little artist , kind of like the <unk> <unk> , and I <unk> out of <unk> the work of the artist and <unk> the work of that .
<unk> <unk> <unk> , here is the distance of which I talk about -- that <unk> <unk> you <unk> on your <unk> .
And everyone thought it was how you <unk> , right ?
So the artists were <unk> by <unk> things , like the too <unk> , don 't ?
If your work was <unk> , you don 't have to <unk> all the <unk> , everybody <unk> you had been <unk> by this <unk> <unk> .
If your work <unk> , it wasn 't all your <unk> , right ?
Everybody <unk> you had to be a <unk> .
And so people <unk> <unk> creativity is in <unk> for a long time .
And then the <unk> <unk> and all <unk> , and we <unk> this great idea ; we put the human center of the universe and the center and the <unk> and the <unk> and no longer <unk> space to <unk> <unk> from <unk> .
This was the principle of <unk> <unk> and people started thinking about creativity being <unk> completely from <unk> .
And for the first time in history , you start to <unk> this or that artist as a <unk> <unk> than a person with <unk> .
And I have to tell you , I think it was a big <unk> .
I think you 're going to get to believe that , a <unk> person to believe that it 's like a source , <unk> and <unk> , <unk> and <unk> and <unk> is a responsibility for human <unk> .
It 's like <unk> to somebody to <unk> the sun .
<unk> and <unk> completely <unk> the <unk> and creates all these <unk> <unk> on the <unk> .
And I think it 's been this pressure to have <unk> artists in the <unk> 500 years .
And if this is true , and I think that 's the question , it gets , and now ?
Can we do it ?
<unk> go back to a more <unk> understanding of the relationship between humans and <unk> <unk> .
Or maybe it 's not .
Maybe we can 't <unk> 500 years of thinking in a <unk> talk .
And there 's probably people in the audience who <unk> <unk> <unk> on the <unk> of , <unk> , you do <unk> , you do <unk> people <unk> on their projects .
You probably don 't tell you all this thing .
But the question I want to tell you is -- why not ?
Why don 't you that way ?
Because it has more than any other thing I 've ever heard to explain the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> process .
A process of a process that , as anyone who ever <unk> to do something -- so , basically , you know , you don 't <unk> <unk> .
And , in fact , it can be completely <unk> .
I did this <unk> <unk> with the extraordinary <unk> <unk> <unk> , who has now 90 years , but it was a <unk> for all life and said to me that during his <unk> <unk> , <unk> out in the fields , and we <unk> it out in the fields , and we <unk> it , in the <unk> , in the <unk> <unk> .
He said , it was like a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And she <unk> <unk> to her from <unk> .
I <unk> it , because he did <unk> the land under its feet .
I decided to have one thing to do at that point and words , " <unk> as a <unk> . "
And then they went to the house and it was <unk> by this <unk> , and it wouldn 't have to get another one of paper and a <unk> enough <unk> , and a <unk> enough <unk> , and <unk> on the page .
Sometimes you don 't start to be fast enough , so I <unk> and <unk> and <unk> without able to get to the house and she <unk> it through the <unk> and she would <unk> <unk> through the <unk> , looking for , and she would <unk> it through the <unk> , looking for , and she would be a <unk> . "
Then there were that times -- this piece of the time , there were times when the was almost <unk> , right ?
So , he was <unk> at home , and he was looking for the paper and the <unk> <unk> through , and I was going to <unk> it , and then he said , he was like , and then he was like if he <unk> with the other hand and <unk> it .
I <unk> the tail and the <unk> in his body and the <unk> on the page .
And in these cases , the <unk> would be <unk> on the <unk> page , but <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> to the first word .
So when you <unk> it -- it 's <unk> , it 's <unk> , it 's exactly <unk> to my <unk> process .
Not my <unk> process -- I 'm not a <unk> .
I 'm a <unk> , and my way of <unk> is ; I <unk> at the same <unk> every day and work and <unk> on the <unk> .
But even me in my <unk> , I <unk> against that .
And I 'm sure that many of you <unk> that you would do it .
You know , even if the work and ideas I <unk> to <unk> it from a certain source , I could not <unk> <unk> .
And what is this thing ?
And how can we <unk> it in a way we don 't have to <unk> your head , but rather , that <unk> to do you <unk> ?
So , as I 'm <unk> , I <unk> <unk> <unk> , which I 've been <unk> <unk> , which I 've been <unk> several years ago for a <unk> .
And I was talking about this , and you know , <unk> , for the <unk> of life was the <unk> artist <unk> , trying to control , <unk> , <unk> these <unk> <unk> <unk> .
But then <unk> , he was <unk> , and a day he was <unk> on a <unk> <unk> , he was <unk> on a <unk> <unk> , he was <unk> all for him .
I 'm going fast fast and all of a <unk> <unk> , and it 's going to be in his head like <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , and the <unk> , you know , it 's wonderful , and the <unk> , but not how to <unk> it .
It 's not a piece of paper , it doesn 't have a <unk> .
So he starts to feel this kind of old <unk> that you could grow in him , and I 'm going to lose , and I 'm going to <unk> <unk> by this song .
I 'm not <unk> enough , and I can 't <unk> . "
And instead of going to <unk> , they <unk> .
<unk> the whole process of <unk> and did something completely new .
You just go to the sky and said , " <unk> , you don 't see I 'm <unk> ? "
" It seems to tell you a song now ?
If you really want to <unk> , you 're going to get a more <unk> when I can <unk> care of you .
<unk> , I started to <unk> another one of the <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . "
And the <unk> process after this .
Not the work , the work was still <unk> as always .
But the process , and the <unk> <unk> that had been <unk> when the <unk> , the <unk> that <unk> was out of him , he was <unk> that out of him , he had to be a <unk> , <unk> that had to be a <unk> and <unk> .
but I <unk> this <unk> , wonderful , <unk> <unk> a conversation between <unk> and this <unk> thing , and <unk> , but it wasn 't <unk> .
So , how much I <unk> that story is to change a little bit , the way I <unk> and already <unk> me once .
This idea , I <unk> when I was <unk> , " <unk> , <unk> , " and I <unk> in one of the <unk> of the <unk> where we 're working on something , and we don 't start thinking about it , it 's going to be a <unk> , that 's going to be a <unk> , that 's the book , that 's the book , that 's going to be the book .
Not only <unk> , just the book wrote .
And we start thinking about <unk> this project .
But then I 'm going to <unk> that I 'm going to go to the air and I <unk> .
So I <unk> my face on the <unk> and <unk> my <unk> to a <unk> <unk> <unk> in the room .
And I said to <unk> <unk> , " <unk> , what , both of know if this book is not going to be <unk> my , right ?
Because as you see I 'm <unk> everything I have , I have no more than this .
So if you want it to be better , you have to do your side .
OK . But if you don 't do it , you know what , I don 't .
I started writing the same because it 's my work .
And I want to do that , I 'm <unk> to do my part . " Because at the end , this is , OK -- <unk> does it in the <unk> of the North Africa , people <unk> to <unk> the <unk> . And the end of the moon , music <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> it <unk> on for hours to <unk> .
And they were always <unk> , because the <unk> were <unk> and were <unk> .
But every so much , I <unk> , something that is , and one of these <unk> artists actually <unk> in fact .
And I know what I 'm talking about , because I know you 've got it , at a point , a <unk> like this .
It was like the time , and the <unk> <unk> <unk> through a kind of <unk> , and it wasn 't doing anything different from <unk> usually , like <unk> <unk> first , but it was all <unk> .
And suddenly , you don 't just like a human .
But they <unk> out of the <unk> and <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk> .
And when this <unk> , at the time , people <unk> what was , I <unk> with his name .
<unk> your hands and I started to <unk> , " <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , God , " God . "
That 's God , you know .
You have to see <unk> -- when the <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> this <unk> with them and the <unk> <unk> in the <unk> , " <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , which you can still hear in <unk> or in <unk> .
In <unk> , when a artist did something impossible and <unk> , " <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> -- a <unk> of God .
And it 's <unk> because we need it .
But , the problem comes after day , to the <unk> itself , when you <unk> and <unk> 11 <unk> of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> . <unk> <unk> is no more .
It 's just a <unk> with a big <unk> to <unk> , and maybe you never <unk> to that <unk> .
And maybe nobody <unk> the name of God still while I 'm <unk> , and what it has to do with the rest of his life ?
It 's hard .
This is one of the most <unk> to do in a <unk> life .
But maybe it 's not to be so <unk> if you don 't believe , you don 't believe , <unk> , that the most <unk> of your being being you .
But let me just tell you that you get data in <unk> from a <unk> source of this <unk> part of your life that you then have to go to <unk> when you finished .
And , you know , if we think it all .
And so I started <unk> , and it 's certainly like I 've <unk> for several months during the <unk> of the book that I was <unk> , the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> of my success .
And what I have to continue to <unk> when I feel <unk> from this is , I don 't fear .
You don 't <unk> . You just have your work .
<unk> <unk> for your hand , whatever it can be .
If your work is <unk> , you get <unk> .
If you <unk> , you 'll <unk> <unk> to you <unk> <unk> <unk> some kind of <unk> , for a only moment through your <unk> , then you go to <unk> it .
<unk> , you do the same your <unk> .
And " <unk> ! " <unk> ! " <unk> . "
I think it 's <unk> . I think it 's <unk> .
" <unk> ! " <unk> ! " <unk> , " <unk> , " <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . "
Thank you .
Thank you .
<unk> : <unk> !
As you know I talked about some of these projects on the human genome , what it can <unk> and the discovery of new genes .
Now we 're going to <unk> a new way . We started <unk> the biology and now starting to <unk> the biology and now starting to <unk> the digital <unk> , and <unk> life .
We always tried to ask big questions .
" What is life ? " is something that many <unk> , I think have <unk> to understand at various levels .
We have different <unk> , we tried to <unk> terms .
We 're <unk> for about 20 years .
When we <unk> the human genome <unk> to go to <unk> from the world of the computer <unk> of biology in the world .
Now we can <unk> life , or create new life , or create new life of this digital universe ?
This is a map of a little <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> , which is the species from the <unk> genome that can <unk> in the lab .
And we tried to reduce the genome to <unk> a little bit more small .
We can <unk> a <unk> of genes about 500 than 500 than 500 genes are here .
But when you look at his <unk> map , it 's <unk> simple than our own .
<unk> , this is simple .
But when we look at all the genes that we can <unk> , one at the time , is very <unk> that this can bring to a <unk> cell .
So I thought the only way to <unk> was <unk> this <unk> so that they <unk> <unk> to <unk> some of these questions .
And so we started the <unk> of " Can we <unk> a <unk> ? "
Can the chemistry <unk> of these big molecules that we never have never been able to create before we 've never been able to create before ?
And , in case , you can we make a <unk> ?
A <unk> is just a piece of <unk> material .
The speed with which we 're able to <unk> life is <unk> to <unk> <unk> .
Our ability to write the code , instead of <unk> , but it 's <unk> .
And our <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> .
We 've been <unk> over 15 years ago .
The process has <unk> a lot of <unk> , <unk> with a <unk> <unk> before we <unk> experiments .
But we found that DNA <unk> is very difficult .
There are <unk> of thousands of cars in the world that <unk> little <unk> of DNA , of 30 to 50 <unk> and it 's a process . It 's a <unk> process : the <unk> is the long , the <unk> is <unk> , the <unk> is <unk> .
So we had to develop a new way to <unk> these <unk> and <unk> the <unk> .
And this was our first <unk> , <unk> <unk> of <unk> genome .
It 's a little virus that bacteria <unk> .
We designed <unk> , <unk> the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> a DNA <unk> of DNA .
The interesting part is when we have a piece of <unk> <unk> material , and we <unk> it in bacteria , bacteria have <unk> to read this code , and <unk> the <unk> particles .
The <unk> particles have been <unk> by the cells , they 're <unk> back and they <unk> the <unk> <unk> .
I talked about recently with members of the <unk> <unk> <unk> that they have certainly <unk> this model .
They have more than you .
And we think this is a situation where the software can actually build the same <unk> in a <unk> system .
But we want to do the greatest .
We had to build the whole <unk> of <unk> .
They 're more than <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> code .
So we thought we 're going to <unk> the size of the virus , so we can change the <unk> to understand what the <unk> of a <unk> cell .
The <unk> is <unk> , and if you <unk> information <unk> in a computer , these must be very <unk> .
When I <unk> this genome for the first time in <unk> the standard <unk> was a <unk> for every 10 <unk> <unk> .
We found , <unk> , 30 <unk> . If you could use that original <unk> <unk> , you would never be able to do it work .
A process of the process is to design <unk> 50 <unk> that <unk> with all other <unk> <unk> to build smaller than <unk> together .
It 's going to be <unk> here .
You probably read that it <unk> us to <unk> .
So we have a <unk> code on four <unk> : A , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk>
<unk> of those <unk> <unk> together , about 20 <unk> , and there 's a <unk> order to <unk> every <unk> .
So we can use the code for the words , <unk> , <unk> .
What we did we do is in the beginning was <unk> .
Some people have been <unk> by the fact that it wasn 't <unk> .
We designed these <unk> to just <unk> <unk> with <unk> .
There are <unk> that <unk> them and <unk> <unk> them .
And we started <unk> with <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> to them all the way to get to <unk> <unk> <unk> .
So , at every step , we produced these <unk> so that we 're <unk> to <unk> , because we 're trying to create a extremely <unk> <unk> as you 'll see in a minute .
We 're trying to <unk> the process .
So , this seems to be a <unk> <unk> .
When you get to these <unk> , we get a lot of <unk> <unk> , you don 't get to directly to the <unk> <unk> .
You get to the <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> biology .
So we have other <unk> .
<unk> of another <unk> called <unk> <unk> , which in biology <unk> to <unk> the DNA .
Here is an example .
This <unk> , called <unk> <unk> , can <unk> three million <unk> <unk> .
You can see in the <unk> <unk> as his <unk> is <unk> .
<unk> 12 hours is <unk> exactly as the first was before .
<unk> thousands of organisms that are able to do that .
These organisms can completely <unk> .
You have to live under <unk> .
I 'm absolutely sure that life <unk> in space , and <unk> to find new <unk> of water .
Actually , NASA <unk> showed that this happens .
This is a picture of the <unk> that we 've built these <unk> , just by just using the <unk> with design <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> <unk> .
This was not <unk> with a <unk> <unk> , but with a <unk> <unk> .
It 's such a big <unk> that we can <unk> with a <unk> <unk> .
These are pictures that <unk> a period of about six seconds .
This is the <unk> we did a little time ago .
They 're more than <unk> <unk> code .
It 's the largest <unk> of a <unk> structure that ever <unk> by man .
It 's got <unk> <unk> to 300 million .
If you <unk> it with a <unk> 10 <unk> without spaces , you 'll have only <unk> pages to <unk> this code .
Now , how do we make it work ? How can we <unk> it ?
<unk> , with a virus is a game game .
It 's a little bit more <unk> when you use of the bacteria .
It 's more simple when it comes to the <unk> cells like our : you can just <unk> the <unk> and <unk> another , which is that basically the <unk> of <unk> .
In <unk> <unk> , the <unk> is instead of <unk> , but we have <unk> <unk> that we are able to make a <unk> <unk> of a cell to another cell <unk> to another cell <unk> .
We <unk> a <unk> <unk> by a kind of <unk> .
The two are different than men from <unk> .
We <unk> some <unk> in a way that we could decide which to choose to choose which is to choose to <unk> .
And then he <unk> with the <unk> so that they <unk> all the <unk> .
And when we put it in the cell was <unk> and <unk> our <unk> <unk> the new <unk> went into the <unk> .
And we had to <unk> that we don 't want to go beyond , but we tried to <unk> more in there .
This is one of the major <unk> of evolution .
We found that <unk> species have <unk> a second or a third <unk> that , <unk> in a second thousand <unk> to that species .
So who think about evolution as a only <unk> at the time you 've got no way of biology .
We have <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> that was in the cell didn 't <unk> one .
The <unk> <unk> we have <unk> it .
It 's <unk> , and it has <unk> the other <unk> as a <unk> material , he <unk> it , and we 've <unk> with just the cell and the new <unk> .
has become blue because of the genes we have <unk> .
And in a short <unk> of time , all the <unk> of time , all the <unk> of the <unk> of all in a new kind of <unk> , <unk> on the new software that we have <unk> in the cell .
All the <unk> are <unk> , the <unk> are <unk> , and when you <unk> the code that we <unk> at exactly what we 've <unk> .
Now , this may be <unk> <unk> , but we can <unk> the DNA , we can change things in a <unk> way .
Now , I 've already <unk> that this is not about <unk> -- but of progress , from three million years and a half years , and I said that maybe we 're going to create a new version of the <unk> <unk> where we <unk> new species <unk> on this process .
Why do that ?
I think it 's pretty <unk> when we think of our <unk> .
We 're going to go to six billion and a half billion people in the next 40 years .
Right , to give you an example : I was born in <unk> .
Now there are three people on the planet to <unk> <unk> in <unk> ; there 's four .
We 're <unk> problems now , we 're <unk> and <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
We 're even more <unk> to do it for nine billion .
<unk> over five billion <unk> , over 30 billion <unk> ,
That means 100 million <unk> a day .
When we try to find <unk> <unk> , or any kind of process to <unk> , it 's going to be a huge challenge .
In more we have to realize that all of CO2 <unk> from these materials that <unk> in the atmosphere .
So , we have a <unk> with <unk> <unk> all over the world , we have a <unk> with about 20 million genes , and I like to think that are the <unk> <unk> for the future .
The <unk> industry only a <unk> of <unk> , and think about how many different things are <unk> out .
Our <unk> here are <unk> data from the <unk> reality and our imagination .
Now we have <unk> , thank you to these <unk> <unk> <unk> , able to create what we call <unk> <unk> .
We can make a big robot that can produce a million <unk> a day .
Think of <unk> these 20 million genes or <unk> to try to <unk> the <unk> to produce <unk> or <unk> , new <unk> , we can change , because of a little team , and create more <unk> biology now that in the last 20 years of science .
And it 's just a standard <unk> .
We can choose to choose <unk> , <unk> <unk> , chemistry or <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
This is a <unk> of some software <unk> that we 're working on to be able to <unk> and design species on the computer .
Well , we don 't know how they 're going to be .
We know exactly how the <unk> is the <unk> of their <unk> .
We 're going to <unk> on the <unk> <unk> .
You 've seen that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> was a <unk> experiment .
We have <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> that we 're going to soon from <unk> to <unk> <unk> as the <unk> <unk> or different kinds of <unk> .
But the only way that biology can have a big impact without <unk> the cost of food and <unk> <unk> <unk> would be <unk> CO2 , and we 're working on to design cells that we 're working on to design cells that can reach this , and we think we can have the first <unk> <unk> in about 18 months .
<unk> <unk> <unk> with CO2 is a <unk> , but in our <unk> <unk> around the world , we found different <unk> .
This is a <unk> we have <unk> in <unk> .
It <unk> in the ocean deep , at about <unk> feet of <unk> water .
We 're <unk> by CO2 using hydrogen <unk> as hydrogen <unk> as hydrogen .
We 're trying to understand whether we can <unk> CO2 , which can easily be <unk> by <unk> , <unk> that we can easily be <unk> through <unk> , <unk> that CO2 in <unk> , to drive this process .
So , I think I can be able to <unk> what the basic question of what the basic question is that we , we have the <unk> goal to <unk> the whole industry .
<unk> . If you can 't do this from TED , where can you ?
It 's a main source of energy .
And we 're working for using the same <unk> to use the same <unk> to create <unk> <unk> .
You 've seen this year with the flu , we 're always <unk> back a year and with a dollar in less when it 's about finding the right .
I think what you can change is <unk> <unk> in <unk> .
So , this is how the future could start looking for , now , the tree , <unk> evolution with bacteria bacteria , <unk> , and then <unk> cells .
We 're in so much , we 're in the <unk> .
Our purpose is to make a long enough to try to make a <unk> <unk> . Thank you very much .
So , first of all I 'm going to do , the <unk> possible , some fundamental work , a new technology that we 've got to <unk> <unk> at <unk> <unk> a year ago .
This is a environment that you can <unk> is <unk> with a huge amount of <unk> data .
Here we 're seeing <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> with a kind of <unk> <unk> and <unk> , for a fast <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> the images as we want .
And it doesn 't matter how big it is the amount of information that we see , how big it is this <unk> of data or data .
Most of them are common photographs , but this for example is a <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> in the <unk> of <unk> , and <unk> in the <unk> of 300 <unk> .
It 's not a difference because the only thing you <unk> the <unk> of a system like this is the number of <unk> on your screen at any time . It 's also a very <unk> architecture .
This is a book , example of data , not images .
This is the <unk> <unk> <unk> . Every <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And to say that , this is just a <unk> , and not of images , we can do something like that , to actually get really <unk> about the text <unk> , not a picture .
It could be a kind of <unk> to read a book .
I don 't <unk> it .
This is an example more <unk> . This is a number of <unk> .
Every image is the beginning of a <unk> .
And it really gives you the pleasure and the experience of reading the true version of a <unk> or a <unk> , which is for nature a <unk> , which is for nature a <unk> .
We also did something with the corner of this number in particular <unk> .
We created a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> than what you use in a normal <unk> , and we have <unk> content of the <unk> content .
If you want to see the <unk> of this <unk> , you can see here .
Or other models , or even <unk> <unk> .
And this really <unk> some of these ideas to <unk> the <unk> of space on the screen .
We want to put it to put the <unk> to <unk> and other <unk> similar <unk> , not to be <unk> .
Of course , the <unk> is one of the most <unk> <unk> for this kind of technology .
And on this , I don 't want to lose time , if not to say that we have <unk> to give it to this field .
These are all the streets on the <unk> on a NASA picture of the NASA <unk> .
So now I 'm going to start with something else .
This is actually actually live on the Web ; you can see it .
This is a project called <unk> , which <unk> two different technologies .
One is <unk> and the other is a <unk> research that was very interesting to the computer computer <unk> , a <unk> student of Washington , with the help of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> . <unk> <unk> . <unk> <unk> .
And it 's alive on the Web , <unk> .
You can <unk> when we do this kind of <unk> , where we can go from a picture to the other and have this kind of experience in <unk> <unk> .
But the <unk> <unk> of the images here actually have a meaning .
The <unk> <unk> of the computer <unk> have <unk> these images , so that they <unk> the places that <unk> <unk> all over to the <unk> <unk> <unk> have been <unk> . And so you see the elements of a <unk> <unk> , and these things were all <unk> at the <unk> level .
I don 't know if I have a time to show you some other environment .
There are a lot more <unk> .
I want to get directly to one of the <unk> of <unk> data , and this <unk> by a <unk> <unk> that we did work for the first time , we <unk> this technology , the <unk> technology , <unk> . It 's not <unk> by looking for the <unk> that we have in the website .
We had to <unk> some <unk> and so on .
This is a <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> images of types of <unk> , <unk> <unk> , other <unk> of the <unk> and <unk> and <unk> . And he <unk> of these <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
So they 're all <unk> images from <unk> and they were all <unk> at the <unk> level like this .
And you can <unk> this <unk> way .
You know , I never thought of end up working for <unk> .
It 's very <unk> to be <unk> , you know , you know , this kind of <unk> here .
I think we want to see that this is a lot of different types of <unk> : from the cell to those <unk> <unk> , a <unk> number , <unk> with this environment .
And if I can , I can , I go and I 'll try and <unk> it .
Many are <unk> by <unk> , etc .
<unk> here is a series of photographs -- <unk> .
This is a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
We can go from the <unk> to <unk> physics of this environment .
The point is that we can do things with social environment . This is now <unk> data from the whole memory of how to <unk> the earth , from the <unk> point of view and <unk> all that data together .
All of those pictures become <unk> together , and the <unk> of the <unk> parts .
You have a model of the whole thing that <unk> .
Think about this as the <unk> of the work of <unk> <unk> on Earth .
It 's something that you <unk> in <unk> complexity as people <unk> , and the <unk> that you 're going to <unk> it with the use .
Their pictures are <unk> with <unk> by other people .
If somebody comes to <unk> 's idea of <unk> all these <unk> <unk> <unk> , my picture of <unk> <unk> <unk> , you know , I can use it as a <unk> <unk> to <unk> in that space , in that <unk> , in that <unk> , using pictures of anyone , and having a social experience <unk> and <unk> .
Of course , a <unk> of all this is <unk> models of every interesting part of the land , <unk> not just by <unk> <unk> and <unk> images , but that 's memory <unk> .
Thank you .
Chris Anderson : I understand ? What 's your software ? What your software your whole world is that at some point , in the next few years , all the photographs that we 're going to be <unk> together ?
<unk> : Yes . What 's doing is basically , it 's <unk> .
He 's creating <unk> , if you want , between images .
And it 's <unk> it 's <unk> .
The thing becomes very interesting if you think about the <unk> of information that many of these <unk> images .
Like a <unk> , you do a <unk> <unk> and the text on the page , you <unk> a <unk> , and the text on the page has a lot of information about images .
Now , what happens if that picture is going on to all your pictures ?
So the amount of <unk> <unk> and the amount of <unk> that you have a lot of <unk> . It 's a <unk> effect .
CA : <unk> , it 's really incredible . <unk> .
<unk> : I 'm going to tell you a lot .
One of the main <unk> when you <unk> and one of the <unk> of the <unk> research is to live in the wind , and the <unk> <unk> <unk> , between who <unk> the past the wind , the wind <unk> <unk> , <unk> the <unk> <unk> of plants .
You think that <unk> <unk> <unk> still <unk> beyond the <unk> <unk> , or that the <unk> of <unk> are still <unk> of <unk> , or that <unk> , the <unk> <unk> still the <unk> of the <unk> , to remember the <unk> of the <unk> , and that the idea that the world in which we live in in a sense , but it 's only a model of reality , but it 's just a model of reality ,
the <unk> of a particular <unk> of <unk> choices that our <unk> has done , or evil , many <unk> ago .
And , of course , all <unk> <unk> of <unk> .
Everybody <unk> . Everybody <unk> .
We 're <unk> to <unk> .
We have to deal with the <unk> of death , so we don 't <unk> it and <unk> --
We all have a art .
What <unk> is the <unk> of the song , the <unk> of every culture .
It doesn 't matter that matter the <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> , or the <unk> of <unk> <unk> , or the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , or the <unk> of <unk> , or a <unk> in the heart of the <unk> .
He was my <unk> of journey in <unk> a month ago , or a <unk> <unk> of <unk> in the <unk> , on the <unk> , on the <unk> , the <unk> mother of the world .
All of these <unk> <unk> that there are other ways of <unk> other ways of thinking , other ways of moving around the world .
And if you look a moment , it 's a concept that can give you hope .
<unk> , the <unk> of the world create a <unk> of <unk> life and <unk> that <unk> the planet , and it 's important for the planet 's <unk> as the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And you can think of this <unk> <unk> as a <unk> and you can <unk> the <unk> of all the <unk> , dreams , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> in being by the human imagination .
<unk> is the great <unk> of humanity .
It 's the <unk> of what we 're and what we can be as as <unk> species .
And <unk> <unk> was <unk> <unk> <unk> has been <unk> to <unk> and <unk> much <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , for example , <unk> that 50 percent of all the species has been or is about the <unk> of the <unk> of diversity -- and you don 't even even <unk> at the <unk> -- in the <unk> of diversity -- and you don 't even even <unk> at the <unk> <unk> -- that 's <unk> diversity .
The <unk> of this is , of course , the <unk> <unk> .
When you 're <unk> <unk> <unk> on this planet .
A language is not only <unk> by a <unk> or a series of rules .
A language is the <unk> of the human spirit .
It 's the middle that the <unk> of every culture comes in the world .
Every language is a forest of the mind , a <unk> , a thought , a <unk> of possibility .
And of those <unk> <unk> , as we 're sitting here at least , at least half is no longer <unk> in the <unk> of the children .
They 're not going to be <unk> to children , which means , unless you have something , they 're already death .
What is more <unk> than being <unk> by the <unk> , of being the last to speak a language , not <unk> to <unk> the <unk> of <unk> or to <unk> the <unk> of <unk> or <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> or to <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> or to <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> , or to <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk>
This <unk> <unk> was the state of somebody in the world every two weeks : every two weeks , a <unk> <unk> and brings with <unk> <unk> .
And I know some of you say , " Well , " <unk> 't that . " Is that that ?
The world wouldn 't be a better place if we all the same language ? " <unk> , then we all <unk> . <unk> . <unk> .
<unk> <unk> .
<unk> of a <unk> thing that means you can 't talk about your language .
I 'd like to give you a journey to make a journey through the <unk> --
a little journey in the <unk> to give you a <unk> of what we 're <unk> .
Many of us <unk> that when I say " different ways of <unk> . " I mean , " I really have different ways of <unk> .
So , for example , this <unk> <unk> , in <unk> <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> , which <unk> at the <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
It 's a <unk> that 's not able to <unk> the blue color because the green is <unk> in the forest , because the time <unk> is <unk> in the forest , which we <unk> the <unk> .
They have a <unk> language and a <unk> rule , " <unk> <unk> . " <unk> <unk> . " <unk> <unk> . " <unk> a person talking a different language .
All of this has <unk> in the past <unk> , the <unk> is that in these <unk> families where they talk six or seven <unk> because of <unk> <unk> <unk> nobody 's <unk> .
You start listening and then they start to talk to .
I had one of the most interesting <unk> that I lived , the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , an incredible <unk> that had the first <unk> in <unk> .
In <unk> five <unk> <unk> have <unk> contact a <unk> <unk> .
They did <unk> <unk> by the top photographs that <unk> them in <unk> <unk> , <unk> that this <unk> of <unk> forest had never seen anything .
They <unk> the <unk> , they <unk> the <unk> to the <unk> of a form or a <unk> , and they didn 't know anything , they have <unk> that <unk> <unk> , and they <unk> the five <unk> with the <unk> .
But <unk> not only <unk> .
They <unk> them .
<unk> percent of the <unk> <unk> was <unk> by themselves .
We were <unk> to eight <unk> and we found two <unk> of death , and when we <unk> to know , they <unk> that one of them was <unk> so that he died , and then they <unk> the same . [ <unk> ] <unk> , so they had an incredible <unk> of the forest .
The <unk> were able to recognize the animal <unk> <unk> and <unk> the species .
In the early ' <unk> , I was a really interesting job when my <unk> <unk> <unk> me if I wanted to go to <unk> <unk> in <unk> society , at the base of the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> , and <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> .
To give a sense of the <unk> , I should understand culture <unk> , and that <unk> is not <unk> .
It 's quite a <unk> <unk> vision of the world .
Very interesting .
If you tell you to <unk> the big <unk> of the world , what would you like to me ?
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , etc .
A continent comes out , thinking , <unk> <unk> <unk> , and instead , and the <unk> is not another one that the <unk> of these <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
What makes the <unk> is the <unk> of life between life and death .
So <unk> do <unk> <unk> .
<unk> can be <unk> by the <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> live in such a <unk> that for a moment a <unk> becomes the <unk> .
So , the <unk> <unk> to say , " <unk> go to <unk> to talk about God .
We <unk> in <unk> and <unk> God . "
And when you 're <unk> , is the spirit that <unk> you can get <unk> , how can you get <unk> ?
So , you start to these incredible events : <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a rather strong <unk> of the power of mind , when it 's <unk> in a state of <unk> <unk> .
I <unk> all the <unk> that I lived with the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> , in the <unk> <unk> <unk> , in the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> of the <unk> civilization <unk> that once <unk> on the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> in the <unk> , the <unk> <unk> on the <unk> <unk> .
In a <unk> continent , <unk> , this <unk> has never been <unk> by <unk> .
<unk> <unk> today are <unk> by a <unk> , but their <unk> is extraordinary .
The young <unk> are <unk> by <unk> <unk> <unk> , and they live in a world <unk> , <unk> in a world <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> for 18 years .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
For that time , they 're <unk> to the values of their society , values that <unk> that their <unk> and only <unk> <unk> <unk> -- or to say the <unk> <unk> .
And then the <unk> of this incredible <unk> , they 're <unk> out and for the first time in their life , at the age of 18 , see an <unk> . And in that moment of the first <unk> , when the sun <unk> <unk> , when the sun <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , all we have been <unk> in the <unk> . <unk> does a <unk> <unk> , and says ,
" <unk> ? I 'm going to tell you how I said .
It 's <unk> . Now it 's <unk> . "
They call <unk> <unk> , and they say that we , <unk> <unk> , we are the <unk> of the world .
This is an <unk> level of important .
When we think about <unk> <unk> and the <unk> <unk> environment , and the old history of <unk> <unk> , which is a concept in its <unk> or maybe <unk> <unk> and say that these <unk> are closer to the Earth .
The <unk> <unk> are not <unk> or <unk> by <unk> .
There is no room for these things in the <unk> <unk> of <unk> or in the <unk> <unk> , but <unk> at time and <unk> , they created a <unk> of the Earth , they created a <unk> of the Earth , they can only live because it 's <unk> by human consciousness .
What does that mean ?
You know , you know , a <unk> of the <unk> that <unk> the mountain is a <unk> spirit that <unk> its <unk> is going to be a human being <unk> different , and it 's got a <unk> different relationship with the mountain or the <unk> of <unk> that <unk> a mountain is a <unk> of <unk> to be <unk> .
which is a <unk> of a spirit or a <unk> <unk> is <unk> .
What 's interesting is the <unk> that <unk> the relationship between the <unk> and the natural world .
I grew up in the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> that the <unk> <unk> to be <unk> .
And that made me a human being different from my <unk> friends who believe that <unk> are the <unk> of <unk> and the <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> that live in the <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> that live in the <unk> <unk> .
If you start to <unk> that these <unk> can actually create different , we can actually start to understand some of them <unk> . We can do this <unk> .
I <unk> this picture to <unk> in the <unk> <unk> .
Maybe some of you have heard about <unk> , the most powerful <unk> of the <unk> <unk> .
What makes the <unk> is not the potential <unk> of the <unk> , but his <unk> . It 's <unk> by two elements .
On one hand , this <unk> <unk> <unk> a series of <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
<unk> the only <unk> has a <unk> <unk> that <unk> a little bit , the <unk> , but it 's <unk> with the <unk> 's family <unk> said <unk> .
This <unk> has <unk> <unk> , very similar to <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
If you ever see the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> that do a different <unk> , <unk> it <unk> .
<unk> that <unk> on the <unk> is a little bit like being <unk> by a <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> on a sea of electricity . [ <unk> ] [ <unk> ] [ <unk> ] ] [ <unk> ] . It 's actually <unk> .
I often <unk> with my <unk> , Richard <unk> <unk> , the man who <unk> the <unk> was <unk> , with his discovery of <unk> in the <unk> ' <unk> .
<unk> to my <unk> , you can 't be <unk> these <unk> as <unk> because if you can 't tell anybody . It 's <unk> . <unk> 't be <unk> because I 'm <unk> . <unk> 't be <unk> because I 'm <unk> by a <unk> that 's of course in <unk> , <unk> .
It 's possible to <unk> <unk> only if you <unk> with other <unk> <unk> that <unk> .
Now it 's the beautiful : the <unk> that are in this <unk> are <unk> , the same kind of necessary to <unk> the <unk> . The question <unk> <unk> : in a <unk> of <unk> species of plants , like these <unk> to <unk> two <unk> don 't similar , but what if you <unk> this <unk> , they make a <unk> version of <unk> that 's <unk> at the <unk> of the <unk> of the parts ?
We use the big <unk> of the evidence and the <unk> , which can <unk> <unk> .
But if you go to the <unk> , we 'll be " The plants talk . "
What does that mean ?
This <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , who <unk> <unk> in the forest , and our eyes in the same species .
If you <unk> it as they <unk> their <unk> <unk> , " I 'm going to <unk> <unk> , you don 't know ? " I said , " " No . "
The solution is : you take the <unk> <unk> in a night night full and <unk> <unk> with a different <unk> .
And that 's not <unk> to <unk> , but it 's much more interesting than <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Now , [ <unk> ] the problem is that even those of us who have <unk> <unk> them , but in a way to the <unk> of history of history than our real , and <unk> <unk> .
In fact , the <unk> century , in the <unk> century , not <unk> <unk> for his <unk> or <unk> <unk> <unk> , but rather as the <unk> was where we <unk> and we <unk> <unk> or <unk> the mass <unk> of diversity and <unk> and <unk> on the planet . Now the problem is not the change .
All the <unk> through the <unk> have been <unk> in a <unk> for new possibilities .
And the problem is not technology .
<unk> <unk> don 't have <unk> to be <unk> when they put <unk> and <unk> as the <unk> have <unk> to be <unk> when they <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
It 's not the change or technology that <unk> the <unk> of <unk> . It 's power .
The <unk> <unk> of <unk> .
And if you look at the world , you 'll see that these are not <unk> <unk> to <unk> .
They 're <unk> creatures and <unk> <unk> out of the <unk> of <unk> forces that go beyond their <unk> capacity .
<unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> --
a <unk> <unk> <unk> , in <unk> <unk> , a <unk> that lived in the forest to a generation of a generation <unk> , and now <unk> to the <unk> <unk> , where you can see the <unk> <unk> from the <unk> , which <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , which <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , where the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , where the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , where the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> ,
We start to <unk> the <unk> with the <unk> <unk> to the forest .
Or , in the case of <unk> , are the diseases that are <unk> with the discovery of <unk> .
If you put it in the <unk> of the <unk> , where I 'm doing a lot of research , you 'll see the <unk> of politics .
As a <unk> <unk> , <unk> physics of a <unk> , is <unk> at the <unk> level , but <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the development of the <unk> , it 's not <unk> , but <unk> <unk> in certain <unk> , because it 's part of the development of the development .
And you can 't understand the <unk> of the <unk> until you start .
I <unk> the <unk> miles from <unk> in the Western <unk> , and I started <unk> with a young <unk> , but only came to <unk> , I realized what the <unk> behind .
They had to <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> million people <unk> from the <unk> during the <unk> <unk> .
The father of this boy was <unk> to the <unk> <unk> .
which means that it was <unk> at the time of the Chinese <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> who brought the <unk> in <unk> .
My mother was <unk> and his <unk> was <unk> .
It 's been brought to <unk> in <unk> at the age of two years of his <unk> , because he couldn 't have no .
The <unk> , who did the same , was <unk> in <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> , for this <unk> , was <unk> to the <unk> work for seven years .
The pain of <unk> can be <unk> , but the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> is <unk> by present .
<unk> , it all <unk> to a choice .
Do you have to live in the <unk> world or want to <unk> the world of diversity ?
The big <unk> <unk> <unk> , before he died said that his greatest fear was that , in our <unk> to go to this <unk> vision of the world 's imagination , not only <unk> the whole <unk> of human imagination to a <unk> of thought , but a day we were <unk> to <unk> <unk> that there were other possibilities .
And it 's <unk> to remember that our species is <unk> for <unk> years .
The <unk> <unk> , who gave us <unk> , which made us <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> , <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> , <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> , creating the <unk> of <unk> , <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> , and we talk about <unk> years ago .
The <unk> world has <unk> 300 years old .
That <unk> story , I don 't think we have the answers to all the challenges that we 're going to <unk> in <unk> .
When these <unk> <unk> of the world is asked what it means to be human , <unk> with <unk> <unk> different <unk> .
And it 's in these answers that we all have the chance of being what we are : a kind of <unk> , which has to <unk> , all the <unk> can <unk> . And there are big moments of <unk> .
I <unk> this picture on the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> island , when I went to <unk> <unk> with <unk> , and this man , <unk> , he <unk> the wonderful story of his <unk> .
The <unk> government wasn 't always <unk> with the <unk> <unk> and in the <unk> to <unk> our <unk> , we <unk> them in <unk> .
The <unk> of this man <unk> <unk> .
The family , <unk> for his life , the <unk> away all the <unk> , and all his <unk> .
You want to know that <unk> don 't <unk> , <unk> it .
The <unk> <unk> <unk> were made of fish <unk> in <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> of this man didn 't <unk> on night or <unk> .
It 's <unk> , it <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> in your hand . When I did it <unk> , he <unk> it , he <unk> it , he <unk> it , he <unk> it up with a <unk> .
He has <unk> <unk> on the <unk> of this <unk> <unk> , and when <unk> <unk> <unk> , he <unk> a dog .
He <unk> the dog created a <unk> , with the <unk> <unk> <unk> created a <unk> , has <unk> another dog , and it 's <unk> on the <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
What about <unk> ? <unk> [ <unk> ] . And this , in different ways , [ <unk> ] is the <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> <unk> and all the <unk> of the world 's <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> to <unk> control of a <unk> area of <unk> larger than California and <unk> <unk> together .
It 's their new <unk> . It 's called <unk> .
It 's a <unk> <unk> . It 's a <unk> <unk> .
One <unk> example of how a <unk> can <unk> with his <unk> .
And , finally , I think it 's quite <unk> at least who are in these <unk> areas of the planet , we realize that they 're not not at all .
For somebody is house .
<unk> <unk> of human imagination that <unk> to the <unk> of the time . And for all of us , the dreams of these kids , like the dreams of our children , become part of the <unk> of hope of the <unk> .
To end , we <unk> <unk> we are <unk> that <unk> never <unk> to anything .
I think <unk> --
[ <unk> ] are not <unk> , but we believe that stories can change the world , and maybe we are the best <unk> to tell the stories of the world . Every month our site is <unk> <unk> million <unk> .
<unk> <unk> our <unk> <unk> .
Our <unk> are <unk> by millions of people .
Our work is <unk> in <unk> to bring our public places in places of <unk> <unk> from which <unk> <unk> from which we <unk> <unk> as much as they saw and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , the <unk> of <unk> , the world of <unk> in diversity , and we have to find a <unk> <unk> <unk> in a <unk> world and <unk> .
where we <unk> all the <unk> can <unk> to our <unk> <unk> .
Thank you .
I 'm going to talk about some things that I wrote in this book that I hope to <unk> other you 've heard of and <unk> <unk> , in case , you don 't know .
I want to start with what I call the <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> of what ?
The <unk> <unk> of all the society <unk> . The <unk> <unk> <unk> : " If we want to <unk> the <unk> of our citizens . " The way to do it is to <unk> the freedom to do it . "
The reason is , on the side , in the fact that freedom is in itself , a value , is <unk> , <unk> for humans .
On the other one is that if we 're <unk> , we 're all about us to do this , we can do all of us to do this , without anybody who <unk> in our name .
The way to <unk> the freedom is to <unk> the choice .
More choices people have , the more <unk> , and more <unk> is their freedom , the higher one is their freedom ,
This , <unk> , it 's so <unk> <unk> in society that no one <unk> to <unk> .
And it 's also <unk> <unk> in our lives .
I 'm going to show you some examples of what progress has made it possible .
This is my <unk> . It 's not particularly big .
I <unk> a simple note on the <unk> to <unk> .
In my <unk> , there are <unk> <unk> , without <unk> the 10 <unk> of <unk> <unk> and the 12 <unk> <unk> you can buy for a huge number of <unk> in the <unk> that no one of the <unk> is that no one of the <unk> is your <unk> .
Here 's what the <unk> is .
And then you go to the <unk> store for <unk> : <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
And in this single <unk> store , there 's a big number of <unk> <unk> .
We can make six and a half million different <unk> <unk> that are in one .
You have to say there 's <unk> choice .
<unk> <unk> : The world of <unk> .
Once , when I was a child , you could get all the <unk> <unk> , in <unk> that were <unk> by <unk> <unk> .
You <unk> the phone , you don 't <unk> it .
A <unk> of that , between the other , was that the phone never <unk> .
These times they went .
We have now a <unk> <unk> of <unk> , especially between cell phones .
Here 's cell phones .
My <unk> is in the middle , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , and <unk> for <unk> <unk> .
If you don 't still have seen it in the store under the house , you 're very well ,
And what the end of the time is that people <unk> in the <unk> and does this question . And you know what the answer is , " " No . "
It 's not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn 't face <unk> .
So , in other <unk> of life that are much more important than <unk> , you get the same <unk> of choices .
<unk> <unk> : You don 't happen to the United States you 're going to be <unk> by <unk> and the <unk> you have to do .
Instead , you get to the <unk> , and the <unk> says , " OK , we can do . " And you can do it . " And he 's got these <unk> and these <unk> . What do you want to do ? "
You ask him , " <unk> , what to do you want to do ? "
And the <unk> says , " <unk> has these <unk> , and <unk> has these <unk> , and <unk> has these <unk> . "
" What do you want to do ? "
And you say , " You were saying , if you were me , what would you like ? "
And the <unk> : " But I 'm not her . "
The result we call it <unk> <unk> , <unk> that makes it look beautiful .
But it 's not a <unk> that <unk> the weight and the responsibility to make decisions that you know something , <unk> the <unk> , <unk> , to somebody who knows something , and almost certainly is <unk> -- and so that it 's almost certainly <unk> -- and so that you don 't have any -- and it 's actually , the patient .
There 's a huge <unk> of <unk> , <unk> to people like me and you , if you think about it doesn 't make sense , because we can 't <unk> it .
But if we can 't <unk> , why do we <unk> them ?
The answer is they want to <unk> we call the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> that 's so fundamental how our <unk> is now , a question of how do we see in this <unk> . " We don 't want to <unk> kids . <unk> their sex at the right time . " You don 't have a <unk> . " We have to <unk> it .
And we can <unk> how many times we <unk> .
That means that every <unk> , the <unk> , you have to decide that kind of person you want to be .
And then I went to the family and the <unk> , a <unk> perspective , almost to anyone , it was that you <unk> the <unk> as soon as possible .
The only real choice was who , not when , and not , not even what to do later .
<unk> , it 's really to play .
They 're going to be smart students , and they <unk> them the 20 percent in less work than a time .
And not because they 're not <unk> , not because they 're less <unk> .
but why am I <unk> , I started <unk> , I think , or not ? "
" <unk> <unk> <unk> later ? I have to think before the children or my career ? "
They 're <unk> <unk> .
And they try to answer these questions , even though this <unk> doesn 't <unk> the <unk> that <unk> and not get a beautiful <unk> to my <unk> .
And they have to do that . They 're important questions .
Now , the work : we 're <unk> , as a <unk> <unk> , because technology technology <unk> us to work every day , every corner of the planet , we 'll <unk> from the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , there 's a <unk> , and I 'm not saying to anybody who , where the <unk> works .
I don 't say that , because I want to use it .
What does , this incredible freedom of choice that we have about the work ? It 's that we have to decide , <unk> at any time , if we have to work or not .
We can go to see our son to play <unk> , with the cell phone in a <unk> , the <unk> in the other , and the <unk> , <unk> .
And even if I 'm all <unk> , every minute we see the <unk> , we 're also <unk> , " I have to answer this called ? "
" I have to answer this <unk> ? I have to tell you this letter ? "
And even when the answer is , " no , " that makes this experience <unk> of your son a lot of different than what would have been in other conditions .
So , from any <unk> , you look , and big objects , and <unk> of life , is a question of choices .
Once the world was this : <unk> , there were some possibilities , but not everything was a question of choice .
The world today is going to talk about this : The <unk> is , " Is it a <unk> , or <unk> ? "
The answer is <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> we all know , so I 'm going to talk about those <unk> .
I love this choice <unk> <unk> .
The first , <unk> , is that it <unk> instead of <unk> .
and a lot of <unk> between which choice , it becomes very difficult to do it .
I 'll give you an example of <unk> : a study <unk> <unk> <unk> .
A <unk> my <unk> has had access <unk> <unk> , <unk> society , with about a million <unk> <unk> in different companies .
What she 's discovered is that for every 10 10 solutions that are <unk> , the <unk> of <unk> <unk> 2 percent .
With 50 <unk> <unk> , there 's 10 percent in less than <unk> when you 're available in it . Why ?
Because with 50 <unk> between which <unk> , is to decide , and the choice is <unk> to <unk> .
And in <unk> , and still <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and of course , it 's never coming .
<unk> that doesn 't just mean that these <unk> <unk> food to <unk> because they don 't have enough money , it 's not just want to say that the decision is so <unk> that you can <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> 't <unk> , they 're <unk> to five <unk> per year from the <unk> of work , that would be well <unk> to <unk> .
So the <unk> is a <unk> of having <unk> choices .
And I think we 'll <unk> the world like this .
" And then , to end up with <unk> : <unk> , <unk> or <unk> ? "
You have to make the right decision , if it 's <unk> , is it ?
You don 't want to choose the bottom , and you get the wrong <unk> .
So this is the first effect . The second one is that even if we can <unk> <unk> and make choice , at the end of the <unk> of how to <unk> them .
And this for different reasons .
One of them is that with many <unk> between <unk> , if you <unk> one , it 's not perfect , it 's not perfect , it 's not perfect , it 's easy to imagine that it would be better . And what happens is that the <unk> <unk> us to <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> <unk> by the <unk> decision , and the <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> by the <unk> decision ,
even when it was a <unk> decision .
More choices are , the more choices to <unk> than any <unk> that you can be <unk> .
<unk> , there 's what <unk> call .
Dan <unk> has <unk> very well as as the value that we give things to what we <unk> .
<unk> rest , when there are many <unk> possible , it 's easy to <unk> the <unk> of <unk> and be less <unk> than being <unk> .
Here is an example . I 'm going to <unk> with all the ones that are not in New York .
But that 's what you probably <unk> .
There 's this <unk> to <unk> .
A <unk> place .
<unk> : <unk> . It 's all about it .
You don 't know anything . But what he thinks is , " Well , <unk> , it 's <unk> . "
" All my <unk> <unk> are <unk> . "
" You 're going to be <unk> in front of the house . "
And it goes two weeks , I 'm going to get to the <unk> , every day -- the possibility of <unk> where it wants .
The <unk> <unk> <unk> for what we have , even when the choice was <unk> .
And the <unk> we have from <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Here 's another example .
This <unk> tells us a lot of things .
It 's about living the moment , and maybe live slowly .
But the most important point is that anything you want , you to do not other .
The things that don 't <unk> have a lot of <unk> that can make less <unk> what we do .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> <unk> .
I tried it on my skin <unk> a new couple of <unk> .
It 's almost always <unk> .
Once the <unk> were a <unk> , <unk> them , and they <unk> them and <unk> , they were <unk> , only after they had a life and <unk> a lot of times , we <unk> to go well .
So , I started to <unk> a couple of new when the <unk> were gone , and I said , " I need a couple of <unk> , this is my <unk> . "
The <unk> said , " <unk> wants to <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> ? "
You want to <unk> them with <unk> or <unk> ?
" " Do you want to <unk> ? "
" <unk> wants to <unk> them or <unk> ? <unk> <unk> <unk> .
I was <unk> , and after a while I was able to say , " I want the guy -- that was the only guy , " I had never got it . " So , this is now , I <unk> all ' <unk> , then I got to <unk> it , with the <unk> <unk> , <unk> , with the best <unk> of the <unk> I 've ever had .
It was the <unk> . With all that choice I had <unk> the best .
But I <unk> it worse .
Why ? I have a whole book to <unk> .
The reason I was worse is that with all that choice my <unk> were <unk> , the <unk> <unk> to be <unk> .
I had <unk> <unk> . I didn 't <unk> anything <unk> when I was <unk> with <unk> , I just <unk> 100 different , I <unk> , at least one guy had to be perfect .
What I had <unk> was good , but not perfect .
After I <unk> that <unk> with what I was <unk> in <unk> to <unk> .
The <unk> of <unk> in the lives of the people don 't make the <unk> that these <unk> at the <unk> of the <unk> was <unk> .
And this <unk> less <unk> , even when the results are good .
<unk> in the world of <unk> if you realize it .
Because if you <unk> it , I don 't know what I 'm talking about .
The truth is more like this .
" It was better when it was worse , " because it was better when it was worse , it was worse , when it was worse , it was worse , it was even possible to <unk> <unk> .
<unk> , in the world that we live in -- <unk> , <unk> citizens with the <unk> of <unk> -- the <unk> we can <unk> is that things are <unk> .
You 've never got to <unk> <unk> because your <unk> , my <unk> , <unk> are <unk> .
The <unk> of happiness -- what you 're here -- is , " <unk> <unk> , " Yes , you want to . "
I mean , little <unk> moment -- I 'm really <unk> , I 'm really <unk> and my wife is really <unk> .
I couldn 't do better , I didn 't have <unk> .
But <unk> not always a <unk> thing .
<unk> , a <unk> of buy a couple of <unk> <unk> when there 's only that kind of <unk> is that when you 're not <unk> , and I 'm going to tell you , " Why ? "
" Who is <unk> ? " , it 's <unk> .
The world is the <unk> . What can I do ?
When there are hundreds of <unk> , and you get a <unk> , and you get a <unk> , and you 'll <unk> who 's the <unk> , it 's <unk> clear that you are .
I could have better .
With hundreds of <unk> available , there are no <unk> for <unk> .
So when people make decisions , even if the <unk> is <unk> , they <unk> <unk> and they <unk> to themselves .
In the last few years , the <unk> is <unk> in the <unk> world .
I think a <unk> <unk> -- not the only , but important -- of this <unk> of <unk> is just that people have <unk> experiences because the standard is too <unk> .
And when they have to <unk> this situation think <unk> is them .
So the end result is that in general , we 're better , but we 'll get worse .
Let me tell you .
This is the <unk> <unk> , what we all take good and it 's completely <unk> . It 's not true .
There is no <unk> that a little bit of choice is better than <unk> at all , but this doesn 't have a lot of choice is better than a while .
There 's a <unk> value , <unk> . I don 't know what it is .
But I 'm sure we have <unk> from a piece of the level where the choices <unk> our life .
Now , from the <unk> point -- I almost finished -- from the point of view , the <unk> is the <unk> .
What <unk> you all this choice in the <unk> society is the <unk> material .
There are many places in the world , and you know , you know , it 's not that they have <unk> choice .
The problem is they have too <unk> .
So the <unk> I 'm talking about is a <unk> <unk> , <unk> society .
And what <unk> does <unk> and <unk> is this : <unk> <unk> <unk> talked about how much those <unk> and <unk> <unk> to be <unk> . It 's a <unk> of money . It 's a <unk> of money .
I mean , these choices , <unk> and <unk> , is not just that they 're <unk> .
They 're <unk> <unk> .
They make us worse .
If a little bit of what we do in our society it <unk> to be <unk> in those where people have too few people , it 's not just about their life , but also our <unk> .
This is what <unk> call a <unk> <unk> .
A <unk> of income does well , not only the poor -- not only the poor -- because of this choice in <unk> that we 're <unk> .
To end , " <unk> , you can get all the things that you want to --
<unk> , people of culture , <unk> : " But what would you do ? "
" It 's <unk> that you can 't get to a glass <unk> . "
" A <unk> imagination , a <unk> vision of the world --
and I <unk> it like this , at the beginning .
But then , I <unk> , I realized that that that fish knows that that fish knows the long .
Because the reality of the fact that you <unk> the <unk> , so that you can 't be freedom . You can 't <unk> the freedom . You <unk> the <unk> .
If you <unk> the <unk> so that it could <unk> the <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , and they <unk> <unk> .
Everybody needs a <unk> .
This is almost certainly too <unk> , maybe even for the fish , and certainly for us .
But the <unk> of some <unk> <unk> is a <unk> for <unk> and , <unk> , for <unk> .
Thank you very much .
