<unk> year I showed these <unk> <unk> <unk> that the <unk> <unk> <unk> , which for almost three million years , has had the size of the United States <unk> , has <unk> percent .
We 're going to <unk> this <unk> of the problem because it doesn 't show the ice <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> is , in a way , the heart <unk> heart of global warming .
They <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
The next <unk> is going to be a <unk> <unk> on the last 25 years .
<unk> <unk> are <unk> in red .
You see , it 's <unk> up to the blue <unk> .
That 's the ice in <unk> , which <unk> <unk> in summer .
You can see that the <unk> ice <unk> , five years or more , it 's like the blood , here is <unk> from the body .
In 25 years , it 's been the way .
This is a problem because the <unk> is <unk> the <unk> <unk> around the ocean , where there are huge <unk> of <unk> that , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , are <unk> in <unk> by the <unk> .
<unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , that <unk> <unk> could be <unk> , and that <unk> <unk> <unk> .
In some of the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> is already <unk> by the water .
The <unk> <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> last <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> ! <unk> : she 's good . The question is if you <unk> it 's good .
That 's why this <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> from the north .
This is a river in <unk> <unk> .
<unk> had never <unk> <unk> <unk> .
This is the <unk> river , in the <unk> of <unk> .
If you want to know how the <unk> <unk> <unk> to the sea level to the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> on <unk> , here is where the sea .
These <unk> are <unk> <unk> .
On the other part of the planet : <unk> , the largest <unk> ice on the planet .
<unk> last month , the scientists have <unk> that the ice <unk> is in <unk> , and that the Western <unk> <unk> , which <unk> on some <unk> <unk> , is particularly <unk> in the <unk> .
<unk> at six feet of the <unk> , like in <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , the largest <unk> <unk> of ice , you see new <unk> , which a few years ago were <unk> .
40 percent of the world 's population <unk> water from the <unk> .
<unk> <unk> : this <unk> is the source of water <unk> of this city .
<unk> is <unk> .
But when you <unk> , the same happens to the water .
In California , <unk> on the <unk> <unk> is 40 percent .
<unk> <unk> are in the crisis .
<unk> , as you read , they 're <unk> .
<unk> <unk> in the world <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> are <unk> to a <unk> outside the normal and without <unk> .
<unk> times as much as in the last 30 years than <unk> <unk> .
This is a <unk> of all <unk> .
If you look at it in the context of the <unk> are going to see what the <unk> .
In the last five years , we 've <unk> 70 million <unk> of CO2 every 24 hours -- 25 million <unk> in the oceans .
Look at the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , from the <unk> , <unk> , and both of the parts of the <unk> <unk> , where there is a <unk> <unk> of oxygen in the ocean .
The <unk> of global warming , together with <unk> , which is 20 percent , is the use of <unk> <unk> .
The oil is a problem , and <unk> is even worse .
The United States is one of the two countries with <unk> emissions , together with China .
And it 's <unk> to build a lot of other <unk> .
But we 're <unk> to a <unk> of direction .
These are the <unk> projects in the last years and some <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
<unk> , there is a political <unk> in our country .
The <unk> of <unk> and <unk> have <unk> <unk> million dollars in the last year to <unk> <unk> <unk> , which is a <unk> .
I 'm going to give something --
<unk> <unk> , in <unk> , where I live , there was a <unk> of <unk> billion <unk> of <unk> .
Maybe you 've seen it on the <unk> .
This is the second largest flow in America .
It 's been around <unk> .
<unk> <unk> of one of the <unk> <unk> was this .
<unk> : <unk> ♫ ♫ <unk> the <unk> is a <unk> and happy guy .
It 's <unk> here in America , and it <unk> our economy .
<unk> the <unk> is <unk> <unk> .
It 's <unk> , <unk> and <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> is <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The largest <unk> society on the <unk> is <unk> <unk> . This is his <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> . <unk> <unk> -- Al <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> -- they don 't know what they 're talking about .
<unk> : So the <unk> for the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> has <unk> two <unk> .
This is one of them , one part .
<unk> : <unk> : <unk> <unk> , we see the climate change as a <unk> <unk> to our business .
That 's why we have a big amount of money in a <unk> <unk> to <unk> and <unk> the truth of <unk> .
In fact , <unk> is not <unk> .
We think it 's <unk> -- it 's got a good <unk> .
So we don 't know about climate change .
We need to do it .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> -- you 've heard about it very much .
So we <unk> a turn into a <unk> structure as it is about <unk> <unk> .
<unk> ! <unk> ! <unk> are a little <unk> , but that 's the sound of the <unk> <unk> technology .
<unk> <unk> is between the major <unk> of global warming , but the <unk> technology that you see all .
Let 's look at : this is the <unk> technology 's <unk> <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to the economic issue and the national security .
<unk> : <unk> is in the crisis ; America is in the economy ; the national security crisis .
The <unk> that <unk> all of this : our <unk> from the <unk> <unk> <unk> , like <unk> and oil .
Now , but there is a new , <unk> solution for <unk> .
<unk> America : 100 percent of <unk> energy , in 10 years .
A <unk> for <unk> America at work , <unk> more <unk> , and help <unk> global warming .
<unk> , a solution that we 're going to solve our problems .
<unk> America . <unk> more .
<unk> : This is the last one .
<unk> : <unk> : It 's about <unk> energy to America .
One of the most <unk> ways to <unk> the end of the <unk> that <unk> our planet .
<unk> : The future is here . <unk> , <unk> , <unk> new <unk> network .
<unk> <unk> 2 : <unk> <unk> <unk> for jobs
<unk> : <unk> America . It 's time to be <unk> .
<unk> : A old <unk> <unk> says , " If you want to go <unk> , go alone .
If you want to go back , go together . "
We have to go away , quickly .
Thank you very much .
<unk> year at TED I did a <unk> on <unk> .
And I decided to <unk> them on how the car works .
So , here we were . And for those who was the other time , the <unk> is the largest scientific experiment ever <unk> -- <unk> kilometers of <unk> .
<unk> is to <unk> the conditions that were in the <unk> of a second from the beginning of the universe -- until <unk> million times a second .
All of that is just <unk> .
This is the car under the <unk> .
They <unk> these <unk> <unk> in the <unk> .
This is what I work . It 's called <unk> -- <unk> <unk> feet , and it 's <unk> feet .
This is a <unk> picture of building <unk> so you can see the <unk> .
<unk> <unk> last year we <unk> the machine for the first time .
And this picture was <unk> by <unk> .
It was <unk> <unk> in the control room .
It 's a picture of the first <unk> of particles that had done all the <unk> , <unk> in <unk> , with a part of the <unk> , and <unk> particles inside the <unk> .
In other words , when I <unk> the picture of <unk> , you know that the car <unk> , which is a great <unk> .
I don 't know if it was <unk> to <unk> us more or this , when someone <unk> on Google and <unk> that the page was this .
That means that we 've had a <unk> impact beyond that scientific .
<unk> a week later , there was a problem with the machine , <unk> to these <unk> here -- these <unk> <unk> .
These <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> when the car is <unk> .
Now , the <unk> between of you <unk> the <unk> and <unk> , " It 's not true . I 'm too <unk> . "
And they can do it because when they 're very <unk> , they can make it very <unk> <unk> .
So , at least <unk> degrees <unk> degrees , a temperature <unk> at the <unk> of space between stars , these <unk> can bring that <unk> .
In one of the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> in the <unk> , there was a <unk> of <unk> .
So the <unk> <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a electric <unk> .
This was the result .
Now , this is even more <unk> if you think that these <unk> <unk> over 20 <unk> , and that 's about 30 <unk> .
They <unk> about 50 <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , what we did .
We <unk> them and <unk> .
They 're all <unk> to their <unk> .
We <unk> the end of <unk> the <unk> is going to be again <unk> .
We <unk> it , and we <unk> to get data <unk> to <unk> or <unk> , and so on our <unk> to find out what the <unk> are the universe .
Now of course , in a way , these <unk> <unk> the value of science and engineering engineering engineering <unk> . It 's easy to <unk> .
I think that it 's so hard , the fact that it 's going beyond the <unk> , I think is this the value of things like <unk> .
I 'd like to end with the words of a <unk> <unk> , who , <unk> , in <unk> of the <unk> of his <unk> , his <unk> was Michael <unk> , said , " It 's not so <unk> that it 's <unk> for the progress of the human mind as much as the <unk> that the ideas of science are <unk> , and that there are no new <unk> . "
Thank you .
I want to start with <unk> to <unk> when , as children , <unk> <unk> .
<unk> as we <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> ,
The <unk> <unk> is <unk> <unk> to the way that we <unk> part of the world around us .
So , as a <unk> <unk> from the <unk> of our <unk> with <unk> <unk> objects , and my <unk> <unk> <unk> , and I started <unk> , " And if we use a computer , instead of having the only <unk> of the <unk> as digital <unk> that <unk> on the <unk> as digital <unk> that <unk> on the <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> as digital <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> of both <unk> as digital <unk> that <unk> on both hands ,
and <unk> to our <unk> ?
The question was so interesting that we tried to explore the answer , building the <unk> .
In a few words , a <unk> is a <unk> computer as a <unk> .
In a few words , a <unk> is a <unk> computer as a <unk> .
You can <unk> them with your hand , they can " <unk> <unk> . " They can hear their movement and they have a screen and a <unk> radio <unk> .
But <unk> , they 're <unk> objects , like <unk> , you can just <unk> <unk> .
<unk> are the <unk> of a new <unk> of tools to <unk> digital information .
And as they become more <unk> , <unk> of the movement , other , and other , as they become <unk> , <unk> of the other , of how they become <unk> , we can explore new and <unk> <unk> of <unk> .
Let 's start with some simple example .
This <unk> is <unk> to show : if you <unk> it in a direction , the video <unk> video , so if you <unk> on the other side back .
These <unk> <unk> are <unk> of others .
If you <unk> them , you 're <unk> to what they 're going to .
If they come <unk> , and they can <unk> it a little bit .
If they come <unk> , and they can <unk> it a little bit .
They also <unk> their movement and <unk> .
We then realized that one of the interesting <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> was able to use <unk> of data , for example , <unk> <unk> , like it was a <unk> .
In this case , we have three <unk> <unk> as a <unk> <unk> of <unk> and I can <unk> it to <unk> the color of the central where they 're <unk> .
and I can <unk> it to <unk> the color in central where they 're <unk> .
If we get too much , we can <unk> a little bit of a place .
There are also <unk> possibilities , like <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , math and <unk> where people can try things things , and they <unk> the results immediately .
I 'm --
This is a <unk> sequence I do with a <unk> program .
Here we have a <unk> of words that half <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> , every <unk> <unk> a letter on every <unk> , <unk> , every <unk> , <unk> , every <unk> <unk> a letter on every <unk> , and while I was <unk> <unk> , he <unk> on a <unk> .
Then , after about 30 seconds , you get up , and you have a new <unk> of <unk> and new possibilities to try .
Thank you .
Here 's <unk> children in <unk> <unk> at the <unk> <unk> , I made them so I <unk> them and I <unk> a video .
They 're very <unk> .
And one of the interesting things of these kinds of <unk> is that you don 't have to give people a lot of <unk> .
I just said , " <unk> <unk> of words , " and they know exactly what to do .
Here 's other people who <unk> it .
This is our <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , there .
It actually wanted to <unk> it .
They were just <unk> , for him .
Now , this is a <unk> of a <unk> <unk> .
We had to build a <unk> for the <unk> of the <unk> . He 's <unk> .
It can <unk> new characters in the scene , <unk> their <unk> .
It can <unk> new characters in the scene , <unk> their <unk> .
Here 's , it 's going to get out .
<unk> : The sun is <unk> .
David <unk> : Now he 's brought a <unk> in the scene .
<unk> : The <unk> <unk> .
<unk> ! Yeah !
So they <unk> the <unk> and <unk> <unk> can make the characters .
<unk> : <unk> !
<unk> your story .
<unk> : <unk> !
<unk> : It 's a story with the open , and it can decide how they <unk> it .
<unk> : It 's a story with the open , and it can decide how they <unk> it .
<unk> : <unk> away , <unk> .
<unk> : The last example I have time to show you is a <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> and <unk> music .
It 's a recently <unk> , <unk> <unk> music .
The <unk> here are <unk> <unk> as a <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
<unk> of these have four different <unk> , and you can choose what you use .
You can also <unk> these <unk> in a <unk> sequence of your <unk> .
And you just <unk> it up just <unk> a sound and a sequence .
These are effects that you can control from alive , like <unk> and <unk> .
I 'm going to <unk> it up to a particular sound and then <unk> it to <unk> .
And then there are the effects of time as long and <unk> , which <unk> the entire sequence .
<unk> how it works .
<unk> : <unk> : <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> , " <unk> <unk> , " <unk> in a series , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk>
Now we 're going to have a low line .
<unk> : <unk> : Now <unk> <unk> <unk> --
<unk> : <unk> : And now I 'm going to <unk> the <unk> to the <unk> , so I can control the effect of alive .
<unk> : <unk> : I can <unk> the entire sequence time on one side or the other .
<unk> : <unk> : And now we <unk> the <unk> <unk> to give more <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> : I can <unk> the <unk> of the flight .
So I don 't have to <unk> before , but I can <unk> it , it 's <unk> , <unk> , <unk> ,
And now , finally , I can <unk> the entire <unk> <unk> <unk> on the left <unk> .
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is building new <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to how our brain work and body .
And today , I 've had time to show you one of the results of this path , and some possibilities that we 're trying to bring out of the lab .
The concept I want to <unk> you is that it 's going to <unk> this new generation of <unk> objects to <unk> the world with the <unk> media , which is <unk> information in our world in the way we want .
Thank you very much .
I don 't see the time of talking to all of you .
I 'm a <unk> .
<unk> books is my <unk> , but it 's more than that , of course .
It 's also love and <unk> of my life .
And I don 't think that it can change .
But , I said , this is , something that 's happened in my life and my career , which led me to <unk> the whole relationship with this job .
The particular thing is I wrote this book , this <unk> called " <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , " which , <unk> from my <unk> books , to be <unk> by my <unk> books , for some reason to be <unk> in the world and <unk> a big , <unk> <unk> .
And the result is that everywhere I 'm <unk> now , people <unk> me as if I was <unk> .
<unk> -- <unk> , <unk> !
<unk> to me now everyone <unk> and they say , " You don 't fear that you 're not going to be able to do it better than ?
You don 't fear to keep writing for all life to be able to make a book that can <unk> to someone ? "
<unk> you can <unk> to someone ? "
It 's <unk> , you know .
But it could go worse , except part of that I remember over 20 years ago , when I was talking to people -- I was a <unk> -- I wanted to be a <unk> .
I 'm going to be <unk> from fear .
And people say , " Don 't you know you don 't know that you 're not going to be able to successful ?
You don 't fear that the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> ?
You don 't fear to make this <unk> for all life without <unk> that nothing is ever <unk> and dying on a <unk> of <unk> with the mouth full of <unk> <unk> <unk> ?
<unk> like that , you know .
The answer -- the short answer to all these questions is , " Yeah . "
Yeah , I 'm afraid of all those things .
I 've always had fear .
And I also fear of a lot of other things that people wouldn 't happen .
Like <unk> and other things that are <unk> .
But , as I thought , what I thought and <unk> is why ?
Is it <unk> ?
It 's <unk> that anyone who <unk> <unk> <unk> to be <unk> by a job that you feel born to do .
But what 's so particular about the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to <unk> health care about a <unk> <unk> in a way that other <unk> don 't do ?
How about my father , for example , he was a <unk> <unk> and I didn 't remember once in his <unk> of activity where he was asked if she was afraid to be <unk> ?
<unk> 't it -- that <unk> of the <unk> John , how does it go ?
<unk> 't we <unk> that , <unk> ?
<unk> , engineers <unk> as a group of <unk> , they certainly have no <unk> , in <unk> , <unk> the <unk> of being <unk> <unk> .
We <unk> , we have a <unk> of this <unk> , and not only <unk> but <unk> of all kinds of things , we have this <unk> to be <unk> <unk> .
And he doesn 't want to look at the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> that , only in the <unk> century , <unk> young and often for them .
And the ones that don 't <unk> seem to be really <unk> by their <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , before you die , in the last <unk> , " <unk> my book <unk> me a little bit more , " <unk> me a little bit more extraordinary <unk> about the work of his life .
But we don 't have to <unk> when we 're saying that because we 've heard these things so long , in some way we 've got completely <unk> and <unk> that creativity is in some way , and <unk> , at the end , <unk> and the art , at the end ,
And the question I want to <unk> you to all this is today : you agree with this idea ?
It 's good for you to do that -- because it 's a <unk> distance to me , it 's not good for this <unk> .
I think it 's <unk> .
And I think it 's also <unk> , and I don 't want to <unk> <unk> in the next century .
I think it 's better to <unk> our big <unk> <unk> to live .
And I certainly know that , in my case -- it would be very <unk> to start <unk> to that <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> in which I 'm in my career .
<unk> -- <unk> -- look at , I 'm young , I 'm about 40 years old .
I 've got about four <unk> of work in me .
And it 's very <unk> that anything you 're going to happen to be <unk> by the world as the work that 's going to be <unk> after the success of my last book .
<unk> <unk> , because we 're all about <unk> <unk> , because we 're all <unk> <unk> -- is <unk> that my greatest success is to my <unk> .
Oh , <unk> , <unk> .
You know , this is the kind of <unk> that leads a person to start <unk> <unk> at nine <unk> in the morning , and I don 't want to do it .
I 'm going to continue doing this work that I love .
So , the question becomes , how that 's it ?
And so it seems to me , after many <unk> , that the way to work to keep on on <unk> is to create a <unk> <unk> <unk> , OK ?
I have to have to come a <unk> distance of security between me , which I 'm <unk> , and my natural <unk> on what the <unk> <unk> <unk> . And , as I was going to try to find out through time , trying to find other societies to see if you have better ideas and find other societies to see if you have better ideas and more <unk> .
about how to help people <unk> <unk> <unk> of creativity .
And that research has taken me to the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
<unk> because we 're going to go back and then <unk> back .
<unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> -- people don 't believe that creativity <unk> from men , OK ?
It turns out that creativity was this <unk> spirit and <unk> to men from some <unk> <unk> and <unk> to men and <unk> , for reasons and <unk> .
<unk> <unk> these <unk> <unk> <unk> of creativity of creativity .
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> to have a <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> from <unk> .
The <unk> were the same idea , but they <unk> the <unk> that species of spirit without a <unk> .
which is <unk> , because the <unk> didn 't really understand that a <unk> was <unk> somebody .
And I thought that a <unk> was this sort of <unk> <unk> <unk> literally in the <unk> of the study of an artist , a little artist like the <unk> <unk> , and <unk> the <unk> of <unk> the <unk> of that work of the artist artist and <unk> the result of that work .
<unk> <unk> , that 's the distance I 'm talking -- that <unk> <unk> that <unk> you <unk> from the results of your work .
And everybody thought it was so that it was like , right ?
So the artists were <unk> by <unk> things , like the too <unk> , like that too <unk> , you know ?
If your work was <unk> , you wouldn 't <unk> everything to <unk> , everybody <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
If your job <unk> , it wasn 't all your <unk> , right ?
Everybody thought it was your <unk> to be a <unk> .
And so people are <unk> <unk> creativity in <unk> for a long time .
Then the <unk> <unk> and everything <unk> , and we <unk> this great idea ; we put the human human being at the center of the universe and the center without any more to <unk> that <unk> <unk> from the <unk> .
This was the principle of <unk> <unk> and people began to think that creativity is <unk> completely from the <unk> .
And for the first time in history , they <unk> to <unk> this or that artist as a <unk> <unk> rather than a person with <unk> .
And I have to <unk> , I think it was a big <unk> .
I think you 're going to have a simple person to believe that you are like a <unk> , like the source , <unk> and <unk> of all the <unk> <unk> , <unk> and <unk> is a <unk> responsibility for a <unk> to human <unk> .
It 's like <unk> to someone to <unk> the sun .
<unk> and <unk> completely <unk> the <unk> and creates all these <unk> <unk> <unk> on the <unk> .
And I think it was this pressure that <unk> artists in the <unk> 500 years .
And , if that 's true , and I think it 's that , the question becomes , and right now ?
Can we do that <unk> ?
<unk> go back to a <unk> understanding of the relationship between humans and <unk> <unk> .
Or maybe not .
Maybe we can 't <unk> 500 years of thinking in an <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And there 's probably people in the audience who <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> on the <unk> of , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> people to <unk> on their projects .
You probably don 't want to all of this .
But the question I 'd like to ask you is -- why don 't it ?
Why don 't we <unk> that way ?
Because it has more than any other thing I 've ever heard about to <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> process .
A process of a process that , as anyone who ever <unk> to do something -- so , basically , everybody -- you know , you don 't <unk> <unk> .
And in fact , it 's a completely <unk> .
I 've been <unk> this <unk> <unk> with the extraordinary <unk> <unk> , who 's 90 years old , but that was a <unk> for all of life and he said that during his <unk> <unk> , <unk> out in the <unk> <unk> , <unk> out in the fields , and <unk> it , inside of the <unk> .
He said that it was like a <unk> <unk> of air .
And that <unk> <unk> <unk> to her from the <unk> .
We <unk> it , because he did <unk> the land below its feet .
I decided to have one thing to do at that point and was , words , " <unk> as a <unk> . "
And so he <unk> up to the house and was <unk> by this <unk> , and it wouldn 't have to do anything that take a paper of paper and a <unk> enough <unk> , <unk> and <unk> on the page .
Sometimes I couldn 't get enough enough , so <unk> and <unk> and <unk> without being able to get home and the <unk> through and she would <unk> the <unk> through and she would <unk> the <unk> and she would <unk> through the <unk> , looking for , as she said , " another <unk> . "
Then there were those times -- this piece , never <unk> it -- there was no <unk> of times when the <unk> was almost <unk> , right ?
So , he was <unk> home and he was looking for the paper and the <unk> through , and he <unk> a <unk> just in the while he was <unk> , and then he was like , and then he was like , and then he was <unk> up and he was <unk> with the other hand and <unk> .
It <unk> the tail and the <unk> in his body and the <unk> on the page .
And in these cases , the <unk> would be <unk> on the page and <unk> but <unk> , the <unk> <unk> to the <unk> <unk> to the first one .
So when you <unk> it -- it 's <unk> , it 's exactly <unk> to my <unk> process .
Not my <unk> process -- I 'm not a <unk> !
I 'm a <unk> , and my way of <unk> is ; I 'm <unk> at the same <unk> every day and work and work on top .
But even me , in my <unk> , I <unk> against that .
And I 'm sure that many of you are doing this .
You know , even if the job and ideas , I <unk> to <unk> from a certain source , I couldn 't <unk> <unk> .
And what is this thing ?
And how can we <unk> it in it <unk> , but , rather , that <unk> <unk> us ?
And as I 'm <unk> , the best example I have is the <unk> <unk> <unk> , which I 've been <unk> several years ago for a <unk> .
And I was talking about this , and you know , <unk> , for the <unk> of life was the <unk> artist <unk> , looking for for <unk> , <unk> , <unk> these <unk> <unk> <unk> totally <unk> .
But then he <unk> , he was <unk> , and one day while he was <unk> on a <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> everything for him .
It 's going fast and everything of a <unk> <unk> , that little <unk> of <unk> , which comes into his head as the <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , and it wants , you know , it 's wonderful , and the <unk> , but it doesn 't know how to <unk> it .
It 's got a paper of paper , it doesn 't have a <unk> .
So he starts to hear this sort of old <unk> <unk> grow in him , like , " I 'm going to lose , and <unk> <unk> from this song <unk> .
I 'm not <unk> enough , and I can 't <unk> . "
And instead of going to <unk> , they <unk> .
<unk> the whole process of <unk> and did something completely new .
I just <unk> the sky and said , " <unk> , don 't you see I 'm <unk> ? "
" It seems to <unk> that a song now ?
If you really want to <unk> , you 're in a <unk> moment when I can take care of you .
<unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> more today .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . "
And his <unk> process after this .
Not the work , the work was still <unk> as always .
But the process , and the <unk> <unk> that <unk> was <unk> when he was <unk> when he <unk> the <unk> , the <unk> that he <unk> out of , and he would <unk> it from , he was not to be a <unk> thing and <unk> .
but I <unk> this <unk> , wonderful <unk> <unk> a conversation between <unk> and this <unk> thing that <unk> and <unk> that was not <unk> .
So , how much the story is to change a little bit as well as I <unk> and already <unk> once .
This idea , I was when I was <unk> " <unk> , <unk> , " and I was in one of the <unk> of the <unk> that we 're all working on something , and you don 't see that it 's going to be a <unk> , that 's going to be the book .
Not just <unk> , their <unk> book .
And we started thinking about <unk> this project .
But then I 'm <unk> to <unk> that I <unk> the air and <unk> .
So I <unk> my face on the <unk> and <unk> my <unk> a <unk> <unk> of the room .
And I said <unk> , " <unk> , what , both of know that if this book is not going to be <unk> , right ?
Because as you see I 'm <unk> everything I have , I don 't have more of this .
So if you want it to be better , you have to <unk> and do your part .
OK . But if you don 't do that , you know what , I don 't do it .
I started writing the same because it 's my job .
And I would like you to <unk> that I 've been <unk> to do my part " Because it 's so , OK -- <unk> does it in the <unk> of the North Africa , people <unk> to <unk> the <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , music <unk> , <unk> music that <unk> hours to <unk> on the <unk> .
And they were always <unk> , because the <unk> were <unk> and they were <unk> .
But every once in a <unk> , something <unk> , and one of these <unk> artists actually <unk> .
And I know you know what I 'm talking about , because I know you 've all seen that you have seen , at some point , a <unk> like that .
It was like , if time you <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> through a kind of <unk> and he wasn 't doing anything different from usually , like the <unk> <unk> first , but it all <unk> .
And suddenly , they don 't just <unk> as a human .
But they <unk> out of the <unk> and <unk> in the fire of the <unk> .
And when this <unk> , at the time , people knew what was , he was going to <unk> with his name .
<unk> your hands and <unk> <unk> , " <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , God , " God . "
That 's God , you know .
<unk> <unk> -- when the <unk> <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> , <unk> this <unk> with them and the <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> , " <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , " <unk> , <unk> , " which you can still feel in <unk> or in <unk> .
In <unk> , when an artist did something impossible and <unk> , " <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , " <unk> , <unk> , " <unk> , <unk> -- a <unk> of God .
And it 's <unk> because we need it .
But , the problem comes after , for the <unk> itself , when you <unk> and <unk> that are 11 of <unk> <unk> and <unk> it of God doesn 't have more .
It 's just a <unk> <unk> with great <unk> , and maybe you never <unk> to that <unk> .
And maybe no one <unk> the name of God 's still <unk> , and what it has to do with the rest of his life ?
It 's hard .
This is one of the most <unk> <unk> to make a <unk> life .
But maybe it doesn 't have to be so <unk> if you can 't believe , <unk> , that the most <unk> of your being come from yourself .
But let me just <unk> you get data into a <unk> source of this <unk> part of this <unk> part of your life that you have to go to <unk> when you 're finished .
And , you know , if we think it all .
And so I started <unk> , and it 's certainly how I <unk> it for several months during the <unk> of the book that I was <unk> , <unk> , <unk> of my success .
And what I have to continue to <unk> when I feel <unk> from that is , I don 't fear .
You don 't <unk> . You 're just your job .
<unk> <unk> for your side , whatever it can be .
If your work is <unk> , it 's <unk> , <unk> .
If the <unk> , you 're going to <unk> <unk> <unk> some kind of <unk> , for just a moment through your <unk> , then , " <unk> ! "
<unk> , you do the same your <unk> .
And " <unk> ! " <unk> ! "
I think that 's <unk> .
" <unk> ! " <unk> ! " <unk> ! " <unk> ! "
Thank you .
Thank you .
<unk> <unk> : <unk> !
As you know , I 've already talked about some of these projects on the human genome , what it can <unk> and discovery of new genes .
We 're going to <unk> a new path : we started <unk> biology and starting from that digital code , we 're <unk> in a new <unk> of biology , <unk> and <unk> life .
We 've always tried to ask for big questions .
" What 's life ? " It 's something that many <unk> , I think have to be <unk> at various levels .
We 've tried different <unk> , <unk> to the <unk> terms .
We 're <unk> for about 20 years now .
When we <unk> the human genome <unk> to go from the <unk> world of biology in the digital world of the digital world of the computer .
Now we ask ourselves : can we <unk> life , or create new life from this digital universe ?
This is a map of a little <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> , which is the species from the <unk> genome between those that can <unk> in the lab .
And we tried to reduce the genome to <unk> a little bit more small .
We can <unk> a <unk> of the <unk> of the about 500 of the <unk> that are here .
But when we look at his <unk> map , it 's very simple <unk> to our own .
<unk> , that 's simple .
But when we look at all the genes that we can <unk> , one at the time , is very <unk> that this can bring a <unk> cell .
So I thought the only way to <unk> was <unk> this <unk> so that we could <unk> the <unk> to <unk> some of these questions .
And so we started the <unk> of " Can we <unk> a <unk> ? "
Can the chemistry <unk> of <unk> these big molecules that we 've never been able to create before ?
And , in case <unk> , can we make a <unk> ?
A <unk> is just a piece of <unk> <unk> material .
The speed we can <unk> the life is <unk> <unk> to <unk> .
Our <unk> to write the <unk> code , instead , it 's pretty slowly , but it 's <unk> .
And our most <unk> results of them bring them into a <unk> <unk> .
We 've <unk> over 15 years ago .
The process has <unk> a lot of <unk> , <unk> with a <unk> <unk> before he <unk> the first experiments .
But we 've discovered that we <unk> is very difficult .
There are <unk> of thousands of cars in the world that <unk> small <unk> of DNA , of the <unk> of 30 to 50 <unk> and it 's a <unk> process . The <unk> along , the <unk> is there .
So we had to develop a new way to <unk> these <unk> and <unk> the <unk> .
And this was our first <unk> , starting from digital information of <unk> <unk> genome .
It 's a little virus that bacteria <unk> .
We designed the <unk> , we <unk> the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> a DNA <unk> of about <unk> <unk> .
The interesting part is when we took this piece of <unk> material <unk> and <unk> it in bacteria , the bacteria have <unk> to read this code , and <unk> the <unk> particles .
<unk> particles have been <unk> by cells , they 're <unk> back and they <unk> the <unk> <unk> .
I 've been talking about a recently <unk> members of the <unk> <unk> industry that they have certainly <unk> this model .
They <unk> more than you .
We think this is a situation where software can actually build its own <unk> in a <unk> system .
But we wanted to do the greatest things in the big .
We had to build the entire <unk> of <unk> .
They 're more than <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> code .
So we thought we 're going to <unk> in the size of the virus , so that we can change the <unk> to understand what the <unk> are <unk> cell .
<unk> is <unk> , and if you <unk> information <unk> in a computer , these must be very <unk> .
When we <unk> this genome for the first time in <unk> , the standard <unk> was a <unk> for every 10 <unk> <unk> .
We 've discovered , <unk> , 30 <unk> . If we used that original <unk> <unk> , we never had to be able to make it work .
One part of the process is to design <unk> <unk> 50 <unk> <unk> that <unk> with all the other <unk> of 50 <unk> to build smaller <unk> <unk> <unk> .
We had <unk> elements here .
You probably read that <unk> us from the <unk> .
So we have a <unk> <unk> on four <unk> : A , <unk> , <unk> and <unk>
<unk> of those <unk> <unk> <unk> together , about 20 <unk> , and there 's a <unk> order of <unk> every <unk> .
So we can use the code for <unk> words , <unk> , <unk> .
What we did at the beginning was <unk> .
Some of them have been <unk> by the fact that it wasn 't <unk> .
We designed these <unk> to just <unk> <unk> with <unk> .
There are <unk> that we <unk> them and <unk> <unk> .
And we started <unk> <unk> , <unk> with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to them to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> every step , we made these <unk> <unk> so that we 're <unk> <unk> that we 're <unk> to create a very <unk> <unk> <unk> as you 're going to see in a minute .
We 're trying to <unk> the process .
So , this seems to be a <unk> of <unk> .
When we <unk> these <unk> <unk> , we 're more than 100 <unk> <unk> , you don 't have to be <unk> directly in the <unk> <unk> .
You get the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> biology .
So we 've <unk> other <unk> .
<unk> of another <unk> called <unk> <unk> , which is in biology <unk> to <unk> the DNA <unk> .
Here is an example .
This <unk> , called <unk> <unk> , can <unk> three million <unk> of <unk> .
You can see in the <unk> <unk> as his <unk> is <unk> .
<unk> hours -- it 's <unk> exactly as it was before .
We 're going to be able to do that .
These organisms can completely <unk> .
We 're going to live under <unk> .
I 'm absolutely sure that life <unk> in space , and they 're <unk> to find new <unk> of water .
<unk> , <unk> has shown that this happens .
This is a picture of the <unk> that we 've built these <unk> , just using these <unk> , just using the <unk> <unk> design of <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> <unk> them .
This picture was not <unk> with a <unk> <unk> , but it was a <unk> <unk> .
It 's such a big <unk> that we can <unk> with a <unk> <unk> .
These are pictures that <unk> a time of about six seconds .
This is the <unk> we 've done a little time ago .
They 're more than <unk> <unk> code .
It 's the largest <unk> of a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> by man .
It 's got a <unk> <unk> <unk> to 300 million .
If you <unk> it with a 10 <unk> without , we 'll have to <unk> pages to <unk> this code .
Now , how do we make it work ? How can we <unk> ?
<unk> , through a virus is a kids from kids .
It 's a little bit more <unk> when you use of the bacteria .
It 's <unk> even when it comes to the <unk> cells like our : you just <unk> the <unk> and <unk> another , which is that basically the <unk> of <unk> .
In <unk> , the <unk> is <unk> inside the cell , but we have <unk> <unk> that we are able to make a <unk> <unk> from one cell to another cell <unk> .
We <unk> a <unk> <unk> from a kind of <unk> .
<unk> are different as men from <unk> .
We 've <unk> some <unk> <unk> in more <unk> that we could decide which to <unk> what this <unk> is .
And then he <unk> it with the <unk> so that they <unk> all the <unk> .
And when we put it in the cell was <unk> and <unk> our <unk> the new <unk> went into the cell .
And we had to <unk> that we didn 't want to go beyond , but we tried to <unk> more <unk> in there .
This is one of the major <unk> of evolution .
We found that <unk> species have <unk> a second or a third <unk> somewhere , <unk> in a second thousands of new <unk> to that species .
So who thinks about evolution as a <unk> , only <unk> at the time you <unk> doesn 't understand that much of biology .
We were <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> DNA .
The <unk> that was in the cell didn 't <unk> one .
The <unk> <unk> we <unk> it .
It 's <unk> , and it <unk> the other <unk> as a <unk> material , has <unk> it , and we <unk> with just the cell and the new <unk> .
It became blue because of the genes we 've <unk> .
And in a short <unk> of time , all of the <unk> of a species are <unk> , and it <unk> of everything in a new species , <unk> on the new software that we <unk> in the cell .
All the <unk> are <unk> , and the <unk> are <unk> , and when they <unk> the code , they 're <unk> exactly what we 've <unk> you .
Now , this may be <unk> <unk> , but it <unk> the software DNA can change things in a fairly <unk> way .
Now , I 've already <unk> that 's not about <unk> -- but of <unk> <unk> from <unk> three million years and a half of evolution , and I 've already told that maybe we 're going to create a new version of the <unk> <unk> that we 're <unk> new <unk> <unk> on this <unk> .
Why do that ?
I think it 's pretty <unk> when we think about our <unk> .
We 're going to go from six and a half billion people to <unk> billion in the next 40 years .
Right to give an example : I was born in <unk> .
Now there are three people on the planet to <unk> in <unk> ; in 40 years , there 's going to be four .
We 're <unk> now to find food , water and <unk> and <unk> , <unk> water and <unk> , <unk> water for six and a half billion people .
We 're going to get it even more <unk> to do it for nine billion .
<unk> more than five billion <unk> , over 30 billion <unk> of <unk> .
That means a hundred million <unk> a day .
When we 're trying to find <unk> <unk> , or any kind of <unk> process to <unk> , it will be a huge challenge .
In more we have to realize that the whole <unk> of CO2 from these materials that we <unk> into the atmosphere .
At the day , we 've been <unk> in the world , we have a <unk> with about 20 million genes , and I like to think that are the <unk> <unk> for the future .
The <unk> industry is only about a <unk> of <unk> , and think about how many different things are <unk> out .
Our <unk> here is <unk> data from the <unk> reality and our imagination .
We have now <unk> , through these <unk> <unk> of <unk> , able to create what we call <unk> <unk> <unk> .
We can make a big robot that can produce a million <unk> a day .
Think of <unk> these 20 million different genes or try to <unk> the <unk> to produce <unk> or <unk> , new <unk> , we can change , through a little team , and create more biology now that in the last 20 years of science .
And it 's just a standard <unk> .
We can choose to <unk> , production of <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
This is a <unk> of some software <unk> that we 're working on to be able to <unk> and design species on the computer .
Well , we don 't know how they 're going to be .
We know exactly what their <unk> code is .
We 're <unk> on the <unk> <unk> generation .
You also see that you 're going to be <unk> from the <unk> was an experiment .
We 've <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , that we 're going to be soon from <unk> to <unk> <unk> as the <unk> <unk> or different kinds of <unk> .
But the only way that biology can have a big impact without <unk> the cost of food and <unk> the <unk> would be CO2 as much as much as as much as as the <unk> as we 're working on to design that can achieve this purpose , and we think we can have the first <unk> of <unk> <unk> in about 18 months .
<unk> <unk> with CO2 is a <unk> , but in our <unk> <unk> in the world , we 've found different <unk> .
This is a <unk> that we <unk> in <unk> .
It <unk> in the deep ocean , about <unk> meters of the water temperature .
We 're <unk> from CO2 using hydrogen <unk> as a source of energy .
We 're trying to understand whether we can <unk> CO2 , that can easily be <unk> through <unk> , <unk> that it can easily be <unk> through the CO2 , to drive this process .
So we <unk> to think that we could be able to <unk> what the basic question is that we , " what life is , " We , we have the <unk> goal to <unk> the entire industry .
<unk> . If you can 't do it from TED , where can you ?
It 's a <unk> <unk> of energy .
<unk> , we 're working for using the same <unk> to create <unk> .
You 've seen this year with flu , we 're always <unk> back a year and with a dollar in less when it 's about finding the right .
I think what you can change is building <unk> <unk> in <unk> .
Here 's how the future could start look <unk> , now , the tree of evolution , <unk> evolution with bacteria , <unk> , <unk> evolution with bacteria , <unk> , and finally <unk> cells .
We 're in so far from <unk> people .
Our purpose is to make a long enough of living in order to try to <unk> it . Thank you very much .
First of all I 'm going to show you , the <unk> possible , some <unk> work , new technology that we 've taken at <unk> <unk> <unk> to a year ago .
It 's a environment that you can <unk> in both at the local level that you can <unk> with a huge amount of data .
Here we 're seeing <unk> <unk> of <unk> photos with a kind of <unk> <unk> and <unk> , for a quick <unk> , <unk> images , <unk> .
And it doesn 't matter how much the amount of information that we see , how big it is these <unk> of data or images .
Most of them are common photographs , but this is a <unk> <unk> from the <unk> of <unk> , and <unk> in the <unk> of 300 <unk> .
It doesn 't make any difference because the only thing that <unk> the <unk> of a system like this is the number of <unk> on your screen at any time . It 's also a very <unk> architecture .
This is a whole book , example of data , not images .
This is the <unk> <unk> <unk> . Every <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> .
And to <unk> that 's really about images and not images , we can do something like that , to actually see that 's a real <unk> of the text , not a picture .
It could be a way to read a little <unk> book .
I don 't <unk> it .
This is a <unk> example . This is a <unk> number of The <unk> .
Every big image is the beginning of a <unk> .
And it really gives you the pleasure and the experience of <unk> <unk> , or a <unk> , which is for nature a <unk> of a <unk> or a <unk> , which is for nature .
We also did something with the corner of this particular number of The <unk> .
We created a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> than you use in a very high <unk> than you use in a normal <unk> , and we 've <unk> the content .
If you want to see the <unk> of this <unk> , you can see them here .
Or other models , or even <unk> <unk> .
And that 's really <unk> some of these ideas to <unk> the <unk> of space on the screen .
We think that this <unk> to put into the <unk> and other <unk> <unk> <unk> , and other <unk> <unk> .
Of course , <unk> is one of the most <unk> <unk> for this kind of technology .
And I don 't want to lose time , if we don 't say that we have <unk> <unk> to give them a field .
These are all the streets in the United States <unk> above an <unk> image of NASA .
So I 'm going to start with something else .
This is actually alive on the Web ; you can see it .
It 's a project called <unk> , which <unk> two different technologies .
One is <unk> , and the other is a <unk> research that was really interesting that made by <unk> <unk> , a student of Washington , with the <unk> of Washington , with the help of <unk> <unk> <unk> . A <unk> <unk> .
And it 's alive on the Web , <unk> by <unk> .
You can see when we do this kind of <unk> , where we can go from an image to the other and have this kind of experience <unk> .
But the <unk> <unk> of the images here actually has a meaning .
<unk> <unk> of <unk> computers have <unk> these images together , so that they <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> in which the <unk> <unk> all <unk> <unk> on the <unk> <unk> are <unk> . And so you see some <unk> of a <unk> or <unk> <unk> , and these things are all <unk> at the <unk> level .
I don 't know if I 've got time to show you some other environment .
There are a lot more <unk> .
I want to go directly to one of the <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> data , and this <unk> from a <unk> <unk> that we 've done to work for the first time the summer to show you what we 're really going to work on the <unk> technology , <unk> <unk> . And it 's not so much <unk> by looking at the <unk> we 've put in the website .
We had to <unk> some <unk> and so on .
This is a <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> images of kinds of <unk> in <unk> , other than <unk> <unk> , other <unk> and <unk> . <unk> of these <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
So they 're all <unk> images and they 're all <unk> <unk> on the <unk> level like this .
And you can <unk> this <unk> way .
You know , I would never have thought of <unk> to work to <unk> .
It 's very <unk> <unk> <unk> .
I think we 're going to see that it 's a lot of different kinds of <unk> : that 's cell phones <unk> , a <unk> number , <unk> , <unk> number , <unk> in this environment .
And if I can , I can <unk> out the <unk> ones .
Many are <unk> by <unk> , etc .
There 's a series of photographs -- <unk> .
This is a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
We can go from the <unk> to the physics of this environment .
The <unk> point is that we can do with social environment . This is now <unk> from <unk> from the whole memory of how we <unk> the earth , from the point of view and <unk> all that data together .
All of those pictures become <unk> together , greater than the <unk> parts .
You have a model of the entire <unk> <unk> .
Think about this as the <unk> of the work of <unk> <unk> <unk> on Earth .
It 's something that 's going to be <unk> as people as they <unk> it , and which you 're going to <unk> it with the use .
Their photos are <unk> with <unk> <unk> by other people .
If someone comes the idea of <unk> all these <unk> <unk> , my name picture of <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> all of that data is <unk> of all those data , and I can use it as a <unk> point to <unk> in that space , in that <unk> , using the <unk> of anyone else , and have a social experience .
Of course , a <unk> of all this is <unk> models of every interesting part of the earth , <unk> not just <unk> by <unk> <unk> and <unk> images .
Thank you very much .
Chris Anderson : I realized ? What your software your software <unk> to do is that at some point , in the next few years , all of the photographs that 's <unk> from anyone in the world will be <unk> <unk> ?
<unk> : Yeah . What 's doing is basically finding out .
It 's creating <unk> , if you want , between images .
And it 's <unk> it 's <unk> it 's <unk> .
And what it becomes very interesting if you think about the <unk> of information that many of these images are <unk> .
As you do a <unk> <unk> , you <unk> a <unk> and the text on the page , it 's got a lot of information about images .
Now , what happens if that picture <unk> to all your photos ?
So , the amount of <unk> <unk> and the amount of <unk> that <unk> is really enormous . It 's a <unk> effect of the network .
CA : <unk> , it 's really incredible . <unk> .
<unk> : I 'm going to tell you a lot .
One of the main <unk> when you <unk> and one of the <unk> research is to be able to live in who has no <unk> the <unk> <unk> , among who <unk> the <unk> <unk> , <unk> the <unk> <unk> from the <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> from the <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
You might think that <unk> <unk> are still <unk> beyond the <unk> <unk> , or the <unk> <unk> <unk> are still <unk> <unk> , or that <unk> , the <unk> still <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> , to <unk> the <unk> of <unk> , and that the idea that the world in which we live in in which , the world doesn 't exist in which , is not <unk> in a <unk> sense , but only is a model of reality ,
the <unk> of a particular <unk> of <unk> choices that our <unk> has done , good or evil , many <unk> ago .
And , of course , all <unk> of the <unk> <unk> .
Everybody <unk> . Everybody <unk> .
We 're <unk> to <unk> <unk> .
We have to deal with the death <unk> , so we don 't <unk> if we <unk> and <unk> --
We all have an art .
What <unk> is the <unk> of the song , the <unk> of every culture .
It doesn 't matter that matter that 's the <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> , or the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , or the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , or a <unk> in the heart of the <unk> .
He was my <unk> of journey in <unk> a month ago , or a <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> , on the <unk> <unk> , on the <unk> , the <unk> mother of the world .
All of these <unk> are <unk> that there are other ways of <unk> other ways of moving around the world .
And , if you <unk> a second , it 's a concept that can give you hope .
<unk> , the <unk> <unk> of the world create a <unk> of <unk> life and <unk> that <unk> the planet , and it 's important for the <unk> of the planet as the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And you can think of this <unk> <unk> as a <unk> and you can <unk> the <unk> of all the <unk> , dreams , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> in being by being by the human imagination of the <unk> of the <unk> .
<unk> is the fantastic <unk> of humanity .
It 's the <unk> of what we are and what we can be as <unk> species .
And <unk> the <unk> was <unk> <unk> <unk> was successful at <unk> and <unk> much faster .
<unk> <unk> , for example , <unk> that 50 percent of all species has been or is on the <unk> of the <unk> simply because it 's <unk> , or -- in the <unk> <unk> -- in the <unk> <unk> -- and you don 't even even even even <unk> to the <unk> -- that of the diversity .
The <unk> of this is , of course , the <unk> <unk> .
When you 're <unk> <unk> <unk> on this planet .
A language is not just <unk> by a <unk> or a <unk> of <unk> rules .
A language is the <unk> of the human spirit .
It 's the middle that the <unk> of every culture is coming in the material world .
Every language is a forest of the mind , a <unk> , a <unk> of <unk> possibilities .
And of those <unk> <unk> , while we 're sitting here at least half is no longer <unk> in the <unk> of the children 's <unk> .
They 're no longer <unk> to the children , which means , unless you 're dead .
What 's more <unk> than the <unk> of being <unk> by the <unk> , of being the last to talk a language , of not having a way to <unk> the <unk> of <unk> or <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> or <unk> ?
This <unk> <unk> was a <unk> of somebody in the world every two weeks . Every two weeks , a <unk> <unk> and door with itself in the <unk> <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> of a <unk> .
And I know that some of you know , " <unk> 't it better ?
The world wouldn 't be a better place if we all the same language ? " <unk> , then we 're all talking about it . <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> .
<unk> of a <unk> thing that means that you can 't talk about your own language .
I 'd like to make you today to make you a journey through the <unk> --
a little journey in the <unk> to give you a <unk> of what we 're <unk> .
Many of us are <unk> that when I say " different ways of <unk> . " I mean , " I really mean different ways of <unk> .
So , for example this <unk> <unk> , the <unk> of <unk> , which <unk> to the <unk> of <unk> from the river <unk> of <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
It 's a <unk> that 's not able to <unk> the blue color in the green because the <unk> is <unk> in the time of the forest , which <unk> the <unk> .
They have a <unk> language and a <unk> rule , <unk> <unk> . " <unk> <unk> " : you have to <unk> a different language .
And all of that has <unk> in the past <unk> , though the <unk> is that in these <unk> families they 're talking about six or seven <unk> <unk> because of the <unk> <unk> <unk> nobody 's <unk> .
You <unk> to listen and then we start talking about .
And one of the most interesting <unk> I lived with , the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , an incredible <unk> that had the first <unk> in <unk> .
In <unk> five <unk> have <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
They 've done by the top photographs that <unk> them in <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> , which this <unk> of the <unk> forest had never seen anything .
They <unk> the photos of the land , they <unk> them to find a form or a <unk> , and they didn 't know anything , they <unk> <unk> <unk> with the <unk> .
But the <unk> don 't only <unk> <unk> .
They <unk> them .
<unk> percent of <unk> <unk> was <unk> by their own .
We 're <unk> to eight <unk> and found two <unk> of death and when we <unk> to know , they <unk> that one of them was <unk> so that he died , and then they <unk> the same .
<unk> were able to recognize the animal <unk> from 40 <unk> and <unk> the species .
In the first ' <unk> , I was a really interesting job when my <unk> <unk> <unk> me if I wanted to go to <unk> between <unk> societies <unk> to the <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
To make sense of <unk> , I should have understand culture <unk> and that <unk> is not <unk> <unk> .
It 's pretty much of a <unk> <unk> vision of the world .
Very interesting .
If you <unk> to <unk> the <unk> of the world , what <unk> me ?
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , etc .
A continent comes out , thinking about thinking that <unk> Africa has no <unk> <unk> . And that 's not the <unk> of these <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> during the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> .
What it makes it interesting is the <unk> relationship between life and death .
So <unk> are <unk> the <unk> .
<unk> can be <unk> by the <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and they 're <unk> <unk> to the <unk> of the live in such a short <unk> , the <unk> becomes the <unk> .
That 's why <unk> <unk> <unk> go to <unk> talking about God .
We <unk> in <unk> and <unk> God . "
And when you 're <unk> , is the spirit that you can <unk> , how can you make you <unk> ?
So , they <unk> to these incredible events : <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a rather strong <unk> of the power of the mind on the body , when it 's <unk> in a state of <unk> <unk> .
I <unk> all the <unk> that I 've lived with the most <unk> <unk> are the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , in the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> of the <unk> civilization that once <unk> on the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> on the <unk> <unk> .
In a blood continent , this <unk> never been <unk> by <unk> .
<unk> <unk> are <unk> by a <unk> , but their <unk> is extraordinary <unk> .
<unk> <unk> are <unk> by <unk> to <unk> <unk> by four years , and they 're <unk> in a world <unk> and <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> for 18 years .
Two <unk> of nine years old <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , which is now <unk> in the <unk> of mother , now are <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> .
For all this time , they 're <unk> to the values of their society , values that they <unk> their <unk> and only their <unk> <unk> <unk> -- or to say the <unk> <unk> .
At the end of this incredible <unk> , they 're <unk> out and for the first time in their life , at the age of 18 , see an <unk> . And in the moment of the first <unk> , when the sun <unk> the <unk> <unk> , everything they have been <unk> in <unk> . <unk> does a <unk> <unk> , everything they 've learned in the <unk> . <unk> does a <unk> says :
" <unk> ? <unk> as I told you .
It 's <unk> . Now it 's <unk> . "
They 're <unk> and they 're saying that we , <unk> <unk> , we are the <unk> of the world 's <unk> .
This <unk> level is extremely important .
When we think about <unk> <unk> and the environment <unk> <unk> and the old history of the <unk> <unk> , which is a <unk> concept in his <unk> or maybe <unk> <unk> <unk> and say that these <unk> are closer to the Earth of us .
<unk> <unk> are not <unk> or <unk> <unk> by the <unk> .
There is no space for these things in the <unk> <unk> of <unk> or in the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> , but it 's <unk> to time and <unk> , they 've created a <unk> of the Earth , and they 've got <unk> <unk> -- but on a <unk> <unk> -- the concept that the Earth can live only because it 's <unk> by human consciousness .
What does that mean ?
Let me say that a <unk> of the <unk> that <unk> the mountain is a spirit <unk> that <unk> its <unk> is going to be a human being <unk> <unk> different , and it will have a well different relationship with the mountain or that place a <unk> <unk> that <unk> a mountain is a <unk> of <unk> to be <unk> .
which is a <unk> of a spirit or a <unk> <unk> is <unk> .
What 's interesting is the <unk> that <unk> the relationship between <unk> and the natural world .
I grew up in the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> that the <unk> <unk> to be <unk> .
That made me a human being different from my <unk> friends who believe that <unk> are the <unk> <unk> of <unk> and the <unk> <unk> of <unk> and the <unk> <unk> that live in the <unk> <unk> of the world , <unk> that are <unk> in the <unk> <unk> .
If we <unk> that these <unk> can actually create different , we could actually start to understand some of their <unk> . They would be <unk> this <unk> .
I <unk> this picture in <unk> in the <unk> <unk> .
Maybe some of you 've heard about the <unk> , the most powerful <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> .
What it makes the <unk> is not the <unk> potential of the <unk> , but it 's <unk> . It 's <unk> by two elements .
On one hand , this <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> a series of <unk> , <unk> and <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
<unk> the only <unk> is a <unk> <unk> that <unk> a little bit of the <unk> , but it 's <unk> with a <unk> of a <unk> 's family <unk> said <unk> .
This <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , very similar to the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
If you 're going to see the <unk> <unk> <unk> , the <unk> that they 're doing from a different <unk> of species , <unk> it <unk> .
<unk> that <unk> on the <unk> is a little bit of a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> on a sea of electricity . <unk> 't creates a <unk> of electricity . It doesn 't create a <unk> of the reality of the reality .
I often <unk> with my <unk> , Richard <unk> <unk> , the man who <unk> the age of <unk> <unk> . He 's found the <unk> <unk> in the ' <unk> .
<unk> my <unk> can 't be <unk> these <unk> as <unk> because if you 've done you can 't tell anybody to be <unk> . <unk> can 't be <unk> because they 're <unk> by a <unk> that is , of course in the <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
It 's possible to <unk> only if you <unk> with other <unk> <unk> that <unk> the <unk> .
Now , the <unk> is the beautiful <unk> that are in this <unk> are <unk> <unk> , the same kind of necessary to <unk> the <unk> . The question <unk> <unk> : in a <unk> of <unk> species of plants , how are they <unk> <unk> two <unk> don 't similar , but that if you 're going to <unk> in this way , they create a <unk> version that 's <unk> <unk> .
We use the great <unk> of evidence and <unk> , which can <unk> <unk> .
But if you were to <unk> , we 'll call " <unk> , " <unk> " <unk> " . "
What does that mean ?
This <unk> , the <unk> , has <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , which <unk> <unk> in the forest , and our eyes <unk> in the same species .
If you <unk> their <unk> <unk> , they would tell us , " <unk> <unk> " <unk> <unk> " <unk> " <unk> " <unk> . "
The solution is : they take the <unk> <unk> <unk> in a night <unk> <unk> with a different <unk> .
And with that you don 't <unk> <unk> , but it 's much more interesting than <unk> <unk> .
Now , [ <unk> ] the problem is that the ones of us who have <unk> <unk> <unk> them , but somehow <unk> to the <unk> of history of respect to our real world , and <unk> <unk> .
In fact , the <unk> century , 300 years , not <unk> <unk> for its <unk> or its <unk> <unk> <unk> , but rather as the one that we 've been <unk> and <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> the mass <unk> of diversity and <unk> and <unk> <unk> of the planet . Now the problem is not the change .
All <unk> through the <unk> have been <unk> in a new <unk> of life .
And the problem is not technology .
<unk> <unk> have no <unk> to be <unk> when they put <unk> and <unk> <unk> as the <unk> have no <unk> to be <unk> when they <unk> have <unk> and <unk> .
It 's not the change or technology that <unk> the <unk> of <unk> . It 's power .
The <unk> <unk> of <unk> .
And if you look at the <unk> , you 'll see that these are not <unk> <unk> .
They 're <unk> creatures and <unk> <unk> out of existence by <unk> forces that go beyond their <unk> <unk> .
<unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> --
a <unk> <unk> of <unk> , in <unk> <unk> , a <unk> that has lived in the forest to a generation of <unk> to a generation <unk> , and now <unk> to the <unk> and the <unk> on the <unk> of the <unk> , which <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , where you can see the <unk> <unk> <unk> , where the <unk> <unk> <unk> , where the <unk> <unk> <unk> ,
We 're going to <unk> the <unk> with the <unk> <unk> to the forest .
Or , in the case of <unk> , are the diseases that are <unk> with the discovery of <unk> .
If you 're going to <unk> on the <unk> of the <unk> , where I 'm doing a lot of research , you 'll see the <unk> of the political <unk> .
As a <unk> <unk> , the physics of a <unk> , is <unk> at the <unk> level , but the <unk> , the <unk> of <unk> 's life of a <unk> , not only is <unk> , but <unk> <unk> in certain <unk> , because it 's part of the development .
And you can 't understand the <unk> of the <unk> until you start from the beginning .
I <unk> <unk> miles from <unk> in China through the <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> with a young <unk> , but only <unk> <unk> to <unk> , I realized what the <unk> behind .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> million people <unk> from the <unk> during the <unk> <unk> .
The father of this guy was <unk> at the <unk> <unk> .
which means that it was <unk> at the time of Chinese <unk> .
<unk> <unk> is <unk> with <unk> <unk> during the <unk> that he brought the <unk> in <unk> .
My mother was <unk> and his <unk> was <unk> .
It 's taken of <unk> in <unk> at age of two <unk> years of his <unk> , because he couldn 't have live without him .
The <unk> , which has done the same , was <unk> in <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> , and for this <unk> , was <unk> to <unk> jobs for seven years .
The pain of <unk> can be <unk> , but the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> is <unk> present .
<unk> , all of course , they 're <unk> to a choice .
<unk> live in the <unk> world of <unk> or want to <unk> the world of diversity ?
The great <unk> <unk> <unk> , before you die of death , who was <unk> fear was that , in our going to this <unk> <unk> view of the world 's imagination , not only <unk> the entire <unk> of human imagination to a <unk> of human imagination , but a day we <unk> <unk> that there were other possibilities .
And it 's <unk> to remember that our species is <unk> for <unk> years .
The <unk> <unk> , who gave us the agriculture , which he did <unk> us to the <unk> of the <unk> with the <unk> of the <unk> with the <unk> of the <unk> , creating the <unk> of the <unk> , and we talk about <unk> years ago .
The <unk> world has <unk> 300 years old .
That <unk> story , I don 't know that we have the answers to all the challenges that we 're going to <unk> in <unk> .
When these <unk> <unk> of the world is asked what it means to be human , <unk> with <unk> different <unk> .
And it 's in these answers that we all <unk> the chance of being what we are , a <unk> species , which has to <unk> the <unk> and all the <unk> can <unk> . And there are big moments of <unk> .
I <unk> this picture on the north of <unk> , when I went to <unk> <unk> with <unk> , and this man , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> the wonderful story of his <unk> .
The <unk> government wasn 't always <unk> with the <unk> <unk> and in the <unk> for the <unk> <unk> , and we <unk> it in <unk> .
The <unk> of this man <unk> <unk> .
The family , <unk> for his life , the <unk> away all of his <unk> , and all of his <unk> .
You want to know that <unk> don 't <unk> the cold , <unk> it .
The <unk> <unk> <unk> were made of <unk> fish <unk> in <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> of this man didn 't <unk> out of the <unk> <unk> or <unk> .
It 's <unk> away , it <unk> the <unk> <unk> in his hand . When I did it , they <unk> it , it <unk> it up , it <unk> it into it .
He <unk> <unk> on the <unk> of this <unk> of <unk> and when <unk> <unk> , he <unk> a dog .
He <unk> the dog and created a <unk> , with the <unk> <unk> has created a <unk> , he <unk> another dog , and he 's <unk> on the <unk> , <unk> <unk> in <unk> .
You want to talk about <unk> ? <unk> . And that in different ways , [ <unk> ] [ <unk> ] and all the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> and all the <unk> <unk> of the world .
<unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> government <unk> to the <unk> control of a larger area of California and <unk> <unk> together .
It 's their new <unk> . It 's called <unk> .
It 's a <unk> <unk> . It 's all the <unk> resources .
One <unk> example of how a <unk> can <unk> with his <unk> .
And , finally , I think it 's pretty <unk> at least who are in these <unk> <unk> of the planet , that they realize that they 're not not <unk> at all .
For someone is home .
<unk> <unk> of the human imagination that <unk> to the <unk> of the time . And for all of us , the dreams of these children , as the dreams of our children , become part of the <unk> hope .
<unk> , we <unk> <unk> <unk> , we <unk> <unk> that <unk> never <unk> to anything .
I would say that the <unk> --
<unk> are not <unk> , but we believe that stories can change the world , and maybe we are the best for stories of the world . Every month our website , <unk> <unk> million <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> our <unk> <unk> .
Our <unk> are <unk> by millions of people .
Our work is <unk> in the <unk> to bring our public <unk> in places of <unk> <unk> that they were <unk> by how they saw and , <unk> , <unk> for the <unk> of <unk> : the world <unk> of <unk> diversity , and we have to find a <unk> of life in a <unk> world and <unk> .
where the <unk> of all the <unk> can <unk> to our <unk> <unk> .
Thank you .
I 'm going to talk about some things that I wrote in this book that I hope to <unk> other you 've heard and <unk> to <unk> some <unk> , in the case you don 't know .
I want to start with what I call " the <unk> <unk> . "
The <unk> <unk> of what ?
The <unk> <unk> of all <unk> society will be <unk> . The <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> : " If we want to <unk> the <unk> of our citizens . " The way to do it is to <unk> the <unk> . "
The reason is , on one hand , in the fact that it is <unk> , it 's <unk> , it 's <unk> , <unk> for human beings .
On the other one is that if we are <unk> , each of us can act to do for all of what we <unk> our <unk> , without any <unk> that we 're going to have to do everything that we <unk> our <unk> .
The way to <unk> the freedom is to <unk> the choice .
More choices people , more <unk> are <unk> , and more <unk> is their <unk> , the freedom , the <unk> is their <unk> .
This is , <unk> , <unk> , that nobody <unk> to <unk> <unk> in the society .
And it 's also <unk> <unk> in our lives .
I 'm going to show you some examples of what progress has made possible .
This is my <unk> . It 's not particularly big .
I <unk> a simple note on the <unk> to <unk> .
In my <unk> , there are <unk> <unk> , without <unk> the 10 <unk> of <unk> <unk> and the 12 <unk> <unk> that you can buy a huge number of <unk> in the <unk> that no one of the <unk> <unk> , which nobody of the <unk> <unk> is already <unk> .
Here 's what the <unk> is .
Then you go to the <unk> store <unk> for buy a <unk> : <unk> , radio , radio <unk> , <unk> , radio , <unk> , <unk> .
And in this single <unk> store , there 's a big number of <unk> <unk> .
We can make six and a half million different <unk> using the <unk> that there are in one store .
<unk> <unk> that there is <unk> choice .
<unk> <unk> : the world of <unk> .
Once , when I was a kid , they could get all the services <unk> , <unk> <unk> that they were <unk> by <unk> <unk> .
You <unk> the phone , you don 't <unk> it .
A <unk> of that , by the way , was that the phone did not <unk> .
These days they went .
We have a <unk> <unk> of <unk> , especially between cell phones .
Here 's cell phones .
My <unk> is in the middle , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , and <unk> for the <unk> <unk> .
If you don 't still have seen in the store below the house , you 're well <unk> .
And what happens is that people <unk> in the <unk> and <unk> this question . And you know what the answer is , " No . "
You can 't buy a cell phone that doesn 't face <unk> things .
So , in other <unk> of life that are much more important than <unk> , <unk> the same <unk> of choices .
<unk> <unk> : <unk> is not going on in the United States that you 're going to be <unk> by <unk> and the <unk> <unk> you what you have to do .
Instead , you get out of the <unk> , and the <unk> says , " OK , could be able to do A , or <unk> , " he 's " <unk> , " has these <unk> and these <unk> . What do you want to do ? "
You were <unk> , " <unk> , what do you want to do ? "
And the <unk> says , " <unk> , " <unk> , " <unk> , " <unk> , "
" What do you want to do ? "
And you say , " <unk> if you were me , what would you like me ? "
And the <unk> : " But I 'm not her . "
We call the " <unk> <unk> <unk> , " <unk> " <unk> " , " <unk> " <unk> " , " <unk> " <unk> " . "
But it 's not that a <unk> the weight and the responsibility of <unk> to someone who knows something , <unk> the <unk> , <unk> , to <unk> that <unk> , to somebody else that doesn 't know -- and it 's certainly <unk> -- and so not in the <unk> to make decisions about their patient ,
There 's a huge <unk> of <unk> products , <unk> to people like me and you , that if you think about it doesn 't make any sense , because we can 't <unk> .
But if we can 't <unk> , why can we get them ?
The answer is that they want to <unk> that we call the <unk> <unk> to <unk> the <unk> .
<unk> of <unk> as a fundamental way is our <unk> now is a choice , as you see in this <unk> . " We don 't want to <unk> the kids . <unk> their sex at the right time . " Don 't <unk> any <unk> . We 're not going to be <unk> .
And we can <unk> how many times we <unk> .
which means that every <unk> , <unk> , you have to decide that kind of person you want to be .
And I went to the family and <unk> , a common perspective , almost for anyone , was that <unk> as soon as possible , and you <unk> to <unk> the <unk> as soon as possible .
The only real choice was with who , not when , and they don 't even what to do next .
<unk> , it 's really to play .
They are very smart students , and they <unk> 20 percent <unk> than a time .
And because they 're not <unk> <unk> , because they 're not <unk> .
but why they are <unk> , they 're <unk> , " <unk> <unk> or not ? "
" <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> ? I have to think about kids or career ? "
They 're <unk> <unk> .
And they try to answer those questions , even if this <unk> is not <unk> the <unk> that we 're going to <unk> and not get a nice <unk> to my <unk> .
And they really have to do that . They 're important questions .
Now , the work : we 're <unk> , as <unk> <unk> , because technology <unk> us to work every minute , every day , from every day , on the planet , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , there is a <unk> , and I 'm not going to say , what the <unk> works .
I don 't tell you , because I want to use it .
What it means , this incredible <unk> of choice that we have about the work ? It 's that we have to decide , <unk> at any time , if we have to work or not .
We can go to see our son to play <unk> , with the cell phone in one <unk> , the <unk> in the other , and the <unk> , <unk> .
And even though they are all <unk> , every minute that we see our son , we 're also <unk> , " I have to answer this call ? "
" I have to answer this <unk> ? I have to <unk> this letter ? "
And even when the answer is , " no , " that makes the experience of your son very different than what would be in other conditions .
So , any part of them , small things , small and big things , materials and <unk> , life is a question of choices .
Once the world was this : <unk> , there was some possibilities , but it was not a question of choice .
The world of today are going to this : " Is <unk> <unk> , " Is it a <unk> thing , or <unk> ? "
The answer is <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> we all know , so I 'm going to talk about the <unk> ones .
<unk> this choice <unk> two effects effects effects of people .
The first , <unk> , is that it <unk> <unk> rather than <unk> .
With a lot of <unk> between which <unk> , it becomes very difficult to do .
I 'll give you an example of a <unk> <unk> : a study <unk> <unk> <unk> .
A <unk> of my <unk> has <unk> access to the <unk> data , the <unk> society , with about a million <unk> <unk> in different companies .
What she found is that for every 10 <unk> that are <unk> , the <unk> of <unk> <unk> two percent .
With 50 <unk> <unk> , there 's 10 percent less than <unk> when you 're available . Why ?
Because with 50 <unk> <unk> between which <unk> , is <unk> difficult to decide , and the choice is <unk> to the <unk> .
And in <unk> , and again , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and of course <unk> <unk> never comes .
<unk> that it doesn 't mean that just it doesn 't mean that the decision is <unk> , because they don 't have enough money , it also wants to say that the decision is so <unk> that it also <unk> the <unk> <unk> of work .
They 're not <unk> , they 're <unk> up to five <unk> per year from the <unk> of work , which would be well <unk> to <unk> .
So <unk> is a <unk> of having <unk> choices .
And I think we 're going to <unk> the world like this .
" And finally , to end the <unk> : <unk> , <unk> or <unk> ? "
You 're going to be the right decision , if it 's for the <unk> , right ?
You don 't want to choose the wrong <unk> , and you get the wrong <unk> .
So this is the first effect . The second one is that even if we can <unk> the <unk> and make choice , finally , we 're <unk> by the end of how <unk> they 're <unk> with less <unk> between which <unk> .
And that 's why .
One of them is that with a lot of <unk> between you choose , if you take one and it 's not perfect , it 's easy to imagine that they could make a different choice that would be better . And what happens is that the <unk> <unk> us to <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> <unk> by <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> by <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> <unk> by <unk> ,
even when it was a <unk> decision .
<unk> more choices there are , easier is to <unk> than any <unk> that <unk> is <unk> of <unk> choice .
<unk> , there 's what <unk> call .
<unk> has <unk> very well as the value of <unk> things that we <unk> things that we <unk> with .
<unk> rest , when you have a lot of <unk> possible , it 's easy to <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> and be less <unk> than the <unk> that 's <unk> .
Here is an example . I 'm <unk> with all the ones that are not in New York .
But that 's probably <unk> .
There 's this <unk> to the <unk> .
A place of <unk> .
<unk> <unk> . <unk> day . It 's all for them .
I 'm not going to talk about it . But what he thinks is , " Well , <unk> . "
" All my <unk> <unk> are away . "
" <unk> <unk> <unk> right in front of the house . "
And it <unk> two weeks from the idea that 's going to <unk> -- every day -- the chance of <unk> where it wants .
The <unk> <unk> the <unk> for what we have , even when the choice was <unk> .
And the most of the <unk> we 've been <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> ,
Here 's another example .
This <unk> tells us a lot of things .
It 's about living the time , and maybe a living living in slowly .
But the most important point is that anything you 're going to , you 're going to <unk> .
The things that don 't <unk> have a lot of <unk> that can make less <unk> what we do .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> <unk> .
I tried it on my skin <unk> a new couple of <unk> .
It almost always <unk> .
And once the <unk> were in one , they <unk> them and <unk> by <unk> , they were <unk> , only after <unk> a life <unk> and <unk> a lot of times , and they would go well .
So , I started to <unk> a new couple when the <unk> had gone , and I said , " I need a couple of <unk> , this is my <unk> . "
The <unk> said , " <unk> does <unk> want to <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> ? "
They want them to <unk> or <unk> ? " <unk> " or " <unk> " ? "
" <unk> wants them to <unk> ? "
" <unk> wants to <unk> or <unk> ? <unk> <unk> <unk> -- " <unk> <unk> .
I was <unk> , and after a little bit of <unk> to say , " I want the guy that was the only guy , " he had no idea what it was , so for a time , I <unk> all of the <unk> <unk> <unk> , and then <unk> from the store , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk>
It was the <unk> . With all that choice , I had <unk> the best .
But I 'm going to get worse .
Why ? I wrote a whole book to <unk> .
And the reason I was worse is that with all that choice my <unk> were <unk> , the <unk> <unk> to be <unk> .
I had <unk> <unk> . I didn 't <unk> anything <unk> when I was <unk> , just a guy when I was <unk> 100 different , and then you know , at least one , you had to be perfect .
What I had <unk> was good , but not perfect .
After <unk> the one of the <unk> I was <unk> in <unk> to <unk> .
The <unk> of <unk> in the life of people do not make the <unk> that these <unk> have respect to the <unk> of the <unk> themselves .
And that 's <unk> <unk> , even when the results are good .
<unk> in the world of the <unk> is <unk> .
Because if you <unk> it , I 'm not going to talk about what I 'm talking about .
The truth is more than that .
" You know when you were worse , " because it was worse when it was <unk> as much as it was <unk> as much as it was <unk> as much as you can <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> , in the world that we live in -- <unk> , <unk> <unk> with the <unk> of <unk> -- the <unk> that we can <unk> is that the things are at the <unk> .
You 've never never <unk> <unk> because your <unk> , my <unk> , <unk> are <unk> .
The <unk> of happiness -- what you 're here -- is , " <unk> <unk> " Yes , " you want to . "
I mean , little <unk> moment -- that I 'm really <unk> and my wife is really <unk> .
I couldn 't do better , I didn 't <unk> .
But <unk> doesn 't always <unk> .
<unk> , a <unk> of <unk> <unk> when there is only that kind of <unk> is that when you 're not <unk> , and you say , " Why ? "
" Who is <unk> ? " <unk> is <unk> . "
The world is <unk> . What could I do it ?
When you have hundreds of <unk> <unk> , and you get one <unk> , and you 're going to have one <unk> , and you 're <unk> who is <unk> , it 's clear that you 're .
We could have done better .
With hundreds of <unk> <unk> , there are no <unk> for <unk> .
So when people make decisions , even if the <unk> is <unk> , they <unk> and give their own <unk> .
In the last years , the <unk> is <unk> in the <unk> world .
I think a <unk> <unk> -- not the only , but important -- of this <unk> of <unk> is that people have <unk> experiences because the standard is too <unk> .
And when they have to <unk> that they think <unk> is them .
So the final result is that we 're better , <unk> , but we 're going to get worse .
Let me show you .
This is the <unk> <unk> , what we all take for good and is completely <unk> . It 's not true .
There is no <unk> that a little bit of choice is better than <unk> at all , but this doesn 't want a lot of choice is better than a little bit .
There is a <unk> , <unk> . I don 't know what it is .
But I 'm quite sure we 've <unk> from a piece of the level that the choices will make life .
Now , from a <unk> point -- I 've been <unk> -- from a <unk> point of view , the <unk> is the <unk> .
What it allows all this choice in the <unk> society is the <unk> material .
There are many places in the world , and you know , <unk> <unk> , where the problem is not that they have <unk> choice .
The problem is they have too <unk> .
So the <unk> I 'm talking about is a <unk> <unk> of <unk> , <unk> society .
And what <unk> does <unk> and <unk> is this : <unk> <unk> <unk> talked to you yesterday about how the <unk> and <unk> <unk> to <unk> are <unk> . It 's a <unk> of money .
I mean that these choices , <unk> and <unk> , is not just <unk> .
They 're <unk> <unk> .
They make us worse .
If a little bit of what in our society <unk> <unk> to be <unk> in those where people have too few people , it wouldn 't be just a life to <unk> <unk> , but our .
This is what <unk> call a <unk> <unk> .
A <unk> of income does well for everyone -- not just the poor -- because of this choice in <unk> that we 're <unk> .
So , I said , " <unk> , you can get all you want to --
<unk> , people of culture , <unk> : " What 's going to do ? "
" It 's <unk> that you can 't make anything in a glass <unk> . "
" A <unk> <unk> imagination , a <unk> view of the world --
and I <unk> it like this , at the beginning .
But then , <unk> , instead , I realized that that that fish knows it long .
Because the reality of the fact of the things that if you <unk> the <unk> , so that " everything is possible , " you can 't <unk> the <unk> . You <unk> the <unk> .
If you <unk> the <unk> <unk> so that everything could <unk> possible to <unk> the <unk> .
<unk> the <unk> , and they <unk> the <unk> .
Everybody needs a <unk> .
This is almost certainly too <unk> , maybe even for the fish , and it 's <unk> for us .
But the <unk> of some <unk> <unk> is a <unk> for <unk> and , <unk> , for <unk> .
Thank you very much .
