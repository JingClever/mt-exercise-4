<unk> year I showed these <unk> to <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> , which for almost three million years has had the size of the United States , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> 40 percent .
So , I 'm going to <unk> the <unk> of the problem because it doesn 't show the ice <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> is , in a sense , the heart of the climate system .
It <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
The next <unk> is going to be a <unk> <unk> on the last 25 years .
<unk> <unk> are red in red .
You see , you see , you 'll see , you 'll see , you 'll see , you 'll see , you 'll see , you see , you 'll see , you can see , you <unk> it up to the blue <unk> .
That 's the ice in <unk> , which <unk> summer .
You can see that the <unk> ice , of five years or more , it 's like the blood , which here is <unk> by the body .
In 25 years , it 's been <unk> .
This is a problem because the <unk> <unk> are interested in the ocean <unk> around the ocean , where there are enormous <unk> of <unk> that , <unk> , are <unk> in <unk> .
<unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> , that <unk> could <unk> , that <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> this <unk> <unk> .
In some <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> , the <unk> is already <unk> by water .
The <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> ! <unk> : She 's good . <unk> : She 's good . The question is if we <unk> it .
A reason is that this <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> from the north .
This is a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> had never <unk> <unk> <unk> .
This is the <unk> river , in the <unk> of <unk> .
If you want to know how the <unk> <unk> <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> on the <unk> , here is where the sea .
These <unk> are <unk> <unk> .
On the other part of the planet : <unk> , the largest <unk> ice on the planet .
<unk> month , the <unk> scientists have <unk> that the <unk> of the ice is in <unk> , and that <unk> <unk> on some <unk> <unk> , is particularly <unk> in the <unk> .
<unk> at six feet of the <unk> , like in <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> of ice , you see new <unk> , which few years ago were <unk> .
<unk> 40 percent of the world population <unk> water from that <unk> .
<unk> <unk> : This <unk> is the source of water water <unk> of this city .
<unk> is <unk> .
But when you <unk> , the same happens to the water .
In California , <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> is 40 percent .
<unk> <unk> are in crisis .
<unk> , as you read , are <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> in the world <unk> to a <unk> increase in <unk> .
<unk> <unk> are <unk> to a <unk> outside normal and without <unk> .
<unk> times more <unk> in the last 30 years than <unk> <unk> .
This is a <unk> of <unk> .
If you look at it in the context of it can see the <unk> .
In the last five years we have <unk> 70 million <unk> of CO2 <unk> every 24 hours -- 25 million <unk> in the ocean every day .
Look at the <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and both of the <unk> <unk> , where there is a <unk> <unk> of oxygen in the ocean .
The <unk> cause of global warming , together to <unk> , which is 20 percent , is the use of <unk> <unk> .
<unk> is a problem , and <unk> is even worse .
The United States is one of the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , together to China .
And it 's <unk> to build a lot of other <unk> <unk> .
But we 're <unk> to a <unk> of direction .
These are the <unk> projects in the last few years and some of the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> , there is a political <unk> in our country .
<unk> <unk> and oil <unk> have <unk> million dollars in the last year to <unk> the <unk> <unk> , which is a <unk> .
I 'm going to give you something --
<unk> <unk> , in <unk> , where I live , there was a <unk> of <unk> billion <unk> <unk> .
Maybe you 've seen it on <unk> .
This is the second largest flow of <unk> in America .
It 's happened around <unk> .
<unk> <unk> of one of the <unk> <unk> was this .
<unk> : <unk> ♫ ♫ <unk> the <unk> is a <unk> and happy .
It 's <unk> here in America , and it <unk> our economy .
<unk> the <unk> is <unk> <unk> .
It 's at good price , <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The largest <unk> society on the <unk> is <unk> . This is his <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> -- <unk> <unk> -- Al <unk> , <unk> <unk> -- not know what they 're talking about .
<unk> : So the <unk> for <unk> <unk> has <unk> two <unk> .
This is one of them , a part .
<unk> : <unk> : <unk> <unk> , we see the climate change as a <unk> <unk> to our business .
So , our <unk> is a great amount of money in a <unk> <unk> to make public and <unk> the truth on <unk> .
In fact , <unk> is not <unk> .
We think it 's <unk> -- it 's also a good <unk> .
So we don 't know about climate change .
We need to do .
<unk> : <unk> : <unk> <unk> -- you 've heard about it very much .
So we 're going to take a <unk> structure in a <unk> , as it 's about <unk> .
<unk> ! <unk> ! <unk> are a little <unk> , but this is the sound of technology <unk> .
<unk> <unk> is between the major <unk> of global <unk> , but the <unk> technology technology that you see changes everything .
Let 's look : this is the <unk> technology of <unk> <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to the economic <unk> and the national security .
<unk> : <unk> : America is in the crisis ; the national security , the <unk> , the crisis .
The <unk> that <unk> all : our <unk> <unk> from <unk> , like <unk> and oil <unk> .
Now , there 's a new <unk> , <unk> solution to <unk> .
<unk> America : 100 percent of energy <unk> , in 10 years .
A plan to <unk> America at work , more <unk> , and help more <unk> , and help help <unk> global warming .
<unk> , a solution that we 're going to solve our problems .
<unk> America . <unk> more .
<unk> : This is the last one .
<unk> : It 's <unk> : <unk> energy to America .
One of the most <unk> ways of <unk> to <unk> from <unk> that <unk> our planet .
<unk> : The future is here . <unk> , <unk> , a new network <unk> .
<unk> <unk> two : <unk> <unk> for work .
<unk> : <unk> America . It 's time to be <unk> .
<unk> : A old <unk> <unk> says , " If you want to go <unk> , go alone .
If you want to go far , you go to it . "
We have to go far , quickly .
Thank you very much .
<unk> year I did a <unk> on <unk> .
And we try to <unk> them to <unk> on how the machine works .
So , we <unk> . And for those that the other time there were no , the <unk> is the largest scientific experiment ever <unk> -- <unk> miles of <unk> .
His task is to <unk> the conditions that were in less than a <unk> of the second of the universe -- until <unk> million times a second .
All of that is simply <unk> .
This is the car under <unk> .
So , you know , you know , you know , you can see these <unk> <unk> .
This is what I work . It 's called <unk> -- it 's <unk> feet and it has a <unk> <unk> .
This is a <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> , so you can see the <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> last year we 've <unk> the machine for the first time .
And this picture was <unk> by <unk> .
It was <unk> <unk> in control .
It 's an image of the first <unk> of particles that had done all the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , with a part of the <unk> , and we look inside the <unk> .
In other words , when you <unk> the image 10 <unk> , I <unk> that the car <unk> , which is a great <unk> .
I don 't know if it was this to <unk> us more or this , when somebody <unk> on Google and you <unk> that the page was this .
That means we 've had a <unk> impact over to that scientific one .
<unk> a week later , there was a problem with the machine , had to just this <unk> <unk> here -- these <unk> <unk> .
These <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> when the car works at the <unk> of <unk> .
Now , the <unk> between you <unk> and <unk> , " It 's not true . They 're too <unk> . "
And they can do it because when they 're very <unk> <unk> <unk> .
So , unless you get <unk> degrees , at a temperature <unk> to that <unk> of the space between stars , these <unk> can bring that <unk> .
In one of the <unk> between the most of <unk> <unk> in the <unk> , there was a <unk> <unk> .
So the <unk> <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> .
This was the result .
Now , this is even <unk> if you think that these <unk> <unk> more than 20 <unk> , and that you have about 30 <unk> .
They have about 50 <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , what we did .
We have <unk> and <unk> .
Now they 're all <unk> to their <unk> place .
<unk> the end of <unk> <unk> is going to be again .
We <unk> it , and we <unk> to get data to <unk> or <unk> , and so on our <unk> to find out what the <unk> are the <unk> that we <unk> the universe .
Now , of course , in some ways , these <unk> <unk> <unk> the value of science and engineering engineering <unk> . It 's easy to <unk> .
I think the fact that it 's so hard , the fact that it 's the value of things like <unk> .
I 'd like to end with the words of a <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , which , in <unk> <unk> of the <unk> experiments of his <unk> , his <unk> was Michael <unk> , said , " It 's no <unk> for the progress of human mind than the ideas of science are <unk> , which we don 't have to <unk> in nature , that we don 't have <unk> in nature , and that we don 't have new <unk> . "
Thank you .
I want to start <unk> to when , as children , <unk> , <unk> with <unk> .
<unk> <unk> how we <unk> and <unk> and <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , actually , <unk> , to think and <unk> problems and <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> is <unk> <unk> to the way we <unk> in the world around us .
So , from <unk> <unk> from <unk> of our <unk> with objects , and my <unk> <unk> , and my <unk> <unk> <unk> , I started <unk> , I started <unk> , I started <unk> , I started <unk> , " And if we use a computer , you could have the <unk> <unk> <unk> as a digital <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> with a <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> with <unk> ,
and <unk> to our <unk> ?
The question was so interesting that we wanted to explore the answer , building the <unk> .
In a few words , a <unk> is a <unk> computer as a <unk> .
In a few words , a <unk> is a <unk> computer as a <unk> .
You can <unk> them with your hand , they can <unk> them , feel like , you can hear their <unk> , and they have a <unk> radio .
But <unk> , they 're <unk> objects , like <unk> , you can just <unk> .
<unk> are the example of a new <unk> of tools to <unk> the digital information .
And as they become more <unk> , <unk> of the <unk> , of the other , and <unk> , and <unk> of the <unk> , <unk> of the other , of how we can explore and <unk> new <unk> <unk> .
I 'll just just just <unk> .
This <unk> is <unk> to show you about video : if you <unk> it in a direction , the video <unk> , if you go to the other <unk> back .
These <unk> <unk> are <unk> of others .
If you <unk> them , you 're <unk> to what they around .
If they come <unk> , and they can <unk> it a little bit .
If they come <unk> , and they can <unk> it a little bit .
They also have their movement and <unk> .
And we <unk> that one of the interesting <unk> of <unk> was the <unk> that we could use common <unk> on the data , which is a color .
In this case , we have three <unk> <unk> <unk> like <unk> of <unk> and I can <unk> to <unk> the <unk> of the color in the central one , where you 're <unk> .
and I can <unk> to <unk> the color in the central one , where you <unk> .
If you get too , we can <unk> a little bit to be <unk> .
There are also <unk> <unk> <unk> , like <unk> , mathematics and games where people can try things things , and <unk> things that quickly , and <unk> the results immediately .
I 'm --
This is a <unk> sequence I do with a <unk> <unk> program .
Here we have a <unk> of words that is half between <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> , at every <unk> <unk> a letter to <unk> on every <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , every <unk> , and <unk> a letter on every <unk> , and while I <unk> <unk> <unk> in him , and as I was <unk> <unk> , he <unk> on a <unk> .
Then , after about 30 seconds , and you have a new <unk> of <unk> and new <unk> , and new <unk> to try .
Thank you .
Here are <unk> children in <unk> <unk> <unk> , I made it so I <unk> them and I <unk> a video .
They 're very <unk> very <unk> .
And one of the interesting things of <unk> is that you don 't have to give people many <unk> of them .
I just say , " <unk> of words , " and they know exactly what to do .
Here 's other people who <unk> it .
This is our <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , there on the right .
It just wanted to <unk> .
They were just <unk> , for him .
Now , this is a <unk> of a <unk> <unk> .
It 's going to build a tool for the <unk> of <unk> . He 's <unk> .
It can <unk> new characters in the scene , <unk> their <unk> .
It can <unk> new characters in the scene , <unk> their <unk> .
Here 's , it 's going to get out the sun .
<unk> : The sun is <unk> .
David <unk> : Now he brought a <unk> in the scene .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> .
<unk> work ! Yeah !
So we <unk> the <unk> and <unk> can <unk> the characters --
<unk> : <unk> !
-- I 'll <unk> their story .
<unk> : <unk> !
<unk> : It 's a story with open , and you can decide how you 're <unk> .
<unk> : It 's a story with open , and you can decide how you 're <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> away , <unk> .
<unk> : The last example I have time to show you is a tool , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> music .
It 's a recently tool , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> music .
The <unk> here are <unk> by <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> of these have four different <unk> , and you can choose which you can use .
You can also <unk> these <unk> in a <unk> sequence to your <unk> .
And you just <unk> by doing a " sound and a sequence . "
These are actually , you can <unk> live , like <unk> and <unk> .
I 'll start to a particular sound and then you <unk> it .
And then there are the effects of <unk> as long and <unk> , which <unk> the whole sequence .
<unk> how it works .
<unk> : <unk> : <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> , " <unk> in a series , " <unk> in a series , the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> in a
Now , let 's take a <unk> line .
<unk> : <unk> : Now , <unk> <unk> <unk> --
<unk> : And now I 'm going to <unk> the <unk> , so I can control the effect of the alive .
<unk> : I can <unk> the whole sequence of time on one side or another .
<unk> : And now we 're going to <unk> the <unk> <unk> to give more <unk> .
<unk> : I can <unk> the sequence of <unk> .
So I don 't have to <unk> before , but I can <unk> , <unk> more or more <unk> .
And now , finally , I can <unk> the whole <unk> <unk> <unk> on the left the <unk> " <unk> . "
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is to build new <unk> and more <unk> and more <unk> to how our brain work and body .
And today , I had time to show you one of this <unk> , and some <unk> that we 're trying to bring out of the lab .
The concept I want to <unk> is that 's going to <unk> this new generation of objects to <unk> the media , which <unk> information in our world in the way we want .
Thank you very much .
I don 't see the time I 'm not seeing a lot of you .
I 'm a <unk> .
<unk> books is my <unk> , but it 's more than that , of course .
It 's also love and <unk> of my life .
And I don 't look like that it can change .
But , I said this , something that was happened in my life and my career , which led me to <unk> the whole relationship with this work .
The particular thing is I <unk> wrote this book , this <unk> called " <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
And the result is that everywhere I 'm <unk> now , people <unk> me as if I was <unk> .
<unk> -- <unk> , <unk> !
I 'm going to go to me now and they say , " You don 't fear of being able to be able to do better ?
You don 't fear to keep writing for all life that we could be able to create a book that could <unk> to somebody ? "
<unk> that can <unk> to somebody ? "
It 's <unk> , you know .
But it could go worse , <unk> that I remember over 20 years ago , when I was <unk> to say people -- I was a <unk> -- I wanted to be a <unk> .
I 'm going to talk to the <unk> <unk> .
And people say , " Don 't you know , you don 't know to be successful ?
You don 't fear that <unk> <unk> ?
You don 't fear to do this <unk> for all life without anything that is going to be out and die on a <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> ? "
So , you know .
The answer -- the short answer to all these questions is , " Yeah . "
Yeah , I fear of all those things .
I 've always had fear .
And I 'm afraid of many other things that people couldn 't <unk> .
As the <unk> and other things that are <unk> .
But , as I thought , what I thought and I was <unk> to me is why ?
Is it <unk> ?
It 's <unk> that anyone who who <unk> <unk> to be <unk> by a job that you feel born to do .
But what about this particular <unk> <unk> by <unk> <unk> <unk> about health <unk> <unk> in a way that other <unk> don 't do ?
As my father , for example , he was a <unk> <unk> and I don 't remember one time in his 40 years of activity where he was asked if she was <unk> to be <unk> ?
It was never -- that <unk> of <unk> John , how is it ?
<unk> 't that way , <unk> ?
<unk> , engineers <unk> as a group of certainly <unk> , <unk> , <unk> the <unk> of being <unk> <unk> <unk> .
We <unk> , we have enough this <unk> , and not only <unk> but <unk> of all that , we have this <unk> to be <unk> <unk> .
And then , you know , you look at the <unk> of the dead <unk> <unk> that only in the <unk> century , <unk> young and often to them .
And the ones that don 't have <unk> to be really <unk> by their <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , before I died , in <unk> , <unk> said , " Every book my book <unk> me a little <unk> of " <unk> <unk> about the work of their life .
But we don 't know when we say , because we heard these things so long that somehow we have <unk> and <unk> the <unk> that creativity and <unk> are in some <unk> way that creativity and <unk> are in some <unk> way that art , at the end , we 'll always get to <unk> .
And the question I want to <unk> to all here is : are you agree with this idea ?
It 's good to you this thing -- because I also <unk> from a <unk> distance to me , I 'm not good for this <unk> .
I think it 's <unk> .
And I think it 's also <unk> , and I don 't want to <unk> it in the next century .
I think it 's better to <unk> our great <unk> to live .
And I certainly know , in my <unk> -- it would be very <unk> to start <unk> to the <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> the <unk> where I am I in my career .
<unk> -- look , I 'm pretty young , I 'm <unk> , I have about 40 years .
I still have about four <unk> <unk> of work in me .
And it 's very <unk> that anything you 're going to be <unk> by now in the world , as the work that <unk> after the <unk> of my last book .
<unk> <unk> , because we 're all about , because we 're all -- it 's <unk> that my greatest success is to the <unk> .
Oh , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> !
You know , this is the kind of thought that leads a person to start <unk> <unk> to the nine of the morning and I don 't want to do it .
I 'm going to keep doing this work that I love .
So , the question becomes , how ?
And so , it seems to me , after many <unk> , that the way of working is to write about <unk> <unk> , OK ?
I have to find a <unk> distance between me , which I 'm <unk> , and my natural <unk> on what I 'm <unk> , and my natural <unk> on what we could do do . And as we were to look through time , trying to find some more <unk> ideas to see if we have better ideas and find some ideas and see if we have better ideas and find some ideas and see if we have better ideas and find some of the <unk> ideas and <unk> to do a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
about how to help people <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> of creativity .
And that research led me to the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
<unk> because I went back to <unk> and then we go back .
<unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> -- people don 't believe that creativity <unk> from men , OK ?
It <unk> that creativity was this <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> to men from some <unk> <unk> and <unk> , for reasons and <unk> and <unk> , for reasons and <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> of these <unk> <unk> <unk> of creativity .
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> to have a <unk> <unk> <unk> from <unk> .
The <unk> were in the same idea , but we <unk> that sort of <unk> <unk> .
And the <unk> is <unk> , because the <unk> didn 't really think that a <unk> was somebody particularly smart .
And I thought that a <unk> was this kind of <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> literally in the <unk> of the study of a artist , a little <unk> like the <unk> <unk> , and that we <unk> out of <unk> the work of the artist and <unk> the result of that work .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> you from the results of which I 'm talking -- that <unk> <unk> <unk> you from the results of your work .
And everybody <unk> that was so that you would say , " Right ?
So the <unk> artists were <unk> by <unk> things , like the too <unk> , right ?
If your work was <unk> , you didn 't have to <unk> the <unk> , everybody <unk> that <unk> state from this <unk> <unk> .
If your work <unk> , it was not all your <unk> , right ?
Everybody <unk> that was your <unk> to be a <unk> .
And so people <unk> <unk> creativity in <unk> for a long time .
Then the <unk> <unk> and all <unk> , and we <unk> this great idea ; we put the human human <unk> on the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk>
This was the <unk> principle of <unk> <unk> and people who were thinking that creativity <unk> <unk> from <unk> .
And for the first time in the story , <unk> to <unk> this or that artist as a rather <unk> that to a person with <unk> .
And I have to <unk> , I think it was a big <unk> .
I think you 're going to be like a <unk> , <unk> person to believe that we 're like a <unk> , <unk> and the <unk> of all the <unk> <unk> , <unk> and <unk> and <unk> is a <unk> responsibility to human <unk> .
It 's like to ask somebody to <unk> the sun .
<unk> and <unk> <unk> all these <unk> <unk> and make all these <unk> <unk> on the <unk> .
And I think it 's been this pressure to have <unk> artists in <unk> 500 years .
And , if this is true , and I think it 's , the question becomes , and now ?
Can we do that ?
<unk> back to a <unk> understanding of the relationship between human and <unk> <unk> .
Or maybe not .
Maybe we can 't <unk> 500 years of thinking in a <unk> <unk> .
And there is probably people in the audience who <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> on the <unk> , <unk> , you do <unk> people <unk> <unk> <unk> on their projects .
You probably don 't tell you all about this thing .
But the question I 'd like to <unk> is -- why ?
Why don 't we <unk> this way ?
Because it has more sense of everything that ever heard to explain the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> process .
A process that , as anyone who ever <unk> to do something -- so , basically , everybody -- know , you don 't <unk> <unk> .
And in fact , it can be completely <unk> .
I 've done this <unk> <unk> with the extraordinary <unk> <unk> , who has now 90 years , but that was a <unk> for the whole life and said that during his <unk> <unk> , <unk> out in the <unk> <unk> , <unk> out in the <unk> <unk> , <unk> out in the <unk> <unk> .
He was like a <unk> <unk> air .
And that <unk> <unk> to her from <unk> .
You <unk> it to get , because he was <unk> the land under his feet .
I decided to have only one thing to do that point and was , by , his <unk> , his <unk> like a <unk> <unk> . "
And so we had to go to home and <unk> it was not going to have to do anything else that take a piece of paper and a <unk> enough <unk> enough to , as the <unk> , <unk> and <unk> on the page .
<unk> times not <unk> to be enough enough , so <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> it without able to get to home and her <unk> and she would <unk> through the <unk> , looking , as she said , " another <unk> . "
Then there were those times -- this piece never <unk> -- there were times when the <unk> was almost <unk> , OK ?
So , he was <unk> at home and <unk> was looking for for the <unk> and the <unk> <unk> through , and then he was <unk> in the while he was <unk> , and then he was like , and then he was like , if he <unk> with the other hand and <unk> .
<unk> the <unk> from the tail and <unk> in his body and the <unk> on the page .
And in these cases , the <unk> would be <unk> on the <unk> page and <unk> , but <unk> <unk> , the <unk> to the first one .
So when you <unk> it -- it 's <unk> , it 's exactly <unk> to my <unk> process .
Not all my <unk> process -- I 'm not a <unk> !
I 'm a <unk> , and my way of <unk> is ; I 'm going to <unk> and work and <unk> and work and <unk> and work and <unk> and <unk> on top .
But even me , in my <unk> , I <unk> against that thing , sometimes .
And I 'll <unk> that many of you <unk> it .
You know , even if the work and the ideas <unk> me <unk> , I could <unk> <unk> .
And what is this thing ?
And how can we <unk> it in a way that we can 't <unk> your head , but rather , what would we <unk> <unk> ?
So , as I 'm <unk> <unk> that I have is the <unk> <unk> <unk> , which I 've been <unk> years ago for a <unk> .
<unk> talking about this , and you know , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , trying to control , <unk> , <unk> these <unk> species of <unk> <unk> .
But then <unk> , he <unk> , and a day while he was <unk> on a <unk> <unk> , <unk> everything for him .
<unk> <unk> , and everything <unk> <unk> , and all of a <unk> <unk> , who comes in his head as a <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , and the <unk> , you know , it 's wonderful , and the <unk> , but not know how to <unk> .
It has no <unk> of paper , it has no <unk> , it has no <unk> .
So you start to hear this sort of <unk> <unk> , <unk> , in him , and I 'm going to lose , and <unk> <unk> <unk> from this song song .
I 'm not enough <unk> , and I can 't <unk> enough . "
And instead of going to be in <unk> , <unk> .
<unk> the whole <unk> process and made something completely new .
I just <unk> the sky and said , " <unk> , don 't you see I 'm <unk> ? "
" It seems to you that a song now ? "
If you really want to <unk> , you 're going to be <unk> when I can <unk> care of you .
<unk> , <unk> to <unk> more <unk> today .
<unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> . "
And his <unk> process after this .
Not the work , the work was still <unk> as always .
But the process , and the <unk> <unk> that <unk> was <unk> when he <unk> the <unk> , the <unk> that he <unk> out of him , he had to be <unk> <unk> back from where , which was not supposed to be a <unk> and <unk> .
but I was <unk> this <unk> , wonderful <unk> <unk> a conversation between <unk> and this thing <unk> and <unk> , but it wasn 't <unk> .
So , how much <unk> that story to change a little bit , even the way I 'm going to be <unk> once .
This idea , I was when I was <unk> , " <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , " and I was in one of the <unk> of the <unk> that we 're all working on something and we can 't think that you 're going to be a <unk> , that 's going to be the <unk> <unk> , that the <unk> would be <unk> , that the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Not just <unk> , just <unk> a book .
And we start thinking about <unk> this project .
But then I 'm going to <unk> me <unk> to be <unk> to the air and I <unk> .
So I <unk> my face on the <unk> and I <unk> my <unk> to a <unk> <unk> of the room .
And I said to <unk> <unk> , " <unk> , what , both we know that if this book is not going to be <unk> my , right ?
Because as you see I 'm <unk> everything I have , I don 't have more than that .
So if you want it to be better , you have to <unk> and do your part .
OK . But if you don 't do that , I 'm not going to be <unk> .
I started writing the same because it 's my work .
And I 'd like you to be <unk> that I 'm <unk> to do my part . " Because , it 's so , OK -- <unk> <unk> does it -- <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> music that <unk> hours until <unk> .
And they were always <unk> , because the <unk> were <unk> and were <unk> .
But every <unk> , <unk> , something <unk> , and one of these <unk> artists actually <unk> .
And I know you know what I 'm talking , because I know you 've all seen , at some point , a <unk> like this .
It was like if time <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> through a kind of <unk> and he wasn 't doing anything different than usually , like <unk> <unk> <unk> before , but it <unk> .
And suddenly , you don 't just like a human .
But it <unk> from <unk> and under the <unk> of <unk> .
And when this <unk> , at the time , people <unk> what was , he <unk> it with her name .
<unk> your hands and <unk> to <unk> , " <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , God , " God . "
That 's God , you know .
<unk> <unk> -- when the <unk> <unk> <unk> , they <unk> the <unk> of <unk> , they <unk> this <unk> with them and the <unk> <unk> in the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , which you can still hear in <unk> or <unk> .
In <unk> , when a artist has done something impossible and <unk> , " <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> -- a <unk> of God .
And it 's <unk> because we need .
But , the problem comes after day , for the <unk> itself , when you <unk> and <unk> that are 11 11 <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> God . There is no more .
It 's simply a great <unk> to <unk> , and maybe never <unk> to that <unk> to that <unk> .
And maybe no one <unk> the name of God still as <unk> , and what 's got to do with his life ?
It 's hard .
This is one of the most <unk> <unk> to do in a <unk> life .
But maybe it doesn 't have to be so <unk> if you don 't believe , <unk> , <unk> , that the most <unk> of your being being being being being being being being <unk> .
But let me just show you that data in <unk> from a source of this <unk> part of this <unk> part of your life that you have to go to <unk> when you finished .
And , you know , if we think it all changes .
And so I started to <unk> , and it 's certainly like I <unk> for several months during the <unk> of the book that I was <unk> soon , the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> of my success .
And what I have to keep <unk> when I feel <unk> from this is , I don 't fear .
Don 't <unk> . You just get your work .
You start to <unk> for your side , whatever it can be .
If your work is <unk> , you 're <unk> .
If the <unk> , you 'll start <unk> to you <unk> <unk> some kind of <unk> , for just a moment through your <unk> , then you go . "
<unk> , you do the same your <unk> .
And " <unk> ! " <unk> you .
I think , and I think it 's <unk> .
" <unk> ! " <unk> you , " even for having had love and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Thank you .
Thank you .
<unk> <unk> : <unk> !
As you know , I 've talked about some of these projects on human genome , about what it can <unk> and the discovery of new genes .
We 're <unk> a new way . We 've started to <unk> biology and now starting from that digital code , we 're <unk> in a new <unk> of biology , <unk> and <unk> and <unk> life .
We 've always tried to ask to ask great questions .
" <unk> is life ? " It 's something that many <unk> , I think they 've got to understand various levels .
We tried different <unk> , <unk> to the <unk> terms .
We 're <unk> for almost 20 years .
When we <unk> the human genome <unk> to go from the <unk> world of biology in the digital world .
Now , let 's tell us : we can <unk> life , or create new life from this digital universe ?
This is a map of a little <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , which is the species from the <unk> genome between those that can <unk> in the lab .
And we tried to reduce <unk> the genome to <unk> a little bit smaller .
We 're able to <unk> a <unk> of genes about 500 than 500 than 500 than 500 than 500 than 500 than that are here .
But when you look at his <unk> map , it 's <unk> simple than our .
<unk> , that 's simple .
But when we look at all the genes that we can <unk> , one at the time , is very <unk> that this can bring to a cell <unk> cell .
So I thought the only way to <unk> was <unk> this <unk> so that we could <unk> the <unk> to <unk> some of these questions .
So we started the <unk> " Can we <unk> a <unk> ? "
Can the chemistry <unk> to produce these great molecules that we 've never been able to create before ?
And , in <unk> , we can make a <unk> ?
A <unk> is simply a <unk> of <unk> material .
The speed with which we 're able to <unk> life is <unk> to <unk> <unk> .
Our ability to write the <unk> code , instead of <unk> , but it 's <unk> .
And our <unk> <unk> <unk> on a <unk> <unk> .
We 've been 15 years ago .
The process has <unk> many <unk> , <unk> with a <unk> <unk> before we <unk> the early experiments .
But we 've discovered that DNA <unk> is very difficult .
There are thousands of cars in the world that <unk> small <unk> of DNA , <unk> <unk> , of 30 to 50 <unk> and it 's a <unk> process : the <unk> is <unk> , more <unk> .
So we had to develop a new <unk> to <unk> these <unk> and <unk> the <unk> .
And this was our first <unk> , <unk> <unk> information of <unk> <unk> <unk> .
It 's a little virus that we can <unk> bacteria .
We designed the <unk> , <unk> the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> a DNA <unk> of about <unk> <unk> .
The interesting part is when we took this piece of <unk> material and we <unk> it in bacteria , the bacteria have <unk> to read this code and <unk> the <unk> particles .
<unk> particles have been <unk> by cells , and have <unk> back and have <unk> <unk> <unk> .
I talked about recently with members of the <unk> industry that they certainly <unk> this model .
They have more than you .
So , let 's think this is a situation where the software can actually build his own <unk> in a <unk> system .
But we could do things more in the big thing .
It 's going to build the whole <unk> of <unk> .
I 'm more than <unk> <unk> <unk> code .
So we thought we 're going to <unk> in <unk> of the virus , so that we can change the <unk> to understand what the <unk> are the <unk> of a <unk> cell .
<unk> is <unk> , and if you <unk> information <unk> in a computer , these must be very <unk> .
When we <unk> this genome for the first time in <unk> , the standard <unk> was of a <unk> for every 10 <unk> <unk> .
We 've discovered , <unk> , <unk> . If we used that <unk> <unk> <unk> , you could never be able to do it .
One part of the process is to design <unk> 50 <unk> that <unk> with all the other <unk> of 50 <unk> to build smaller <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to build smaller <unk> <unk> that <unk> together .
It 's going to be <unk> here .
You probably read that <unk> us from <unk> .
So , we have a <unk> <unk> <unk> on four <unk> : A , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> of those <unk> <unk> <unk> together , about 20 <unk> , and there 's a <unk> order of <unk> for every <unk> .
So we can use the <unk> code to write words , <unk> , <unk> .
What we 've done is at the beginning was <unk> .
Some have been <unk> by the fact that it was not <unk> .
We designed these <unk> to <unk> just <unk> with <unk> .
There are <unk> that we <unk> them and <unk> them .
And we started to <unk> parts , <unk> with <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to them , <unk> them to <unk> <unk> .
In every step we 've made these <unk> in <unk> so we 're going to <unk> <unk> , and we 're going to see a very <unk> <unk> <unk> like you in a minute .
We 're trying to <unk> the process .
So , this seems to be the <unk> of a <unk> <unk> .
When you start to these <unk> <unk> , more than 100 <unk> <unk> , they 're not <unk> to <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> .
You get to the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> of biology .
So we 've <unk> other <unk> .
<unk> of another <unk> called <unk> <unk> , which in biology <unk> to <unk> the DNA that in biology <unk> to <unk> the DNA .
Here 's an example .
This <unk> , called <unk> <unk> , can <unk> three million <unk> <unk> .
You can see in the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> -- 24 hours it 's <unk> exactly like it was before .
<unk> thousands of organisms that are able to do that .
These organisms can be completely <unk> .
It 's going to live under <unk> .
I 'm absolutely sure that life <unk> in space , and <unk> <unk> to find new <unk> <unk> of water .
<unk> : <unk> has shown that this happens .
This is an image of the <unk> that we 've built with these <unk> , just by using the <unk> with the design <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> <unk> .
This image was not <unk> with a <unk> <unk> , but with a <unk> <unk> .
It 's such a <unk> that we can <unk> with a <unk> <unk> .
These are pictures that <unk> a <unk> of about six seconds .
This is the <unk> we 've done a little time ago .
I 'm more than <unk> <unk> code .
It 's the largest <unk> of a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
It has a <unk> <unk> <unk> to 300 million .
If you <unk> it with a <unk> 10 without spaces , we 'll be <unk> pages to <unk> this code .
Now , how do we do it ? How can we <unk> ?
<unk> , with a virus is a <unk> <unk> .
It 's a little <unk> when you use bacteria .
It 's <unk> even when it 's about <unk> cells like our : you can just <unk> the <unk> and <unk> another , which is that basically the <unk> <unk> .
In <unk> , we <unk> the <unk> <unk> , but we have <unk> <unk> that we 're able to do a <unk> <unk> of a cell to another and <unk> .
We 've got a <unk> <unk> <unk> from a <unk> species .
<unk> are different than men who are <unk> .
We 've got some <unk> <unk> in more <unk> way that we could choose what to choose to do for this <unk> .
And then he <unk> with the <unk> <unk> so that we <unk> all the <unk> .
And when we put it in the cell was <unk> and we <unk> our <unk> the new <unk> went back to the cell .
And we had to <unk> that we don 't go beyond , but we tried to <unk> more <unk> in there .
This is one of the major <unk> of evolution .
We 've found that <unk> species have <unk> a second or a third <unk> <unk> , <unk> in a second thousands of new <unk> to that species .
So who think about evolution as a only <unk> at the time you <unk> doesn 't understand a lot of biology .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> DNA .
The <unk> that was in the cell <unk> , you know ,
The <unk> <unk> we have <unk> .
It 's <unk> , and he <unk> the other <unk> as <unk> material , has <unk> , and we were <unk> with only the cell and the new <unk> .
has become blue because of the genes that we 've <unk> .
And in a short <unk> of time , all of the <unk> of a species are <unk> , and you have to <unk> it all in a new species , <unk> on the new software that we 've <unk> in the cell .
All the <unk> are <unk> , <unk> are <unk> , and when you <unk> the code <unk> exactly to what we 've <unk> you .
Now , this could be <unk> <unk> , but we can <unk> the software that we can change things in a <unk> <unk> .
Now , I 've already <unk> that here doesn 't talk about <unk> -- but of progress , <unk> <unk> from three million years and a half of evolution , and I said that maybe we 're going to create a new version of the <unk> <unk> <unk> that we 're <unk> new species on this <unk> process that we 're going to be <unk> new species on this <unk> process .
Why do that ?
I think it 's pretty <unk> enough when we think about our <unk> .
We 're going to go from six and a half billion people in the next 40 years .
Just to give an example : I was born in <unk> .
Now there are three people on the planet to <unk> in <unk> ; in 40 years , there will be four .
We 're <unk> problems now we find food now , <unk> water and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> for six billion people .
I 'm going to have to do that for nine billion .
<unk> more than five billion <unk> , more than 30 billion <unk> <unk> .
That means 100 million <unk> a day .
When we try to find <unk> <unk> , or any kind of process to <unk> , it will be a huge challenge .
In more we have to realize the whole <unk> of CO2 from these materials that <unk> in the atmosphere .
At day , thank you to the <unk> <unk> around the world , we have a <unk> with about 20 million genes of genes , and I like to think that are the <unk> <unk> for the future .
The <unk> <unk> only a <unk> of <unk> , and think about how many different things are <unk> out .
Our <unk> here are data from reality from <unk> and our imagination .
We have now <unk> , <unk> to these <unk> <unk> <unk> , able to create what we call <unk> <unk> <unk> .
We can make a big robot that can produce a million <unk> a <unk> per day .
Think of <unk> these 20 million genes or <unk> to try to <unk> the <unk> to produce <unk> or <unk> , new <unk> , we can change , with a small team , and create more biology now that in the last 20 years of science .
And it 's simply a standard <unk> .
We can choose to <unk> , <unk> <unk> , chemistry or <unk> , <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
This is a <unk> of some software <unk> that we 're working on , to be able to <unk> and <unk> species to computers .
Well , we don 't know how they 're going to be .
We know exactly what their <unk> code .
Now we 're <unk> on the <unk> generation .
You 've seen you , you know , <unk> <unk> <unk> was a bad experiment .
We 've <unk> <unk> <unk> and third generation that we had enough soon from <unk> to <unk> than than than <unk> or different kinds of <unk> .
But the only way that biology can have a great impact without <unk> <unk> the cost of food and <unk> the <unk> would be <unk> the CO2 in the <unk> , so we 're working on to design cells that we 're working , and we think we can have the first <unk> of <unk> in about 18 months .
<unk> <unk> with CO2 is a <unk> , but in our <unk> <unk> around the world , we 've found different <unk> .
This is a <unk> that we 've <unk> in <unk> .
<unk> in the <unk> , at about <unk> feet deep at the temperature of <unk> water .
<unk> <unk> by CO2 using hydrogen <unk> as hydrogen <unk> as hydrogen .
We 're trying to figure out whether we can <unk> CO2 , which can easily be <unk> by <unk> , <unk> that CO2 in <unk> , to drive this process .
So , we think we might be able to <unk> what the basic question of " which is what life is , we <unk> the <unk> goal to <unk> the whole industry .
<unk> . If you can 't do that TED , where can 't you do it ?
It 's a <unk> of energy .
<unk> , we 're working for using the same <unk> to create <unk> .
You 've seen this year with flu , we always go back a year and with a dollar in less when it 's about find the right <unk> .
I think what you can change building <unk> in <unk> .
Here 's how the future could start to look <unk> , now , the tree of evolution , <unk> the evolution of bacteria , <unk> and then <unk> cells .
We 're in so much than people .
Our purpose is to do in a way of living enough to try to <unk> it . Thank you very much .
First of all , I 'll show you , the <unk> <unk> possible , some <unk> work , some fundamental , of the new technology that we 've brought to <unk> a <unk> a year ago .
It 's a environment that you can <unk> is to local level that you can <unk> with a huge amount of data .
Here we 're seeing <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> with a kind of <unk> <unk> and <unk> , for a fast <unk> , <unk> the images like we want .
And it doesn 't matter how much it 's the amount of information that we see , how big these <unk> are these <unk> of data or data .
Most of them are common <unk> photographs , but this is a <unk> <unk> by the <unk> of <unk> , and <unk> in the <unk> of 300 <unk> .
It doesn 't make any difference because the only thing that <unk> the <unk> of a system like this is the number of <unk> on your screen at any time . It 's also a very <unk> architecture .
This is a whole book , example of data not images .
This is <unk> <unk> <unk> . Every <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
So , to <unk> that it 's just about the text and not images , we can do something like that , to actually see that it 's a real <unk> of the text , not a picture .
It could be a little <unk> to read a little <unk> .
I 'm not going to show you .
This is a <unk> example . It 's a <unk> <unk> .
Every image is the beginning of a <unk> .
And it really gives you the pleasure experience of read the real <unk> version of a <unk> or a <unk> , which is for nature a <unk> or a <unk> , which is for nature a half .
We 've also done something with the corner of this , particularly <unk> .
We created a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> much more than that you use in a normal <unk> , and we 've <unk> <unk> <unk> .
If you want to see the <unk> of this <unk> , you can see here .
Or other models , or even <unk> <unk> .
And this really <unk> some of these ideas to <unk> the <unk> of space on the screen .
I 'm going to <unk> that this <unk> <unk> to put in the <unk> and other <unk> like that , you can 't be <unk> .
Of course , the <unk> is one of the most <unk> <unk> for this kind of technology .
And on this , I don 't want to lose time , if not to say that we have <unk> to give you a <unk> in this field .
These are all the streets in the <unk> <unk> above a NASA <unk> .
So now we start to something else .
This is now actually actually live on the web ; you can see it .
It 's a project called <unk> , which <unk> two different technologies .
One is <unk> and the other is a <unk> research on the very interesting computer made by <unk> <unk> , a <unk> student of Washington , with the help of <unk> <unk> <unk> . <unk> . A <unk> <unk> .
And it 's alive on the web , <unk> <unk> .
You can <unk> when we do this kind of <unk> , where we can go from a picture to the other and have this kind of experience <unk> .
But the <unk> <unk> of the images here actually actually has a meaning .
<unk> <unk> <unk> , and these things have <unk> <unk> these images together , so that we <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> on the <unk> <unk> <unk> on the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and these things have been <unk> . So here you see some <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> , and these things have all <unk> on the <unk> level .
I don 't know if I have time to show you some other environment .
There are much more <unk> .
I want to go directly to one of the <unk> of data , and this <unk> from a <unk> <unk> <unk> that we 've done for the first time , I 'll show you what we 've done is really the key behind this technology , the <unk> technology , <unk> <unk> . And it 's not <unk> as <unk> by looking at the <unk> that we have <unk> in the website .
We had to <unk> some <unk> and so on .
This is a <unk> of <unk> <unk> images <unk> by <unk> . <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> and <unk> images of kinds of <unk> , other <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and so on . <unk> of these <unk> <unk> <unk> an image that 's <unk> <unk> .
So , they 're all <unk> images and have all <unk> <unk> on the <unk> level in this way .
And it 's possible to <unk> this <unk> way .
You know , I would never have thought to work for <unk> .
It 's very <unk> <unk> to <unk> this kind of <unk> here .
I think I 'm going to see that it 's a lot of different kinds of <unk> : from those <unk> <unk> <unk> , a number , <unk> number , <unk> , <unk> with this environment .
And if I can , I can look look for the <unk> .
A lot of are <unk> by <unk> , etc .
There 's a series of photographs -- <unk> .
This is a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
We can go from <unk> to physics of this environment .
The <unk> point is we can do things with social environment . This is now <unk> data from the whole memory memory of how to <unk> the earth , from the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> all that data together .
All of those pictures become <unk> together , more than <unk> parts .
You have a model of the whole thing you 'll get .
Think about this as the <unk> of the work of <unk> <unk> on Earth .
It 's something that 's going to happen in complexity <unk> hand , and the <unk> that we 're going to <unk> it with the use .
Their photos are <unk> <unk> with other people .
If somebody comes the idea of <unk> all these <unk> <unk> <unk> , my <unk> picture of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> of all those data <unk> , and I can use it as a <unk> <unk> and <unk> social experience .
Of course , a <unk> of all this is <unk> <unk> <unk> of every interesting part of the Earth , <unk> not just by <unk> <unk> and <unk> and <unk> images , but the <unk> memory .
Thank you very much .
Chris Anderson : I understand ? What 's your software <unk> to do is that your software <unk> to do is that at some point , all the photographs <unk> that we have been <unk> by anyone in the world will be <unk> <unk> ?
<unk> : Yeah . What 's doing is basically to find out .
He 's creating <unk> , if you want , between images .
And he 's <unk> it to the content of images .
And what it becomes very interesting if you think about <unk> information <unk> that many of these <unk> images .
As you do a <unk> of images on the web , you <unk> a <unk> and the text on the web has a lot of information about images .
Now , what happens if that picture <unk> all of your photos ?
So , the amount of <unk> <unk> and the amount of <unk> that <unk> is really enormous . It 's a <unk> effect .
CA : <unk> , it 's really incredible .
<unk> : I 'm going to give you a lot .
One of the major <unk> when you <unk> and one of the <unk> research is to be able to live in the wind , <unk> the past in the wind , the <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
You think that <unk> <unk> <unk> still <unk> over the <unk> <unk> , or that the <unk> of <unk> <unk> are still <unk> <unk> , or <unk> , <unk> <unk> , to <unk> the <unk> of <unk> , to <unk> the <unk> of <unk> , and that the idea that the world we live in which we live in in which , but it 's just a <unk> of a <unk> , but it 's just a <unk> of <unk> ,
the <unk> of a particular <unk> of <unk> choices that our <unk> has done , good or bad , many <unk> .
And , of course , everybody 's <unk> <unk> .
Everybody <unk> . Everybody <unk> .
We 're <unk> to <unk> <unk> .
We have to deal with the <unk> of death , so we don 't <unk> it up if you <unk> and <unk> --
We all have a art .
What <unk> is the <unk> of the song , the <unk> of every culture .
It doesn 't care that matter the <unk> of <unk> , or the <unk> of <unk> <unk> , or the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , or the <unk> <unk> <unk> , or a <unk> in the <unk> <unk> .
He was my <unk> of journey in <unk> a month ago , or a <unk> of <unk> in the <unk> <unk> , on the <unk> , the <unk> mother of the world .
All of these <unk> <unk> that there are other ways of <unk> other ways of thinking , other ways of moving around the world .
And , if you take a moment , it 's a concept that can give you hope .
<unk> , the <unk> of <unk> of the world create a <unk> of <unk> and <unk> that <unk> the planet and it 's important for the <unk> of the planet , as the <unk> <unk> as a <unk> <unk> .
And you can think of this <unk> <unk> as a <unk> and you can <unk> the <unk> of all the <unk> , dreams , <unk> , <unk> , ideas , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> in being by human imagination .
<unk> is the great <unk> of humanity .
It 's the <unk> of what we 're and what we can be as <unk> species .
And <unk> <unk> was <unk> <unk> <unk> was <unk> to <unk> and <unk> a lot <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , for example , <unk> that 50 percent of all the species has been or is on the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> simply because it 's <unk> , or -- in the <unk> of <unk> diversity -- and not even <unk> than <unk> <unk> -- that you don 't even even <unk> to be <unk> -- that the <unk> diversity .
The <unk> of all of that is , of course , the <unk> <unk> .
When you 're <unk> <unk> <unk> on this planet .
A language is not just <unk> by a <unk> or a series of rules .
A language is the <unk> of the human spirit .
It 's the medium with the <unk> of every culture comes in in the material world .
Every language is a forest of the mind , a <unk> , a <unk> of <unk> .
And of those <unk> <unk> , while we 're sitting here in <unk> , at least half is no longer <unk> in the <unk> of the children .
They 're not <unk> to children , which means less than <unk> something , which is that they 're already death .
What there is more <unk> than being <unk> by <unk> , to be the last last to speak a language , not <unk> the way to talk about a language , <unk> the <unk> of <unk> or <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> or <unk> the <unk> of the children ?
This <unk> <unk> was a <unk> of somebody in the world every two weeks : every two weeks : every two weeks : every two weeks , a <unk> <unk> and door with her <unk> <unk> .
And I know somebody of you know , " Is it not better ? "
The world would not be a better place if we all have the same language ? " <unk> , then we 're all <unk> . <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> .
<unk> of a <unk> thing is to say that we can 't talk about their language .
I 'd like to give you a journey through the <unk> --
a little journey in <unk> to give you a <unk> of what we 're <unk> .
Many of us <unk> that when I say " different ways of <unk> , " I mean , " I really different ways of <unk> . "
<unk> for example this <unk> <unk> , in <unk> <unk> , the <unk> of <unk> , which <unk> <unk> to the <unk> <unk> from the river <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> .
It 's a <unk> that 's not able to <unk> the blue color in the green because the time is <unk> in the forest time , where we <unk> the <unk> .
They have a <unk> language and a <unk> rule , <unk> " <unk> <unk> " : you have to <unk> a person talking a different language .
All of that has <unk> in the past <unk> , but the <unk> is that in these <unk> families , where you 're talking six or seven <unk> because of the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
It <unk> to listen and then you start talking to it .
<unk> one of the most interesting <unk> I lived with , the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , an incredible <unk> that had the first <unk> in <unk> .
In <unk> , five <unk> have <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> .
They 've done by the <unk> photographs that <unk> them in <unk> that <unk> <unk> , <unk> that this <unk> of the <unk> <unk> had never seen anything .
They <unk> the picture of the land , <unk> to <unk> a form or a <unk> and , not <unk> anything , have <unk> <unk> <unk> , and they <unk> the five <unk> with <unk> .
But <unk> don 't just <unk> the <unk> .
They <unk> with them .
<unk> percent <unk> <unk> was <unk> by themselves .
We 're <unk> to eight <unk> and we found two <unk> of death and when we <unk> to know , they <unk> that one of them was so that he died , and then they <unk> it . <unk> the same . [ <unk> ] <unk> every way , had an incredible <unk> <unk> of the <unk> .
<unk> were able to recognize the animal <unk> from 40 <unk> and <unk> the species .
<unk> <unk> , and I was a very interesting task when my <unk> <unk> to me if my <unk> <unk> to me if I wanted to go to <unk> between society <unk> to the base of the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> .
To give a sense of <unk> , I should have to understand the culture culture and that <unk> is not <unk> <unk> .
It 's pretty much about a <unk> view of the world .
Very interesting .
If you tell you about <unk> the great <unk> of the world , what would you like ?
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , etc .
A continent has always been <unk> out , thinking , <unk> Africa doesn 't have <unk> <unk> . And instead and yes and the <unk> is not another that the <unk> of these <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> .
And what makes it interesting is the <unk> relationship between life and death .
So the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> can be <unk> by <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> to the <unk> of the living <unk> in a way that for a moment the <unk> becomes the <unk> .
So , the <unk> <unk> to say " <unk> go to <unk> God .
We <unk> in <unk> and <unk> God . "
And the moment that you 're <unk> , is the spirit that you can <unk> you , how can you <unk> ?
So , you start to these incredible events : <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a pretty <unk> of the power of the mind when it 's <unk> in a state of <unk> <unk> .
<unk> all the <unk> with which I lived with the most <unk> are the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , in the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> that once once <unk> on the <unk> of <unk> in <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> on the <unk> .
In a <unk> continent , this <unk> never been <unk> by <unk> .
In <unk> , I 'm <unk> by a <unk> , but their education is extraordinary <unk> .
<unk> <unk> are <unk> by <unk> to four or four , and they live in a world <unk> and <unk> in a <unk> world of <unk> and <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> for 18 years .
Two <unk> years old <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , now are <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> .
For all this time , they 're <unk> to the values of their <unk> , <unk> that their <unk> and only their <unk> <unk> <unk> -- or to say the <unk> <unk> .
At the end of this amazing <unk> , they come <unk> out and for the first time in their life , at age of 18 , see an <unk> . And in that moment of the first <unk> , when the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , all that they 've learned in the <unk> <unk> , all that they 've learned in the <unk> <unk> , all that they 've learned in the <unk> <unk> . <unk> <unk> <unk> , all the <unk> <unk> , all the what they 're <unk> in the <unk> theory is <unk> .
" <unk> ? I 'm going to tell you . "
It 's <unk> . Now it 's <unk> . "
They call them more and they say that we , <unk> <unk> , we are the <unk> of the world .
This is extremely important .
When we think about <unk> <unk> and the <unk> environment and the <unk> <unk> and the old story of <unk> <unk> , which is a <unk> concept in his <unk> or maybe <unk> <unk> and say that these <unk> are <unk> to the Earth .
<unk> <unk> are not <unk> or <unk> <unk> by <unk> .
There 's no space for these things in the <unk> of <unk> or in the <unk> <unk> of <unk> , but for time and <unk> , have created a <unk> of the Earth <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> , have created a <unk> of the Earth can live only because it 's <unk> by human <unk> .
What does it mean ?
It means that a <unk> of the <unk> that <unk> <unk> that the mountain is a <unk> human human being <unk> to be <unk> different human human being <unk> and have a very different relationship with the mountain or the <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> a mountain of a <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> a mountain of <unk> to be <unk> .
which is a <unk> of one spirit or a <unk> <unk> is <unk> .
And what 's interesting is that we 're going to <unk> the relationship between the <unk> and natural world .
I grew up in the <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> to be <unk> .
And that made me a human being different than my friends who believe that the <unk> are the <unk> of <unk> and the <unk> <unk> and the <unk> <unk> and the <unk> <unk> that live in the <unk> <unk> <unk> , which <unk> in the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
If you start <unk> that these <unk> can actually create different , we start to understand some of them <unk> <unk> . They <unk> this <unk> .
I 've <unk> this picture to <unk> in <unk> <unk> .
Maybe some of you have heard about <unk> , the most powerful <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> .
And what makes the <unk> is not the potential of <unk> , but his <unk> . It 's <unk> by two elements .
On one side , this <unk> <unk> <unk> a series of <unk> , <unk> and <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
<unk> the only <unk> <unk> <unk> a little bit that <unk> a little <unk> , but it 's <unk> with the <unk> of a <unk> of the family of <unk> said <unk> .
This <unk> <unk> <unk> , very similar to <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
If you 're going to see the <unk> <unk> <unk> on the <unk> that they 're doing a different <unk> of species , <unk> it <unk> .
<unk> that <unk> on the <unk> is a little bit of like being <unk> by a <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> on a sea of electricity . [ <unk> ] [ <unk> ] [ <unk> ] [ <unk> ] [ <unk> ] ] ] ] ] ] ] <unk> .
I often <unk> with my <unk> , Richard <unk> <unk> , the man who <unk> was <unk> , with his discovery of <unk> <unk> in the ' <unk> in the ' <unk> .
<unk> my <unk> can 't be <unk> these <unk> as <unk> because if you 're done not tell anybody to be <unk> . [ <unk> ] ] you can 't be <unk> because they 're <unk> by a <unk> that <unk> <unk> in the <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
It 's possible to <unk> only if you start with other <unk> <unk> that <unk> the <unk> .
Now it 's the good : the <unk> that are in this <unk> are <unk> , <unk> <unk> , the same <unk> to <unk> the <unk> . The question <unk> <unk> : in a <unk> <unk> species of plants , how do these <unk> <unk> two <unk> <unk> <unk> not that , but what if you look in this way , they create a <unk> version that 's <unk> <unk> ?
We use the <unk> <unk> and <unk> , which can <unk> <unk> .
But if you go to the <unk> , we 'll be " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " <unk> " " " " " " " "
What does it mean ?
This <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , who <unk> <unk> in the forest , and that our eyes <unk> in the forest , and that our eyes <unk> in the same species .
If you <unk> how to <unk> their <unk> , you 'll <unk> them , " <unk> " <unk> " " <unk> " " No . "
The solution is : they take <unk> <unk> in a <unk> night , <unk> <unk> with a different <unk> .
And with this doesn 't <unk> to <unk> , but it 's much more interesting than <unk> <unk> .
Now , [ <unk> ] the problem is that even those of us who have to heart <unk> <unk> them , but in some way we <unk> the <unk> of history than the world , and <unk> .
In fact , the <unk> century , in 300 years , not <unk> <unk> for his <unk> or his <unk> <unk> , but rather like the was that we 've been <unk> and <unk> or <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> of diversity and <unk> and <unk> <unk> on the planet . Now , the problem is not the change .
All the <unk> through the <unk> have been <unk> in a new <unk> of life .
And the problem is not technology .
<unk> <unk> have no <unk> to be <unk> when they put up <unk> and <unk> and <unk> like the <unk> have no <unk> to be <unk> when they put up <unk> and <unk> .
It 's not the change or technology that <unk> the <unk> of <unk> . It 's power .
The <unk> <unk> of <unk> .
And if you look at a world , you 'll see that these are not <unk> <unk> to <unk> .
They 're <unk> creatures and <unk> <unk> <unk> out of existence by <unk> forces that go beyond their <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> --
a <unk> <unk> <unk> , where you can see the <unk> <unk> , a <unk> that lived in the forest until a generation ago , and now <unk> the <unk> and the <unk> of the <unk> , where you can see the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> by the <unk> <unk> <unk> , where the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , where the <unk> <unk> <unk> , where the <unk> <unk> <unk> , where the <unk> <unk> <unk> ,
<unk> to <unk> the <unk> with the <unk> <unk> to the forest .
Or , in the case of <unk> , are diseases that are <unk> with the <unk> discovery of <unk> .
If you put on the <unk> of the <unk> , where I 'm doing a lot of research , you 'll see the <unk> of politics .
As a <unk> , <unk> physics of a <unk> , is <unk> to a <unk> , but the <unk> , the <unk> of <unk> <unk> , not only is <unk> , but <unk> in certain certain <unk> , because it 's a part of the development of the development .
And you can 't understand the <unk> of the <unk> until you get part of the beginning .
I <unk> <unk> miles from <unk> in China through the <unk> <unk> , <unk> to <unk> with a young <unk> , but only got to <unk> with me , what the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> million people <unk> from <unk> during the <unk> <unk> .
The father of this guy was <unk> at <unk> <unk> .
And that means that it was <unk> at the time of Chinese <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> with <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> , which led the <unk> in <unk> .
My mother was <unk> and his <unk> was being <unk> .
It was brought to <unk> in <unk> at age of two years <unk> under his <unk> because he couldn 't live without him .
<unk> , who did the same , was <unk> in <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and for this <unk> , was <unk> to the <unk> <unk> for seven years .
The pain of <unk> can be <unk> , but the spirit of the <unk> of <unk> is by <unk> present .
<unk> , everything <unk> to a choice .
<unk> you live in the <unk> world or we want to <unk> the <unk> world of diversity of diversity ?
The great <unk> <unk> <unk> , before he died said that his greatest fear was that his greatest fear was that , in our <unk> <unk> to the world , not only <unk> the whole <unk> of human imagination to a <unk> <unk> of thought , but a day we <unk> us from a <unk> <unk> <unk> that there were other possibilities .
And it 's <unk> to remember that our species is <unk> for <unk> years .
<unk> <unk> , which has given us to <unk> us , which has done us by <unk> <unk> , <unk> the <unk> <unk> with the <unk> of <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> world has <unk> 300 years .
That <unk> story not to <unk> me that we have the answers to all the challenges that we 're going to <unk> in <unk> .
When you know , <unk> of the world 's <unk> , what it means to be human , <unk> with <unk> different <unk> .
And it 's in these answers that we all <unk> the chance of being what we are : a kind of <unk> , which must be <unk> , all the <unk> and all the <unk> can <unk> . And there are great moments of <unk> .
I <unk> this picture on the <unk> <unk> of <unk> , when I went to <unk> with <unk> , and this man , <unk> , <unk> me , he <unk> me the wonderful story of his <unk> .
The government <unk> was not always <unk> with the <unk> <unk> and in the ' <unk> to <unk> our <unk> , we <unk> them in <unk> .
The <unk> of this man <unk> <unk> .
<unk> , <unk> for his life , <unk> <unk> all the <unk> , and all his <unk> .
You know , you don 't know the cold , <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> were made of <unk> fish <unk> in skin of <unk> .
The <unk> of this man didn 't <unk> by night or <unk> <unk> .
It 's <unk> away , it 's <unk> the <unk> <unk> in <unk> and <unk> in your hand . When I did it , he <unk> it , he <unk> it <unk> .
He <unk> <unk> on the <unk> of this <unk> <unk> and when <unk> <unk> , he <unk> a dog .
He <unk> the dog and created a <unk> , with the <unk> <unk> created a <unk> , <unk> a <unk> , <unk> a <unk> and it 's <unk> on the <unk> , <unk> <unk> in <unk> .
<unk> to talk about <unk> ? [ [ <unk> ] and that , in different ways , [ <unk> ] [ is the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and all the <unk> <unk> of the world .
<unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> government <unk> to <unk> the <unk> control of an area of larger <unk> of California and <unk> <unk> .
It 's their new <unk> . It 's called <unk> .
It 's a <unk> <unk> . We <unk> all the resources <unk> .
One <unk> example of how a <unk> can <unk> with his <unk> .
And , finally , I think , is quite <unk> at least who we have been in these <unk> <unk> <unk> on the planet , <unk> that are not at all .
For somebody is home .
<unk> <unk> of human imagination that <unk> to <unk> the <unk> of the times . And for us all , the dreams of these children , as the dreams of our children , become part of the hope of the hope .
<unk> , we <unk> <unk> <unk> we are <unk> that <unk> never <unk> to anything .
I 'm going to say <unk> --
[ <unk> ] [ <unk> ] , they 're not <unk> , but we believe that stories can change the world , and perhaps we are the best <unk> to tell the stories of the world . Every month our website <unk> <unk> million <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> our <unk> <unk> .
Our <unk> are <unk> by millions of people .
Our work is <unk> in <unk> to bring our audience to our audience in places to <unk> <unk> from what they saw and <unk> from , and we have to find a <unk> of <unk> : the <unk> world of <unk> <unk> in diversity , and we have to find a <unk> <unk> life in a <unk> world and we have to find a <unk> <unk> in a <unk> world and <unk> .
where the <unk> of all <unk> can <unk> to our <unk> <unk> .
Thank you .
I 'm going to talk about some of the things I 've written in this book that I hope you 've heard of <unk> and <unk> some <unk> , in the case you don 't know .
I 'd like to start with what I call " the <unk> <unk> . "
<unk> <unk> of what ?
The <unk> <unk> of all the <unk> society . The <unk> <unk> <unk> : " If we want to <unk> the <unk> of our citizens . " The way to do it is to <unk> the freedom to do it is to <unk> the freedom . "
The reason is , on one side , in fact that freedom is <unk> is <unk> , <unk> , <unk> for human beings .
<unk> is that if we 're <unk> , each of us can act to <unk> to do everything that we <unk> our <unk> , without anybody who <unk> in our <unk> .
The way to <unk> the freedom is to <unk> the choice .
More choices people have , more <unk> are <unk> , and more they 're <unk> , and more <unk> is their <unk> , and more <unk> is their <unk> .
This , <unk> , it 's so <unk> <unk> in the society that no one <unk> <unk> in <unk> .
And it 's also <unk> <unk> in our lives .
I 'm going to show you some examples of what progress has made possible .
This is my <unk> . It 's not particularly big .
I 'm going to give me a simple note on the <unk> to <unk> .
In my <unk> , there are <unk> <unk> , without <unk> the 10 <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> and the 12 <unk> <unk> that you can buy for a huge number of <unk> in the <unk> <unk> that no one of the <unk> <unk> <unk> is <unk> of your <unk> .
Here 's what the <unk> is .
Then you go to the <unk> <unk> <unk> to buy a <unk> : <unk> , <unk> , radio , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
And in this single <unk> <unk> , there 's a great number of <unk> <unk> .
We can do six and a half million different <unk> using the <unk> that there are only a <unk> store .
<unk> <unk> that there is <unk> choice .
<unk> <unk> : the world of <unk> .
Once , I was a child , you could get all the services <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> that were <unk> by <unk> <unk> .
You <unk> the phone , not <unk> .
A <unk> of that , between the other , was that the phone never <unk> .
These times , they went .
We have now a <unk> <unk> of <unk> , especially between cell phones .
Here 's the <unk> of the future .
My <unk> is in the middle , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , and <unk> for the <unk> <unk> .
If you don 't have it yet , you 're not <unk> , you 're <unk> that soon you 're <unk> that soon you can be <unk> .
And what 's going on is that people <unk> in the <unk> and it does this question . And you know , is the answer ? " No . "
It 's not possible to buy a <unk> that doesn 't face things .
So , in other <unk> of life that are much more important than <unk> , <unk> the same <unk> of choices .
<unk> <unk> : No longer happens in the United States that you <unk> from <unk> and the <unk> you <unk> what you have to do .
Instead , <unk> from <unk> , and the <unk> says , " OK , we could do it , or <unk> , " <unk> , we could do it , or <unk> " A , " he got these <unk> and these <unk> . What do you want to do ? "
You <unk> him , " What do you want to do ? "
And the <unk> says , " <unk> has these <unk> and these <unk> , and <unk> <unk> . "
" What do you want to do ? "
And you say , " <unk> if she was me , what would you like ? "
And the <unk> : " I 'm not her . "
The result we call " <unk> " <unk> " , " <unk> " <unk> " , " <unk> " <unk> " . "
But actually , it 's not a <unk> the weight and responsibility to make decisions from somebody who knows something , <unk> the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , to <unk> anything else -- and almost certainly is <unk> -- and so that in the <unk> <unk> to take the patient and responsibility and responsibility for the patient , which is that the patient .
There 's a huge <unk> of <unk> products , <unk> to people like me and you , that if you think about this doesn 't make sense , because we can 't <unk> .
But if we can 't <unk> , why ?
The answer is they want to <unk> , we call the <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> of so <unk> , like our <unk> now is a question of choice , how you see in this <unk> . " We don 't want to <unk> children . <unk> their sex at the right time . " Don 't <unk> a <unk> : we have to <unk> it .
And we can <unk> how many times we <unk> .
which means that every <unk> , <unk> , you have to decide that that kind of person you want to be .
<unk> to the family and <unk> , a time time , <unk> <unk> , almost to anyone , was that was that you could <unk> the <unk> early early as possible , and you start , and you start to <unk> the <unk> .
The only real choice was with who , not when , and even what to do later .
<unk> , it 's really to play .
<unk> to very smart students , and they <unk> them , 20 percent less work than a time .
And not because they 're not <unk> , not because they 're not <unk> .
but why am I <unk> , I 'm going to say , " <unk> or not ? "
" <unk> <unk> <unk> . I have to think about <unk> or children or my career ? "
They 're <unk> <unk> .
And they try to answer these questions , even if this <unk> doesn 't <unk> the <unk> that we don 't get the <unk> that we don 't get a great <unk> to my <unk> .
And they really have to do that . They 're important questions .
Now , the work : we 're <unk> , as <unk> <unk> , because technology technology allows us to work every minute , from every day , from every day of the planet , <unk> from the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , there is a <unk> , and I 'm not going to say to what the <unk> works .
I 'm not going to tell you , because I want to use it .
What does , this incredible freedom of choice that we have about work ? It 's that we have to decide , <unk> at any time , if we have to work or not .
We can go to see our son to play <unk> , with the phone in a <unk> , the <unk> in the other , and the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
And even if I 'm all <unk> , every minute we see our son , we 're also <unk> , we 're <unk> , we 're also <unk> , " I have to answer this call ? "
" I have to <unk> this <unk> ? I have to <unk> this letter ? "
And even when the answer is " no , that makes the experience of your <unk> very different <unk> of your son very different than what would be in other conditions .
So , from any of them , you look , things , little and big objects , life is a question of choices .
Once the world was this : <unk> , there were some possibilities , but it was not a question of choice .
The world today is to <unk> this : The <unk> is , " Is it a <unk> thing , or <unk> ? "
The answer is <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , we all know , so I 'm going to talk about those <unk> .
<unk> this choice <unk> two effects effects of people .
The first , <unk> , is that <unk> instead of <unk> .
With many <unk> between which choose , it becomes very difficult to do it .
I 'll give you an <unk> example : a study <unk> on <unk> <unk> .
A <unk> <unk> <unk> in different data , the <unk> <unk> society , with about a million <unk> <unk> in different companies .
What she discovered is that for every 10 solutions that are <unk> in more , the <unk> of <unk> two percent .
With 50 <unk> <unk> , there 's 10 percent less <unk> than when they 're available only five percent in when they 're only five percent in the time . Why ?
Because with 50 <unk> <unk> , which choose , is very hard to decide , and the choice is <unk> to the <unk> .
And in <unk> , and still <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and of course , <unk> never <unk> .
<unk> that doesn 't mean just that these <unk> <unk> <unk> food to <unk> because they 're not going to have enough money , it 's going to say that the decision is so <unk> that we 're also going to say that the <unk> <unk> <unk> of work .
They 're not <unk> , they 're <unk> to <unk> <unk> for year from <unk> , which would be <unk> <unk> to <unk> .
So the <unk> is a <unk> of <unk> choices .
And I think we 'll be the world like this .
" And to end , to the <unk> : <unk> , <unk> or <unk> ? "
You just have to take the right decision , if it 's for the <unk> , right ?
You don 't want to choose the <unk> wrong , and you 'll <unk> the wrong <unk> .
So this is the first effect . The second one is that if we can <unk> the <unk> and do a choice , at the end , we 're less <unk> by the result of how we have been with less <unk> between which one one .
And that 's a different reasons .
One of them is that we have to choose , if you <unk> one and it 's not perfect , it 's very great , it 's easy to imagine that they could do a different choice . And what happens is that the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> us to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> by <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> by <unk> ,
And even when it was a <unk> decision .
More choices there are , more choices to <unk> than any <unk> that it 's <unk> of <unk> choice .
<unk> , there 's what <unk> call .
Dan <unk> has <unk> very well , how the value we give things to the <unk> things that we <unk> .
<unk> rest , when there are many <unk> possible , it 's easy to <unk> the <unk> of <unk> <unk> and be less <unk> than the <unk> that it 's choice .
Here 's an example . I 'm going to <unk> with everyone who I 'm not in New York .
But that 's probably <unk> .
There 's this <unk> to the <unk> .
A place of <unk> .
<unk> <unk> . <unk> day . It 's all about them .
I 'm not going to talk about anything . But what he thinks is , " Well , <unk> , it 's <unk> . "
" All my <unk> <unk> are away . "
" <unk> <unk> <unk> right in front of the home . "
And it <unk> two weeks from the idea that 's <unk> -- every day -- the <unk> of <unk> where you want .
The <unk> <unk> <unk> for what we have , even when the choice was <unk> .
And the <unk> we have <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> on how to <unk> .
Here 's another example .
This <unk> tells us a lot of things .
It 's about the moment , and maybe a living living .
But the most important thing is that anything you 're going to be , you 'll <unk> to do other .
The things that don 't <unk> have a lot of <unk> that can make less <unk> what we do .
<unk> <unk> : <unk> <unk> .
I tried it on my skin <unk> a couple of <unk> .
It 's almost always <unk> .
Once the <unk> were only one , <unk> them and <unk> <unk> , were <unk> , only after <unk> , were <unk> , only after <unk> a life and <unk> a lot of times , <unk> to go well .
So , I started to <unk> a couple of a new when the <unk> were gone , and I said , " I need a couple of <unk> , this is my <unk> . "
The <unk> <unk> said , " You want to <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> ? "
You want to <unk> them with <unk> or <unk> ? " <unk> " or " <unk> ? "
" <unk> wants to <unk> ? "
" <unk> wants to <unk> or <unk> ? <unk> <unk> <unk> -- " <unk> to <unk> . "
I was <unk> , and after a little bit I was able to say , " I want the guy that was the only guy , " I 'd like to be , so for a time . I <unk> all ' <unk> <unk> , then I was <unk> by the <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , with the best <unk> I ever had .
It was the <unk> . With all that choice I had <unk> the best .
But I 'm going to get worse .
Why ? I wrote a whole book to <unk> .
The reason I was worse is that with all my <unk> were <unk> , the <unk> <unk> to be <unk> .
I had <unk> <unk> . I was not going to <unk> me when I just had a guy , but when I was 100 different , <unk> , at least one guy had to be perfect .
What I had <unk> was good , but not a great <unk> .
And after I had <unk> to <unk> with what I was <unk> in <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> in the life of people do not <unk> that <unk> the <unk> that these have respect to the <unk> <unk> .
And this <unk> <unk> , even when the results are good .
<unk> in the world 's <unk> if you get it .
Because if I <unk> it , I 'm not talking about what I 'm talking about .
The truth is more than that .
" It was better when you was worse , " The reason why he was better when he was worse is that when you was worse is still <unk> <unk> .
<unk> , in the world that we live in -- <unk> , <unk> citizens with the <unk> of <unk> -- the <unk> that we can <unk> is that things are to be <unk> .
You 've never ever <unk> <unk> because your <unk> , my <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
The <unk> of happiness -- what you 're here -- is , " <unk> <unk> " Yes , you want . "
I mean -- little <unk> moment -- which I 'm really <unk> and my wife is really <unk> .
I couldn 't do better , I 'm not <unk> .
But <unk> is not always a <unk> thing .
<unk> , a <unk> of a <unk> <unk> <unk> when there is just that kind of <unk> is that when you 're not <unk> , and you 're not <unk> , and I 'm going to tell you , " Why ? "
" Who is <unk> ? " <unk> is <unk> . "
The world is <unk> . What can I do ?
When you have hundreds of kinds of <unk> , and you get a <unk> , and you 'll give you a <unk> , and you 'll <unk> you who is the <unk> , you 're <unk> that the <unk> are you .
I could have better .
With hundreds of <unk> <unk> , there are no <unk> for <unk> .
So when people make decisions , even if you <unk> , it 's <unk> , they <unk> and they <unk> to themselves .
In the last few years , the <unk> is <unk> in the world .
I think a <unk> <unk> -- not the only , but important -- of this <unk> <unk> is that people have <unk> experiences because the standard <unk> are too <unk> .
And when they have to <unk> this situation think that <unk> is them .
So the final result is that we 're better , <unk> , but we 'll get worse .
I 'm going to show you .
This is the <unk> <unk> , what we all take for good and it 's completely <unk> . It 's not true .
There 's no <unk> that a little bit of choice is better than a little bit of choice is that we don 't <unk> that much choice is better than a little bit .
There 's a <unk> , <unk> . I don 't know what it is .
But I 'm sure we 've <unk> from a piece of the level where the choices <unk> our life .
Now , from the <unk> <unk> -- I almost finished -- from the <unk> of view , the <unk> is the <unk> .
And what it allows all this choice in the <unk> society is the <unk> material .
There are many places in the world , and you will <unk> <unk> , where the problem is not that they have <unk> choice .
The problem is they have too <unk> .
So the <unk> I 'm talking about is a <unk> <unk> of <unk> , <unk> society .
And what <unk> does and <unk> is this : <unk> <unk> <unk> talked about yesterday than that <unk> and <unk> <unk> to be <unk> . It 's a <unk> of money .
I mean , these choices , <unk> and <unk> , it 's not that simply <unk> .
They 're <unk> <unk> .
They do anything about it .
If a little bit of what in our society allows choice to be <unk> in those where people have too few <unk> , it wouldn 't be just their life , but also our own own life .
This is what <unk> call a <unk> <unk> .
A <unk> of income is good for everyone -- not just the poor -- not just the poor -- because of this choice in <unk> that we <unk> .
So to end , " <unk> , you can become everything you want to --
<unk> , people of culture , <unk> : " What do you know ? "
" It 's <unk> that you can 't do anything in a glass <unk> . "
" A <unk> imagination , a <unk> vision of the world --
and I <unk> it up , I <unk> it , at the beginning .
But then , <unk> , I realized that that fish knows that that fish knows that fish knows .
Because the reality is that if you <unk> the <unk> , so that you can 't <unk> the freedom . You can 't <unk> the freedom . You <unk> the <unk> .
If you look at the <unk> <unk> so that you could <unk> the <unk> .
<unk> the <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Everybody needs a <unk> .
This is almost certainly too <unk> , maybe even for the fish , and certainly for us .
But the <unk> of some <unk> <unk> is a <unk> for the <unk> and , <unk> , for <unk> .
Thank you very much .
