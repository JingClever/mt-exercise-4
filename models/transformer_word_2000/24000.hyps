<unk> year I showed these <unk> <unk> <unk> , which for almost three million years has had the size of the United States <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> 40 percent .
I 'm going to <unk> this <unk> of the problem because it doesn 't show the <unk> of the ice .
<unk> <unk> <unk> is , in a way , the heart of the global system .
They <unk> and <unk> in summer .
The next <unk> will be a <unk> <unk> on the last 25 years .
<unk> <unk> are <unk> in red .
As you see , you see , it 's <unk> up to the blue <unk> .
That 's the ice in <unk> , which is <unk> in summer .
You can see that the <unk> <unk> ice , five years or more , is like blood , which here is from the body .
In 25 years , it 's been on like this .
This is a problem because the <unk> <unk> <unk> around the ocean , where there are enormous amount of <unk> that , <unk> , <unk> , are <unk> <unk> in <unk> .
<unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> by global warming , that amount of <unk> could <unk> , and then you don 't understand .
In some of the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> is already <unk> by the water .
The <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> last <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> ! <unk> : You 're doing good . You know , the question is if you <unk> it .
A reason is that this <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> from the north .
This is a river in <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> had never <unk> <unk> .
This is the <unk> river , in the <unk> of <unk> .
If you want to know how the <unk> level to <unk> <unk> on <unk> , you know , here 's where the sea is where the sea .
These <unk> are <unk> <unk> .
<unk> the other part of the planet : <unk> , the largest <unk> of the ice on the planet .
The last month scientists have <unk> that the <unk> of ice is in <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> , which <unk> on some <unk> <unk> , is particularly <unk> in <unk> .
<unk> at <unk> feet , as <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> of ice , <unk> , <unk> new <unk> , which a few years ago were <unk> .
<unk> percent of the world 's population <unk> by the <unk> water .
<unk> <unk> : this <unk> is the source of water <unk> of this city .
<unk> is <unk> .
But when you <unk> , the same happens to <unk> water .
In California , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> is 40 percent .
<unk> <unk> are in crisis .
<unk> , as you read , they 're <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> in the world leads to a <unk> increase in the world .
<unk> <unk> are <unk> to a <unk> outside the normal and <unk> .
<unk> times more <unk> over the last 30 years than <unk> <unk> .
This is a <unk> of <unk> .
If you look at it in the <unk> context , you can see the <unk> .
In the last five years we have <unk> 70 million <unk> of CO2 every 24 hours -- 25 million <unk> in the ocean every day .
Look at <unk> <unk> , from <unk> , to <unk> , to <unk> , and on both parts of the <unk> <unk> , where there 's a <unk> <unk> of oxygen in the ocean .
The biggest cause of global warming , with <unk> , which is 20 percent , is the use of <unk> .
The oil is a problem , and <unk> is even worse .
The United States is one of the two countries with <unk> emissions , together .
And it 's <unk> to build a lot of other <unk> .
But we 're <unk> to a <unk> of direction .
These are the <unk> projects over the last years and some <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
<unk> , there 's a <unk> policy in our country .
<unk> and oil <unk> have <unk> million dollars in the last year to <unk> <unk> , which is a <unk> .
I 'm going to tell you something --
<unk> <unk> , where I live , there was a <unk> of <unk> billion <unk> .
Maybe you saw it on the <unk> .
This is the second greatest flow of <unk> in America .
It 's happened around <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> of one of <unk> was this .
<unk> : <unk> â™« <unk> the <unk> is a <unk> and happy .
It 's <unk> here in America , and to grow our economy .
<unk> is <unk> <unk> .
It 's <unk> , <unk> and <unk> <unk> it <unk> .
Al <unk> : <unk> is a lot of <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The greatest <unk> society on the <unk> is <unk> <unk> . This is his <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> -- <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> -- not know what they 're talking about .
<unk> : So the <unk> for the <unk> of <unk> has <unk> two <unk> .
This is one of them , one .
<unk> : <unk> : <unk> <unk> we see <unk> changes as a <unk> <unk> to our business .
So , our <unk> is a great amount of money in a <unk> <unk> to <unk> public and <unk> the truth on <unk> .
In fact , <unk> is not <unk> .
We think it 's <unk> -- it 's got a good <unk> .
So we don 't <unk> about climate change .
We need to do .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> -- you 've heard about it a lot .
So I 'm going to <unk> a <unk> in a <unk> structure as <unk> .
<unk> ! <unk> are a little bit , but this is the sound of <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> is between the main <unk> of global warming , but <unk> technology <unk> that you see changes everything .
Let 's look : this is the <unk> technology <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to the economic issue and national security .
<unk> : America is in crisis ; America is in crisis ; the national security crisis .
The <unk> that <unk> all : our <unk> <unk> <unk> , like <unk> and oil and oil <unk> .
Now , there 's a new , <unk> solution to <unk> .
<unk> America : 100 percent of <unk> energy , in 10 years .
A <unk> <unk> for <unk> America at work , more <unk> , and help <unk> global warming .
<unk> , a solution that we could solve our problems .
<unk> America . <unk> more .
Al <unk> : This is the last .
<unk> : It 's about <unk> power .
One of the most <unk> ways to <unk> <unk> from the <unk> that <unk> our planet .
<unk> : The future is here . <unk> , a new <unk> network .
<unk> <unk> two : <unk> <unk> for jobs <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> America . It 's time to be <unk> .
<unk> : A old <unk> <unk> says , " If you want to go <unk> , go to alone .
If you want to go away , go . "
We need to go far , quickly .
Thank you very much .
<unk> year at TED I did a <unk> on <unk> .
And I 'm going to try to <unk> how the car works .
So I 'm going to go . And for the other time , there were , the <unk> is the greatest <unk> experiment that we ever had -- <unk> kilometers of <unk> .
His task is to <unk> the conditions that were in the <unk> than a second from the beginning of the universe -- to <unk> million times a second .
That 's just <unk> .
This is the machine below <unk> .
I 'm going to <unk> these <unk> <unk> inside the <unk> .
This is what I work . It 's called <unk> -- it 's <unk> feet and it has a <unk> <unk> .
This is a <unk> picture of <unk> in building so you can see <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> of last year we <unk> the car for the first time .
And this picture was <unk> by <unk> .
It was <unk> <unk> in the control room .
It 's an image of the first <unk> of particles that had made all the <unk> , <unk> , with a part of the <unk> , and <unk> , with a part of the <unk> , and <unk> particles inside the <unk> .
In other words , when you look at that picture 10 <unk> , I 'm going to <unk> the machine , which is a great <unk> .
I don 't know if it was this to <unk> us more or this , when someone <unk> on Google and <unk> that the <unk> was this .
That means we 've had a <unk> impact beyond that scientific .
<unk> a week later , there was a problem with the machine , had to these <unk> here -- these <unk> <unk> .
These <unk> <unk> <unk> when the car works at the <unk> of the <unk> .
Now , the <unk> of you <unk> the <unk> and <unk> , " It 's not true . I 'm <unk> too <unk> . "
And instead they can do it because when they 're very <unk> become the <unk> <unk> .
So at least <unk> degrees , at a temperature <unk> at the <unk> of space between stars , these <unk> can bring that <unk> .
In one of the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , there was a <unk> <unk> .
So the <unk> <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a electric electric <unk> .
This was the result .
Now , this is even more <unk> if you think that these <unk> <unk> more than 20 <unk> , and that 's about 30 <unk> .
They <unk> about 50 <unk> .
<unk> , what we did .
We <unk> them and <unk> .
They 're all <unk> in their <unk> .
<unk> the end of <unk> the <unk> will be again .
We <unk> it , and we try to get data <unk> or <unk> , and so on our <unk> to discover what the <unk> are the universe .
Now , of course , in a way , these <unk> <unk> the <unk> of science and engineering engineering <unk> . It 's easy to <unk> .
I think it 's so hard , the fact that 's going on beyond <unk> , I think it 's this the value of things like <unk> .
I 'd like to end with the words of a <unk> <unk> , who , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> experiments of his <unk> , his <unk> was <unk> , said , " It 's 's so much as <unk> that the ideas of science are <unk> , that there are no new , that there are no new <unk> in nature , that there are no new <unk> by <unk> .
Thank you .
I want to start <unk> to when , as children , <unk> with <unk> .
<unk> how we <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> is <unk> <unk> to the way that most of the world around us .
So , from <unk> <unk> from the <unk> of our <unk> with objects , with my <unk> <unk> , and my <unk> <unk> , and I started <unk> , " And if we use a computer , instead of having the only <unk> <unk> as digital <unk> that <unk> on a <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> an information <unk> with both hands , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> an information with both with both hands .
and <unk> to our <unk> ?
The question was so interesting that I tried to explore the answer , building the <unk> .
In a few words , a <unk> is a <unk> computer as a <unk> .
In a few words , a <unk> is a <unk> computer as a <unk> .
You can <unk> them with your hand , they can <unk> them , and they have a screen and radio <unk> .
But <unk> , they 're <unk> objects , like <unk> , you can just <unk> .
<unk> are the <unk> of a new <unk> of tools to <unk> digital information .
And as they become more <unk> , <unk> of the <unk> , <unk> of the other , and as they become more <unk> , <unk> of the <unk> , <unk> of the other , of how we <unk> them , we can explore and <unk> <unk> .
Let 's start with some simple example .
This <unk> is <unk> to show : if you <unk> it in a direction , the video will be <unk> so , if you go to the other side .
These <unk> <unk> are <unk> of other people .
If you <unk> them , you look at what they are around .
If they come , they can <unk> it and they can <unk> a little bit .
If they come , they can <unk> it and they can <unk> a little bit .
They also <unk> their movement and <unk> .
We have <unk> that one of the interesting <unk> of the <unk> was to be able to use common data on the data , for example , <unk> , which is a color as if it was a <unk> .
In this case , we have three <unk> <unk> like <unk> <unk> and I can <unk> to <unk> color in central that , where they <unk> .
and I can <unk> to <unk> color in the central where you 're <unk> .
If we get too much , we can <unk> a little bit .
There are also <unk> possibilities , like <unk> , <unk> , how <unk> , and <unk> the <unk> where people can try things things , and <unk> the results immediately .
I 'm --
This is a <unk> sequence I do with a <unk> program .
Here we have a <unk> game that 's in half words and <unk> .
<unk> , at every <unk> <unk> a letter on every <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> a letter on every <unk> , and while I was <unk> <unk> , he was <unk> on a <unk> .
Then , after about 30 seconds , you <unk> , and you have a new <unk> and new <unk> <unk> .
Thank you .
Here 's <unk> children in <unk> <unk> , I 've made so I made them so I 've <unk> them and <unk> a video .
They 're very <unk> .
And one of the interesting things of these kind of <unk> is that you don 't have to give people a lot of <unk> .
I just say , " <unk> of words , " and they know what to do .
Here 's other people who <unk> it .
This is our <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , there .
And actually wanted to be <unk> .
They were just <unk> , for him .
Now , this is a <unk> <unk> .
I wanted to build a <unk> <unk> . He 's <unk> .
It can <unk> new characters in the scene , <unk> their <unk> .
It can <unk> new characters in the scene , <unk> their <unk> .
So , here 's what 's doing .
<unk> : The sun is <unk> .
David <unk> : Now he brought a <unk> in the scene .
<unk> : The <unk> <unk> .
<unk> ! Yeah ! Yeah !
So we <unk> the <unk> and <unk> can <unk> the characters --
<unk> : <unk> !
<unk> your story .
<unk> : <unk> !
<unk> : It 's a story with the open , and it can decide how to <unk> .
<unk> : It 's a story with the open , and it can decide how to <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> away , <unk> .
<unk> : The last example I have time to show you is a <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> music .
It 's a recent <unk> , <unk> <unk> and <unk> music .
The <unk> here are <unk> by <unk> as a <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> of these has four different <unk> , and you can choose which we use .
You can also <unk> these <unk> in a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And I just <unk> by doing a " <unk> " and a <unk> . "
These are effects that you can be alive , like <unk> and <unk> .
I 'm going to <unk> it to a particular sound and then <unk> to <unk> .
And then there are the effects of <unk> and <unk> , which <unk> the entire sequence .
<unk> how it works .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> : <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> : <unk> in a series , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> on the other basis .
Now I 'm going to take a <unk> line .
<unk> : <unk> : I 'm going to <unk> .
<unk> : And I 'm going to <unk> the <unk> , so I can control the effect of live .
<unk> : <unk> : I can <unk> the entire sequence <unk> <unk> and time on one side .
<unk> : And now I 'm going to <unk> the bottom to give more <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> : I can <unk> the <unk> of <unk> .
So I don 't have to <unk> before , but I can <unk> , <unk> <unk> or more <unk> .
And now , finally , I can <unk> the entire <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> .
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is building new <unk> <unk> and more <unk> to how our brain work and body .
And today , I 've had time to show you one of the results of this path , and some <unk> that we try to bring out of the lab .
The concept I want to <unk> is that 's going to <unk> this new generation of objects to <unk> the <unk> media , which <unk> information in our world in the way we want .
Thank you very much .
I don 't see the time I 'm going to talk to all of you .
I 'm a <unk> .
<unk> is my <unk> , but it 's more than that , of course .
It 's also love and <unk> of my life .
And I don 't like that I can change .
But , I said , something that was <unk> in my life and my life , and that led me to me to <unk> the whole relationship with this work .
The particular thing is I <unk> wrote this book , this <unk> called " <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , which , <unk> from my <unk> books , <unk> <unk> .
And the result is that everywhere I 'm going to <unk> now , people like I was <unk> .
<unk> -- <unk> , <unk> !
I 'm going to <unk> and they say , " You don 't fear of being able to be able to do better ?
You don 't fear you have to write about all life can create a book that could <unk> to create a book that could <unk> to someone ? "
<unk> that can <unk> to someone ? "
It 's <unk> , you know .
But it could go worse , <unk> I remember that over 20 years ago , when I was trying to say to people -- a <unk> -- I wanted to be a <unk> .
I 'm going to <unk> the <unk> <unk> from fear .
And people told me , " Don 't you know , you don 't know to be able to be successful ?
You don 't fear the <unk> of <unk> <unk> you ?
You don 't fear to do this <unk> for all of life without anything that anything is ever <unk> and die on a <unk> of <unk> <unk> with the <unk> <unk> mouth <unk> ?
So , you know .
The answer -- the short answer to all these questions is , " Yeah . "
Yeah , I 'm afraid of all those things .
I 've always had fear .
And I 've also <unk> of many other things that people cannot <unk> .
How <unk> and other things <unk> .
But , as it 's about the writing what I thought and <unk> is why ?
Is it <unk> ?
It 's <unk> that anyone who who <unk> <unk> to be <unk> by a job that you feel like you 've been born .
But what 's so particular in the <unk> <unk> <unk> to <unk> health <unk> in a way that other <unk> don 't do ?
Like my father , for example , he was a <unk> and not a <unk> <unk> of once in his <unk> , in his <unk> , where he was asked if she was afraid to be <unk> ?
It was never -- that <unk> of John <unk> , how do you ?
<unk> 't you like that , <unk> ?
<unk> , engineers <unk> like <unk> <unk> <unk> .
We <unk> , we have enough this <unk> , and not only <unk> but <unk> all of these kinds of <unk> , we have this <unk> to be <unk> <unk> .
And he didn 't know that look at the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> that , only in the <unk> century , <unk> young and often for them .
And those who don 't <unk> seem to be really <unk> by their <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , before I would die , in the last <unk> said , " Every book has <unk> me a little bit more amazing <unk> about the work of your life .
But we don 't know when we <unk> it , because we heard these things so long we have to have all so <unk> and <unk> the <unk> that creativity and <unk> are in some way , and <unk> the art , at the end , we always <unk> .
And the question I want to <unk> to all here is : are you <unk> with this idea ?
I 'm going to leave you this thing -- because it 's going to <unk> from a <unk> <unk> to me .
I think it 's <unk> .
And I think it 's also <unk> and I don 't want to <unk> in the next century .
I think it 's better <unk> our great <unk> to live .
And I certainly know , in my case -- it would be very <unk> to start <unk> to <unk> to <unk> to which I 'm in my career .
<unk> -- <unk> look , I 'm pretty young , I 've been about 40 years .
I have about four <unk> of work in me .
And it 's very <unk> that anything that 's going to happen now , it 's going to be <unk> from the world as the work I was <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , because we 're all <unk> friends -- is <unk> that my greatest success is to my <unk> .
Oh , <unk> , thinking !
You know , this is the kind of <unk> that leads a person to start <unk> to the nine of the morning and I don 't want to do it .
I could keep doing this work I love .
So , the question becomes , how ?
And so I think , after many <unk> , that way to work to keep <unk> is what to create a <unk> <unk> , OK ?
I have to find a <unk> distance of security between me , which I 'm <unk> , and my <unk> <unk> on what the <unk> <unk> . And as I would <unk> to get it . And as I 'm going to go through the last year , and to try to find other societies in order to find other societies to see if you have better ideas and more <unk> ideas and more <unk> ideas to see if you have better ideas .
about how to help people <unk> <unk> <unk> of creativity .
And that research led me to <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
<unk> because I was <unk> in <unk> and then <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> -- people don 't believe that creativity <unk> from men , OK ?
It turns out that creativity was this <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> men from some <unk> <unk> and <unk> , for reasons and <unk> .
<unk> <unk> these <unk> <unk> of creativity " <unk> . "
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> to have a <unk> that <unk> <unk> from <unk> .
The <unk> were the same idea , but they <unk> that species of spirit without a <unk> .
which is <unk> , because <unk> didn 't really feel that a <unk> was somebody was particularly smart .
I thought a <unk> was this sort of <unk> <unk> that would be literally <unk> in the <unk> of a <unk> , a little artist , kind of like <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> to <unk> the work of the artist and <unk> the <unk> of that work .
<unk> <unk> , here is the distance of which I 'm talking about -- that <unk> you <unk> you from the results of your work .
And everybody thought it was how we were going to be , right ?
So the artists were <unk> by <unk> things , like <unk> , for example , right ?
If your work was <unk> , you wouldn 't get the <unk> , everybody <unk> that was <unk> by this <unk> <unk> .
If your work <unk> , it wasn 't all your <unk> , right ?
<unk> that was your <unk> to be a <unk> .
And so people <unk> <unk> creativity <unk> creativity for a long time .
Then the <unk> <unk> and <unk> , and we <unk> this great idea ; we <unk> the human <unk> on the center of the universe and the center of the <unk> and the <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and
This was the principle of <unk> <unk> and people were <unk> to think that creativity was completely <unk> by <unk> .
And for the first time in history , <unk> to <unk> this or that artist as a <unk> rather than a person with <unk> .
And I have to <unk> , I think it was a big <unk> .
I think you know , a simple person to believe that you 're like a <unk> like the source , <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> is a <unk> responsibility , <unk> and <unk> and <unk> is a <unk> responsibility .
It 's like to ask someone to <unk> the sun .
<unk> and <unk> completely <unk> the <unk> and create all these <unk> <unk> on the <unk> .
And I think it was this pressure that I 've been <unk> the artists in the <unk> 500 years .
And if this is true , and I think it 's , and I think it 's , and now ?
Can we <unk> it ?
I could go back to a <unk> understanding of <unk> relationship between human and <unk> .
Or maybe not .
Maybe we can 't <unk> 500 years of thinking in an <unk> talk in an <unk> talk .
And there 's probably people in the audience who <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> on the <unk> , <unk> , do you <unk> people <unk> to <unk> their <unk> .
You probably don 't want to tell you about this thing .
But the question I 'd like to <unk> is -- why not ?
Why don 't we <unk> this way ?
Because it has more sense of every other thing I 've ever heard about the <unk> <unk> of <unk> .
A process that , as anyone who ever ever <unk> to do something -- so basically , everybody -- knows , you know , you don 't <unk> .
And in fact , it can be completely <unk> .
I 've done this <unk> <unk> with the amazing <unk> <unk> , who has now 90 years , but it was a <unk> for all of life and told me that during his <unk> <unk> , <unk> out of the <unk> <unk> , <unk> out of the <unk> .
And he said , it was like a <unk> <unk> of air .
And that <unk> <unk> to her from <unk> .
I could get it , because he was <unk> the land below its feet .
I decided to have one thing to do and words at that point and words , " <unk> as a <unk> . "
And so he went to home and <unk> by this <unk> , and it shouldn 't have to <unk> that take a piece of paper and a <unk> enough <unk> , <unk> and <unk> enough to the page .
<unk> , sometimes I couldn 't be <unk> enough , so <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> to <unk> the <unk> through and she would <unk> to <unk> through the <unk> , looking , and she would <unk> through the <unk> , and she would <unk> to her , and she would <unk> to her , " another <unk> . "
Then there were times -- this was never going to <unk> it -- there was no <unk> when you were almost <unk> , OK ?
So , he was starting home and he was looking for the paper and the <unk> through , and he was <unk> , and then he was <unk> , and then he was <unk> , and then he was like to <unk> with the other hand hand and <unk> .
<unk> the <unk> from the tail and <unk> into his body and the <unk> on the page .
And in these cases , the <unk> would be <unk> on the page and <unk> , but <unk> , the <unk> to the <unk> word to the first .
So when you <unk> it -- it 's <unk> , it 's exactly <unk> to my <unk> process .
I don 't have my <unk> process -- I 'm not a <unk> !
I 'm a <unk> , and my way of <unk> is ; I 'm <unk> at the same <unk> every day and work and work and <unk> and work and <unk> on top .
But even my <unk> , I <unk> against that thing , sometimes .
And I 'm sure that many of you <unk> it .
You know , even if the work and ideas I would <unk> to me from a certain source , I couldn 't <unk> .
And what is this thing ?
And how can we <unk> it in a way we don 't <unk> our head , but rather , what would you like to do it , but rather , what would you like to do it ,
And so I 'm <unk> , I 'm going to <unk> <unk> <unk> , which I 've been several years ago for a <unk> .
I 'm talking about this , and you know , <unk> , for the <unk> of life was the <unk> of the <unk> artist , trying to control , <unk> , <unk> these <unk> <unk> species of totally <unk> .
But then <unk> , he was <unk> , and a day as he was <unk> on a <unk> <unk> , <unk> it all for him .
<unk> <unk> , and all of a <unk> <unk> this little <unk> of <unk> , which comes into his head as <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , and <unk> , and you know , and the <unk> , you know , it 's wonderful , and the <unk> , but he doesn 't know how to <unk> .
It doesn 't have a <unk> , it doesn 't have a <unk> , it doesn 't have a <unk> .
So he starts to hear this <unk> species of old <unk> to grow in him , and I 'm going to <unk> , and I 'm going to <unk> from this song .
I 'm not enough <unk> and I can 't <unk> . "
And instead of going to <unk> , <unk> .
<unk> the entire <unk> process and <unk> something completely new .
I just the sky and said , " <unk> , you don 't see I 'm <unk> ? "
" It seems to <unk> that can write a song now ?
If you really want to <unk> , you 're going to get a more <unk> when I can take care of you .
<unk> , <unk> to <unk> more more today .
<unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> . "
And his <unk> process , <unk> after this .
Not the work , the work was still <unk> as always .
But the process , and the <unk> <unk> that was <unk> when he was <unk> when he <unk> , the <unk> that outside he had to be <unk> , and he <unk> it from where he had to be , he thought he had to be a <unk> and <unk> .
but I was <unk> this <unk> , <unk> <unk> a conversation between <unk> and this thing that was <unk> and <unk> , but it wasn 't <unk> .
So , how much the story I 'm going to change a little bit , the way I 'm <unk> and already <unk> me once .
This idea , I was when I was <unk> " <unk> , <unk> , " and I was in one of the <unk> of the <unk> that we 're all working on something and you can 't think that you can be a <unk> , that 's going to be the <unk> book .
Not just <unk> , the <unk> book .
And I started thinking about <unk> this project .
But then I 'm going to try and <unk> the air and <unk> us .
So I <unk> my face on the <unk> and <unk> my <unk> to a <unk> of the room .
And I said to <unk> , " <unk> , what , both we know that if this book is not going to be <unk> , right ?
Because as you see , I 'm <unk> all I have , I don 't have more than that .
So if you want it to be better , you have to <unk> and do your <unk> .
OK . But if you don 't do it , you know what , I don 't do it .
I started writing the same because it 's my work .
And I 'd like to <unk> that I 'm <unk> to me to do my part " Because it 's so , then it 's in the end , OK -- <unk> does in the <unk> of Africa <unk> the people <unk> to the <unk> of the moon , music <unk> and <unk> that <unk> hours to <unk> .
And they were always <unk> , because the <unk> were <unk> and were <unk> .
But every long , I would say , something <unk> , and one of these <unk> artists actually <unk> .
And I know you know what I 'm talking about , because I know you 've all seen it , at a certain <unk> .
It was like if time <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> through a kind of <unk> and he wasn 't doing anything different from usually , like <unk> <unk> before , but everything was <unk> .
And all of a sudden , not just like a human .
But it <unk> from the <unk> and below the <unk> of <unk> .
And when this <unk> , at time , people would <unk> what was , he <unk> it with his name .
<unk> and <unk> <unk> , " <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , God , God , " " " . "
That 's God , you know .
<unk> note -- when the <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> this <unk> with them and <unk> <unk> in <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , which you can still hear in the <unk> or in <unk> .
In <unk> , when an artist did something impossible and <unk> , " <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , " <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , " <unk> , <unk> -- a <unk> of God .
And it 's <unk> because we need it .
But the problem comes after day , for the <unk> itself , when you <unk> and <unk> that are 11 of the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> it of God is no longer .
It 's simply a <unk> with a lot of <unk> <unk> , and maybe never <unk> to that <unk> .
And maybe nobody <unk> the name of God as I 'm still <unk> , and what 's going to do with the rest of his life ?
It 's hard .
This is one of the most <unk> <unk> to do in a <unk> life .
But maybe it 's not to be so <unk> if you can 't believe , <unk> , that the most <unk> of your being come from you .
But you just know that you 're just <unk> from a <unk> source of this <unk> part of your life that you have to go to <unk> when you 're finished .
And , you know , if we think about this way changes .
And so I started <unk> , and it 's certainly how I 've <unk> it for several months during the <unk> of the book that was <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> of my success .
And what I have to keep <unk> when I feel <unk> from this is , I don 't fear .
I don 't want to just your work .
<unk> to <unk> for your side , any could be .
If your work is <unk> , <unk> .
If you <unk> , you 'll <unk> <unk> to you <unk> <unk> some kind of <unk> , for one moment through your <unk> , then " <unk> ! "
<unk> , you do the same your <unk> .
And " <unk> ! " <unk> to yourself .
I think and I 'm going to <unk> .
" <unk> ! " <unk> ! " <unk> you , only for having had love and <unk> <unk> <unk> by <unk> <unk> .
Thank you .
Thank you .
<unk> <unk> : <unk> !
As you know , I 've already talked about some of these projects on human genome , what it can <unk> and discovery of new genes .
Now we 're <unk> a new path : we started <unk> biology and now starting from that digital code , we 're <unk> in a new <unk> of biology , <unk> and <unk> and <unk> life .
We 've always been trying to <unk> big questions .
" <unk> is life ? " It 's something that many <unk> , I think they 've been <unk> to <unk> at various levels .
We tried several <unk> , <unk> to the <unk> terms .
We 're <unk> for about 20 years now .
When we <unk> the human genome <unk> to go from the <unk> world of biology in the digital world .
Now we can <unk> the life , or to create new life from this digital universe ?
This is a map of a little <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , which is the <unk> species from the <unk> genome between what can <unk> in the lab .
And we tried to reduce <unk> the genome to <unk> a even smaller .
We 're able to <unk> a <unk> of <unk> genes that are here .
But when we take a look at his <unk> map , it 's <unk> simple than our .
<unk> , this is simple .
But when we look at all the genes we can <unk> , one at a time , is very <unk> that this can bring to a <unk> cell .
So I thought the only way to <unk> was <unk> this <unk> so that we could <unk> the <unk> to <unk> some of these questions .
And so we started the <unk> " Can we <unk> a <unk> ? "
Can the chemistry <unk> to produce these big molecules that we 've never been able to create before ?
And in case , <unk> , can we make a <unk> ?
A <unk> is simply a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The speed we are able to <unk> life is <unk> to <unk> .
Our <unk> to write the code , instead of <unk> , but it 's <unk> .
And our <unk> results that <unk> <unk> <unk> .
We 've been over 15 years ago .
The process has <unk> a lot of <unk> , <unk> with a <unk> before we <unk> the first experiments .
But we found that DNA <unk> is very difficult .
There are <unk> of thousands of cars in the world that <unk> small <unk> of DNA , <unk> <unk> , and it 's a <unk> process : more <unk> is a <unk> process : the <unk> is , more <unk> there are .
So we had to develop a new <unk> to <unk> these <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
And this was our first <unk> , starting from digital information of <unk> genome of <unk> <unk> .
It 's a small virus that bacteria <unk> bacteria .
We designed <unk> , we <unk> the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> a DNA <unk> of about <unk> <unk> .
The interesting part is when we have taken this piece of <unk> <unk> and <unk> it in bacteria , the bacteria have <unk> to read this code and <unk> particles .
The <unk> particles have been <unk> by the cells , are <unk> back and <unk> <unk> <unk> .
I talked about recently with members of the <unk> industry that they have certainly <unk> this model .
They have more than you .
And I think this is a situation where software can actually build his same <unk> in a <unk> system .
But I 'm going to do the greatest .
I wanted to build the entire <unk> of <unk> .
I 'm more than <unk> <unk> <unk> code .
So we thought we were <unk> in <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> , so we can change the <unk> to understand what the <unk> of a <unk> cell .
<unk> is <unk> , and if you <unk> information with a computer , these must be very <unk> .
When we <unk> this genome for the first time in <unk> the standard <unk> was a <unk> for every 10 <unk> <unk> .
We found , <unk> , <unk> <unk> . If we were able to use that original sequence .
One of the process is to design <unk> 50 <unk> that <unk> with all the other <unk> <unk> 50 <unk> to build smaller <unk> than <unk> together .
I 'm going to show here .
You probably read that <unk> us of <unk> .
So we have a <unk> code <unk> on four <unk> : A , <unk> , <unk> and <unk>
<unk> of those <unk> <unk> <unk> together about 20 <unk> , and there 's a <unk> order to <unk> every <unk> .
So we can use the code for <unk> words , <unk> , <unk> .
What we did at the beginning was <unk> .
Some of them were <unk> by the fact that it wasn 't <unk> .
We designed these <unk> to just <unk> with <unk> .
There are <unk> that we <unk> them and <unk> them .
And we started <unk> <unk> , <unk> with <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> .
At every step we have produced these <unk> in <unk> so that we can <unk> that we 're trying to create a very <unk> <unk> as you 'll see in a minute .
We 're trying to <unk> the process .
So this seems to be the <unk> of a <unk> <unk> .
When you start to these <unk> <unk> , more than 100 <unk> <unk> , you don 't get <unk> directly to the <unk> <unk> .
You get to the <unk> of <unk> <unk> biology .
So we have <unk> other <unk> .
<unk> of another <unk> called <unk> <unk> , which biology <unk> to <unk> DNA <unk> to DNA <unk> to DNA <unk> .
Here 's one example .
This <unk> , called <unk> <unk> , can <unk> three million <unk> .
You can see in the <unk> <unk> like his <unk> is being <unk> .
In 12 hours -- it 's been <unk> exactly as it was before .
<unk> thousands of organisms that are able to do it .
These organisms can completely <unk> .
I would like to live under <unk> .
I 'm absolutely sure that life <unk> in space , and <unk> <unk> to find new <unk> of water .
In fact , NASA 's shown that this is happening .
This is an image of the <unk> that we built these <unk> , just by simply using these <unk> with design <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> <unk> them .
This is not <unk> with a <unk> <unk> , but with a <unk> <unk> .
It 's such a <unk> that we can <unk> with a <unk> <unk> .
These are pictures that <unk> a time of about six seconds .
This is the <unk> we 've done a little time ago .
They 're more than <unk> <unk> code .
It 's the biggest <unk> of a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
It has a <unk> <unk> <unk> to 300 million .
If you <unk> it with a <unk> 10 without , we would just take pages to <unk> this code .
Now , how do we make it work ? How can we <unk> it ?
<unk> , through a virus is a game that 's a kids .
It 's a little bit more <unk> when you use of bacteria .
It 's more simple when it comes to the <unk> cells like our : you can just <unk> the <unk> and <unk> another , which is that basically the <unk> process .
In <unk> <unk> , the <unk> is instead <unk> into the cell , but we have <unk> <unk> that we are able to do a <unk> <unk> from one cell to another cell to <unk> .
We <unk> a <unk> <unk> from a <unk> species .
<unk> are different than men from <unk> .
We 've <unk> some <unk> <unk> in more <unk> way we could decide which to <unk> .
<unk> it with <unk> so that we <unk> all the <unk> .
And when we put it in the cell was <unk> and <unk> our <unk> the new <unk> went into the cell .
And I would say we don 't want to go beyond , but we 've been trying to <unk> more <unk> .
This is one of the biggest <unk> of evolution .
We found that <unk> species <unk> a second or a third or a third <unk> somewhere , <unk> in a second thousands of new <unk> to the species .
So who thinks about evolution as one <unk> at a time that <unk> has not understand a lot of biology .
<unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> of <unk> that <unk> DNA .
The <unk> that was in the cell didn 't <unk> one .
The <unk> <unk> we <unk> it has <unk> .
It 's <unk> , and he <unk> the other <unk> as <unk> , <unk> it , and we have <unk> with only the cell and the new <unk> .
has become blue because of the genes we have <unk> .
And in a short <unk> of time , all of the <unk> of a species are <unk> , and <unk> of all over a new species , <unk> on the new software that we <unk> in the cell .
All <unk> are <unk> , and when you <unk> the code <unk> , and when you <unk> the code <unk> exactly what we 've <unk> you .
Now , this could look <unk> , but by <unk> the software we can change things in a fairly <unk> .
Now , I 've already <unk> that 's not talking about <unk> -- but from progress from three million years and a half million years , and I 've already said maybe we 're about to create a new version of <unk> <unk> , where we <unk> new species <unk> on this process .
Why do that ?
I think it 's pretty <unk> when we think of our <unk> .
We 're going to go from six and a half billion people in the next 40 years .
Just to give one example : I was born in <unk> .
Now there are three people on the planet to <unk> in <unk> ; there 's four years , there 's going to be four .
We 're <unk> now to find food , water and <unk> and <unk> , <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> , <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> , <unk> and <unk> and <unk> , <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> , <unk> and <unk> and a half billion people .
I could get to do it for nine billion .
<unk> more than five billion <unk> , more than 30 billion <unk> .
That means percent million <unk> a day .
When we try to find <unk> <unk> , or any kind of process to <unk> , will be a huge challenge .
In more we have to realize that all the CO2 <unk> from these materials that <unk> in the atmosphere .
At day , I think of the <unk> <unk> all over the world , we have a <unk> with about 20 million genes , and I like to think that are the <unk> <unk> for the future .
The <unk> <unk> is only about a <unk> , and think about how many different things are outside .
Our <unk> here are <unk> data from the <unk> reality and our imagination .
Now we have <unk> , through these <unk> <unk> <unk> , able to create what we call <unk> <unk> .
We 're able to build a <unk> robot that can produce a million <unk> a day .
Think of <unk> these 20 million genes or <unk> or <unk> to <unk> <unk> or <unk> , new <unk> , new <unk> , can <unk> through a small team , and to create more <unk> biology now that over the last 20 years of science .
And it 's simply a standard <unk> .
We can choose to <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> or <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
This is a <unk> of some software <unk> that we 're working on to be able to <unk> and design and <unk> species .
Well , we don 't know how they will be .
We know exactly how their <unk> code .
We 're <unk> on the <unk> <unk> generation .
You 've also seen that <unk> from the <unk> was an experiment .
We have <unk> second and third generation that we had enough soon <unk> <unk> <unk> as <unk> or different kinds of <unk> .
But the only way biology can have a great impact without <unk> food as food as food as <unk> , and we would <unk> the CO2 as food as we 're working on to design that can achieve this purpose , and we can think we have this <unk> to <unk> in about 18 months .
<unk> <unk> with CO2 is a <unk> , but in our <unk> <unk> around the world , we 've found different <unk> .
This is a <unk> that we <unk> in <unk> .
It <unk> in the deep ocean , at about <unk> feet deep deep on temperature .
<unk> <unk> from CO2 using hydrogen <unk> as hydrogen <unk> as <unk> as source .
We 're trying to understand if we can <unk> CO2 , which can easily be <unk> through <unk> , <unk> CO2 in <unk> , to drive this process .
So , we think we can be able to <unk> what the basic question is that we , " is , " is , " We , we have the <unk> goal of <unk> the entire industry .
<unk> . If you can 't do it from TED , where can you get ?
<unk> a main source of energy .
<unk> , we 're working on using <unk> to create <unk> <unk> .
You saw this year with flu , we 're always <unk> back a year and with a dollar in less when it 's about finding the right <unk> .
I think what you can change by building <unk> <unk> .
Here 's how the future could start to look <unk> , now , the tree of evolution , <unk> evolution with bacteria , <unk> and finally cells .
We 're in so much , to <unk> people .
Our purpose is to make a long enough to try to live enough for <unk> . Thank you very much .
<unk> I 'm going to show you , the <unk> possible , some <unk> work , some fundamental , of the new technology that we 've taken <unk> to a <unk> almost a year ago . This is <unk> .
It 's a environment that you can <unk> in both at the local level that <unk> with a huge amount of data .
Here we 're seeing <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> with a kind of <unk> <unk> and <unk> , for a quick <unk> , <unk> the images as we want .
And it doesn 't matter how big the amount of information that we see , how big it are these <unk> of data or <unk> .
Most of them are <unk> photographs , but this is a <unk> <unk> from the <unk> of <unk> , and <unk> in the <unk> of 300 <unk> .
It doesn 't make any difference because the only thing that <unk> the <unk> of a system like this is the number of <unk> on your screen in any time . It 's also a very <unk> architecture .
This is a whole book , example of data , not images .
This is the <unk> <unk> <unk> . Every <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And to <unk> that it 's just about <unk> and not images , we can do something like that , to actually see that it 's a real <unk> of the text , not of a picture .
It could be a way of <unk> to read a book .
I don 't tell you .
This is a more <unk> example . This is a number of The <unk> .
Every image is the beginning of a <unk> .
And it really gives you the pleasure and the experience of read the real version of a <unk> or a <unk> , which is for nature a <unk> <unk> .
We also did something with the corner of this particular number of The <unk> .
We created a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of what you use in a normal <unk> , and we 've <unk> you have <unk> content .
If you want to see the <unk> of this <unk> , you can see it here .
Or even other models , or even <unk> <unk> .
And this is really <unk> some of these ideas to <unk> the <unk> of space on the screen .
I 'm going to put it to <unk> and other <unk> <unk> , not to be <unk> .
Of course , the <unk> is one of the most <unk> <unk> for this kind of technology .
And on this , I don 't want to lose time , if we don 't say we have <unk> <unk> to be able to give it in this field .
These are all the streets in the <unk> <unk> on a NASA <unk> image .
So I 'm going to start with something else .
This is actually actually live on the Web ; you can see you can see it .
It 's a project called <unk> , which <unk> two different technologies .
One is <unk> and the other is a <unk> <unk> <unk> , which is a very interesting <unk> that was made by <unk> <unk> , a <unk> student of Washington , with the <unk> <unk> of <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And it 's live on the web , <unk> by <unk> .
You can <unk> when we do this kind of <unk> , where we can go from an image to the other and have this kind of experience <unk> .
But the <unk> <unk> of images here actually actually have a sense .
So , the <unk> <unk> of the computer <unk> these images together , so that they <unk> all <unk> <unk> <unk> on the <unk> <unk> <unk> on the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> have been <unk> . Here you see some <unk> <unk> <unk> , or <unk> <unk> , and these things are all <unk> at the <unk> level .
I don 't know if I have time to show you some more environment .
There are much more <unk> .
I want to go directly to one of the <unk> of <unk> data and this <unk> from a <unk> <unk> that we 've done for the first time , I 'm going to show you what <unk> is really the key behind this technology , the <unk> technology . And it 's not <unk> by <unk> by looking at the <unk> we have put in the website .
We had to <unk> some <unk> and <unk> .
This is a <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> and <unk> images of types of <unk> in <unk> , other <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> . And he <unk> of these <unk> <unk> <unk> a picture . He <unk> <unk> <unk> a picture .
So they 're all <unk> images from <unk> and have all <unk> <unk> on this way .
And it 's possible to <unk> this way <unk> .
You know , I would never have thought of <unk> , I would have never thought to work for <unk> .
It 's very <unk> to <unk> this kind of <unk> here .
I think we wanted to see that it 's a lot of different types of <unk> : from the <unk> <unk> , a <unk> number , <unk> , a <unk> number , <unk> with this environment .
And if I can , I can <unk> <unk> to <unk> those <unk> .
Many of them are <unk> by <unk> , etc . .
<unk> here is a series of photographs -- <unk> .
This is a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
We can go from the <unk> to the physics of this environment .
The <unk> point is that we can do things with social environment . This is now <unk> from <unk> <unk> from the whole memory of how we <unk> the earth , from the <unk> <unk> , from the <unk> of <unk> <unk> and <unk> all those data together .
All of those pictures become <unk> together , more than the <unk> .
You have a <unk> model of the entire <unk> <unk> .
Think of this as <unk> of the work of <unk> <unk> <unk> on Earth .
It 's something that <unk> in <unk> <unk> as people as <unk> , and which <unk> for who <unk> it with the use .
Their pictures are <unk> with <unk> <unk> by other people .
If somebody 's being the idea of <unk> all of these <unk> <unk> the name , my picture of <unk> <unk> <unk> , you know , my picture of <unk> <unk> , you can <unk> that <unk> to <unk> in that space , by using the <unk> of anybody else , and have a social experience <unk> and <unk> .
Of course , a <unk> of all this is extremely <unk> models of every interesting part of the land , <unk> not just by <unk> <unk> and images and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> , but <unk> memory .
Thank you very much .
Chris Anderson : I understand ? What 's good what your software your <unk> will allow us to do is that at a certain point , in the next few years , all the photographs <unk> from anyone in the world 's entire <unk> <unk> <unk> ?
<unk> : Yeah . What 's doing is basically , what 's doing is basically <unk> .
It 's creating <unk> , if you want , in images .
And it 's <unk> it 's <unk> to the content of images .
And the thing becomes very interesting if you think of the <unk> of <unk> information that many of these <unk> images .
As you do a <unk> of images on the web , you <unk> a <unk> and the text on the page has a lot of information about images .
Now , what if that picture would <unk> <unk> to all your pictures ?
So the amount of <unk> <unk> and the amount of <unk> that 's really enormous . It 's a <unk> effect .
CA : <unk> , it 's really incredible . <unk> .
<unk> : I 'm going to tell you very much .
One of the main <unk> when you <unk> and one of the <unk> research is to be able to live in who has no <unk> <unk> , among who <unk> the <unk> <unk> , <unk> the past in the <unk> of the <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> to think that <unk> <unk> <unk> still beyond the <unk> <unk> , or the <unk> <unk> are still <unk> of <unk> , or <unk> , <unk> <unk> still the <unk> of <unk> , to <unk> the <unk> of <unk> , and that the idea that the world in which we don 't exist in <unk> sense , but it 's only a reality of reality ,
the <unk> of a particular <unk> of <unk> choices that our <unk> has done , or evil , many <unk> ago .
And of course , all <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
<unk> . <unk> <unk> .
We 're <unk> to <unk> .
We have to <unk> the death <unk> , so we don 't <unk> it to <unk> and <unk> --
We all have an art .
What 's the <unk> is the <unk> of the song , the <unk> of every culture .
It doesn 't matter that matter the <unk> of <unk> , or the <unk> of <unk> , or the <unk> of <unk> <unk> , or the <unk> <unk> <unk> , or a <unk> in the heart of <unk> .
He was my <unk> of journey in <unk> a month ago , or a <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> , on the <unk> , the <unk> mother of the world .
All of these <unk> are <unk> us that there are other ways of <unk> other ways of moving in the world .
And if you take a second , it 's a concept that can give you hope .
<unk> , <unk> <unk> of the world create a <unk> <unk> life and <unk> the planet , and it 's important for the <unk> of the planet as the <unk> <unk> <unk> known as <unk> known known known as <unk> known known as <unk> known known as <unk> .
And you can think of this <unk> <unk> as a <unk> and you can <unk> the <unk> total of all the <unk> , dreams , <unk> , ideas , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> in being by the <unk> of the human imagination .
<unk> is the <unk> of humanity .
It 's the <unk> of what we are and what we can be as <unk> species .
And <unk> <unk> was <unk> <unk> <unk> was successful at <unk> and <unk> much faster .
<unk> , for example , <unk> that 50 percent of all species has been or is on the <unk> of <unk> , just because it 's <unk> , or -- in the <unk> <unk> -- in the field of diversity -- and you don 't even even get to <unk> <unk> -- that 's the <unk> diversity .
The <unk> of this is , of course , the <unk> <unk> .
When you 're <unk> <unk> <unk> on this planet .
A language is not just a <unk> or a <unk> or a series of <unk> rules .
A language is the <unk> of the human spirit .
It 's the middle with which the <unk> of every culture comes into the world .
Every language is a forest of mind , a <unk> , a thought , a <unk> of <unk> .
And of those <unk> <unk> , while we 're sitting here in <unk> , at least half is no longer <unk> in the <unk> of children .
It 's no longer <unk> to children , which means , unless you <unk> something , which is already death .
What 's more <unk> than being <unk> by <unk> , to be the last to talk a language , of not <unk> the <unk> of <unk> or <unk> the <unk> of <unk> or <unk> the <unk> of <unk> or <unk> the <unk> of <unk> ?
This <unk> <unk> was the state of somebody in the world every two weeks : every two weeks a <unk> <unk> and <unk> with it in the <unk> <unk> <unk> of a <unk> <unk> .
And I know some of you know , " <unk> 't it better ?
The world would not be a better place if we all have the same language ? " <unk> , then we all talk about <unk> .
<unk> <unk> .
<unk> of a <unk> thing that means you can 't talk about your own language .
I 'd like to show you today to make you a journey through the <unk> --
a small journey in the <unk> to give you a <unk> of what we 're <unk> .
A lot of us <unk> that when I say " different ways of <unk> . " I mean , " I really think a different ways of <unk> .
<unk> for example this <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , the <unk> of <unk> , which <unk> to the <unk> of <unk> <unk> from the river <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
It 's a <unk> that 's not able to <unk> the blue color from green because the green is <unk> in the time of the forest , which we <unk> the <unk> .
They have a <unk> language and a <unk> rule , <unk> " <unk> <unk> " : you have to <unk> a person who talks a different language .
And all this <unk> in the past <unk> , but the <unk> is that in these <unk> families that you 're talking six or seven <unk> because of <unk> <unk> anybody 's <unk> anybody 's <unk> .
You start to hear and then I started talking .
I 've been <unk> one of the most interesting <unk> I 've lived with , the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , an amazing <unk> that had the first <unk> in <unk> .
In <unk> , five <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
They made <unk> from the top photographs that <unk> them in <unk> that <unk> <unk> , which this <unk> of the <unk> forest had never seen anything .
They <unk> the <unk> <unk> , and they <unk> them to <unk> a form or a <unk> and , not <unk> , they <unk> <unk> , and they didn 't <unk> anything , they <unk> the five <unk> with <unk> .
But <unk> not just <unk> <unk> .
They 're <unk> with each other .
<unk> percent of <unk> <unk> was <unk> by themselves .
We 're <unk> to eight <unk> and found two <unk> and we found two <unk> <unk> and when we <unk> to know , they <unk> that one of them was <unk> so that he died , and then they <unk> it . And then they <unk> it .
<unk> were able to recognize the animal <unk> from 40 <unk> and <unk> the species .
I was early ' <unk> , I was a very interesting job when my <unk> <unk> <unk> me if I wanted to go to <unk> in <unk> , if I wanted to go to <unk> between <unk> societies to the base of <unk> and <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
To make sense of <unk> , I should have understand <unk> culture and that <unk> is not <unk> .
It 's pretty much about a <unk> view of the world .
Very interesting .
If you tell you about <unk> the great <unk> of the world , what would you like ?
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , etc . .
A continent is always <unk> out , thinking that <unk> Africa has no <unk> . And yes , you know , and the <unk> is not another one of these <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> during the <unk> <unk> .
What makes the <unk> interesting is the <unk> relationship between life and death .
So <unk> do <unk> <unk> .
<unk> can be <unk> by the <unk> <unk> , <unk> to the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> <unk> to live in a way that for a second second , the <unk> becomes the <unk> .
So , the <unk> <unk> to say " <unk> <unk> go to <unk> God .
We <unk> in <unk> and <unk> God . "
And from the moment that you 're <unk> , is the spirit that <unk> you , how do you <unk> ?
So , it <unk> to these incredible events : <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a fairly strong <unk> of the power of mind when it 's <unk> in a state of <unk> <unk> .
I 've lived all the <unk> I 've lived with the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , in <unk> .
<unk> of <unk> civilization <unk> that once <unk> on the <unk> of <unk> in <unk> , the <unk> <unk> on the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> on the <unk> <unk> .
In a continent <unk> of blood , this <unk> has never been <unk> by <unk> .
<unk> today I 'm <unk> by a <unk> but their <unk> is extraordinary .
The young <unk> <unk> from <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> for 18 years , and they live in a world <unk> and <unk> <unk> to the <unk> <unk> <unk> for 18 years .
Two <unk> <unk> <unk> .
For all this time , they 're <unk> to the values of their society , <unk> that they <unk> their <unk> and only their <unk> <unk> <unk> -- or to say the <unk> <unk> .
At the end of this incredible <unk> , they <unk> out and for the first time in their life , they see an <unk> . And in that moment of <unk> <unk> , when the sun <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> , when the sun <unk> <unk> , all that they have in the <unk> theory , the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , everything that they have been <unk> in theory and he says ,
" <unk> ? I 'm going to tell you .
It 's <unk> . Now it 's now <unk> to you . "
They 're called <unk> and they say that we , <unk> <unk> , we are the <unk> of the world 's <unk> .
This level is extremely important .
When we think about <unk> <unk> and the <unk> <unk> and the old story of <unk> <unk> , which is a concept in its <unk> or maybe <unk> <unk> and <unk> and say that these <unk> are closer to Earth than us .
<unk> <unk> are not <unk> or <unk> by <unk> .
There 's not space for these things in the <unk> of <unk> or <unk> <unk> , but through time and <unk> , they created a <unk> of Earth , created a <unk> of Earth , they 've created a <unk> of the Earth ,
What does that mean ?
I mean that a <unk> of the <unk> that <unk> the mountain is a <unk> spirit that <unk> its <unk> will be <unk> human being <unk> , and it will have a <unk> different <unk> , and it will have a <unk> with the mountain or the <unk> that place that <unk> a mountain is a <unk> to be <unk> .
which is a <unk> of a spirit or a <unk> is <unk> .
What 's interesting is the <unk> that <unk> the relationship between <unk> and natural world .
I grew up in the <unk> of <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> to be <unk> .
And that made me a human being different from my <unk> friends who believe that <unk> are the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> <unk> of <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> that live in the <unk> <unk> of the world , <unk> that were <unk> in the <unk> <unk> .
If we start <unk> that these <unk> can actually create different , we could start to understand some of the <unk> <unk> .
I 've <unk> this picture in <unk> in <unk> <unk> .
Maybe some of you have heard about <unk> , the most powerful <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
What makes the <unk> is not the potential of <unk> , but its <unk> . It 's <unk> by two things .
On one side , this <unk> <unk> <unk> a series of <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
<unk> the only <unk> <unk> a little bit of <unk> , but it 's <unk> with the <unk> of a family , but it 's <unk> with the <unk> of a <unk> <unk> said .
This <unk> <unk> <unk> , very similar to <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
If you 're going to see <unk> <unk> on <unk> <unk> , the <unk> that are <unk> from a different <unk> of species , it <unk> it .
<unk> that <unk> on the <unk> is a bit of like being <unk> by a <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> on a sea of electricity . <unk> 't create a <unk> of reality . It doesn 't create the <unk> of reality .
I often had my <unk> , Richard <unk> , the man who <unk> was <unk> , with his discovery of <unk> <unk> in the ' <unk> .
I think I can 't <unk> these <unk> as you would <unk> it because if you 're done you can 't tell anybody to be <unk> . <unk> 't be <unk> because they 're <unk> from a <unk> that 's <unk> , you can 't be <unk> because they 're <unk> by a <unk> that 's <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
It 's possible to <unk> only if you could <unk> with other <unk> <unk> .
Now it 's the beautiful one : the <unk> that are <unk> , the same kind of <unk> , <unk> <unk> . The question <unk> <unk> : in a <unk> of <unk> species of plants , how these <unk> <unk> <unk> two <unk> , they don 't similar to that , but if you <unk> in this way , they create a <unk> version that 's <unk> that 's <unk> on the <unk> ?
We use the great <unk> of <unk> and <unk> , which can <unk> .
But if you go to the <unk> , " <unk> " <unk> " . "
What does that mean ?
This <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , which <unk> <unk> in the forest , and our eyes <unk> in the same species .
If you <unk> their <unk> <unk> us , " <unk> " <unk> " <unk> " <unk> " <unk> " <unk> " <unk> " No . "
The solution is : they take <unk> <unk> in a night , <unk> <unk> and <unk> with a different <unk> .
And with this is not <unk> <unk> , but it 's much more interesting than <unk> <unk> .
Now , it 's the problem is that those of us who have <unk> <unk> them , but somehow <unk> to <unk> the <unk> of history of our real <unk> , and <unk> to <unk> of our real world , and <unk> .
In fact , the <unk> century , in 300 years , not <unk> <unk> for his <unk> or his <unk> <unk> , but rather like , the <unk> was where we <unk> and <unk> or <unk> <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> diversity and <unk> and <unk> . <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> or <unk> the planet . Now , it 's not the change .
All <unk> through the <unk> have been <unk> in a <unk> for new <unk> .
And the problem is not technology .
<unk> <unk> have no <unk> to be <unk> when they put <unk> <unk> and <unk> as <unk> have <unk> when they <unk> have <unk> <unk> when they put <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
It 's not the change or technology that <unk> the <unk> of <unk> . It 's the power .
The <unk> <unk> of <unk> .
And if you look at the world , you know , you know , you 're not <unk> to <unk> .
They 're <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> out of existence by <unk> forces that go beyond their <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> --
a <unk> <unk> <unk> , which <unk> <unk> <unk> , a <unk> that lived in the forest to a generation of <unk> , and now <unk> to the <unk> and <unk> on the <unk> of the <unk> , where you can see the river <unk> <unk> from the <unk> that seems to <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> , where the <unk> <unk> <unk> , where the <unk> <unk> <unk> , where the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> ,
I started <unk> the <unk> with the <unk> <unk> to the forest .
Or , in <unk> case , are the disease that are <unk> with the <unk> discovery .
If you put <unk> on the <unk> , where I 'm doing a lot of research , you 'll see the <unk> of the <unk> of politics .
As <unk> <unk> , <unk> physics of a <unk> , is <unk> at the <unk> level , but <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> , not only is <unk> , but <unk> <unk> in certain <unk> , because it 's part of the development .
And you can 't understand the <unk> of the <unk> until you start .
I went from <unk> miles from <unk> in China through the <unk> <unk> , <unk> with a young <unk> , but only <unk> to <unk> , I understood what the <unk> behind .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> million people <unk> from the <unk> during the <unk> <unk> .
The father of this guy was <unk> at <unk> <unk> .
which means that it was <unk> at the time of Chinese <unk> .
<unk> <unk> is <unk> with <unk> <unk> during the <unk> who led the <unk> in <unk> .
My mother was <unk> and his <unk> was being <unk> .
It was taken of <unk> in <unk> at age age two <unk> , <unk> his <unk> because he couldn 't have live without him .
The <unk> , who did the same , was <unk> in <unk> .
One day he <unk> a <unk> <unk> and <unk> , for this <unk> , was <unk> to work for seven years .
The <unk> of <unk> can be <unk> , but the <unk> of <unk> is by present .
<unk> , all <unk> to a choice .
<unk> to live in the <unk> world or we want to <unk> the <unk> world of diversity ?
The great <unk> <unk> <unk> , before he died said that his greatest fear was that , in our <unk> to go to this <unk> <unk> view of the world 's imagination , not only <unk> the whole <unk> of the <unk> <unk> of thought , but a day we <unk> us from a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that there were other possibility .
And it 's <unk> to <unk> that our species has been <unk> for <unk> years .
The <unk> <unk> , who gave us <unk> , which <unk> us to the <unk> of <unk> , <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> with the <unk> of <unk> , creating the <unk> of <unk> , and we talk about <unk> years ago .
The <unk> world has <unk> 300 years .
That <unk> story , I 'm not <unk> that we have the answers to all the challenges that we <unk> in <unk> to come .
When these <unk> <unk> of the world is asked what it means to be human , <unk> with <unk> different <unk> .
And it 's in these answers that we all <unk> the chance of being what we are : a <unk> species , which must be <unk> and all the <unk> can <unk> . And there are great moments of <unk> .
I <unk> this picture on the <unk> <unk> <unk> , when I went to <unk> <unk> with <unk> , and this man , <unk> me , <unk> the wonderful man of his <unk> .
The <unk> government was not always <unk> with the <unk> <unk> and in the <unk> <unk> our <unk> , we <unk> them in <unk> .
The <unk> of this man <unk> <unk> .
The family , <unk> for his life , <unk> the <unk> away all of his <unk> , and all of his <unk> .
You want to know that <unk> don 't <unk> the cold , <unk> .
The <unk> of <unk> were made of fish <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> of this man did not <unk> or <unk> .
It 's <unk> away , it 's <unk> <unk> , and <unk> in your hand . When I did it <unk> , they <unk> it , it <unk> it <unk> it .
He <unk> <unk> on the <unk> of this <unk> of <unk> and when <unk> <unk> , <unk> a dog .
He <unk> the dog and created a <unk> , with the <unk> <unk> created a <unk> , has <unk> another dog , and it 's <unk> on the <unk> , <unk> <unk> in <unk> .
<unk> to talk about <unk> ? <unk> . And that , in different ways , [ <unk> ] is the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> and all the <unk> <unk> of the world .
<unk> <unk> the <unk> government <unk> to <unk> control of an area of larger <unk> than California and <unk> <unk> together .
It 's their new <unk> . It 's called <unk> .
It 's a <unk> <unk> . It 's <unk> all the <unk> resources .
One example of how a <unk> can <unk> with his <unk> .
And , I think it 's pretty <unk> at least who 's been in these <unk> areas of the planet , <unk> that they 're not not <unk> at all .
For somebody is home .
<unk> <unk> of human imagination that <unk> to <unk> . And for us all , the dreams of these children , like the dreams of our children , as the <unk> of hope .
<unk> , we <unk> <unk> we are <unk> that <unk> never never <unk> .
I would say the <unk> --
[ <unk> ] [ <unk> ] but we believe that stories can change the world , and maybe we are the best <unk> to tell the stories of the world . Every month our website <unk> million <unk> . Every month our website <unk> million <unk> .
<unk> <unk> : <unk> our <unk> <unk> .
Our <unk> are <unk> by millions of people .
Our work is <unk> in <unk> to bring our public in <unk> places that <unk> from which <unk> from which <unk> <unk> from how they saw and , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , the <unk> world of <unk> in diversity , and we need to find a <unk> <unk> in a <unk> world .
where the <unk> of all <unk> can <unk> to our <unk> <unk> .
Thank you .
I 'm going to talk about some of the things I 've written in this book that I hope you 've heard and <unk> a few <unk> , in case you don 't .
I 'd like to start with what I call " <unk> . "
The <unk> of what ?
The <unk> <unk> of all <unk> societies . The <unk> <unk> <unk> : " If we want to <unk> <unk> of our <unk> citizens " " . "
The reason is , on one side , in fact that freedom is in itself , is <unk> , <unk> , <unk> for human beings .
<unk> else is in fact that if we are <unk> , each of us can <unk> to do everything that <unk> our <unk> , without anybody who 's going to <unk> our <unk> , without anybody who 's going to have .
The way to <unk> freedom is <unk> choice .
More choices people have , more <unk> , and more than the freedom , is their <unk> , more than their <unk> .
This is , <unk> , <unk> , so <unk> in society that nobody <unk> to <unk> in <unk> .
And it 's also <unk> <unk> in our lives .
I 'm going to show you some examples of what progress has made .
This is my <unk> . It 's not particularly big .
I 'm going to have a simple note on <unk> to <unk> .
In my <unk> , there are <unk> <unk> , without <unk> the 10 <unk> of <unk> <unk> and 12 <unk> <unk> you can buy for a huge number of <unk> <unk> in <unk> that nobody already <unk> in <unk> that no one of the <unk> already is your <unk> .
Here 's what <unk> is .
Then you go to the <unk> store for buy a <unk> : <unk> , <unk> , radio , <unk> , <unk> .
And in this single <unk> store , there 's a lot of <unk> .
We can make six and a half million different <unk> using the <unk> that there are in one <unk> .
<unk> <unk> that there is <unk> choice .
<unk> : The world of <unk> .
Once , when I was a child , you could get all the <unk> services , to <unk> that they were <unk> by <unk> <unk> .
You <unk> the phone , you don 't <unk> it .
A <unk> of that , by the way , was that the phone never <unk> .
These days are gone .
We have a <unk> <unk> of <unk> , especially between cell phones .
Here 's cell phones .
My <unk> is in the middle , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , and <unk> for <unk> <unk> .
If you haven 't seen it in the <unk> <unk> , you 're <unk> that soon soon as as they would be <unk> .
And what 's the end of the end of the <unk> and ask this question . And you know , what the answer is , " No . "
It 's not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn 't face <unk> .
So , in other <unk> of life that are much more important than <unk> , <unk> the same <unk> of choices .
<unk> <unk> : You don 't happen in the United States you 're going to <unk> and <unk> you what you have to do .
Instead , <unk> from the <unk> , and the <unk> says , " OK , we could do it , or <unk> " <unk> " <unk> " <unk> " <unk> " <unk> these <unk> and <unk> " <unk> has these <unk> and <unk> . What do you want to do ? "
You <unk> him : " <unk> , what would you like to do ? "
And the <unk> says , " He 's got these <unk> and these <unk> , and <unk> has these <unk> and <unk> . "
" What do you want to do ? "
And you say , " <unk> if she was me , what would you like ? "
And the <unk> : " But I 'm not her . "
The result we call it <unk> <unk> , which makes it look like a beautiful thing .
But actually , it 's not that one <unk> the weight and responsibility to make decisions from someone who knows something , <unk> the <unk> , <unk> , to somebody who knows something that 's about it , and it 's certainly not in <unk> -- and therefore it 's certainly <unk> -- and so that you don 't know -- and it 's <unk> .
There 's a huge <unk> of <unk> products , <unk> to people like me and you , if you think about it has no sense , because we can 't <unk> .
But if we can 't <unk> , why we <unk> them ?
The answer is they want to <unk> , we call the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> that 's so <unk> , as we have our <unk> now is a question of how you see in this <unk> . " We don 't want to <unk> kids . <unk> their sex at the right time . " " <unk> a <unk> . " We need to <unk> . " We don 't <unk> a <unk> . " We need to <unk> . "
And we can <unk> how many times we <unk> .
which means every <unk> , to <unk> , you have to decide that kind of person , you have to decide that kind of person .
<unk> to family and <unk> , a <unk> time , <unk> almost for anyone , was that <unk> to us as soon as possible , and you could <unk> , and you could <unk> the <unk> as soon as possible .
The only real choice was with who , not when , and not when you know ,
<unk> , it 's really to play .
They were very smart students , and they <unk> 20 percent in less than a time .
And not because they 're <unk> , not because they 're <unk> .
but why are I 'm <unk> , I 'm going to <unk> , " <unk> or not ? "
" <unk> <unk> <unk> later ? I 've got to think about <unk> or children or career ? "
They 're <unk> <unk> .
And they try to answer these questions , even if this <unk> , I don 't <unk> the <unk> that I don 't have the <unk> that I would <unk> .
And they have to do it . They 're important questions .
Now , the work : we 're <unk> , as <unk> <unk> , because technology <unk> us to work every day , every day , from every corner of the planet , <unk> <unk> .
<unk> , there 's a <unk> , and I 'm not going to say to anybody , where the <unk> works .
I don 't tell you , because I want to use it .
What does this mean , this incredible freedom of choice we have about work ? It 's that we need to <unk> , <unk> at any time , if we have to work or not .
We can go to see our son to play <unk> , with the cell phone in a <unk> , the other , and the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
And even if they 're all <unk> , every minute we see the <unk> , we 're also <unk> , " I have to <unk> this call ? "
" I have to <unk> this <unk> ? I have to <unk> this letter ? "
And even when the answer is " no , " that makes it a <unk> experience of your son a lot of different conditions than what would be would be in other conditions .
So , from any of you look , little things and big objects , and <unk> and <unk> , life is a question of choices .
Once the world was this : <unk> , there were some chance , but not everything was a question of choice .
The world today is <unk> to this : " Is it a <unk> , " Is it a <unk> , or <unk> ? "
The answer is <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> we all know , so I 'm going to talk about the <unk> .
I would have two effects effects of people .
The first , <unk> , is that it <unk> instead of <unk> .
With many <unk> of which <unk> , it becomes very difficult to do .
I 'm going to give you one example : a study <unk> <unk> <unk> .
A <unk> of my <unk> had access to <unk> , <unk> society , with about a million <unk> <unk> in different companies .
What she discovered is that for every 10 <unk> that are <unk> , the <unk> of <unk> <unk> two percent .
With 50 <unk> <unk> , there 's 10 percent less than <unk> when they 're only five . Why ?
Because with 50 <unk> between which <unk> , is <unk> difficult to decide , and the choice is <unk> .
And in <unk> , and still <unk> , <unk> , and of course <unk> , and of course <unk> never comes to .
<unk> that doesn 't mean that just means that these <unk> <unk> <unk> food to <unk> because they don 't have enough money , wants to say that the decision is so <unk> that they can also <unk> <unk> <unk> of work .
They 're not <unk> , they 're <unk> up to five <unk> year from the <unk> of work , which would be <unk> .
So <unk> is a <unk> of <unk> to have <unk> choices .
And I think I would <unk> the world .
" And finally , to end up , <unk> or <unk> ? "
I 'm going to be <unk> , if it 's for <unk> , right ?
You don 't want to choose the wrong <unk> , and <unk> the wrong <unk> .
So this is the first effect . The second one is that even if we can <unk> <unk> and <unk> to make a choice , at the end , we 're <unk> from the result of how to <unk> states with .
And that 's for several reasons .
One of them is that with many <unk> between which <unk> , if you take one and it 's not perfect , it 's easy to imagine that they could make a different choice that would be better . And what 's going on is that the <unk> <unk> us to <unk> the choice , and the <unk> <unk> <unk> by <unk> ,
even when it was a <unk> decision .
<unk> choice , there are , more <unk> than any <unk> <unk> of any <unk> <unk> .
<unk> , there 's what <unk> call .
<unk> has <unk> very well as <unk> as the value that we give things to what we call them .
<unk> rest , when there are many <unk> possible , it 's easy to <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> of <unk> and <unk> <unk> than <unk> .
Here 's one example . I 'm <unk> with everybody who are not New York .
But that 's probably <unk> .
There 's this <unk> <unk> .
A place of <unk> .
<unk> . <unk> day . It 's all about the day .
It 's not going to be there . But what he thinks is , " Well , <unk> , it 's <unk> . "
" All of my <unk> are <unk> . "
" <unk> <unk> <unk> right in front of the house . "
And it <unk> two weeks from the idea that 's going to <unk> -- every day -- the chance of <unk> where it wants .
The <unk> <unk> <unk> for what we have , even when choice was <unk> .
And the <unk> we have from <unk> , the more <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> us against how to <unk> .
Here 's another example .
This <unk> tells us a lot of things .
It 's about living the moment , and maybe of living in slowly .
But the most important thing is that anything you want , you to <unk> , you will not do other .
The things that don 't have many <unk> that can make less <unk> what we do .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> <unk> .
I tried it on my skin <unk> a new couple of <unk> .
I 'd always like to be <unk> .
Once the <unk> were a <unk> , <unk> them and <unk> by <unk> , were <unk> , only after <unk> a life <unk> and <unk> a lot of times , <unk> to go well .
So , I went to <unk> a couple of new when the <unk> were gone , and I said , " I need a couple of <unk> , this is my <unk> . "
The <unk> said to me , " Do you want to <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> ? "
<unk> you want them to <unk> or <unk> ? " <unk> " or " <unk> " or " <unk> " ? "
" <unk> wants them <unk> ? "
" <unk> <unk> <unk> or <unk> ? <unk> <unk> <unk> -- " <unk> <unk> .
I was <unk> , and after a little bit I was able to say , " I want the guy , " I don 't know what it was , so for an hour , I 'm <unk> all <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and then I went from the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and then I went from the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , with the best <unk> I ever had .
I was the <unk> . With all that choice I had <unk> the best .
But I 'm going to get worse .
Why ? I wrote a whole book to <unk> .
The reason I was worse is that with all that choice my <unk> were <unk> , the <unk> <unk> to be <unk> .
I had <unk> <unk> . I didn 't tell you anything I was going to <unk> when I just had a <unk> , but when I was 100 , I was <unk> , at least one kind had to be perfect .
What I had <unk> was good , but not perfect .
After I <unk> that I was <unk> in <unk> to <unk> .
The <unk> of <unk> in people 's life not <unk> the <unk> that these have <unk> <unk> that they have <unk> <unk> .
And this <unk> <unk> , even when the results are good .
<unk> in the world of <unk> if they realized .
Because if I <unk> it , I don 't tell you what I 'm talking about .
The truth <unk> to this .
" It was better when it was worse , " The reason he was better when he was worse , it was , when he was worse , it was , you could <unk> <unk> .
<unk> , in the world that we live in -- <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , which we can <unk> is that things are <unk> .
You never have to <unk> <unk> because your <unk> , my <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
The <unk> of happiness -- what you 're here -- is , " <unk> <unk> " Yes , you want to . "
I mean , little <unk> moment -- who 's a <unk> moment , and my wife is really <unk> .
I couldn 't do better , I didn 't have <unk> .
But <unk> isn 't always a <unk> thing .
<unk> , a <unk> of <unk> <unk> when there 's only that kind of <unk> is that when you 're not <unk> , and when you 're not <unk> , and you say , " Why ? "
" Who is <unk> ? " <unk> is <unk> . "
The world is <unk> . What would I do you do it ?
When there are hundreds of types of <unk> , and you <unk> one <unk> , and you 'll tell who is the <unk> , it 's <unk> clear that you 're .
They could have better .
With hundreds of <unk> available , there are no <unk> for <unk> .
So when people make decisions , even if the <unk> is <unk> , they <unk> and <unk> their own .
In the last few years , the <unk> is <unk> in the <unk> world .
I think a <unk> <unk> -- not the only , but important -- of this <unk> of <unk> is just that people have experiences because the standard are too <unk> .
And when they have to <unk> this situation , they think <unk> is them .
So the final result is that in general , we 're better , <unk> , but we 'll get worse .
Let me tell you .
This is <unk> <unk> , what we all take for good and is completely <unk> . It 's not true .
There 's no <unk> that a little bit of choice is better than <unk> at all , but this doesn 't have a lot of choice is a bit .
There 's a <unk> , <unk> . I don 't know what it is .
But I 'm quite sure we 've <unk> from a piece of the level that our lives .
Now , from the <unk> <unk> -- I 've been <unk> -- from the point of view , <unk> is the <unk> .
What allows all this choice in <unk> society is the <unk> material .
There are many places in the world , and you know , you know , where the problem is not that they have <unk> choice .
The problem is they have too <unk> .
So the <unk> I 'm talking about is a <unk> of <unk> , <unk> society .
And what <unk> does <unk> and <unk> is this : <unk> <unk> <unk> to you yesterday about how the <unk> and <unk> to <unk> <unk> to <unk> are <unk> . It 's a <unk> of money .
I mean that these choices , <unk> and <unk> , is not that they 're just <unk> .
They 're <unk> <unk> .
They make us worse .
If a bit of what we do in our society allows choice was to be <unk> in those where people have too few people , not just be <unk> their life .
This is what <unk> call a <unk> <unk> .
A <unk> of income does well for everybody -- not just the poor -- because of this choice in <unk> that we have .
So to <unk> : " <unk> , you can get all you want to be ...
<unk> , people of culture , " But what do you do ? "
" It 's <unk> that you can 't do anything in a glass <unk> . "
" A <unk> imagination , a <unk> view of the world --
and I <unk> it like this , at the beginning .
But then , <unk> , instead , I realized that that fish knows it 's a long .
Because the reality of the <unk> is that if you <unk> the <unk> , so that you can 't <unk> the freedom . You <unk> the <unk> .
If you <unk> the <unk> so that you could <unk> the <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> .
They all need a <unk> .
This is almost certainly too <unk> , maybe even for the fish , and certainly for us .
But the <unk> of some <unk> is a <unk> for <unk> and , for <unk> .
Thank you so much .
