<unk> year I showed these <unk> to <unk> that the <unk> <unk> <unk> , which for almost three million years old had the size of the United States <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
I 'm going to <unk> this <unk> of the problem because it 's not show the ice .
<unk> <unk> is , in a sense , the heart <unk> of global warming .
It 's <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
The next <unk> will be a <unk> <unk> on the <unk> of the last 25 years .
<unk> <unk> are <unk> in red .
You see , you 're <unk> up to the blue <unk> .
That 's the ice in <unk> , which <unk> in summer .
You can see that the <unk> <unk> ice , five years or more , is like blood , which here <unk> from the body .
In 25 years , it 's been <unk> .
This is a problem because the <unk> <unk> <unk> around the ocean <unk> where there are huge <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> , are <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> to the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> , that <unk> <unk> , the amount of <unk> .
In some <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> is already <unk> by the water .
The <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> ! <unk> : She 's good . The question is if we 're <unk> it .
One reason is that this <unk> <unk> <unk> from the north .
This is a <unk> river <unk> <unk> .
<unk> had never <unk> <unk> .
This is the <unk> river <unk> , in the <unk> of <unk> .
If you want to know how the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> on <unk> , here 's where the sea .
These <unk> are <unk> .
On the other part of the planet : <unk> , the largest <unk> of ice on the planet .
<unk> month , the scientists have <unk> that the <unk> of the ice is in <unk> , and that <unk> <unk> on some <unk> <unk> , is particularly <unk> in <unk> .
<unk> at six feet level of the <unk> , like <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> new <unk> , which a few years ago were <unk> .
<unk> percent of the world 's population <unk> <unk> from that <unk> .
<unk> <unk> : this <unk> is the source of the <unk> water of this city .
<unk> is <unk> .
But when you <unk> , the same happens to the <unk> water .
<unk> California <unk> <unk> <unk> is <unk> <unk> of 40 percent .
<unk> are in the crisis .
<unk> , as you read , they 're <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> are <unk> to a <unk> outside normal and without <unk> .
<unk> times more <unk> over the last 30 years than the <unk> <unk> .
This is a <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
If you look at the context context of them can see the <unk> .
In the last five years we 've <unk> 70 million <unk> of CO2 every day .
Look at the <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and on both <unk> <unk> , where there 's a <unk> <unk> of oxygen in the ocean .
The biggest <unk> because the global <unk> , together to <unk> , which is 20 percent , is the use of <unk> <unk> .
<unk> is a problem , and <unk> is even worse .
The United States is one of the two countries with <unk> emissions , together .
And they <unk> to build a lot of other <unk> .
But we 're <unk> to a <unk> of direction .
These are the <unk> projects over the last few years and some <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
<unk> , there 's a <unk> politics in our country .
<unk> <unk> and oil <unk> have <unk> <unk> million dollars in the last year to <unk> <unk> , which is a <unk> .
I 'm going to <unk> something --
<unk> <unk> , where I live , there was a <unk> of <unk> billion <unk> of <unk> .
You know , you 've seen it on <unk> .
This is the second largest flow of <unk> in America .
It 's happened around <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> was this .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> <unk> is a <unk> guy , and happy .
It 's <unk> here in America , and it <unk> our economy .
<unk> <unk> is more <unk> .
It 's <unk> , <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The largest <unk> society on the <unk> is <unk> <unk> . This is its <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> <unk> -- <unk> <unk> -- <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> -- not know what they 're talking about .
<unk> : So the <unk> for the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
This is one of them , one part .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> we see the <unk> changes as a <unk> <unk> to our business .
So , our <unk> is <unk> a big amount of money in a <unk> <unk> to make public and <unk> the truth on <unk> .
In fact , <unk> is not <unk> .
We think it 's <unk> -- it 's also a good <unk> .
So we don 't know about climate change .
We need to do .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> -- you know -- you 've heard about it very much .
So I <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> for how it 's about <unk> <unk> .
<unk> ! <unk> are a little <unk> , but this is the sound of <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> is between the main <unk> of global <unk> , but the <unk> technology of <unk> <unk> that you see .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> technology . This is the <unk> technology .
<unk> : <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to the economic issue and the national security .
<unk> : <unk> America is in the crisis ; the <unk> , <unk> , the <unk> crisis .
The <unk> that <unk> all : our <unk> <unk> from the <unk> <unk> , like <unk> <unk> and oil .
Now , there 's a new , <unk> solution to <unk> .
<unk> America : 100 percent of <unk> energy , in <unk> .
A plan to <unk> America at work , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , and help <unk> the global <unk> .
<unk> , a solution that we 're going to solve our problems .
<unk> America . <unk> more .
<unk> : That 's the last one .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> . It 's about <unk> energy .
One of the most <unk> ways to <unk> <unk> from the <unk> that we <unk> our planet .
<unk> : The future is here . <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> two : <unk> <unk> for work .
<unk> : <unk> America . It 's time to be <unk> .
<unk> : A old <unk> <unk> says , " If you want to go <unk> , go from alone .
If you want to go away , go together . "
We have to go far far , fast .
Thank you very much .
<unk> year at TED , I made a <unk> on <unk> .
And I try to <unk> on how the machine works .
So here we go . And for those that the other time were no , the <unk> is the largest scientific experiment that you 've ever been -- <unk> miles .
His task is to <unk> the conditions that were <unk> in the beginning of the universe -- to <unk> million times a second .
That 's just <unk> .
This is the car under <unk> .
We <unk> these <unk> <unk> within the <unk> .
This is what I work . It 's called <unk> -- it 's <unk> <unk> feet and it has a <unk> <unk> .
This is an <unk> image of <unk> <unk> in this way you can see the <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> last year we <unk> the machine .
And this picture was <unk> by <unk> .
It was because of <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> .
It 's an image of the first <unk> of particles that had done all the <unk> <unk> , <unk> , with a part of the <unk> , and <unk> particles inside the <unk> .
In other words , when you <unk> that image the <unk> 10 <unk> , you know that the <unk> machine , which is a big <unk> .
I don 't know if it was this to <unk> <unk> or this , when someone <unk> on Google and <unk> the page was this .
That means we have had a <unk> impact over to that scientific .
<unk> a week later , there was a problem with the machine , had to do this <unk> here -- these <unk> <unk> .
These <unk> <unk> <unk> when the car works at the <unk> <unk> .
Now , the <unk> between you <unk> <unk> and <unk> , " It 's not true . It 's too <unk> . "
And instead they can do it because when they 're very <unk> <unk> <unk> .
So , at least <unk> degrees <unk> at a <unk> temperature <unk> to the space of the stars , these <unk> can bring that <unk> .
In one of the <unk> between the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , there was a <unk> <unk> .
So the <unk> <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
This was the result .
Now , this is even more <unk> if you think that these <unk> <unk> more than 20 <unk> , and you have <unk> about 30 <unk> .
They 're <unk> about 50 <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , what we did .
We <unk> them and <unk> .
They 're all <unk> to their <unk> place .
<unk> the end of <unk> <unk> is going to be again .
<unk> it , and we <unk> to get some data to <unk> or <unk> , and continue to <unk> how our <unk> are the <unk> that <unk> the universe .
Now , of course , in some way , these <unk> <unk> <unk> on the value of science and engineering <unk> . It 's easy to <unk> .
I think the fact that it 's so hard , the fact that I think is the value of things like <unk> .
I want to end with the words of a <unk> <unk> , which , <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> experiments of the <unk> experiments of the <unk> experiments of the <unk> of the <unk> , he said , " No is so <unk> for progress of the human mind as the ideas of science are <unk> , which we don 't have to <unk> . "
Thank you .
I want to start <unk> to <unk> when you , children , <unk> with <unk> .
<unk> like <unk> and <unk> , <unk> and <unk> and <unk> , <unk> , actually , thinking about thinking and <unk> problems .
<unk> is <unk> <unk> to the way we <unk> the world around us .
So , from <unk> <unk> from the <unk> of our <unk> with <unk> objects , together to my <unk> <unk> , and my <unk> <unk> <unk> , I started <unk> : " And if we use a computer , instead of having the only <unk> of the <unk> <unk> as digital <unk> <unk> as a <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , with <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and I started <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
and <unk> to our <unk> ?
The question was so interesting that we were trying to explore the answer , building <unk> .
In a few words , a <unk> is a <unk> computer as a <unk> .
In a few words , a <unk> is a <unk> computer as a <unk> .
You can <unk> them with your hand , they can " <unk> " <unk> " between them , " feel the <unk> movement and they have a <unk> radio <unk> .
But <unk> , they 're <unk> objects , like <unk> , you can just <unk> .
<unk> are the example of a new <unk> of tools to <unk> information .
And as they become more <unk> , <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> , <unk> of the other , and as they become more <unk> , <unk> of the <unk> , <unk> of the other , how we can <unk> them , and <unk> <unk> .
<unk> with some simple example .
This <unk> is <unk> to show <unk> : if you <unk> it in a direction , the video <unk> so , if we <unk> on the other hand , you know , if you <unk> on the other hand .
These <unk> are <unk> of others .
If you <unk> them , you 're <unk> to what they 're going to .
If they come up , you know , and they can <unk> it a little bit .
If they come up , you know , and they can <unk> it a little bit .
They also <unk> their movement and <unk> .
We then realized that one of the interesting <unk> of the <unk> <unk> was the <unk> that we could use common on data , to example , " <unk> " a color as if it was a <unk> .
In this case , we have three <unk> <unk> as a <unk> of <unk> and I can <unk> to <unk> the color in the central one , where you 're <unk> .
and I can <unk> to <unk> the color of the central one , where you 're <unk> .
You know , you can <unk> it a little bit about it .
I 'm also <unk> <unk> <unk> , like <unk> , math and <unk> <unk> where people can try the <unk> things , and <unk> the <unk> <unk> .
I 'm ...
This is a sequence of <unk> I do with a <unk> program .
Here we have a <unk> of words that are half the <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> , every <unk> <unk> <unk> a letter to <unk> on every <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , every <unk> <unk> a letter to <unk> on every <unk> , and while I <unk> <unk> words , he <unk> on a <unk> .
Then , after about 30 seconds , you <unk> , and you have a new <unk> of <unk> and new <unk> to try .
Thank you .
Here 's the kids <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> , I did this in the <unk> <unk> , I made them a video .
They 're very <unk> .
And one of the interesting things about this kind of <unk> is that you don 't have to give people a lot .
I just say , " <unk> of the words , " and they know exactly what to do .
Here 's other people who <unk> it .
This is our <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and I 'm going to the right .
It was just <unk> .
They were just <unk> , for him .
Now , this is a <unk> <unk> .
We wanted to build a tool for the <unk> of <unk> . He 's <unk> .
It can <unk> new characters in the scene , <unk> their <unk> .
It can <unk> new characters in the scene , <unk> their <unk> .
Here 's , it 's doing the sun .
<unk> : The sun is <unk> .
<unk> : Now , he 's brought a <unk> in the scene .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> .
<unk> work ! Yes ! Yes !
So , <unk> <unk> and <unk> can <unk> the characters --
<unk> : <unk> !
... <unk> their story .
<unk> : <unk> !
<unk> : It 's a story with the final story with open , and it can decide it as you <unk> .
<unk> : It 's a story with the final story with open , and it can decide it as you <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> away , <unk> .
<unk> : The last example I have the time to show you is a <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> and <unk> music .
is a recently , <unk> <unk> , <unk> and <unk> music .
<unk> here are <unk> by <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> of these have four different <unk> , and you can choose what you use .
You can also <unk> these <unk> in a sequence from <unk> to <unk> .
And I just <unk> by doing a <unk> sound and a sequence .
These are effects that you can control from alive , like <unk> and <unk> .
I <unk> it to a particular sound , and then <unk> to <unk> .
And then there are the effects of <unk> and <unk> , which <unk> the whole sequence .
<unk> how it works .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> in a series of <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> on the other basic <unk> .
Now , I 'm going to take a <unk> line .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> <unk> --
<unk> : And now I 'm going to <unk> the <unk> , so I can control the effect of alive .
<unk> : <unk> : I can I <unk> the whole sequence <unk> time from one side or the other .
<unk> : And now we 're going to <unk> the bottom to give more <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> : I can I <unk> the sequence of the flight .
So I don 't have to <unk> before , but I can <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
And now , finally , I can <unk> the whole sequence <unk> left the <unk> <unk> .
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is building new <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to how our brain work and body .
And today , I 've had time to show you one of the results of this path , and some possibilities that we try to bring out of the lab .
The concept I want to talk about is that it 's going to <unk> this new generation of <unk> objects to <unk> with the <unk> media , which we want to do .
Thank you very much .
I don 't see the time of talking to you .
I 'm a <unk> .
<unk> books is my <unk> , but it 's more than that , of course .
It 's also love and the <unk> of my life .
And I don 't look like that it can change .
But , I said that , something particular happened in my life and my career , which <unk> me to <unk> the whole <unk> of this work .
The particular thing is I wrote this book , this <unk> called " <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , " which , <unk> from my <unk> books , for some reason reason to the world and <unk> a big , <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
And the result is everywhere , people <unk> me as if I was <unk> .
<unk> -- <unk> , <unk> !
I 'm going to <unk> , I 'm not afraid to me to say , " You don 't fear of you not be able to do better ?
You don 't fear to keep writing for the whole life without having more <unk> to create a book that can <unk> to do ? "
<unk> that can <unk> to someone ? "
It 's <unk> , you know .
But it could go worse , and I remember that over 20 years ago , when I was <unk> to say to people -- I was a <unk> .
I 'm going to talk to the same <unk> <unk> .
And people told me , " Don 't you know that I don 't have to be successful ?
You don 't fear you don 't know that the <unk> <unk> <unk> ?
You don 't fear to do this <unk> for all life without anything that you have ever been out and die on a <unk> of <unk> <unk> with the <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> ?
<unk> so , you know .
The answer -- the short answer to all these questions is , " Yes . "
Yes , I 'm afraid of all those things .
I 've always had fear .
And I 'm afraid of many other things that people couldn 't <unk> .
<unk> and other things <unk> .
But , as much about the one I thought and I was <unk> to me is why ?
<unk> ?
It 's <unk> that anybody who <unk> <unk> to be <unk> by a job that you feel born to do .
But what 's so particular in the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to <unk> health <unk> in a way that other <unk> do they do not ?
As my father , for example , he was a <unk> <unk> and I didn 't remember one time in the 40 years of activity where the <unk> was asked if she was <unk> to be <unk> ?
It was never -- that <unk> of <unk> John , how do you go ?
<unk> 't we <unk> it , <unk> ?
<unk> , the engineers <unk> like group , they don 't , in <unk> , <unk> the <unk> to be <unk> <unk> .
We <unk> , we have enough this <unk> , and not only <unk> but <unk> , but we don 't have this <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And I don 't want to look at the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> that , only in the <unk> century , <unk> young and often for them .
And the ones that don 't have <unk> to be really <unk> by their <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , before he died , in the last <unk> said , " Every book my book <unk> me a little more , " A little more <unk> about the work of their life .
But we don 't know when we were <unk> to say , because we 've heard these things so much we have <unk> and <unk> the <unk> that creativity and <unk> are in some way <unk> and <unk> and <unk> the <unk> are in some way <unk> and <unk> and <unk> to be in some way <unk> and <unk> .
And the question I want to <unk> to all over here is : you 're <unk> with this idea ?
It 's good for you . It 's going to be <unk> from a <unk> <unk> to me not go .
I think it 's <unk> .
And I think it 's <unk> , and I don 't want to <unk> in the next century .
I think it 's better <unk> our big <unk> to live .
And I certainly know , in my case -- it 's going to be very <unk> to start <unk> to that <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in which I 'm in my career .
<unk> -- look at it , I 'm pretty young , I was about 40 years .
I still have about four <unk> of work in me .
And it 's very <unk> that anything <unk> now in the world as the work that we <unk> it from the world as the work that we <unk> the last book of my last book .
<unk> <unk> , because we 're all about , because we 're all <unk> my greatest <unk> is to my <unk> .
Oh , <unk> , <unk> , who thought !
You know , that 's the kind of thought that brings a person to start <unk> to the nine of the morning and I don 't want to do it .
I continue to do this work that I love .
So , the question becomes , how ?
And so it looks like , after many <unk> , which the way of working to keep <unk> is to create a <unk> <unk> <unk> , OK ?
I have to get a <unk> distance between me , which I 'm <unk> , and my natural <unk> on what the <unk> <unk> <unk> . And , as I was <unk> for the last year , and to find other society to see if you can look through time , trying to find other society to see if you could have more <unk> and see if you can have more <unk> and see if you can get more <unk> and find out .
about how to help people <unk> <unk> <unk> of creativity .
And that research took me to the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
<unk> because I 'm going to go back and then <unk> back .
<unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> -- people don 't believe that creativity <unk> from men , OK ?
It was <unk> that creativity was this <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> to men from some <unk> <unk> and <unk> , for <unk> and <unk> , for <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> of the <unk> of creativity <unk> .
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> to have a <unk> that <unk> <unk> from far away .
<unk> were the same idea , but <unk> that <unk> the <unk> of the spirit without a <unk> .
which is <unk> , because the <unk> <unk> didn 't really know that a <unk> was someone particularly smart .
I thought a <unk> was this sort of <unk> <unk> <unk> , literally in the <unk> of a artist , a little bit like <unk> <unk> , and <unk> out of the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> the work of the artist 's artist and <unk> the result of that work .
<unk> <unk> here , that 's the distance I 'm talking -- that <unk> you from the results of your work .
And everybody <unk> that was so <unk> , right ?
So the artists were <unk> by <unk> things , like the too <unk> , like the too <unk> , right ?
If your work was <unk> , you didn 't get the <unk> , you know , you know , you know , you know , you 'd say that it was <unk> by this <unk> <unk> .
If your work <unk> , it wasn 't all your <unk> , right ?
<unk> <unk> was your <unk> to be a <unk> .
And so people <unk> creativity <unk> to <unk> the creativity of <unk> for a long time .
Then the <unk> <unk> and <unk> , and <unk> this big idea ; we put the human human <unk> around the universe above all the <unk> and the <unk> and <unk> without more space to the <unk> .
This was the <unk> of <unk> <unk> and people were <unk> to think that creativity <unk> <unk> completely from the <unk> .
And for the first time in history , <unk> to <unk> to this or that artist as a <unk> <unk> that to a person with <unk> <unk> .
And I have to <unk> , I think it was a big <unk> .
I think you 're going to <unk> someone , a simple person to believe that I think that I would think of it as a <unk> , <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> is a <unk> <unk> too big to <unk> human <unk> .
It 's like <unk> to someone to <unk> the sun .
<unk> and <unk> completely <unk> the <unk> and creates all these <unk> <unk> .
And I think it was this pressure to have <unk> artists in <unk> 500 years .
And , if that 's true , and I think that 's the question is , it becomes , and now ?
Can we do it <unk> ?
I 'm going to go back to a <unk> understanding of human relationship between humans and <unk> .
Or maybe no .
Maybe we can 't <unk> 500 years of thinking in a <unk> <unk> .
And there 's probably people in the audience who <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> on the <unk> , <unk> , you <unk> people <unk> to <unk> their <unk> .
You probably don 't <unk> all about this thing .
But the question I 'd like to <unk> is -- why don 't it ?
Why don 't we <unk> this way ?
Because it has more sense of every other thing that I 've ever heard about to explain the <unk> of the <unk> process .
A process that , as anyone who have ever <unk> to do something -- so , basically , all of here -- knows , you don 't <unk> <unk> .
And in fact , it can sometimes completely <unk> .
I did this <unk> <unk> with the amazing <unk> <unk> , which has now 90 years , but that was a <unk> for all the life and said that during his <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> out in the <unk> <unk> , <unk> out in the fields , and <unk> it , within the <unk> , and <unk> it , within if you <unk> the <unk> .
He said , he was like a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And that <unk> <unk> to her from the <unk> .
I <unk> it to it , because he <unk> the land under its feet .
I decided to have one thing to do is , and he was , and he was , " <unk> like a <unk> . "
And then he was <unk> by this <unk> , and it wouldn 't have to do anything else that take a piece of paper and a <unk> enough <unk> to the <unk> , and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> on the page .
<unk> times I didn 't start to be enough fast , so <unk> and <unk> and <unk> without getting to home and the <unk> <unk> and she would <unk> the <unk> and she would <unk> through the <unk> , looking for , as she said , " another <unk> . "
Then there were those times -- this piece never <unk> it -- there were no <unk> . There were almost <unk> , OK ?
So , he was <unk> home and was trying to <unk> and the <unk> <unk> through , and he <unk> the <unk> through , and then said , that was like , and then said , that was like if you <unk> with the other hand and <unk> .
<unk> the <unk> from the tail and the <unk> in his body and the <unk> on the page .
And in these cases , the <unk> would be <unk> on the page and <unk> , but the <unk> , the <unk> to the <unk> .
So when you <unk> it -- it 's <unk> , it 's exactly <unk> to my <unk> process .
Not all my <unk> process -- I 'm not a <unk> !
I 'm a <unk> , and my way of <unk> is ; I 'm going to <unk> every day and work and work and <unk> and work and work and <unk> over the <unk> .
But even me , in my <unk> , I <unk> against that , sometimes .
And I 'm sure many of you <unk> it .
You know , even if the work and the ideas <unk> me <unk> from a source I couldn 't <unk> .
And what is this thing ?
And how can we <unk> to it in a way that we don 't lose your head , but rather , what <unk> <unk> us ?
So , as I 'm going to <unk> <unk> that I have is the <unk> <unk> , which I 've <unk> <unk> , which I 've been <unk> years ago for a <unk> .
I 'm talking about this , and you know , <unk> , for the <unk> of life was the <unk> artist <unk> , trying to control , <unk> these <unk> species of <unk> <unk> <unk> .
But then <unk> , he was <unk> , and a day while he was <unk> on a <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> all over him .
<unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> this little <unk> of <unk> , which comes into his head as the <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> , you know , it 's wonderful , and the <unk> , you know , it 's wonderful , and the <unk> , but it doesn 't know how to <unk> .
It doesn 't have a piece of paper , it doesn 't have a <unk> .
So he starts to hear this sort of old <unk> <unk> grow in him , like , " I 'm going to lose it , and <unk> <unk> from this <unk> song .
I 'm not <unk> enough , and I can 't <unk> . "
And instead of going to <unk> , they <unk> .
<unk> the whole <unk> process and made something completely new .
I just the sky and said , " <unk> , you don 't see it 's <unk> ? "
" It looks like a song now ?
If you really want to <unk> , you 're going to get a <unk> moment when I can <unk> care about you .
<unk> , <unk> to <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . "
And its <unk> process after that .
Not the work , the work was still <unk> as always .
But the process , and the <unk> <unk> was <unk> when he <unk> the <unk> was <unk> when he <unk> the <unk> , the <unk> that outside , and <unk> <unk> it was going to go back from where it was , he <unk> that it was not to be a <unk> and <unk> .
but I <unk> this <unk> , wonderful <unk> <unk> a conversation between <unk> and this <unk> thing , but it was not <unk> .
So , how much much <unk> that story to change a little bit , even the way I 'm going to do and already , I 'm going to <unk> a time .
This idea , I was <unk> when I was <unk> , " <unk> , " and I <unk> , " and I <unk> in one of the <unk> of the <unk> that we 're all working on something and you can 't start thinking that 's going to be a <unk> , which is going to be the <unk> .
Not just <unk> , just <unk> book .
And I started thinking about <unk> this project .
But then I 'm <unk> to <unk> that <unk> to the air and <unk> .
So I <unk> my face on the <unk> and <unk> my <unk> to a <unk> corner of the room .
And I said to high <unk> , " <unk> , " <unk> , " What if this book is not going to be <unk> my , no ?
Because as you see I 'm <unk> everything I have , I have no more than that I have , I don 't have more about this .
So if you want it to be better , you have to <unk> and do your part .
OK . But if you don 't do it , you know what , I don 't know .
I started writing the same because it 's my work .
And I would like me that was <unk> that I 'm <unk> to do my part . " Because -- at the end is so , OK -- it 's <unk> . <unk> does it do in the <unk> of the moon , <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
And they were always <unk> , because the <unk> were <unk> and <unk> .
But every <unk> , <unk> , something <unk> , and one of these <unk> artists actually <unk> .
And I know you know about what I 'm talking about , because I know you 've all seen , at a certain point , a <unk> like this .
It was like the time <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> through a kind of <unk> and it was doing nothing different from the <unk> , like the <unk> <unk> <unk> before , but it <unk> .
And suddenly it doesn 't just like a human .
But they <unk> from the <unk> and <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk> .
And when this <unk> , at the time , people were <unk> what was , he <unk> it with her name .
<unk> hands and <unk> to <unk> , " <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , God , " God , " God , "
That 's God , you know .
I 'm going to <unk> -- when the <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> this <unk> with them and <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , " which you can still feel in the <unk> or <unk> .
In <unk> , when a artist has done something impossible and <unk> , " <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> -- a <unk> of God .
And it 's <unk> because we need .
But , the problem comes the next day , for the <unk> itself , when you <unk> and <unk> that are 11 of the <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> God is no longer .
It 's just a <unk> <unk> with much <unk> , and maybe you never get more to that <unk> .
And maybe no one <unk> the name of God as <unk> , and what 's got to do with the rest of his life ?
It 's hard .
This is one of the most <unk> <unk> to do in a <unk> life .
But maybe it doesn 't have to be so <unk> if you don 't believe , <unk> , <unk> the <unk> <unk> of your being being being being <unk> .
But I just <unk> you 're just <unk> data from a <unk> source of this <unk> part of this <unk> part of your life you have to get to <unk> when you 're finished .
And , you know , if we think that 's all the change .
And so I started <unk> , and it 's certainly like I <unk> for different months during the <unk> of the book that I was going to be , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> my <unk> ,
And what I have to continue <unk> when I feel <unk> from this is , I don 't fear .
Don 't <unk> . You just <unk> your work .
<unk> to <unk> your <unk> , any can be .
If your work is <unk> , <unk> .
If the <unk> , you 're going to <unk> you <unk> <unk> some kind of <unk> , for just a moment through your <unk> , then , " <unk> ! "
<unk> , you do the same <unk> .
And <unk> ! " <unk> ! "
I think I think and I think it 's <unk> .
" <unk> ! " <unk> ! " <unk> , " even for <unk> love and <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Thank you .
Thank you .
<unk> <unk> : <unk> !
As I 've been talking about some of these projects on the human genome , what it can <unk> and <unk> of <unk> new genes .
We 're <unk> a new way , we started <unk> biology and now start <unk> biology and now start from that digital code , and <unk> life .
We 've always been trying to <unk> big questions .
" <unk> is life ? " It 's something that many <unk> , I think they have <unk> to understand at different levels .
We have <unk> <unk> , <unk> to the <unk> terms of <unk> .
We 're <unk> over the age of 20 .
When we <unk> the human genome <unk> to go from the world of biology <unk> .
Now , we <unk> us : can we <unk> life , or create new life from this digital universe ?
This is the map of a small <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> , which is the species from the small genome between those that can <unk> in the lab .
And we tried to reduce <unk> the genome to <unk> a little bit more small .
We 're able to <unk> a <unk> of genes about 500 that are here .
But when we take a look at its <unk> map , it 's <unk> simple than our .
<unk> , that 's very simple .
But when we look at all the genes that we can <unk> , one at the time , is very <unk> that this can bring to a <unk> cell .
So I thought the only way to <unk> was <unk> this <unk> <unk> to <unk> some of these <unk> questions .
And so we started the <unk> of " <unk> <unk> . " Can we <unk> a <unk> ? "
Can the chemistry <unk> of produce these big molecules that we never have been able to create before .
And , in case , can we <unk> a <unk> ?
A <unk> is just a piece of <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The speed with which we 're able to <unk> life is <unk> to <unk> .
Our ability to write the <unk> code , instead of <unk> rather slowly , but it 's <unk> .
And our <unk> <unk> <unk> .
We <unk> over 15 years ago .
The process has <unk> many <unk> , <unk> with a <unk> <unk> before we <unk> the first experiments .
But we found that <unk> of DNA is very hard .
There are <unk> of thousands of cars in the world that <unk> small <unk> of DNA , <unk> <unk> <unk> , and it 's a <unk> process : the <unk> is the long <unk> , the <unk> is the long <unk> , the <unk> is the long , the <unk> is .
So we had to develop a new <unk> to <unk> these <unk> and <unk> the <unk> .
And this was our first <unk> , <unk> from the digital information of <unk> <unk> genome .
It 's a small virus that bacteria bacteria .
We designed <unk> , <unk> the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> a <unk> of DNA <unk> <unk> .
The interesting part is when we took this piece of <unk> <unk> <unk> and we <unk> it in the bacteria , the bacteria have <unk> to read this code <unk> code and <unk> the <unk> particles .
<unk> particles have been <unk> by the cells , they 're <unk> back and have <unk> <unk> .
I talked about recently recently with members of the <unk> <unk> <unk> that they have of course this model .
They have more <unk> than you .
<unk> that this is a situation where the software can actually build its own <unk> in a <unk> system .
But we need to do the biggest things .
We wanted to build the whole <unk> of <unk> .
They are more than <unk> <unk> code .
So we thought we were <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk> , so that we can change the <unk> to understand what the <unk> of a <unk> cell .
<unk> is <unk> , and if you <unk> with information information information <unk> in a computer , these have to be very <unk> .
When we <unk> this genome for the first time in <unk> , the standard <unk> was a <unk> for every 10 <unk> <unk> .
We found , <unk> , <unk> <unk> . If we were used that original <unk> , you know , you 'd never been able to do it work .
A process of the process is to design <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> with all the other <unk> <unk> to build smaller <unk> <unk> <unk> .
We 're going to be <unk> here .
You probably read that we 're going to <unk> <unk> .
<unk> : We have a <unk> code <unk> on four <unk> : <unk> , <unk> and <unk> and <unk>
<unk> of those <unk> <unk> together , <unk> about 20 <unk> , and there 's a <unk> order to <unk> every <unk> .
So we can use the code <unk> to write words , <unk> , <unk> .
What we did we have at the beginning was <unk> .
Some have been <unk> by the fact that it wasn 't <unk> .
We designed these <unk> to <unk> <unk> .
There are <unk> that <unk> them and <unk> them .
And we started <unk> <unk> <unk> . <unk> with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to them .
But every step , we made these <unk> in <unk> so that we 're <unk> <unk> , which we 're <unk> to create a very <unk> <unk> <unk> .
We 're trying to <unk> the process .
So , this looks like the <unk> of a <unk> <unk> .
When we start these <unk> <unk> <unk> , we 're more than 100 <unk> <unk> , you don 't get to be <unk> to the <unk> <unk> .
You get to the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> biology .
So we have <unk> other <unk> .
<unk> of another <unk> called <unk> <unk> , which biology <unk> to <unk> the DNA that can <unk> the <unk> .
Here 's an example .
This <unk> , called <unk> <unk> , can <unk> three million <unk> <unk> .
You can see in the <unk> <unk> as its <unk> is <unk> .
<unk> -- 24 hours it 's <unk> exactly like it was before .
<unk> thousands of organisms that are able to do that .
These organisms can completely <unk> .
We 're going to live under <unk> .
I 'm absolutely sure that life <unk> in space , and <unk> to find new <unk> of water .
<unk> , NASA <unk> showed that this is going on .
This is an image of the <unk> that we 've built these <unk> , just using these <unk> , just using the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> <unk> .
This image was not <unk> with a <unk> <unk> , but with a <unk> <unk> .
It 's a <unk> so big <unk> that we can <unk> with a <unk> <unk> .
These are <unk> <unk> a <unk> of about six seconds .
This is the <unk> we did a little time ago .
They are more than <unk> <unk> code .
It 's the largest <unk> of a <unk> <unk> <unk> ever <unk> from man .
It has a <unk> <unk> <unk> to 300 million .
If you <unk> it with a <unk> 10 <unk> without spaces , you 're going to take pages this <unk> code .
Now , how do we do it work ? How can we <unk> it ?
<unk> , <unk> <unk> is a <unk> of kids .
It 's a little bit more <unk> when you use of the bacteria .
It 's more <unk> , even when it 's about <unk> cells as our : you can just <unk> the <unk> and <unk> another , which is basically the <unk> process .
In <unk> , <unk> <unk> is <unk> into the cell , but we have <unk> <unk> that we 're able to do a <unk> <unk> of a <unk> cell to another cell cell to another and <unk> .
We <unk> a <unk> <unk> from a <unk> species .
<unk> are different as the men are <unk> .
We <unk> some <unk> <unk> in a way that we could decide what you 're going to do .
And then he <unk> with the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And when we put it in the cell was <unk> and <unk> our <unk> the <unk> new <unk> <unk> went into the cell .
And I 'm <unk> that we don 't go beyond , but we tried to <unk> more .
This is one of the biggest <unk> of evolution .
We found that <unk> species have <unk> a second or a third <unk> <unk> from some part , <unk> in a second thousands of new <unk> to that species .
So who think evolution evolution as a <unk> <unk> at the time you <unk> the <unk> that <unk> has no <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> that was in the cell cell <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> we <unk> the <unk> .
It 's <unk> , and he <unk> the other <unk> as <unk> material , <unk> it , and we <unk> it with only the cell and the new <unk> .
It 's become blue because of the genes that we <unk> .
And in a short <unk> of time , all the <unk> of a species are <unk> go <unk> , and it 's <unk> of all over in a new species , <unk> on the new software that we <unk> in the cell .
All the <unk> are <unk> , <unk> are <unk> , and when we <unk> the code <unk> <unk> exactly to what we have <unk> .
Now , this could be <unk> <unk> , but we can <unk> the software , but we can change the <unk> things in a pretty <unk> .
Now , I 've been <unk> here that you don 't talk about <unk> -- but <unk> <unk> <unk> -- but <unk> <unk> <unk> , and I already said that maybe we 're going to create a new version of <unk> <unk> in which we 're <unk> new species to this <unk> <unk> .
Why do that ?
I think it 's pretty <unk> when we think about our <unk> .
We 're going to get six and a half billion people in the next 40 years .
Just to give one example : I was born in <unk> .
Now there are three people on the planet to <unk> <unk> in <unk> ; in 40 years , there 's four .
We 're <unk> problems now to find food , <unk> and <unk> and <unk> for six billion and a half and a half billion people .
We 're going to get to do it for nine billion .
<unk> more than five billion <unk> , more than 30 billion <unk> .
That means percent <unk> a day .
When we try to find <unk> <unk> , or any kind of <unk> <unk> , it will be a huge challenge .
In more we have to realize all the <unk> of CO2 <unk> from these materials that <unk> in the atmosphere .
At day , <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> around the world , we have a <unk> with about 20 genes , and I like to think that are the <unk> <unk> for the future .
<unk> industry , just a <unk> about <unk> , and think about how many different things are <unk> .
Our <unk> here are <unk> data from reality and our imagination .
Now we have <unk> , because of these <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> to create what we call <unk> <unk> .
We 're able to build a big robot that can produce a million <unk> a day .
Think about <unk> these 20 million genes or <unk> to <unk> <unk> to produce <unk> or <unk> , new <unk> , we can change , because of the small <unk> , and create more biology now that over the last 20 years of science .
And it 's just a standard <unk> .
We can choose to <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
This is a <unk> of some software <unk> that we 're working on to be able to <unk> and <unk> species to the computer .
Well , we don 't know how they 're going to be .
We know exactly what their <unk> code .
We 're <unk> on the <unk> <unk> .
You 've seen that <unk> <unk> from the <unk> was a <unk> experiment .
We have <unk> second and third generation that we 're going to be soon from the <unk> to <unk> more <unk> like <unk> or different kinds of <unk> .
But the only way that biology can have a big impact without <unk> the cost of food and <unk> the <unk> would be <unk> the CO2 in the <unk> of food and <unk> the <unk> would be <unk> to this <unk> to <unk> that can get this purpose , and we think we can have the first <unk> of <unk> in about 18 months .
<unk> light <unk> with CO2 is a <unk> , but in our <unk> , and we found different <unk> .
This is a <unk> we <unk> in <unk> .
<unk> in the ocean , at about <unk> feet <unk> to the temperature of water .
<unk> <unk> from CO2 using hydrogen <unk> as <unk> energy .
We 're trying to understand if we can <unk> CO2 , which can be <unk> by <unk> , <unk> that CO2 in <unk> , to drive this process .
So , we think we might be able to <unk> what the basic question of " which is what the <unk> is what the life is , we <unk> , we <unk> the <unk> goal of <unk> the whole <unk> industry .
<unk> . If you can 't do it from TED , where can you ?
It <unk> a main source of energy .
And we 're working working on using the same <unk> to create <unk> .
You 've seen this year with the flu , we always 're back to a year and with a dollar in less when it 's about finding the right <unk> .
I think what you can change building <unk> <unk> .
And here 's how the future could start <unk> , now , the tree of evolution , <unk> evolution with bacteria <unk> , <unk> , <unk> cells .
We 're <unk> so much about the <unk> people .
Our purpose is to do enough to live enough long to try to <unk> . Thank you very much .
<unk> I 'm going to show you , the <unk> <unk> possible , some <unk> work , the new technology that we 've brought to <unk> to a <unk> almost a year ago . This is <unk> .
It 's a environment where you can <unk> is at the local level that <unk> with a huge amount of data .
Here we 're seeing <unk> <unk> <unk> with a kind of <unk> <unk> and <unk> , for a <unk> <unk> , <unk> the images as we want .
And it doesn 't matter how big the amount of information that we see , how big these <unk> are these <unk> data or <unk> .
Most of them are common photographs , but this is a <unk> <unk> from the <unk> of <unk> , and <unk> in the <unk> of 300 <unk> .
It doesn 't make any difference because the only thing that <unk> the <unk> of a system like this is the number of <unk> on your screen in any time . It 's also a very <unk> architecture .
This is a whole book , example of data , <unk> of data .
This is the <unk> <unk> <unk> . Every <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
To <unk> that it 's just about the text and not <unk> , we can do something like that , to actually see that it 's a real <unk> <unk> of the text , not a picture .
It could be a little bit <unk> to read a <unk> book .
I don 't <unk> .
This is an example more <unk> . It 's a number of <unk> .
Every big image is the beginning of a <unk> .
And it really gives you the pleasure and the <unk> experience of the real version of a <unk> or a <unk> , which is for nature a <unk> kind of a <unk> .
We also did something with the corner of this particular number of <unk> .
We created a <unk> <unk> <unk> much more than the <unk> <unk> than the <unk> <unk> , and we <unk> the <unk> content .
If you want to see the <unk> of this <unk> , you can see here .
Or other models , or even <unk> <unk> .
And this really <unk> some of these ideas to <unk> the <unk> of space on the screen .
We thought this <unk> to put into the <unk> and other <unk> <unk> , no longer being <unk> .
Of course , the <unk> is one of the most <unk> <unk> for this kind of technology .
And on this one , I don 't want to lose time , if we don 't know that we have <unk> to do this field .
These are all the <unk> in the United States <unk> over a <unk> image .
So now I 'm going to start something else .
This is actually now live on the Web ; you can see it .
It 's a project called <unk> , which <unk> two different technologies .
One is <unk> and the other is a very interesting research that was made by <unk> <unk> <unk> , a student of Washington , with the help of <unk> <unk> <unk> . A <unk> <unk> <unk> . A <unk> <unk> . A <unk> <unk> . A <unk> <unk> .
And it 's alive on the Web , <unk> <unk> .
You can <unk> when we do this kind of <unk> , where we can go from an image to the other , and have this kind of experience <unk> .
But the <unk> <unk> of the images here has actually a meaning .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> have been <unk> these images together , so that we 're <unk> to <unk> all <unk> near the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> have been <unk> . And here here you see some <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> , and these things are all <unk> .
I don 't know if I have time to show you some other environment .
There are a lot more <unk> .
I want to go directly to one of the <unk> of <unk> data and this <unk> from a <unk> <unk> that we 've done for the first time , I was going to show you the <unk> of the <unk> of this technology , <unk> technology . And <unk> is not <unk> so much as I look at the <unk> that we 're going to be in the website .
We had to <unk> <unk> and so forth .
This is a <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . And he 's <unk> of these <unk> <unk> , and so forth . You know , these <unk> <unk> <unk> an image that 's going to be a <unk> <unk> .
So I 'm all <unk> images from <unk> and they 're all <unk> <unk> to the <unk> .
And it 's possible to <unk> this <unk> way .
You know , I 'd never thought I 'd never been thinking about work .
It 's very <unk> <unk> <unk> this kind of <unk> here .
I think I think you 're going to see that 's a lot of different <unk> : from those <unk> <unk> , a <unk> number , <unk> together in this environment .
And if I can , I can <unk> to look at the <unk> .
<unk> are <unk> by <unk> , etc .
<unk> here is a series of photographs -- <unk> .
This is a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
We can go from the physics of this environment .
The <unk> point is that we can do with social environment . This is now <unk> data from the whole memory of how to <unk> the Earth , from the <unk> <unk> , from the <unk> point of view and <unk> all of that data together .
All those pictures become <unk> together , more than the <unk> of the <unk> .
You have a model of the whole <unk> that <unk> .
Think of this as the <unk> of the work of <unk> <unk> on Earth .
It 's something that <unk> <unk> of how people <unk> it , and the <unk> that you 're going to <unk> it with the use .
Their <unk> are <unk> with <unk> by other people .
If someone comes the idea of <unk> all of these <unk> <unk> the name , my <unk> picture of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> all of those data , and I can use it as a <unk> of <unk> to <unk> in that space , <unk> , using the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> .
Of course , a <unk> of all interesting <unk> models of all interesting <unk> of every interesting part of the Earth , <unk> not only to <unk> and <unk> images , but from the memory .
<unk> <unk> .
Chris Anderson : I <unk> ? What your software is going to take you to do is that at some point , in the next few years , all the <unk> <unk> from anybody in the world will be <unk> together ?
<unk> : Yes . What 's doing is , it 's actually <unk> .
It 's creating <unk> , if you want , in images .
And he 's doing it , it 's <unk> .
The thing becomes very interesting if you think about the <unk> of information <unk> that many of these <unk> images .
As you do a <unk> <unk> and the <unk> , you <unk> a <unk> and the text on the page has a lot of information about the images of the images of this .
Now , what happens if that <unk> you get to all your <unk> ?
So the amount of <unk> <unk> and the amount of <unk> that is really huge . It 's a <unk> effect . It 's a <unk> effect of the network .
CA : <unk> , it 's really amazing . <unk> .
<unk> : I 'm going to talk a lot .
One of the main <unk> when you <unk> and one of the <unk> <unk> is that we can live in who don 't have <unk> <unk> <unk> , in the past <unk> , <unk> the past <unk> the <unk> of plants .
<unk> to think that <unk> <unk> <unk> still beyond the <unk> <unk> , or that the <unk> <unk> are still <unk> <unk> , or that in <unk> , <unk> <unk> still the <unk> of <unk> , or <unk> , <unk> <unk> still the <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> , and that the idea that the world in which we live in in which we don 't have a <unk> sense , but it 's just a <unk> of reality , but it 's just a <unk> of reality .
the <unk> of a particular <unk> of <unk> choices that our <unk> has done , good or bad , many <unk> .
And , of course , all <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> . <unk> <unk> .
We 're <unk> <unk> .
We have to deal with the <unk> of death , so we don 't <unk> it and <unk> --
We all have a art .
What <unk> is the particular <unk> of the song , the <unk> of <unk> every culture .
It doesn 't matter that are the <unk> of <unk> , or the <unk> of <unk> <unk> , or the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> , or a <unk> in <unk> <unk> , or a <unk> in the heart of <unk> .
He was my <unk> <unk> a month ago , or a <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> mother 's <unk> 's <unk> .
All of these <unk> <unk> that there are other ways of <unk> other ways of thinking , other ways of moving in the world .
And , if you <unk> a minute , it 's a concept that can give you hope .
<unk> , the <unk> <unk> of the world <unk> create a <unk> of <unk> life and <unk> that <unk> the planet and important for the <unk> of the planet , as the <unk> <unk> <unk> as <unk> .
And you can think about this <unk> <unk> as a <unk> and you can <unk> the <unk> of all the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> to be in being by the human imagination of the <unk> .
<unk> is the <unk> <unk> of humanity .
It 's the <unk> of what we are and what we can be as as a <unk> species .
And <unk> the <unk> was <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , for example , <unk> that 50 percent of all the species was or is on the <unk> of the <unk> , just because it 's <unk> , or -- in the <unk> <unk> <unk> -- and you don 't even even even even a little bit of <unk> -- the <unk> <unk> <unk> -- and you don 't even even even even even <unk> to the <unk> <unk> -- the <unk> of the diversity .
The <unk> of all that is , of course , <unk> <unk> .
When you 're <unk> <unk> <unk> on this planet .
A language is not just <unk> by a <unk> or a series of <unk> rules .
A language is the <unk> of the human spirit .
It 's the middle with which the <unk> of every culture comes into the world .
Every language is a forest of the mind , a <unk> , a thought of <unk> <unk> .
And of those <unk> <unk> , while we 're sitting here at least , not <unk> the <unk> is not <unk> in the <unk> of the children .
They 're not getting <unk> to children , which means less than something , which is that they 're already death .
What 's more <unk> than being <unk> by the <unk> , the last last to talk about a language , the last last to talk about a language , of not <unk> the <unk> of <unk> or <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> or <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the
This <unk> <unk> was the state of someone in the world every two weeks : every two weeks : every two weeks : every two weeks , a <unk> <unk> and <unk> with it in the <unk> <unk> .
And I know someone of you <unk> " <unk> 't that much better ?
The world would not be a better place if you all the same language ? " <unk> , then we all <unk> . <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , what it means that you can 't talk about their language .
I 'd like to give you a journey through the <unk> --
a small journey in the <unk> to give you a <unk> of what we 're <unk> .
Most of us <unk> that when I say , " different ways of <unk> . "
<unk> for example , this <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , which <unk> <unk> <unk> from the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
It 's a <unk> that it 's not able to <unk> the blue color from the green because the <unk> is <unk> in the <unk> of the forest that we <unk> the <unk> .
They have a <unk> language and a <unk> rule , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> , though the <unk> is that in these <unk> families <unk> , and they 're talking about six or seven <unk> because of the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
You start to hear and then <unk> to talk about .
I had one of the most interesting <unk> I 've lived , the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , an incredible <unk> that had the first <unk> in <unk> .
In <unk> five <unk> have <unk> <unk> <unk> .
They did <unk> by the top photographs that <unk> them in <unk> <unk> , which this <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> had never seen anything .
They <unk> the <unk> <unk> with <unk> .
But <unk> <unk> not only <unk> .
They <unk> them .
<unk> percent <unk> <unk> was <unk> by themselves .
We 're <unk> to eight <unk> and we found two <unk> of death , and when we <unk> to know , they <unk> that one of them was so <unk> that he died , and then they <unk> it . It <unk> the same . [ <unk> ] <unk> , every way , they had an incredible knowledge of the forest .
<unk> were able to recognize the animal <unk> from 40 <unk> and <unk> the species .
<unk> <unk> , I was <unk> a very interesting job when my <unk> <unk> <unk> me if I wanted to go to <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> . If I wanted to go to <unk> in <unk> <unk> .
To give a sense of <unk> , I should have to understand the <unk> culture and that the <unk> is not <unk> <unk> .
It 's pretty much about a <unk> <unk> of the world .
Very interesting .
If you 're going to <unk> the big <unk> of the world , what do you do ?
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , etc . .
A continent comes out , thinking that Africa <unk> <unk> doesn 't have <unk> <unk> . And instead and <unk> is not the <unk> of these <unk> <unk> very <unk> <unk> <unk> during the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
What makes the <unk> is the <unk> of the <unk> of life and death .
So <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> can be <unk> by the <unk> <unk> , <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> and <unk> to the <unk> of the live in such a minute that for a short minute , the <unk> becomes the <unk> .
So , the <unk> <unk> to say , " <unk> <unk> go to <unk> to talk about God .
We <unk> in <unk> and <unk> God . "
And from the moment you 're <unk> , is the spirit that <unk> you can <unk> you , how bad about it ?
So , you start these incredible events : <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a pretty strong <unk> of the power of the body 's mind when it 's <unk> in a state of <unk> <unk> .
I <unk> all the <unk> that I 've lived with the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , in the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> of the <unk> civilization that once <unk> on the <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
In a <unk> continent , this <unk> has never been <unk> by <unk> .
<unk> today are <unk> by a <unk> , but their <unk> <unk> is extraordinary .
<unk> <unk> are <unk> by the families to three or four years , and they live in a world <unk> and <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> <unk> to the <unk> <unk> for 18 years .
Two <unk> <unk> <unk> .
For this time , they 're <unk> to the values of their society , values that <unk> their <unk> and only their <unk> <unk> <unk> -- or to say the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> of this incredible <unk> , they 're <unk> <unk> out and for the first time in their life , see a <unk> . And in that moment of <unk> of the first <unk> , when the sun <unk> <unk> <unk> , all they have been <unk> . And everything they have learned in theory in <unk> . <unk> . <unk> does <unk> . <unk> . <unk> does a <unk> <unk> . <unk> does a <unk> <unk> . <unk> does a <unk> <unk> and says ,
" <unk> ? I 'm going to talk about that .
It 's <unk> . Now it 's going to be <unk> . "
They 're <unk> <unk> and they say that we , <unk> <unk> , we 're the <unk> of the world 's <unk> .
This level of <unk> is extremely important .
When we think about <unk> <unk> and the <unk> <unk> and the <unk> <unk> <unk> , which is a <unk> concept in its <unk> <unk> or maybe <unk> <unk> and say that these <unk> are closer to Earth .
<unk> <unk> are not <unk> or <unk> <unk> .
There 's no space for these things in the <unk> <unk> of <unk> or in the <unk> <unk> , but because of time and <unk> , they have created a <unk> of Earth <unk> <unk> , but on a <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> , but on a <unk> <unk> <unk> , but on a <unk> <unk> <unk> . But the concept that the <unk> of human consciousness .
What does it mean ?
I mean that a <unk> of the <unk> that <unk> <unk> the mountain is a <unk> <unk> that <unk> the <unk> is going to be a human <unk> <unk> and will have a <unk> different relationship with the mountain or that <unk> to <unk> <unk> that <unk> a mountain of <unk> is a <unk> <unk> to be <unk> .
which is the <unk> of one spirit or a <unk> <unk> is <unk> .
What 's interesting is the <unk> that <unk> the relationship between <unk> and the natural world .
I grew up in the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to be <unk> .
And that made me a human being different from my friends who believe that <unk> are the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> who live in the <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of the world , <unk> that <unk> in the <unk> <unk> .
If you start <unk> that these <unk> can create <unk> different , we start to understand some of them <unk> .
I <unk> this picture to <unk> in <unk> <unk> .
Maybe some of you have heard about the <unk> , the most powerful <unk> <unk> .
What makes the <unk> is not the potential <unk> of <unk> , but its <unk> . It 's <unk> by two elements .
On one side , this <unk> <unk> <unk> a series of <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
<unk> the only <unk> <unk> a little bit of the <unk> <unk> , but it 's <unk> with the <unk> of a <unk> of the family <unk> said <unk> .
This <unk> <unk> <unk> , very similar to <unk> , <unk> .
If you 're going to see the <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> , which are doing a different <unk> of species , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> that <unk> <unk> is a little bit like being <unk> by a <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> on a sea of electricity . <unk> . <unk> 't create a <unk> of electricity . It doesn 't create a <unk> of reality ; it 's <unk> .
I often <unk> with my <unk> , Richard <unk> <unk> , the man who <unk> the <unk> was <unk> , with his discovery of <unk> <unk> in the <unk> .
My <unk> is not <unk> these <unk> as you 're <unk> , because if you 're <unk> , you can 't tell nobody to be <unk> . <unk> , but they can 't be <unk> because they 're <unk> by a <unk> that 's <unk> in the <unk> , <unk> .
It 's possible <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Now , the <unk> is the <unk> that are <unk> in this <unk> are <unk> <unk> , the same necessary to <unk> . The question <unk> <unk> : in a <unk> of <unk> species , how are these <unk> <unk> <unk> are not similar to <unk> , but that if you <unk> this <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , they don 't like that , but if you <unk> , they create a <unk> version of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> ?
We use the <unk> <unk> of <unk> and <unk> , which can <unk> <unk> .
But if you <unk> , we 're going to <unk> us to <unk> , " <unk> " <unk> " . "
What does it mean ?
This <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , which <unk> <unk> in the forest , and that our eyes <unk> in the same species .
If the <unk> like <unk> their <unk> <unk> <unk> us , " <unk> " <unk> " <unk> " <unk> " <unk> " <unk> " <unk> " <unk> " <unk> " No . "
The solution is : they take <unk> <unk> in a night night <unk> <unk> <unk> with a different <unk> .
With this doesn 't <unk> <unk> , but it 's much more interesting than <unk> <unk> .
Now , [ <unk> ] the problem is that even the ones of us who have to the heart <unk> are <unk> them , but <unk> <unk> to the <unk> of history than our real world , and <unk> .
In fact , the <unk> century , in 300 years , not <unk> <unk> for its <unk> or its <unk> <unk> , but rather like the was where we <unk> and <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> diversity and <unk> and <unk> . Now the problem is not the change .
All the <unk> through the <unk> have been <unk> in a <unk> for new possibilities .
And the problem is not technology .
<unk> <unk> have no <unk> to be <unk> when they <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> as the <unk> have no <unk> to be <unk> when they <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
It 's not the change or technology that <unk> the <unk> of <unk> . It 's the power .
The <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And if you <unk> a look at the world , you know , you know , you don 't know , <unk> .
They are <unk> creatures and <unk> <unk> out of the <unk> forces that go beyond their <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> --
a <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , a <unk> that <unk> <unk> in the forest to a generation ago , and now <unk> to the <unk> and now <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> , where you can see the <unk> <unk> from the <unk> that looks like <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> to the <unk> with the forest <unk> .
Or , in the case of <unk> , are the disease that are <unk> with the <unk> discovery of <unk> .
If you <unk> on the <unk> of the <unk> , where I 'm doing a lot of research , you 'll see the <unk> <unk> of politics .
As <unk> <unk> , <unk> physics of a <unk> , is <unk> <unk> to <unk> , but <unk> , <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> , not only is <unk> , but <unk> <unk> in certain <unk> , because it 's part of the development of development .
And you can 't understand the <unk> of the <unk> until you go .
I <unk> <unk> miles from <unk> in China , through the <unk> <unk> , <unk> to <unk> with a young <unk> , but only come to <unk> with a young <unk> , but only the <unk> I have to <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> million people <unk> from the <unk> <unk> during the <unk> <unk> .
The father of this guy was <unk> at <unk> <unk> .
which means that it was <unk> to the <unk> of Chinese <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
My mother was <unk> and his <unk> was <unk> .
It was taken of <unk> <unk> at the age of two <unk> years <unk> , he was <unk> , because he couldn 't live without him .
The <unk> , who did the same , was <unk> in <unk> <unk> .
One day he <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> and , for this <unk> , was <unk> to the <unk> work for seven years .
The pain of <unk> can be <unk> , but the <unk> <unk> <unk> is from the present .
<unk> , all <unk> to a choice .
We 're going to live in the <unk> world , or we want to <unk> the <unk> world of diversity ?
The big <unk> <unk> <unk> , before he died said that his greatest fear was that , in our <unk> to this <unk> <unk> of the world , not only <unk> the whole <unk> of human imagination to <unk> a <unk> <unk> of thinking , but a day we <unk> a <unk> <unk> of thinking that there were other possibilities .
And it 's <unk> to remember that our species is <unk> for <unk> years .
<unk> <unk> , which <unk> us <unk> to <unk> , which <unk> us to the <unk> of the <unk> , <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> with the <unk> of <unk> , creating the <unk> of <unk> , creating the <unk> of <unk> .
The <unk> world has <unk> 300 years .
That <unk> story , I didn 't know that we have the answers to all the challenges that we 're going to <unk> .
When these <unk> <unk> of the world 's <unk> , what it means to be human , <unk> with <unk> <unk> different .
And it 's in these answers that we all <unk> the possibility of being what we are , a <unk> species , which has to <unk> all the <unk> and all the <unk> can <unk> . And there are big moments of <unk> .
I <unk> this picture on the <unk> <unk> of <unk> , when I went to <unk> <unk> with <unk> , and this man , <unk> , <unk> me the wonderful story of his <unk> .
The <unk> government was not always <unk> with the <unk> <unk> and in the ' <unk> to <unk> our <unk> , we <unk> them in <unk> .
The <unk> of this man <unk> <unk> .
<unk> , <unk> for his life , <unk> <unk> <unk> all the <unk> , and all its <unk> .
You want to know that <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> it .
<unk> <unk> were made of <unk> fish <unk> in the skin of <unk> .
The <unk> of this man didn 't <unk> by night or <unk> <unk> .
It 's <unk> away , it 's <unk> the <unk> <unk> and <unk> in your hand . When I did it <unk> , he 's <unk> it . When I did it <unk> it , he 's <unk> it .
He <unk> <unk> on the <unk> of this <unk> <unk> and when <unk> <unk> , he <unk> a dog .
He <unk> the dog and created a <unk> , with the <unk> <unk> <unk> created a <unk> , has <unk> another dog , and it 's <unk> on the <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
<unk> to talk about <unk> ? <unk> . And that , in different ways , [ <unk> ] [ is the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and all the <unk> <unk> of the world .
<unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> government <unk> to <unk> the <unk> of an area of <unk> <unk> <unk> .
It 's their new <unk> . It 's called <unk> .
It 's a <unk> <unk> . We <unk> all the <unk> resources .
One <unk> example of how a <unk> can <unk> with its <unk> .
And , to end , I think it 's pretty <unk> at least who we have been in these <unk> areas of the planet , <unk> that are not <unk> .
For someone is <unk> .
<unk> <unk> of the human imagination that <unk> to the <unk> of the time . And for all , the dreams of these children , like our children , as the <unk> of the hope .
<unk> , we <unk> <unk> , we <unk> <unk> , we <unk> that <unk> never <unk> .
I think <unk> --
<unk> are not <unk> , but we believe that stories can change the world , and maybe we are the best <unk> to tell the stories of the world . Every month our <unk> site <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> our <unk> <unk> .
Our <unk> are <unk> by millions of people .
Our work is <unk> to <unk> our <unk> to bring our public in places that <unk> <unk> from which <unk> <unk> from how they saw and , they <unk> , they <unk> , <unk> for the central <unk> of <unk> : the world 's <unk> to <unk> in the diversity , and we have to find a <unk> world in <unk> and <unk> . And we have to find a <unk> world . And we have to find a <unk> and <unk>
where the <unk> of all <unk> can <unk> to our <unk> <unk> .
Thank you .
I 'm going to talk about some things that I 've written in this book that you 've heard about and <unk> some <unk> , in the case you don 't know .
I want to start with what I call " <unk> <unk> . "
<unk> <unk> ?
The <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> : " If we want to <unk> our citizens " <unk> " The way we want to do it is <unk> the freedom to do it is <unk> freedom . "
The reason is , on the side , in fact that freedom is <unk> is <unk> , <unk> , <unk> for human beings .
<unk> else is in fact that if we 're <unk> , each of us can act to do everything that <unk> our <unk> , without nobody who <unk> in our own name .
The way to <unk> the freedom is to <unk> .
<unk> <unk> people have , more <unk> , and more , and more is their <unk> , and more is their <unk> .
This is , <unk> , it 's so <unk> <unk> in society that nobody <unk> to <unk> .
And it 's also <unk> <unk> in our lives .
I 'm going to show you some examples of what progress has made possible .
This is my <unk> . It 's not particularly big .
I <unk> a simple note on the <unk> to <unk> .
In my <unk> , there are <unk> <unk> , without <unk> the 10 <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and 12 <unk> <unk> that you can buy for a huge number of <unk> <unk> in the <unk> that no one of the <unk> <unk> is <unk> of your <unk> .
That 's what the <unk> is .
Then you go to the <unk> <unk> to buy a <unk> : <unk> , <unk> , radio , <unk> , <unk> .
And in this single <unk> <unk> , there 's a big number of <unk> <unk> .
We can do six and a half million different <unk> using the <unk> that there are in one <unk> .
<unk> <unk> that there is <unk> choice .
<unk> <unk> : the world of <unk> .
Once , when I was a child , you could get all the <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
You <unk> the phone , you don 't <unk> it .
A <unk> of that , between the other , was that the phone never <unk> .
These days are gone .
We have a <unk> almost <unk> <unk> , especially in cell phones .
Here 's the <unk> cell phones .
My <unk> is that in the middle , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
If you don 't have it yet in the store under the house , you 're very <unk> that soon <unk> .
And what the end is that people <unk> in <unk> and does this question . And you know , is the answer ? The answer is " No . "
It 's not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn 't face .
So , in other <unk> of life that are much more important than <unk> , <unk> the same <unk> of choices .
<unk> <unk> : <unk> is not going on on the United States that you 're <unk> from <unk> and the <unk> you have to do .
Instead , <unk> from the <unk> , and the <unk> says , " OK , we can do it . " <unk> , we can do it . " And then these <unk> " <unk> have these <unk> and these <unk> . What do you want to do ? "
You <unk> him : " <unk> , what do you do ? "
And the <unk> says , " <unk> has these <unk> and these <unk> , and <unk> has these <unk> and these <unk> . "
" What do you want to do ? "
And you say , " <unk> if you were me , what would you say ? "
And the <unk> : " But I 'm not her . "
We call the <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> that makes it look like a <unk> thing .
But , it 's not that a <unk> <unk> and <unk> of taking decisions from someone who knows something , you know , <unk> the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and almost of course , is <unk> -- and almost of course , is <unk> -- and it 's not in the <unk> to take the patient .
There 's a huge <unk> of <unk> products , <unk> to people like me and you , if you think about it doesn 't make sense , because we can 't <unk> .
But if we can 't <unk> , why do we <unk> them ?
The answer is they want to <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> of the fundamental <unk> , as we have now is a question of choice , as you see in this <unk> . " We don 't want to <unk> kids . <unk> their sex at the right . " It 's not <unk> a <unk> : we have to <unk> .
And we can <unk> how many times we <unk> .
which means that every <unk> , <unk> , you have to decide that kind of person , you have to decide that kind of person .
<unk> to the family and <unk> , a time perspective perspective , almost almost to anyone , was that you <unk> the <unk> as soon as possible , and you <unk> to <unk> the <unk> as soon as possible .
The only only choice was with who , not when , and not , and you know what to do later .
<unk> , all is really to play .
<unk> to <unk> students very smart , and they <unk> them , 20 percent less work than a time .
And not because they 're less <unk> , because they 're not <unk> .
but why I 'm <unk> , I 'm going to <unk> or not ? "
" <unk> <unk> <unk> later ? " I have to think about <unk> or to the career ? "
They 're <unk> <unk> .
And they try to answer these questions , even if this <unk> is not <unk> the <unk> that <unk> and not get a beautiful <unk> to my <unk> .
And they have to do that . They are important questions .
Now , the work : we 're <unk> , as <unk> <unk> , because the technology <unk> us to work every minute , every day , from every day , from every day , <unk> on the planet , <unk> from the <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , there 's a <unk> , and I 'm not going to say , where the <unk> works .
I don 't say that , because I want to use it .
What does , this incredible <unk> of choice that we have about this ? It 's that we have to decide , <unk> at any moment , if we have to work or no .
We can go to see our son to play <unk> , with the phone in a <unk> , the <unk> in the other , and the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
And even if I 'm all <unk> , every minute we see our son <unk> , we 're also <unk> , " I have to answer this call ? "
" I have to <unk> this <unk> ? I have to <unk> this letter ? "
And even when the answer is , " no , that makes the experience of your <unk> very different from what it would be in other conditions .
So , from any <unk> , we look , and big things , little objects and <unk> , life is a question of choices .
Once the world was this : <unk> , there were some possibilities , but it was not a question of choice .
The world today today is <unk> to this : <unk> is a <unk> thing , or <unk> ?
The answer is <unk> .
<unk> <unk> we all know , so I 'm going to talk about the <unk> .
We 're going to <unk> this choice <unk> .
The first , <unk> , is that it <unk> <unk> instead of <unk> .
With many <unk> between which you choose , it 's very hard to do .
I 'm going to give you an example : a <unk> study <unk> <unk> .
My <unk> had <unk> to <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> society , <unk> <unk> <unk> , with about a million <unk> <unk> in <unk> .
What she discovered is that for every 10 solutions that are <unk> more , the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
With 50 <unk> <unk> , there 's 10 percent in less than when they 're available . Why ?
Because with 50 <unk> <unk> , which you have to <unk> , and the choice is <unk> .
And <unk> , and again , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and of course , <unk> never <unk> .
<unk> that doesn 't mean that it doesn 't mean that these <unk> <unk> food to <unk> because they don 't have enough money , it also wants to say that the <unk> <unk> <unk> of work .
<unk> : <unk> , they 're <unk> to <unk> <unk> per year from the <unk> of work , which would be well <unk> .
So the <unk> is a <unk> of <unk> choices .
And I think we 're going to <unk> the world .
" And to end , to <unk> : <unk> , <unk> or <unk> ? "
You have to take the right decision , if it 's for <unk> , right ?
You don 't want to choose the bottom , and you 're going to get the <unk> wrong .
So this is the first effect . The second is that even if we can <unk> <unk> and make a choice , at the end , we 're less <unk> by the result , we 're less <unk> by <unk> between .
And that for several reasons .
One of these is that with many <unk> between which you choose , if you 're going to <unk> one and it 's not perfect , it 's easy to to <unk> . And what happens is that the <unk> <unk> <unk> us to <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> <unk> from <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> <unk> from <unk> decision , and the <unk> <unk> <unk> from the <unk> decision , and the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
even when it was a decision .
<unk> choices are <unk> , it 's easier to <unk> any <unk> that <unk> is <unk> of <unk> choice .
<unk> , there 's what <unk> call <unk> .
Dan <unk> has <unk> very well <unk> as the value that we give the value of what we <unk> .
<unk> rest , when there are many <unk> , it 's easy to <unk> the <unk> <unk> of <unk> and being less <unk> than the <unk> <unk> that you have choice .
Here 's an example . I 'm <unk> with all the ones that are not in New York .
But that 's probably <unk> .
There 's this <unk> <unk> .
A <unk> <unk> .
<unk> . <unk> day . It 's all for them .
It doesn 't <unk> anything . But what he thinks is , " Well , <unk> , it 's <unk> . "
" All my <unk> <unk> are away . "
" <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . "
And two weeks , I 'm going to talk about <unk> -- every day -- the <unk> of <unk> where it wants .
The <unk> <unk> <unk> for what we have , even when the choice was <unk> .
And the <unk> are <unk> we have from <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> us against how <unk> .
Here 's another example .
This <unk> tells us a lot of things .
It 's about the moment , and maybe in the <unk> of living .
But the most important point is that whatever you 're <unk> , you 're going to be <unk> .
The things that don 't <unk> have many <unk> that can make less <unk> what we do .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> <unk> .
I tried it on my skin <unk> a new couple of <unk> .
It was almost always <unk> .
Once the <unk> were just like , and <unk> them and <unk> them from <unk> , were <unk> , only after <unk> , they were <unk> , only after <unk> a lot of times , and <unk> to go .
So , I started <unk> a new when the <unk> were gone , and I said , " I need a couple of <unk> , this is my <unk> . "
The <unk> said , " <unk> wants to <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> ? "
<unk> wants to <unk> or <unk> ? " <unk> " <unk> " or " <unk> " ? "
" <unk> wants them <unk> ? "
" <unk> <unk> wants to <unk> them or <unk> ? <unk> <unk> <unk> -- " <unk> .
I was <unk> , and after a little bit of I was able to say , " I want the guy to be , " I 'm the only guy , so for a time time now , I <unk> all <unk> <unk> <unk> , and then I <unk> it , with the best of <unk> I had ever had .
It was the <unk> . With all that choice I had <unk> the best .
But I 'm going to <unk> .
Why ? I wrote a whole book to <unk> .
The reason I was worse is that with all that choice my <unk> were <unk> , <unk> <unk> to be <unk> .
I had <unk> <unk> . I didn 't <unk> me . I 'm not going to do it , I just had to be a <unk> . But when we <unk> 100 different , <unk> , at least one guy had to be perfect .
What I had <unk> was good , but not perfect .
After I <unk> that I <unk> with what I was <unk> in <unk> .
<unk> <unk> in the lives of the people who don 't do that <unk> the <unk> that these have <unk> <unk> .
And this <unk> <unk> , even when the results are good .
<unk> in the world 's <unk> if you realize that .
Because if you <unk> it , I don 't know what I 'm talking about .
The truth <unk> more .
And he was better when he was worse , " The reason he was better when he was <unk> when he was worse is that when he was worse is possible .
<unk> , in the world that we live in -- <unk> , <unk> with the <unk> of <unk> -- the <unk> that we can <unk> is that things are <unk> to the <unk> of <unk> .
You never have never been <unk> <unk> , because your <unk> , my <unk> , <unk> .
The <unk> of happiness -- what you 're here -- is , " <unk> <unk> " Yes , you want to . "
I mean , little <unk> moment -- which I 'm really <unk> and my wife is really <unk> .
I couldn 't do better , I didn 't <unk> me .
But it 's not always a <unk> thing .
<unk> , a <unk> of a <unk> <unk> when there 's only that you have that when you 're not <unk> , and you say , " Why ? "
Who is <unk> ? " <unk> is <unk> . "
The world is <unk> . What I could you do ?
When there are hundreds of kinds of <unk> , and I 'm going to get a <unk> , and you 're <unk> who 's the <unk> , it 's clear that the <unk> you 're you .
We could do better .
<unk> hundreds of <unk> available , there are no <unk> for <unk> .
So when people make decisions , even if the <unk> is <unk> , they <unk> and give their <unk> .
In the last few years , the <unk> world .
I think a <unk> <unk> -- not the only , but important -- of this <unk> <unk> is just that people have <unk> experiences because the standard standard are too <unk> .
And when they have to <unk> this situation think that <unk> is they 're <unk> .
So the final result is that we 're better , <unk> , but we 're going to be worse .
Let me show you .
This is the <unk> <unk> , what we all take for good and it 's completely <unk> . It 's not true .
There 's no <unk> that a little bit of choice is better than not <unk> , but it 's not going to be a lot of choice is better a little bit .
There 's a <unk> value , <unk> . I don 't know what it is .
But I 'm pretty sure we have <unk> from a piece of the level where the choices <unk> our life .
Now , from the <unk> <unk> -- I 'm almost almost finished -- from the <unk> <unk> , <unk> is the <unk> .
What <unk> all this choice in the <unk> society is <unk> material .
There are many places in the world , and you know , you know , where the problem is not that they have <unk> choice .
The problem is they have too <unk> .
So the <unk> of which I 'm talking about is a <unk> <unk> of <unk> , <unk> society .
And what <unk> does <unk> and <unk> is this : <unk> <unk> <unk> you yesterday about how those <unk> and <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> . It 's a <unk> of money .
I mean , these choices , <unk> and <unk> , it 's not that they 're just <unk> .
They 're <unk> <unk> .
They do worse .
If a little bit of what our society is <unk> choice was <unk> in those where people have too few people , it wouldn 't be their life to <unk> but even our <unk> .
This is what <unk> call a <unk> <unk> .
A <unk> of income does good for everybody -- not just the poor people -- because of this choice in <unk> that <unk> us .
<unk> <unk> : " <unk> , you can become everything you want to --
<unk> , people of culture , <unk> : " What <unk> that fish ? "
It 's <unk> that you can 't get anything in a <unk> of glass . "
" A <unk> imagination , a <unk> <unk> vision of the world --
and I <unk> it up with this , at the beginning .
But then , <unk> , instead , I realized that that the fish knows that that the long long one knows .
Because the reality of the <unk> is that if you <unk> the <unk> , so that it 's possible , " you don 't <unk> the freedom . You <unk> the <unk> .
If you <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> .
<unk> need a <unk> .
This is almost certainly too <unk> , maybe even for the fish , and certainly for us .
But the <unk> of some <unk> <unk> is a <unk> for <unk> and , for <unk> .
Thank you very much .
