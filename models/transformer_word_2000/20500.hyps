<unk> year I showed these <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> , which for almost three million years has had the size of the United States <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
We 're going to <unk> this <unk> of the problem because it doesn 't show the ice <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> is , in a way , the heart <unk> of climate change .
It 's <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
The next <unk> is going to be a <unk> <unk> on the <unk> of the last 25 years .
The <unk> <unk> are <unk> in red .
You see , you 're <unk> up to the blue <unk> .
That 's the ice in <unk> , which is <unk> in the summer .
You can see that the <unk> ice <unk> , of five years or more , it 's like the blood , that 's <unk> from the body .
In 25 years , in this way , in 25 years .
This is a problem because the <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> around the ocean , where there are huge <unk> of <unk> that , <unk> , are <unk> in <unk> from <unk> .
<unk> to the <unk> of the global <unk> , that <unk> <unk> could <unk> , that <unk> <unk> , <unk> this <unk> point of not <unk> .
In some <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> is already <unk> by the water .
The <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> ! <unk> : You 're good . The question is if you <unk> it .
A reason is that this <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> from the north .
This is a river in <unk> <unk> .
<unk> had never <unk> as a <unk> .
This is the <unk> river , in the <unk> of <unk> .
If you want to know how the <unk> level of the sea <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , here is where we <unk> the sea .
These <unk> are <unk> <unk> .
On the other part of the planet : <unk> , the greatest <unk> ice on the planet .
<unk> month , scientists have <unk> that the <unk> of ice is in <unk> , and that <unk> <unk> <unk> , which is <unk> on some <unk> <unk> , is particularly <unk> in <unk> .
<unk> at six feet of the <unk> , as <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , the <unk> third <unk> of ice , <unk> new <unk> , which few years ago were <unk> .
40 percent of the world population <unk> water from that <unk> .
<unk> <unk> : this <unk> is the source of water <unk> of this city .
<unk> is <unk> .
But when you <unk> , the same happens to the water .
In California , <unk> , <unk> <unk> is 40 percent .
The <unk> <unk> are in the crisis .
The <unk> , as you read , are <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> in the world <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> are <unk> to a <unk> out of normal and <unk> .
<unk> times more <unk> in the last 30 years of respect to the <unk> <unk> .
This is a <unk> of <unk> .
If you look at it in the context of the <unk> , if you can see the <unk> .
In the last five years we 've <unk> 70 million <unk> of CO2 every day -- 25 million <unk> in the oceans .
Look at the <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and on both parts of the <unk> <unk> , where there 's a <unk> <unk> of oxygen in the ocean .
The biggest cause of global warming , together with <unk> , which is 20 percent , is the use of <unk> <unk> .
The oil is a problem , and <unk> is even worse .
The United States is one of the two countries with <unk> emissions , together .
And they 're <unk> to build a lot of other <unk> <unk> .
But we 're <unk> to a <unk> of direction .
These are the <unk> projects in the last few years and some <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
And so , there 's a <unk> politics in our country .
The <unk> of <unk> and oil <unk> have <unk> <unk> million dollars in the last year to <unk> <unk> <unk> , which is a <unk> .
I 'm going to give something --
<unk> <unk> , where I live , there was a <unk> of <unk> billion <unk> .
Maybe you saw it on the <unk> .
This is the second largest flow of <unk> in America .
It 's been around <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> of one of the <unk> <unk> was this .
<unk> : <unk> ♫ ♫ <unk> the <unk> is a <unk> and happy guy .
It 's <unk> here in America , and it <unk> our economy .
<unk> the <unk> is <unk> <unk> .
It 's a good price , <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> : From here , this is a lot of <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The greatest <unk> society on the <unk> is <unk> <unk> . This is his <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> : <unk> <unk> -- Al <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> -- don 't know what they 're talking about .
<unk> : So the <unk> for the <unk> of the <unk> has <unk> two <unk> .
This is one of them , one part .
<unk> : <unk> : <unk> we see <unk> climate change as a <unk> <unk> to our business .
So , we have a great amount of money in a <unk> <unk> to <unk> and <unk> the truth on <unk> .
In fact , <unk> is not <unk> .
We think it 's <unk> -- it 's got a good <unk> .
So not <unk> of climate change .
We could do ourselves .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> -- you 've heard about this very much .
So we 're going to <unk> a <unk> <unk> in a <unk> , as <unk> .
<unk> ! The machines are a little <unk> , but this is the sound of the <unk> technology .
<unk> <unk> is between the major <unk> of global warming , but the <unk> technology <unk> that you see everything .
So , let 's look : this is the <unk> <unk> technology .
<unk> : <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to the economic issue and the national security .
<unk> : <unk> America is in the crisis ; the national security crisis ; the national security crisis .
The <unk> that the <unk> all : our <unk> <unk> <unk> , like <unk> <unk> and oil <unk> .
Now , there 's a new , <unk> solution to <unk> .
<unk> America : 100 percent of energy energy <unk> , in 10 years .
A plan to <unk> America at work , <unk> more <unk> , and help <unk> <unk> .
<unk> , a solution that we could solve our problems .
<unk> America . We 're going to talk more .
<unk> : This is the last one .
<unk> : <unk> : It 's about energy energy to America .
One of the most <unk> of the <unk> of the end of the <unk> that we <unk> our planet .
<unk> : The future is here . <unk> , <unk> , a new <unk> <unk> .
<unk> 2 : <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> America . It 's time to be <unk> .
<unk> : A old <unk> <unk> says , " If you want to go to , go alone .
If you want to go far , go together . "
We have to go far , quickly .
Thank you very much .
<unk> year I did a <unk> <unk> on <unk> .
And we 're going to try to <unk> about how the car works .
So here we go . And for those that time , there were no , the <unk> is the greatest <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
His task is to <unk> the conditions that were in the <unk> of the <unk> of the beginning of the universe -- until <unk> million times per second .
This is just <unk> .
This is the machine under <unk> .
We had these <unk> <unk> <unk> into the <unk> .
This is what I work on . It 's called <unk> <unk> , and it has a <unk> of <unk> feet .
This is a <unk> image of <unk> in building so you can see the <unk> .
The next 10 <unk> year we <unk> the machine for the first time .
And this picture was <unk> by <unk> .
It was <unk> <unk> in the control room .
It 's a picture of the first <unk> of particles that had done all the <unk> <unk> , <unk> , with a part of the <unk> , and <unk> particles inside the <unk> .
In other words , when I <unk> that image of the <unk> , you <unk> the <unk> machine , which is a great <unk> .
I don 't know if it was this to do <unk> <unk> or this , when somebody <unk> on Google and <unk> that the page was this .
That means that we had a <unk> impact on that scientific .
<unk> a week later , there was a problem with the machine , had to do these <unk> <unk> here -- these <unk> <unk> .
These <unk> <unk> <unk> when the car works at the <unk> of the <unk> .
Now , the <unk> of you <unk> the <unk> and <unk> , " It 's not true . I 'm <unk> too <unk> . "
And instead of they can do it because when they 're very <unk> <unk> <unk> .
So , at least <unk> degrees , at a temperature <unk> to the <unk> of space between stars , these <unk> can bring that <unk> .
In one of the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> in the <unk> , there was a <unk> <unk> .
So the <unk> <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a electric electric <unk> .
This was the result .
Now , this is even more <unk> if you think that these <unk> <unk> <unk> over 20 <unk> , and that 's <unk> about 30 <unk> .
They 're <unk> about 50 <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , what we did .
We <unk> them and <unk> .
They 're now <unk> all their <unk> place .
We 're going to <unk> the <unk> <unk> is going to be new <unk> .
We <unk> it , and we try to get data <unk> or <unk> , and so on our <unk> to discover what the <unk> are the universe .
Now , of course , in a way , these <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> of science and engineering engineering <unk> . It 's easy to <unk> .
I think the fact that it 's so hard , the fact of go beyond <unk> , I think it 's the value of things like <unk> .
I 'd like to end with the words of a <unk> <unk> , which , <unk> , in <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , his <unk> was <unk> , his <unk> was <unk> , he said , " It 's not so <unk> that the ideas of human mind as the <unk> as the <unk> that the ideas of human mind as the <unk> that our <unk> are <unk> , and there are not new <unk> . "
Thank you .
I want to start <unk> to when , as children , <unk> with <unk> .
As we were <unk> as <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> ,
The <unk> <unk> is <unk> <unk> to the way we <unk> most of the world around us .
So , from <unk> <unk> <unk> of our <unk> with <unk> objects , and my <unk> <unk> , and my <unk> <unk> <unk> , and my <unk> <unk> <unk> , I started <unk> : " And if we use a computer , instead of having the only <unk> of the <unk> as digital <unk> that <unk> on a <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> an information with both of the hands ,
and we start our <unk> ?
The question was so interesting to <unk> the answer , building the answer , building the <unk> .
In a few words , a <unk> is a <unk> computer as a <unk> .
In a few words , a <unk> is a <unk> computer as a <unk> .
You can <unk> them with your hand , can <unk> <unk> with their own , feel their <unk> movement and they have a screen and a <unk> radio .
But <unk> , they 're <unk> objects , like <unk> , you can just <unk> .
The <unk> are the example of a new <unk> tools to <unk> the digital information .
And as they become more <unk> , <unk> of the movement , <unk> of the other , and then as they become more <unk> , <unk> of the <unk> , the other , of how we can explore and <unk> <unk> .
Let 's just just just just just <unk> example .
This <unk> is <unk> to show up to video : if you <unk> it in a direction , the video <unk> so , if you go on the other side of the <unk> back .
These <unk> <unk> are <unk> of others .
If you <unk> them , you 're <unk> to what they are around .
If they 're <unk> , you can <unk> it and they can <unk> a little bit .
If they 're <unk> , you can <unk> it and they can <unk> a little bit .
They also have their movement and <unk> .
We 've <unk> that one of the interesting <unk> of the <unk> <unk> that could use <unk> <unk> on data , for example , <unk> <unk> , a color as if it was a <unk> .
In this case , we have three <unk> <unk> as a <unk> <unk> and I can <unk> it to <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> in the <unk> , where they <unk> .
and I can <unk> it to <unk> the <unk> of the color in the central one , where you 're <unk> .
If we too much , we can <unk> some of them , we can <unk> some of them .
I 'm also <unk> possibilities , like <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , where people can try things things , and <unk> the results that are <unk> the <unk> immediately .
Now I 'm --
This is a <unk> sequence I 'm doing with a <unk> program .
Here we have a <unk> of words that is in the middle of <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> , at any <unk> <unk> a letter in case , <unk> , <unk> , every <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , he <unk> on a <unk> .
And then , after about 30 seconds , you <unk> , and you have a new <unk> and new <unk> to try .
Thank you .
Here 's the <unk> kids in <unk> to the <unk> <unk> , I did this <unk> , and I <unk> them up and I <unk> a video .
They 're very <unk> .
And one of the interesting things of these kinds of <unk> is that you don 't have to give people a lot of <unk> .
I just mean , " <unk> of the words , " and they know exactly what to do .
Here 's other people who <unk> it .
This is our <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and a young <unk> , there on the right .
It was actually just <unk> .
It was only <unk> , for him .
Now , this is a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
We had to build a <unk> for the <unk> of the <unk> . He 's <unk> .
It can <unk> new characters in the scene , <unk> their <unk> .
It can <unk> new characters in the scene , <unk> their <unk> .
So here 's what you 're going to get out .
<unk> : The sun is <unk> .
David <unk> : Now he brought a <unk> in the scene .
<unk> : The <unk> <unk> .
<unk> ! Yeah ! <unk> !
So , <unk> <unk> and <unk> can get the characters <unk> --
<unk> : <unk> !
-- I 'm going to <unk> your story .
<unk> : <unk> !
<unk> : It 's a story with the open , and it can decide how to do it .
<unk> : It 's a story with the open , and it can decide how to do it .
<unk> : You 're going to get away , <unk> .
<unk> : The last example I have time I 've got time to show you this is a <unk> , <unk> and <unk> music .
It 's a recent <unk> , <unk> <unk> music .
The <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
And so , of these have four different <unk> , and you can choose what to use .
You can also <unk> these <unk> in a sequence of <unk> .
And we just <unk> a <unk> sound " and a <unk> sequence . "
These are effects that you can control live , like <unk> and <unk> .
I 'm going to <unk> the particular sound and then <unk> to <unk> .
And then there are the effects of time and <unk> , that <unk> to the entire sequence .
<unk> like it works .
<unk> : <unk> : <unk> <unk> a series of <unk> , " <unk> , " <unk> , " <unk> , " <unk> , " <unk> , " <unk> , " <unk> , " <unk> , " <unk> , " <unk> , " <unk> , " <unk> , " <unk> , "
Now , let 's take a <unk> line .
<unk> : <unk> : Now , I 'm going to <unk> <unk> --
<unk> : <unk> : And now I 'm going to <unk> the <unk> , so I can control the effect of the alive .
<unk> : <unk> : I can <unk> the entire sequence time on the side or the other .
<unk> : <unk> : And now we 're going to <unk> the <unk> to give more <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> : I can <unk> the <unk> of <unk> .
So I don 't have to go through before , but I can <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
And now , I can <unk> the entire <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is to build new <unk> <unk> <unk> and more <unk> to how our brain work and body .
And today , I 've had time to show you one of the results of this <unk> , and also some possibilities that we try to bring out of the lab .
The concept that I want to <unk> is that 's <unk> this new generation of objects that we want to <unk> with the media , that we want .
Thank you very much .
I don 't see the time to talk to you to all .
I 'm a <unk> .
<unk> books is my <unk> , but it 's more of this .
It 's also love and the <unk> of my life .
And I don 't like that I can change .
But , I said this , something particular happened in my life and my career , and in my career , who brought me to <unk> the whole relationship with this work .
The particular thing is that I wrote this book , this <unk> called " <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
And the result is that everywhere I 'm <unk> to <unk> , people like I was <unk> .
<unk> -- <unk> , <unk> !
<unk> me now , everybody <unk> and they say , " You don 't fear of you not be able to do better ?
You don 't fear of <unk> to write all of life that can be able to create a book that could <unk> to someone ? "
<unk> that can <unk> to somebody ? "
It 's <unk> , you know .
But it might go worse , <unk> that I remember , over 20 years ago , when I was saying to people -- I was a <unk> -- I wanted to be a <unk> .
I 'm going to <unk> the same <unk> as the <unk> .
And people say , " Don 't you know , you don 't know that to be successful ?
You don 't fear the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> ?
You don 't fear of doing this <unk> for all life without any <unk> ever ever out and die on a <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> ? "
So , you know .
The answer -- the short answer to all these questions is , " Yes . "
Yeah , I fear of all those things .
I 've always had fear .
And I fear of many other things that people don 't have to <unk> .
As <unk> and other things <unk> .
But , as I 'm going to write it to me and I thought , is why ?
Is it <unk> ?
It 's <unk> that anybody who <unk> <unk> to be <unk> by a job that you feel born .
But what is so particular in the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> about health <unk> <unk> <unk> in a way that other <unk> don 't do ?
As my father , for example , he was a <unk> <unk> and not <unk> of one time in his 40 years of <unk> in which he was asked if she was afraid he was asked ?
<unk> 't it -- that <unk> of the <unk> John , how do that ?
<unk> 't that way , <unk> ?
<unk> , the engineers <unk> as a group of certainly , in the <unk> , <unk> the <unk> of being <unk> <unk> .
We <unk> , we have enough this <unk> , and not only <unk> but <unk> of all sorts of these , we have this <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
And I 'm not going to look at the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> that , only in the <unk> century , <unk> young and often to do them .
And the ones that don 't have <unk> to be really <unk> by their <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , before I was dying , in the last <unk> said , " I was <unk> a little more , " A extraordinary <unk> about the work of his life .
But we didn 't know when we were <unk> to say , because we heard these things so long , in some way we have <unk> and <unk> the <unk> that creativity and <unk> are kind of <unk> and <unk> and the art , at the end , we <unk> to <unk> .
And the question I want to <unk> you to all here is : are all <unk> with this idea ?
It 's good this thing -- because I also <unk> from a <unk> distance to me to me , this <unk> .
I think it 's <unk> .
And I think it 's <unk> and I don 't want to <unk> in the next century .
I think we better <unk> our great <unk> <unk> to live .
And I certainly know , in my case -- in the situation -- it would be very <unk> to start <unk> to that <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> in which I 'm in my career .
<unk> -- I 'm <unk> to look , I 'm young , I 'm <unk> , I 'm quite young , I 'm <unk> , I 'm quite young , I 'm quite a <unk> .
I 've still got about four <unk> <unk> in me .
And it 's very <unk> that anything <unk> of now in the world as the work that we <unk> the world as the work that <unk> after the <unk> of my last book .
<unk> <unk> , because we 're all about <unk> <unk> , because we 're all <unk> my greatest success is to my greatest <unk> to be .
Oh , <unk> , <unk> , thinking !
You know this is the kind of thought that leads a person to start to <unk> <unk> at nine of the morning and I don 't want to do it .
I love to keep doing this work that I love .
So , the question becomes , how ?
And so I think , after many <unk> , that the way to work to keep <unk> and <unk> is to create a <unk> <unk> , OK ?
I have to have to come to some way to find a <unk> distance of me , and my <unk> <unk> on what <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . And as I was going to get <unk> the last year of how to do it , to look at the time , to try to find other society to see if we have of the best ideas and see if we have of the best ideas and <unk> to <unk> other society .
about how to help people <unk> <unk> <unk> of creativity .
And that research brought me to the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
We 're going to go back to <unk> and then <unk> back .
<unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> -- people don 't believe that creativity <unk> creativity , you know , OK ?
It was <unk> that creativity was this <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> to men from some <unk> <unk> and <unk> , for reasons and <unk> and <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> these <unk> <unk> of creativity " <unk> . "
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> to have a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> were the same idea , but we <unk> that kind of spirit without a <unk> .
And that 's <unk> , because the <unk> didn 't really <unk> that a <unk> was somebody particularly intelligent .
And I thought a <unk> was this kind of <unk> <unk> that <unk> literally in the <unk> of a artist , a little artist , a little <unk> , and <unk> out of <unk> <unk> the work of the artist and <unk> the result of that work .
<unk> <unk> , here is the distance of which I 'm talking -- that <unk> <unk> you from the results of your work .
And everybody <unk> that was so <unk> , right ?
So , the <unk> artists were <unk> by <unk> things , like the too <unk> , right ?
If your job was <unk> , you didn 't have to <unk> all the <unk> , all you could have been <unk> by this <unk> <unk> .
If your work <unk> , it wasn 't all <unk> your <unk> , right ?
And all you know that was your <unk> to be a <unk> .
And so people <unk> <unk> creativity <unk> creativity in <unk> for a long time .
And then the <unk> <unk> and all <unk> , and we <unk> this great idea ; we put the human human in the center of the universe and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and
This was the principle of <unk> <unk> and people started thinking that creativity <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And the first time in history , he <unk> to <unk> this or that artist as a <unk> <unk> that to a <unk> person with the <unk> .
And I have to <unk> , I think it was a big <unk> .
I think you 're going to somebody , a simple person to believe that I 'm like a source , the <unk> and the <unk> of all the <unk> <unk> , <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> is a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
It 's like to somebody to <unk> the sun .
<unk> and <unk> all of the <unk> and creates all these <unk> <unk> on the <unk> .
And I think it was this pressure to <unk> the artists in the <unk> 500 years .
And if that 's true , and I think that 's that the question is , the question is , and now ?
Can we do that ?
We could go back to a <unk> understanding of the relationship between humans and <unk> <unk> .
Or maybe not .
Maybe we can 't <unk> 500 years of thinking in a talk about 18 minutes .
And there 's probably people in the audience who <unk> <unk> <unk> on their <unk> , you do <unk> people <unk> <unk> on their projects .
You probably don 't <unk> all about this thing .
But the question I 'd like to <unk> is -- why ?
Why not we 're not going to <unk> this way ?
Because it makes more sense of anything that I 've ever heard about the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> process .
A process that , as anyone who ever <unk> to do something -- so , so , all of them -- you know , you don 't <unk> <unk> .
And in fact , it can sometimes seem to completely <unk> .
I did this <unk> <unk> with the extraordinary <unk> <unk> , who has now 90 years , but it was a <unk> for all life and he said that during his <unk> in the <unk> <unk> , <unk> out of the <unk> , <unk> out of the <unk> .
He said he was like a <unk> <unk> of the air .
And he <unk> <unk> to her from <unk> .
We had it to go , because he <unk> the land under his feet .
We decided to have one thing to do and that point and he was , " <unk> as a <unk> . "
And so he went to the house and he was <unk> by this <unk> , and he couldn 't get anything else that take a piece of paper and a <unk> enough <unk> , and <unk> and <unk> on the page .
<unk> times I didn 't go to be fast enough , so <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and she would <unk> the <unk> through and she would <unk> it up and she would <unk> to <unk> through the <unk> , to look for , to her , to her , to say , " another <unk> . "
Then there were those times -- this piece of never <unk> it -- there were moments in which was almost <unk> , OK ?
So , he was <unk> home and he was looking for the card and the <unk> through , and he was <unk> in the while he was <unk> , and he was <unk> , and he was like , and he was <unk> .
<unk> the <unk> from the tail and the <unk> in his body and the <unk> on the page .
And in these cases , the <unk> would be <unk> on the page and <unk> but <unk> , by the last word at the first word .
So when you <unk> -- it 's <unk> , it 's <unk> , it 's <unk> to my <unk> process .
Not my <unk> process -- I 'm not a <unk> !
I 'm a <unk> , and my way to <unk> is ; I 'm <unk> every day and work and work and <unk> over .
But even I , in my <unk> , I <unk> against that thing , sometimes .
And I 'm sure many of you <unk> the <unk> .
You know , even if the work and ideas <unk> me from a certain source , I couldn 't <unk> <unk> .
And what is this thing ?
And how can we <unk> it in it <unk> way we don 't have your head , but , rather , that <unk> <unk> <unk> ?
So as I 'm <unk> , the best example I have is the <unk> <unk> <unk> , which I <unk> <unk> years ago for a <unk> .
And I was talking about this , and you know , <unk> , for the <unk> of life was the <unk> of the <unk> artist <unk> , <unk> , <unk> these <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
But then he was <unk> , and one day while he was <unk> on a <unk> <unk> <unk> , he <unk> it all for him .
It 's going fast and all of a <unk> <unk> this little <unk> of <unk> , that 's in his head as the <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , and you know , it 's wonderful , and the <unk> , you know , it 's wonderful , and the <unk> , but he doesn 't know how to <unk> .
It doesn 't have a piece of paper , it doesn 't have a <unk> .
So he starts to hear this <unk> species of old <unk> grow in him , " I 'm going to lose , and <unk> <unk> by this song .
I 'm not <unk> enough , I can 't <unk> . "
And instead of going to <unk> , <unk> .
<unk> the whole <unk> process and he did something completely new .
I just <unk> the sky and he said , " <unk> , don 't you see I 'm <unk> ? "
" <unk> <unk> that can write a song now ?
If you really want to <unk> , you 're going to <unk> a <unk> moment when I can take care of you .
<unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
We 're going to <unk> <unk> <unk> . "
And his <unk> process after this .
Not the work , the work was still <unk> as always .
But the process , and the <unk> <unk> that <unk> was <unk> when he <unk> , the <unk> that out of he <unk> , he <unk> that out of he <unk> the <unk> that he was not to be a thing and <unk> .
but I was <unk> this <unk> , wonderful <unk> <unk> a conversation between <unk> and this <unk> thing and <unk> and <unk> , but it wasn 't <unk> .
So , how much I <unk> that story to change a little bit of the way I 'm going to <unk> once .
This idea , I was <unk> when I was <unk> " <unk> , " and I was <unk> , " and I went to one of the <unk> in which we 're all working on something and you can think it 's going to be a <unk> , that what 's going to be the book .
Not just <unk> , just the <unk> book wrote .
And we start thinking about <unk> this project .
But then I 'm going to try to <unk> that <unk> to <unk> into the air and <unk> .
So I <unk> my face on the <unk> and I <unk> my <unk> to a <unk> <unk> <unk> of the room .
And I said to <unk> , " <unk> , what , we know that if this book is not going to be <unk> , I don 't <unk> <unk> , I don 't ?
Because as you see I 'm <unk> everything I have , I have no more of this .
So if you want it better , you have to <unk> and do your part .
OK . But if you don 't do that , you know what , I don 't <unk> .
I started writing the same because it 's my job .
And I 'd like you to <unk> that I 'm <unk> to do my part of " Because , " Because it 's so , OK -- <unk> <unk> is in the <unk> of Africa <unk> the North <unk> people <unk> to <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> of the moon , <unk> music that <unk> hours to <unk> .
And they were always <unk> , because the <unk> were <unk> and they were <unk> .
But every long , I <unk> , something <unk> , and one of these <unk> artists actually <unk> .
And I know you know what I 'm talking about , because I know you 've all seen this <unk> , at some point , a <unk> like this .
It was like the time , and the <unk> <unk> through a kind of <unk> and he didn 't do anything different from the usually , but everything else , and it <unk> .
And suddenly , you don 't just like a human .
But it <unk> up and <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk> .
And when this <unk> , at the time , people <unk> what was , he <unk> her name .
<unk> your hands and <unk> to <unk> , " <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , God , God , " God , " God . "
That 's God , you know .
<unk> note -- when the <unk> <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> , we <unk> this <unk> with them and the <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> , " <unk> , " <unk> , " <unk> , " <unk> , " which you can still feel in the <unk> or in the <unk> .
In <unk> , when a artist did something impossible and <unk> , " <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , " <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , " <unk> , <unk> -- a <unk> of God .
And it 's <unk> because we need it .
But , the problem comes after day , for the <unk> itself , when you <unk> and <unk> that are 11 <unk> of <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> . God is <unk> <unk> .
It 's just a <unk> <unk> with a lot of <unk> , and maybe never <unk> to that <unk> .
And maybe nobody <unk> the name of God still <unk> , and so he must do with his life ?
It 's hard .
This is one of the most <unk> <unk> to do in a <unk> life .
But maybe it doesn 't have to be so <unk> if you can 't believe , you 're not going to <unk> , you know , that the most <unk> of your being being <unk> .
But let 's just just <unk> that you 're data in <unk> from a <unk> source of this <unk> part of your life that you then have to go to <unk> something else when you 're finished .
And , you know , if we think it all changes .
And so I started <unk> , and it 's <unk> like I <unk> it for several months during the <unk> of the book that I was <unk> , the <unk> , <unk> of my <unk> .
And what I have to go on <unk> when I feel <unk> from this is , I don 't fear .
Don 't you just get your job .
You 're going to <unk> for your side , whatever it can be .
If your work is <unk> , you <unk> .
If the <unk> , you 're going to <unk> you would <unk> to <unk> some kind of <unk> , for only moment through your <unk> , then you go ! "
<unk> , you do the same your <unk> .
And " <unk> ! " <unk> ! " You 're going to be the same .
I think we have to do this and I think it 's <unk> .
" <unk> ! " <unk> ! " <unk> ! "
Thank you .
Thank you .
<unk> <unk> : <unk> !
As you know , I 've been talking about some of these projects on the human genome , what can <unk> and discovery of new genes .
We 're now <unk> a new path . We started <unk> biology and now starting from that digital code , we 're <unk> into a new <unk> of biology , <unk> and <unk> life .
We always tried to ask great questions .
" <unk> is life ? " It 's something that many <unk> , I think they have <unk> to understand at different levels .
We tried different <unk> , <unk> to <unk> terms of <unk> .
We 're <unk> for about 20 years now .
When we <unk> the human genome <unk> to go from the <unk> world of biology to the world 's digital biology .
Now we 're going to <unk> : can we <unk> life , or create new life from this digital universe ?
This is the map of a little <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , which is the species from the <unk> genome of the <unk> genome between the <unk> that can <unk> into the lab .
And we tried to reduce <unk> the genome to <unk> a much smaller .
We can <unk> a <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of 500 genes that are here .
But when we take a look at his <unk> map , it 's very simple than our .
<unk> , this is simple .
But when we look at all the genes that we can <unk> , one at the time , is very <unk> that this can bring to a <unk> cell .
So , I thought the only way to <unk> was <unk> this <unk> <unk> by <unk> some of these questions .
So we started the <unk> of " We can <unk> a <unk> ? "
Can the chemistry to produce these big molecules that we never <unk> before we 've never been able to create before ?
And , in case , can we make a <unk> ?
A <unk> is just a piece of <unk> <unk> material .
The speed we 're able to <unk> life is <unk> to <unk> <unk> .
Our <unk> of writing the <unk> , instead of slowly , but it 's <unk> .
And our most <unk> results of the <unk> <unk> .
We spent more than 15 years ago .
The process has a lot of <unk> , <unk> with a <unk> <unk> before we <unk> the early experiments .
But we found that we <unk> of DNA <unk> is very hard .
There are <unk> of thousands of cars in the world that we have small <unk> of DNA , of the <unk> of 30 to 50 <unk> and it 's a <unk> process .
So we had to develop a new <unk> to <unk> these <unk> and <unk> .
And this was our first <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
It 's a little virus that <unk> bacteria .
We designed the <unk> , <unk> the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> a DNA <unk> of about <unk> <unk> .
The interesting part is when we took this piece of <unk> <unk> <unk> and we <unk> it in bacteria , the bacteria have <unk> to read this code and <unk> particles .
The <unk> particles have been <unk> by the cells , are <unk> back and <unk> <unk> .
I 've been talking about recently with members of the <unk> <unk> <unk> that they have certainly <unk> this model .
They have <unk> more than you .
And we think this is a situation where software can actually build his own <unk> in a <unk> system .
But we could do the greatest things in the big .
We had to build the whole <unk> of <unk> .
I 'm more than <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
So we thought we 're going to <unk> the size of the virus , so that we can change the <unk> to understand what the <unk> of a <unk> cell .
The <unk> is <unk> , and if you can <unk> information in a computer , these must be very <unk> .
When we <unk> this genome for the first time in <unk> the <unk> <unk> was of a <unk> for every 10 <unk> <unk> .
We found , <unk> , 30 <unk> . If you were able to do that <unk> <unk> , we never had to do it work .
One part of the process is to design <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> with all other <unk> <unk> of 50 <unk> to build smaller <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
We 're going to be <unk> here .
You probably read that <unk> <unk> .
So we 're going to have a <unk> code of four <unk> : A , <unk> , <unk> and <unk>
<unk> those <unk> <unk> <unk> together about 20 <unk> , and there 's a <unk> order of <unk> for every <unk> .
So we can use the code for <unk> words , <unk> , <unk> .
What we did at first was <unk> .
Some of them were <unk> by the fact that it wasn 't <unk> .
We designed these <unk> to just <unk> <unk> with <unk> .
There are <unk> <unk> them and <unk> them .
And we started <unk> parts , <unk> with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
We made these <unk> <unk> in <unk> so that we 've been <unk> <unk> , because we 're <unk> , and we 're going to create a very <unk> <unk> as you 'll see in a minute .
We 're trying to <unk> the process .
So this looks like the <unk> of a <unk> <unk> .
When we started these <unk> <unk> <unk> , more than 100 <unk> <unk> , you 're not going to be <unk> <unk> .
You get to the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> of biology .
So we 've <unk> other <unk> .
And so , as a <unk> called <unk> <unk> , which is in biology <unk> to <unk> DNA <unk> .
Here 's an example .
This <unk> , called <unk> <unk> , can <unk> three million <unk> <unk> .
You can see in the <unk> <unk> as his <unk> is <unk> .
In 12 hours -- it 's been <unk> exactly as it was before .
<unk> thousands of organisms that are able to do that .
These organisms can be completely <unk> .
We had to live under <unk> .
I 'm absolutely sure that life <unk> in space , and they <unk> to find new <unk> of water .
In fact , NASA <unk> showed that this happens .
This is a picture of the <unk> that we built these <unk> , just using these <unk> , just using the <unk> with the <unk> <unk> design .
The <unk> <unk> <unk> .
This picture was not <unk> with a <unk> <unk> , but with a <unk> <unk> .
It 's such a <unk> that we can <unk> with a <unk> <unk> .
These are pictures that <unk> a period of about six seconds .
This is the <unk> we 've done a little time ago .
I 'm more than <unk> <unk> code .
It 's the greatest <unk> of a <unk> <unk> <unk> ever <unk> by man .
It has a <unk> <unk> weight to 300 million .
If you put it with a 10 <unk> without spaces , we would only <unk> pages to <unk> this <unk> code .
Now , how do we make it work ? How can we <unk> ?
<unk> , by a virus is a game game .
It 's a little bit more <unk> when you use of the bacteria .
It 's easier even when it comes to the <unk> cells like our : you just <unk> the <unk> and <unk> another , which is basically the process of <unk> .
In <unk> , the <unk> is <unk> in the <unk> , but we <unk> <unk> that we are able to make a <unk> <unk> of a cell <unk> from a cell to another cell <unk> .
We <unk> a <unk> <unk> by a <unk> species .
The two different than men are <unk> .
We <unk> some <unk> <unk> in a way that we could decide what to do to do to <unk> this <unk> .
And he <unk> it with the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And when we put it in the cell was <unk> and we <unk> our <unk> <unk> the new <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> into the cell .
And we had to <unk> that we didn 't go beyond , but we tried to <unk> more <unk> in there .
This is one of the major <unk> of evolution .
We found that <unk> species have <unk> a second or a third <unk> somewhere , <unk> in a second thousands of new <unk> to that species .
So , who thinks of evolution as a only <unk> at the time you <unk> didn 't understand a lot of biology .
We 're going to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> that was in the cell didn 't <unk> one .
The <unk> <unk> we <unk> it .
It 's <unk> , and he <unk> the other <unk> as <unk> , he <unk> it , and we <unk> it with only cell and the new <unk> .
It 's become blue because of the genes we <unk> .
And in a short <unk> of time , all of the <unk> of a species are <unk> , and it <unk> of all over in a new species , <unk> on the new software that we <unk> in the cell .
All the <unk> are <unk> , the <unk> are <unk> , and when we <unk> the code that we <unk> exactly what we <unk> you <unk> .
Now , this may seem <unk> <unk> , but we can <unk> the software , we can change things in a <unk> way .
Now , I 've already <unk> that you 're not talking about <unk> -- but of progress , from three million years and a half of evolution , and I 've already said that maybe we 're going to create a new version of <unk> <unk> in which we 're going to create new <unk> <unk> about <unk> new species on this process .
Why do that ?
I think it 's pretty <unk> when we think about our <unk> .
We 're going to go from six billion people to <unk> billion in the next 40 years .
Just to give an example : I was born in <unk> .
Now there are three people on the planet to <unk> in the <unk> ; in 40 years , there will be four .
We 're <unk> problems now to find food , water and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> for six billion people .
We 're going to get to do it for nine billion .
We 're more than five billion <unk> , over 30 billion <unk> .
That means 100 million <unk> a day .
When we try to find <unk> <unk> , or any kind of <unk> process to <unk> , it will be a huge challenge .
In more we have to realize that all of CO2 <unk> from these materials that <unk> in the atmosphere .
So , in fact , because of the <unk> <unk> around the world , we have a <unk> with about 20 million genes , and I love to think that are the <unk> <unk> for the future .
The <unk> industry only a <unk> about <unk> , and you think about how many different things are <unk> out .
Our <unk> here are <unk> data from reality , and our imagination .
We now have <unk> , because of these <unk> <unk> <unk> , able to create what we call the <unk> <unk> .
We can make a big robot that can produce a million <unk> per day .
Think of <unk> these 20 million different genes or try to <unk> the <unk> to make <unk> or <unk> , new <unk> , we can change , because of a little team , and create more biology <unk> that in the last 20 years of science .
And it 's just a standard <unk> .
We can choose to <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
This is a <unk> of some software <unk> that we 're working on to be able to <unk> and design species to computers .
Well , we don 't know how they will be .
We know exactly what their <unk> code .
We 're <unk> on the <unk> of <unk> generation .
You also saw that <unk> <unk> from <unk> was a <unk> experiment .
We <unk> second and third generation that we had to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> as the <unk> <unk> or different kinds of <unk> .
But the only way that biology can have a big impact without <unk> the cost of food and <unk> the <unk> would be <unk> the CO2 and <unk> would be <unk> the CO2 in about about 18 months .
The solar light <unk> with CO2 is a <unk> , but in our <unk> <unk> around the world , we found different <unk> .
This is a <unk> we <unk> in <unk> .
We <unk> in the deep ocean , at about <unk> feet of <unk> .
We 're <unk> by CO2 using hydrogen <unk> as hydrogen .
We 're trying to understand whether we can <unk> CO2 , that can easily be <unk> through <unk> , <unk> that CO2 in <unk> , to drive this process .
So we short think we can think we could be able to <unk> what the basic question , " What is life . " We , we <unk> the <unk> goal of <unk> the entire industry .
<unk> . If you can 't do this from TED , where can you ?
We had a major source of energy .
And we 're working on using the same <unk> to create <unk> <unk> .
You saw this year with flu , we 're always <unk> back a year and with a dollar in less when it 's about finding the right <unk> .
I think what you can change building <unk> <unk> in <unk> .
Here 's how the future could start to look <unk> , now , the tree of evolution , <unk> bacteria with bacteria , <unk> , and finally <unk> cells .
We 're in so much of the <unk> people .
Our goal is to make a long enough to <unk> <unk> . Thank you very long enough .
So , first of all I 'm going to show you , the <unk> possible , some fundamental work , of the new technology we brought to <unk> <unk> to a <unk> almost a year ago . This is <unk> .
It 's a environment in which you can <unk> it up on the local level that you can <unk> with a huge amount of data .
We 're seeing <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> with a kind of <unk> <unk> and <unk> , for a fast <unk> , <unk> images as we want .
And it doesn 't matter how big the amount of information that we see , how big it are these <unk> of data or images .
Most of them are common photographs , but this is a <unk> <unk> by the <unk> of the <unk> , and <unk> in the <unk> of 300 <unk> .
It doesn 't make any difference because the only thing that <unk> the <unk> of a system like this is the number of <unk> on your screen at any time . It 's also a very <unk> architecture .
This is a whole book , example of data not images .
This is the <unk> <unk> <unk> . Every <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
So to <unk> that it 's about <unk> and not about images , we can do something like that , to really see that it 's a real <unk> of the text , not a picture .
It could be a little <unk> way to read a little book .
I don 't <unk> you .
This is a more <unk> example . It 's a number of The <unk> .
And every big image is the beginning of a <unk> .
And it really gives you the pleasure and the beautiful experience of <unk> or <unk> , which is for nature a <unk> , or a <unk> , which is nature a <unk> <unk> .
We also did something with the corner of this particular number of The <unk> .
We created a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> much more than what you use in a normal <unk> <unk> and we <unk> you <unk> of the <unk> content .
If you want to see the <unk> of this <unk> , you can see it here .
Or other models , or even <unk> <unk> .
And this really <unk> some of these ideas to <unk> the <unk> of space on the screen .
We thought this <unk> to put into the <unk> and other <unk> , not to be <unk> .
Of course , the <unk> is one of the most <unk> <unk> for this kind of technology .
And on this , I don 't want to lose time , if we don 't say that we have <unk> <unk> to <unk> this field .
These are all the streets in the United States <unk> over a <unk> image of NASA .
So now we 're going to <unk> something else .
This is actually actually in the Web , I can see you can see it .
It 's a project called <unk> , which <unk> two different technologies .
One is <unk> and the other is a <unk> research that was very interesting that made by <unk> <unk> , a student of <unk> , with the <unk> <unk> of <unk> and <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
And it 's alive on the Web , <unk> <unk> .
You can see when we do this kind of <unk> , where we can go from an image to another and have this kind of experience <unk> .
But the <unk> <unk> of the images here actually actually have a meaning .
The <unk> <unk> of the computer <unk> <unk> these pictures together , so that we could <unk> to the <unk> places that are <unk> <unk> <unk> . They 're <unk> on the <unk> <unk> are <unk> . And so you see some <unk> <unk> , and these things are all <unk> <unk> .
I don 't know if I have time to show you some other environment .
There are a few more <unk> .
I want to go directly to one of the <unk> of data <unk> and this <unk> <unk> <unk> that we 've done for the first time , we <unk> this this is the <unk> <unk> . And it 's not <unk> <unk> . And it 's not <unk> <unk> . And it 's not <unk> <unk> by looking for the <unk> we have in the website .
We had to <unk> some <unk> and so forth .
This is a <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> pictures of <unk> and <unk> and <unk> pictures of <unk> and so forth . And he 's going to <unk> of these <unk> <unk> <unk> a picture .
So they 're all <unk> images from <unk> and they 're all <unk> <unk> in this way .
And it 's possible to <unk> this <unk> way .
You know , I would never thought to work on <unk> .
It 's very <unk> <unk> <unk> this kind of <unk> here .
I think we 're going to see that it 's a lot of different types of <unk> : from the cell cell phones , a <unk> number , <unk> <unk> in this environment .
And if I can , I can , I 'll try and <unk> the <unk> .
Many are <unk> by <unk> , etc .
There 's a series of photographs -- <unk> .
This is a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
We can go from the physics of this environment .
The <unk> point is that we can do things with social environment . This is <unk> <unk> data from the whole memory of how we <unk> the earth , from the <unk> point of view and <unk> all that data together .
All of those pictures become <unk> together , more than the <unk> parts .
You have a model of the entire <unk> that <unk> .
Think about this as the <unk> of the work of <unk> <unk> on Earth .
It 's something that you <unk> in complexity as people who <unk> it , and the <unk> that you 're going to <unk> it with the use .
Their pictures are <unk> with other people .
If somebody comes the idea of <unk> all these <unk> <unk> <unk> , my name , my picture of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of all that data , and I can use it as a <unk> <unk> in that space , in that <unk> , using the pictures of anyone , and have a social experience .
Of course , a <unk> of all this is <unk> <unk> <unk> of every interesting part of the land , <unk> , not just <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> .
Thank you very much .
CA : I understand ? What 's the software to understand ? What 's your software <unk> us to do is that at some point , all the photographs <unk> that in the entire world <unk> , are we all <unk> from anybody in the entire world <unk> <unk> ?
<unk> : Yeah . What 's doing in fact , it 's <unk> .
It 's creating <unk> , if you want , between pictures .
And he 's <unk> it in the content of the images .
The thing becomes very interesting if you think about the <unk> of information that a lot of these <unk> <unk> .
As you do a <unk> <unk> , you <unk> a <unk> and the text on the page , you <unk> a <unk> and the text on the page has a lot of information about images .
Now , what happens if that picture is going on if that picture is that picture ?
So the amount of <unk> <unk> and the amount of <unk> that <unk> is really enormous . It 's a <unk> effect .
CA : <unk> , it 's really incredible . <unk> .
<unk> : I 'm going to give you a lot .
One of the major <unk> when you <unk> and one of the <unk> research is the could live between who didn 't <unk> the <unk> <unk> , <unk> the past , the <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> of plants .
We think that the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , or that the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> are still <unk> <unk> <unk> , or <unk> , the <unk> <unk> still the <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> , and that the idea that the world in which we live in which , but it 's only a <unk> of reality , but it 's a <unk> of reality , but it 's not in a <unk> sense , but it ,
the <unk> of a particular <unk> of <unk> choices that our <unk> <unk> has done , or bad , many <unk> .
And , of course , we all <unk> of the <unk> <unk> .
Everybody <unk> . <unk> .
We 're <unk> to <unk> <unk> .
We have to deal with the <unk> of death , so we don 't <unk> and <unk> --
We all have a art .
What <unk> is the particular <unk> of the song , the <unk> of every culture .
It doesn 't matter that matter the <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> , or the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , or the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , or a <unk> in the heart of the <unk> , or a <unk> in the heart of the <unk> .
He was my <unk> <unk> in the <unk> a month ago , or a <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of <unk> , the <unk> mother of the world .
All of these <unk> <unk> that there are other ways of <unk> other ways of thinking , other ways of moving around the world .
And if you take a second , it 's a concept that can give you hope .
<unk> , the <unk> of the world create a <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> that <unk> the planet and it 's important for the <unk> of the planet as the <unk> <unk> <unk> as <unk> .
And you can think of this <unk> <unk> as a <unk> and you can <unk> the total <unk> of all the <unk> , dreams , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> in being by human imagination .
<unk> is the fantastic <unk> of humanity .
It 's the <unk> of what we are and what we can be as as <unk> species .
And <unk> the <unk> has been <unk> <unk> to <unk> and <unk> much faster .
<unk> <unk> , for example , <unk> that 50 percent of all species has been or is on the <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> , just because it 's <unk> , or -- in the <unk> , in the <unk> , in the field of diversity .
The <unk> of this is , of course , the <unk> <unk> .
When you 're <unk> <unk> <unk> on this planet .
A language is not only <unk> by a <unk> or a series of <unk> rules .
A language is the <unk> of the human spirit .
It 's the middle with which the <unk> of every culture comes into the world .
Every language is a forest of the mind , a <unk> , a thought , a <unk> of <unk> .
And of those <unk> <unk> , while we 're sitting here in <unk> , at least half is no longer <unk> in the <unk> of children .
They 're not going to be <unk> to children , which means , unless you know something , that they 're already death .
What is more <unk> than the <unk> , of being <unk> by the <unk> , of being the last to talk about a language , of not <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> or <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> or <unk> ?
This <unk> <unk> was the state of somebody in the world every two weeks , every two weeks , a <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> with the <unk> of a <unk> language .
And I know some of you <unk> " <unk> 't it better ?
The world would not be a better place if we all have the same language ? " <unk> , then we 're all <unk> .
<unk> <unk> .
We 're going to <unk> what it means not to be able to talk about your language .
I 'd like to give you a journey through the <unk> --
a little journey in the <unk> to give you a <unk> of what we 're <unk> .
A lot of us <unk> that when I say " different ways of <unk> . " I mean , " I really mean different ways of <unk> .
So , for example this <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> from the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
It 's a <unk> that 's not able to <unk> the blue color from the green because the <unk> <unk> is <unk> in the <unk> time of the forest , which we <unk> the <unk> .
They have a <unk> language and a <unk> rule , " <unk> " : you have to <unk> a different language .
This has <unk> in the past <unk> , but the <unk> is that in these <unk> families where you 're talking six or seven <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
You start listening and then you start to talk .
And I had one of the most interesting <unk> I 've lived , the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , an incredible <unk> that had the first <unk> in <unk> .
In <unk> , I had <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
They <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> that this <unk> of the <unk> <unk> had never seen anything <unk> .
They <unk> the pictures of the earth , they <unk> them to research a form or a <unk> and , not <unk> anything , have <unk> <unk> <unk> , and they <unk> the five <unk> with <unk> .
But the <unk> not only <unk> the <unk> .
They <unk> them .
<unk> percent of the <unk> of <unk> was <unk> by themselves .
We 're <unk> eight <unk> and we found two <unk> <unk> , and we found two natural death and when we <unk> to know , they <unk> that one of them was <unk> so that he died , and then they <unk> it .
The <unk> were able to recognize the animal <unk> from 40 <unk> and to <unk> the species .
<unk> <unk> , I was <unk> a really interesting job when my <unk> <unk> <unk> me if I wanted to go to <unk> <unk> , if I wanted to go to <unk> between the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And to make sense of the <unk> , I should have to understand culture and that <unk> is not <unk> <unk> .
It 's quite a <unk> <unk> vision of the world .
<unk> interesting .
If you tell you about <unk> the great <unk> of the world , what would you like ?
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , etc .
A continent comes out of thinking , thinking , <unk> Africa doesn 't <unk> <unk> <unk> . And instead and so that <unk> is not the <unk> of these <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> during the <unk> <unk> .
What makes the <unk> of <unk> is the <unk> of life and death .
So , the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> can be <unk> by the <unk> <unk> , <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> and <unk> <unk> to the <unk> in the <unk> in the way that for a second <unk> is the <unk> .
So , for the <unk> <unk> , " <unk> go to <unk> <unk> to talk about God .
We 're going to <unk> and <unk> God . "
And from the moment that you 're <unk> , is the spirit that <unk> you can <unk> you <unk> ?
So , you 're <unk> to these incredible events : <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a rather strong <unk> of the power of the mind , when it 's <unk> in a state of <unk> <unk> .
I 'm <unk> all the <unk> with which I 've lived the most <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , in the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> on the <unk> <unk> .
In a <unk> continent , this <unk> has never been <unk> by <unk> .
In <unk> , I 'm <unk> by a <unk> , but their education is <unk> <unk> .
The young <unk> are <unk> by <unk> <unk> for 18 years , and they live in a world <unk> <unk> and <unk> in <unk> <unk> <unk> for 18 years .
Two <unk> <unk> years <unk> of nine years <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> .
For all this time , they 're <unk> to the values of their society , values that they <unk> and only their <unk> <unk> <unk> -- or to say the <unk> <unk> .
And then this incredible <unk> , they 're <unk> <unk> out and for the first time in their life , at the age of 18 , see a <unk> . And in that moment of <unk> of the first <unk> , when the sun <unk> <unk> , all that they learned in theory in the <unk> . The <unk> <unk> is <unk> in his <unk> . The <unk> is <unk> in the <unk> .
" <unk> ? I 'm going to show you how I said .
It 's <unk> . Now he 's <unk> to you <unk> . "
It 's in the <unk> and they say that we , <unk> <unk> , we are the <unk> of the world 's <unk> .
This level of <unk> is extremely important .
When we think about the <unk> <unk> and the <unk> <unk> environment and the old history of the <unk> <unk> , which is a <unk> in the <unk> or maybe <unk> <unk> and say that these <unk> are more than we .
The <unk> <unk> are not <unk> or <unk> by <unk> .
There 's no space for these things in the <unk> <unk> of <unk> or in the <unk> <unk> of <unk> , but because of time and <unk> , have created a <unk> of the Earth 's not about <unk> <unk> <unk> , but on a <unk> <unk> -- the concept that the Earth can live only because it 's <unk> by the human consciousness .
What does that mean ?
I mean that a <unk> of the <unk> <unk> that the mountain is a spirit spirit that <unk> its <unk> will be <unk> a <unk> and it 's going to be <unk> different with the mountain or that place as a <unk> <unk> that <unk> a mountain of <unk> that <unk> <unk> a mountain <unk> that <unk> a mountain of <unk> <unk> to be <unk> .
which is the <unk> of a spirit or a <unk> <unk> is <unk> .
What 's interesting is the <unk> that <unk> the relationship between the <unk> and the natural world .
I grew up in the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> that the <unk> <unk> to be <unk> .
And that made me a human being different from my <unk> friends who believe that <unk> are the <unk> of <unk> and the <unk> <unk> <unk> and the <unk> <unk> that live in the <unk> <unk> of the world , <unk> that live in the <unk> <unk> .
If we were <unk> that these <unk> can actually create different , we could actually start to understand some of the <unk> .
I <unk> this picture of <unk> in <unk> <unk> .
Maybe some of you heard about the <unk> , the most powerful <unk> of the <unk> <unk> .
What makes the <unk> is not the potential of the <unk> , but his <unk> . It 's <unk> by two elements .
On one side , this <unk> <unk> <unk> a series of <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
<unk> the only <unk> <unk> a little <unk> <unk> that <unk> a little <unk> , but it 's <unk> with the <unk> of a <unk> family of the <unk> said <unk> .
This <unk> <unk> <unk> , very similar to the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
If you never see the <unk> <unk> <unk> on the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> that are <unk> <unk> .
<unk> that <unk> on the <unk> is a little bit of as being <unk> by a <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> on a sea of electricity . It doesn 't create a <unk> of reality ; it doesn 't create the <unk> of reality .
I often <unk> with my <unk> , Richard <unk> <unk> , the man who <unk> the <unk> was <unk> , with his discovery of <unk> <unk> in the <unk> .
My <unk> is not <unk> these <unk> as <unk> as a <unk> <unk> because if you 're not <unk> to be <unk> . <unk> 't you have to be <unk> because they 're <unk> by a <unk> that is , you know , you know , you can 't have <unk> because they 're <unk> by a <unk> <unk> .
It 's possible to <unk> only if you could <unk> <unk> with other <unk> <unk> that <unk> .
Now , the <unk> is the <unk> that are in this <unk> <unk> are <unk> <unk> , of the same necessary to <unk> the <unk> . The question <unk> question is , in a <unk> of <unk> species , how do these <unk> <unk> <unk> , and they make these <unk> <unk> two <unk> not similar , but that if you <unk> in this way , they create a <unk> version that 's <unk> ?
We use the great <unk> of <unk> and <unk> , which can <unk> <unk> .
But if we were to <unk> , we 'll be " The plants are talking . "
What does that mean ?
This <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> in the forest , and our eyes <unk> in the forest , and our eyes <unk> in the same species .
If you <unk> the <unk> <unk> , " <unk> <unk> , " <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , " I said , " No , " I said , " No . "
The solution is : you take the <unk> <unk> in a night , <unk> <unk> with a different <unk> .
And you don 't get <unk> , but it 's much more interesting than <unk> <unk> .
Now , [ <unk> ] the problem is that even those of us who have <unk> <unk> them , but in a way to the <unk> of the history of our real world , and <unk> .
In fact , the <unk> century , in 300 years , not <unk> <unk> for his <unk> or <unk> <unk> , but rather as the was where we <unk> and we <unk> and <unk> or <unk> <unk> the mass <unk> of the <unk> diversity and <unk> <unk> on the planet . Now the problem isn 't the change .
All <unk> through the <unk> have been <unk> in a <unk> for new possibilities .
And the problem is not technology .
<unk> <unk> have no <unk> to be <unk> when they put <unk> <unk> and <unk> as the <unk> <unk> of being <unk> when they put up <unk> and <unk> .
It 's not the change or technology that <unk> the <unk> of <unk> . It 's power .
The <unk> <unk> of <unk> .
And if you look at the world , you 'll see that these are not <unk> <unk> to <unk> .
They are <unk> creatures and <unk> <unk> out of the <unk> forces that go beyond their <unk> capacity .
<unk> that <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk> --
a <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> , a <unk> that <unk> <unk> in the forest to a generation of <unk> , and now <unk> on the <unk> of the <unk> , where you can see the <unk> <unk> from the <unk> , where you can see the <unk> <unk> from the <unk> <unk> , where the <unk> <unk> <unk> , where the <unk> <unk> <unk> , where the <unk> <unk> <unk> , where the <unk> <unk> <unk> ,
We 're going to <unk> the <unk> with the <unk> <unk> to the forest .
Or , in the case of the <unk> , are the disease that are <unk> with the discovery of <unk> .
If you put on the <unk> of the <unk> , where I 'm doing <unk> , you 'll see the <unk> <unk> of politics .
As a <unk> , <unk> physics of a <unk> , is <unk> <unk> , but <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , but <unk> , in certain <unk> , not only is <unk> , but <unk> in certain <unk> , because it 's part of development .
And you can 't understand the <unk> of the <unk> until you start .
I <unk> the <unk> miles from <unk> in the <unk> China through the <unk> <unk> , <unk> to <unk> with a young <unk> , but only <unk> <unk> , I realized what 's behind the <unk> that you can talk about .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> million people <unk> from the <unk> during the <unk> <unk> .
The father of this guy was <unk> to the <unk> <unk> .
which means that it was <unk> to be <unk> in the <unk> of Chinese .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
My mother was <unk> and his <unk> was <unk> .
It was taken of <unk> in <unk> at age of two <unk> years <unk> his <unk> because he couldn 't have to live without him .
The <unk> , who did the same , was <unk> in the <unk> .
One day he <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> and , for this <unk> , was <unk> to the work for seven years .
The pain of <unk> can be <unk> , but the spirit of the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> .
And then , all you <unk> to a choice .
We 're going to live in the <unk> world of diversity or <unk> <unk> ?
The great <unk> <unk> <unk> , before he died said that his greatest fear was that , in our <unk> <unk> to this <unk> <unk> vision of the world , not only <unk> the whole <unk> of the human imagination <unk> to a <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> that were <unk> others .
And it 's <unk> to <unk> that our species is <unk> for <unk> years .
The <unk> <unk> , who gave us <unk> to <unk> , that he made us <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> with the <unk> of the <unk> , creating the <unk> of the <unk> , creating the <unk> of the <unk> , and we talk about <unk> years ago .
The <unk> world has to <unk> 300 years .
That <unk> story that I didn 't think we have the answers to all the challenges that we could <unk> to come up .
When we 're <unk> of the world 's <unk> , what it means to be human , <unk> with <unk> different <unk> .
And it 's in these answers that we all <unk> the chance of being what we are , a <unk> species , that must make all the <unk> and all the <unk> can <unk> . And there are great moments of <unk> .
I <unk> this picture on the <unk> <unk> of <unk> , when I went to <unk> <unk> with <unk> , and this man , <unk> , <unk> me the wonderful story of his <unk> .
The <unk> government has been <unk> with the <unk> <unk> and in the ' <unk> for <unk> our <unk> , we <unk> them in <unk> .
The <unk> of this man <unk> <unk> .
The family , <unk> for his life , <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> , and all of his <unk> .
You want to know that <unk> <unk> is not cold , you 're <unk> .
The <unk> of the <unk> were made of <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> of this man didn 't <unk> by the night or the <unk> that <unk> .
It 's <unk> away , it <unk> the <unk> <unk> and <unk> in your hand . When I <unk> it <unk> it , he <unk> it , he <unk> it <unk> it <unk> it .
He <unk> <unk> on the <unk> of this <unk> <unk> and when <unk> <unk> , he <unk> a dog .
He <unk> the dog and created a <unk> , with the <unk> <unk> created a <unk> , he <unk> a <unk> , he <unk> on the <unk> , <unk> <unk> in <unk> .
<unk> to talk about <unk> ?
<unk> <unk> the <unk> government <unk> to <unk> the total control of a greater area of California and <unk> <unk> together .
It 's their new <unk> . It 's called <unk> .
It 's a <unk> <unk> . It <unk> all the resources <unk> .
A <unk> example of how a <unk> can <unk> with his <unk> .
And , finally , I think it 's quite <unk> to those of us have been in these <unk> <unk> <unk> of the planet , <unk> that are not <unk> at all .
For somebody is home .
We were <unk> of the human imagination that we <unk> to <unk> . And for us all , the dreams of these kids , as our children 's dreams , become part of the hope .
So we 're <unk> <unk> we <unk> that <unk> never <unk> to anything .
I 'm going to <unk> --
It 's not <unk> , but we believe that stories can change the world , and maybe we 're the best <unk> to tell the stories of the world . Every month our website <unk> <unk> million <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> our <unk> <unk> .
Our <unk> are <unk> by millions of people .
Our work is <unk> in the <unk> to bring our public in places of <unk> <unk> <unk> from which <unk> <unk> from what they saw and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> world of diversity , and we have to find a <unk> of life in a <unk> world and <unk> .
where the <unk> of all the <unk> can <unk> to our <unk> <unk> .
Thank you .
I 'm going to talk about some of the things that I wrote in this book that I hope to <unk> other that you 've heard and <unk> to some <unk> <unk> , in case you don 't <unk> them .
I 'd like to start with what I call the " <unk> <unk> . "
The <unk> <unk> of what ?
The <unk> <unk> of all the society <unk> . The <unk> <unk> <unk> : " If we want to <unk> the <unk> of our citizens , " The way to do it is <unk> <unk> . "
The reason is , on one side , in fact that freedom is in itself a value , is <unk> , <unk> , <unk> to humans .
On the other is that if we 're <unk> , each of us can act to do all of us to do things to <unk> our <unk> , without any <unk> that we 're going to call our <unk> , without any <unk> that we 're going to call our <unk> , without anybody in the name .
The way to <unk> the freedom is to <unk> .
More choices people are more <unk> , and more <unk> is their freedom , and more about their freedom ,
This is , <unk> , so <unk> <unk> in society that nobody <unk> <unk> in <unk> .
And it 's also <unk> <unk> in our lives .
I 'm going to show you some examples of what progress has made possible .
This is my <unk> . It 's not particularly big .
I 'm going to give me a simple note about the <unk> .
In my <unk> , there are <unk> <unk> , without <unk> the 10 <unk> of <unk> <unk> and 12 <unk> <unk> that you can buy for a huge number of <unk> in the <unk> <unk> that nobody of the <unk> <unk> <unk> , that nobody <unk> <unk> is <unk> .
This is what the <unk> is what the <unk> .
And then you go to the store <unk> to buy a <unk> : <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
And in this single <unk> store , there 's a great number of <unk> <unk> .
We can make six million of different <unk> using the <unk> that there are in one store .
<unk> <unk> that there is <unk> .
<unk> fields : the world of <unk> .
Once , when I was a child , you could get all the services <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> they were <unk> by <unk> <unk> .
You <unk> the phone , you know , you know ,
And a <unk> of that , by the way , the phone never <unk> .
These days , they went .
We 're now a <unk> <unk> of <unk> , especially between cell phones .
Here 's cell phones .
My <unk> is in the middle , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> .
If you don 't have seen this in the store under the house , you 're very <unk> that soon you could see .
And what happens is that people <unk> into the <unk> and <unk> this question . And you know , you know , the answer is " No . "
It 's not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn 't face <unk> things .
So , in other <unk> of life that are much more important than <unk> , <unk> the same <unk> of choices .
<unk> <unk> : <unk> is not going on in the United States that you 're going to be <unk> by the <unk> and the <unk> you have to do .
Instead , you go out to the <unk> , and the <unk> says , " OK , we could do it . " And you can do it . " And he said , " Well , " he 's got these <unk> and these <unk> . What do you want to do ? "
You were <unk> , " What do you want to do ? "
And the <unk> says , " <unk> this <unk> and these <unk> , and <unk> <unk> these <unk> and <unk> . "
" What do you want to do ? "
And you say , " <unk> if you were me , what ? "
And the <unk> : " But I 'm not her . "
We call the " <unk> " <unk> " , " <unk> " , " <unk> " <unk> " , " <unk> <unk> . "
But actually , it 's not a <unk> that <unk> the weight and <unk> of <unk> , to <unk> the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and so , it 's not in the <unk> <unk> -- and so that it 's not in the <unk> to make the patient decisions .
There 's a huge <unk> of <unk> , <unk> to people like me and you , that if you think about it makes no sense , because we can 't <unk> .
But if we can 't <unk> , why can we get them ?
The answer is that they want to <unk> call the <unk> <unk> .
We 're so important as we 're <unk> as a <unk> issue , as you see in this <unk> . " We don 't want to <unk> kids . <unk> their sex at the right time . " We don 't get a <unk> . We have to <unk> it .
And we can <unk> how many times we <unk> .
which means that every <unk> , to <unk> , you have to decide that kind of person , you have to decide that kind of person .
We went to the family and <unk> , a <unk> perspective , and it almost almost for anyone , was that was <unk> the <unk> possible possible , and you could get kids to the <unk> as soon as possible .
The only real choice was with who , not when , and you know what to do later .
<unk> , all is really to play .
They 're going to <unk> , very smart students and <unk> them their 20 percent in less work than a time .
And not because they 're not <unk> , because they 're not <unk> .
but why am I <unk> , I 'm going to <unk> , " <unk> or not ? <unk> you 're going to do it now ? "
" <unk> <unk> <unk> later ? I 've got to think about <unk> , or career ? "
I 'm <unk> <unk> .
And they try to answer these questions , even though this <unk> doesn 't <unk> the <unk> that you can 't get the <unk> that you can 't get a big <unk> to my <unk> .
And they have to do that . They 're important questions .
Now , the job : we 're <unk> , as <unk> <unk> , because the technology <unk> us to work every day , from every corner of the planet , <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , there 's a <unk> , and I 'm not going to say anybody , where the <unk> works .
I don 't say that , because I want to use it .
What does , this incredible freedom of choice that we have about the work ? It 's that we have to decide , <unk> at any moment , if we have to work or not .
We can go to see our child , to play <unk> , with a cell phone , the <unk> in the other , and the <unk> , <unk> , on the <unk> .
And even though I 'm <unk> , every minute we see our child , we 're also <unk> , " I 've got to answer this call ? "
" I have to answer this <unk> ? I 've got to <unk> this letter ? "
And even when the answer is , " no , " that makes the experience of your son very different from what would be in other conditions .
So , from any of course , we look , and big things , and big things , life is a question of choices .
Once the world was this : <unk> , there were some possibilities , but not everything was a question of choice .
The world of today is to <unk> this : " <unk> is a <unk> thing , or <unk> ? "
The answer is <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> we all know , so I 'm going to talk about the <unk> .
We had this choice <unk> two effects effects of people .
The first , <unk> , is that <unk> instead of <unk> .
With a lot of <unk> between which to choose , it becomes very hard to do .
I 'll give you a <unk> example : a study <unk> <unk> on <unk> <unk> .
A <unk> of my <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> society . It 's about a million <unk> <unk> , with about a million <unk> <unk> .
What she discovered is that for every 10 solutions that are <unk> in more , the <unk> of <unk> <unk> two percent .
With 50 <unk> <unk> , there 's 10 percent in less <unk> than when they 're available to only five to when they 're only five of them . Why ?
Because with 50 <unk> of which to choose , is hard to decide , and the choice is <unk> to <unk> .
And in <unk> , and still <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and of course <unk> never <unk> .
<unk> that doesn 't mean only means that these <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> , because they don 't have enough money , it means that the decision is so <unk> that they also <unk> <unk> of <unk> .
They 're not <unk> , they 're <unk> up to five <unk> year from the <unk> of work , which would be <unk> to <unk> .
So , the <unk> is a <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
And I think we 're going to <unk> the world like this .
" And then , to <unk> : <unk> , <unk> or <unk> ? "
You just have to make the right decision , if it 's about <unk> , right ?
You don 't want to choose the wrong wrong , and you 're going to get the wrong wrong .
So this is the first effect . The second is that even if we can <unk> <unk> and make a choice , at the end of the <unk> of how <unk> you have been with less than what to choose .
And this for several reasons .
One of these is that with a lot of <unk> between which to choose , if you put one and it 's not perfect , it 's easy to imagine that they could make a different choice that would be better . And what happens is that the <unk> <unk> us to <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> by the <unk> <unk> ,
Even when it was a <unk> decision .
<unk> more choices there are , more <unk> than any <unk> that it is <unk> of <unk> .
<unk> , there 's what <unk> <unk> call .
Dan <unk> <unk> very well as the value that we give things to things that we <unk> with .
<unk> rest , when there are many possible <unk> , it 's easy to <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> and be less <unk> than the <unk> <unk> that is choice .
Here 's an example . I 'm <unk> with all the one that I 'm not in New York .
But that 's what you probably <unk> .
There 's this <unk> <unk> .
A <unk> place .
<unk> <unk> . <unk> day . It 's all about it .
It 's not nothing . But what he thinks is , " Well , <unk> , <unk> . "
" All my <unk> <unk> are <unk> . "
" <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in front of the house . "
And it <unk> two weeks from the idea that 's <unk> -- every day -- the possibility of <unk> where it wants .
The <unk> <unk> for what we also , even when the choice was <unk> .
And the <unk> are the <unk> we 've been <unk> , the <unk> <unk> on how to <unk> .
Here 's another example .
This <unk> tells us a lot of things .
It 's about the moment , and maybe of the living time .
But the most important point is that anything you 're going to <unk> , you 're not going to do other .
The things that don 't <unk> have a lot of <unk> that can make less <unk> what we do .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> <unk> .
I tried it on my skin <unk> a new couple of <unk> .
We 're almost always <unk> .
Once the <unk> were only <unk> , they were <unk> , and <unk> them and <unk> , and they were <unk> , only after they had a life and <unk> <unk> <unk> .
So , I went to <unk> a new couple when the <unk> were gone , and I said , " I need a couple of <unk> , this is my <unk> . "
The <unk> said , " <unk> wants to <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> ? "
They want them to <unk> or <unk> ? " <unk> " or " <unk> " <unk> " ? "
" <unk> wants them to <unk> ? "
" <unk> wants to <unk> them or <unk> ? <unk> <unk> <unk> -- " <unk> <unk> .
I was <unk> , and after a little bit , I was able to say , " I want the guy -- that was the only guy , " I didn 't know what it was , so I 'm going to <unk> <unk> , and then <unk> from the <unk> , <unk> , and then <unk> from the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> with the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> with the <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> with the <unk> store ,
It was the <unk> . With all that choice , I had the better .
But I 'm going to get worse .
Why ? I wrote a whole book to <unk> .
The reason I was worse is that with all that choice my whole <unk> was <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> to be <unk> .
I had <unk> <unk> . I didn 't <unk> anything <unk> when I was only one guy , but when I was going to <unk> 100 , you know , at least one had to be perfect .
What I had <unk> was good , but not perfect .
And after I <unk> that <unk> with what I was <unk> in <unk> to <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> in people don 't make the <unk> that these <unk> have <unk> that these <unk> <unk> with the same <unk> .
And this <unk> <unk> , even when the results are good .
<unk> in the world of <unk> if you realize .
Because if you <unk> it , I 'm not going to talk about what I 'm talking about .
The truth is more to this .
" It was better when he was worse , " The reason he was better when he was worse , it was worse , when he was worse , he was even even <unk> <unk> .
<unk> , in the world that we live -- <unk> , <unk> citizens with the <unk> of <unk> -- the <unk> that we can <unk> is that things are <unk> to <unk> .
You never have to <unk> <unk> , because your <unk> , my <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> of happiness -- what you are here -- is , " <unk> <unk> " Yes , you want to . "
I mean -- little <unk> moment -- I 'm really <unk> and my wife is really <unk> .
I couldn 't do better , I didn 't <unk> .
But it 's not always a <unk> thing .
<unk> , a <unk> of <unk> <unk> when there 's only that kind of <unk> <unk> when there 's only that kind of <unk> is that when you 're not <unk> , and I 'm going to tell you , why ?
" Who is <unk> ? " I said , " The answer is <unk> .
The world is <unk> . What can I do ?
When you have hundreds of types of <unk> , and you get a <unk> , and you 'll give you up who 's the <unk> , it 's clear that the <unk> you are .
I could do better .
With hundreds of <unk> available , there are no <unk> for <unk> .
So when people make decisions , even though the result is <unk> , they <unk> and give their <unk> .
In the last few years , the <unk> world is <unk> .
I think a <unk> <unk> -- not the only , but important -- of this <unk> <unk> of <unk> is just that people have <unk> experiences because the standard are too <unk> .
And when they have to <unk> this situation , they think <unk> it is .
So the final result is that we better , <unk> , but we 'll get worse .
Let me show you .
This is the <unk> <unk> , what we all take for good and it 's completely <unk> . It 's not true .
There 's no <unk> that a little bit of choice is better than <unk> at all , but in this doesn 't <unk> that much choice is better than a little bit .
There 's a <unk> value , <unk> . I don 't know what it is .
But I 'm sure we <unk> from a piece of the level of the level of the choices we <unk> our life .
Now , from the <unk> <unk> -- I 've been <unk> from a <unk> point of view , the <unk> is the <unk> .
What allows all this choice in the <unk> society is the <unk> material .
There are many places in the world , and you have <unk> <unk> , where the problem is not that they have <unk> choice .
The problem is they have too <unk> .
So the <unk> of which I 'm talking about is a <unk> <unk> of the <unk> , <unk> society .
And what <unk> does <unk> and <unk> is this : <unk> <unk> <unk> talked yesterday about how those <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> to be <unk> . It 's a <unk> <unk> of money .
I mean that these choices , <unk> and <unk> , it 's not that they 're just <unk> .
I 'm <unk> <unk> .
They 're going to be worse .
If a little of what we do in our society <unk> <unk> to be <unk> in those where people have too few people , it would not only their life , but our <unk> .
This is what <unk> call a <unk> <unk> .
A <unk> of income does well , not only the poor -- not only the poor -- because of this choice in <unk> that we 're <unk> .
So , I said , " You can become everything you want to be --
<unk> , people of culture , <unk> : " What do you <unk> that fish ? "
" It 's <unk> that you can 't make anything in a glass <unk> . "
" A <unk> imagination , a <unk> vision of the world --
and I <unk> it so , at the beginning .
But then , <unk> , instead , I realized that that that fish knows that fish knows .
Because the reality of the fact of the <unk> is that if you <unk> the <unk> , so that " everything is possible , " you can 't <unk> the freedom . You <unk> the <unk> .
If you <unk> the <unk> so that everything can <unk> <unk> the <unk> .
We <unk> the <unk> , and <unk> <unk> .
Everybody needs a <unk> .
This is almost certainly too <unk> , maybe even for the fish , and certainly for us .
But the <unk> of some <unk> <unk> is a <unk> <unk> and , <unk> , for <unk> .
Thank you very much .
