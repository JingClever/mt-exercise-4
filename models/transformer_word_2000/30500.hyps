<unk> year I showed these <unk> <unk> <unk> , which for almost three million years has had the size of the United States <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> of 40 percent .
I love this <unk> the <unk> of the problem because it doesn 't show the <unk> of the ice .
<unk> <unk> <unk> is , in a way , the heart of the global system .
They <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
The next <unk> is going to be a <unk> <unk> on the last 25 years .
The <unk> <unk> are <unk> in red .
And you see , it 's <unk> up to the blue <unk> .
That 's the ice in <unk> , which is <unk> in summer .
You can see that the <unk> ice <unk> , of five years or more , it 's like the blood , here <unk> from the body .
In 25 years , it 's been on like this , in the <unk> .
This is a problem because <unk> <unk> is <unk> around the <unk> <unk> around the ocean where there are huge <unk> of <unk> that , <unk> , are <unk> in <unk> by <unk> .
<unk> to the <unk> <unk> <unk> , that <unk> <unk> , that <unk> <unk> could be <unk> , and so much of not <unk> .
In some of the <unk> <unk> in <unk> , the <unk> is already <unk> by water .
The <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> ! <unk> : You 're doing the good . The question is if we <unk> it .
And so a reason is that this <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> from the north .
This is a <unk> river in <unk> <unk> .
<unk> had never <unk> <unk> <unk> .
This is the <unk> river , in the <unk> of <unk> .
If you want to know how the sea level to <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> , here is where you go sea .
These <unk> are <unk> <unk> .
On the other side of the planet : <unk> , the largest <unk> ice on the planet .
<unk> month , <unk> scientists that the ice <unk> is in <unk> , and that <unk> <unk> <unk> , which <unk> on some <unk> <unk> , is particularly <unk> in <unk> .
<unk> at six feet of the <unk> , like in <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , the largest <unk> of ice , you see new <unk> , which few years ago were <unk> .
<unk> percent of the world 's population <unk> by <unk> water .
<unk> <unk> : This <unk> is the source of water <unk> of this city .
<unk> is <unk> .
But when I <unk> , the same thing happens to <unk> water .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> is 40 percent .
<unk> <unk> are in the crisis .
<unk> , as you read , they are <unk> .
<unk> <unk> in the world <unk> <unk> to a <unk> increase in the world .
<unk> <unk> are <unk> to a normal outside the normal and not <unk> .
<unk> times more <unk> in the last 30 years of than <unk> <unk> .
This is a <unk> of <unk> .
If you look at it in the context of <unk> , if they can see it in the <unk> .
In the last five years we 've <unk> 70 million <unk> of CO2 every 24 hours -- 25 million <unk> in the oceans .
Look at <unk> the area of the <unk> <unk> , from <unk> , to <unk> , and both of the <unk> <unk> , where there is a <unk> <unk> of oxygen in the oceans .
The <unk> of global <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , which is 20 percent , is the use of <unk> <unk> .
The oil is a problem , and <unk> is even worse .
The United States is one of the two countries with <unk> emissions , together to China .
And it 's <unk> to build a lot of other <unk> .
But we 're starting to a <unk> of direction .
These are the <unk> projects over the last few years and some <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
<unk> , there is a political <unk> in our country .
<unk> <unk> and <unk> oil <unk> have <unk> million dollars in the last year to <unk> <unk> , which is a <unk> .
I 'm going to give something --
<unk> <unk> , in <unk> , where I live , there was a <unk> of <unk> billion <unk> .
You may have seen it on the <unk> .
This is the second largest flow in America .
It happened around <unk> .
<unk> <unk> of one of <unk> <unk> was this .
<unk> : <unk> ♫ ♫ <unk> the <unk> is a <unk> and happy guy .
It 's <unk> here in America , and it makes our economy .
<unk> <unk> is <unk> <unk> .
It 's good price , <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> it .
<unk> <unk> : From here , it 's a lot of <unk> <unk> .
The largest <unk> society on the <unk> is <unk> <unk> . This is his <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> <unk> . <unk> <unk> <unk> -- not know what they 're talking about .
<unk> <unk> : So <unk> for <unk> <unk> <unk> .
This is one of them , one part .
<unk> : <unk> , we see <unk> changes as a <unk> <unk> in our business .
So , for our <unk> is a great amount of money in a <unk> <unk> to <unk> and <unk> the truth about <unk> .
In fact , <unk> is not <unk> .
We think it 's got a good <unk> .
So we don 't know about climate change .
We need to do it .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> -- you 've heard about that .
So , I 'm going to take a turn into the <unk> , as <unk> is about <unk> .
<unk> ! The cars are a little <unk> , but that 's the sound of <unk> <unk> technology .
<unk> <unk> is between the major <unk> of global warming , but the <unk> technology that you see all .
Look at the one : this is the <unk> technology <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to the economic issue and the national security security .
<unk> : <unk> is in the crisis ; America is in the national security crisis .
The <unk> that <unk> all : our <unk> from the <unk> <unk> , like <unk> and oil <unk> .
Now , but there 's a new , <unk> solution for <unk> .
<unk> America : 100 percent of <unk> energy , in 10 years .
A plan for <unk> America to work , <unk> more <unk> , and help <unk> the global <unk> .
<unk> , a solution that we 're going to solve our problems .
<unk> America . <unk> more .
<unk> <unk> : This is the last one .
<unk> : <unk> : This is about <unk> energy to America .
One of the most <unk> ways of <unk> to <unk> from the <unk> that <unk> our planet .
<unk> : The future is here . <unk> , <unk> , <unk> new <unk> network .
<unk> <unk> 2 : <unk> <unk> for jobs <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> America . It 's time to be <unk> .
<unk> <unk> : A old <unk> <unk> says , " If you want to go to alone .
If you want to go back to , go together . "
We have to go far away , quickly .
Thank you very much .
<unk> year at TED I did an <unk> on <unk> .
And I try to <unk> them to <unk> how the car works .
So here we go . And for those who were not , the <unk> is the largest scientific experiment that we ever had -- <unk> miles away .
His job is to <unk> the conditions that were in <unk> than a <unk> <unk> in the universe -- up to <unk> million times a second .
This is just <unk> .
This is the car <unk> .
They <unk> these <unk> <unk> in the <unk> .
This is what I work . It 's called <unk> -- it 's <unk> feet <unk> and has a <unk> <unk> .
This is a <unk> picture of <unk> <unk> in building so you can see the <unk> .
<unk> <unk> last year we <unk> the car <unk> the first time .
And this picture was <unk> by <unk> .
It was <unk> <unk> in the control room .
It 's an image of the first <unk> of particles that had made all the turn of the <unk> , <unk> , with a part of the <unk> , and <unk> particles inside the <unk> .
In other words , when you <unk> the picture of <unk> , you know that the car <unk> , which is a great <unk> .
I don 't know if that was this to make it more or this , when somebody <unk> on Google and say that the <unk> page was this .
That means that we 've had a <unk> impact beyond that scientific .
<unk> a week later , there was a problem with the machine , because of course , these <unk> <unk> .
These <unk> <unk> <unk> when the car works at the <unk> <unk> .
Now , the <unk> between you <unk> and <unk> , " That 's not true . I 'm too <unk> . "
And they can do that because when they 're very <unk> become the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
So at least <unk> degrees , at <unk> degrees , at a temperature <unk> to the space between stars , these <unk> can bring that <unk> .
In one of the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> in the <unk> , there was a <unk> of <unk> .
So the <unk> <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a electric <unk> .
This was the result .
Now , this is even more <unk> if you think that these <unk> <unk> more than 20 <unk> , and that 's <unk> about 30 <unk> .
They <unk> about 50 <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , what we did .
We <unk> them and <unk> .
They 're all <unk> to their <unk> .
<unk> the end of <unk> the <unk> is going to be again .
We <unk> it , and we try to get some data to <unk> or <unk> , and so on our <unk> to discover what are the universe is .
Now , of course , in some way , these <unk> <unk> <unk> the value of science and engineering engineering engineering <unk> . It 's easy to <unk> .
I think that it 's so hard , the fact that it 's <unk> to go beyond <unk> , I think that 's the value of things like <unk> .
I want to end with the words of a <unk> <unk> , who , <unk> , in <unk> of the <unk> experiments of his <unk> , his <unk> was Michael <unk> , said , " It 's not so <unk> for progress in the mind as the <unk> that the ideas of the human mind as the <unk> that the ideas of science are <unk> , that there are not new <unk> , that there are no new <unk> by <unk> . "
Thank you .
I want to start <unk> to <unk> to <unk> to when , as children , <unk> <unk> .
<unk> like <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> is <unk> <unk> the way that most of the world around us .
So , as a <unk> <unk> from the <unk> of our <unk> with <unk> <unk> , and my <unk> <unk> <unk> , and I started <unk> , " And if we use a computer , instead of having the only <unk> <unk> of the <unk> as a digital <unk> that <unk> on a <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> as a digital <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> with both hands ,
and <unk> to our <unk> ?
The question was so interesting that we wanted to explore the answer , building <unk> .
In a very <unk> , a <unk> is a <unk> computer as a <unk> .
In a very <unk> , a <unk> is a <unk> computer as a <unk> .
You can <unk> them with your hand , they can <unk> them , their movement and they have a screen and they have a <unk> radio and a <unk> .
But <unk> , they 're <unk> objects , like <unk> , can just <unk> <unk> .
<unk> are the <unk> of a new <unk> for <unk> information .
And as they become more <unk> , <unk> of the movement , others , and <unk> as they become more <unk> , <unk> of the movement , of the other , the way we can explore and <unk> <unk> .
Let me start with some simple example .
This <unk> is <unk> to show : if you <unk> it in a direction , the video will be so , if you go to the other side back .
These <unk> <unk> are others .
If you <unk> them , you look at what they are .
If they come <unk> , and they can <unk> it and they can <unk> it a little bit .
If they come <unk> , and they can <unk> it and they can <unk> it a little bit .
They also <unk> their movement and <unk> .
We 've then <unk> that one of the interesting <unk> of <unk> was the <unk> to be able to use <unk> <unk> on data , for example , <unk> <unk> , a color as if it was a <unk> .
In this case , we have three <unk> <unk> as a <unk> <unk> and I can <unk> it to <unk> the color of the <unk> , where they <unk> .
and I can <unk> it to <unk> color in the central where it 's going to be <unk> .
If you get too much , we can <unk> a little bit on it .
I 'm also <unk> possibilities , like <unk> , like <unk> , mathematics and games where people can experience things , and <unk> the results immediately .
I 'm ...
This is a <unk> sequence I do with a <unk> program .
Here we have a <unk> of words that half <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> , at any <unk> <unk> a letter on any <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , at every <unk> , <unk> a letter on every <unk> , and while I was <unk> <unk> , he <unk> up on a <unk> .
Then , after about 30 seconds , you <unk> , and you have a new <unk> of <unk> and new <unk> to try .
Thank you .
Here 's children <unk> in <unk> <unk> at <unk> <unk> , I did so that I <unk> them and I <unk> a video .
They 're very <unk> .
And one of the interesting things about this kind of <unk> is that you don 't have to give people a lot of <unk> .
I just said , " <unk> of the words , " and they know exactly what to do .
Here 's other people that we <unk> it .
This is our <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , there .
It just wanted to <unk> .
They were just <unk> , for him .
Now , this is a <unk> of a <unk> <unk> .
We wanted to build a <unk> for <unk> . He 's <unk> .
It can <unk> new characters in the scene , <unk> their <unk> .
It can <unk> new characters in the scene , <unk> their <unk> .
So , it 's doing the sun .
<unk> : The sun is <unk> .
David <unk> : Now it 's taken a <unk> in the scene .
<unk> : The <unk> <unk> .
<unk> work ! Yes !
So <unk> the <unk> and <unk> <unk> can <unk> the characters --
<unk> : <unk> !
<unk> your story .
<unk> : <unk> !
<unk> : It 's a story <unk> with the open , and it can decide him how they <unk> .
<unk> : It 's a story <unk> with the open , and it can decide him how they <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> away , <unk> .
<unk> : The last example I have time I 'm going to show you is a <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> music .
It 's a <unk> , <unk> recently , for <unk> and <unk> music .
The <unk> here are <unk> <unk> as a <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> of these has four different <unk> , and you can choose which to use .
You can also <unk> these <unk> in a sequence from <unk> to your <unk> .
And they just <unk> a " sound " and a <unk> sequence . "
These are the effects that you can control from alive , like <unk> and <unk> .
I 'm going to <unk> it up to a particular sound and then <unk> it to <unk> .
And then there are the effects of <unk> and <unk> , which <unk> the entire sequence .
<unk> how it works .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> a <unk> <unk> , " <unk> in a series , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk>
Now , I 'm going to take a <unk> line .
<unk> : <unk> : I 'm going to <unk> .
<unk> : And now I 'm going to <unk> the <unk> to <unk> , so I can control the effect of the live .
<unk> : I can <unk> the entire sequence time on one side or another .
<unk> : And now we <unk> the <unk> down to <unk> more <unk> .
<unk> : I can <unk> the <unk> <unk> at the flight .
So I don 't have to <unk> before , but I can <unk> it , it 's going to be <unk> , <unk> more <unk> .
And now , finally , I can <unk> the whole <unk> sequence on the left <unk> <unk> the <unk> .
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is a new <unk> <unk> <unk> to how our brain work and body .
And today , I 've had time to show you one of the results of this path , and some possibility that we 're trying to get out of the lab .
The concept that I want to <unk> is that it 's <unk> this new generation of objects that are <unk> to <unk> with the <unk> media , that <unk> information in our world the way we want .
Thank you very much .
I don 't see the time to talk to all of you .
I 'm a <unk> .
<unk> books is my <unk> , but it 's more than that , of course .
It 's also love and love of my life .
And I don 't expect to change .
But , I said , something particular happened in my life and my career , and it took me to <unk> the whole relationship with this work .
The particular thing is , I <unk> wrote this book , this <unk> called " <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , " which , <unk> , " which , <unk> from my <unk> books , for some reason to <unk> in the world and <unk> a big , <unk> <unk> .
And the result is that everywhere I 'm going to be , people <unk> me as if I was <unk> .
<unk> -- <unk> , <unk> !
<unk> <unk> <unk> . They 're all <unk> and they say , " You don 't fear that you 're not going to be able to do better ?
You don 't fear to keep writing for all life that you can be able to create a book that can <unk> to somebody ? "
what can you <unk> to somebody ? "
It 's <unk> , you know .
But it could go worse , except that part of the time , I remember , more than 20 years ago , when I was saying to people -- I was a <unk> -- I wanted to be a <unk> .
I 'm going to <unk> the same <unk> <unk> .
And people say , " Don 't ask you to be <unk> ?
You don 't fear that the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> ?
You don 't fear to do this <unk> for all of the life without <unk> that nothing is ever out and dying on a <unk> of <unk> <unk> with the mouth full <unk> of <unk> <unk> ?
So , you know .
The answer -- the short answer to all these questions is , " Yes . "
Yes , I fear of all those things .
I 've always had fear .
And I 'm afraid of many other things that people couldn 't <unk> .
Like <unk> and other things <unk> .
But , as I 'm going to do it , I thought , is why ?
Is it <unk> ?
It 's <unk> that <unk> <unk> to be <unk> by a job that you feel like to do .
But what is that <unk> in the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to health <unk> <unk> <unk> in a way that other <unk> don 't do ?
As my father , for example , he was a <unk> <unk> and not one time in his <unk> in the 40 years of activity , where he asked if fear to be <unk> <unk> ?
<unk> 't it -- that <unk> of <unk> John , how do you ?
<unk> not that way , <unk> ?
<unk> , engineers <unk> as a group of certainly not , in <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
We <unk> , we have enough this <unk> , and not only <unk> but <unk> <unk> of all sorts of things , we have this <unk> to be <unk> <unk> .
And we 're not going to be able to look at the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> that , only in the <unk> century , <unk> young and often for them .
And the ones that don 't <unk> seem to be really <unk> by their <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , before you die , in the last <unk> said , " Every my book <unk> me a little bit more <unk> , " One of the <unk> of <unk> .
But we don 't <unk> <unk> when we 're saying why we 've heard these things so long , somehow we 've been <unk> and <unk> the <unk> that creativity and <unk> are in some way , and that the art , at the end , we always <unk> to the <unk> .
And the question I want to <unk> you to all here is , are you , are you <unk> with this idea ?
I 'm going to leave you this thing -- because I also <unk> from a <unk> distance to me , it 's not good for this <unk> .
I think it 's <unk> .
And I think it 's <unk> , and I don 't want to <unk> <unk> in the next century .
I think it 's better , I think , we better know .
And I certainly know that , in my case -- it would be very <unk> to start <unk> to that <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> in which I 'm in my career .
<unk> -- look at , I 'm pretty young , I 'm pretty young , I 'm about 40 years .
I still have about four <unk> of work in me .
And it 's very <unk> that anything that is now going to be <unk> by the world like the work that after the <unk> success of my last book .
<unk> <unk> , because we 're all <unk> or less friends here -- is <unk> that my biggest success is in my <unk> .
Oh , <unk> , thinking !
You know , that 's the kind of <unk> thinking that leads a person to start <unk> <unk> to nine in the morning , and I don 't want to do it .
I love to continue doing this work that I love .
So , the question becomes , how that 's it ?
And so it looks like , after many <unk> , that the way to work to do is to create a <unk> <unk> , OK ?
I have to get a <unk> distance of security between me , which I 'm <unk> , and my <unk> <unk> on what <unk> <unk> <unk> . And as I was going to get , as I was trying to find some of the time , to find other societies to see if you have better ideas and look at the time , and I try to find other societies to see if some of the best ideas and more <unk>
about how to help people <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of creativity .
And that research has taken me to the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
<unk> because I went to <unk> and then <unk> back .
<unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> -- people don 't believe that creativity <unk> from men , OK ?
It was <unk> that creativity was this <unk> spirit and <unk> and <unk> to men from some <unk> <unk> and <unk> , for reasons and <unk> and <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> these <unk> <unk> <unk> of creativity " <unk> . "
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> to have a <unk> that <unk> <unk> from <unk> .
The <unk> were the same idea , but we <unk> that sort of <unk> <unk> .
which is <unk> , because <unk> didn 't really know that a <unk> was a particularly as smart as a <unk> .
I thought that a <unk> was this sort of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in the study of a artist , a little artist , like the <unk> <unk> , and that <unk> out of <unk> <unk> the <unk> , and <unk> the <unk> of that work .
<unk> <unk> <unk> you , that 's the distance I 'm talking -- that <unk> <unk> that <unk> you <unk> from your <unk> .
And everybody thought that was how you <unk> , right ?
So the <unk> artists were <unk> by <unk> things , like <unk> too <unk> , right ?
If your work was <unk> , it doesn 't <unk> all the <unk> , everybody <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> by this <unk> <unk> .
If your work <unk> , it wasn 't all <unk> your <unk> , right ?
Everybody <unk> that was your <unk> to be a <unk> .
And so people are <unk> <unk> creativity in <unk> for a long time .
Then the <unk> <unk> and everything , and we <unk> this great idea ; we put the human being at the center of the universe and the <unk> and <unk> and no more <unk> <unk> space to the <unk> that <unk> <unk> from <unk> .
This was the principle of <unk> <unk> and people started to think that creativity <unk> completely <unk> from <unk> .
And for the first time in history , it <unk> to <unk> this or that artist as a <unk> rather than a person with <unk> .
And I have to <unk> , I think it was a big <unk> .
I think that <unk> to somebody , a simple person to believe that it 's like a <unk> like the source , <unk> and <unk> of all the <unk> <unk> , <unk> and <unk> is a responsibility for human <unk> .
It 's like asking somebody to <unk> the sun .
<unk> and <unk> the <unk> and <unk> all these <unk> <unk> on the <unk> .
And I think that 's been the pressure to have <unk> artists in <unk> 500 years .
And , if that 's true , and I think that 's the question , the question becomes , and right now ?
Can we do that ?
<unk> to go back to a <unk> understanding of the relationship between human and <unk> <unk> .
Or maybe not .
We may not be <unk> 500 years of thinking in an <unk> talk .
And there is probably people in the audience who <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> on their <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> people to <unk> their projects .
You probably don 't <unk> all about that .
But the question I 'd like to ask you is -- why not ?
Why not <unk> this way ?
Because it has more than any other thing I 've ever heard to explain the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> process .
A process that , as anyone who ever <unk> to do something -- so , everybody here -- know , don 't <unk> <unk> .
And in fact , it can sometimes be completely <unk> .
I did this meeting <unk> with the extraordinary <unk> <unk> <unk> , who has now 90 years , but it was a <unk> for the whole life and said that during his <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> out in the fields , <unk> out in the fields , and I <unk> it , inside the <unk> out of the <unk> .
She said that it was like a <unk> <unk> of air .
And that <unk> <unk> to her <unk> from <unk> .
And he <unk> it , because he did <unk> the land under its feet .
I decided to have one thing to do at that point and was , words , " <unk> like a <unk> . "
And so it was going to go home and it was <unk> by this <unk> , and it wouldn 't have to do anything else that take a piece of paper and a <unk> enough <unk> , and <unk> on the page .
<unk> times , we didn 't get enough fast enough , so <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> without being able to get to home and <unk> it through the <unk> and she would <unk> <unk> through the <unk> , looking for , as she said , " another <unk> . "
Then there were times -- this piece was never going to -- there were times when you were <unk> when the <unk> was almost <unk> , OK ?
So , he was coming back home and he was looking for the <unk> and <unk> them through , and he <unk> a <unk> right in the while he was <unk> , and then he was like if he <unk> with the other hand and <unk> it .
<unk> the <unk> from the tail and the <unk> in his body and the <unk> on the page .
And in these cases , the <unk> would be <unk> on the <unk> page and <unk> but <unk> , the <unk> word to the first one .
So when I <unk> it -- it 's <unk> , it 's exactly <unk> to my <unk> process .
Not a <unk> process . I 'm not a <unk> !
I 'm a <unk> , and my way of <unk> is ; I 'm going to go to <unk> every day and work and <unk> on top .
But even me in my <unk> , I <unk> against that thing , sometimes .
And I 'm going to say that many of you <unk> it .
And I mean , even though the work and ideas , I 'm going to <unk> from a source , I couldn 't <unk> .
And what is this thing ?
And how can we <unk> it in a way we don 't lose your head , but rather , that <unk> <unk> <unk> ?
As I 'm <unk> , I 'm going to say , I 'm <unk> <unk> <unk> , which I have different <unk> years ago for a <unk> .
And I was talking about this , and you know , <unk> , for the <unk> of life was the <unk> artist , <unk> to control , <unk> , <unk> these <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
But then <unk> , he <unk> , and one day while he was <unk> on a <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> it all over for him .
It 's going fast and everything is a <unk> of <unk> , that 's coming into his head as the <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , and it wants , you know , it 's wonderful , and the <unk> , but not as <unk> .
It doesn 't have a piece of paper , it doesn 't have a <unk> .
So he starts to hear this sort of old <unk> <unk> to grow in him , " I 'm going to lose , and <unk> <unk> from this <unk> song .
I 'm not enough <unk> , and I can 't <unk> that . "
And instead of going to <unk> , they <unk> .
<unk> the whole process <unk> and did something completely new .
I just <unk> the sky and said , " <unk> , don 't you see that I 'm <unk> ? "
" It seems to <unk> that a song now ?
If you really want to <unk> , you 're in a <unk> moment when I can take care of you .
<unk> , <unk> to <unk> more <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . "
And his <unk> process after this .
Not the work , it 's still <unk> as <unk> .
But the process , and the <unk> <unk> that was <unk> when <unk> the <unk> , the <unk> that <unk> out of him , <unk> , <unk> that <unk> out of him , and he was going back from where he thought it was not to be a <unk> and <unk> .
but I <unk> this <unk> , wonderful , <unk> , <unk> a conversation , and this <unk> thing that <unk> and <unk> that <unk> that but it wasn 't <unk> .
So how I <unk> that story is to change a little bit as I 'm <unk> and already <unk> me once .
This idea , I was <unk> when I was <unk> " , <unk> , <unk> , " and <unk> in one of the <unk> that we 're all working on something and we don 't really get it to think that 's a <unk> , that 's going to be the <unk> , that 's going to be the <unk> , that the <unk> <unk> , that 's going to be the book .
Not just <unk> , just <unk> <unk> book .
And I started thinking about <unk> this project .
But then I 'm going to <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
So I <unk> my face on the <unk> and <unk> my <unk> to a <unk> <unk> of the room .
And I said <unk> , " <unk> , what , both of know that if this book is not going to be <unk> , you know , don 't it ?
Because as you see I 'm <unk> everything I have , I don 't have more of that .
So if you want it to be better , you have to <unk> and do your side .
OK . But if you don 't do that , I don 't know what .
I started writing the same because it 's my work .
And I 'd like you to think that it was <unk> to do my part . " Because it 's so , it 's so , OK -- -- <unk> makes it in the <unk> Africa of the North Africa , people <unk> to <unk> the <unk> to the <unk> <unk> to the <unk> <unk> .
And they were always <unk> , because the <unk> were <unk> and they were <unk> .
But every once , I <unk> , something <unk> , and one of these <unk> artists actually <unk> .
And I know you know what I 'm talking about , because I know you 've all seen this , at some point , a <unk> like that .
It was like the time , and the <unk> <unk> through a kind of <unk> and it wasn 't doing anything different from <unk> , like <unk> <unk> before , but everything was <unk> .
And suddenly it doesn 't just <unk> as a human .
But it <unk> from the <unk> and <unk> in the <unk> of <unk> .
And when this <unk> , back to time , people <unk> what was , he <unk> the name .
<unk> your hands and <unk> to <unk> , " <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , God , God . "
That 's God , you know .
<unk> <unk> -- when the <unk> <unk> <unk> , they <unk> this <unk> with them and the <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , " <unk> , <unk> , " <unk> , " which you can hear in the <unk> or in <unk> .
In <unk> , when an artist has done something impossible and <unk> , " <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , " <unk> , <unk> -- a <unk> of God .
And it 's <unk> because we need it .
But , the problem comes after day , for the <unk> itself , when you <unk> and <unk> that are 11 of the <unk> <unk> and <unk> it of God is there .
It 's just a <unk> with great <unk> to <unk> , and maybe you never <unk> to <unk> it .
And maybe no <unk> the name of God still <unk> , and what it 's going to do with the rest of his life ?
It 's hard .
This is one of the most <unk> <unk> to do in a <unk> life .
But maybe it doesn 't have to be so <unk> if you can 't believe , <unk> , that the most <unk> of your being come from yourself .
But just <unk> that you are data in <unk> from a source of this <unk> part of your life that you have to go to <unk> another when you 're finished .
And , you know , if we think it all change .
And so I started <unk> , and it 's certainly how I <unk> it for several months during the <unk> of the book that I was <unk> , the <unk> , <unk> <unk> of my success .
And what I have to continue to <unk> when I feel <unk> from that is , not <unk> .
Don 't <unk> . I just <unk> your work .
<unk> to <unk> for your side , whatever it can be .
If your work is <unk> , <unk> .
If the <unk> , you will <unk> <unk> to you <unk> <unk> some kind of <unk> , for a just through your <unk> , " then <unk> ! "
<unk> , you do the same your <unk> .
And " <unk> ! " to yourself .
I think and I think it 's <unk> .
" <unk> ! " <unk> ! " For yourself , " just for having had love human and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Thank you .
Thank you .
<unk> <unk> : <unk> !
As you know , I talked about some of these projects on the human genome , what can <unk> and <unk> about the discovery of new <unk> .
We 're going to <unk> a new path : we started <unk> biology and now starting from that digital code , we 're <unk> in a new <unk> of biology , <unk> and <unk> life .
We always tried to ask ask ask ask ask ourselves .
" What is life ? " It 's something that many <unk> , I think have <unk> to understand at various levels .
We tried different <unk> , <unk> to the <unk> terms .
We 're <unk> for almost 20 years .
When we <unk> the human genome is <unk> to go from the <unk> world of biology in the digital world .
Now , we ask ourselves : Can we <unk> life , or create new life from this digital universe ?
This is a map of a little <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , which is the species from the <unk> genome between those that can <unk> in the lab .
And we tried to reduce <unk> the genome to <unk> a even smaller one .
We can <unk> a <unk> of genes about 500 than 500 than 500 than 500 than 500 than 500 than 500 than here .
But when we take a look at his <unk> map , it 's <unk> simple than our .
<unk> , that 's simple .
But when we look at all the genes that we can <unk> , one at the time , is very <unk> that this can take a <unk> cell .
So I thought that the only way to <unk> was <unk> this <unk> so that we could <unk> the <unk> to <unk> some of these questions .
And so we started the <unk> of " <unk> , " Can we <unk> a <unk> ? "
Can the chemistry <unk> that we 've never been able to do before we 've never been able to create before ?
And , in <unk> case , can we make a <unk> ?
A <unk> is just a piece of <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The speed with which we 're able to <unk> life is <unk> to <unk> <unk> .
Our ability to write the code , instead of <unk> <unk> , but it 's <unk> .
And our <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> on a <unk> <unk> .
We <unk> over 15 years ago .
The process has <unk> many <unk> , <unk> with a <unk> <unk> before we <unk> the first experiments .
But we 've discovered that DNA <unk> is very difficult .
There are <unk> of thousands of cars in the world that we <unk> small <unk> , <unk> of 30 to 50 <unk> and it 's a <unk> process : <unk> the longer is , <unk> <unk> .
So we had to develop a new way to <unk> these <unk> and <unk> the <unk> .
And that was our first <unk> , starting from the digital information of <unk> <unk> genome .
It 's a little <unk> <unk> bacteria .
We designed the <unk> , <unk> the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> a DNA <unk> of about <unk> <unk> .
The interesting part of the time is when we took this piece of <unk> <unk> , and we <unk> it in bacteria , bacteria have <unk> to read this code and <unk> the <unk> particles .
The <unk> particles have been <unk> by cells , they 're <unk> back and <unk> the <unk> <unk> .
I talked about recently with members of the <unk> industry that they have certainly <unk> this model .
They <unk> more than you .
I think that 's a situation where software can actually build its own <unk> in a <unk> system .
But we wanted to do the biggest things .
We wanted to build the whole <unk> of <unk> .
They 're more than <unk> <unk> code .
So we thought we 're going to <unk> in the size of the <unk> , so that we can change the <unk> to understand what the <unk> are .
<unk> is <unk> , and if you <unk> information in a computer , these must be very <unk> .
When I first <unk> this genome for the first time in <unk> , the <unk> <unk> was a <unk> for every 10 <unk> .
We 've discovered , 30 <unk> . If you were used that sequence , we never had to be able to do it .
One part of the process is the <unk> <unk> , 50 <unk> <unk> that <unk> with all the other <unk> of 50 <unk> to build smaller <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> elements here .
You probably read that that <unk> us from <unk> .
So , we have a <unk> code on four <unk> : A , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> and <unk>
<unk> of those <unk> <unk> <unk> together about 20 <unk> , and there 's a <unk> order of <unk> for every <unk> .
So we can use the code for <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
What we did at the beginning was <unk> .
Some of them were <unk> by the fact that it wasn 't <unk> .
We designed these <unk> to just <unk> <unk> with <unk> .
There are <unk> that <unk> them and <unk> them .
And we started <unk> parts , <unk> with <unk> <unk> from five to seven to seven <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> to them , so that they can get to <unk> <unk> <unk> .
We made these <unk> <unk> in <unk> so that we made <unk> so that we can <unk> create an extremely <unk> <unk> , and as you 'll see in a minute .
We 're trying to <unk> the process .
So , this looks like the <unk> of a <unk> <unk> .
When I started these <unk> <unk> , more than 100 <unk> <unk> , no longer <unk> in the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> biology .
So we 've <unk> other <unk> .
<unk> of another <unk> called <unk> <unk> , which in biology <unk> to <unk> the DNA that can <unk> <unk> .
Here 's an example .
This <unk> , called <unk> <unk> , can <unk> three million <unk> of <unk> .
You can see in the <unk> <unk> as his <unk> is <unk> .
<unk> , <unk> hours , it 's been <unk> exactly as before .
<unk> thousands of organisms that are able to do that .
These organisms can be completely <unk> .
We want to live under <unk> .
I 'm absolutely absolutely sure life in space , and it 's going to be <unk> to find new <unk> of water .
<unk> , NASA <unk> that this is .
This is a picture of the <unk> that we 've built these <unk> , just using these <unk> , just using the <unk> with the <unk> design of <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> them .
This picture was not <unk> with a <unk> <unk> , but with a <unk> <unk> .
It 's such a <unk> that big <unk> with a <unk> <unk> .
These are pictures that <unk> a period of about six seconds .
This is the <unk> we 've done a little time ago .
They 're more than <unk> code .
It 's the largest <unk> of a <unk> <unk> <unk> by man .
It has a <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> .
If you <unk> it with a <unk> 10 <unk> without spaces , you 'll be <unk> pages to <unk> this code .
Now , how do we make it work ? How can we <unk> it ?
<unk> , through a virus is a <unk> .
It 's a little bit more <unk> when you use bacteria .
It 's <unk> <unk> cells like our <unk> : you just <unk> the <unk> and <unk> another , which is basically the <unk> of <unk> .
In <unk> , the <unk> is <unk> in the cell , but we have <unk> <unk> that we are able to make a <unk> <unk> from one cell to another cell to another cell <unk> and <unk> .
We <unk> a <unk> <unk> from a species .
<unk> are different as men as the <unk> .
We <unk> some <unk> in more <unk> that we can decide which to choose which <unk> for this <unk> .
And then he <unk> with <unk> <unk> <unk> all the <unk> .
And when we put it in the cell was <unk> and <unk> our <unk> the new <unk> , <unk> the new <unk> went into the cell .
And we had to <unk> that we didn 't want to go beyond , but we 've tried still <unk> in there .
This is one of the biggest <unk> of evolution .
We found that <unk> species have <unk> a second or a third <unk> somewhere , <unk> in a second thousands of new <unk> to that species .
So who thinks about evolution as a <unk> at a time you <unk> didn 't understand a lot of the biology .
<unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> that we had to <unk> DNA .
The <unk> that was in the cell didn 't <unk> one .
The <unk> <unk> we <unk> <unk> .
It 's <unk> , and it <unk> the other <unk> as a <unk> material , <unk> it , and we <unk> with just the cell and the new <unk> .
It 's become blue because of the genes we 've <unk> .
And in a little <unk> of time , all the <unk> of a species are <unk> , and it <unk> of all in a new species , <unk> on the new software that we <unk> in the cell .
All the <unk> are <unk> , the <unk> are <unk> , and when we <unk> the code , they 're going to <unk> .
Now , this may seem <unk> <unk> , but by <unk> the software , we can change the things in a pretty <unk> way .
Now , I 've already <unk> that this is not talking about <unk> -- but <unk> progress from three million years and a half years of evolution , and I said that maybe we 're going to create a new version of the <unk> <unk> in which we <unk> new new <unk> on this <unk> .
Why do that ?
I think it 's pretty <unk> when we think about our <unk> .
We 're going to go from six and a half billion people to <unk> billion in the next 40 years .
Just to give an example : I was born in <unk> .
Now there are three people on the planet to <unk> in <unk> ; there 's four years , there 's four .
We 're <unk> problems now to find food , water <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> for six billion people .
We 're going to get to do that for nine billion .
<unk> more than five billion <unk> , more than 30 billion <unk> .
That means a hundred million <unk> a day .
When we try to find <unk> <unk> , or any kind of <unk> <unk> , it will be a huge challenge .
<unk> , we have to realize the <unk> of CO2 from these materials that <unk> in the atmosphere .
<unk> today , because of the <unk> <unk> around the world , we have a <unk> with about 20 million genes , and I like to think that are the <unk> <unk> for the future .
The <unk> industry just just a <unk> about <unk> , and think about how many different things are <unk> .
Our <unk> here is <unk> from the <unk> reality and our imagination .
We have <unk> , through these <unk> <unk> <unk> , able to create what we call <unk> <unk> .
We can make a big robot that can produce a million <unk> a day .
Think of <unk> these 20 million genes or <unk> to <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> or <unk> , new <unk> , we can change , because of a small team , and create more biology <unk> now that in the last 20 years of science .
And it 's just a standard <unk> .
We can choose to <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
This is a <unk> of some software <unk> that we 're working on to be able to <unk> and design species on the computer .
Well , we don 't know how to be .
We know exactly what their genetic code .
We 're <unk> on the <unk> generation of <unk> .
You 've seen that <unk> from <unk> was an <unk> experiment .
We <unk> <unk> second and third generation that we 're going to be pretty soon from <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> or different kinds of <unk> .
But the only way that biology can have a big impact without <unk> <unk> the cost of food and <unk> the <unk> would be <unk> the CO2 in a matter before that we 're working for cells that to achieve this purpose , and we 're working that actually able to achieve that purpose , and we can have the first <unk> <unk> in about 18 months .
<unk> <unk> with CO2 is a <unk> , but in our <unk> <unk> around the world , we 've found different <unk> .
This is a <unk> we 've <unk> in <unk> .
It <unk> in the <unk> , about <unk> feet deep at the <unk> temperature of water .
<unk> <unk> from CO2 using hydrogen <unk> as hydrogen <unk> .
We 're trying to understand whether we can <unk> CO2 , that can be <unk> through <unk> , <unk> that CO2 in <unk> , to drive this process .
So , in the short , we think we could be able to <unk> what the basic question is that we , " What is life " is , " We , we have the <unk> goal of <unk> the whole industry .
<unk> . If you can 't do this from TED , where can you ?
<unk> a <unk> source of energy .
<unk> , we 're working for using the same <unk> to create <unk> <unk> .
You 've seen this year with flu , we always come back a year and a dollar in less when it 's about finding the right <unk> .
I think that 's what you can change building <unk> in <unk> .
That 's how the future they can start looking <unk> , now , the <unk> tree , <unk> evolution with bacteria , <unk> , and then <unk> cells .
We 're in so far from <unk> people .
Our goal is to make a long enough of living enough to try to <unk> it . Thank you very much .
First of all , I 'm going to show you , the <unk> possible , some <unk> work , the new technology that we 've taken to <unk> <unk> to a <unk> <unk> a year ago .
This is a environment where you can <unk> is at the local level that <unk> with an enormous amount of data .
Here we 're seeing <unk> <unk> of <unk> photos with a kind of <unk> <unk> and <unk> , for a quick <unk> , <unk> , <unk> images as we want .
And it doesn 't matter how big the amount of information that we see , how big <unk> are these <unk> of data or images .
Most of them are common photographs , but this is a <unk> <unk> from the <unk> of <unk> , and <unk> in the <unk> of 300 <unk> .
It doesn 't make any difference because the only thing that <unk> the <unk> of a system like this is the number of <unk> on your screen in any time . It 's also a very <unk> architecture .
This is a whole book , example of data not images .
This is the <unk> <unk> <unk> . Every <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
So to <unk> that this is really the text and not images , we can do something like that , to actually show it 's a real <unk> of the text , not a picture .
It could be a way to read a little <unk> book .
I won 't <unk> it .
This is an <unk> example . This is a <unk> number .
Every image of a big picture is the beginning of a <unk> .
And it really gives you the pleasure and the <unk> experience of <unk> or a <unk> , which is for nature a <unk> of a <unk> or a <unk> , which is for nature .
We 've also done something with the corner of the <unk> of The <unk> .
We created a <unk> <unk> <unk> than you use in a normal <unk> , and we 've <unk> some of the content <unk> .
If you want to see the <unk> of this <unk> , you can see them here .
Or other models , or even <unk> <unk> .
And that 's really <unk> some of these ideas to <unk> the <unk> of space on the screen .
We think that <unk> to <unk> and <unk> other <unk> <unk> , and other <unk> <unk> like that , <unk> <unk> .
Of course , <unk> is one of the most <unk> <unk> for this kind of technology .
And I don 't want to lose time , if not to say that we have <unk> <unk> to be in this field .
These are all the streets <unk> over the United States <unk> over a picture .
So now I 'm going to try and do something else .
This is actually live on the Web ; you can see it .
This is a project called <unk> , which <unk> two different technologies .
One is <unk> and the other is a <unk> research that was very interesting that made by <unk> <unk> , a student of Washington , with the <unk> of Washington , with the <unk> <unk> of <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . A <unk> <unk> .
And it 's alive on the Web , <unk> by <unk> .
You can <unk> when we do this kind of <unk> , where we can go from an image to another and have this kind of experience <unk> .
But the <unk> <unk> of images here actually has a meaning .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and these things are all <unk> <unk> , so that <unk> to the <unk> places where <unk> <unk> all over the <unk> <unk> <unk> were <unk> . And here you see some kind of <unk> <unk> , and these things are all <unk> at the <unk> level .
I don 't know if I have time I 'm going to show you some other environment .
There are much more <unk> .
I want to spend directly on one of the <unk> data , and this is a <unk> <unk> of <unk> , and this is going to work for the first time last summer to show you what we 're going to work is really the key with this technology , <unk> . And that 's not <unk> by the <unk> , and it 's not <unk> <unk> by the <unk> that we have <unk> in the website .
We had to <unk> some <unk> and so on .
This is a <unk> from <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> and <unk> <unk> of <unk> and <unk> images of types of <unk> in <unk> , other <unk> and so on . And so on . And so , you know , you know , you know , <unk> <unk> <unk> a picture that 's discovery .
So they 're all <unk> <unk> and they 're all <unk> on the <unk> level like this .
And it 's possible to <unk> this <unk> way .
You know , I would never have thought of <unk> work to <unk> .
It 's very <unk> <unk> <unk> this kind of <unk> here .
I think we 'll see that this is a lot of different types of <unk> : that 's cell phones , a <unk> number , <unk> <unk> in this environment .
And if I can , I can , I try and , I 'm going to look for the <unk> .
A lot of them <unk> , etc .
<unk> here is a series of photographs here -- <unk> .
This is a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
We can go from <unk> to <unk> physics of this environment .
The <unk> point is that we can do with social environment . This is now <unk> from <unk> data from the whole memory of how to <unk> the earth , from the <unk> point of view and <unk> all that data together .
All those pictures become <unk> together , greater than the <unk> of the parts .
You have a <unk> model the whole thing that you <unk> .
Think of this as the <unk> of the work of <unk> <unk> on Earth .
It 's something that we <unk> as people as they <unk> it , and whose you <unk> it for those who are <unk> it with the use .
Their pictures are <unk> with <unk> by other people .
If somebody comes the idea of <unk> all these <unk> <unk> , my <unk> picture of <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> of all those data , and I can use it as a <unk> <unk> to <unk> in that space , in that <unk> , using the photos of anyone , and have a <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
Of course , a <unk> of all that are <unk> models of every interesting part of the Earth , <unk> not just by <unk> <unk> and <unk> images and <unk> and <unk> , but from <unk> memory .
Thank you very much .
Chris Anderson : I understood ? What 's your software will allow us to do is that to some point , in the next few years , all the photographs that are <unk> from anybody in the world will be <unk> <unk> ?
<unk> : Yes . What 's doing is basically finding .
It 's creating <unk> , if you want , between images .
And it 's doing the content at the <unk> of the <unk> .
And what it becomes very interesting if you think about the <unk> of information that many of these <unk> images .
As you do a <unk> <unk> and the <unk> on the Web , it 's a <unk> and the text on the page has a lot information about the images .
Now , what if that picture is going on if that picture of your picture ?
So the amount of <unk> <unk> and the amount of <unk> that is really huge . It 's a <unk> effect .
CA : <unk> , it 's really incredible . <unk> .
<unk> : I 'm going to tell you a lot .
One of the main <unk> when you <unk> and one of the <unk> research is that they can live between who who has no <unk> <unk> , <unk> the past in the wind , the <unk> <unk> <unk> by <unk> , and <unk> <unk> it in the <unk> <unk> of plants .
You may think that <unk> <unk> still <unk> over the <unk> <unk> , or that <unk> <unk> are still <unk> of <unk> , or that <unk> , the <unk> still <unk> the <unk> of <unk> , to <unk> the <unk> of <unk> , and that the idea that the world in which we live in which , doesn 't exist in <unk> sense , but it 's just a model of reality , but it 's just a model of reality ,
the <unk> of a particular <unk> of <unk> choices that our <unk> did , or bad , many <unk> ago .
And , of course , everybody <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Everybody <unk> . Everybody <unk> .
We 're <unk> to <unk> <unk> .
We have to <unk> the death <unk> , so we don 't get <unk> and <unk> --
We all have an art .
What <unk> is the <unk> of the song , the <unk> of every culture .
It doesn 't matter that <unk> <unk> <unk> , or the <unk> of <unk> <unk> , or the <unk> of <unk> <unk> , or the <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> , or a <unk> in <unk> <unk> , or a <unk> in the <unk> of <unk> .
He was my <unk> of journey in <unk> a month ago , or a <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> , on <unk> , <unk> , <unk> mother 's <unk> .
All these <unk> are <unk> us that there are other ways of <unk> other ways of thinking , other ways of moving around the world .
And if you go back , it 's a concept , it 's a concept that can give you hope .
<unk> , <unk> <unk> of the world create a <unk> <unk> life and <unk> that <unk> the planet and it 's important for the <unk> of the planet as the <unk> <unk> known as <unk> known as <unk> <unk> .
And you can think of this <unk> <unk> as a <unk> and you can <unk> the <unk> of all the <unk> , dreams , <unk> , <unk> , ideas , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> in being by the human imagination of consciousness .
<unk> is the <unk> of humanity 's <unk> .
It 's the <unk> of what we 're and what we can be as <unk> as <unk> .
And <unk> <unk> <unk> was <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , for example , <unk> that 50 percent of all species has been or is on the <unk> of <unk> , because it 's <unk> , or -- in the <unk> <unk> -- in the <unk> <unk> -- and it 's not even even <unk> to the <unk> <unk> -- that of the <unk> diversity .
The <unk> of that is , of course , the <unk> <unk> .
When you 're <unk> <unk> <unk> on this planet .
A language is not just a <unk> or a series of <unk> rules .
A language is the <unk> of the human spirit .
It 's the medium that the <unk> of every culture comes into the world .
Every language is a forest of the mind , a <unk> , a <unk> of <unk> .
And of those <unk> <unk> , as we 're sitting here at least , at half is no longer <unk> in the <unk> of children .
It 's no longer <unk> to children , which means that not to <unk> something , they 're already dead .
What 's more <unk> than being <unk> by <unk> , of being the last one to talk a language , not <unk> the <unk> of <unk> or <unk> the <unk> of <unk> or <unk> the <unk> of <unk> or <unk> ?
This <unk> <unk> <unk> was the state of somebody in the world every two weeks : every two weeks , a <unk> <unk> and <unk> with it in the <unk> <unk> of a <unk> language .
And I know that some of you know , " <unk> 't that much better ?
The world wouldn 't be a better place if we all know the same language ? " So we 're talking about <unk> .
<unk> <unk> .
<unk> of a <unk> thing that means not to be able to talk about your own language .
I 'd like to take you today to take you a journey through the <unk> --
a small journey in <unk> to give you a <unk> of what we 're <unk> .
Many of us <unk> that when I say " different ways of <unk> " I mean different ways of <unk> .
So , for example , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , the <unk> of <unk> , which <unk> to the <unk> <unk> from the <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
It 's a <unk> that 's not able to <unk> the blue color in the green because the <unk> is <unk> in the <unk> , which <unk> the <unk> .
They have a <unk> language and a <unk> rule , <unk> " <unk> <unk> " : you have to <unk> a different language .
And all that <unk> in the past <unk> , though the <unk> is that in these <unk> families that you 're talking six or seven <unk> because of the <unk> <unk> nobody 's making a language .
They start listening and then <unk> to talk to .
<unk> one of the most interesting <unk> I lived with , the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , an incredible <unk> that had the first <unk> <unk> in <unk> .
In <unk> , five <unk> have <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> .
They did <unk> from the top pictures that <unk> them in <unk> <unk> , <unk> that this <unk> forest <unk> had never seen anything .
They <unk> the <unk> , they <unk> them to <unk> a form or a <unk> , not <unk> <unk> , they <unk> <unk> <unk> , and they didn 't know anything , they have <unk> <unk> with <unk> .
But <unk> not just <unk> <unk> .
They <unk> with each other .
<unk> percent of <unk> <unk> was <unk> by their own .
We 're <unk> to eight <unk> and found two <unk> cases and we found two natural <unk> , and when we <unk> to know , they <unk> that one of them was <unk> so <unk> , and then they <unk> it . And they <unk> it . And so , they <unk> it . And they did , they had incredible knowledge of the forest .
<unk> were able to recognize the animal <unk> from 40 <unk> and <unk> the species .
<unk> <unk> , I was <unk> , I was a very interesting job when my <unk> <unk> <unk> me if I wanted to go to <unk> <unk> between <unk> societies at the base of the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
To make a sense of <unk> , I should have <unk> <unk> culture and that <unk> is not <unk> .
It 's pretty much a <unk> view of the world .
<unk> <unk> .
If you ask you to <unk> the big <unk> of the world , what do you <unk> me ?
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , etc .
A continent comes out , thinking about <unk> Africa has not <unk> <unk> <unk> . And instead and yes and <unk> is not another the <unk> of these <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> during the <unk> <unk> .
What makes <unk> interesting is the <unk> between life and death .
So <unk> are <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> can be <unk> by the <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of the live <unk> in such a <unk> that for a second , the <unk> becomes the <unk> .
So , for <unk> <unk> to say , " <unk> <unk> go to <unk> talking about God .
We <unk> in <unk> and <unk> God . "
And from the moment that you are <unk> , is the spirit that you driving you , how do you <unk> ?
So , they 're <unk> to these incredible events : <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a rather <unk> of the power of the body 's mind when it 's <unk> in a state of <unk> <unk> .
<unk> all the <unk> I have lived with the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , in the <unk> <unk> <unk> , in the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> of <unk> civilization that once <unk> on the <unk> <unk> of <unk> in <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> on the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
In a <unk> continent , this <unk> has never been <unk> by <unk> .
<unk> today I am <unk> by a <unk> , but their education is <unk> <unk> .
The young <unk> are <unk> by <unk> to three or four years , and they 're living in a <unk> world , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> for 18 years .
Two <unk> of nine years <unk> of <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , I 'm now <unk> in the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
For that time , they 're <unk> to values that they are <unk> to the values of their society , <unk> that they <unk> their <unk> and only their <unk> <unk> <unk> -- or to say <unk> <unk> .
At the end of this incredible <unk> , they 're <unk> out and for the first time in their life , at the age of 18 , see an <unk> . And in that moment of <unk> of the first <unk> , when the sun <unk> the <unk> <unk> , all that what they have learned in theory in theory , and it <unk> <unk> . <unk> <unk> does a <unk> <unk> <unk> . And he <unk> a <unk> <unk> , and he says ,
" <unk> ? <unk> as I said .
It 's <unk> . Now it 's <unk> . "
They 're called <unk> <unk> and they say that we , <unk> <unk> , we are the <unk> of the world .
This <unk> level is extremely important .
When we think about the <unk> <unk> and the environment <unk> and the old history of <unk> <unk> , which is a concept in its <unk> or maybe <unk> <unk> <unk> and say that these <unk> are closer to Earth than us .
<unk> <unk> are not <unk> or <unk> by <unk> .
There is no space for these things in the <unk> <unk> of <unk> or in the <unk> <unk> , but because of time and <unk> , they created a <unk> of the Earth , they created a <unk> of the Earth , but on a <unk> <unk> , but on a <unk> <unk> -- but on a <unk> <unk> <unk> -- the concept that the Earth can live only because it 's <unk> by human consciousness .
What does that mean ?
I mean that a <unk> of the <unk> that <unk> the mountain is a <unk> spirit that <unk> its <unk> will be a human being <unk> <unk> and have a <unk> <unk> with the mountain or the place or the <unk> of the <unk> that <unk> a mountain is a <unk> of <unk> <unk> to <unk> that a mountain is a <unk> of <unk> <unk> to be <unk> .
That 's the <unk> of a spirit or a <unk> <unk> is <unk> .
What 's interesting is the <unk> that <unk> the relationship between <unk> and the natural world .
I grew up in the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> , that <unk> <unk> to be <unk> .
That made me a human being different than my <unk> friends who believe that <unk> are the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> that live in the <unk> <unk> of the world , <unk> that are <unk> during the <unk> <unk> .
If we start <unk> that these <unk> can actually create different , we could start to understand some of their <unk> . They <unk> this <unk> .
I <unk> this picture in <unk> in <unk> <unk> .
<unk> some of you have heard about <unk> , the most powerful <unk> of the <unk> <unk> .
What makes <unk> <unk> is not the potential <unk> of the <unk> , but its <unk> . It 's <unk> from two elements .
On one hand , this <unk> <unk> <unk> a series of <unk> , <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
<unk> the only <unk> is a <unk> <unk> <unk> , but it 's <unk> with the <unk> of a <unk> 's family in the <unk> of the <unk> 's family said <unk> <unk> .
This <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , very similar to <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
If you ever see the <unk> <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> that they do from a different <unk> of the <unk> , it <unk> <unk> .
<unk> that <unk> on the <unk> is a little bit as a <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> on a <unk> <unk> of electricity . <unk> 't creates a <unk> of electricity . It doesn 't create a <unk> of the reality of the <unk> .
I often <unk> with my <unk> , Richard <unk> <unk> , the man who <unk> the <unk> was <unk> , with his discovery of the <unk> <unk> in the ' <unk> .
<unk> my <unk> is not <unk> these <unk> as <unk> because if you 're done you can 't tell anybody to be <unk> . And <unk> can 't be <unk> because they are <unk> by a <unk> , and it 's <unk> by a <unk> that 's <unk> in the <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
It 's possible to <unk> <unk> only if you <unk> with other <unk> <unk> that <unk> .
Now , the <unk> that are <unk> in this <unk> are <unk> of <unk> , the same kind of <unk> to <unk> the <unk> . The question <unk> <unk> : in a <unk> of <unk> species of plants , how do these <unk> <unk> <unk> , they do not similar , but that if you <unk> in this way , they create a <unk> version that 's <unk> <unk> that 's <unk> <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> of the parts ?
We use the great <unk> of <unk> and <unk> , which can <unk> <unk> .
But if you go to the <unk> , we say , " The plants talk . "
What does that mean ?
This <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> in the forest , and that we <unk> in the forest , and our eyes <unk> in the same species .
If <unk> <unk> their <unk> will tell us , " <unk> <unk> <unk> , " <unk> <unk> <unk> , " <unk> <unk> . "
The solution is : they take the <unk> <unk> in a night <unk> <unk> and <unk> with a different <unk> .
With that , you don 't get <unk> , but it 's much more interesting than <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Now , the problem is that the ones of us that are <unk> <unk> , but in some way to the <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> of history than our real world , and <unk> <unk> .
In fact , the <unk> century , in 300 years , not <unk> <unk> for its <unk> or <unk> <unk> , but rather like the <unk> was where we <unk> and <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> the mass <unk> of diversity and <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> the mass of diversity and <unk> and <unk> on the planet . Now the problem is not the change .
All <unk> through the <unk> have been <unk> in a new <unk> of life .
And the problem is not technology .
The <unk> <unk> didn 't have <unk> to be <unk> when they put <unk> <unk> and <unk> as the <unk> <unk> have <unk> when they put <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
It 's not the change or technology that <unk> the <unk> of <unk> . It 's the power .
The <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And if you look at the world , you 'll see that these are not <unk> <unk> to <unk> .
They 're <unk> creatures and <unk> <unk> out of the <unk> of the <unk> forces that go beyond their <unk> .
<unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> --
a <unk> <unk> <unk> , in <unk> <unk> , a <unk> that has <unk> <unk> in the forest to a generation ago , and now <unk> to the <unk> and the <unk> <unk> on the <unk> <unk> , where you can see the <unk> <unk> from the <unk> <unk> , which <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , where the <unk> <unk> <unk> , where the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , where the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> ,
<unk> to <unk> the <unk> with the <unk> <unk> to the forest .
Or , in the case of <unk> , it 's the <unk> discovery of <unk> .
If you put in the <unk> of the <unk> , where I 'm doing a lot of research , you 'll see the <unk> of politics .
As <unk> <unk> , <unk> physics of a <unk> , is <unk> at the <unk> level , but <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> , not only is <unk> , but <unk> in certain <unk> , because it 's part of the development of development .
And you can 't understand the <unk> of the <unk> until you start .
I <unk> <unk> miles from <unk> in China through the <unk> <unk> , <unk> to <unk> with a young <unk> , but only <unk> <unk> , I just got to <unk> what the <unk> behind .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> million people <unk> from the <unk> during the <unk> <unk> .
The father of this guy was <unk> at <unk> <unk> .
which means that it was <unk> in the Chinese <unk> time .
<unk> <unk> <unk> with <unk> during the <unk> that led the <unk> in <unk> .
My mother was <unk> and her <unk> was being <unk> .
It 's taken of <unk> in <unk> at the age of two years of <unk> under his <unk> because he couldn 't have no living in without him .
The <unk> , which has done the same , was <unk> in <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> and , for this <unk> , it was <unk> to <unk> jobs for seven years .
The <unk> pain can be <unk> , but the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> is from <unk> present .
And then all <unk> to a choice .
Do you live in the <unk> world or we want to <unk> the <unk> of diversity in the <unk> world ?
The great <unk> <unk> <unk> , before he died said that his greatest fear was that , in our <unk> view of the world , not only <unk> the whole <unk> of the human imagination will <unk> to a <unk> <unk> of human imagination , but a day we <unk> from a <unk> <unk> <unk> that there were other possibilities .
And it 's <unk> to remember that our species has been <unk> for <unk> years .
The <unk> <unk> , who gave us <unk> to the <unk> of <unk> , <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> , <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> with the <unk> of <unk> , creating the <unk> <unk> , creating the <unk> <unk> , and we talk about <unk> years ago .
The <unk> world has <unk> 300 years old .
That <unk> history doesn 't <unk> me that we have the answers to all the challenges that we can face in <unk> to come .
When these <unk> <unk> of the world is asked what it means to be human , <unk> with <unk> different <unk> .
And it 's in these answers that we all <unk> the possibility of being what we are , a kind of <unk> , which has to <unk> the <unk> and all the <unk> can <unk> . And there are great moments of <unk> .
I <unk> this picture on the <unk> <unk> of the island of <unk> , when I went to <unk> <unk> with <unk> , and this man , <unk> , <unk> me the wonderful story of his <unk> .
The <unk> government wasn 't always <unk> with the <unk> <unk> and in the <unk> <unk> for <unk> our <unk> , we <unk> them in <unk> .
The <unk> of this man <unk> <unk> .
The family , <unk> for his life , the <unk> away all the <unk> , and all of his <unk> .
You want to know that <unk> doesn 't <unk> , it 's going to be cold ,
The <unk> <unk> were made of <unk> <unk> fish in skin of <unk> .
The <unk> of this man didn 't <unk> at night or <unk> <unk> .
It 's <unk> away , it <unk> the <unk> in skin of <unk> and <unk> in your hand . When I did it , they <unk> it , it <unk> it <unk> into a <unk> .
He <unk> <unk> on the <unk> of this <unk> <unk> , and when <unk> <unk> , he <unk> a dog .
He <unk> the dog and created a <unk> , with the <unk> <unk> has created a <unk> , has <unk> another dog , and it 's <unk> on the <unk> , <unk> <unk> in <unk> .
What about <unk> ?
<unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> government <unk> to <unk> control of an area of bigger <unk> than California and <unk> <unk> together .
It 's their new <unk> . It 's called <unk> .
It 's a <unk> <unk> . It <unk> all the <unk> resources .
One <unk> example of how a <unk> can <unk> with his <unk> .
And , finally , I think it 's pretty <unk> at least who we have been in these <unk> <unk> of the planet , <unk> that they realize that they are not not <unk> at all .
For somebody is home .
<unk> <unk> of human imagination that <unk> to the <unk> of time . And for all of us , the dreams of these children , like the dreams of our children , become part of the <unk> of hope <unk> .
<unk> , we <unk> <unk> , we are <unk> that <unk> never <unk> to nothing .
I <unk> that <unk> --
<unk> <unk> are not <unk> , but we believe that stories can change the world , and maybe we are the best for stories to tell the world . Every month our website <unk> <unk> million <unk> .
<unk> <unk> : <unk> our <unk> <unk> .
Our <unk> are <unk> from millions of people .
Our work is <unk> in <unk> to bring our public <unk> in places that are <unk> by how they were <unk> and <unk> by how they were and , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , the world <unk> of <unk> : the <unk> world of <unk> <unk> in diversity , and we have to find a <unk> <unk> in a <unk> world and <unk> <unk> .
where we <unk> all the <unk> can <unk> to our <unk> <unk> .
Thank you .
I 'm going to talk about some of the things I wrote in this book that I hope to <unk> other you 've heard and <unk> to <unk> some <unk> , in the case you don 't <unk> them .
I want to start with what I call the <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> of what ?
The <unk> <unk> of all <unk> societies . The <unk> <unk> <unk> : " If we want to <unk> <unk> of our citizens " The way to do that is <unk> <unk> the freedom . "
The reason is , on one side , in the fact that freedom is in itself , it 's <unk> , <unk> , <unk> for human beings .
On the other one is that if we 're <unk> , each of us can act to do all of us to do everything that <unk> our <unk> , without no one who <unk> in our name .
The way to <unk> freedom is to choice .
More choices people have , more <unk> are <unk> , and more <unk> is their freedom , more than the <unk> , the <unk> is their <unk> .
This is , <unk> , it 's so <unk> <unk> in society that no one <unk> <unk> in <unk> .
And it 's also <unk> <unk> in our lives .
I 'm going to show you some examples of what progress has made possible .
This is my <unk> . It 's not particularly big .
I <unk> a simple note on <unk> to <unk> .
In my <unk> , there are <unk> <unk> , without <unk> the 10 <unk> of <unk> <unk> and 12 <unk> you can buy a huge number of <unk> in the <unk> <unk> that no one of the <unk> <unk> that no one of the <unk> <unk> is your <unk> .
That 's what <unk> is what <unk> is .
Then you go to the <unk> store <unk> for buy a <unk> : <unk> , <unk> , radio , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
And in this single <unk> store , there 's a great number of <unk> <unk> .
We can do six and a half million different <unk> using the <unk> that there are in one just store .
<unk> <unk> that there is <unk> choice .
<unk> fields : the world of <unk> .
Once I was a child , when I was a child , you could get all the services <unk> , to <unk> that they were <unk> by <unk> <unk> .
You <unk> the phone , not <unk> it .
A <unk> of that , by the way , was that the <unk> never <unk> .
These days they went .
We have a <unk> <unk> <unk> , especially between cell phones .
That 's cell phones .
My <unk> is in the middle , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> for <unk> <unk> .
If you haven 't seen yet in the store under home , you 're very soon that they 're very soon .
And what happens to the end of it is that people <unk> in the <unk> and ask that question is the answer ? And the answer is , " No . "
It 's not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn 't face <unk> things .
So , in other <unk> of life that are much more important than <unk> , <unk> the same <unk> of choices .
<unk> <unk> : No longer happens in the United States you 're going to be <unk> from <unk> and <unk> you what you do .
Instead , <unk> from the <unk> , and the <unk> says , " OK , could we do A , or <unk> , " he said , " OK , could we do it . And what do you want to do ? "
You were <unk> , " <unk> , what do you do ? "
And the <unk> says , " <unk> , " <unk> , " <unk> , " <unk> these <unk> and <unk> these <unk> . "
" What do you do ? "
And you say , " <unk> if you were me , what do you <unk> ? "
And the <unk> : " But I 'm not her . "
We call the " <unk> <unk> " , " <unk> " , " <unk> that makes it look like a beautiful thing .
But it 's not that one <unk> the weight and responsibility for <unk> by somebody who knows something , <unk> the <unk> , to <unk> , to <unk> that , to <unk> , to <unk> that no matter -- and almost certainly is <unk> <unk> -- and so not in <unk> <unk> to make decisions about making decisions about <unk> decisions about patient ,
There 's a huge <unk> of <unk> products , <unk> to people like me and you , that if you think about it doesn 't make any sense , because we can 't <unk> .
But if we can 't ask them , why do we <unk> it ?
The answer is that they want to <unk> , we call the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> of so <unk> how our <unk> is now a question of choice , as you see in this <unk> . " We don 't want to <unk> kids . <unk> their sex at the right time . " Don 't <unk> a <unk> , we have to <unk> it .
And we can <unk> how many times we <unk> .
which means that every <unk> , <unk> , you have to decide that kind of person you want to be .
<unk> to family and <unk> , a <unk> time perspective , as well for anyone , that was that you <unk> as soon as possible , and you <unk> to <unk> kids to the <unk> as soon as possible .
The only real choice was with who , not when , and not even what to do later .
<unk> , it 's really to play .
They 're going to <unk> very smart students , and <unk> them , less work than a time .
And not because they 're less <unk> , not because they 're less <unk> .
but why am I <unk> , I 'm going to ask , " <unk> <unk> or not ? "
" <unk> <unk> <unk> later ? " I have to think about children or career ? "
They are <unk> <unk> .
And they try to answer those questions , even though this <unk> doesn 't <unk> the <unk> that I don 't get the <unk> that I 'm going to get to my <unk> .
And they have to do that . They 're important questions .
Now , the work : we 're <unk> , like <unk> <unk> , because technology <unk> us to work every minute , every day , from every corner of the planet , <unk> that from the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , there 's a <unk> , and I won 't say anybody who , where the <unk> works .
I don 't say that , because I want to use it .
What does , this incredible choice of choice that we have about the work ? It 's that we have to decide , <unk> at any time , if we have to work or not .
We can go to see our child to play <unk> , with the cell phone in one <unk> , the <unk> in the other , and the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
And even though I 'm <unk> , every minute that we see our son , we 're also going to answer this call ? "
" I answer this <unk> ? " I have to <unk> this letter ? "
And even when the answer is , " no , that makes the experience of your son very different from what would be in other conditions .
So , anywhere you look , things , little and big objects , little materials and <unk> and big objects , life is a question of choices .
Once the world was this : <unk> , there were some possibilities , but not everything was a question of choice .
The world today is , " <unk> is , " Is it a <unk> thing , or <unk> ? "
The answer is <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> we all know , so I 'm going to talk about the <unk> .
<unk> this <unk> choice . <unk> two effects effects of people .
The first one , <unk> , is that it <unk> instead of <unk> .
With many <unk> between which choice , it becomes very difficult to do it .
I 'll give you an example of <unk> : a study <unk> <unk> on <unk> <unk> .
A <unk> of my <unk> <unk> to the <unk> data , <unk> society with <unk> <unk> , with about a million <unk> in different companies .
What she discovered is that for every 10 solutions that are <unk> , the <unk> of <unk> <unk> two percent .
With 50 <unk> <unk> , there 's 10 percent less than <unk> to when they 're available to only five to five to five of them . Why ?
Because with 50 <unk> between which choice , is to have to decide , and the choice is <unk> to <unk> .
And in <unk> , and again , <unk> , <unk> , and of course <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> <unk> never comes .
<unk> that doesn 't just mean that these <unk> <unk> <unk> food to <unk> because they 're not going to have enough money , it also wants to say that the decision is so <unk> that they also <unk> <unk> <unk> .
They 're not going to be <unk> to five <unk> per year from the work , which would be well <unk> to <unk> .
So <unk> is a <unk> of having <unk> choices .
And I think that 's going to change the world like this .
" And then , for <unk> : <unk> , <unk> or <unk> ? "
You know , I really want to make the right decision , if it 's for <unk> , right ?
You don 't want to choose the wrong , and <unk> the <unk> wrong .
So that 's the first effect . The second one is that even though we can <unk> <unk> and make choice choice , finally , we 're less <unk> by the result of how to <unk> states with less between which <unk> .
And that 's for several reasons .
One of these is that with many <unk> between which choice , if you take one and it 's not perfect , it 's easy to imagine that they could make a different choice that would be better . And what 's going on is that the <unk> <unk> us to <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> <unk> from choice , and the <unk> <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> <unk> from the <unk> decision ,
Even when it was a <unk> decision .
More choices are more choices , the more easy is to <unk> than any <unk> of <unk> .
<unk> , there 's what <unk> call .
Dan <unk> <unk> very well <unk> like the value that we give things to the <unk> of what <unk> .
<unk> rest , when you have a lot of <unk> possible , it 's easy to <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> and be less <unk> of the <unk> that has choice .
Here is an example . I 'm <unk> with all the ones that are not in New York .
But that 's what 's probably going to happen .
There 's this <unk> <unk> to <unk> .
A <unk> place .
<unk> <unk> . <unk> day . It 's all about them .
Don 't tell anything . But what he thinks is , " Well , <unk> , that 's <unk> . "
" All my <unk> <unk> are away . "
" <unk> <unk> right in front of home . "
And it <unk> two weeks , you know , <unk> -- every day -- the ability to <unk> where it wants .
The <unk> <unk> for what we have , even when it was <unk> .
And the <unk> that we have from <unk> , the more the <unk> <unk> is <unk> against how to <unk> .
Here 's another example .
This <unk> tells us a lot of things .
It 's about living the moment , and maybe a living slowly .
But the most important point is that whatever you want , you to <unk> not to do other .
The things that don 't <unk> have a lot of <unk> that can make less <unk> what we do .
<unk> <unk> : <unk> <unk> .
I tried it on my skin <unk> a new couple of <unk> .
They 're almost always <unk> .
Once the <unk> were just like , one , <unk> them and <unk> by <unk> , they were <unk> , only after they had a life and <unk> a lot of times , and they <unk> it up well .
So , I started to <unk> a new couple of when the <unk> went , and I said , " I need a couple of <unk> , this is my <unk> . "
The <unk> said , " Do want them to <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> ? "
You want them to <unk> or <unk> ? " <unk> " or " <unk> " ? "
" Do you want them to <unk> ? "
" <unk> wants to <unk> or <unk> ? <unk> <unk> <unk> .
I was <unk> , and after a while I was able to say , " I want the guy -- that was the only guy . " He had no idea what it was , so for an hour , I <unk> all of the <unk> <unk> , and then I was the best <unk> of <unk> I ever had .
It was the <unk> . With all that choice , I had <unk> the best .
But it <unk> me worse .
Why ? I wrote a whole book to <unk> .
And the reason I was worse is that with all that choice my <unk> were <unk> , the <unk> <unk> to be <unk> .
I had <unk> <unk> . I didn 't know anything about <unk> when I was <unk> 100 different , and I was going to be 100 different , I would say , at least one kind of had to be perfect .
What I 'd <unk> was good , but not perfect .
After <unk> that <unk> with what I was <unk> in <unk> to <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> in people 's lives not doing that <unk> the <unk> that these have respect to the <unk> of the <unk> themselves .
And this <unk> <unk> , even when the results are good .
<unk> in the world of <unk> if they realize it .
Because if I <unk> it , I don 't know what I 'm talking about .
The truth is more to that .
" And it was better when it was worse , " why he was better when he was worse , it was that when he was worse was even though he was even even possible to <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> , in the world that we live in -- <unk> , <unk> citizens with the <unk> of <unk> -- the <unk> that we can <unk> is that things are <unk> to <unk> .
You never have to <unk> <unk> because your <unk> , my <unk> are <unk> .
The <unk> of happiness -- what you 're here -- is , " <unk> <unk> " Yes , you want to . "
I mean -- small <unk> moment -- I 'm really <unk> and my wife is really <unk> .
I couldn 't do that , I didn 't <unk> .
But <unk> doesn 't always <unk> .
<unk> , a <unk> of a <unk> <unk> when there is just that kind of <unk> is that when you 're not <unk> , and you say , " Why ? "
" Who is <unk> ? " Well , the answer is <unk> .
The world is <unk> . What can I do this ?
When you have hundreds of types of <unk> , and you get a <unk> , and you <unk> a <unk> , and you <unk> who is the <unk> , it 's clear that you are you .
They could have better done .
With hundreds of <unk> available , there are no <unk> for <unk> .
So when people make decisions , even if the <unk> is <unk> , they <unk> <unk> and they give them themselves .
In the last few years , the <unk> is <unk> in the <unk> world .
I think a <unk> <unk> -- not the only , but important -- this <unk> <unk> of <unk> is really that people have <unk> experiences because <unk> are too <unk> .
And when they have to <unk> that they think <unk> is them .
So the final result is that we 're better , <unk> , but we 're going to get worse .
Let me tell you .
This is the <unk> <unk> , what we all take for good and is completely <unk> . It 's not true .
There is no <unk> that a little bit of choice is better than <unk> at all , but this doesn 't <unk> that much choice is a little bit better than a little bit .
There 's a <unk> value , <unk> . I don 't know what it is .
But I 'm quite sure we 've <unk> from a piece of the level where the choices <unk> our life .
Now , from the <unk> point of view -- I 've been almost up -- from the <unk> point of view , <unk> is the <unk> .
What <unk> all this choice in <unk> society is the <unk> material .
There are many places in the world , and you know , where the problem is not that they have <unk> .
The problem is they have too <unk> .
So the <unk> I 'm talking about is a <unk> <unk> of <unk> , <unk> societies .
And what <unk> does <unk> and <unk> is this : <unk> <unk> <unk> to you yesterday about how <unk> and <unk> <unk> to <unk> are <unk> . It 's a <unk> of money .
I mean that these choices , <unk> and <unk> , is not that they 're just <unk> .
They are <unk> <unk> .
They make us worse .
If some of what we do in our society <unk> <unk> <unk> in those where people have too few choices , it wouldn 't just be a few <unk> , it wouldn 't just be their life to <unk> <unk> , but our own .
This is what <unk> call a <unk> <unk> .
A <unk> of income does well for everybody -- not just the poor -- because of this choice in <unk> that we 're <unk> .
So to close , " You can get all the things you want . "
<unk> , people of culture , they said , " But what do you do ? "
" It 's <unk> that you can 't do anything in a glass <unk> . "
" A <unk> imagination , a <unk> view of the world --
and I <unk> it like this , at the beginning .
But then , <unk> , instead , I realized that that that fish knows it long .
Because the reality of the <unk> is that if you <unk> the <unk> , so that " everything is possible , " you can 't <unk> the freedom . <unk> <unk> the <unk> .
If you <unk> the <unk> so that it could be <unk> the <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Everybody needs a <unk> .
This is almost certainly too <unk> , maybe even for the fish , and certainly for the fish .
But the <unk> of some <unk> <unk> is a <unk> for <unk> and , <unk> , for <unk> .
Thank you very much .
