The last year I showed these <unk> for <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , which for almost three million years had the size of the United States <unk> , <unk> <unk> percent .
So , I 'm going to <unk> the <unk> of the problem because it 's not <unk> <unk> the ice .
The <unk> <unk> <unk> is , in a certain sense , the heart of climate system .
It 's <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
The next next <unk> is going to be a <unk> <unk> on the last 25 years .
<unk> <unk> are <unk> in red .
As you can see , you can see , you can <unk> up to the blue <unk> .
That 's the ice in <unk> , which is <unk> in the summer .
You can see that the <unk> ice <unk> , of five years or more , is like the blood , which here is <unk> from the body .
In 25 years , it 's <unk> .
This is a problem because the <unk> <unk> <unk> around the ocean <unk> <unk> around the ocean , where there are huge <unk> of <unk> that , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , that <unk> <unk> , <unk> this point of not <unk> .
In a little <unk> <unk> in <unk> the <unk> is already <unk> on the water .
The <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> ! <unk> : She 's good . <unk> : She 's good . The question is if we <unk> .
A reason is that this <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> from the north .
This is a river <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> had never <unk> <unk> <unk> .
This is the <unk> river , in the <unk> of <unk> .
If you want to know how the <unk> level of the sea <unk> <unk> <unk> on <unk> , here is where we 're <unk> the sea .
These <unk> are <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> other one of the planet : <unk> , the largest <unk> ice on the planet .
The last month , scientists have <unk> that the <unk> of ice is in <unk> , and that <unk> <unk> <unk> , is particularly <unk> in <unk> .
<unk> at six feet of the <unk> , like <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> new <unk> , which is new <unk> , that a few years ago , they were <unk> .
<unk> percent of the world 's population <unk> water from that <unk> .
<unk> <unk> : This is the source of the water <unk> of this city .
<unk> is <unk> .
But when I <unk> , the same happens to the water .
In California , <unk> <unk> <unk> is <unk> of 40 percent .
<unk> <unk> are in crisis .
<unk> , as you read , they 're <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> in the world 's <unk> to a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> are <unk> to a <unk> out of the normal and without <unk> .
<unk> times as <unk> in the last 30 years of <unk> <unk> .
This is a <unk> of all <unk> .
If you look at the context context of the <unk> , if you can see the <unk> .
In the last five years , we 've <unk> 70 million <unk> of CO2 every 24 hours -- 25 million <unk> in the oceans every day .
Look at the <unk> <unk> <unk> , from <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and on both <unk> <unk> , where there 's a <unk> <unk> of oxygen in the oceans .
The <unk> of global warming , together , <unk> <unk> , which is 20 percent , is the use of <unk> <unk> .
The oil is a problem , and the <unk> is even worse .
The United States is one of the two countries with <unk> emissions , together .
And they <unk> to build a lot of other <unk> <unk> .
But we 're <unk> to a <unk> of direction .
These are the <unk> projects in the last years and some <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And so there 's a <unk> policy in our country .
<unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , which is a <unk> <unk> million dollars in the last year to <unk> <unk> <unk> , which is a <unk> .
I 'm going to <unk> something --
<unk> <unk> , in <unk> , where I live , there 's a <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
Maybe you saw it on the <unk> .
This is the largest <unk> <unk> <unk> in America .
It 's happened around <unk> .
<unk> <unk> of one of the <unk> <unk> was this .
<unk> : <unk> ♫ ♫ <unk> <unk> is a <unk> and happy .
It 's <unk> here in America , and it 's going to grow our economy .
<unk> the <unk> is more <unk> .
It 's a price , <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> here .
The largest society <unk> society on the <unk> is <unk> <unk> . This is his <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> <unk> : <unk> <unk> -- Al <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> -- not know what they 're talking about .
<unk> : So the <unk> for the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
This is a part of them , a part .
<unk> : <unk> : <unk> <unk> <unk> , we see the changes <unk> as a <unk> <unk> <unk> to our business .
So , our <unk> is <unk> a big amount of money in a <unk> <unk> to make public public and <unk> the truth about <unk> .
It 's actually <unk> .
We think it 's <unk> -- it 's also a good <unk> .
So , you don 't know about climate change .
We 're going to do .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> : <unk> <unk> -- you 've heard a lot of it .
So , I 'm going to <unk> a <unk> structure of <unk> .
<unk> ! The machines are a little <unk> , but this is the sound of <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> is the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , but the <unk> <unk> technology that you see it .
Let 's look at a : this is the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to the economic economic <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> America is in the crisis ; the economy , the national security crisis .
The <unk> that <unk> all : our <unk> <unk> <unk> , like <unk> <unk> and oil <unk> .
Now , but there 's a new <unk> , <unk> solution to <unk> .
<unk> America : 100 percent of energy <unk> , in 10 years .
A <unk> plan for <unk> America to work , <unk> more <unk> , and help <unk> the global <unk> .
<unk> , a solution that we <unk> to solve our problems .
<unk> America . <unk> of <unk> .
<unk> : This is the last .
<unk> : <unk> : It 's about <unk> energy to America .
One of the <unk> ways of <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> that <unk> our planet .
<unk> : The future is here . <unk> , a new <unk> network .
<unk> <unk> 2 : <unk> <unk> for jobs <unk> <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> America . It 's time to be <unk> .
<unk> : A old old <unk> <unk> says , " If you want to go to go to .
If you want to go away , you go . "
We have to go away , quickly .
Thank you very much .
The last year I made a <unk> <unk> on the <unk> .
And I 'm going to <unk> to <unk> on how it works .
So , I <unk> it . And for those that the other time , there were no <unk> , the <unk> is the largest scientific experiment ever <unk> -- <unk> miles of <unk> .
His task is to <unk> the conditions that were <unk> less than a <unk> <unk> from the beginning of the universe -- until <unk> million times a second .
All of that is just <unk> .
This is the car under <unk> .
We <unk> these <unk> <unk> inside the <unk> .
This is what I work . It 's called <unk> -- it 's <unk> feet and <unk> a <unk> <unk> .
This is a <unk> picture of <unk> in building , so you can see the <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> last year we <unk> the machine for the first time .
And this picture was <unk> by <unk> .
It was <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of control .
It 's an image of the first <unk> of particles that had done all the <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , with a part of the <unk> , and <unk> particles inside the <unk> .
In other words , when I <unk> that picture the 10 <unk> , <unk> that the <unk> machine , which is a big <unk> .
I don 't know if it was this <unk> to make more or this , when somebody <unk> on Google and <unk> that the page was this .
What means we 've had a <unk> impact over the scientific .
So , I was a week after , there was a problem with the machine , we had to these <unk> here -- these <unk> <unk> .
These <unk> <unk> <unk> when the car works at the <unk> <unk> .
Now , the <unk> between you <unk> the <unk> and <unk> , " It 's not true . I 'm too <unk> . "
And instead can do it because when they 're very <unk> <unk> <unk> .
So , at least <unk> degrees , at a temperature temperature <unk> to that <unk> of the <unk> between the stars , these <unk> can bring that <unk> .
In one of the <unk> of <unk> <unk> in the <unk> , there was a <unk> <unk> .
So the <unk> <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a electric <unk> .
This was the result .
Now , this is more <unk> if you think that these <unk> <unk> <unk> more than 20 <unk> , and that 's <unk> about 30 <unk> .
They 're <unk> about 50 <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , what we did .
We <unk> them and <unk> .
Now , they 're all going to <unk> them .
<unk> the end of <unk> <unk> <unk> will be new <unk> .
<unk> , and we <unk> to get the data to <unk> or <unk> , and we could continue to <unk> what the universe is .
Now , of course , in a way , these <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> of science and engineering engineering <unk> . It 's easy to <unk> .
I think the fact that it 's so hard , the fact of the <unk> , I think that the value of things like <unk> .
I 'd like to end with the words of a <unk> <unk> , which , <unk> <unk> , which , in <unk> <unk> experiments of his <unk> , his <unk> was <unk> , his <unk> <unk> was <unk> , " <unk> is <unk> as the <unk> that the ideas of the human mind as the <unk> that the ideas of the mind of the <unk> of the human mind , which are <unk> , and we not <unk> . "
Thank you .
I want to start <unk> to start when , from children , <unk> <unk> .
<unk> as <unk> and <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> is <unk> <unk> <unk> to the way we <unk> <unk> in the world around us .
So , from <unk> <unk> <unk> of our <unk> with <unk> objects , and my <unk> <unk> <unk> , and my <unk> <unk> <unk> , and I started <unk> <unk> , I started <unk> , " and if we use a computer , instead of having the only <unk> of <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> a <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> ,
and <unk> to <unk> ?
The question was so interesting that we <unk> to explore the answer , building the <unk> .
In a few words , a <unk> computer is a big computer as a <unk> .
In a few words , a <unk> computer is a big computer as a <unk> .
You can <unk> them with the hand , " <unk> " between them , " I feel like to hear their <unk> and they have a <unk> <unk> .
But <unk> , they 're <unk> objects , like <unk> , you can just <unk> .
The <unk> are the example of a new <unk> of tools to <unk> the digital information .
And as they become more <unk> , <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> movement , of the other , and they become more <unk> , <unk> of the other , of how we can explore new and <unk> <unk> .
We 're going to <unk> with some simple example .
This is <unk> <unk> to show you a <unk> : if you <unk> it in a direction , the video <unk> , if we could <unk> on the other side .
These <unk> <unk> are <unk> of the other .
If you <unk> them , they <unk> them to what they around .
If they 're <unk> , <unk> and they can <unk> it , and they can <unk> it a little bit .
If they 're <unk> , <unk> and they can <unk> it , and they can <unk> it a little bit .
They also <unk> their movement and <unk> .
We then <unk> that one of the interesting <unk> of the <unk> <unk> was the <unk> that we could use common <unk> on the data , to example , " <unk> " a color like a <unk> .
In this case , we have three <unk> <unk> as a <unk> <unk> and I can <unk> to <unk> <unk> of color in the central <unk> , where you 're <unk> .
and I can <unk> to <unk> the <unk> of color in the central <unk> , where you can .
If we can <unk> too , we can <unk> a little bit about it .
I also <unk> to you know , how <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , the math and <unk> <unk> where people can try and <unk> things .
Now , I 'm ...
This is a sequence of <unk> that I do with a <unk> program .
Here we have a game of words that 's <unk> half the <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> , at every <unk> <unk> a letter to <unk> a letter to each <unk> , <unk> <unk> a letter to <unk> a letter to <unk> , and as I was <unk> <unk> , and while I was <unk> <unk> , he <unk> on a <unk> .
Then , after about 30 seconds , and you <unk> , and you have a new <unk> of <unk> and new possibilities to try .
Thank you .
Here 's a children <unk> in <unk> <unk> <unk> , I did it in a way that I <unk> them and I <unk> a video .
They 're very <unk> .
And one of the interesting things of this <unk> is that you don 't have to give people a lot of <unk> .
I just just say , " <unk> of the words , " and they know exactly what to do .
Here 's other people who <unk> .
This is our <unk> <unk> <unk> , there on the right .
It was just going to <unk> .
They were just <unk> , for him .
Now , this is a <unk> of a <unk> <unk> .
We could build a <unk> <unk> <unk> . He 's <unk> .
It can <unk> new characters in the scene , <unk> their <unk> .
It can <unk> new characters in the scene , <unk> their <unk> .
So , that 's doing the sun .
<unk> : The sun is <unk> .
David <unk> : Now , he took a <unk> in the scene .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> work ! Yeah ! Yeah !
So , we <unk> the <unk> and <unk> can <unk> the characters --
<unk> : <unk> !
... I 'll <unk> his story .
<unk> : <unk> !
<unk> : It 's a final story with open open , and it can decide him as a <unk> .
<unk> : It 's a final story with open open , and it can decide him as a <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> .
<unk> : The last example I 've got time to show you a <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> music .
It 's a <unk> , <unk> <unk> and <unk> music .
The <unk> here is <unk> <unk> as <unk> , <unk> and the <unk> .
<unk> of these have four different <unk> , and you can choose what to use .
You can also <unk> these <unk> in a sequence of <unk> .
And I just <unk> it , " and a <unk> sequence . "
These are actually that you can control from the live , like <unk> and <unk> .
We <unk> it to a particular sound , and then <unk> to <unk> .
And then there are the effects effects of time and <unk> , which <unk> to <unk> the whole sequence .
<unk> like it works .
<unk> : <unk> : <unk> <unk> a <unk> in two <unk> <unk> , " <unk> in a series , the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> other <unk> .
Now , you 'll look at a bottom .
<unk> : Now , I 'm going to <unk> <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> : And now I 'm going to <unk> the <unk> to <unk> , so I can control the effect of the live .
<unk> : I can <unk> the whole <unk> time on one side or other .
<unk> : <unk> : And now we <unk> the <unk> to give more <unk> .
<unk> : I can <unk> the sequence of the <unk> .
So I don 't have to <unk> before , but I can <unk> , <unk> more or more <unk> .
And now , I finally can <unk> the whole <unk> <unk> on the left the <unk> <unk> .
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is to build new <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and more <unk> to how our brain and body .
And today , I 've had time to show you one of the results of this <unk> , and also some <unk> that we try to bring out of the lab .
The concept that I want to <unk> is that <unk> this new generation of objects <unk> <unk> to <unk> the media , which we want to <unk> information in our world in the way we want .
Thank you very much .
I can 't see the time to talk to all of you .
I 'm a <unk> .
<unk> books is my <unk> , but it 's more than this , of course .
It 's also love and love my life .
And I don 't look like that that can change .
But , I said this , something particular is <unk> in my life and in my career , which <unk> me to <unk> the whole <unk> with this work .
The particular thing is that I wrote this book , this <unk> called " <unk> , " <unk> , " which , " <unk> " the <unk> , " which , " <unk> " " The <unk> , " <unk> , " <unk> . "
And the result is that everywhere , people <unk> me as if I was <unk> .
<unk> -- <unk> , <unk> !
<unk> to me , I 'm going to <unk> and say , " You don 't know , " I 'm not going to be able to do better ?
You don 't fear to go to write the whole life without <unk> to be able to create a book that can <unk> to somebody ? "
What can you <unk> to somebody ? "
It 's <unk> , you know .
But it could go worse , part of that I remember that more than 20 years ago , when I was to say people -- I was a <unk> -- I wanted to be a <unk> .
I 'm going to <unk> the same <unk> <unk> .
And people said , " Don 't you know that to be <unk> ?
You don 't fear that <unk> <unk> you ?
You don 't fear to do this <unk> for all life without anything that you ever come and die on a <unk> of dreams with the <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> ? "
So , you know .
The answer -- the short answer to all these questions is , " Yeah . "
Yeah , I fear of all those things .
I always was afraid .
And I also fear of a lot of other things that people don 't <unk> .
As <unk> and other things <unk> .
But , for how to write it about the <unk> of what I thought and <unk> is why ?
Is it <unk> ?
It 's <unk> that anyone who <unk> <unk> to be <unk> by a job that you feel born for .
But what 's so particular in <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> about health <unk> <unk> <unk> about <unk> health <unk> <unk> in a way that other other <unk> ?
How did my father , for example , he was a <unk> <unk> and I don 't remember one time in his 40 years of activity in which he said , if she was <unk> <unk> ?
It wasn 't there -- that <unk> of John <unk> , how do you ?
Do you not <unk> that ?
<unk> , the engineers <unk> like a group , in the <unk> , <unk> the <unk> of being <unk> <unk> .
We <unk> , we have enough this <unk> , and not just <unk> , but <unk> of all this <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
And not to look at the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that , only in the <unk> century , <unk> young and often for them .
And also the ones that don 't seem to be <unk> by their <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , before he said , " Every last <unk> said , " Every book , " I was a little more " <unk> <unk> about work . " A <unk> <unk> <unk> about work .
But we don 't know , when we say , because we 've heard these things so long that in some way we have completely <unk> and <unk> the <unk> that creativity and <unk> , <unk> <unk> the <unk> that the art , at the end , <unk> .
And the question I want to <unk> to all here is , you 're all the idea of this idea ?
So , it 's good to you know , because it 's <unk> from a <unk> <unk> .
I think it 's <unk> .
And I think it 's also <unk> and I don 't want to <unk> in the next century .
I think it 's better <unk> our big <unk> to live .
And I certainly know that , in my case -- it would be very <unk> to start <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in which I 'm in my career .
<unk> -- look at it , I 'm quite young , I 've about 40 years .
I still have about four <unk> of work in me .
And it 's very <unk> that anything <unk> of now , in the world , and it 's going to be <unk> by the world , after <unk> <unk> success of my last book .
<unk> <unk> , because we are all more or less friends here -- is <unk> that my greatest success is to my <unk> .
Oh , <unk> , that thought !
You know , this is the kind of thinking that leads a person to start <unk> to the nine <unk> in the morning and I don 't want to do it .
I 'm going to continue to do this work that I love .
So the question is , how ?
And so I think , after many <unk> , that the way to work to continue and write to write is to create a <unk> <unk> <unk> , OK ?
I have to find a <unk> distance of security in me , which I 'm <unk> , and the natural <unk> on which I 'm <unk> , and my <unk> <unk> to do it , and as I was going to <unk> to find other <unk> , and <unk> to find other <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> and <unk> , and more <unk> , and <unk> and <unk> , and <unk>
about how to help people <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of creativity .
And that research <unk> me to <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
<unk> because I was going to go back and then <unk> back .
<unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> -- people don 't think that <unk> creativity from men , OK ?
It <unk> that creativity was this spirit <unk> <unk> and <unk> to men from a some <unk> <unk> and <unk> , for reasons <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of creativity " <unk> " <unk> " creativity . "
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> to have a <unk> that <unk> <unk> from away .
The <unk> were the same idea , but <unk> that 's <unk> of the spirit without a <unk> .
And the <unk> , because the <unk> doesn 't really <unk> that a <unk> was somebody who was particularly <unk> .
And I thought a <unk> was this sort of <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> literally <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk> of a artist , a little like <unk> <unk> , and that <unk> out of <unk> <unk> the <unk> of that work .
So , <unk> <unk> , that 's the distance of what I 'm talking about -- that <unk> that <unk> you <unk> from the results of your work .
And all of <unk> that was so that <unk> , right ?
So the artists were <unk> by <unk> things , like the too <unk> , like the too <unk> , right ?
If your work was <unk> , you know , you know , <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> , all of <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> .
If your work <unk> , it wasn 't all <unk> your <unk> , right ?
Everybody <unk> that was your <unk> to be a <unk> .
And so the people <unk> <unk> creativity in <unk> for a long time .
Then the <unk> <unk> and all <unk> , and we <unk> this big idea ; we put the human <unk> on the universe on the center of the universe , and the <unk> and the <unk> and <unk> without <unk> space to <unk> .
This was the principle of <unk> <unk> and people <unk> to think that creativity <unk> completely <unk> from the <unk> .
And for the first time in the history , <unk> to <unk> this , or that artist as a <unk> <unk> that to a person with the <unk> .
And I have to <unk> , I think it was a big <unk> .
I think I would like to somebody , a simple person to believe that they 're like a <unk> , <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> and <unk> a <unk> responsibility .
It 's like to ask somebody of <unk> the sun .
<unk> and <unk> completely <unk> and <unk> all these <unk> <unk> on the <unk> .
And I think it 's the pressure to have <unk> artists in the <unk> 500 years .
And if this is true , and I think that 's the question , the question is , and now ?
Can we do that ?
We could go back to a <unk> <unk> of the relationship between humans and <unk> <unk> .
Or maybe not .
Maybe we can 't <unk> 500 years of thinking in a <unk> <unk> of <unk> 18 minutes .
And there 's probably people in the audience that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> on the <unk> of <unk> , <unk> people <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> about their projects .
You can 't tell you all about this .
But the question I would like to <unk> is -- why ?
Why do not <unk> in this way ?
because it 's more than any other thing that ever heard to explain the <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
A process that , as anyone who ever <unk> to do something -- so , basically , all here -- you know , you know , you don 't know , <unk> <unk> .
And in fact , it can be completely <unk> .
I did this <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , who 's now <unk> <unk> , who 's a <unk> for all life and said that during his <unk> <unk> , and he said that during his <unk> <unk> , <unk> out in the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> out in the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> out in the <unk> .
He said , it was like a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And that <unk> <unk> to her from the <unk> .
I <unk> it to it , because he was <unk> the land under his feet .
<unk> to have one thing to do at that point and was , his words , " <unk> as a <unk> . "
And so I was going to <unk> and <unk> from this <unk> , and it wouldn 't have to get another one piece of paper and a little quickly , as <unk> , <unk> and <unk> on the page .
And sometimes I didn 't <unk> to be enough , so <unk> and <unk> and <unk> without able to get home and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> through the <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> through the <unk> , looking for , as she said , " another <unk> . "
Then there were those times -- this piece of never <unk> -- there were the <unk> of times that the <unk> was almost <unk> , OK ?
So , was <unk> home and he was looking at home and <unk> the <unk> through , and I was <unk> a <unk> in the while that was <unk> , and then he was like , and he was like to <unk> with the other hand and the <unk> .
<unk> the tail and the <unk> on the tail and the <unk> on the page .
And in these cases , the <unk> would be <unk> on the <unk> page and <unk> , but the <unk> , the last word to the first <unk> .
So when I <unk> it -- it 's <unk> , it 's exactly <unk> to my <unk> process .
I don 't all my <unk> process -- I 'm not a <unk> .
I 'm a <unk> , and my way of <unk> is ; it <unk> at the same <unk> every day and work and work and work and <unk> on <unk> .
But even I even in my <unk> , I <unk> against that thing , sometimes .
And I would think that many of you <unk> the <unk> .
You know , even though the work and the ideas <unk> me to <unk> from a certain source , I couldn 't <unk> .
And what is this thing ?
And how can we <unk> to it in a way we can 't <unk> your head , but rather , rather , that <unk> <unk> us ?
For how I 'm about the best example I have is the <unk> <unk> <unk> , which I <unk> different years ago for a <unk> .
<unk> <unk> of this , and you know , <unk> , for the <unk> of life was the <unk> of the artist artist <unk> , <unk> these species of <unk> <unk> <unk> .
But then <unk> , he was <unk> , and a day when he was <unk> on a <unk> <unk> , <unk> everything for him .
<unk> fast and <unk> and <unk> it up and <unk> this little <unk> of <unk> , who comes into his head as a <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , and the <unk> , you know , it 's wonderful and the <unk> , but not as <unk> .
It doesn 't have a piece , it doesn 't have a <unk> , it doesn 't have a <unk> .
So , he starts to hear this sort of old <unk> <unk> <unk> in him , " I 'm going to <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> from this <unk> song .
I 'm not enough to <unk> and I can 't <unk> . "
And instead of go to <unk> , they <unk> .
<unk> the whole process <unk> and made something completely new .
You just know the sky and said , " <unk> , you don 't see that I 'm <unk> ? "
" Do you think you can write a song now ?
If you really want to <unk> , <unk> in a <unk> moment when I can <unk> care of you .
<unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> more today .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . "
And his <unk> process after this .
I didn 't work , the work was still <unk> as always .
But the process , and the <unk> <unk> that <unk> was <unk> when <unk> the <unk> , the <unk> that outside he was <unk> , the <unk> that outside , the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> that was <unk> that it had no <unk> , and <unk> .
but I <unk> this <unk> , <unk> <unk> a conversation between <unk> and this thing <unk> and <unk> , but it was not <unk> .
So , as I was <unk> to change a little bit of the way I 'm <unk> and <unk> me a time .
This idea , I was <unk> when I was <unk> , " <unk> , " <unk> , " <unk> , " and I <unk> in a <unk> of those <unk> <unk> in which we 're working on something and we can think that 's going to be a <unk> , which is the <unk> , that what the book is going to be .
Not just to <unk> , just <unk> the book .
And I started thinking about <unk> this project .
But then I <unk> to <unk> that <unk> to <unk> the air and <unk> us .
So I <unk> my face in the <unk> and <unk> my <unk> to a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And I said to <unk> , " <unk> , " <unk> , " <unk> , what if this book is going to be <unk> my <unk> , right ?
because you see how I 'm <unk> everything I have , I don 't have more than that I 've not more than that .
So if you want that to be better , you have to <unk> and do your part .
OK . But if you don 't do it , you know what , I don 't do it .
I 'm going to write the same because it 's my work .
And I would like to do that that I 'm <unk> to do my part of the " because -- at the end is , OK -- <unk> , <unk> <unk> , people <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> , people <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> music , <unk> , <unk> music , <unk> , <unk> , and until <unk> .
And they were always <unk> , because the <unk> were <unk> .
But every long , <unk> , something <unk> , and one of these <unk> artists , <unk> , <unk> .
And I know you know what I 'm talking about , because I know that you 've all seen , a <unk> .
It was like the time , and the <unk> <unk> through a kind of <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And it 's not just like a human .
But they <unk> from <unk> and <unk> in the <unk> of <unk> .
And when this <unk> , the <unk> people <unk> what was , the people <unk> what was , <unk> the <unk> .
<unk> hands and <unk> to <unk> , " <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , God , " God , " God , " God , "
That 's God , you know .
<unk> <unk> -- when the <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> this <unk> with them and <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> , " <unk> , " <unk> , " <unk> , " <unk> , " <unk> , " <unk> , " <unk> , " <unk> , " <unk> , " <unk> , " <unk> , " <unk> , " <unk> , " <unk> , " <unk> , " <unk> , " <unk> , " <unk> , " <unk> , " <unk> , " <unk> , " <unk> , " <unk> , " <unk> , "
In <unk> , when a artist did something impossible and <unk> , " <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , " <unk> , <unk> , " <unk> , <unk> -- a <unk> of God .
And it 's <unk> because we need .
But the problem comes after , for the <unk> , for the <unk> , when you <unk> and <unk> that are <unk> <unk> of <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> . <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . There 's no more .
It 's just a <unk> <unk> <unk> , and maybe not <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And maybe nobody <unk> the name of God still as <unk> , and what 's going to do with the rest of his life ?
It 's hard .
This is one of the <unk> <unk> to do in a <unk> life .
But maybe it 's not to be so <unk> if you could not believe , <unk> , that the most <unk> of your being being being being being being being being being being being being being being being <unk> .
But I just <unk> that you have data in <unk> from a source of this <unk> part of your life that you have to <unk> .
And , you know , if we think about this .
And so I started <unk> , and it 's <unk> like I <unk> it for different months during the <unk> of the book that I was <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> of my <unk> success .
And what I 'm going to continue to <unk> when I feel <unk> from this is , not <unk> .
Don 't <unk> . You can 't just <unk> your work .
<unk> to <unk> for your part , any <unk> can be .
If your work is <unk> , <unk> .
If you <unk> , you 'll <unk> to <unk> you <unk> some kind of <unk> , for a moment , just through your <unk> , " <unk> ! "
<unk> , do the same <unk> .
And " <unk> ! " <unk> ! "
I think I and I think I would <unk> .
" <unk> ! " <unk> ! " <unk> ! " <unk> ! " <unk> " <unk> " <unk> " <unk> . "
Thank you .
Thank you .
<unk> <unk> : <unk> !
As you know , I 've talked about some of these projects on the human genome , what can <unk> and <unk> new genes .
Now we 're <unk> a new <unk> , we started <unk> biology and now start to <unk> biology and now start to that digital code of biology , <unk> and <unk> life .
We always tried to <unk> big questions .
" <unk> is life ? " It 's something that many <unk> I think they have <unk> to understand various levels .
We tried different <unk> , <unk> to <unk> terms .
We 're <unk> from almost 20 years .
When we <unk> the human genome <unk> to <unk> from the world of biology in the digital world of the digital world .
Now , we can we <unk> life , or create new life from this digital universe ?
This is the map of a little <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> , which is the species from the <unk> of the <unk> that can <unk> in lab .
And we tried to <unk> the genome to <unk> a <unk> .
We are able to <unk> a <unk> of genes of about 500 that are here .
But when we take a look at his map , it 's <unk> simple than our .
<unk> , this is simple .
But when we look at all the genes that we can <unk> , one at the time , is very <unk> that this can bring a <unk> cell .
So I thought the only way to <unk> was <unk> this <unk> <unk> to <unk> some of these questions .
So we started the <unk> of " Can we <unk> a <unk> ? "
Can you do the chemistry of produce these big molecules that we never <unk> to create these big molecules that we 've never been able to create before ?
And in case , <unk> , can we <unk> a <unk> ?
A <unk> is just a piece of <unk> material .
The speed with which we are able to <unk> life is <unk> <unk> .
Our ability to write the code , instead , rather slowly , but it 's <unk> .
And our <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
We <unk> more than 15 years ago .
The process has <unk> a lot of <unk> , <unk> with a <unk> <unk> before <unk> the first experiments .
But we found that <unk> of DNA is very difficult .
There are <unk> of thousands of machines in the world that <unk> little <unk> of DNA , <unk> of 30 to 50 <unk> and it 's a <unk> process : more <unk> , <unk> is a <unk> process : the <unk> is a <unk> <unk> , <unk> is a <unk> process .
So we had to develop a new way to <unk> these <unk> and <unk> the <unk> .
And this was our first <unk> , to go from the digital information of <unk> <unk> <unk> .
It 's a little virus that we can <unk> .
We designed the <unk> , <unk> the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> a <unk> of DNA <unk> <unk> .
The interesting part is when we took this piece of <unk> material , and we <unk> it in bacteria , the bacteria have <unk> to read this code and <unk> <unk> .
<unk> particles are <unk> by cells , they 're <unk> back and <unk> <unk> .
I talked about recently with the <unk> <unk> industry that they have certainly <unk> this model .
They have more than you .
And that 's a situation where the software can really build his own <unk> in a <unk> system .
But I would do the largest things in big .
We could build the whole <unk> of <unk> .
It 's more than <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
So we thought we thought about <unk> in <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , so that we can change the <unk> to understand what the <unk> of a <unk> cell .
The <unk> is <unk> , and if we <unk> information in a computer , these must be very <unk> .
When I was <unk> this genome for the first time in <unk> <unk> , it was a <unk> for every 10 <unk> <unk> .
We found , <unk> , 30 <unk> . If we were <unk> that original sequence , you could never <unk> to do it .
One part of the process is to design <unk> 50 <unk> that <unk> <unk> with all the other <unk> of 50 <unk> to build little little little <unk> .
We 're going to be <unk> .
You 've probably read that <unk> us about the <unk> .
So , we have a <unk> code <unk> on four <unk> : <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> of those <unk> <unk> <unk> together about 20 <unk> , and there 's a <unk> order to <unk> .
So we can use the code to write words , <unk> .
What we did at the beginning is <unk> .
Some of them were <unk> by the fact that it wasn 't <unk> .
We designed these <unk> to <unk> <unk> , just <unk> <unk> .
There are <unk> that <unk> them and <unk> them .
And we started to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
In every step , we 've made these <unk> in <unk> <unk> , because we 're <unk> that we 're <unk> to create a very <unk> <unk> , as you 'll see in a minute .
We 're trying to <unk> the process .
So , this looks like the <unk> of a <unk> <unk> .
When I <unk> to these <unk> <unk> , more than 100 <unk> <unk> , not <unk> directly to the <unk> <unk> .
It 's <unk> to the <unk> of <unk> biology .
So we 've <unk> other <unk> .
We <unk> of another <unk> called <unk> <unk> , which in biology <unk> to <unk> the DNA that in biology <unk> <unk> .
Here 's a example .
This <unk> , called <unk> <unk> , can <unk> three million <unk> <unk> .
You can see in the <unk> <unk> as his <unk> <unk> .
In 12 hours -- it 's <unk> exactly how it was before .
<unk> thousands of organisms that are able to do that .
These organisms can <unk> completely .
We 're going to be <unk> .
It 's absolutely absolutely sure that life <unk> in space , and they <unk> to find new <unk> of water .
And that NASA is true , NASA has shown that this is .
This is a picture of the <unk> that we 've built using these <unk> , just using these <unk> , just using the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> them .
This is not <unk> with a <unk> <unk> , but with a <unk> <unk> .
It 's a <unk> that big <unk> that we can <unk> with a <unk> <unk> .
These are pictures that <unk> a period of about six seconds .
This is the <unk> that we did a little time ago .
It 's more than <unk> <unk> code .
It 's the largest <unk> of a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
It 's got a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
If you <unk> it with a <unk> 10 without the <unk> , we 'll <unk> pages to <unk> this code .
Now , how do we do it ? How can we <unk> ?
Of course , through a virus is a game of kids .
It 's a little more <unk> when you use of bacteria .
It 's more simple when it 's <unk> cells as our : you can just <unk> the <unk> and <unk> another , which is a <unk> <unk> . which is <unk> <unk> .
In <unk> , the <unk> <unk> is instead of <unk> in the cell , but we <unk> <unk> that we are able to do a <unk> <unk> of a <unk> cell to another and <unk> .
We <unk> a <unk> <unk> from a sort of <unk> .
<unk> are different as as men .
We 've <unk> some <unk> <unk> in the way we could decide what to do for this <unk> .
And then he <unk> with the <unk> <unk> <unk> all the <unk> .
And when we put it in the cell , and we <unk> our <unk> <unk> <unk> the new <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And we had to <unk> that we don 't go beyond , but we tried to <unk> more in there .
This is one of the largest <unk> of evolution .
We found that <unk> species have <unk> a second or a third <unk> , or a third <unk> , <unk> in a second thousands of new <unk> <unk> .
So who think of evolution as a only <unk> at time they <unk> doesn 't understand most <unk> of biology .
We <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> that was in the cell not <unk> one .
The <unk> <unk> that we <unk> .
It 's <unk> , and it <unk> the other <unk> as <unk> material , <unk> <unk> , and <unk> it with only the cell and the new <unk> .
It 's <unk> blue because of the genes that we <unk> .
And in a short <unk> of time , all the <unk> of a species are <unk> , and it 's <unk> of all over a new species , <unk> on the new software that we have <unk> in the cell .
All the <unk> are <unk> , the <unk> are <unk> , and when you <unk> the code <unk> exactly exactly what we have <unk> .
Now , this could be <unk> <unk> , but we can <unk> the software , we can change things in a way .
Now , I 've already <unk> that here is not about <unk> <unk> -- but to <unk> progress , and I 've been <unk> that maybe we 're going to create a new version of the <unk> <unk> in which we 're <unk> new <unk> version of <unk> in this process , <unk> , <unk> new species on this <unk> , new species on this process .
Why do that ?
I think it 's enough to <unk> when we think of our <unk> .
We 're going to go from six billion people to <unk> billion in the next 40 years .
Right to give you a example : I was born in <unk> .
Now , there 's three people on the planet to <unk> <unk> in the <unk> ; in 40 years , there will be four .
We 're <unk> problems now at <unk> , <unk> <unk> and <unk> , <unk> and <unk> and <unk> for six billion people .
We 're <unk> to do that for nine billion .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , more than 30 billion <unk> <unk> <unk> .
That means percent million <unk> a day .
When we try to find <unk> <unk> , or any kind of <unk> process to <unk> , it will be a huge challenge .
We have to <unk> the whole <unk> of CO2 from these materials that <unk> in the atmosphere .
At the day , in the <unk> <unk> <unk> all over the world , we have a <unk> with about 20 million genes , and I like to think that are the <unk> for the future .
The <unk> industry is just a <unk> about <unk> , and think about how many different things are <unk> out .
Our <unk> here are data from the reality of <unk> and from the <unk> of the imagination .
Now we have <unk> , because of these <unk> <unk> <unk> , able to create what we call <unk> <unk> .
We 're able to build a big robot that can produce a big robot that can produce a million <unk> a day .
Think of <unk> these 20 million genes or <unk> to <unk> the <unk> to produce <unk> or <unk> , new <unk> , new <unk> , we can change , <unk> , we can change , because of a little team , and to create more biology that we can change , and create <unk> biology .
And it 's just a standard <unk> .
We can choose to <unk> <unk> , chemistry or <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
This is a <unk> of some software <unk> that we 're working on to be able to <unk> and design species to computers .
Well , we don 't know how to be .
We know exactly how their <unk> code .
Now we 're <unk> on the <unk> of <unk> generation .
You 've seen seen that <unk> <unk> from <unk> was a <unk> experiment .
We <unk> <unk> <unk> and the third generation that we had enough to <unk> <unk> <unk> , like <unk> <unk> or different kinds of <unk> .
But the only way that biology can have a big impact without <unk> the cost of food and <unk> the cost of food and <unk> the <unk> would be <unk> CO2 in matter , which we 're working for cells that we are getting this <unk> , and we think we can have the first <unk> of <unk> in about 18 months .
<unk> light <unk> with CO2 is a <unk> , but in our <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of the world , we found different <unk> .
This is a <unk> that we <unk> in <unk> .
<unk> in the ocean , at about <unk> feet of the <unk> temperature of water .
<unk> <unk> from CO2 using hydrogen <unk> as hydrogen <unk> .
We 're trying to understand whether we can <unk> CO2 , that can easily be <unk> by <unk> , <unk> that can easily be <unk> by <unk> , to drive this process .
So , the short short of the <unk> we could be able to <unk> what the question of " which is the <unk> of <unk> that what is life is . We have the <unk> goal of <unk> <unk> the whole <unk> industry .
<unk> . If you can 't do that TED , where you can ?
It 's a main source of energy .
<unk> , we 're working on to use the same <unk> to create <unk> <unk> .
You 've seen this year with flu , we 're always back a year and with a dollar in less when it 's about <unk> <unk> .
I think what 's going to change building <unk> <unk> .
So , that 's how to start <unk> , now , the tree of evolution , <unk> the evolution of evolution , <unk> , <unk> cells .
We are at the way of the people .
Our goal is to do so so that we 're going to <unk> to try to try to <unk> . Thank you very much .
First of all , I 'll show you , the <unk> <unk> as possible , some fundamental work , some fundamental work , that we <unk> to <unk> a <unk> <unk> almost a year ago . This is <unk> .
It 's a environment where you can <unk> is at local level that <unk> with a huge amount of data .
Here we 're seeing <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> , for a <unk> <unk> , <unk> the images as we want .
And it doesn 't matter how big the amount of information that we see , how big these <unk> of data or the images .
Most of the <unk> are common photographs , but this for example is a <unk> <unk> from the <unk> of <unk> , and <unk> in the <unk> of 300 <unk> .
It doesn 't do any difference because the only thing that <unk> the <unk> of a system like this is the number of <unk> on your screen . It 's also a very <unk> architecture .
This is a whole book , example of data , example , not to images .
This is <unk> <unk> <unk> . Every <unk> <unk> <unk> .
So , to <unk> that 's really about the <unk> and not about images , we can do something like that , to see that really , to see that it 's a real <unk> <unk> , not a picture .
It could be a way to read a little bit <unk> for read a book .
I 'm not going to show you .
This is a <unk> <unk> . It 's a <unk> <unk> . It 's a number of <unk> .
Every picture is the beginning of a <unk> .
And it 's really the pleasure and the <unk> experience of read the real version of a <unk> or a <unk> , which is for nature a <unk> of a half a <unk> <unk> .
We also did something with the corner of this , in particular <unk> of the <unk> .
We 've created a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that you use in a normal <unk> , and we 've <unk> <unk> <unk> .
If you want to see the <unk> of this <unk> , you can see here .
Or other models , or even <unk> <unk> .
And this really <unk> some of these ideas to <unk> the <unk> of space on the screen .
So , I think this <unk> to put the <unk> and <unk> other <unk> <unk> , not to be <unk> .
Of course , the <unk> is one of the <unk> <unk> for this kind of technology .
And on this , I don 't want to lose time , if we don 't say that we have <unk> to <unk> .
These are all the <unk> in the U.S. <unk> on a <unk> picture of NASA .
So now I 'm going to start to something else .
This is actually actually in the web ; you can see .
It 's a project called <unk> , which <unk> two different technologies .
A <unk> is <unk> and the other is a <unk> research that 's very interesting <unk> to <unk> <unk> , a student of Washington <unk> , with help <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . A <unk> <unk> . A <unk> <unk> . A <unk> <unk> .
And it 's alive on the web , <unk> <unk> .
You can <unk> when we do this kind of <unk> , where we can <unk> from a picture to the other and have this kind of experience to <unk> .
But the <unk> <unk> of images here , actually , a meaning .
And the <unk> of computers have <unk> these images , so so that <unk> to <unk> the <unk> <unk> in which <unk> <unk> all <unk> <unk> <unk> on the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and these things are all <unk> . And these things are all <unk> .
I don 't know if I 've got to show you some other environment .
There 's a lot more <unk> .
I want to go to one of the <unk> of <unk> data and this <unk> from a <unk> <unk> <unk> that we did work for the first time to show you what 's really about is the key to show you what it is really the key to show you that we have in the website .
We had to <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
This is a <unk> <unk> <unk> images from <unk> <unk> <unk> . <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> images of <unk> in <unk> , other <unk> and <unk> and <unk> . He said . <unk> of these <unk> <unk> , and so on .
So I 'm all <unk> images , and they 're all <unk> <unk> at the <unk> level in this way .
And it 's possible to <unk> it in this <unk> way .
You know , I would never thought to end up to work to <unk> .
It 's very <unk> <unk> this kind of <unk> here .
I think I would see that it 's a lot of different kinds of <unk> : from those phones <unk> <unk> , a number , <unk> <unk> , a number , <unk> <unk> together in this environment .
And if I can , I can try and look at those <unk> .
Many of them are <unk> <unk> , etc .
And then , there 's a series of photographs -- <unk> .
This is a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
We can <unk> from the physics of this environment .
The <unk> point is that we can do things with social environment . This is now <unk> data from the whole memory of the whole memory of how to <unk> the land , from the point of <unk> and <unk> all of the data .
All of those pictures become <unk> together , <unk> of the <unk> of the parts .
You have a model of the whole thing that <unk> .
Think of this as a <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> on Earth .
It 's something that <unk> in <unk> complexity as people <unk> , and the <unk> that <unk> to the use of the use of the use of <unk> .
Their pictures are <unk> with <unk> <unk> <unk> from other people .
If somebody 's the idea of <unk> all these <unk> <unk> <unk> the name , my picture of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> in that <unk> , using the picture of anyone and have a social <unk> and <unk> .
Of course , a <unk> of all the interesting models of all of the interesting part of the earth , <unk> not just to <unk> <unk> and <unk> images , but from <unk> .
<unk> .
Chris Anderson : I realized good ? What 's your software <unk> to do is that , in the next years , all the photographs , in the next years , all the <unk> <unk> <unk> , all the photographs of the world will be <unk> <unk> , <unk> together ?
<unk> : Yeah . What 's doing is doing in <unk> .
It 's creating <unk> , if you want , in images .
And it 's doing the <unk> of the images .
The thing is very interesting if you think about <unk> information <unk> that many of these images <unk> .
As a <unk> <unk> to the web of images , you <unk> a <unk> and the text on the web has a lot of information about images .
Now , what happens if that picture is going on to all your picture ?
So , the amount of <unk> <unk> and the amount of <unk> that <unk> is really enormous . It 's a <unk> effect . It 's a <unk> effect of the network .
CA : <unk> , it 's really incredible . <unk> .
<unk> : I 'm going to tell you a lot .
One of the main <unk> when you <unk> and one of the <unk> research is the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , <unk> the <unk> <unk> , <unk> the <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> to think that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , or that <unk> <unk> <unk> , or that <unk> <unk> <unk> are still <unk> <unk> <unk> , or <unk> , <unk> , or <unk> , <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> of <unk> , and that the <unk> of <unk> , and that the idea that the <unk> of <unk> , and that the idea that the world in which we live in in which is a sense , but it 's just a <unk> of reality .
the <unk> of a particular <unk> of choices that our <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that our <unk> <unk> did , or bad , many <unk> ago .
And of course , all of the <unk> <unk> .
Everybody <unk> . <unk> .
We 're <unk> to <unk> <unk> .
We have to <unk> the <unk> of death , so we don 't <unk> it and <unk> --
We all have a art .
What 's the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> of the song , the <unk> of <unk> of every culture .
It doesn 't matter that the <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> , or the <unk> of <unk> <unk> , or the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , or a <unk> in <unk> , or a <unk> in the heart of the <unk> .
He was my <unk> of my <unk> <unk> in <unk> a month ago , or a <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of <unk> , <unk> <unk> , on the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> mother of the world .
All of these <unk> <unk> that there are other ways of <unk> other ways of thinking , other ways to move in the world .
And if you could <unk> a moment , it 's a concept that can give you hope .
<unk> , the <unk> <unk> of the world create a <unk> <unk> life and <unk> that <unk> the planet and <unk> <unk> that <unk> the planet and it 's important for the <unk> of the planet , so as the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And you can think of this <unk> <unk> as a <unk> and can <unk> the <unk> of all the <unk> of all the <unk> of all the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> in being from the human imagination .
The <unk> is the <unk> <unk> of humanity .
It 's the <unk> of what we are and what we can be in how <unk> species .
And <unk> the <unk> was <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , for example , <unk> that 50 percent of all the species is or <unk> <unk> of <unk> , just because it 's <unk> , or -- in the <unk> <unk> -- in the <unk> of <unk> diversity -- and you don 't even even <unk> to the <unk> -- that of the <unk> diversity -- and you can 't even even <unk> <unk> <unk> -- that 's <unk> <unk> -- that <unk> diversity .
The <unk> of all is , of course , the <unk> <unk> .
When you 're <unk> <unk> <unk> on this planet .
A language is not just <unk> by a <unk> or a series of rules .
A language is <unk> the human spirit .
It 's the middle of the <unk> that the <unk> of every culture comes in the world .
Every language is a forest of mind , a <unk> , a <unk> thought , a <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
And of those <unk> <unk> , while we 're sitting here in <unk> , at least half the children .
They don 't get <unk> to children , which means , at least that , <unk> <unk> , who don 't <unk> something , which is that they 're already death .
What 's more <unk> of being <unk> <unk> from the <unk> , of being the last to talk a language , of the <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> the <unk> of <unk> or <unk> the <unk> of <unk> <unk> ?
This <unk> <unk> is the state of somebody in a few of the world every two weeks : every two weeks , a <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> with <unk> .
And I know that somebody of you know , " I don 't that ?
The world doesn 't be a better place if we <unk> all the same language ? " <unk> , then we all talk about <unk> .
<unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , what it means to say , he doesn 't talk about their language .
I 'd like to show you a journey through the <unk> --
a little journey in the <unk> to give you a <unk> of what we 're <unk> .
Many of us <unk> that when I say , " different ways of <unk> , " I mean , " I 'm really different ways of <unk> .
<unk> for example , this <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , which <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
It 's a <unk> that 's not able to <unk> the blue color from the green because the <unk> is <unk> in the time of the forest , which <unk> <unk> .
They have a <unk> language and a <unk> rule , <unk> " <unk> <unk> " : you have to <unk> a person who talks about a different language .
And all <unk> in the past <unk> , <unk> is that in these families <unk> <unk> in which they talk six or seven <unk> because of the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
It 's going to listen and then <unk> to talk .
I 'm going to <unk> one of the most interesting <unk> that I lived , the <unk> of <unk> <unk> , a incredible <unk> that had the first <unk> in <unk> .
In <unk> five <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
They did <unk> from the top of photographs that <unk> them in <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> that this <unk> forest <unk> <unk> had never seen anything .
They <unk> the picture of the <unk> , they <unk> the <unk> of a form or a <unk> , not <unk> , they <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> , and they <unk> the five <unk> with <unk> .
But <unk> not just to <unk> the <unk> .
They <unk> in their own .
<unk> percent of the <unk> <unk> was <unk> by their own .
We 're <unk> to eight <unk> and we found two <unk> <unk> and when we <unk> to know , they <unk> that one of them was <unk> so that it died , and then they <unk> it . And then they <unk> it . They <unk> it . And then they <unk> it .
The <unk> were able to recognize the animal <unk> from 40 <unk> and <unk> the species .
<unk> <unk> , I was <unk> a very interesting task when my <unk> <unk> , I was a very interesting task when my <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> .
For a sense of <unk> , I should understand the <unk> culture and that <unk> is not <unk> <unk> .
It 's quite a <unk> <unk> <unk> of the world .
Very interesting .
If you <unk> to <unk> the big <unk> of the world , what would you do ?
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , etc .
A continent comes back to the thinking about Africa <unk> doesn 't have <unk> <unk> . And instead , and the <unk> is not another that the <unk> of these <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
What makes the <unk> of <unk> is the <unk> of life and death .
So the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> can be <unk> by the <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> in the way that for a short moment , <unk> <unk> .
So , the <unk> <unk> <unk> , " <unk> <unk> <unk> . "
We <unk> in <unk> and <unk> God . "
And from the moment that you 're <unk> , is the spirit that <unk> you can you do <unk> ?
So , they <unk> to these incredible events : <unk> <unk> in <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> of power <unk> in the body when it 's <unk> in a state of <unk> <unk> .
<unk> all the <unk> <unk> that I lived the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , in the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that once once <unk> on the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> on the <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> on the <unk> .
In a <unk> continent of blood , this <unk> is never <unk> by <unk> .
<unk> <unk> today are <unk> by a <unk> , but their education is <unk> .
The young young <unk> are <unk> from families or four years , and they live <unk> in a world <unk> and <unk> in a world <unk> <unk> <unk> for 18 years .
Two <unk> years old <unk> of nine years <unk> of <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of the mother , now are <unk> in the <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
For all this time , they 're <unk> to values that <unk> their society , values that they <unk> that their <unk> and only <unk> their <unk> <unk> <unk> -- or to say the <unk> <unk> .
At the <unk> of this incredible <unk> , they <unk> <unk> out and for the first time in their life , at age of 18 years , they see a <unk> . And that moment of <unk> <unk> , when the sun <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , all of <unk> , all that , all that they have been <unk> in the <unk> , all of <unk> , all that they 're <unk> up in the <unk> .
" <unk> ? I 'm going to do it as I said .
It 's <unk> . Now it 's <unk> . "
They 're called <unk> <unk> and they say that , <unk> <unk> , we are the <unk> of the world .
This level of <unk> is extremely important .
When we think of <unk> <unk> and the environment <unk> <unk> and the old story of <unk> <unk> <unk> , which is a <unk> concept in his <unk> or maybe <unk> <unk> <unk> and say that these <unk> are <unk> <unk> to Earth .
<unk> <unk> are not <unk> or <unk> <unk> from the <unk> .
There 's not space for these things in the <unk> <unk> of <unk> or <unk> in the <unk> <unk> , but because of time and <unk> , they 've created a <unk> of Earth <unk> , they 've created a <unk> <unk> of the <unk> , the concept that the Earth can live because it 's <unk> by the concept of human <unk> .
What does that mean ?
It means that a <unk> of <unk> that <unk> the mountain is a <unk> spirit that <unk> the mountain is a <unk> <unk> that <unk> its <unk> will be a different human <unk> and will have a different <unk> with the mountain or that <unk> that <unk> that a mountain , which is a <unk> <unk> <unk> that a mountain , and <unk> <unk> .
which is the <unk> of a spirit or a <unk> <unk> is <unk> .
What 's interesting is the <unk> that <unk> the <unk> between the <unk> and the natural world .
I grew up in the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> to be <unk> .
And that <unk> me a human being different from my friends who believe that <unk> are the <unk> of <unk> and the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> that live in the <unk> <unk> <unk> , who live in the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
If we started <unk> that these <unk> can actually create different , they could start understanding some of their <unk> <unk> . We could start to understand some of them <unk> .
I <unk> this picture of <unk> in <unk> <unk> .
Maybe some of you have heard about the <unk> , the most powerful <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
What makes the <unk> is not the potential <unk> potential of the <unk> , but his <unk> <unk> . It 's <unk> by two elements .
<unk> one side , this <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> a series of <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
<unk> the only <unk> <unk> <unk> a little <unk> that <unk> a little bit of the <unk> , but it 's <unk> with the <unk> of a <unk> of the family <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
This <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , very similar to <unk> , <unk> .
If you 'll see the <unk> <unk> on the <unk> of the <unk> that they do from a different <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> that <unk> on the <unk> is a little bit like being <unk> by a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> on a sea <unk> of electricity . <unk> doesn 't create a <unk> <unk> of electricity . It doesn 't create a <unk> <unk> of the reality .
<unk> <unk> , <unk> with my <unk> , Richard <unk> <unk> , the man who <unk> <unk> <unk> was <unk> , with his discovery of <unk> <unk> <unk> in the ' <unk> .
My <unk> is not <unk> these <unk> as <unk> because if you 're doing , you can 't tell anybody to be <unk> . <unk> <unk> . <unk> 't you can 't be <unk> because they 're <unk> from a <unk> that <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
It 's possible to <unk> <unk> , if we could <unk> with other <unk> <unk> that <unk> .
Now , the <unk> <unk> : the <unk> that are in this <unk> are <unk> of <unk> , the same kind of <unk> to <unk> the <unk> . The question <unk> <unk> : in a <unk> <unk> species of plants , like these <unk> to <unk> two <unk> , not like that , but that if you think , in this , they create a <unk> version of the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> ?
We use the big <unk> of <unk> and <unk> , which can <unk> .
But if we <unk> to <unk> , " <unk> " <unk> plants . "
What does that mean ?
This <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , which <unk> <unk> in the forest , and that <unk> <unk> in the forest , and that our eyes <unk> in the same species .
If you <unk> how to <unk> their <unk> , " <unk> <unk> <unk> , " <unk> <unk> <unk> of plants , the rest of you know ? " I said , " No . "
The solution is : they take the <unk> <unk> in a night , <unk> <unk> <unk> with a different <unk> .
And with this doesn 't <unk> us to <unk> , but it 's much more interesting than <unk> <unk> .
Now , [ <unk> ] the problem is that even those of us who have to the heart <unk> <unk> them , but in a way to <unk> to the <unk> of the story of the <unk> of the story of the real world , and over .
In fact , the <unk> century , in 300 years , not <unk> <unk> for his <unk> or <unk> <unk> <unk> , but rather as the was where we <unk> and <unk> <unk> , or <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of diversity and <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> the <unk> of diversity . Now , the problem is not the change .
All the <unk> through the <unk> <unk> have been <unk> in a new <unk> <unk> of <unk> .
And the problem is not the technology .
<unk> <unk> don 't have <unk> to be <unk> when they <unk> <unk> and <unk> as the <unk> <unk> have <unk> <unk> <unk> when they <unk> <unk> <unk> .
It 's not the change or the technology that <unk> the <unk> of <unk> . It 's the power .
The <unk> <unk> of <unk> .
And if you look at a world , <unk> that these are not <unk> <unk> <unk> .
They 're <unk> creatures and <unk> <unk> out of the <unk> forces that go beyond their <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of <unk> --
a <unk> <unk> <unk> , in <unk> <unk> , a <unk> that <unk> in the forest to a generation , and now <unk> to the <unk> <unk> <unk> , where you can see the <unk> <unk> <unk> , where you can see the river <unk> <unk> , where it looks at the <unk> <unk> , where the <unk> <unk> <unk> , where the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , where the <unk> <unk> , where the <unk> <unk> <unk> ,
We <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> to the forest .
Or , in the case of <unk> , are the disease that are <unk> with the <unk> discovery of <unk> .
If we <unk> on the <unk> of the <unk> , where I 'm doing a lot of research , you 'll see the <unk> <unk> of the political <unk> .
As <unk> the <unk> , the physics of a <unk> , is <unk> at the <unk> level , but the <unk> , the <unk> of <unk> life of a <unk> , not just <unk> , but <unk> <unk> in certain <unk> , because it 's part of <unk> .
And you can 't understand the <unk> of the <unk> until you can 't understand the beginning .
I <unk> the <unk> miles from <unk> in China through the <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> to <unk> with a young <unk> , but only <unk> to <unk> . I was <unk> to <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> million people <unk> from <unk> during the <unk> <unk> .
The father of this guy was <unk> to <unk> <unk> .
which means that it 's been <unk> at the time of the Chinese <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> in <unk> , which <unk> <unk> <unk> .
My mother was <unk> and his <unk> was <unk> .
It 's <unk> <unk> in <unk> at age two years , <unk> under his <unk> <unk> because he couldn 't have a <unk> .
The <unk> , who did the same , was <unk> in <unk> .
A day he <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> and , for this <unk> , was <unk> to <unk> <unk> for seven years .
The pain of <unk> can be <unk> , but the spirit of the <unk> of <unk> is <unk> .
And then , all they <unk> to a choice .
Do you have to live in the world of <unk> or we want to <unk> the world of diversity ?
The great <unk> <unk> <unk> , before he said that his greatest <unk> was that his greatest fear was that , in our <unk> <unk> <unk> of the world , not just <unk> the whole <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the human imagination , but a day , we <unk> that there were other possibilities .
And it 's <unk> to remember that our species is <unk> for <unk> years .
The <unk> <unk> , who <unk> us , which <unk> us to <unk> <unk> , <unk> the <unk> of <unk> <unk> , <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , and we talk about <unk> years ago .
The <unk> world <unk> <unk> 300 years .
And that <unk> story , I didn 't think we have the answers to all the <unk> to <unk> in <unk> .
When we <unk> <unk> <unk> of the world is asked what it means to say to be human , <unk> with <unk> <unk> .
And it 's in these answers that we all <unk> the opportunity to be what we are : a kind of <unk> , which has to <unk> that all the <unk> and <unk> . And there are great moments of <unk> .
I <unk> this picture on the <unk> <unk> of the island of <unk> , when I went to <unk> <unk> with <unk> , and this man , <unk> me , and this man , <unk> me .
The government <unk> is not always <unk> with the <unk> <unk> <unk> and in the <unk> <unk> , we <unk> them in <unk> .
The <unk> of this man <unk> <unk> .
The family , <unk> for his life , <unk> <unk> all the <unk> , and all his <unk> .
You know , you know , <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> <unk> were made of <unk> fish <unk> in <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> of this man doesn 't <unk> <unk> from the night or <unk> <unk> .
It 's <unk> on , it 's <unk> the <unk> in <unk> <unk> and <unk> in his hand . When I did it , he <unk> it , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
He <unk> <unk> on the <unk> of this <unk> <unk> , and when <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> a dog .
He <unk> the dog and created a <unk> , with the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Do you want to talk about <unk> ? [ <unk> ] ] . And that , in different ways , [ <unk> ] is the <unk> of <unk> <unk> and all the <unk> <unk> of the world .
<unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> government <unk> <unk> to <unk> the <unk> of a <unk> area of <unk> <unk> <unk> of California and <unk> <unk> .
It 's their new <unk> . It 's called <unk> .
It 's a <unk> <unk> . <unk> all the <unk> resources .
One <unk> example of how a <unk> can <unk> with his <unk> .
And , to end , I think it 's pretty <unk> at least who 's been in these <unk> <unk> <unk> of the planet , <unk> that they realize that they 're not going to be <unk> .
For somebody 's home .
<unk> <unk> of the human imagination that <unk> to <unk> of the time . And for us all , the dreams of these children , as the dreams of our children , become part of <unk> hope .
For us , we <unk> <unk> <unk> , we <unk> <unk> that <unk> never <unk> .
<unk> <unk> --
<unk> <unk> , they don 't think about it , but we believe that stories can change the world , and maybe we are the best <unk> to tell the stories of the world . Every month , our website <unk> <unk> million <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> our <unk> <unk> .
Our <unk> are <unk> of people .
Our work is <unk> in <unk> to bring our public places to <unk> <unk> from which <unk> <unk> from which <unk> <unk> from how they <unk> <unk> and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> : the world 's <unk> in diversity , and we have to find a <unk> of life in a world , and we need to find a <unk> <unk> , and we need to find a <unk> world .
where the <unk> of all the <unk> can <unk> our <unk> <unk> .
Thank you .
I 'm going to talk about some of the things that I wrote in this book that I hope that I 've heard and <unk> a few <unk> , in case , in the case , you don 't know .
I 'd like to start with what I call " the <unk> <unk> . "
What do you know ?
The <unk> <unk> of all the society <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> : " If we want to <unk> the <unk> of our citizens " <unk> " <unk> for it is <unk> . "
The reason is , from one side , in fact that the freedom is in itself a value , it 's <unk> , <unk> <unk> for human beings .
<unk> another one is in fact that if we 're <unk> , each of us can do everything that we <unk> our <unk> , without no one that <unk> in our <unk> , without no one who <unk> in our own .
The way to <unk> the freedom is <unk> to <unk> the choice .
<unk> people have , more <unk> , and more and more is their freedom , more than the freedom , is their <unk> .
This , <unk> , it 's so <unk> <unk> in society that nobody <unk> <unk> in <unk> .
And it 's also <unk> <unk> in our lives .
I 'm going to show you some examples of what the progress has <unk> .
This is my <unk> . It 's not particularly big .
I was a simple <unk> on the <unk> to <unk> .
In my <unk> , there 's <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> the 10 <unk> of <unk> <unk> and the 12 <unk> <unk> that you can buy for a huge number of <unk> <unk> that nobody of <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> that no one of the <unk> of your <unk> .
So , that 's what <unk> .
Then you go to the <unk> store for buy a <unk> : <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
And in this single <unk> store , there 's a big number of <unk> <unk> .
We can do six million <unk> <unk> using the <unk> that there are in a <unk> store .
<unk> <unk> that there is <unk> choice .
<unk> <unk> <unk> : The world of <unk> .
Once , when I was a child , you could get all the services <unk> <unk> , <unk> that were <unk> by <unk> <unk> .
It 's going to <unk> the phone , you can 't <unk> .
A <unk> of that , between the other , was that the phone never <unk> .
These days they went .
We 've got a <unk> <unk> almost <unk> <unk> , especially in the cell phones .
So , that 's the <unk> cell phones .
My <unk> is that in a half , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
If you don 't have the store in the store under the store , you 're very <unk> that soon .
And what 's going on to end is that people <unk> in <unk> and <unk> this question . And you know , is the answer ? The answer is " No . "
It 's not possible to buy a phone that doesn 't face .
So , in other <unk> of life that are much more important than the <unk> , <unk> the same <unk> of choices .
<unk> <unk> : It doesn 't happen in the United States that you 're <unk> and <unk> you will <unk> you have to do .
Instead , <unk> from the <unk> , and the <unk> says , " OK , " Well , could we do it , or <unk> " <unk> " <unk> " <unk> , " <unk> , " <unk> , " <unk> these <unk> and these <unk> . What do you want to do ? "
You <unk> : " <unk> , what do ? "
And the <unk> says , " <unk> , " he <unk> these <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> . "
" What do you want to do ? "
And you would say , " <unk> if she was me , what would you do ? "
And the <unk> : " But I 'm not she . "
The result we call it " <unk> " <unk> " , " <unk> " <unk> " <unk> " , " <unk> " <unk> " <unk> " , " <unk> " <unk> " , " <unk> " <unk> " , " <unk> " <unk> " , " <unk> " <unk> " <unk> " , " <unk> " <unk> " , " <unk> " <unk> " , " <unk> " <unk> " , " <unk> " <unk> " , " <unk> " <unk>
But actually it 's not that one <unk> the weight and the responsibility of <unk> to make decisions that something , <unk> the <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and so that in <unk> to take it to take the patient .
There 's a huge <unk> of products , <unk> to people like me and you , that if you think about it has no sense , because we can 't <unk> .
But if we can 't we <unk> them ?
The answer is that they want to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> of how fundamental as a <unk> is our <unk> <unk> , as you see in this <unk> , " <unk> , " We don 't want to <unk> children . <unk> their sex at the time . " Don 't want to <unk> . " We need to <unk> . " We need to <unk> . " We need to <unk> . " We need to <unk> . " We don 't want to <unk> .
And we can <unk> how many times we <unk> .
And the <unk> that means that every <unk> , you have to decide that kind of person , you have to decide that kind of person .
<unk> to the family and <unk> , a <unk> <unk> , <unk> almost for anyone , was that there was <unk> the <unk> as possible , and you could <unk> to children the <unk> as soon as possible .
The only real choice was with who , not when , and they don 't even even what to do after .
<unk> , all is really really to play .
<unk> to students very smart students , and they <unk> them the 20 percent less than a time .
And not because they 're less <unk> , because they 're not less <unk> .
But why do I <unk> , <unk> <unk> , " <unk> <unk> <unk> or not ? "
" <unk> <unk> <unk> later ? I have to think about children or the career ? "
They 're <unk> <unk> .
And they try to answer these questions , even though this <unk> , even though , I don 't <unk> the <unk> that <unk> and not to get a <unk> <unk> to my <unk> .
And they have to do that . They 're important questions .
Now , the work : we 're <unk> , like <unk> <unk> , because the technology allows us to work every day , every day , from every day , <unk> <unk> that from the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , there 's a <unk> , and I 'm not going to say , where the <unk> works .
I don 't tell you , because I want to use it .
What does , this incredible freedom to choice that we have about the work ? Is that we have to <unk> , <unk> at every time , if we have to work or not .
We can go to see our son to <unk> , with the phone in a <unk> , the <unk> in the other , and the <unk> , <unk> .
And even though I 'm all <unk> , every minute that we see our son , we are also <unk> , " I have to answer this called ? "
" I have to answer this <unk> ? I have to <unk> this letter ? "
And even when the answer is " no , " that makes the experience of your son very very different than what it would be in other conditions .
So , from any part of them , little and small things , and <unk> materials and <unk> and <unk> life is a question of choices .
Once the world was this : <unk> , there were some possibilities , but it was a few possibilities , but it was a question of choice .
The world of today , <unk> is , " <unk> is , " Is it a <unk> thing , or <unk> ? "
The answer is <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> <unk> them all , so I 'm going to talk about the <unk> .
<unk> this choice <unk> two effects of people .
The first one , <unk> , is that it <unk> instead of <unk> .
And so many <unk> in which is very difficult to do it .
I 'll give you a <unk> <unk> : a study <unk> <unk> <unk> .
A <unk> <unk> to the data of <unk> , the <unk> society of <unk> <unk> , with about a million <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> .
What she found was that for every 10 solutions that are <unk> in the <unk> <unk> <unk> of two percent .
With 50 <unk> <unk> , there 's 10 percent in less than when they 're available , they 're <unk> . Why ?
because with 50 <unk> <unk> in which one one <unk> , is to decide , and the choice is <unk> to <unk> .
And <unk> , and again , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and of course , <unk> , and of course , <unk> <unk> , and of course , <unk> , and of course , <unk> , <unk> , and of course , <unk> , <unk> , and of course , <unk> , <unk> , and of course , <unk> , <unk> , and of course , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and of course , and of course , and of course , <unk> , and of course , <unk> , and of
<unk> that doesn 't mean that these <unk> <unk> <unk> food to <unk> because they don 't want enough money , it wants to say that the decision is so <unk> that they 're also going to <unk> the <unk> of work .
They 're not <unk> , they 're <unk> to five <unk> <unk> for year <unk> , which would be <unk> .
So the <unk> is a <unk> of <unk> choices .
And I think that 's going to <unk> the world .
" And to end , <unk> : <unk> , <unk> or <unk> ? "
You could just take the right decision , if it 's the <unk> , right ?
You don 't want to choose the wrong , and you 'll <unk> the wrong .
So this is the first effect . The second is that even if we can <unk> <unk> <unk> and make a choice , at the end , we are less <unk> by the <unk> of how to <unk> <unk> .
And that 's for different reasons .
One of these is that with many <unk> in which one one and not is perfect , it 's not perfect , it 's easy to imagine that that I could do a different choice that was better . And that that 's that <unk> <unk> us to <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> of choice , and the <unk> <unk> <unk> ,
And it was a decision .
<unk> choices , there are , <unk> , <unk> is easier to <unk> than it is <unk> of <unk> choice .
<unk> , there 's what <unk> call <unk> .
Dan <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> very well as the value that we give things to <unk> from what we <unk> .
<unk> , when there are a lot of <unk> , is easy to <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> and be less <unk> <unk> of <unk> that <unk> is choice .
Here 's a example . I 'm going to <unk> with all the ones that are not in New York .
But that 's what you probably <unk> .
There 's this <unk> to <unk> .
A place of <unk> .
<unk> <unk> . It 's all about it .
It doesn 't <unk> . But what he thinks is , " Well , <unk> , it 's <unk> . "
" All my <unk> to <unk> . "
" <unk> <unk> <unk> right ? "
And it 's two weeks , I 'm going to <unk> -- every day -- the <unk> <unk> <unk> where it wants .
The <unk> <unk> <unk> for what we have , even when the choice was <unk> .
And the <unk> <unk> that we have from <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> us against how to <unk> .
Here 's another example .
This <unk> tells us a lot of things .
We talk about the time , and maybe in the time , and maybe in slowly .
But the most important point is that anything you <unk> , you 're <unk> to do other .
The things that we don 't have a lot of <unk> that can make less <unk> what we do .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> <unk> .
I tried it on my skin <unk> a new couple of <unk> .
It 's <unk> almost always <unk> .
Once the <unk> were a kind of <unk> , they <unk> them and <unk> , they were <unk> , only after <unk> , they were <unk> , just after <unk> a lot of <unk> , and <unk> <unk> a lot of times , <unk> to go .
So , I was going to <unk> a couple of when the <unk> were gone , and I said , " I need a couple of <unk> , this is my <unk> . "
<unk> <unk> said , " You want to <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> ? "
Do you want to <unk> them ? " <unk> " <unk> " or " <unk> " or " <unk> " ? "
" " <unk> <unk> ? "
" <unk> <unk> <unk> them , or <unk> ? <unk> <unk> <unk> .
I was <unk> , and after a little bit I could say , " I want to say , " I want to the one one , " I want to be , " I 'm <unk> , " I 'm going to <unk> , <unk> from the store , <unk> , <unk> from the store , <unk> that I had ever had .
It was the <unk> . With all that choice I <unk> the best .
But I 'm worse .
Why ? I wrote a whole book for <unk> .
The reason I was worse is that with all my <unk> were <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
I was <unk> <unk> . I didn 't <unk> anything to <unk> when I just <unk> it , just a kind , but when we had to <unk> 100 different , at least one had to be perfect .
What I was <unk> was good , but not perfect .
After I had to <unk> that I was <unk> in <unk> .
The <unk> of <unk> in the life of people don 't do that <unk> the <unk> of the same <unk> .
And this is less <unk> , even when the results are good .
<unk> in the world of the <unk> <unk> if it 's <unk> .
because if I <unk> it , I 'm not talking about what I 'm talking about .
The truth is more to this .
" It was better when he was worse , " The reason why he was <unk> when he was worse is that when he was worse was , when he was <unk> as a <unk> <unk> .
<unk> , in the world that we live -- <unk> , <unk> citizens with the <unk> of <unk> -- the <unk> that we can <unk> is that things are at the <unk> <unk> .
You 've never never ever <unk> because your <unk> , my <unk> , <unk> .
The <unk> of happiness -- what you 're here -- is , " <unk> <unk> " Yes , " You want to . "
I mean , little moment -- I 'm really <unk> -- that I 'm really <unk> and my wife is really <unk> .
I couldn 't do better , I couldn 't do it .
But <unk> , it 's not a <unk> thing .
<unk> , a <unk> of buy a couple of <unk> <unk> when there 's just that kind of <unk> is that when you 're not <unk> , and I 'll you say , " Why ? "
" Who is <unk> ? " <unk> is <unk> .
The world is the <unk> . What can I do ?
When there are hundreds of <unk> , and you 'll <unk> them , and you 'll <unk> them who is the <unk> , it 's clear that the <unk> is <unk> that the <unk> you .
We could do better .
And with hundreds of <unk> available , there 's no <unk> to <unk> .
So when people <unk> decisions , even though the <unk> is <unk> , they <unk> <unk> and <unk> their own own .
In the last years , the <unk> <unk> in the world .
I think a <unk> <unk> -- not the only , but important -- of this <unk> <unk> of <unk> is that people have <unk> experiences because the standard are too <unk> .
And when they have to <unk> this situation that the <unk> is they .
So the final result is that in general , we 're better , <unk> , but we 'll <unk> it .
Let me show you .
This is the <unk> <unk> , what we all do for good and it 's completely <unk> . It 's not true .
There 's no <unk> that a little bit of choice is better than not to <unk> , but not <unk> that a lot of choice is better than a little bit .
There 's a <unk> value , <unk> . I don 't know what it 's .
But I 'm sure we 've <unk> from a piece of the level where the choices <unk> our life .
Now , from the <unk> <unk> -- I 'm almost almost finished -- I 'm almost <unk> -- from the <unk> <unk> .
What it allows all this choice in society <unk> is the <unk> material .
There are a lot of places in the world , and you know , <unk> <unk> , where the problem is that they have <unk> .
The problem is that they have too <unk> .
So the <unk> <unk> that I 'm talking about is a <unk> <unk> of <unk> , <unk> society .
And what <unk> <unk> and <unk> is this : <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> about how <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . It 's a <unk> <unk> of money .
I mean that these choices , <unk> and <unk> , it 's not that they 're just <unk> .
They 're <unk> <unk> .
They do it worse .
If a little bit of what in our society allows <unk> to <unk> choice was <unk> in those people who have too few people , it would not be their life to <unk> . but also our own life .
This is what <unk> call a <unk> <unk> .
A <unk> of income income <unk> to everybody -- not just to the poor people -- because of this choice in <unk> that we <unk> .
So , " <unk> , you can get all that you want to be everything you want to do . "
<unk> , people of culture , <unk> : " What do you know ? "
" It 's <unk> that you can 't do anything in a glass <unk> . "
" A <unk> imagination , a <unk> <unk> of the world -- "
and I <unk> it , I <unk> it , at the beginning .
But then , <unk> , I realized that that that fish knows that that fish knows the long .
because the reality of <unk> is that if you <unk> the <unk> , so that , " is that if you can 't <unk> the freedom . It 's <unk> . It 's <unk> . It 's <unk> .
If we could <unk> the <unk> that everything we could <unk> the <unk> .
<unk> the <unk> , and <unk> the <unk> of <unk> .
<unk> <unk> .
This is almost of course too <unk> , maybe for the fish , and it 's certainly for us .
But the <unk> of some <unk> <unk> is a <unk> for <unk> and <unk> , <unk> , for <unk> .
Thank you very much .
