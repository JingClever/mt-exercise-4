<unk> year I showed these <unk> for <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> , which for almost three million years had the size of the United States <unk> , <unk> is <unk> percent .
So , this <unk> <unk> the <unk> of the problem because it 's not <unk> the ice <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> is , in a sense , the heart <unk> of climate system .
You <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
The next <unk> is going to be a <unk> <unk> on the last 25 years .
<unk> <unk> are <unk> in red .
As you see , you 're going to go down to the blue <unk> .
That 's the ice in <unk> , which <unk> in summer .
You can see that the ice <unk> <unk> , of five years or <unk> , is like blood blood , which here <unk> from the body .
In 25 years , it 's been <unk> .
This is a problem because the <unk> <unk> around the ocean <unk> where there are huge <unk> of <unk> that , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> are <unk> in <unk> .
<unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> from global <unk> , that amount of <unk> , <unk> this point of not <unk> .
In some <unk> <unk> , in <unk> the <unk> is already <unk> by water .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> last <unk> <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> ! <unk> : <unk> . She 's good . The question is if we <unk> it .
A reason is that this <unk> <unk> <unk> from the north .
This is a <unk> river to <unk> <unk> .
<unk> had never <unk> <unk> .
This is the <unk> river , in the <unk> of the <unk> .
If you want to know how the <unk> <unk> <unk> on the <unk> <unk> , here is where the sea .
These <unk> are <unk> .
<unk> other part of the planet : <unk> , the largest <unk> of ice on the planet .
<unk> last month , scientists have <unk> that the <unk> of ice is in <unk> , and that the <unk> <unk> , which <unk> on some <unk> <unk> , is particularly <unk> in <unk> .
<unk> <unk> feet of the <unk> , like <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , the third largest <unk> of ice , you see new <unk> , that a few years ago were <unk> .
<unk> percent of the world 's population <unk> water from that <unk> .
<unk> <unk> : this <unk> is the source of water <unk> of this city .
<unk> is <unk> .
But when you get it , the same happens to the water .
In California , <unk> on the <unk> <unk> is <unk> percent .
<unk> <unk> are in the crisis .
<unk> , as you read , they 're <unk> .
<unk> <unk> in the world <unk> to a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> are <unk> to a <unk> out of the normal and without <unk> .
<unk> times over the last 30 years than <unk> <unk> .
This is a <unk> of <unk> .
If you look at it in the context that you can see the <unk> .
In the last five years , we 've <unk> 70 million <unk> of CO2 every 24 hours -- 25 million <unk> in the oceans every day .
Look at the <unk> area , from the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and on both parts of the <unk> , where there 's a <unk> <unk> <unk> of oxygen in the oceans .
The <unk> <unk> because of global warming , together to <unk> , which is 20 percent , is the use of <unk> .
<unk> is a problem , and <unk> is even worse .
The United States is one of the two countries with <unk> <unk> , together .
And they 're going to build a lot of other <unk> .
But we 're <unk> to a <unk> of direction .
These are the <unk> projects in the last few years and some <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
<unk> , there is a <unk> politics in our country .
<unk> and <unk> have <unk> <unk> million dollars in the last year to <unk> <unk> <unk> , which is a <unk> .
<unk> picture me , something --
<unk> <unk> , in the <unk> , where I live , there was a <unk> of <unk> billion <unk> of <unk> .
Maybe you saw it on the <unk> .
This is the second largest <unk> <unk> in America .
It 's happened around <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> was this .
<unk> : <unk> ♫ ♫ ♫ <unk> the <unk> is a kind of <unk> and happy .
It 's <unk> here in America , and <unk> our economy .
<unk> the <unk> is more <unk> .
It 's <unk> , <unk> and <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> here is a lot of <unk> <unk> .
The largest society <unk> society on the <unk> is <unk> . This is his <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> : <unk> -- Al <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> -- not know what they 're talking about .
<unk> : So the <unk> for the <unk> <unk> has <unk> two <unk> .
This is one of them , a part .
<unk> : <unk> : <unk> , we see <unk> change as a <unk> <unk> <unk> to our business .
So , for that our <unk> is <unk> a big amount of money in a <unk> <unk> to make public and <unk> the truth on <unk> .
In fact , <unk> is not <unk> .
We think it 's <unk> -- it 's also a good <unk> .
So we don 't have to <unk> .
We 're going to do .
<unk> : <unk> : <unk> <unk> -- you 've heard about it very much .
So I 'm going to take a <unk> <unk> for how it is <unk> .
<unk> ! <unk> are a little bit <unk> , but this is the sound of <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> is between the main <unk> of global <unk> , but the <unk> technology <unk> that you see it changes everything .
You see a look at this , this is the <unk> technology .
<unk> : <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to the economic <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> : <unk> is in the economy , the national security , the <unk> crisis .
The <unk> that <unk> all of our <unk> from the <unk> <unk> , like <unk> and oil <unk> .
Now , but there 's a new , <unk> solution to <unk> .
<unk> America : 100 percent of <unk> energy , in 10 years .
A plan to <unk> America at work , <unk> more <unk> , and help <unk> the global <unk> .
<unk> , a solution that we could solve our problems .
<unk> America . <unk> than <unk> .
<unk> : This is the last one .
<unk> : <unk> : It 's <unk> of energy to America .
One of the <unk> ways of the <unk> <unk> that <unk> our planet .
<unk> : The future is here . <unk> , a new network network .
<unk> <unk> two : <unk> <unk> for work .
<unk> : <unk> America . It 's time to be <unk> .
<unk> : A old <unk> <unk> says , " If you want to go to <unk> , go from alone .
If you want to go away , you go to the <unk> , you go together . "
We have to go away , quickly .
Thank you very much .
<unk> year , I made a <unk> on the <unk> .
And I 'm going to <unk> to <unk> on how it works .
So I 'm going to go . And for those that the other time , the <unk> is the largest scientific <unk> experiment ever -- <unk> miles of <unk> .
<unk> is to <unk> the conditions that were in the <unk> of the <unk> of the universe -- until <unk> million times at the beginning of the universe -- until <unk> million times at the second .
All that 's just <unk> .
This is the machine under <unk> .
<unk> these <unk> <unk> inside the <unk> .
This is what I work . It 's called <unk> -- <unk> feet and has a <unk> <unk> feet .
This is an <unk> picture of <unk> in building so you can see the <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> last year we <unk> the machine for the first time .
And this picture was <unk> by <unk> .
It was <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> .
It 's an image of the first <unk> of particles that had all been around the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , with a part of the <unk> , and <unk> particles inside the <unk> .
In other words , when I <unk> that picture the 10 <unk> , <unk> that the machine , the machine that 's a big <unk> .
I don 't know if it was this to do it was going to take us to do it .
What it means we had a <unk> impact over to that scientific impact .
<unk> a week later , there was a problem with the machine , we had to these <unk> here -- these <unk> <unk> .
These <unk> <unk> <unk> when the machine works at the <unk> of the <unk> .
Now , the <unk> between you to <unk> the <unk> and <unk> , " It 's not true . They 're too <unk> . "
And they can do it because when they 're very <unk> <unk> <unk> .
So at least <unk> degrees , at a temperature temperature <unk> to that <unk> of the space of the stars , these <unk> can bring that <unk> .
In one of the <unk> between the <unk> of <unk> <unk> in the <unk> , there was a <unk> <unk> of <unk> .
So the <unk> <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
This was the result .
Now , this is even more <unk> if you think that these <unk> <unk> <unk> , and that <unk> of about 30 <unk> <unk> .
They 're <unk> about 50 <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , what we did .
We have <unk> and <unk> .
Now , they 're all going to go to their <unk> place .
<unk> the end of <unk> the <unk> will be <unk> again .
<unk> it , and we <unk> us to get <unk> data or <unk> , and <unk> , and continue so our <unk> to find out what the <unk> are the universe .
Now , of course , in some way , these <unk> <unk> the <unk> value of science and engineering engineering engineering <unk> . And it 's easy to <unk> .
I think the fact that the fact that 's so difficult , the fact of the <unk> , I think that is the value of things like <unk> .
I want to end with the words of a <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , which , <unk> , in <unk> experiments of <unk> experiments , his <unk> was Michael <unk> , he said , " No is <unk> for the <unk> of the human mind of the mind of the human mind <unk> that ideas that ideas of science is <unk> , which our <unk> are not <unk> , and <unk> <unk> ,
Thank you .
I want to start <unk> to <unk> when , from children , <unk> , <unk> with <unk> .
As <unk> as <unk> and <unk> and <unk> , <unk> and <unk> and <unk> , actually to think and solve problems <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> is <unk> <unk> to the way we <unk> <unk> to the world around us .
So , from <unk> <unk> from the <unk> of our <unk> with <unk> objects , and my <unk> <unk> , and my <unk> <unk> <unk> , and my <unk> <unk> , I started to <unk> , " And if we use a computer , instead of having the only <unk> of the <unk> <unk> as a digital <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , that <unk> <unk> <unk>
and <unk> to our <unk> ?
The question was so interesting that we were trying to explore the answer , building .
In a few words , a <unk> , a <unk> computer as a <unk> .
In a few words , a <unk> , a <unk> computer as a <unk> .
You can <unk> them with the hand , they can be <unk> . " <unk> " between them , " <unk> " between them , and they have a <unk> and a <unk> <unk> .
But <unk> , they 're <unk> , like <unk> , you can just <unk> <unk> .
<unk> are the example of a new <unk> of tools for <unk> information .
And as they become more <unk> , <unk> of the <unk> of the movement , of the other , and <unk> as they become more <unk> , <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> , of how we can explore new and <unk> <unk> .
<unk> with some simple example .
This <unk> is <unk> to show up video : if you <unk> it into a direction , the video <unk> , if you <unk> from the other side .
These <unk> are <unk> of the other .
If you <unk> them , you 're going to be what they 're going to around .
If they 're <unk> , and they can <unk> it a little bit .
If they 're <unk> , and they can <unk> it a little bit .
They also <unk> their movement and <unk> .
We then realized that one of the interesting <unk> of the <unk> was that we can use common <unk> on data , to example , " <unk> a color like if it was a <unk> .
In this case , we have three <unk> <unk> as <unk> <unk> and I can <unk> to <unk> <unk> and <unk> for <unk> of color in the central one where you 're <unk> .
and I can <unk> it for <unk> of color in the central color , where you 're <unk> .
If you get too , we can <unk> a little bit of place .
I 'm also <unk> you to <unk> , like <unk> , the <unk> , the math and <unk> where people can try and <unk> the results where people can try and <unk> the results .
Now I 'm --
This is a <unk> sequence of <unk> that I do with a <unk> program .
Here we have a <unk> of words that is in <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> , at every <unk> <unk> a letter to each <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> a letter to any <unk> , and while I <unk> <unk> , and while I <unk> of <unk> , he was <unk> <unk> .
Then , after about 30 seconds , you <unk> , and you have a new <unk> of <unk> and new possibilities to try .
Thank you .
So here , the children <unk> in <unk> <unk> , I did in the <unk> <unk> , I made them a video .
They 're very <unk> .
And one of the interesting things of this kind of <unk> is that you don 't have to give people a lot of <unk> .
I just say , " <unk> of the words , " and they know what to do .
So here 's other people who <unk> it .
This is our <unk> <unk> <unk> , and there on the right .
It wanted to just <unk> .
They were just <unk> , for him .
Now , this is a <unk> of a <unk> <unk> .
<unk> to build a tool for the <unk> of <unk> . He 's <unk> .
It can <unk> new characters in the scene , <unk> their <unk> .
It can <unk> new characters in the scene , <unk> their <unk> .
So , that 's doing the sun .
<unk> : The sun is <unk> .
David <unk> : Now , he has been a <unk> in the scene .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> .
<unk> work ! Yes ! <unk> !
So we <unk> the <unk> and <unk> can make the characters --
<unk> : <unk> !
<unk> its story .
<unk> : <unk> !
<unk> : It 's a final story with open , and it can decide him as <unk> .
<unk> : It 's a final story with open , and it can decide him as <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> away , <unk> .
<unk> : The last example I have time to show you is a <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> music .
It 's a recent tool , by <unk> and <unk> music .
The <unk> here <unk> from the <unk> , and the <unk> .
<unk> of these have four different <unk> , and you can choose what to use .
You can also see these <unk> in a sequence from <unk> to your <unk> .
And I just <unk> by doing a <unk> <unk> , " and a <unk> sequence . "
These are actually that you can control from the live , like the <unk> and <unk> .
It <unk> it to a particular sound and then <unk> for <unk> .
And then there are the effects effects of time and <unk> , which <unk> to the whole sequence .
<unk> like it works .
<unk> : <unk> : <unk> <unk> a <unk> in two <unk> <unk> , " <unk> , " <unk> in a series , the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> ,
Now , you 're going to take a <unk> line .
<unk> <unk> : Now , I 'm going to <unk> <unk>
<unk> : <unk> : And now I 'm going to <unk> the <unk> , so I can control the effect of the live <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> : I can <unk> the whole sequence time by one one one or the other .
<unk> : <unk> : And now we 're going to <unk> the bottom to give more <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> : I can <unk> the <unk> <unk> .
So I don 't have to <unk> before , but I can <unk> , <unk> , <unk> or more <unk> .
And now , finally , I can <unk> the whole sequence <unk> on the left <unk> .
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is to build new <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and more <unk> to how our brain work and body .
And today , I 've got time to show you one of the results of this , and some <unk> that we 're trying to take out from the lab .
And the concept I want to <unk> is that 's going to <unk> this new generation of objects to <unk> , which <unk> information information in our world in our world that we want .
Thank you very much .
I don 't see the time I 'm not seeing all of you .
They 're a <unk> .
<unk> books is my <unk> , but it 's more than that , of course .
It 's also love and <unk> of my life .
And I don 't like that it can change .
But , I said , something particular is <unk> in my life and my career , and my career , which has brought me the whole relationship with this work .
The particular thing is that I wrote this book , this <unk> called " <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , " which , <unk> from my <unk> books , for some reason reason in the world and <unk> a big , <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
And the result is that everywhere <unk> now , people <unk> me as if I was <unk> .
<unk> -- <unk> , <unk> !
I 'm going to be now , I 'm going to say , " You don 't fear of you can 't do better ?
You don 't fear to go to write for all the life without any longer to be able to create a book that can <unk> to somebody ? "
that can you get to somebody ? "
It 's <unk> , you know .
But it could go worse , and I remember that over 20 years ago , when I was saying to people -- I was a <unk> -- I wanted to be a <unk> -- I wanted to be a <unk> .
I 'm going to go to the same <unk> .
And people said , " I don 't want to be able to be <unk> ?
You don 't fear that the <unk> <unk> <unk> you ?
You don 't fear to do this <unk> for all of life without anything to come out and die on a <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> ? "
So , you know .
The answer -- the short answer to all these questions is , " Yes . "
Yes , I 'm afraid of all those things .
I 've always <unk> .
And I 've also fear of many other things that people don 't have <unk> .
As the <unk> and other things .
But , as I 'm going to write what I thought I was going to <unk> me is why ?
Is it <unk> ?
It 's <unk> that anyone who <unk> to be <unk> by a work that you feel born .
But what 's so particular in the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> about health health <unk> <unk> in a way that other <unk> do not ?
How I mean , for example , he was a <unk> <unk> and I remember one time in the <unk> years of <unk> in the <unk> years of <unk> in which he was asked to be <unk> ?
It was never -- that <unk> of the <unk> of John , how do you go ?
<unk> 't that , <unk> ?
<unk> , the engineers like <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
We <unk> , we have enough this <unk> , and not only <unk> but <unk> of all , we have this <unk> of being <unk> <unk> .
And they don 't want to look at the <unk> <unk> <unk> that , only in the <unk> century , <unk> young and often for them .
And those who don 't have <unk> to be really <unk> by their <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , before you can die , in the last <unk> said , " Every my book <unk> me a little bit more " <unk> <unk> about the work of their life .
But we don 't <unk> when we say , because we heard these things so long that in some way we have completely <unk> and <unk> the <unk> that creativity and <unk> are in some way to <unk> and that art , at the end , finally , <unk> to the <unk> .
And the question I want to <unk> to all here is , you 're all the right now is , you 're all the with this idea ?
It 's good to you that -- because it 's going to be <unk> from a <unk> <unk> to me .
I think it 's <unk> .
And I think it 's also <unk> , and I don 't want to <unk> in the next century .
I think it 's better <unk> our <unk> <unk> to live .
And I 'm sure that , in my case -- it would be very <unk> to start <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in which I 'm in my career .
<unk> -- look at , I 'm pretty young , I 've been about 40 years .
I still about four <unk> of work in me .
And it 's very <unk> that anything <unk> in now , and it 's going to be <unk> from the world as the work that <unk> after the <unk> success of my last book .
<unk> <unk> , because we 're all over or less friends here -- is <unk> that my largest success is to my <unk> .
Oh , <unk> , who thought , <unk> !
You know , this is the kind of thinking that leads a person to start <unk> <unk> to nine of the morning and I don 't want to do it .
I 'm going to continue to do this work that I love .
So , the question is it becomes , how ?
And so I think , after many <unk> , that the way of work to continue to <unk> is what to create a <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> ?
I have to get a few <unk> of <unk> between me , which I 'm <unk> , and my natural <unk> on which is going to get out . And as we went to <unk> . And as we 're going to look through through time , and <unk> to find other society to see if you start to get the time time , and find some other society to see if you have better ideas and <unk> ideas .
about how to help people <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of creativity .
And that research brought me to the <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> because I went back to <unk> and then <unk> back .
<unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> -- people don 't believe that creativity <unk> from men , OK ?
It <unk> that creativity was this spirit <unk> <unk> and <unk> to men from a few <unk> <unk> and <unk> , for reasons <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> <unk> these <unk> <unk> of the creativity of <unk> .
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> to have a <unk> that <unk> <unk> from <unk> .
The <unk> were the same idea , but <unk> that species of the spirit without a <unk> .
which is <unk> , because <unk> didn 't really <unk> that a <unk> was somebody who was particularly <unk> .
I thought that a <unk> was this kind of <unk> <unk> that <unk> literally <unk> in the <unk> of the study of a artist , like <unk> <unk> , and that <unk> out out of <unk> the work of the artist and <unk> the result of that work .
<unk> <unk> <unk> you , that 's the distance of the <unk> that <unk> you <unk> you from the results of your work .
And everybody <unk> that was so that you <unk> , right ?
So the artists were <unk> by <unk> things , like the too <unk> , or not ?
If your work was <unk> , you didn 't get <unk> all the <unk> , all of <unk> that <unk> state from this <unk> <unk> .
If your work <unk> , it wasn 't all your <unk> , right ?
Everybody <unk> that was your <unk> to be a <unk> .
And so people <unk> the creativity in <unk> for a long time .
Then the <unk> <unk> and all <unk> , and <unk> this big idea ; we put the human <unk> to the center of the universe above all the <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk>
This was the principle of <unk> <unk> and people to think that creativity <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And for the first time in the history , <unk> to <unk> to this or that artist as a <unk> <unk> <unk> to a <unk> person with <unk> .
And I have to <unk> , I think that was a big <unk> .
I think that I 'm going to <unk> somebody , a simple person to believe that it 's like a <unk> , <unk> and <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> it 's a <unk> <unk> to <unk> human <unk> .
It 's like to ask somebody to <unk> the sun .
<unk> and <unk> the <unk> and <unk> all these <unk> <unk> on the <unk> .
And I think it was this pressure to have <unk> artists in the <unk> 500 years .
And if that 's true , and I think that is , the question , the question becomes , and now ?
Can we do that ?
You can go back to a <unk> understanding of the relationship between humans and <unk> .
Or maybe not .
Maybe we can 't 500 years of thinking in a <unk> <unk> <unk> minutes .
And there 's probably people in the audience that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> on the <unk> , <unk> , you do that <unk> people <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> on their projects .
You probably don 't know all about this thing .
But the question I want to <unk> is -- why ?
Why don 't you know that ?
Because it 's more sense of any other thing that ever heard about to explain the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> process .
A process that , as anyone who ever had to do something -- so , basically , all here -- you know , you don 't have <unk> <unk> .
And in fact , it can be completely <unk> .
I 've been this <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , which has now 90 years , but that was a <unk> for all of life and she said that during his <unk> in the <unk> <unk> , <unk> out in the field , and I <unk> it , in the <unk> , and I <unk> the <unk> out of the <unk> .
He said that it was like a <unk> <unk> of air .
And that <unk> <unk> to her from the <unk> .
I <unk> it to get it , because he <unk> the land under his feet .
I 'm going to have one thing to do at that point and was , words , " <unk> as a <unk> . "
And so I went to home and it was <unk> by this <unk> , and it didn 't have to take a piece of paper and a <unk> enough <unk> , and a <unk> enough <unk> , as the <unk> , <unk> and <unk> on the page .
<unk> times , they didn 't get enough , so <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> without able to get home and <unk> and she <unk> it and she would <unk> it to <unk> through the <unk> and she would go back through the <unk> and she would be <unk> through the <unk> and she would be <unk> through the <unk> and she would have to <unk> through the <unk> and she would have to <unk> it
Then there were the time -- this piece never <unk> it -- there were the moments of moments when the was <unk> , OK ?
So , he was <unk> home and he was looking at home and <unk> the <unk> <unk> through , and <unk> a <unk> <unk> in the <unk> , and then he said , as if you <unk> with the other hand and <unk> .
<unk> the <unk> from the tail and the <unk> in his body and the page <unk> on the page .
And in these cases , the <unk> would be <unk> on the <unk> page and <unk> but at the <unk> , from the last word to the first word .
So when the <unk> <unk> -- it 's <unk> , it 's <unk> , it 's just <unk> to my <unk> process .
I don 't have my <unk> process -- I 'm not a <unk> !
I 'm a <unk> , and my way of <unk> is ; I <unk> it every day and work and work and <unk> over <unk> .
But even me , in my <unk> , I <unk> against that thing , sometimes .
And I 'm going to <unk> that many of you the <unk> .
You know , even if the work and ideas , I <unk> <unk> from a certain source I couldn 't <unk> .
And what is this thing ?
And how can we <unk> it in a way we can 't <unk> your head , but rather , that <unk> us <unk> ?
So , as I 'm going to say , the best example I have been the <unk> <unk> , which I 've been <unk> years ago for a <unk> .
<unk> to this , and you know , <unk> , for the <unk> of life was the <unk> of the <unk> artist , <unk> , <unk> these species of <unk> <unk> .
But then <unk> , he was <unk> , and a day when he was <unk> on a <unk> <unk> , <unk> everything for him .
<unk> <unk> , and all of a <unk> <unk> this little <unk> of <unk> , which comes into his head as <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , and it wants , you know , it 's wonderful , and the <unk> , but not how to <unk> .
It doesn 't have a paper <unk> , not have a <unk> , it doesn 't have a <unk> .
So it starts to hear this kind of old <unk> <unk> in him , like , " I 'm going to <unk> , and <unk> <unk> from this song .
I 'm not <unk> enough , and I can 't <unk> . "
And instead of going to go into the <unk> , they <unk> .
<unk> the whole process process and made something completely new .
I just <unk> the sky and said , " <unk> , you don 't see that I 'm <unk> ? "
" It seems to you that can write a song now ?
If you really want to <unk> , you 're going to take care of you .
<unk> , <unk> to <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . "
And his <unk> process after this .
I don 't work , the work was still <unk> as always .
But the process , and the <unk> <unk> that was <unk> when <unk> the <unk> , the <unk> that <unk> was out of the <unk> , the <unk> that <unk> out of the other than the <unk> , and <unk> <unk> , where it was going to be a <unk> and <unk> .
but I 'm going to do this <unk> , wonderful <unk> <unk> a conversation between <unk> and this thing that was not <unk> .
So how I 'm going to <unk> that story to change a little bit of the way I <unk> and I already <unk> a time .
This idea , I was <unk> when I was <unk> , " <unk> , " <unk> , " and <unk> in one of those <unk> of the <unk> in which we 're all working on something and you can 't think that it 's going to be a <unk> , that 's going to be the book .
Not just <unk> , just <unk> the <unk> book .
And I started thinking about <unk> this project .
But then I 'm going to <unk> me that I 'm going to <unk> the air and <unk> us .
So I <unk> my face in the <unk> and I <unk> my <unk> to a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And I said to <unk> , " <unk> , what , we know , both of we know that if this book is not going to be <unk> my , right ?
Because as you see I 'm going to take it all I don 't have more than that I 've got .
So if you want that to be better , you have to <unk> and do your part .
OK . But if you don 't do it , you know what , I don 't do it , I 'm not going to me .
I 'm going to write the same because it 's my work .
And I 'd like to say that it was <unk> that I 'm going to be <unk> for my part . " Because , it 's so , OK -- <unk> does it <unk> <unk> in the North Africa 's <unk> people to <unk> <unk> to the clear of the moon , <unk> music that <unk> <unk> , and <unk> music that <unk> <unk> to go back to hours to <unk> .
And they were always <unk> , because the <unk> were <unk> and were <unk> .
But every long , <unk> , something <unk> , and one of these <unk> artists actually <unk> .
And I know that I 'm going to talk about what I 'm going to talk about , because I know that you 've all been at some point , a <unk> .
It was like the time <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> through a kind of <unk> and was not doing anything different from , as the <unk> <unk> <unk> , but everything <unk> .
And it 's not just like a human .
But it <unk> from the <unk> and <unk> in the <unk> of <unk> .
And when this <unk> , at the time , people <unk> what was , he <unk> it with her name .
<unk> your hands and <unk> to <unk> , " <unk> , <unk> , God , God , God , God , God , " God . "
That 's God , you know .
You know , when the <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> this <unk> <unk> , <unk> this <unk> with them and <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , " <unk> , " <unk> , " <unk> , " <unk> , " which you can still hear in the <unk> or <unk> .
In <unk> , when an artist has done something impossible and <unk> , " <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> -- a <unk> of God .
And it 's <unk> because we need .
But , the problem comes the next day , for the <unk> , when you <unk> and <unk> and <unk> that are the 11 <unk> of <unk> and <unk> God of God 's <unk> and <unk> God of God 's <unk> .
It 's just a <unk> <unk> with <unk> , and maybe never <unk> more to <unk> to that <unk> .
And maybe one <unk> the name of God still as <unk> , and so what 's got to do with the rest of his life ?
It 's difficult .
This is one of the <unk> <unk> to do in a <unk> life .
But maybe it doesn 't have to be so <unk> if you 're going to <unk> , <unk> , that the <unk> <unk> of your being being from you .
But I just <unk> that you 're going to take you from a <unk> source of this <unk> part of your life , and then you 're going to <unk> when you 're finished .
And , you know , if we think about this way .
And so I started to <unk> , and it 's <unk> like I <unk> for several months in the <unk> of the book that I was going to be <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk>
And what I have to continue to go to <unk> when I feel I feel <unk> from this is not <unk> .
<unk> . It 's not just your work .
You 're going to <unk> for your part , any of it .
If your work is <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
If the <unk> , you 're going to <unk> you to get some kind of <unk> , for one moment through your <unk> , then , just just <unk> ! "
<unk> , do you do the same your <unk> .
And " <unk> ! " " <unk> ! "
I think I think that 's <unk> <unk> .
" <unk> ! " " <unk> ! " <unk> ! " <unk> ! " <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . "
Thank you .
Thank you .
<unk> <unk> : <unk> !
As you know I talked about some of these projects on the human genome , what can <unk> and <unk> and <unk> <unk> new <unk> .
Now we 're going to take a new <unk> , we started to <unk> biology and now start from that digital code , we 're <unk> in a new <unk> of biology , <unk> and <unk> life .
We 've always been trying to <unk> big questions .
" <unk> is life ? " is something that many <unk> I think they have <unk> to understand <unk> to <unk> .
We tried different <unk> , <unk> to the <unk> .
We 're <unk> from almost 20 years .
When we <unk> the human genome <unk> <unk> to go from the world of biology world 's the digital world 's <unk> .
Now , we can <unk> us : we can <unk> life , or create new life from this digital universe ?
This is the map of a small <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , which is the species from the <unk> genome between those that can <unk> in the lab .
And we tried to reduce <unk> the genome to <unk> a little bit smaller .
We can <unk> a <unk> of genes of about 500 that are here .
But when we take a look at its <unk> map , it 's <unk> simple than our .
<unk> , this is simple .
But when we look at all the genes that we can <unk> , one at the time , is very <unk> that this can bring a <unk> cell .
So I thought the only <unk> <unk> was <unk> this <unk> so we could <unk> <unk> the <unk> to <unk> some of these questions .
And so we started the <unk> of the <unk> of " <unk> . "
Can you make the chemistry to produce these big molecules that we never have to create before ?
And in case , <unk> , we can make a <unk> ?
A <unk> is just a piece of <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The speed that we 're able to <unk> the life is <unk> to <unk> <unk> .
Our capacity to write the <unk> code , instead of <unk> , but it 's <unk> .
And our <unk> <unk> <unk> .
We 've got over 15 years ago .
<unk> has <unk> many <unk> , <unk> with a <unk> <unk> before we <unk> the <unk> experiments before <unk> experiments .
But we found that DNA <unk> is very difficult .
There are <unk> of thousands of cars in the world that <unk> small <unk> of DNA , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , and it 's a <unk> process : the <unk> is a <unk> process : the <unk> is <unk> , more <unk> .
So we had to develop a new <unk> to <unk> these <unk> and <unk> the <unk> .
And this was our first <unk> , to start from the digital <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> .
It 's a small virus that bacteria <unk> .
We designed the <unk> , <unk> the <unk> <unk> of <unk> and <unk> a DNA <unk> of <unk> .
The interesting part is when we took this piece of <unk> <unk> <unk> and we <unk> it in bacteria , bacteria have <unk> to read this code and <unk> particles .
<unk> particles have been <unk> by the cells , they 're <unk> back and <unk> the <unk> <unk> .
I talked about recently with the <unk> <unk> <unk> that they have <unk> this model .
They <unk> more of you .
<unk> that this is a situation where the software can actually actually build its own <unk> system .
But we 're going to do the largest things in the <unk> .
You can build the whole <unk> of <unk> .
They 're more than <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
So we thought of <unk> in the size of the virus , so that we can change the <unk> to understand what the <unk> are the <unk> of a <unk> cell .
<unk> is <unk> , and if you <unk> <unk> information in a computer , these have to be very <unk> .
When we <unk> this genome for the first time in the <unk> <unk> was a <unk> for every 10 <unk> <unk> .
We found , <unk> , 30 . If we used that original sequence that original <unk> never been able to do it .
A part of the process is <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> with all the other <unk> of <unk> to build <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> elements here .
You probably have read that <unk> us .
So , we have a <unk> code <unk> on four <unk> : <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> and <unk>
<unk> of those <unk> <unk> together , about 20 <unk> , and there 's a <unk> order to <unk> every <unk> .
So we can use the <unk> code to write words , <unk> , <unk> .
What we did at the beginning was <unk> .
Some have been <unk> by the fact that it wasn 't <unk> .
We designed these <unk> to <unk> <unk> by <unk> .
There are <unk> that <unk> them and <unk> them .
And we started to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
In every step , we 've made these <unk> in <unk> so that we 're <unk> to <unk> that we 're going to see a minute .
We 're trying to <unk> the process .
So , this seems the <unk> of a <unk> <unk> .
When you start these <unk> <unk> , more than 100 <unk> <unk> , they 're not going to be <unk> directly to the <unk> <unk> .
It 's <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> of biology .
So we 've <unk> others .
<unk> of another <unk> called <unk> <unk> , which in biology <unk> to <unk> DNA <unk> <unk> .
So , here 's an example .
This <unk> , called <unk> <unk> , can <unk> three million <unk> of <unk> .
You can see in the <unk> like his <unk> <unk> comes .
In 12 hours , it 's <unk> .
<unk> thousands of organisms that are able to do that .
These organisms can be completely <unk> .
<unk> live under <unk> .
They 're absolutely sure that life <unk> in space , and they 're <unk> to find <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> , NASA has shown that this is .
This is an image of the <unk> that we built using these <unk> , just using these <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> them <unk> them .
This picture was not <unk> with a <unk> <unk> , but with a <unk> <unk> .
It 's a <unk> so big that we can <unk> with a <unk> <unk> .
These are pictures that <unk> a time of about six seconds .
This is the <unk> that we 've done a little time ago .
They 're more than <unk> <unk> <unk> .
It 's the largest <unk> of a <unk> structure ever <unk> from man .
It 's got a <unk> weight to 300 million .
If you <unk> it with a 10 without , there will be <unk> pages to <unk> this <unk> code .
Now , how do we do it work ?
Of course , by a virus is a kids from .
It 's a little bit more <unk> when you use of bacteria .
It 's <unk> when it 's <unk> cells as our : you can just <unk> the <unk> and <unk> another , which is basically the <unk> process .
In <unk> <unk> the <unk> is instead of <unk> in the cell , but we have <unk> <unk> that we 're able to do a <unk> <unk> of a cell <unk> to another and <unk> .
We <unk> a <unk> <unk> from a kind of <unk> .
<unk> are different as the men from the <unk> .
We 've got some <unk> in the <unk> that we can decide what to choose to this <unk> .
<unk> <unk> it <unk> with the <unk> in a way to <unk> all the <unk> .
And when we put it in the cell was <unk> and <unk> our <unk> <unk> the new <unk> went into the cell .
And <unk> <unk> that we don 't go beyond , but we tried to get to <unk> over there .
This is one of the largest <unk> of evolution .
We found that <unk> species have <unk> a second or a third <unk> <unk> from some part , <unk> in a second thousands of new <unk> to that species .
So who think about evolution as a only <unk> to the evolution of it <unk> doesn 't have <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> that was in the cell didn 't <unk> one .
<unk> <unk> that we <unk> it has <unk> .
It 's <unk> , and it <unk> the other <unk> as <unk> material , has <unk> , and we <unk> it with only cell and the new <unk> .
It 's got blue because of the genes that we <unk> .
And in a short <unk> of time , all the <unk> of a species are <unk> <unk> , and it 's <unk> of all over the new software , and we <unk> it into the cell .
All the <unk> are <unk> , the <unk> are <unk> , and when you <unk> the code <unk> exactly to what we have <unk> you .
Now , this may be <unk> <unk> , but we <unk> the DNA can change things in a <unk> <unk> .
Now , I 've already <unk> that here is not about <unk> -- but to <unk> from <unk> million years and a half years and a half years and a half years of evolution , and I already said that maybe we 're going to create a new version of the <unk> <unk> in which we 're going to be <unk> new species on this process .
Why do that ?
I think it 's pretty <unk> when we think of our <unk> .
We 're going to go from six and a half billion people to <unk> billion in the next 40 years .
<unk> for example : I was born in <unk> .
Now , there are three people on the planet to <unk> in the <unk> ; in 40 years , there will be four .
We 're <unk> problems now at food , water <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> for six billion people .
<unk> more <unk> to do that for nine billion .
<unk> than five billion <unk> , over 30 billion <unk> billion <unk> .
That means percent of <unk> a day .
When we try to find <unk> <unk> , or any kind of process to <unk> , it 's going to be a huge challenge .
In the <unk> we have to realize all the <unk> of CO2 from these materials that <unk> in the atmosphere .
And so day , in the <unk> <unk> around the world , we have a <unk> <unk> with about 20 million genes , and I love to think that are the <unk> <unk> for the future .
<unk> industry just a <unk> about <unk> , and think of how many different things are <unk> out .
Our <unk> here are data from the <unk> reality and from our imagination .
Now we have <unk> , because of these <unk> <unk> <unk> , able to create what we call <unk> <unk> <unk> .
We can make a big robot that can make a big robot that can make a million <unk> a <unk> a day .
Think about <unk> these 20 million genes or <unk> to <unk> the <unk> to make <unk> or <unk> , new <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , we can change , because of a small team , and create more biology now that in the last 20 years .
And it 's just a standard <unk> .
We can choose to <unk> , <unk> or <unk> , <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
This is a <unk> of some software <unk> that we 're working on to be able to <unk> and design species to the computer .
Well , we don 't know how they 're going to be .
We know exactly how it 's their <unk> code .
Now we 're going to take us on the <unk> of <unk> .
You saw you also that <unk> <unk> from the <unk> was an experiment .
We 've got <unk> <unk> and third generation that we 're going to be <unk> by <unk> to <unk> <unk> or different kinds of <unk> .
But the only way that biology can have a big impact without <unk> <unk> the cost of food and <unk> the <unk> would be <unk> the CO2 in matter before , so we 're working for cells that that we 're working for cells that we 're going to be able to reach this purpose , and we can think we have the first <unk> of <unk> <unk> in 18 months .
<unk> light <unk> with CO2 is a <unk> , but in our <unk> <unk> , and in our <unk> <unk> .
This is a <unk> that we <unk> in <unk> .
<unk> in the ocean , at about <unk> feet at the temperature of <unk> .
<unk> <unk> from the CO2 using hydrogen <unk> .
We 're trying to understand if we can <unk> the CO2 , that can easily be <unk> by <unk> , <unk> that CO2 in <unk> , to drive this process .
So , I think that we could be able to <unk> what the question is , " which is the <unk> of the <unk> that 's life is , we <unk> , we have the <unk> goal of <unk> the whole industry .
<unk> . If you can 't do that TED , where can you ?
It 's going to be a <unk> of energy .
And we 're working for <unk> <unk> to create <unk> .
You 've seen this year with the flu , we 're always back to a year and with a dollar in less when it 's about <unk> <unk> .
I think what you can change building <unk> <unk> in <unk> .
So , how the future could start to look at the <unk> , the tree , <unk> evolution with bacteria bacteria , <unk> , <unk> cells , and finally cells .
We 're at so <unk> people .
Our goal is to do in a way to live enough to try to try to <unk> . Thank you very much .
First of all , I 'll see the <unk> <unk> , some <unk> work , some <unk> of the new technology that we brought to <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> almost a year ago . This is <unk> .
It 's a environment that you can <unk> is <unk> to local <unk> <unk> with a huge amount of data .
Here we 're seeing <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> with a kind of <unk> <unk> and <unk> , for a <unk> <unk> , <unk> the images as we want .
And it doesn 't matter how big it is the amount of information that we see , how big these <unk> of data or images .
Most of them are common photographs , but this for example is a <unk> <unk> from the <unk> of the <unk> , and <unk> in the <unk> of 300 <unk> .
It doesn 't make any difference because the only thing that <unk> the <unk> of a system like this is the number of <unk> on your screen in any time . It 's also a very <unk> architecture .
This is a whole book , example of data is not <unk> .
This is <unk> <unk> <unk> . Every <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
So , to <unk> that is just <unk> and not images , we can do something like that , to actually see that it 's a real <unk> <unk> of the <unk> , not a picture .
It may be a little bit of <unk> for read a <unk> book .
I don 't <unk> it .
This is an <unk> example . It 's a number of <unk> .
Every picture is the beginning of a <unk> .
And it really gives you the pleasure and the <unk> experience of read the <unk> version of a <unk> or a <unk> , or a <unk> , which is for nature a <unk> of a half .
We also did something with the corner of this particular number of <unk> .
We created a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> than the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
If you want to see the <unk> of this <unk> , you can see here .
Or , or even <unk> <unk> .
And this really <unk> some of these ideas to <unk> the <unk> of space .
I thought that this <unk> to put it into the <unk> and other <unk> <unk> , not to be <unk> .
Of course , the <unk> is one of the most <unk> <unk> for this kind of technology .
And on this , I don 't want to lose time , if we don 't say that we have <unk> to give them in this field .
These are all the streets in the U.S. <unk> picture a <unk> picture of NASA .
So now I 'm going to start something else .
This is actually now from the Web ; you can see you start to see .
It 's a project called <unk> , which <unk> two different technologies .
A <unk> is <unk> and the other is a <unk> research that <unk> <unk> , a student of the <unk> <unk> , a student of the <unk> of Washington , with help <unk> <unk> <unk> . A <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And it 's from the Web , <unk> from <unk> .
You can see when we do this kind of <unk> , where we can go from a picture to the other and have this kind of experience to <unk> .
But the <unk> <unk> of images here has actually a meaning .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and these images are <unk> these images together , so that we 're going to <unk> to the <unk> <unk> <unk> on the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . And you see some of the elements of the elements of a <unk> or <unk> of <unk> , and these things are all <unk> at the <unk> level .
I don 't know if I 've got time to show some other environment .
There are a lot more <unk> .
I want to go directly to one of the <unk> of <unk> data and this <unk> <unk> <unk> that we 've done this work for the first time in the summer for the first time to show you what 's really the key to the key to the <unk> that we have in the website .
We had to <unk> <unk> <unk> and on .
This is a <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> <unk> images from <unk> . <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> and <unk> images of these <unk> and <unk> images of these <unk> and <unk> and so on . And he 's going to be a picture that 's going to be <unk> to this model .
So they 're all <unk> images from <unk> and have all been <unk> to the <unk> level in this way .
And it 's possible to <unk> in this <unk> way .
You know , I 'd never thought to end up working for <unk> .
It 's very <unk> <unk> this kind of <unk> here .
I think I think you 're going to see that it 's a lot of <unk> . <unk> : from those <unk> <unk> , a number of <unk> , <unk> number , <unk> together in this environment .
And if I can , I 'm going to try and look at the <unk> .
A lot of them are <unk> by <unk> , etc . .
<unk> there is a series of photographs -- <unk> .
This is a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
We can go from the <unk> to the physics of this environment .
The <unk> point is that we can do with the environment . This is now <unk> data from the whole memory memory of how we <unk> the land , from the point of view of view and <unk> all those data together .
All those pictures become <unk> together , and more than the <unk> of the parts .
You have a model of the whole <unk> that <unk> .
Think about this as the <unk> of the work of <unk> <unk> on Earth .
It 's something that <unk> in the <unk> of <unk> , and the <unk> that <unk> for who <unk> the <unk> <unk> to the use of use .
Their pictures are <unk> with <unk> from other people .
If somebody comes the idea of <unk> all these <unk> <unk> the name , my picture of the name of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of all those data data , and I can use how to <unk> in that space , using the picture of all those data , using the picture of anyone and have a social experience of experience , and <unk> .
Of course , a <unk> of this is very <unk> models of every interesting part of the land , <unk> not just by <unk> <unk> and images and <unk> images and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> .
Chris Anderson : I understand ? What I have to do is that your software <unk> us to do is that at some point , in the next years , all the photographs of anyone who are <unk> by the world <unk> <unk> ?
<unk> : Yes . What 's doing is actually <unk> .
It 's creating <unk> , if you want , between images .
And he 's doing it in the <unk> of images .
The thing becomes very interesting , if you think about the <unk> of information information that many of these images .
As a <unk> of images , as you do a <unk> <unk> and the <unk> on the <unk> page has a lot of information about images .
Now , what happens if that picture is going on if that picture is going on to all your picture ?
So the amount of <unk> <unk> and the amount of <unk> that <unk> is really enormous . It 's a very huge <unk> . It 's a <unk> effect of the network .
CA : <unk> , it 's really incredible . <unk> .
<unk> : I 'm going to tell you a lot .
One of the main <unk> when you <unk> and one of the <unk> research is that we can live in the <unk> <unk> , in who didn 't have the <unk> <unk> , in the <unk> <unk> from the <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> to think that <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , or that <unk> <unk> are still <unk> <unk> of <unk> , or that <unk> , or <unk> , or <unk> , or <unk> , <unk> , to <unk> the <unk> <unk> , to <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> , and that the idea that the world that the world in which we don 't have any sense , but it 's just a <unk> of the <unk> , but it 's actually not a <unk> model .
the <unk> of a particular <unk> of <unk> choices that our <unk> has done , or <unk> , many <unk> ago .
And of course , all of the <unk> <unk> .
All <unk> . <unk> .
We 're <unk> to <unk> <unk> .
We have to deal with the <unk> of death , so we don 't <unk> it and <unk> --
We all have a art .
What <unk> is the particular <unk> of the song , the <unk> of <unk> of any culture .
<unk> 't matter that are the <unk> of the <unk> , or <unk> <unk> <unk> , or <unk> <unk> <unk> , or <unk> <unk> <unk> , or a <unk> in <unk> <unk> , or a <unk> in the heart of the <unk> , or a <unk> in the heart of the <unk> <unk> .
He was my <unk> of journey in the <unk> a month ago , or a <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of <unk> , on the <unk> , the <unk> mother 's mother 's <unk> .
All these <unk> <unk> us that there are other ways of <unk> other ways of thinking , other ways to move into the world .
And if you take a moment , it 's a concept that can give you hope .
<unk> , the <unk> of <unk> of the world create a <unk> of life and <unk> that <unk> the planet and is important for the <unk> of the planet as <unk> <unk> .
And you can think of this <unk> <unk> as a <unk> and you can <unk> the <unk> <unk> of all the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> ideas , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> in being from the imagination of <unk> .
<unk> is the <unk> <unk> of humanity .
It 's the <unk> of what we are and what we can be in how <unk> species .
And <unk> the <unk> was <unk> <unk> <unk> was <unk> to <unk> and <unk> a lot more <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , for example , <unk> that 50 percent of all the species has been or is on the <unk> of the <unk> simply because it 's <unk> , or -- in the <unk> <unk> -- and you don 't even even even even <unk> to the <unk> <unk> -- that of the diversity .
<unk> of this is , of course , the <unk> <unk> .
When you 're <unk> <unk> <unk> on this planet .
A language is not just <unk> by a <unk> or a series of <unk> rules .
A language is the <unk> of the human spirit .
It 's the middle that the <unk> of every culture comes in the world .
Every language is a forest of the mind , a <unk> , a thought of a <unk> of <unk> .
And of those <unk> <unk> , while we 're sitting here in <unk> , at least half the <unk> is not <unk> in the <unk> of the children .
They 're not going to be <unk> to the children , which means , at least that <unk> <unk> something that are already death .
What 's more <unk> of being <unk> by the <unk> , of being the last to speak a language , of not <unk> the <unk> of <unk> or <unk> the <unk> of <unk> or <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> or <unk> the <unk> of the children ?
This <unk> <unk> was the state of somebody in some of the world every two weeks : every two weeks , a <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And I know somebody of you know , " <unk> 't that better ?
The world doesn 't have a better place if we <unk> all the same language ? " <unk> , then we 're all <unk> . <unk> .
<unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , what it means to say , I can 't talk about their language .
And I 'd like to give you a journey , and I 'd like to give you a journey ,
a little journey in the <unk> to give you a <unk> of what we 're <unk> .
Many of us <unk> that when I say , " different ways of <unk> . " I mean , very different ways of <unk> .
<unk> for example , this <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , which <unk> to the <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
It 's a <unk> that it 's not able to <unk> the blue color because the <unk> is <unk> in the time of the forest , from which <unk> the <unk> .
They have a <unk> language and a <unk> rule , " <unk> <unk> " : you have to <unk> a person who talks a different language .
And all that has been <unk> in the past <unk> , but the <unk> is that in these families or seven <unk> because of the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
You start to listen and then you start talking about it .
I 'm going to have one of the <unk> <unk> that I lived , the <unk> <unk> <unk> , an incredible <unk> that had the first <unk> in <unk> .
In <unk> five <unk> have <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
They 've done from the top photographs that <unk> them in <unk> that <unk> <unk> , <unk> that this <unk> <unk> <unk> had never seen anything about <unk> .
They <unk> the picture from the land , they <unk> to the research of a form or a <unk> and <unk> , not <unk> , they have <unk> <unk> , and they <unk> the five <unk> with <unk> .
But <unk> not only <unk> the <unk> .
They <unk> in them .
<unk> percent of the <unk> was <unk> by their own .
We 've been <unk> eight <unk> and we found two <unk> <unk> and <unk> to know , they 've <unk> that one of them was so <unk> that he was so that he died , and then they <unk> it . And then they <unk> it . And then they <unk> it .
<unk> were able to recognize the animal <unk> from 40 <unk> and <unk> the species .
<unk> years before <unk> , I was <unk> a really interesting task when my <unk> <unk> me if my <unk> <unk> me if I wanted to go to <unk> <unk> between society to the <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> to <unk> the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> to make the <unk> .
To give a sense of <unk> , I should understand the <unk> culture and that <unk> is not <unk> .
It 's quite about a <unk> <unk> <unk> of the world .
Very interesting .
If you 're going to tell you the big <unk> of the world , what would you do ?
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , etc . .
A continent has no <unk> out , thinking that Africa doesn 't have <unk> <unk> <unk> . And instead and <unk> is not the other that <unk> of these <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> .
What makes the <unk> is the <unk> of the <unk> between life and death .
So the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> can be <unk> by the <unk> <unk> , <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> and <unk> <unk> to the <unk> of the live in such a short moment , the <unk> becomes the <unk> .
So , for the <unk> <unk> to say , " <unk> <unk> go to talk about God .
We 're <unk> in <unk> and <unk> God . "
And from the moment that you 're <unk> , is the spirit that <unk> you can you make it <unk> ?
So , you start to these incredible <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a pretty strong <unk> of the power of the body when it 's <unk> in a state of <unk> .
I 'm going to all the <unk> that I lived the most <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , in the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , in the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> of <unk> civilization that once <unk> on the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
In a blood continent <unk> , this <unk> never been <unk> by <unk> .
<unk> today are <unk> by a <unk> , but they 're <unk> by a <unk> , but they 're <unk> .
The young <unk> are <unk> from families to three or four years , and they live <unk> in a world <unk> and <unk> in a world <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> for 18 years .
<unk> <unk> years <unk> of nine years <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
So , for all this time , they 're <unk> to the values of their society , values that <unk> and only <unk> <unk> <unk> -- or to say the <unk> <unk> -- or to say the <unk> <unk> .
And then , this incredible <unk> , they 're <unk> out and for the first time in their life , at the age of 18 , they see a <unk> . And in that moment of <unk> of the first <unk> , when the sun <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , all that they 're <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , all that they 're <unk> into the <unk> .
" <unk> ? I 'm going to tell you how I said .
It 's <unk> . Now , it 's going to tell you . "
They call it <unk> and say that we , <unk> <unk> , we 're the <unk> of the world 's <unk> .
This level of <unk> is extremely important .
When we think of the <unk> <unk> and the <unk> <unk> and the old story of the <unk> <unk> , which is a <unk> concept in its <unk> or maybe <unk> <unk> and say that these <unk> are more than us to us .
<unk> <unk> are not <unk> or <unk> by <unk> .
There 's no space for these things in the <unk> of <unk> or in the <unk> <unk> , but because of time and <unk> , have created a <unk> of Earth of the Earth <unk> , and <unk> <unk> , and on a <unk> <unk> <unk> , but on a <unk> <unk> <unk> , but on a <unk> <unk> of the Earth can live because it 's <unk> by the <unk> of human <unk> .
What does that mean ?
I mean that a <unk> of the <unk> that <unk> <unk> that the mountain is a <unk> <unk> that <unk> is going to be a human human <unk> and <unk> <unk> , and it will have a <unk> <unk> of the mountain that place , or that place to a <unk> of the <unk> that place that a mountain <unk> of <unk> that a mountain <unk> of <unk> to be <unk> .
which is the <unk> of one or a <unk> <unk> is <unk> .
What 's interesting is the <unk> that <unk> the relationship between the <unk> and the natural world .
I grew up in the <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> for being <unk> .
And that has me to be different from my friends who believe that <unk> are the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> that are <unk> in the world , <unk> that are <unk> in the world , <unk> that <unk> in the world , <unk> that <unk> in the world , <unk> that <unk> in the world , <unk> that are <unk> <unk> .
If you start to <unk> that these <unk> can actually create different , and we start to understand some of them <unk> .
I 've been <unk> this picture in the <unk> <unk> .
Maybe some of you have heard about the <unk> , the most powerful <unk> of the <unk> <unk> .
What makes the <unk> is not the potential <unk> <unk> , but its <unk> . It 's <unk> by two elements .
On one side , this <unk> <unk> that <unk> a series of <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , <unk> .
<unk> the only <unk> has a <unk> <unk> that <unk> a little bit of the <unk> , but it 's <unk> with the <unk> of a <unk> of the family of the <unk> <unk> said <unk> .
This <unk> <unk> <unk> , very similar to <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
If you 're going to see the <unk> <unk> on the <unk> that are doing from a different <unk> of species , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> that <unk> on the <unk> is a little bit of like being <unk> by a <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> on a <unk> of electricity . It doesn 't create a <unk> of electricity . It doesn 't make a <unk> of reality ; it makes the <unk> of reality .
I often had a lot of my <unk> , Richard <unk> <unk> , the man who <unk> the <unk> was <unk> , with his discovery of <unk> in the ' <unk> .
My <unk> can 't be <unk> these <unk> as <unk> because if you 're <unk> , because if you 're not going to tell anybody to be <unk> because they 're <unk> by a <unk> that <unk> because they 're <unk> by a <unk> that <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> .
It 's possible to <unk> , if you could <unk> with other <unk> <unk> that <unk> .
Now the <unk> is the <unk> that are in this <unk> are <unk> of the <unk> , of the kind of <unk> to <unk> the <unk> . The question <unk> question : in a <unk> of species of plants , like these <unk> to <unk> two <unk> , they 're not like these <unk> to <unk> two <unk> , but if you 're going to <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the parts ?
We use the great <unk> of <unk> and <unk> , which can <unk> <unk> .
But if you go to the <unk> , we 'll say , " <unk> us . "
What does that mean ?
This <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , which <unk> <unk> in the forest , and that our eyes <unk> in the forest species .
If the <unk> like <unk> their <unk> us , " <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of them ? " I said , " No . "
The solution is , they take the <unk> <unk> in a <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> with a different <unk> .
With this not <unk> us to <unk> , but it 's much more interesting that <unk> the <unk> .
Now , [ <unk> ] the problem is that the ones of us that have to <unk> the <unk> <unk> them , but in some way to <unk> the <unk> of the history of the history of the history of the world , and <unk> <unk> .
In fact , the <unk> century , in 300 years , not <unk> <unk> for its <unk> or its <unk> <unk> , but rather as the was where we <unk> and <unk> or <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> of diversity and <unk> or <unk> the <unk> of the planet . And we have <unk> or <unk> the problem . And now the problem is not the problem is not the change .
All the <unk> through the <unk> have been <unk> in a <unk> for new <unk> .
And the problem is not technology .
<unk> didn 't have <unk> to be <unk> when they put <unk> <unk> and <unk> so they 're <unk> and <unk> like <unk> have <unk> to be <unk> when they put it from <unk> and <unk> .
It 's not the change or technology that <unk> the <unk> of <unk> . It 's the power .
<unk> <unk> <unk> .
And if you look at the world , you can 't get <unk> <unk> to <unk> .
They 're <unk> creatures and <unk> out of the existence of forces that are <unk> by their <unk> <unk> .
<unk> that <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk> --
a <unk> <unk> <unk> , in the <unk> <unk> , a <unk> that has <unk> <unk> in the forest to a generation ago , and now <unk> to the <unk> and <unk> on the <unk> and <unk> on the <unk> of the <unk> , where you can see the river <unk> from the <unk> <unk> that seems to the <unk> <unk> <unk> , where the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , where the <unk> <unk> <unk> ,
<unk> to <unk> the <unk> <unk> to the forest <unk> .
Or , in the case of <unk> , are the disease that are <unk> with the <unk> discovery of <unk> .
If you <unk> on the <unk> of the <unk> , where I 'm doing a lot of research , you 'll see the <unk> <unk> of politics .
As <unk> the <unk> , the <unk> <unk> of a <unk> , is <unk> at the <unk> , but <unk> , <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> , not just is <unk> , but <unk> in certain <unk> , because it 's part of <unk> , because it 's part of <unk> .
And you can 't understand the <unk> of the <unk> until the beginning .
I 've got the <unk> miles from <unk> in China through the <unk> <unk> , <unk> to <unk> with a young <unk> , but only to <unk> it . I realized what the <unk> that was going to talk about .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> million people <unk> from the <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> .
The father of this guy was <unk> to the <unk> <unk> .
which means that it was <unk> to the <unk> of Chinese <unk> .
<unk> <unk> is <unk> with <unk> <unk> in the <unk> that brought the <unk> in <unk> .
My mother was <unk> and his <unk> was being <unk> .
It was <unk> to <unk> at the age of two years <unk> <unk> his <unk> because he didn 't have to live without him .
<unk> , who did the same , was <unk> in <unk> field .
A day has <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and , for this <unk> , was <unk> to the <unk> <unk> for seven years .
The pain of the <unk> can be <unk> , but the spirit of the <unk> is from <unk> <unk> .
<unk> , all you 're going to <unk> to a choice .
<unk> live in the <unk> world or we want to <unk> the world of diversity ?
The great <unk> <unk> <unk> , before he 's going to die that the largest fear was that , in our <unk> to this <unk> vision of the world , not only <unk> the whole <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of human imagination , but a day , we <unk> us from a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that were other opportunity .
And it 's <unk> to remember that our species is <unk> for <unk> years .
<unk> <unk> , who <unk> us to us <unk> , <unk> us to us <unk> <unk> , <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> with the <unk> of <unk> , creating the <unk> of <unk> , creating the <unk> of <unk> , and we 're talking about <unk> years ago .
The <unk> world has <unk> <unk> <unk> .
That <unk> story , I didn 't know that we have the answers to all the challenges that we 're going to <unk> in the <unk> to come .
When these <unk> <unk> of the world 's <unk> , what it means to say to be human , <unk> with <unk> different <unk> .
And it 's in these answers that we all all <unk> can <unk> the opportunity to be what we are , a <unk> species , that has to <unk> and all the <unk> can <unk> . And there are big moments of <unk> .
I <unk> this picture on the <unk> <unk> of <unk> , when I went to <unk> <unk> with <unk> , and this man , <unk> , and this man , <unk> me , <unk> , he <unk> me the wonderful story of his <unk> .
The government is not always <unk> <unk> with the <unk> <unk> and in the ' <unk> for <unk> our <unk> , we <unk> them in <unk> .
The <unk> of this man <unk> <unk> .
<unk> , <unk> for his life , the <unk> <unk> all the <unk> , and all his <unk> .
You know that <unk> doesn 't <unk> the cold , <unk> it .
The <unk> of <unk> were made of <unk> fish <unk> in <unk> .
The <unk> of this man didn 't <unk> from night or <unk> <unk> .
And it 's <unk> , it <unk> the <unk> <unk> and <unk> into his hand . When I did it , I made it , it has <unk> , and <unk> it into a <unk> .
He <unk> <unk> on the <unk> of this <unk> <unk> and when <unk> <unk> , has <unk> a dog .
He <unk> the dog and created a <unk> , with the <unk> <unk> has created a <unk> , has <unk> another dog , and it 's <unk> on the <unk> , <unk> <unk> in <unk> .
<unk> to talk about <unk> ? [ [ <unk> ] . And this , in different ways , [ <unk> ] is the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> and all the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> government <unk> to the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
It 's their new <unk> . It 's called <unk> .
It 's a <unk> <unk> . <unk> all the <unk> resources .
One <unk> example of how a <unk> can <unk> with his <unk> .
And , to end , I think it 's pretty <unk> at least who 's been in these <unk> <unk> of the planet , that they <unk> at all .
For somebody 's home .
<unk> <unk> of the <unk> of the human imagination that <unk> to the <unk> of the time . And for us all , dreams of these children , as the dreams of our children , become part of the <unk> of hope .
<unk> , we 're <unk> <unk> that <unk> are <unk> that <unk> never <unk> to anything .
<unk> that <unk> --
<unk> are not <unk> , but we believe that stories can change the world , and maybe we are the best <unk> to tell the stories of the world . Every month our site <unk> million <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> our <unk> <unk> .
Our <unk> are <unk> by millions of people .
Our work is <unk> in <unk> to bring our audience in places to bring our audience in places of <unk> <unk> from which <unk> <unk> from which <unk> from which <unk> , and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , we have to find a <unk> of life in a <unk> world and <unk> a <unk> world of life in a <unk> world and <unk> .
where the <unk> of all the <unk> can <unk> to our <unk> <unk> .
Thank you .
I 'm going to talk about some of the things I wrote in this book I hope you 've heard and <unk> some <unk> , and I 'm going to <unk> them .
I want to start with what I call " the <unk> <unk> . "
<unk> <unk> of what ?
<unk> <unk> of all the society <unk> <unk> <unk> . The <unk> <unk> <unk> : " If we want to <unk> the <unk> of our citizens , " <unk> , " <unk> the way to do it is <unk> . "
The reason is , from one side , in the fact that the freedom is in itself , <unk> , <unk> for human beings .
<unk> another is in fact that if we 're <unk> , each of us can act for that to do everything that <unk> our <unk> , without no one that we 're going to be in our own own own .
The way to <unk> the freedom is <unk> .
<unk> choices people have , more choices , and it 's the <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> , is their <unk> .
This , <unk> , it 's so <unk> <unk> in society that no one <unk> of <unk> in <unk> .
And it 's also <unk> <unk> in our lives .
I 'm going to show you some examples of what progress has made possible .
This is my <unk> . It 's not particularly big .
I 'm going to give a simple <unk> on the <unk> for <unk> .
In my <unk> , there are <unk> <unk> , without <unk> the 10 <unk> of <unk> <unk> and the 12 <unk> <unk> that you can buy for a huge number of <unk> in the <unk> <unk> that no one of the <unk> of your <unk> .
So , what the <unk> is .
Then you go to the store <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
And in this single store of <unk> , there 's a big number of <unk> .
We can make six million and a half million different <unk> using the <unk> that there are only one store .
<unk> <unk> that there is <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> : the world 's <unk> .
Once I was a child , when I was a child , you could get all the services <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
You <unk> the phone , not <unk> it .
A <unk> of that , between the other , was that the phone never <unk> .
These days they went .
Now we have a <unk> almost <unk> <unk> , especially between <unk> .
So , the <unk> of the future .
My <unk> is that in the middle , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , and <unk> for <unk> <unk> .
If you 're not going to be the store in the store house , you 're <unk> that soon .
And what 's the end of the end happens is that people <unk> and make this question , you know is the answer ? The answer is , " No . "
It 's not possible to buy a phone that doesn 't <unk> things .
So , in other <unk> of life that are much more important than <unk> , <unk> the same <unk> of choices .
<unk> <unk> : <unk> , not happens in the United States that you 're going to <unk> and the <unk> you <unk> what you have to do .
Instead , <unk> from the <unk> , and the <unk> says , " OK , could do , or <unk> , or <unk> , " <unk> , " <unk> , " <unk> , " <unk> , " <unk> , " <unk> , could you do ? "
You 're going to say , " What do you do you do ? "
And the <unk> says , " <unk> has these <unk> and these <unk> , and <unk> has these <unk> and these <unk> and these <unk> . "
" What do you want to do ? "
And you 're going to say , " If you were me , what would you say ? "
And the <unk> , " but I 'm not her . "
The result , we call it " <unk> " , " <unk> " , " <unk> that does seem a beautiful thing .
But it 's not that one <unk> the weight and responsibility to take from somebody who knows something , <unk> the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and almost of course , it 's not <unk> -- and so in the <unk> <unk> to take out of the patient , and so that 's not in the <unk> <unk> .
There 's a huge <unk> of products , <unk> to people like me and you , and you , that if you think about it has no sense , because we can 't <unk> .
But if we can 't <unk> , why can we do it ?
The answer is that they want to <unk> the <unk> to <unk> the <unk> .
<unk> of how <unk> is our <unk> , is a question of choice , as you see in this <unk> , " <unk> , we don 't want to <unk> kids . <unk> their sex at the right now . " We have to <unk> . " <unk> a <unk> : we have to have to <unk> .
And we can <unk> how many times we can <unk> .
which means that any <unk> , at the <unk> , you have to decide that kind of person .
<unk> to the family and <unk> , a time time the <unk> , <unk> almost for anyone , was that you <unk> the <unk> as soon as possible .
The only real choice was with who , not when , and I even knew what to do after .
<unk> , it 's really <unk> to play .
<unk> to <unk> students , very smart , and they <unk> them to <unk> them .
And because they 're not <unk> , because they 're not <unk> .
but why are <unk> , <unk> to <unk> , " <unk> <unk> or not ? <unk> do it now ? "
" <unk> <unk> <unk> later ? I have to think about the children or the career ? "
They 're <unk> <unk> .
And they try to answer these questions , and even if this <unk> <unk> <unk> and not <unk> the <unk> that <unk> and not get a big <unk> <unk> to my <unk> .
And they have to do that . They 're really important questions .
Now , the work : we 're <unk> , as <unk> <unk> , because the technology <unk> us to work every minute , every day , from every day , from every day , <unk> that from the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , there 's a <unk> , and I 'm not going to say , where the <unk> works .
I don 't say that , because I want to use it .
What does , this incredible freedom to choice that we have about work ? What we have to <unk> , <unk> in every time , if we have to work or not .
We can go to see our son to <unk> , with the phone in a <unk> , the <unk> in the other , and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , on the <unk> .
And even if they 're all <unk> , every minute that we see our son <unk> , we 're also <unk> , " I have to answer this call ? "
" I have to answer this <unk> ? I have to <unk> this letter ? "
And even when the answer is , " no , " that makes it a lot of the <unk> experience of your son very different from what it would be in other conditions .
So , from any part of all of these things , and <unk> and <unk> of life , and <unk> and <unk> of life , is a question of choices .
Once the world was this , <unk> , there were some chance , but not everything was a question of choice .
The world of today , I 'm going to talk about this : <unk> is , or <unk> ? "
The answer is <unk> .
So the <unk> <unk> them all , so I 'm going to talk about those <unk> .
<unk> this choice <unk> .
The first , <unk> , is that <unk> <unk> instead of <unk> .
With many <unk> between which to choose , it becomes very difficult to do .
I 'm going to give you an example , a study <unk> <unk> .
A <unk> has <unk> to the <unk> data , the <unk> society of <unk> <unk> , with about a million <unk> in <unk> .
What she found is that for every 10 solutions that are <unk> in the most , the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> two percent .
<unk> <unk> , there is 10 percent in less than <unk> when they 're available to <unk> than when they 're available to <unk> . Why ?
Because with 50 <unk> <unk> in which <unk> , is difficult to decide , and choice is <unk> to <unk> .
And <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> , and of course <unk> , and of course <unk> never comes .
<unk> that doesn 't mean that these <unk> <unk> <unk> food to <unk> because they 're not going to have enough money , it takes enough money , and it 's so <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> , they 're going to be five to <unk> <unk> for year from the <unk> of work , which would be <unk> to <unk> .
So the <unk> is a <unk> of <unk> choices .
And I think that 's going to be the world .
" And to end , to the <unk> : <unk> , <unk> or <unk> ? "
You want to take the right decision , if it 's for <unk> , right ?
You don 't want to choose the wrong <unk> , and you <unk> the wrong <unk> .
So this is the first effect . The second is that we can <unk> <unk> and make a choice , at the end , we 're less <unk> by the result of how <unk> <unk> <unk> with less than you want to choose .
And that 's <unk> for different reasons .
One of these is that with many <unk> between which to choose , and it 's not perfect , it 's not perfect , it 's easy to imagine that you could have a different choice that would have been better . And what happens is that <unk> <unk> us to <unk> us to <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> by <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> from choice , and the <unk> <unk> <unk> ,
And when it was a <unk> decision .
<unk> choices , there are <unk> , <unk> of any <unk> that is <unk> of choice .
<unk> , there is what <unk> call .
Dan <unk> has <unk> very well as the value that we <unk> to do with what we <unk> .
<unk> , when there are many <unk> , and it 's easy to <unk> the <unk> <unk> of <unk> and <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> and <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> that <unk> is choice .
So , one example . I 'm going to <unk> with all the those who are not in New York .
But that 's what you probably <unk> .
There 's this <unk> to the <unk> .
A <unk> place .
<unk> <unk> . <unk> day . It 's all for them .
It 's not <unk> . But what he thinks is , " Well , <unk> , it 's <unk> . "
" All my <unk> <unk> are on . "
" <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . "
And it <unk> two weeks from the idea that 's <unk> -- every day -- the <unk> <unk> where it wants .
<unk> <unk> the <unk> for what we have , even when the choice was <unk> .
And the <unk> are the <unk> that we have from <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Here 's another example .
This <unk> tells us a lot of things .
It 's about the time , and maybe maybe in the live .
But the most important point is that anything you 're going to , you 're going to <unk> .
The things that don 't have many <unk> that can make less <unk> what we do .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> <unk> .
I tried it on my skin <unk> a couple of <unk> .
It 's almost always <unk> .
Once the <unk> were <unk> of one like , <unk> them and <unk> , were <unk> , only after <unk> , they were <unk> , only after <unk> a lot of times , and we 're going to go .
So , I went to <unk> a new when the <unk> were gone , and I said , " I need a couple of <unk> , this is my <unk> . "
<unk> said , " <unk> me , " <unk> wants to <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> ? "
<unk> wants to <unk> or with <unk> ? " <unk> " <unk> " or " <unk> ? "
" " <unk> wants to <unk> ? "
" <unk> want them to <unk> or <unk> ? <unk> <unk> <unk> -- " <unk> <unk> .
I was <unk> , and after a little bit of I was able to say , " I want the kind of -- that was the only guy , so for a time time , I was <unk> by the store , and then I <unk> from the store , <unk> from the store , <unk> from the <unk> , <unk> , with the best of the best <unk> I had ever had .
It was the <unk> . With all that choice I had <unk> the best .
But I 'm going to be worse .
Why ? I wrote a whole book for <unk> .
The reason I was , I was worse is that with all my <unk> were <unk> , the <unk> <unk> to be <unk> .
I had <unk> <unk> . I didn 't <unk> me to <unk> me when I just had a kind of <unk> , but when you get 100 different , at least one kind of to be perfect .
What I had <unk> was good , but not perfect .
After I had <unk> that with what I was <unk> in <unk> to the <unk> .
<unk> <unk> in the people of the people don 't do that <unk> the <unk> of these <unk> <unk> .
And this <unk> <unk> , even when the results are good .
<unk> in the world of the <unk> <unk> if it makes it .
Because if you <unk> , I 'm not going to talk about what I 'm talking about .
The truth <unk> <unk> to this .
" It was better when he was worse , " The reason why he was <unk> to the <unk> was that when he was worse is that when she was worse .
<unk> , in the world that we live in -- <unk> , <unk> citizens with the <unk> of <unk> -- the <unk> that we can <unk> is that things are <unk> .
You 've never never ever <unk> because your <unk> , my <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
The <unk> of happiness -- what you 're here -- is , " <unk> <unk> " Yes , you want to do . "
I mean , little <unk> moment -- that I 'm really <unk> and my wife is really <unk> .
I didn 't have to do that , I didn 't have me <unk> .
But <unk> is not a <unk> thing .
<unk> , a <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> when there is just that kind of <unk> is that when you 're not <unk> , and you say , " Why ? "
" Who is <unk> ? " , the answer is <unk> .
The world is the <unk> . What I could I do it ?
When there are hundreds of <unk> , and you <unk> a <unk> , and you <unk> a <unk> , and you 're going to <unk> you who is <unk> , is <unk> that the <unk> you are you .
I could do better .
With hundreds of <unk> available , there are no <unk> for <unk> .
So when people make decisions , even if the result is <unk> , they <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> them to them them .
In the last few years , the <unk> is <unk> in the <unk> world .
I think a <unk> <unk> -- not the only , but important -- of this <unk> <unk> is just that people have <unk> experiences because the standard are too <unk> .
And when they have to <unk> this situation , they 're going to be .
So the final result is that in general , we 're better , but we 're going to be worse .
I 'm going to tell you .
This is the <unk> <unk> , what we all take for good and it 's completely <unk> . It 's not true .
There 's no <unk> that a little bit of choice is better than <unk> , but from this <unk> , not <unk> that much choice is better than a little bit of a little bit .
There 's a <unk> , <unk> . I don 't know what it 's .
But I 'm sure we 've <unk> from a piece of the level that the choices <unk> our own life .
Now , from the <unk> point -- I 'm almost finished -- from the point of view , the <unk> is the <unk> .
What allows all this choice in the <unk> society is the <unk> material .
There are many places in the world , and you know , <unk> <unk> , where the problem is not that they have <unk> choice .
The problem is that they have too <unk> .
So the <unk> I 'm talking about is a <unk> of <unk> , <unk> society .
And what <unk> does <unk> and <unk> is this : <unk> <unk> <unk> you talked about yesterday how those <unk> and <unk> <unk> to <unk> are <unk> . It 's a <unk> of money .
I mean that these choices , <unk> and <unk> , is not that they 're just <unk> .
They 're <unk> <unk> .
They 're doing that .
If a little bit of what in our society allows choice to be <unk> in those where people have too much much , it would not just be their life to <unk> , but also our own own life .
This is what <unk> call a <unk> <unk> .
A <unk> of income <unk> <unk> , well , not just to the poor poor -- because of this choice in <unk> that <unk> us .
So , I 'm going to end , " You can become everything you want to --
<unk> , people , <unk> , <unk> , " What do you know ? "
" It 's <unk> that you can 't make anything in a glass <unk> . "
" A <unk> imagination , a <unk> <unk> <unk> of the world --
And I <unk> it so I <unk> it so , at the beginning .
But then , <unk> , instead , I realized that fish knows what fish knows .
Because the reality of the <unk> is that if you <unk> the <unk> , so that " everything is possible to be <unk> . It <unk> the <unk> .
If you <unk> the <unk> in a way that you can <unk> the <unk> .
<unk> the <unk> , and <unk> the <unk> .
Everybody needs a <unk> .
This is almost certainly too <unk> , maybe even for the fish , and certainly for us .
But the <unk> of some <unk> <unk> is a <unk> for <unk> and , for <unk> .
Thank you .
