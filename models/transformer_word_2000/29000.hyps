<unk> year I showed these <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> , which for almost three million years has had the size of the United States <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> 40 percent .
I 'm going to <unk> this <unk> of the problem because it doesn 't show the ice <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> is , in a way , the heart <unk> of global warming system .
They <unk> in summer .
The next <unk> will be a <unk> <unk> on the last 25 years .
<unk> <unk> are <unk> in red .
As you see , it <unk> up to the blue <unk> .
That 's the ice in <unk> , which is the ice summer .
You can see that the <unk> ice <unk> , of five years or more , it 's like blood , which here <unk> from the body .
It 's been <unk> for so , in 25 years .
This is a problem because the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> around the ocean <unk> , where there are huge <unk> of <unk> that , <unk> , <unk> , are <unk> in <unk> .
<unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , which <unk> <unk> could <unk> , that <unk> <unk> .
In some <unk> , you 're <unk> in the <unk> , the <unk> is already <unk> by the water .
The <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> ! <unk> : You 're doing it . The question is if we <unk> it .
A reason is that this <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> .
This is a river in <unk> <unk> .
<unk> had never <unk> <unk> <unk> .
This is the <unk> river in the <unk> of <unk> .
If you want to know how the <unk> <unk> to the sea level to the <unk> of the <unk> on <unk> , here is where the sea .
These <unk> are <unk> <unk> .
On the other part of the planet : <unk> , the largest <unk> ice on the planet .
<unk> month , the <unk> scientists that the ice <unk> is in <unk> , and that Western <unk> , which <unk> <unk> on some <unk> <unk> , is particularly <unk> in <unk> .
<unk> at <unk> feet of the <unk> , like in <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , the largest <unk> of ice , you see new <unk> , which a few years ago were <unk> .
<unk> percent of the world 's population <unk> <unk> by the <unk> water .
<unk> <unk> : This <unk> is the source of <unk> water in this city .
<unk> is <unk> .
But when you <unk> , the same happens to the <unk> water .
<unk> <unk> <unk> is 40 percent .
<unk> <unk> are in crisis .
<unk> , as you read , are <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> in the world <unk> to a <unk> increase in <unk> .
<unk> <unk> are <unk> to a <unk> out of the normal and <unk> .
<unk> times more <unk> in the last 30 years of the <unk> <unk> .
This is a <unk> of all <unk> .
If you look at it in the <unk> context , if you can see it in the <unk> .
In the last five years we 've <unk> 70 million <unk> of CO2 every 24 hours -- 25 million <unk> in the oceans .
Look at <unk> <unk> , <unk> , from <unk> , to <unk> , and on both <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> , where there is a <unk> <unk> of oxygen in the ocean .
<unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> is a problem , and <unk> is even worse .
The United States is one of the two countries with the <unk> emissions , together to China .
And it 's <unk> to build a lot of other <unk> .
But we 're <unk> to a <unk> of direction .
These are the projects <unk> in the last few years and some <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
<unk> , at any way , there 's a political <unk> in our country .
<unk> <unk> and <unk> have <unk> million dollars in the last year to <unk> <unk> <unk> , which is a <unk> .
I 'm going to give you something --
<unk> <unk> , where I live , there was a <unk> of <unk> billion <unk> of <unk> .
<unk> you saw it on the <unk> .
This is the second largest flow of <unk> in America .
It 's been around <unk> .
<unk> <unk> of one of <unk> <unk> was this .
<unk> : <unk> ♫ ♫ <unk> the <unk> is a <unk> and happy guy .
It 's <unk> here in America , and it <unk> our economy .
<unk> <unk> is <unk> .
It 's <unk> , <unk> and <unk> <unk> the <unk> .
Al <unk> : From here is a lot of <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The largest <unk> society is <unk> <unk> . This is his <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> : <unk> <unk> -- Al <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> -- don 't know what they 're talking .
<unk> : So the <unk> for the <unk> of <unk> has <unk> two <unk> .
This is one of them , a part .
<unk> : <unk> : <unk> we see <unk> change as a <unk> <unk> in our business .
So , that 's why we have a great amount of money in a <unk> <unk> to make public and <unk> the truth of <unk> .
Actually , <unk> is not <unk> .
We think it 's <unk> -- it 's also good <unk> .
So we don 't know about climate change .
We want to do it .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> -- you 've heard about it very much .
So it <unk> a <unk> in a structure of the <unk> , as <unk> is about <unk> .
<unk> ! The machines are a little <unk> , but this is the sound of the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> is between the main <unk> of global warming , but the <unk> technology <unk> that you see everything .
Let 's look at : this is the <unk> technology .
Al <unk> : <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to the economic issue and the national security .
<unk> : <unk> : America is in the crisis ; the national security crisis .
The <unk> that the <unk> all : our <unk> from the <unk> <unk> , like <unk> and oil <unk> .
But now , there 's a new , <unk> solution to <unk> .
<unk> America : 100 percent of <unk> energy , in 10 years .
A plan to <unk> America at work , more <unk> , and help <unk> global warming .
<unk> , a solution that we 're going to solve our problems .
<unk> America . <unk> more .
Al <unk> : This is the last .
<unk> : <unk> : It 's about <unk> energy to America .
One of the most <unk> ways of <unk> to <unk> from the <unk> that <unk> our planet .
<unk> : The future is here . <unk> , <unk> , <unk> new <unk> network .
<unk> <unk> 2 : <unk> <unk> for jobs
<unk> : <unk> America . It 's time to be <unk> .
<unk> : A old <unk> <unk> says , " If you want to go <unk> , go for yourself .
If you want to go far , go together . "
We have to go far away , quickly .
Thank you very much .
<unk> year at TED I did a <unk> on <unk> .
And I 'm going to try to <unk> about how the machine works .
So , here we go . And for those that the other time were , the <unk> is the largest scientific experiment that ever <unk> -- <unk> miles of <unk> .
<unk> is to <unk> the conditions that were in the <unk> of the universe -- to <unk> million times a second from the universe -- to <unk> million times a second .
All of that is just <unk> .
This is the machine under the <unk> .
They <unk> these <unk> <unk> into the <unk> .
This is what I work . It 's called <unk> -- it 's <unk> feet <unk> .
This is a <unk> image of <unk> <unk> in . You can see the <unk> .
<unk> <unk> last year , we <unk> the machine for the first time .
And this picture was taken by <unk> .
It was of <unk> <unk> in control room .
It 's a picture of the <unk> of particles that had made all the <unk> , <unk> in <unk> , with a part of the <unk> , and we <unk> , with <unk> , with <unk> , and <unk> particles inside the <unk> .
In other words , when you look at that image 10 <unk> , you know that the machine is a big <unk> .
I don 't know if it was this to <unk> us more or this , when someone <unk> on Google and <unk> that page was this .
That means that we 've had a <unk> impact beyond that scientific .
<unk> a week later , there was a problem with the machine , because of the <unk> here -- these <unk> <unk> .
These <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> when the machine works at the <unk> of the <unk> .
Now , the <unk> between you will <unk> the <unk> and <unk> , " It 's not true . I 'm too <unk> . "
And they can do it because when they 're very <unk> <unk> <unk> .
So , at least <unk> degrees <unk> , to a temperature <unk> to the stars , these <unk> can bring that <unk> .
In one of the <unk> of the most of <unk> <unk> in the <unk> , there was a <unk> <unk> .
So the <unk> <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
This was the result .
Now , this is even more <unk> if you think that these <unk> <unk> more than 20 <unk> , and that 's about 30 <unk> .
They <unk> about 50 <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , what we did .
We have <unk> them and <unk> .
They 're all <unk> to their <unk> .
<unk> the end of <unk> the <unk> will be again .
We <unk> it , and we <unk> to get data data to <unk> or <unk> , and so on our <unk> to find out what are the universe is .
Now , of course , in a way , these <unk> <unk> the <unk> of science and engineering engineering <unk> . It 's easy to <unk> .
I think that it 's so hard , the fact that we go beyond <unk> , I think that 's the value of things like <unk> .
I want to end with the words of a <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , who , in <unk> <unk> of <unk> experiments of his <unk> , his <unk> was Michael <unk> , said , " It 's so <unk> to progress in the human mind as <unk> that the ideas of science are <unk> , that there are not <unk> in nature , that there are not <unk> in nature , that there are no new <unk> by <unk> . "
Thank you .
I want to start with <unk> to <unk> to when , as children , <unk> <unk> .
<unk> like <unk> and <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , and <unk> , in fact , to think and <unk> problems .
<unk> <unk> is <unk> <unk> to the way that we <unk> most of the world around us .
So , as a <unk> <unk> from the <unk> of our <unk> with objects , together to my <unk> <unk> , and I started <unk> , I started <unk> , " And if we use a computer , instead of having the only <unk> of the <unk> as a digital <unk> that <unk> on a <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> an information with both hands ,
and <unk> to our <unk> ?
The question was so interesting that I decided to try to explore the answer , building <unk> .
In a few words , a <unk> is a <unk> computer as a <unk> .
In a few words , a <unk> is a <unk> computer as a <unk> .
You can <unk> them with the hand , they can <unk> together , feel the <unk> movement and they have a screen and have a <unk> radio <unk> .
But <unk> , they 're <unk> objects , like <unk> , you can just <unk> <unk> .
<unk> are the <unk> of a new <unk> for <unk> information .
And as they become more <unk> , <unk> of the movement , <unk> of others , and as they become more <unk> , <unk> of the <unk> , <unk> of the other , how we can <unk> them , and <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Let 's just start with some simple example .
This <unk> is <unk> to show up to : if you <unk> it in a direction , the video will be able to show them on the other side .
These <unk> <unk> are <unk> of others .
If you <unk> them , you 're going to <unk> what they 're around .
If they 're <unk> , <unk> and they can <unk> it a little bit .
If they 're <unk> , <unk> and they can <unk> it a little bit .
They also <unk> their movement and <unk> .
We 've then <unk> that one of the interesting <unk> of the <unk> was to be able to use <unk> on the data , for example , <unk> , which is a color .
In this case , we have three <unk> <unk> as a <unk> <unk> , and I can <unk> it to <unk> in the <unk> , where they <unk> .
and I can <unk> it to <unk> in the <unk> , where you 're <unk> .
If we get too much , we can <unk> it up a little bit .
There are also <unk> possibilities to <unk> , like <unk> , and <unk> , where people can try things things , and they <unk> the results from the <unk> , and they <unk> away .
Now I 'm --
This is a <unk> sequence I do with a <unk> program .
Here we have a <unk> of words that are in half <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> , every <unk> <unk> a letter on every <unk> , <unk> , every <unk> , <unk> , every <unk> <unk> a letter on every <unk> , and while I was doing this , and as I was <unk> by <unk> him , he <unk> on a <unk> .
Then , after about 30 seconds , you get , and you have a new <unk> of <unk> and new <unk> to try .
Thank you .
There are some <unk> children in <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> , I made it so that I <unk> them and I <unk> a video .
They 're very <unk> .
And one of the interesting things like this , you don 't have to give people a lot of <unk> .
I just said , " I 'm going to <unk> , and they know exactly what to do .
There 's other people who <unk> it .
This is our <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , there .
It really wanted to <unk> .
They were just <unk> , for him .
Now , this is a <unk> of a <unk> <unk> .
We had to build a <unk> for the <unk> . He 's <unk> .
It can <unk> new characters in the scene , <unk> their <unk> .
It can <unk> new characters in the scene , <unk> their <unk> .
Here 's , it 's getting out of the sun .
<unk> : The sun is <unk> .
David <unk> : Now he 's taken a <unk> in the scene .
<unk> : The <unk> <unk> .
<unk> ! Yeah !
So , you get the <unk> and <unk> can <unk> the characters --
<unk> : <unk> !
-- I 'll tell your story .
<unk> : <unk> !
<unk> : It 's a story with the open , and it can decide how it 's going to be <unk> .
<unk> : It 's a story with the open , and it can decide how it 's going to be <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> away , <unk> .
<unk> : The last example I have time I have time to show you is a recent <unk> , and <unk> and <unk> music .
it 's a recent <unk> , which is a recent <unk> and <unk> music .
<unk> here <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> of these has four different <unk> , and you can choose which to use .
You can also <unk> these <unk> in a sequence of <unk> to your <unk> .
And they just <unk> a <unk> sound and a sequence .
These are effects that you can <unk> in , like <unk> and <unk> .
I 'm going to <unk> it up to a particular sound and then <unk> it .
And then there are the effects of <unk> and <unk> , which <unk> to the entire sequence .
<unk> how it works .
<unk> : <unk> : <unk> <unk> a <unk> in two <unk> <unk> , " <unk> in a series , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> ,
Now you 're going to take a <unk> line .
<unk> : <unk> : Now you 're going to <unk> --
<unk> : <unk> : And now I 'm going to <unk> the <unk> , so I can control the effect of the live .
<unk> : <unk> : I can <unk> the entire sequence time on one side or on the other .
<unk> : <unk> : And now we 're going to get more <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> : I can <unk> the sequence of " flight . "
So I don 't have to <unk> before , but I can <unk> it , it 's going to be <unk> , <unk> .
And now , finally , I can <unk> the whole <unk> sequence on the left the <unk> " <unk> . "
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is to build new <unk> <unk> <unk> more <unk> to how our brain work and body .
And today , I 've had time to show you one of the results of this path , and some <unk> that we 're trying to bring out of the lab .
The concept that I want to <unk> is that it 's <unk> this new generation of objects to <unk> the <unk> media , which <unk> information in our world in the way we want .
Thank you very much .
I don 't see the time to speak to all of you .
I 'm a <unk> .
<unk> books is my <unk> , but it 's more than that , of course .
It 's also love and <unk> of my life .
And I don 't expect that it can change .
But , said , this , something that happened happened in my life and in my career , which led me to <unk> the whole relationship with this job .
The particular thing is that I <unk> wrote this book , this <unk> called " <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
And the result is that everywhere I 'm <unk> now , people <unk> me as if I was <unk> .
<unk> -- <unk> , <unk> !
I 'm going to get to me now and they 're saying , " You don 't fear that we 're not going to do it better ?
You don 't fear to keep writing for the whole life that can <unk> to someone ? "
<unk> that can <unk> to someone ? "
It 's <unk> , you know .
But it could go worse , except that I remember more than 20 years ago , when I was saying people -- I was a <unk> -- I wanted to be a <unk> .
I 'm going to talk to the <unk> <unk> .
And people say , " Don 't you feel that I don 't have successful ?
You don 't fear that the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> you ?
You don 't fear to do this <unk> for the whole life without anything that anything you 've ever come out and die on a <unk> of <unk> with the mouth full of <unk> <unk> 's mouth with the full of <unk> <unk> ?
So , you know .
The answer -- the short answer to all these questions is , " Yeah . "
Yeah , I 'm afraid of all those things .
I 've always had fear .
And I fear of a lot of other things that people couldn 't <unk> .
Like <unk> and <unk> other things .
But , I 'm going to talk about what I thought and <unk> is why ?
Is it <unk> ?
It 's <unk> that anybody who <unk> <unk> to be <unk> by a job that you feel like <unk> to do .
But what 's so particular in the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to <unk> health care about a <unk> that other <unk> don 't do ?
Like my father , for example , he was a <unk> <unk> and I didn 't remember one time in his <unk> of the <unk> where he was asked if he was afraid to be <unk> ?
<unk> 't it -- that <unk> of the <unk> John , how does it go ?
<unk> 't you that way , <unk> ?
<unk> , engineers <unk> as a group of certainly <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
We <unk> , we have enough this <unk> , and not only <unk> but <unk> all kinds of <unk> , we have this <unk> to be <unk> <unk> .
And it doesn 't look at the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> that , only in the <unk> century , <unk> young and often for them .
And the ones that don 't <unk> seem to be really <unk> by their <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , before you die in the last <unk> said , " Every <unk> my book <unk> me a little bit more extraordinary <unk> about the work of his life .
But we don 't know that , when we 're saying , because we 've heard these things so long that somehow we have <unk> and <unk> that creativity is and <unk> that creativity is and <unk> in some way <unk> and <unk> and that art , at the end , and it 's always <unk> .
And the question I want to <unk> to everybody here is : are you <unk> with this idea ?
All right now , that 's all about this thing -- because <unk> from a <unk> distance to me .
I think it 's <unk> .
And I think it 's <unk> , and I don 't want to <unk> in the next century .
I think it 's better to <unk> our big <unk> to live .
And certainly I know that , in my case -- it would be very <unk> to start <unk> to that <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> the <unk> in which I 'm in my career .
<unk> -- look <unk> , I 'm pretty young , I have about 40 years .
I still have about four <unk> of work in me .
And it 's very <unk> that anything that 's going to happen in the world as the work that <unk> after the <unk> success of my last book .
<unk> <unk> , because we 're all about friends here -- is <unk> that my greatest success is my greatest success is to my <unk> .
Oh , <unk> , <unk> .
You know , that 's the kind of <unk> that leads a person to start <unk> <unk> to nine to the morning nine of the morning and I don 't want to do it .
I love to continue doing this work that I love .
So , the question becomes , how ?
And so it seems to me , after many <unk> , that the way to work on is to create a <unk> <unk> , OK ?
I have to get a <unk> distance between me , which I 'm <unk> , and the natural <unk> on what the <unk> <unk> that wrote . And as I was going to get it . And as I was trying to find out through time , trying to find other societies , to find other society to find other societies to be able to find other societies to see if you have better ideas and more <unk>
about how to help people <unk> <unk> <unk> of creativity .
And that research has taken me to the <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> because they <unk> in <unk> and <unk> back .
<unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> -- people don 't believe that creativity from men , OK ?
It <unk> that creativity was this <unk> spirit and <unk> to men from some <unk> <unk> and <unk> to men and <unk> , for reasons and <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> <unk> these <unk> <unk> of creativity " <unk> . "
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> to have a <unk> that <unk> <unk> from <unk> .
<unk> were the same idea , but <unk> that species of spirit without a <unk> .
which is <unk> , because <unk> don 't really feel that a <unk> was a particularly <unk> somebody .
I thought a <unk> was this sort of <unk> <unk> that <unk> literally <unk> in the <unk> of the study of an artist , a little artist like the <unk> <unk> , and that <unk> out of <unk> the work of the artist 's work and <unk> the result of that work .
<unk> <unk> <unk> you , that 's the distance I 'm talking -- that <unk> <unk> that <unk> you from your <unk> .
And everybody thought that was so that you were , right ?
So the <unk> artists were <unk> by <unk> things , like the too <unk> , you know ?
If your work was <unk> , you didn 't get the <unk> , everybody <unk> that was <unk> by this <unk> <unk> .
If your work <unk> , it wasn 't all your <unk> , you ?
Everybody <unk> that was your <unk> to be a <unk> .
And so people are <unk> <unk> creativity in <unk> for a long time .
Then the <unk> <unk> and all <unk> , and we <unk> this great idea ; we put the human being in the center of the universe and the <unk> and the <unk> and without more to <unk> space <unk> that <unk> <unk> from <unk> .
This was the <unk> principle , and people began to think that creativity was <unk> completely from <unk> .
And for the first time in history , it <unk> to <unk> this or that artist as a <unk> <unk> than a person with <unk> .
And I have to <unk> , I think that was a big <unk> .
I think you 're like a <unk> person , you know , a simple person to believe that they 're like a source , <unk> and <unk> of all the <unk> <unk> , <unk> and <unk> and <unk> is a <unk> responsibility to human <unk> .
It 's like to ask someone to <unk> the sun .
<unk> and <unk> completely the <unk> and <unk> all these <unk> <unk> on the <unk> .
And I think it 's been this pressure to <unk> artists in the <unk> 500 years .
And , if this is true , and I think it 's , the question is , the question becomes , and right now ?
Can we <unk> it ?
<unk> to go back to a more <unk> understanding of the relationship between human and <unk> <unk> .
Or maybe not .
Maybe we can 't <unk> 500 years of thinking in an <unk> talk .
And there 's probably people in the audience who <unk> <unk> <unk> on the <unk> , <unk> , do <unk> , you <unk> people <unk> <unk> on their projects .
You probably don 't <unk> all about this thing .
But the question I 'd like to ask you is -- why not ?
Why don 't we <unk> this way ?
Because it has more than anything else I 've ever heard about the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> process .
A process that , as anyone who 's ever <unk> to do something -- so basically , everybody here -- knows , you know , you don 't <unk> <unk> .
And in fact , it 's a completely <unk> .
I 've been <unk> this <unk> with the extraordinary <unk> <unk> , which has now 90 years , but that was a <unk> for all life and said that during his <unk> <unk> , <unk> out in the <unk> <unk> , <unk> out in the <unk> <unk> , and <unk> it , in if , a <unk> <unk> from <unk> .
He said it was like a <unk> <unk> in the air .
And that <unk> <unk> to her from <unk> .
And he <unk> it to it , because he was <unk> the land under his feet .
I was <unk> to have one thing to do at that point and was , words , " <unk> as a <unk> . "
And so it was <unk> to the house and it was <unk> by this <unk> , and it wouldn 't have to do anything that take a piece of paper and a <unk> enough <unk> , and <unk> on the page .
Sometimes I couldn 't get enough enough , so <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> without being able to get them in the house and she would <unk> through and she would <unk> it through and she would <unk> to <unk> through the <unk> , and she would <unk> to <unk> through the <unk> , and she would have another <unk> . "
Then those times -- this piece never <unk> it -- there were no <unk> of times when it was almost <unk> , OK ?
So , he was <unk> at home and he was looking for for the <unk> and the <unk> through , and he <unk> a <unk> right in the while he was <unk> , and then he was like if he <unk> with the other hand and <unk> .
<unk> the <unk> from the tail and <unk> into his body and the <unk> on the page .
And in these cases , the <unk> would have to <unk> on the <unk> page and <unk> but <unk> , the <unk> <unk> to the first one .
So when the <unk> <unk> -- it 's <unk> , it 's <unk> to my <unk> process .
Not the whole <unk> process -- I 'm not a <unk> !
I 'm a <unk> , and my way of <unk> is ; I 'm going to <unk> every day and work and work on top .
But even me in my <unk> , I <unk> against that thing , sometimes .
And I 'm sure many of you would have it .
You know , even if the work and ideas <unk> me from a certain source , I couldn 't <unk> it .
And what is this thing ?
And how can we <unk> it in it <unk> that we don 't lose your head , but rather , that <unk> us <unk> ?
As I 'm <unk> , the best example I have is the <unk> <unk> <unk> , which I have been <unk> <unk> for a <unk> .
<unk> to this , and you know , <unk> , for the <unk> of life was the <unk> of the <unk> artist <unk> , trying to control , <unk> , <unk> these <unk> <unk> <unk> completely <unk> .
But then <unk> , he <unk> , he was <unk> on a <unk> <unk> <unk> , he was <unk> on a <unk> <unk> , he <unk> it all <unk> for him .
It 's fast and everything of a <unk> , this little <unk> of <unk> , which is in his head as the <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , and the <unk> , and the <unk> , and the <unk> , but he doesn 't know how to <unk> .
It doesn 't have a piece of paper , it doesn 't have a <unk> .
So he starts to feel this <unk> species that I 'm going to grow in him , like , " I 'm going to lose , and <unk> <unk> from this <unk> song .
I 'm not <unk> enough , and I can 't <unk> it . "
And instead of going to <unk> , they <unk> .
<unk> the whole process of <unk> and did something completely new .
I just got to the sky and said , " <unk> , don 't you see that I 'm <unk> ? "
" Do you seem to write a song now ? "
If you really want to <unk> , you 're in a <unk> moment when I can take care of you .
<unk> , <unk> to <unk> more <unk> .
I 'm going to <unk> <unk> <unk> . "
And his <unk> process after this .
Not the work , the work was still <unk> .
But the process , and the <unk> <unk> that <unk> was <unk> when <unk> the <unk> , the <unk> that <unk> out of him , he <unk> , he <unk> that he had to be a <unk> thing , and <unk> <unk> back .
but I was <unk> this <unk> , wonderful <unk> <unk> a conversation with <unk> and this thing <unk> and <unk> that but it wasn 't <unk> .
So , how I <unk> that story is to change a little bit , the way I 'm <unk> and already <unk> me once .
This idea , I was <unk> when I was <unk> , " <unk> , <unk> , " and I 'm going to go into one of the <unk> <unk> in which we 're all working on something and we don 't really get a <unk> , that 's going to be the <unk> , that 's going to be the <unk> , that 's going to be the <unk> book .
Not only <unk> , their <unk> book .
And we start thinking about <unk> this project .
But then I 'm going to try to <unk> that <unk> air and <unk> .
So I <unk> my face on the <unk> and I <unk> my <unk> to a <unk> <unk> of the room .
And I said , " <unk> , what , both of us , and we know that if this book is not going to be <unk> my , don 't it ?
Because as you see I 'm <unk> everything I have , I don 't have more of this .
So if you want it to be better , you have to <unk> and do your part .
OK . But if you don 't do that , you know what , I don 't .
I started to write the same because it 's my job .
And I 'd like you to <unk> that I 'm <unk> to do my part " Because it 's so , it 's so , OK -- <unk> does it in the <unk> Africa of the North Africa <unk> people <unk> to <unk> the <unk> of the moon , <unk> music forward for hours to <unk> .
And they were always <unk> , because the <unk> were <unk> and they were <unk> .
But every once in a lot , <unk> , something <unk> , and one of these <unk> artists actually <unk> .
And I know you know what I 'm talking about , because I know you 've all seen , at some point , a <unk> like that .
It was like the time , and the <unk> <unk> through a kind of <unk> and he wasn 't doing anything different from <unk> , like <unk> <unk> before , but everything was doing .
And all of a sudden , they don 't just like a human .
But it <unk> up and <unk> <unk> in the fire of the <unk> .
And when this <unk> , back to the time , people <unk> what was , he <unk> it with his name .
<unk> your hands and <unk> to <unk> , " <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , God , God . "
That 's God , you know .
<unk> <unk> -- when the <unk> <unk> <unk> , they <unk> this <unk> with them and the <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> , " <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , " <unk> , " which you can still feel in the <unk> or in the <unk> .
In <unk> , when an artist did something impossible and <unk> , " <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , " <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , " <unk> , <unk> -- a <unk> of God .
And it 's <unk> because we need it .
But , the problem comes the next day , for the <unk> itself , when you <unk> and <unk> that are 11 of the <unk> <unk> and <unk> of God , there is no more .
It 's just a <unk> with a great deal of <unk> , and maybe you never get to the <unk> .
And maybe nobody <unk> the name of God <unk> as I <unk> , and what 's going to do with the rest of his life ?
It 's hard .
This is one of the most <unk> <unk> to do in a <unk> life .
But maybe it doesn 't have to be so <unk> if you can 't believe , <unk> , that the most <unk> <unk> of your being come from yourself .
But just <unk> that you 're just <unk> that you get data into a <unk> source of this <unk> part of your life that you have to go to <unk> .
And , you know , if we think it all change .
And so I started <unk> , and it 's certainly how I <unk> it for several months in the <unk> of the book that I was <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> of my success .
And what I have to continue <unk> when I feel from this is , I don 't fear .
You don 't <unk> . You just have your work .
<unk> to <unk> for your side , any can be .
If your work is <unk> , you get it .
If you <unk> , you 're going to get <unk> <unk> <unk> some <unk> <unk> , for one moment through your <unk> , " then you 're <unk> ! "
<unk> , you do the same your <unk> .
And " <unk> ! " You 're going to your same .
I think that , and I think it 's <unk> .
" <unk> ! " <unk> ! " You know , even for having had love human and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Thank you .
Thank you .
<unk> <unk> : <unk> !
As you know , I 've already talked about some of these projects on the human genome , what it can <unk> and the discovery of genes .
We 're going to <unk> a new path . We 've started <unk> biology and now starting from that digital code , we 're <unk> in a new <unk> of biology , and <unk> life .
We always tried to ask the big questions .
" What is life ? " It 's something that many <unk> , I think have <unk> to understand at various levels .
We 've been trying to <unk> , <unk> to the <unk> terms .
We 're <unk> for almost 20 years .
When we <unk> the human genome <unk> to go to the human biology world of the computer biology .
Now , we can <unk> life , or create new life life from this digital universe ?
This is a map of a little <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , which is the species from the <unk> genome of the <unk> of the <unk> that can <unk> in the lab .
And we tried to reduce the genome to <unk> a even smaller one more small .
We can <unk> a <unk> of <unk> of genes about 500 than 500 than 500 of them .
But when we take a look at his map , it 's <unk> simple than our .
<unk> , this is simple .
But when we look at all the genes that we can <unk> , one at the time , is very <unk> that this can bring to a <unk> cell .
So I thought the only way to <unk> this <unk> was <unk> this <unk> so that we could <unk> the <unk> to <unk> some of these questions .
And so we started the <unk> of " Can we <unk> a <unk> ? "
Can the chemistry <unk> that we have these big molecules that we 've never been able to do before we 've never been able to do before ,
And , in case , can we make a <unk> ?
A <unk> is just a piece of <unk> <unk> material .
The speed with which we 're able to <unk> life is <unk> to <unk> <unk> .
Our ability to write the code , instead of <unk> , but it 's <unk> .
And our <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> .
We 've been over 15 years ago .
The process has <unk> a lot of <unk> , <unk> with a <unk> <unk> before we <unk> the early experiments .
But we found that DNA <unk> is very difficult .
There are thousands of cars in the world that <unk> small <unk> of DNA , of <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , and it 's a <unk> process . It 's more <unk> is <unk> , <unk> .
So we had to develop a new <unk> to <unk> these <unk> and <unk> the <unk> .
And this was our first <unk> , starting from digital information of <unk> <unk> genome .
It 's a little virus that bacteria <unk> .
We designed <unk> , <unk> the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> a DNA <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
The interesting part is when we have taken this piece of <unk> material <unk> and <unk> it in bacteria , the bacteria have <unk> to read this code , and <unk> particles .
<unk> particles have <unk> back , and they <unk> back , and they <unk> the <unk> <unk> .
I 've talked about recently with members of the <unk> industry that they certainly have <unk> this model .
They have more of you .
I think this is a situation where software can actually build his own <unk> in a <unk> system .
But we wanted to do the greatest things .
You could build the entire <unk> of <unk> .
They 're more than <unk> <unk> code .
So we thought we 're going to <unk> in the size of the <unk> of the <unk> , so that we can change the <unk> of a <unk> cell .
<unk> is <unk> , and if you <unk> information with <unk> into a computer , these must be very <unk> .
When we first <unk> this genome for the first time in <unk> , the standard <unk> was of a <unk> for every 10 <unk> <unk> .
We found , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> . If you <unk> that original sequence we never had able to do it work .
A part of the process is to design <unk> <unk> 50 <unk> that <unk> with all the other <unk> of 50 <unk> to build smaller <unk> <unk> that <unk> together .
It 's going to be <unk> here .
You probably read that you read about it .
<unk> <unk> : We have a <unk> code on four <unk> : A , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> of those <unk> <unk> together , <unk> about 20 <unk> , and there 's a <unk> order of <unk> for every <unk> .
So we can use the code for words , <unk> , <unk> .
What we 've done in the beginning was <unk> .
Some of them have been <unk> by the fact that it wasn 't <unk> .
We designed these <unk> to just <unk> <unk> with <unk> .
There are <unk> that we <unk> them and <unk> them .
And we started <unk> parts , <unk> with <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to them , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
We made these <unk> <unk> in <unk> so that we made in <unk> so that we 're trying to create a very <unk> <unk> <unk> , as you 'll see in a minute .
We 're trying to <unk> the process .
So , this seems to be the <unk> of a <unk> .
When you get these <unk> <unk> , we get more than 100 <unk> , you don 't get to the <unk> <unk> .
You get to the <unk> of <unk> biology .
So we have other <unk> .
<unk> of another <unk> called <unk> <unk> , which in biology <unk> to <unk> DNA <unk> to <unk> DNA <unk> .
Here 's an example .
This <unk> , called <unk> <unk> , can <unk> three million <unk> of <unk> .
You can see in the <unk> <unk> as his <unk> is <unk> .
In 12 -- it 's been <unk> exactly as it was before .
<unk> thousands of organisms that can do that .
These organisms can completely <unk> .
You have to live under <unk> .
I 'm absolutely sure that life <unk> in space , and it <unk> to find new <unk> of water <unk> .
Actually , NASA <unk> that this happens .
This is a picture of the <unk> that we 've built these <unk> , just using these <unk> , just using these <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> them .
This image was not <unk> with a <unk> <unk> , but with a <unk> <unk> .
It 's such a <unk> that we can <unk> with a <unk> <unk> .
These are pictures that <unk> a period of about six seconds .
This is the <unk> that we 've done a little bit of time ago .
They 're more than <unk> code code .
It 's the largest <unk> of a <unk> structure ever <unk> by man .
It 's got a <unk> weight to 300 million .
If you <unk> it with a <unk> 10 <unk> , we 'll take pages to <unk> this code .
Now , how do we make it work ? How can we <unk> it ?
Of course , you know , you 're a <unk> <unk> .
It 's a little bit more <unk> when you use bacteria .
It 's easier even when it comes from <unk> cells , like , you can just <unk> the <unk> and <unk> another , which is that basically the <unk> of <unk> .
In <unk> <unk> , the <unk> is <unk> inside the cell , but we have <unk> <unk> that we are able to do a <unk> <unk> of a cell to another cell <unk> from another cell to <unk> and <unk> .
We <unk> a <unk> <unk> from a species .
<unk> are different than men from <unk> .
We 've <unk> some <unk> in more <unk> that we can decide what this <unk> .
He <unk> it with the <unk> so that they <unk> all the <unk> .
And when we put it in the cell was <unk> and <unk> our <unk> , the new <unk> went to the cell <unk> , he went into the cell .
And we would say that we don 't have to go beyond , but we tried still <unk> in <unk> there .
This is one of the major <unk> of evolution .
We found that <unk> species have <unk> a second or a third <unk> somewhere , <unk> in a second thousands of new <unk> to that species .
So who thinks about evolution as a <unk> only <unk> at the time you <unk> has no <unk> of biology .
We have <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> DNA .
The <unk> that was in the cell didn 't <unk> one .
The <unk> <unk> that we <unk> <unk> .
It 's <unk> , and he <unk> the other <unk> as a <unk> material , <unk> it , and we <unk> with only cell and the new <unk> .
It 's become blue blue because of the genes that we 've <unk> .
And in a short <unk> of time , all of the <unk> of a species are <unk> , and it <unk> of everything in a new species , <unk> on the new software that we 've <unk> in the cell .
All the <unk> are <unk> , the <unk> are <unk> , and when you <unk> the code <unk> , they <unk> exactly what we 've <unk> you .
Now , this could be <unk> <unk> , but it <unk> the software , we can change things in a pretty <unk> .
Now , I 've already <unk> that this is not talking about <unk> -- but in progress from three million years and a half million years , and I 've already told that maybe we 're about to create a new version of the <unk> <unk> that we <unk> new new <unk> <unk> new new <unk> <unk> on this process .
Why do that ?
I think it 's pretty <unk> when we think of our <unk> .
We 're going to go from six and a half billion people in the next 40 years .
Just to give one example : I was born in <unk> .
Now there are three people on the planet to <unk> in <unk> ; in 40 years , there 's four .
We 're <unk> now to food now , <unk> water and <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> and <unk> it for six billion people .
I 'm going to get it for nine billion .
<unk> more than five billion <unk> , more than 30 billion <unk> .
That means 100 million <unk> a day .
When we try to find <unk> <unk> , or any kind of process to <unk> , it will be a huge challenge .
In more we have to realize that we have to realize all the CO2 <unk> from these materials that <unk> in the atmosphere .
<unk> today , because of <unk> <unk> in the world , we have a <unk> with about 20 million genes , and I like to think that are the <unk> <unk> for the future .
The industry <unk> only a <unk> about <unk> , and think about how many different things are out .
Our <unk> here is <unk> data from the <unk> reality and our imagination .
Now we have <unk> , because of these <unk> <unk> , able to create what we call <unk> <unk> .
We can make a big robot that can produce a million <unk> a day .
Think of <unk> these 20 million <unk> or <unk> to <unk> the <unk> to produce <unk> or <unk> , new <unk> , and we can change , because of a small team , and create more <unk> biology now that in the last 20 years of science .
And it 's just a standard <unk> .
We can choose to <unk> , <unk> <unk> , chemistry or <unk> , <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
This is a <unk> of some software <unk> that we 're working on to be able to <unk> and design and design species on the computer .
Well , we don 't know how they 're going to be .
We know exactly what their <unk> code is .
Now we 're <unk> on the <unk> generation .
You 've also seen that <unk> <unk> from <unk> was an experiment .
We have <unk> <unk> <unk> , which we 're going to <unk> enough enough to <unk> <unk> <unk> or different kinds of <unk> .
But the only way that biology can have a big impact without <unk> the cost of food and <unk> the <unk> would be <unk> CO2 in the dark matter before , we 're working on to design cells that we 're working in order to design that can achieve this purpose , and we can have the first <unk> <unk> in about 18 months .
<unk> <unk> with CO2 is a <unk> , but in our <unk> <unk> around the world , we found different <unk> .
This is a <unk> that we 've <unk> in <unk> .
It <unk> in the deep ocean , about <unk> feet deep deep deep into the water temperature .
<unk> <unk> from CO2 using hydrogen <unk> as hydrogen <unk> .
We 're trying to understand whether we can <unk> CO2 , which can easily be <unk> through <unk> , to drive this process .
So , we think we can be able to <unk> what the basic question of what is life is , we , we <unk> the <unk> goal of <unk> the whole industry .
<unk> . If you can 't do it from TED , where can you ?
It 's a main source of energy .
<unk> , we 're working for <unk> <unk> to create <unk> <unk> .
You 've seen this year with flu , we always are back a year and with a dollar in less when it comes to find the right .
I think what you can change by building <unk> in <unk> .
Here 's how the future could start to look <unk> , now , the tree of evolution , <unk> bacteria with <unk> , <unk> , and finally <unk> cells .
We 're so far from <unk> people .
Our goal is to make a long enough to try to <unk> it . Thank you very much .
First of all , I 'm going to show you , the <unk> possible , some fundamental work of the new technology that we 've taken to <unk> <unk> to a year ago . This is <unk> .
It 's a environment that you can <unk> in both at the local level that <unk> with a huge amount of data .
We 're seeing <unk> <unk> of <unk> photos with a kind of <unk> <unk> and <unk> , for a fast <unk> , <unk> the images we want .
And it doesn 't matter how big the amount of information that we see , how big it is these <unk> of data or images .
Most of them are common photographs , but this for example is a <unk> <unk> by the <unk> of <unk> , and <unk> in the <unk> of 300 <unk> .
It 's not any difference because the only thing that <unk> the <unk> of a system like this is the number of <unk> on your screen at any time . It 's also a very <unk> architecture .
This is a whole book , example of data , not of <unk> .
This is the <unk> <unk> of <unk> . Every <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And to <unk> that it 's really <unk> and not images , we can do something like that , to actually show it is a real <unk> of the text , not of a picture .
It could be a way to read a little <unk> book .
I don 't <unk> it .
This is a more <unk> example . This is a number of The <unk> .
Every big image is the beginning of a <unk> .
And it really gives you the pleasure and the beautiful experience of <unk> , or a <unk> , which is for nature a <unk> or a <unk> , which is for nature of a <unk> .
We 've also done something with the corner of this particular number of The <unk> .
We 've created a <unk> <unk> <unk> that you use in a normal <unk> , and we 've <unk> of the content content .
If you want to see the <unk> of this <unk> , you can see it here .
Or other models , or even <unk> <unk> .
And this really <unk> some of these ideas to <unk> the <unk> of space on the screen .
We think that <unk> to put in the <unk> and other <unk> , and <unk> other <unk> , and <unk> <unk> to be <unk> .
Of course , <unk> is one of the most <unk> <unk> for this kind of technology .
And I don 't want to lose time , if not to say that we have <unk> <unk> to give us <unk> to this field .
These are all the streets in the United States <unk> above an <unk> image of NASA .
So now we 're going to get something else .
This is actually live on the Web ; you can see it .
It 's a project called <unk> , which <unk> two different technologies .
One is <unk> and the other is a <unk> research that was very interesting that made by <unk> <unk> , a <unk> student of Washington , with the help of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> . A <unk> <unk> .
And it 's alive on the Web , <unk> <unk> .
You can see when we do this kind of <unk> , where we can go from an image to the other and have this kind of experience in <unk> .
But the <unk> <unk> of images here actually has a meaning .
<unk> <unk> <unk> , and these things were <unk> these pictures together , so that <unk> to the places that <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> on the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . <unk> have been <unk> . And so here you see some of a <unk> <unk> , and these things were all <unk> at the <unk> level .
I don 't know if I have time to show you some other environment .
There are a lot more <unk> .
I want to go directly to one of the <unk> data and this <unk> from a <unk> <unk> <unk> that we 've done for the first time to show you what we 've done is really the key behind this technology , the <unk> technology , and <unk> technology . And it 's not <unk> by looking for the <unk> that we 've put in the website .
We had to <unk> some <unk> and <unk> and so on .
This is a <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> images of <unk> in <unk> , other <unk> , other <unk> <unk> and so on . <unk> of these <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , and so on . And so , you know , you know , this is a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
So they 're all <unk> images from <unk> and they were all <unk> on the <unk> level in this way .
And it 's possible to <unk> this <unk> way .
You know , I would never have thought of <unk> to work for <unk> .
It 's very <unk> to <unk> this kind of <unk> here .
I think we 're going to see that it 's a lot of different types of <unk> : from the cell phones to those <unk> <unk> , a <unk> number , <unk> in this environment .
And if I can , I can , I get <unk> to the <unk> ones .
Many are <unk> by <unk> , etc .
There 's a series of photographs here -- <unk> .
This is a <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> .
We can go from <unk> to <unk> physics of this environment .
The <unk> point is that we can do things with social environment . This is now <unk> data from the whole memory of how to <unk> the earth , from the <unk> of <unk> <unk> and <unk> all that data together .
All those pictures become <unk> together , greater than the <unk> of the parts .
You have a model of the whole <unk> .
Think about this as the <unk> of the <unk> 's work on Earth <unk> .
It 's something that we <unk> in complexity as people <unk> it , and the <unk> that you 're going to <unk> it with the use .
Their pictures are <unk> with <unk> <unk> by other people .
If someone comes the idea of <unk> all these <unk> <unk> the name , my <unk> picture of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> of all those data , and I can use it as a <unk> point to <unk> in that space , using the pictures of anyone , and have a social experience <unk> and <unk> .
Of course , a <unk> of all this is <unk> models of every interesting part of the Earth , <unk> not just by <unk> <unk> and <unk> and <unk> , but from <unk> .
Thank you very much .
Chris Anderson : I understand ? What your software will take on doing is that at some point , in the next few years , all of the photographs that we 're going to get together ?
<unk> : Yeah . What 's doing is basically finding out .
It 's creating <unk> , if you want , between images to images .
And it 's <unk> to the content of images .
What it becomes very interesting if you think about the <unk> of information that many of these <unk> images .
As you do a <unk> of images on the Web , you <unk> a <unk> and the text on the page has a lot of information about images .
Now , what happens if that picture <unk> to all your pictures of your pictures ?
So the amount of <unk> <unk> and the amount of <unk> that <unk> is really huge . It 's a <unk> effect .
CA : <unk> , it 's really incredible . <unk> .
<unk> : I 'm going to you very much .
One of the main <unk> when you <unk> and one of the <unk> research is that that they can live between who has no <unk> <unk> , among who <unk> the past in the wind , the <unk> <unk> <unk> from <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of plants .
You might think that <unk> <unk> still <unk> beyond the <unk> <unk> , or the <unk> <unk> are still <unk> <unk> , or <unk> , <unk> <unk> still <unk> , or <unk> , to <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> , to remember the <unk> of the <unk> , and that the idea that the world in which we live in which , but is only a model of reality ,
the <unk> of a particular <unk> of <unk> choices that our <unk> has done , well or bad , many <unk> ago .
And , of course , everybody <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Everybody <unk> . <unk> <unk> .
We 're <unk> to <unk> <unk> .
We have to deal with the <unk> of death , so we don 't get it if we <unk> and <unk> --
We all have an art .
What <unk> is the <unk> of the song , the <unk> of every culture .
It doesn 't matter whether the <unk> <unk> <unk> , or the <unk> of <unk> , or the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , or the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , or a <unk> in the <unk> .
He was my <unk> of journey in <unk> a month ago , or a <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> 's mother of the world .
All these <unk> <unk> us that there are other ways of <unk> other ways of thinking , other ways of moving around the world .
And , if you take a moment , it 's a concept that can give you hope .
<unk> , the <unk> of <unk> <unk> of the world create a <unk> of life and <unk> that <unk> the planet and is important for the <unk> of the planet as the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And you can think of this <unk> <unk> as a <unk> , and you can <unk> the <unk> of all the <unk> , <unk> , dreams , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> in being by being by the <unk> of the human imagination of the <unk> .
<unk> is the <unk> of humanity 's great <unk> of humanity .
It 's the <unk> of what we are and what we can be as <unk> species .
And <unk> <unk> was <unk> <unk> <unk> was <unk> to <unk> and <unk> much <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , for example , <unk> that 50 percent of all species has been or is on the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the diversity -- and you don 't even get <unk> to the most <unk> -- in the field of the <unk> diversity -- and you don 't even get <unk> to the most <unk> <unk> -- that of the <unk> diversity .
The <unk> of this is , of course , the <unk> <unk> .
When you 're <unk> <unk> <unk> on this planet .
A language is not only <unk> by a <unk> or a series of rules .
A language is the <unk> of the human spirit .
It 's the medium that the <unk> of every culture comes in in the world .
Every language is a forest of mind , a <unk> , a thought , a <unk> of <unk> .
And of those <unk> <unk> , as we 're sitting here in <unk> , at least half is no more <unk> in the <unk> of children .
They 're no longer <unk> to children , which means less than <unk> something , they 're already dead .
What 's more <unk> than the <unk> , of being <unk> by the <unk> , of being the last to speak language , and not <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> or to <unk> the <unk> of <unk> or <unk> ?
This <unk> <unk> was the state of someone in the world every two weeks , every two weeks , every two weeks , a <unk> <unk> and <unk> with <unk> the <unk> of language .
And I know some of you might say , " <unk> 't it better ?
The world would not be a better place if we all use the same language ? " <unk> , so we 're all <unk> . <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> .
<unk> of a <unk> thing that means you can 't speak their language .
Today I 'd like to give you a journey through the <unk> --
a little journey in the <unk> to give you a <unk> of what we 're <unk> .
Many of us <unk> that when I say " different ways of <unk> . " I mean , really different ways of <unk> .
<unk> for example , this <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , the <unk> of <unk> , which <unk> to the <unk> <unk> from the <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
It 's a <unk> that 's not able to <unk> the blue color in the green because the <unk> <unk> is <unk> in the <unk> of the forest , which <unk> the <unk> .
They have a <unk> language and a <unk> rule , <unk> " <unk> <unk> " : you have to <unk> a person talking a different language .
All of that has <unk> in the past <unk> , but the <unk> is that in these <unk> families that you 're talking about six or seven <unk> <unk> <unk> nobody 's <unk> .
You get to hear and then we start talking .
<unk> one of the most interesting <unk> I 've lived , the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , an incredible <unk> that has had the first <unk> <unk> in <unk> .
In <unk> , five <unk> have <unk> contact a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
They 've done by the top pictures that <unk> them in the <unk> that <unk> <unk> , which this <unk> of the <unk> forest <unk> had never seen anything .
They <unk> the <unk> pictures , they 've <unk> them to <unk> a form or a <unk> , and they don 't know anything , they have <unk> that <unk> <unk> , and they <unk> the five <unk> with <unk> .
But <unk> not only <unk> <unk> .
They 're <unk> with each other .
<unk> percent <unk> <unk> was <unk> by themselves .
We 're <unk> eight <unk> and we found two natural <unk> and when we <unk> to know , they <unk> that one of them was <unk> that one of them was <unk> so that he died , and then <unk> it itself . <unk> , they had an incredible knowledge of the forest .
<unk> were able to recognize the animal <unk> from 40 <unk> and <unk> the species .
In the early <unk> , I was <unk> a really interesting task when my <unk> <unk> <unk> me if I wanted to go to <unk> in <unk> societies to the base of <unk> and <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and they used to <unk> <unk> .
To make sense of <unk> , I should understand culture and that <unk> is not <unk> <unk> .
It 's pretty much of a <unk> view of the world .
Very interesting .
If you <unk> to <unk> the big <unk> of the world , what <unk> me ?
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , etc .
A continent always comes out , thinking that <unk> Africa has not <unk> <unk> . And instead , and that 's not the <unk> of these <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> .
What makes it interesting is the <unk> of the <unk> of life and death .
So <unk> are <unk> the <unk> .
<unk> can be <unk> by the <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> live in such a way that for a moment a little <unk> the <unk> .
So , the <unk> <unk> <unk> go to <unk> to speak of God .
We <unk> in <unk> and <unk> God . "
And from the moment that you 're <unk> , is the spirit that <unk> you , how can you make it wrong ?
So , you 're <unk> to these incredible events : <unk> <unk> in the state of <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a rather <unk> of the power of the mind when it 's <unk> in a state of <unk> <unk> .
<unk> all the <unk> I 've lived with the most <unk> <unk> are the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , in the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> of <unk> civilization that once <unk> on the <unk> <unk> of <unk> in <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> on the <unk> <unk> .
In a <unk> continent , this <unk> never has been <unk> by <unk> .
<unk> today are <unk> by a <unk> , but their education is extraordinary .
<unk> <unk> are <unk> by <unk> to three or four , and they live in a world <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> for 18 years .
Two <unk> years of nine years <unk> on the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of the mother , now I <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> .
For all this time , they 're <unk> to the values of their society , values that <unk> their <unk> and only their <unk> <unk> <unk> -- or to say the <unk> <unk> .
The first time of this incredible <unk> , they 're <unk> out and for the first time in their life , at the age of 18 , see an <unk> . And in that moment of the first <unk> <unk> , when the sun <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , all they 've learned in the <unk> in his <unk> . <unk> does a <unk> <unk> in his <unk> . <unk> makes a <unk> <unk> , and says ,
" <unk> ? I 'm going to show you .
It 's <unk> . Now it 's <unk> to you . "
It 's a major <unk> and they say that we , <unk> <unk> , we are the <unk> of the world .
This level of <unk> is extremely important .
When we think about <unk> <unk> and the <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> <unk> , which is a concept in its <unk> or maybe <unk> <unk> and <unk> and say that these <unk> are <unk> <unk> to the Earth .
<unk> <unk> are not <unk> or <unk> by the <unk> .
There 's no space for these things in the <unk> <unk> or in the <unk> <unk> , but because of time and <unk> , they 've created a <unk> of the Earth <unk> , they 've created a <unk> of the Earth , but on a more <unk> <unk> : the concept that the Earth can live only because it 's <unk> by the human consciousness .
What does it mean ?
I mean that a <unk> of the <unk> that <unk> the mountain is a <unk> spirit that <unk> his <unk> will be <unk> human being <unk> <unk> different human being , and it 's going to be <unk> human being <unk> different . And it 's a <unk> of <unk> that <unk> that <unk> a mountain is a <unk> of <unk> to be <unk> .
which is a spirit of a spirit or a <unk> <unk> is <unk> .
What 's interesting is the <unk> that <unk> the relationship between <unk> and natural world .
I grew up in the <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> to be <unk> .
That made me a human being different from my <unk> friends who believe that <unk> are the <unk> of <unk> and the <unk> <unk> of <unk> and the <unk> <unk> that live in the <unk> <unk> of the world , <unk> that live in in the <unk> <unk> .
If we <unk> that these <unk> can actually create different , we could actually start understanding some of their <unk> <unk> . They <unk> this <unk> .
I <unk> this picture in <unk> in the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> some of you have heard about <unk> , the most powerful <unk> of the <unk> <unk> .
What makes <unk> is not the potential of <unk> , but his <unk> . It 's <unk> by two elements .
On one side , this <unk> <unk> that <unk> a series of <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
<unk> the only <unk> is a <unk> <unk> that <unk> a little bit of the <unk> , but it 's <unk> with a <unk> 's family <unk> said <unk> .
This <unk> <unk> <unk> , very similar to the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
If you ever see the <unk> <unk> on the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> that <unk> <unk> .
<unk> that <unk> on the <unk> is a little bit of how to be <unk> by a <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> on a sea of electricity . <unk> . <unk> 't create the <unk> of reality .
I often <unk> with my <unk> , Richard <unk> <unk> , the man who <unk> the <unk> was <unk> , with his discovery of the <unk> <unk> in the ' <unk> .
<unk> to my <unk> , you can 't <unk> these <unk> as <unk> because if you you 've done you can 't tell anybody to be <unk> . The <unk> can 't be <unk> because they 're <unk> by a <unk> that 's , of course in the <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
It 's possible to <unk> <unk> only if you <unk> with other <unk> <unk> that <unk> .
Now it 's the beautiful : the <unk> that we find in this <unk> are <unk> of <unk> , the same kind of <unk> to <unk> the <unk> . The question <unk> <unk> : in a <unk> of <unk> species , how do these <unk> <unk> two <unk> not similar , but what if you <unk> in this way , they create a <unk> version that 's <unk> that 's <unk> <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> ?
We use the great <unk> of <unk> and <unk> , which can <unk> .
But if you go to the <unk> , we 'll be <unk> , " <unk> <unk> . "
What does it mean ?
This <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> in the forest , and that <unk> <unk> in the forest , and that our eyes <unk> in the same species .
If you <unk> them as they <unk> their <unk> will help us <unk> , " <unk> <unk> <unk> , " <unk> " <unk> " <unk> . "
The solution is : they take the <unk> <unk> in a night that 's <unk> <unk> in a different <unk> .
And so , you don 't get <unk> , but it 's much more interesting than <unk> <unk> .
Now , the problem is that those of us who have <unk> <unk> them , but in some way to the <unk> <unk> are <unk> them , but in a way to the <unk> of history of our real world , and beyond .
In fact , the <unk> century , in 300 years , not <unk> <unk> for his <unk> or his <unk> <unk> , but rather as the <unk> was where we <unk> and <unk> or <unk> <unk> the mass <unk> of diversity and <unk> and <unk> <unk> of the planet . Now the problem is not the change .
All <unk> through <unk> have been <unk> in a new <unk> <unk> .
And the problem is not the technology .
<unk> <unk> have not <unk> to be <unk> when they put <unk> and <unk> <unk> as they didn 't have <unk> to be <unk> when they <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
It 's not the change or technology that <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> . It 's power .
The <unk> <unk> of <unk> .
And if you look at the world , you 'll see that these are not <unk> <unk> .
They 're <unk> creatures and <unk> <unk> out of existence by <unk> forces that go beyond their <unk> .
<unk> that <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> --
a <unk> <unk> <unk> , in <unk> <unk> , a <unk> that has lived in the forest to a generation <unk> in the forest to a generation <unk> , and now <unk> to the <unk> and the <unk> <unk> , where you can see the <unk> from the <unk> <unk> , which <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> , where you can see the <unk> <unk> <unk> , where the <unk> <unk> <unk> , where the <unk> <unk> <unk> ,
I started to <unk> the <unk> with the <unk> <unk> to the forest .
Or , in the case of <unk> , it 's the disease that are <unk> with the <unk> discovery .
If you <unk> on the <unk> of the <unk> , where I 'm doing a lot of research , you 'll see the <unk> <unk> of politics .
As a <unk> , <unk> physics of a <unk> , is <unk> <unk> , but <unk> , the <unk> of <unk> <unk> 's life of a <unk> , not only is <unk> , but <unk> in certain <unk> , because it 's <unk> in certain <unk> , because it 's part of the development <unk> .
And you can 't understand the <unk> of the <unk> until you start .
I <unk> <unk> miles from <unk> in the Western China through the <unk> <unk> , <unk> to <unk> with a young <unk> , but only <unk> came to <unk> . I realized what the <unk> is behind that I was <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> million people <unk> from the <unk> during the <unk> <unk> .
The father of this guy was <unk> at <unk> <unk> .
which means that it 's been <unk> to the time of Chinese <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> with <unk> <unk> during the <unk> that led to <unk> <unk> .
My mother was <unk> and his <unk> was to be <unk> .
It 's taken of <unk> in <unk> at the age of two <unk> years under his <unk> because he couldn 't have live without him .
<unk> , which has done the same , was <unk> in <unk> .
One day he <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> , and for this <unk> , was <unk> to work <unk> for seven years .
The <unk> of <unk> can be <unk> , but the spirit of the <unk> of the <unk> is from the present .
<unk> , all of that , you get to a choice .
Do you want to live in the <unk> world or we want to <unk> the world of diversity ?
The great <unk> <unk> <unk> , before he died said that his greatest fear was that the one that was that , in our <unk> <unk> view of the world , not only <unk> the whole <unk> of the human imagination to a <unk> <unk> of thought , but a day we had a <unk> <unk> <unk> that there were other possibility .
And it 's <unk> to remember that our species is <unk> for <unk> years .
The <unk> <unk> , that gave us the agriculture , which gave us <unk> to the <unk> <unk> , <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> with the <unk> of the <unk> , creating the <unk> of <unk> , and we talk about <unk> years ago .
The <unk> world has <unk> 300 years .
That <unk> story , I don 't tell you that we have the answers to all the challenges that we <unk> in the <unk> to come .
When these <unk> <unk> of <unk> , what it means to be <unk> , <unk> with <unk> different <unk> .
And it 's in these answers that we all <unk> the possibility of being what we are : a <unk> species , which has to <unk> that all the <unk> and all the <unk> can <unk> . And there are great moments of <unk> .
I <unk> this picture on the north of <unk> , when I went to <unk> <unk> with <unk> , and this man , <unk> , <unk> me the wonderful story of his <unk> .
The <unk> government wasn 't always <unk> with the <unk> <unk> and in the <unk> to <unk> our <unk> , and we <unk> it in <unk> .
The <unk> of this man <unk> <unk> .
<unk> , <unk> for his life , <unk> all the <unk> away , and all of his <unk> .
You want to know that <unk> don 't <unk> , <unk> it .
The <unk> <unk> were made of <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> of this man didn 't <unk> out of the night or the <unk> that <unk> .
It 's <unk> away , it <unk> the <unk> in the <unk> <unk> and <unk> in your hand . When I did it , they <unk> them , they <unk> them , they <unk> them by <unk> them , they <unk> them by <unk> them .
He <unk> <unk> on the <unk> of this <unk> <unk> and when <unk> <unk> , he <unk> a dog .
He <unk> the dog and created a <unk> , with the <unk> <unk> has created a <unk> , has <unk> another dog , and it 's <unk> on the <unk> , <unk> <unk> in <unk> .
What about <unk> ? [ <unk> ] [ <unk> ] and this , in different ways , [ <unk> ] is the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> and all the <unk> <unk> in the world .
<unk> <unk> the <unk> government <unk> the <unk> control of a larger area of <unk> area of California and <unk> together .
It 's their new <unk> . It 's called <unk> .
It 's a <unk> <unk> . It 's all the <unk> resources .
One <unk> example of how a <unk> can <unk> with his <unk> .
And , finally , I think it 's pretty <unk> at least who we have been in these <unk> <unk> areas on the planet , and they realize that they 're not not going to be at all .
For someone is home .
<unk> <unk> of the human imagination that <unk> to the <unk> of the time . And for us all , the dreams of these children , like the dreams of our children , become part of the <unk> hope of the <unk> .
<unk> , we <unk> <unk> , we <unk> , <unk> , that <unk> never <unk> to anything .
I 'm going to say <unk> --
<unk> <unk> don 't be <unk> , but we believe that stories can change the world , and maybe we are the best <unk> to tell the stories of the world . Every month our website <unk> <unk> million <unk> .
<unk> <unk> : <unk> our <unk> <unk> .
Our <unk> are <unk> by millions of people .
Our work is <unk> in <unk> to bring our public to <unk> our public <unk> places that <unk> away from which <unk> <unk> <unk> from how much they saw and , <unk> , <unk> , the <unk> world of <unk> , and we need to find a <unk> of life in the diversity , and we need to find a <unk> in a <unk> world and <unk> <unk> .
where we <unk> all the <unk> <unk> to our <unk> <unk> .
Thank you .
I 'm going to talk about some things that I 've written in this book that I hope you 've already heard and <unk> a few <unk> <unk> , in case you don 't .
I want to start with what I call the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> what ?
The <unk> <unk> of all <unk> societies . The <unk> <unk> <unk> : " If we want to <unk> the <unk> of our citizens . " The way to do it is to <unk> freedom . "
The reason is , on one side , in fact that freedom is in itself value , is <unk> , <unk> , <unk> for human beings .
On the other one is that if we 're <unk> , every one of us can act <unk> to realize that we 're <unk> our <unk> , without anybody who <unk> in our name .
The way to <unk> the freedom is to <unk> choice .
The more choices people , more <unk> are <unk> , and more <unk> is their freedom , more their <unk> , is their <unk> .
This , <unk> , is so <unk> <unk> in society that no no one <unk> in <unk> .
And it 's also <unk> <unk> in our lives .
I 'm going to show you some examples of what progress has made possible .
This is my <unk> . It 's not particularly big .
I <unk> a simple note on the <unk> to <unk> .
In my <unk> , there are <unk> <unk> , without <unk> the 10 <unk> of <unk> <unk> and the 12 <unk> <unk> that you can buy for a huge number of <unk> in the <unk> that no one of the <unk> <unk> is in your <unk> .
Here 's what <unk> is what <unk> is .
Then you go to the <unk> store for <unk> : <unk> , <unk> , radio <unk> , radio <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
And in this single <unk> store , there 's a large number of <unk> <unk> .
We can make six and a half million different <unk> using the <unk> that there are in one store .
<unk> <unk> that there is <unk> choice .
<unk> <unk> : the world of <unk> .
Once , when I was a child , you could get all the services <unk> , in <unk> that they were <unk> by <unk> <unk> .
You get the phone , you know , you 're going to .
A <unk> of that , by the way , was that the phone never <unk> .
These days , they went to .
We have a <unk> <unk> of <unk> , especially between cell phones .
Here 's cell phones .
My <unk> is in the middle , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , and <unk> for the <unk> <unk> .
If you haven 't seen it yet in the store under the house , you 're very well sure you can soon see .
And what 's the end of what happens is that people <unk> in the <unk> and ask this question . And you know what 's the answer is " No . "
You can 't buy a cell phone that doesn 't face <unk> things .
So , in other <unk> of life that are much more important than <unk> , you get the same <unk> of choices .
<unk> <unk> : <unk> <unk> what you have to the United States you 're going to the <unk> and the <unk> you that you have to do .
Instead , you get out of the <unk> , and the <unk> says , " OK , we could do A , or <unk> , " he 's got these <unk> and these <unk> . What do you want to do ? "
You were <unk> , " <unk> , what do you want to do ? "
And the <unk> says , " He 's got these <unk> and these <unk> , and <unk> has these <unk> and <unk> . "
" What do you want to do ? "
And you say , " <unk> if you were me , what would you like me ? "
And the <unk> : " But I 'm not her . "
We call the " <unk> of <unk> , <unk> that makes it look like a beautiful thing .
But actually it 's not that one <unk> the weight and responsibility to make decisions that knows something , <unk> the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> that <unk> , <unk> , <unk> that <unk> , <unk> , and therefore , of course , is <unk> <unk> -- and therefore , of course , is <unk> <unk> -- and therefore , of course , is <unk> <unk> -- and therefore , it 's not in the <unk> <unk> to make
There 's a huge <unk> of <unk> products , <unk> to people like me and you , that if you think of it has no sense , because we can 't <unk> .
But if we can 't <unk> , why do we <unk> them ?
The answer is they want to <unk> , we call the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> that 's as a fundamental way that 's our <unk> . It 's a question of as you see in this <unk> . " We don 't want to <unk> kids . <unk> their sex at the right time . " We don 't know a <unk> . We have to <unk> it .
And we can <unk> how many times we <unk> .
which means that every <unk> , <unk> , you have to decide that kind of person you want to be .
And it 's <unk> to the family and <unk> , a <unk> perspective , almost anybody , that was that you could see as soon as possible , and you could get kids as soon as possible .
The only real choice was with who , not when , and you know what to do later .
<unk> , everything is really to play .
They 're very smart students at very smart students , and they <unk> them 20 percent less work than a time .
And not because they 're less <unk> , not because they 're less <unk> .
but why am I <unk> , I 'm going to <unk> , " <unk> <unk> or not ? "
" <unk> <unk> <unk> ? I have to think about the children or the career ? "
They 're <unk> <unk> .
And they try to answer these questions , even if this <unk> doesn 't <unk> the <unk> that you don 't get the <unk> that you can 't get a beautiful <unk> to my <unk> .
And they have to do that . They 're important questions .
Now , the work : we 're <unk> , as <unk> <unk> , because technology <unk> us to work every day , from every day , from every corner of the planet , <unk> that from the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , there is a <unk> , and I won 't say anybody , which is where the <unk> works .
I don 't tell you , because I want to use it .
What it means , this incredible freedom of choice that we have about the work ? It 's that we need to decide , <unk> at any time , if we have to work or not .
We can go to see our son to play <unk> , with the cell phone in a <unk> , the <unk> in the other , and the <unk> , <unk> .
And even though I 'm <unk> , every minute we see the <unk> , we 're also <unk> , " I have to answer this call ? "
" I have to answer this <unk> ? I have to take this letter ? "
And even when the answer is , " no , that makes the experience of your <unk> son a very different different than what it would be in other conditions .
So , from any <unk> , you know , small things and big objects , and <unk> , life is a question of choices .
Once the world was this : <unk> , there were some possibility , but it was not a question of choice .
The world of today is this : The <unk> is , " Is it a <unk> thing , or <unk> ? "
The answer is <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , we all know , so I 'm going to talk about the <unk> .
<unk> this choice <unk> two effects effects of people .
The first one , <unk> , is that it <unk> instead of <unk> .
With a lot of <unk> between which choice , it becomes very difficult to do it .
I 'll give you an example : a study <unk> on <unk> <unk> <unk> .
A <unk> of my <unk> has access to <unk> data , <unk> society with about a million <unk> <unk> in different companies .
What she found out is that for every 10 <unk> that are <unk> , the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> two percent .
With 50 <unk> <unk> , there 's 10 percent less than <unk> when they 're only five <unk> . Why ?
Because with 50 <unk> of which choice , is to make it hard to decide , and the choice is <unk> to the <unk> .
And in <unk> , and again <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and of course <unk> , and of course <unk> never gets .
<unk> that doesn 't mean that only means that these <unk> <unk> food to <unk> because they don 't have enough money , he wants to say that the decision is so <unk> that they also <unk> <unk> <unk> of work .
They 're not <unk> , they 're <unk> up to five <unk> per year from the <unk> of work , which would be <unk> to <unk> .
So <unk> is a <unk> of having <unk> choices .
And I think that 's going to change the world like this .
" And finally , to <unk> , <unk> , <unk> or <unk> ? "
I really want to make the right decision , if it 's for the <unk> , right ?
You don 't want to choose the wrong wrong , and you 're going to get the <unk> wrong .
So this is the first effect . The second is that even if we can <unk> <unk> and make a choice , finally we 're <unk> from the result of how to <unk> states with less <unk> between which which choice .
And that 's a number of reasons .
One of them is that with a lot of <unk> between which choice , if you <unk> one and it 's not perfect , it 's easy to imagine that they could make a different choice that would be better . And what happens is that the <unk> <unk> us to <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> <unk> from <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> by <unk> , and the <unk> decision ,
even when it was a <unk> decision .
More choices are , the more <unk> is easy to <unk> than any <unk> that is <unk> of <unk> choice .
<unk> , there is what <unk> call .
Dan <unk> <unk> very well <unk> like the value that we give things things that we <unk> .
<unk> rest , when there 's a lot of <unk> possible , it 's easy to <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> of the <unk> that 's choice .
Here 's an example . I 'm <unk> with all the ones that are not in New York .
But that 's what probably <unk> .
There 's this <unk> to <unk> .
A <unk> place .
<unk> <unk> . <unk> day . It 's all about it .
<unk> nothing . But what he thinks is , " Well , <unk> , it 's <unk> . "
" All my <unk> <unk> are away . "
" You 're going to <unk> right in front of home . "
And it <unk> two weeks from the idea that 's going to take -- every day , the possibility of <unk> where it wants .
<unk> <unk> the <unk> for what we have , even when the choice was <unk> .
And the more of the <unk> we have from <unk> , the more <unk> <unk> , you 're <unk> against the way <unk> .
Here 's another example .
This <unk> tells us a lot of things .
It 's about to live the moment , and maybe of living in slowly .
But the most important point is that anything you 're going to <unk> , you will not do other .
The things that don 't <unk> have a lot of <unk> that can make less <unk> what we do .
<unk> point : <unk> <unk> <unk> .
I tried it to my skin <unk> a new couple of <unk> .
It almost always <unk> .
Once the <unk> were one of the <unk> , they <unk> them and <unk> by <unk> , they were <unk> , only after they had a life and <unk> a lot of times <unk> to go well .
So , I started to <unk> a couple of new when the <unk> were gone , and I said , " I need a couple of <unk> , this is my <unk> . "
The <unk> said , " Do you want them to <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> ? "
You want them to <unk> or <unk> ? " <unk> " or " <unk> " ? "
" Do you want them to <unk> ? "
" <unk> <unk> <unk> or <unk> ? <unk> <unk> -- " <unk> <unk> . "
I was <unk> , and after a while I was able to say , " I want the guy -- which was the only guy , " he was the only guy , so for an hour hour I <unk> all <unk> <unk> <unk> , and then <unk> from the store , <unk> , <unk> , and then <unk> from the store , <unk> , <unk> , and then I was the <unk> <unk> <unk> , and I was the <unk> <unk> I had ever had .
It was the <unk> . With all that choice I had <unk> the best .
But I 'm going to get worse .
Why ? I 've written a whole book to <unk> .
The reason I was worse is that with all that choice my <unk> were <unk> , the <unk> <unk> to be <unk> .
I had <unk> <unk> . I didn 't know anything about <unk> when I was <unk> up with it just one like this . But when I was 100 different , you would say , at least one had to be perfect .
What I had <unk> was good , but not perfect .
After I <unk> that <unk> with what I was <unk> in <unk> to <unk> .
The <unk> of <unk> in the lives of people don 't make <unk> the <unk> that these <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> themselves .
And this <unk> <unk> , even when the results are good .
<unk> in the world of <unk> if they realize it .
Because if you <unk> it , I don 't know what I 'm talking about .
The truth is more to that .
" It was worse when it was worse , " Why was it better when it was worse is that when it was worse is that when it was worse , it was <unk> <unk> .
<unk> , in the world that we live in -- <unk> , <unk> citizens with the <unk> of <unk> -- the <unk> that we can <unk> is that things are <unk> to the <unk> .
You 've never never never <unk> <unk> because your <unk> , my <unk> , are <unk> .
The <unk> of happiness -- what you 're here -- is , " <unk> <unk> " Yes , you want to . "
I mean , little <unk> moment -- which I 'm really <unk> and my wife is really <unk> .
I couldn 't do that , I couldn 't do it .
But <unk> doesn 't always <unk> .
<unk> , a <unk> of a <unk> of <unk> <unk> when there is only that kind of <unk> is that when you 're not <unk> , and you say , " Why ? "
" Who is <unk> ? " " I 'm <unk> .
The world is <unk> . What can I do it ?
When you have hundreds of types of <unk> , and you get one <unk> , and you get a <unk> , and you 'll tell who is the <unk> , it 's clear that you 're .
I could have better better .
With hundreds of <unk> available , there are no <unk> for <unk> .
So when people make decisions , even if the <unk> is <unk> , they <unk> <unk> and give them their <unk> .
In the last few years , the <unk> is <unk> in the <unk> world .
I think a <unk> <unk> -- not the only , but important -- this <unk> <unk> is really that people have <unk> experiences because the standard of <unk> is really that people have <unk> experiences because the standard <unk> are too <unk> .
And when they 're thinking about that they think <unk> is them .
So the final result is that we 're better , <unk> , but we 're worse .
Let me show you .
This is the <unk> <unk> , what we all take for good and is completely <unk> . It 's not true .
There 's no <unk> that a little bit of choice is better than <unk> at all , but this doesn 't make it much choice is better than a little bit .
There 's a <unk> value , <unk> . I don 't know what it is .
But I 'm quite sure we 've <unk> from a piece of the level that the choices <unk> our life .
Now , from a <unk> perspective -- I 've been almost up -- from a <unk> point of view , <unk> is the <unk> .
What <unk> all this choice in the <unk> society is the <unk> material .
There are many places in the world , and you know , <unk> <unk> , where the problem is not that they have <unk> choice .
The problem is they have too <unk> .
So the <unk> I 'm talking about is a <unk> <unk> , <unk> society .
And what <unk> does and <unk> is this : <unk> <unk> talked about yesterday about how the <unk> and <unk> <unk> to <unk> are <unk> . It 's a <unk> of money .
I mean , these choices , <unk> and <unk> , it 's not that they just <unk> .
They 're <unk> <unk> .
They make us worse .
If a little bit of what we do in our society <unk> to be <unk> choice was <unk> in those where people have too few <unk> , it would not be only their life to <unk> , but our .
This is what <unk> call a <unk> <unk> .
A <unk> of income does well for everybody -- not just the poor -- because of this choice in <unk> that we 're <unk> .
To end up , " You can get everything you want to --
<unk> , people of culture , I said , " But what that fish do that fish ? "
" It 's <unk> that you can 't get to <unk> in a glass <unk> . "
" A <unk> imagination , a <unk> view of the world -- "
and <unk> I <unk> it so , at the beginning .
But then , <unk> , I realized that that that fish knows that that fish knows it .
Because the reality of the <unk> is that if you <unk> the <unk> , so that " everything is possible , " you can 't <unk> the freedom . You <unk> the <unk> .
If you <unk> the <unk> so that everything could <unk> it possible to <unk> the <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> .
Everybody needs a <unk> .
This is almost certainly too <unk> , maybe even for the fish , and certainly certainly for the fish .
But the <unk> of some <unk> <unk> is a <unk> for <unk> and , for <unk> .
Thank you very much .
