<unk> year I showed these <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> , which for almost three million years has had the size of the United States <unk> , has <unk> <unk> 40 percent .
We 're going to <unk> the <unk> of the problem because it 's not showing the ice <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> is , in a way , the heart <unk> of global climate system .
They <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
The next <unk> is going to be a <unk> <unk> on the last 25 years .
<unk> <unk> are <unk> in red .
You can see , it <unk> up to the blue <unk> .
That 's the ice in <unk> , which is <unk> summer .
You can see that the <unk> ice <unk> , of five years or more , it 's like blood , that 's <unk> here from the body .
It 's been <unk> over the years , like this .
This is a problem because the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> around the ocean , where there are huge <unk> of <unk> that , <unk> , <unk> , are <unk> <unk> into <unk> .
<unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , that <unk> <unk> <unk> may be <unk> , <unk> this point of not <unk> .
In some of the <unk> <unk> is already <unk> by the water .
The <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> last <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> ! <unk> : You 're doing it . The question is if we 'll <unk> it .
A reason is that this <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> from the north .
This is a river in <unk> <unk> .
<unk> had never <unk> <unk> .
This is the <unk> river in the <unk> of <unk> .
If you want to know how the sea <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> on <unk> , here is where the sea .
These <unk> are <unk> .
On the other side of the planet : <unk> , the largest <unk> of the ice on the planet .
And last month , scientists have <unk> that the ice <unk> in <unk> , and that <unk> <unk> , and the Western <unk> , that <unk> on some <unk> <unk> , is particularly <unk> in <unk> .
<unk> at six feet of the <unk> , like in <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , the largest <unk> of ice , you can see new <unk> , which a few years ago were <unk> .
40 percent of the world population <unk> by that <unk> .
<unk> <unk> : This <unk> is the source of <unk> water .
<unk> is <unk> .
But when you look at the same time , the same thing happens to the <unk> water .
<unk> <unk> is 40 percent <unk> .
<unk> <unk> are in crisis .
<unk> , as you read , they are <unk> .
<unk> <unk> in the world leads to a <unk> increase in the world .
<unk> <unk> are <unk> to a <unk> outside the normal and without <unk> .
<unk> times more <unk> in the last 30 years of <unk> .
This is a <unk> of all <unk> .
If you look at it in the <unk> context , you can see the <unk> .
In the last five years , we 've been <unk> 70 million <unk> of CO2 every 24 hours -- 25 million <unk> in the oceans .
Look at <unk> the area , from the <unk> , to <unk> , and on both of the <unk> <unk> , and on both of the <unk> <unk> , where there is a <unk> <unk> of oxygen in the ocean .
The biggest cause of global warming , together to <unk> , which is 20 percent , is the use of <unk> <unk> .
<unk> is a problem , and <unk> is even worse .
The United States is one of the two countries with <unk> emissions , together to China .
And it 's <unk> to build a lot of other <unk> .
But we 're <unk> to a <unk> of the direction .
These are the <unk> projects over the last few years and some of <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> , there is a political <unk> in our country .
<unk> <unk> and <unk> have <unk> million dollars in the last year to <unk> <unk> , which is a <unk> .
I 'm going to give me something --
<unk> <unk> , in <unk> , where I live , there was a <unk> of <unk> billion <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
You might see it on the <unk> .
This is the second largest <unk> in America .
It 's happened around <unk> .
<unk> <unk> of one of <unk> <unk> was this .
<unk> : <unk> , <unk> is a <unk> and happy guy .
It 's <unk> here in America , and it <unk> our economy .
<unk> <unk> is <unk> .
It 's <unk> , <unk> and <unk> <unk> it .
<unk> : From here is a lot of <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The largest society <unk> on the <unk> is <unk> <unk> . This is his <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> . <unk> <unk> : <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> -- don 't know what they 're talking about .
<unk> : So the <unk> for the <unk> of <unk> has <unk> two <unk> .
This is one of them , one part .
<unk> : <unk> : <unk> we see <unk> changes as a <unk> <unk> in our business .
So , we have a big amount of money in a <unk> <unk> to <unk> and public <unk> the truth on <unk> .
In fact , <unk> is not <unk> .
We think it 's <unk> -- it 's also good <unk> .
So we don 't think about climate change .
We want to do it .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> -- you 've heard about it a lot of talk about it .
So , I 'm going to <unk> a <unk> in a <unk> , as much of <unk> .
<unk> ! The machines are a little bit <unk> , but this is the sound of <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> is between the major <unk> of global warming , but the <unk> technology that you see all .
Let 's look : this is the <unk> technology 's <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to the economic issue and the national security .
<unk> : <unk> is in crisis ; America is in the <unk> ; the national security crisis .
The <unk> that <unk> all : our <unk> from the <unk> <unk> , like <unk> and oil <unk> .
Now , though , there 's a new , <unk> solution to <unk> .
<unk> America : 100 percent of <unk> energy , in 10 years .
A plan to <unk> America at work , <unk> more <unk> , and help <unk> global warming .
<unk> , a solution that we can solve our problems .
<unk> America . <unk> more .
<unk> : This is the last one .
<unk> : It 's about energy energy to America .
One of the most <unk> ways to <unk> from <unk> that <unk> our planet .
<unk> : The future is here . <unk> , sun , <unk> , a new <unk> network .
<unk> <unk> 2 : <unk> <unk> for jobs
<unk> : <unk> America . It 's time to be <unk> .
Al <unk> : A old <unk> <unk> says , " If you want to go <unk> , go alone .
If you want to go far , go together . "
We have to go far , quickly .
Thank you very much .
<unk> year at TED I did a <unk> on <unk> .
And I decided to <unk> on how the car works .
So here we go . And for those who were not , the other time , they were not <unk> -- <unk> miles of <unk> .
<unk> is to <unk> the conditions that were in <unk> than a <unk> of the <unk> from the beginning of the universe -- until <unk> million times a second .
All of that is just <unk> .
This is the machine under <unk> .
We <unk> these <unk> <unk> inside the <unk> .
This is what I work . It 's called <unk> -- <unk> feet , and it has a <unk> <unk> .
This is a <unk> image of <unk> in construction so you can see the <unk> .
<unk> <unk> last year we <unk> the car <unk> .
And this picture was taken by <unk> .
It was <unk> <unk> in control room .
It 's a picture of the <unk> of particles that had made all the <unk> , <unk> in <unk> , with <unk> , with a part of the <unk> , and <unk> particles inside the <unk> .
In other words , when you look at that image 10 <unk> , you 'll notice that the car <unk> , which is a great <unk> .
I don 't know if it was this to <unk> us more or that , when someone <unk> on Google and <unk> that page was this .
That means we had a <unk> impact beyond that scientific .
<unk> a week later , there was a problem with the machine , <unk> to these <unk> here -- these <unk> <unk> .
These <unk> <unk> <unk> when the car works at the <unk> of the <unk> .
Now , the <unk> between you <unk> and <unk> , " It 's not true . I 'm too <unk> . "
And instead they can do it because when they 're very <unk> to <unk> <unk> .
So , at least <unk> degrees , at a temperature <unk> to the <unk> of space between stars , these <unk> can bring that <unk> .
In one of the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> in the <unk> , there was a <unk> of <unk> .
So the <unk> <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a electric <unk> .
This was the result .
Now , this is even more <unk> if you think that these <unk> <unk> more than 20 <unk> , and that 's about 30 <unk> .
They <unk> about 50 <unk> .
<unk> , what we did .
We <unk> them and <unk> .
They 're all <unk> to their <unk> .
<unk> the <unk> is going to be new <unk> .
We <unk> it , and we try to get data to <unk> or <unk> , and so on our <unk> to find out what the <unk> are the universe .
Now , of course , in a way , these <unk> <unk> the value of science and engineering engineering of <unk> . And it 's easy to <unk> .
I think that 's so hard , the fact that it 's going to beyond <unk> , I think that 's the value of things like <unk> .
I want to end with the words of a <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , who , <unk> , <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> , his <unk> was Michael <unk> , said , " It 's not as <unk> as the <unk> that the ideas of human mind as the <unk> that the ideas of science are <unk> , that there are not <unk> in nature , that there are no new <unk> of nature , that there are not new <unk> by <unk> . "
Thank you .
I want to start with <unk> to <unk> to when , as children , <unk> with <unk> .
And as we were <unk> and <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , we actually start thinking and solve problems and solve <unk> problems .
The <unk> <unk> is <unk> <unk> to the way that most of the world around us .
So , as a <unk> <unk> from the <unk> of our <unk> with <unk> objects , together to my <unk> <unk> , and my <unk> <unk> <unk> , I started <unk> : " And if , when we use a computer , instead of having the only <unk> of the <unk> as a <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to information with both hands ,
and <unk> to our <unk> ?
The question was so interesting that I decided to <unk> the answer , building the answer , building <unk> .
In a few words , a <unk> is a <unk> computer as a <unk> .
In a few words , a <unk> is a <unk> computer as a <unk> .
You can <unk> them with your hand , they can <unk> with each other , they can hear their movement and they have a screen and a <unk> radio .
But <unk> , they 're <unk> objects , like <unk> , you can just <unk> <unk> .
<unk> are the <unk> of a new <unk> of tools to <unk> digital information .
And as they become more <unk> , <unk> of their movement , <unk> of the other , and as they become more <unk> , <unk> of their movement , of other , how they can <unk> them , and <unk> <unk> of <unk> .
Let 's start with some simple example .
This <unk> is <unk> to show <unk> : if you <unk> it in a direction , the video will be able to do this , if you go to the other side back .
These <unk> <unk> are <unk> of others .
If you <unk> them , you look at what they are around .
If they 're <unk> , they <unk> and they can <unk> a little bit .
If they 're <unk> , they <unk> and they can <unk> a little bit .
They 're also going to <unk> their movement and <unk> .
We 've <unk> that one of the interesting <unk> of the <unk> was to be able to use <unk> on the data , for example , <unk> <unk> , like <unk> .
In this case , we have three <unk> <unk> as a <unk> of <unk> , and I can <unk> it to <unk> color , where they <unk> .
and I can <unk> it to <unk> color in that central where you 're <unk> .
If you get too much , we can <unk> a little bit of a place .
There are also <unk> possibilities , like <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and games where people can try things things , and they <unk> the results immediately .
I 'm --
This is a <unk> sequence I do with a <unk> program .
Here we have a <unk> of words that are in half between <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> , at every <unk> , <unk> a letter on every <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , every <unk> , <unk> a letter on every <unk> , and while I was <unk> <unk> , he <unk> on a <unk> .
Then , after about 30 seconds , you <unk> , and you have a new <unk> to try and <unk> .
Thank you .
Here are <unk> children in <unk> at the <unk> <unk> , I did so that I <unk> them and I <unk> a video .
They are very <unk> .
And one of the interesting things of <unk> is that you don 't have to give people a lot of <unk> .
I just said , " <unk> of the words , " and they know exactly what to do .
Here are other people who <unk> it .
This is our <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , there .
It actually wanted to <unk> .
They were just <unk> , for him .
Now , this is a <unk> <unk> .
We had to build a tool for the <unk> of the <unk> . He 's <unk> .
It can <unk> new characters in the scene , <unk> their <unk> .
It can <unk> new characters in the scene , <unk> their <unk> .
So , this is doing the sun is coming up .
<unk> : The sun is <unk> .
David <unk> : Now he 's brought a <unk> in the scene .
<unk> : The <unk> <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> . <unk> !
So , we <unk> the <unk> and <unk> can <unk> the characters --
<unk> : <unk> !
and tell you about your story .
<unk> : <unk> !
<unk> : It 's a story with the open , and it can decide how they <unk> .
<unk> : It 's a story with the open , and it can decide how they <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> away , <unk> .
<unk> : The last example I have time I 'm going to show you is a <unk> , <unk> <unk> and <unk> music .
It 's a <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> music .
<unk> here are <unk> as a <unk> , <unk> and <unk> it .
<unk> of these have four different <unk> , and you can choose which to use .
You can also <unk> these <unk> in a sequence of your <unk> .
And they just <unk> by doing a <unk> sound and a sequence and a sequence .
These are the effects of alive , like <unk> and <unk> .
I 'll <unk> it up to a particular sound and then <unk> to <unk> .
And then there are the effects of time and <unk> , that <unk> to the entire sequence .
It 's <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> a <unk> in two <unk> , " sequence , " <unk> , " <unk> in a series , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk>
Now , you 're going to take a <unk> line .
<unk> : Now you 're going to <unk> --
<unk> : And now I 'm going to <unk> the <unk> to the <unk> , so I can control the effect of the alive .
<unk> : I can <unk> the entire sequence time on one side or the other .
<unk> : And now we <unk> the <unk> to give more <unk> .
<unk> : I can <unk> the sequence of <unk> to flight .
So I don 't have to <unk> before , but I can <unk> it , it 's going to go , I 'll go back again , <unk> or more <unk> .
And now , finally , I can <unk> the entire <unk> sequence on the left <unk> <unk> .
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is to build new <unk> <unk> , <unk> more and more <unk> to how our brain work and body .
And today , I 've had time to show you one of the results of this path , and some <unk> that we 're going to get out of the lab .
The concept that I want to <unk> is that 's going to <unk> this new generation of objects to <unk> to <unk> with the <unk> media , that we want to <unk> information in our world in the way that we want .
Thank you very much .
I don 't see the time of talking to all of you .
I 'm a <unk> .
<unk> books is my <unk> , but it 's more than that , of course .
It 's also love and love <unk> of my life .
And I don 't expect that to change .
But , said this , something that has happened in my life and my career , and it led me to <unk> the whole relationship with this job .
The particular thing is I <unk> wrote this book , this <unk> called " <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
And the result is that everywhere I 'm <unk> , people <unk> me as if I was <unk> .
<unk> -- <unk> , <unk> !
<unk> to me now everybody <unk> and they say , " Do you don 't fear it any more ?
You don 't fear to keep writing for all life that can be able to create a book that can <unk> to someone ? "
<unk> you can <unk> to someone ? "
It 's <unk> , you know .
But it could go worse , except that I remember more than 20 years ago , when I was saying to people -- I was a <unk> -- I wanted to be a <unk> .
I 'm going to go to the same <unk> <unk> by fear .
And people say , " Don 't you know you don 't know to be able to successful ?
You don 't fear that the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> ?
You don 't fear to do this <unk> for all of life without <unk> that nothing is ever outside and dying on a <unk> of <unk> with the mouth full of <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> ?
So , you know , you know .
The answer -- the short answer to all these questions is , " Yeah . "
Yeah , I 'm afraid of all those things .
I 've always had fear .
And I 'm afraid of many other things that people don 't have to be .
Like <unk> and other things that are <unk> .
But , as it is to write what I thought and <unk> me is why ?
Is that <unk> ?
It 's <unk> that anybody who <unk> <unk> to be <unk> by a job that you feel like <unk> to do .
But what is so particular in the <unk> <unk> <unk> to <unk> health care about <unk> <unk> in a way that other <unk> don 't do ?
Like my father , for example , he was a <unk> and not <unk> of once in his 40 years of activity where he was asked if fear to be <unk> to be <unk> ?
It never -- that <unk> of the <unk> John , how do you ?
<unk> 't you that way , <unk> ?
<unk> , engineers <unk> as a group of <unk> as a group , <unk> the <unk> of being <unk> <unk> .
We <unk> , we have enough this <unk> , and not only <unk> but <unk> all kinds of <unk> , we have this <unk> to be <unk> <unk> .
And he <unk> , he <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> that , only in the <unk> century , <unk> young and often for them .
And those who don 't <unk> seem to be <unk> by their <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , before they die in the last <unk> , he said , " Every <unk> book <unk> me a little more <unk> about the work of his life .
But we don 't know that we 've got to do that , because we heard these things so long long that somehow we have completely <unk> and <unk> the <unk> that creativity and <unk> are in some way that <unk> and <unk> , at the end , always <unk> .
And the question I want to <unk> to all of us to all here is : are you agree with this idea ?
You know , you know , <unk> <unk> from a <unk> distance to me , it 's not good for all this <unk> .
I think it 's <unk> .
And I think it 's <unk> , and I don 't want to <unk> in the next century .
I think it 's better to <unk> our great <unk> to live .
And I certainly know that , in my case -- in my situation -- it would be very <unk> to start <unk> to that <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> in which I 'm in my career .
<unk> -- look at , I 'm pretty young , I 'm pretty young .
I have about four <unk> of work in me .
And it 's very <unk> that anything that has been <unk> by the world like the work that after <unk> <unk> success of my last book .
<unk> <unk> , because we 're all about <unk> friends here -- is <unk> that my greatest success is to my <unk> .
Oh , <unk> , <unk> , thinking !
You know this is the kind of thought that leads a person to start <unk> to <unk> <unk> to the nine of the morning and I don 't want to .
I want to continue doing this work that I love .
So , the question becomes , how ?
And so it seems to me , after many <unk> , that the way to work on <unk> is to create a <unk> <unk> , OK ?
I have to have to come a <unk> distance between me , that I 'm <unk> , and my natural <unk> on what the <unk> <unk> <unk> . And as I was going to get to look through the time , how to look through time , trying to find other society to see if you have better ideas and see if you could have better ideas and see if you have better ideas and more <unk>
about how to <unk> people who are <unk> <unk> <unk> of creativity .
And that research has taken me to the <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
<unk> because I was going to go back and then we go back .
<unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> -- people don 't believe that creativity <unk> from men , OK ?
It turns out that creativity was this <unk> spirit and <unk> to men and <unk> to <unk> to men and <unk> to <unk> , for reasons and <unk> .
<unk> <unk> these <unk> <unk> of creativity <unk> .
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> to have a <unk> that <unk> <unk> from <unk> .
The <unk> were the same idea , but they <unk> that kind of spirit without a <unk> .
And that 's <unk> , because <unk> <unk> didn 't really think that a <unk> was a particularly smart .
I thought a <unk> was this kind of <unk> <unk> <unk> , literally in the <unk> of the study of an artist , a little artist , <unk> like <unk> <unk> , and that <unk> out to <unk> the work of the artist 's 's work of the artist 's work of the artist and <unk> the result of that work .
<unk> <unk> , here is the distance I 'm talking -- that <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> you from your <unk> .
And everybody thought that was so that you <unk> , right ?
So , the <unk> artists were <unk> to <unk> things , like too much , like too much , right ?
If your work was <unk> , you didn 't have to <unk> the <unk> , everybody <unk> that was <unk> by this <unk> <unk> .
If your work work , it wasn 't all your <unk> , right ?
Everybody <unk> it was your <unk> to be a <unk> .
And so people are <unk> <unk> creativity , for a long time .
Then the <unk> <unk> and all <unk> , and we <unk> this great idea ; we put the human being on the center of the universe and the <unk> and the <unk> and <unk> and no longer <unk> space to <unk> from <unk> .
This was the <unk> principle and people began to think that creativity has been <unk> completely from <unk> .
And for the first time in history , it <unk> to <unk> this or the artist as a <unk> rather than a person with <unk> .
And I have to <unk> , I think it was a big <unk> .
I think of somebody , a simple person to believe that they 're like a <unk> , like the source , the <unk> and <unk> of all the <unk> <unk> , <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> is a <unk> that big <unk> to human <unk> .
It 's like to ask someone to <unk> the sun .
<unk> and <unk> completely <unk> the <unk> and creates all these <unk> <unk> on the <unk> .
And I think it was this pressure that <unk> artists in the <unk> 500 years .
And if that 's true , and I think that 's the question , the question becomes , and now ?
Can we do that ?
We want to go back to a more <unk> understanding of the relationship between humans and <unk> <unk> .
Or maybe not .
Maybe we can 't spend 500 years of thinking in an <unk> talk about 18 minutes .
And there 's probably people in the audience who <unk> <unk> <unk> on their <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , do they <unk> <unk> people to <unk> on their projects .
You probably don 't <unk> all about that .
But the question I want to <unk> is -- why not ?
Why don 't you that way ?
Because it has more than anything else I 've ever heard about the <unk> <unk> of <unk> process .
A process that , as anyone who has ever <unk> to do something -- so , so , everybody -- you know , you don 't <unk> <unk> .
And in fact , it can sometimes be completely <unk> .
I 've done this <unk> with the extraordinary <unk> <unk> , who has now 90 years , but it was a <unk> for the whole life and told me that during his <unk> <unk> , <unk> out in the <unk> <unk> , <unk> out in the <unk> <unk> , and <unk> it , inside in the <unk> <unk> .
And she said it was like a <unk> <unk> .
And that <unk> <unk> to her <unk> .
You could get it , because he was <unk> the land under his feet .
I decided to have just one thing to do , and that was , words , " <unk> like a <unk> . "
And so he <unk> up to the house and was <unk> by this <unk> , and it wouldn 't have to do anything else that take a piece of paper and a <unk> enough <unk> and <unk> on the page .
<unk> times , we couldn 't get enough enough , so I <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> without able to get to home and the <unk> through and she would <unk> it through and she would <unk> it through the <unk> , looking for , as she said , " another <unk> . "
And then there were those times -- this piece never <unk> it -- there was never -- there were times when the <unk> was almost <unk> , right ?
So , he was <unk> at home and he was looking for the paper and the <unk> through , and he <unk> a <unk> just in the while he was <unk> , and then he was like she <unk> with the other hand and <unk> it .
<unk> the <unk> from the tail and <unk> it into his body and the <unk> on the page .
And in these cases , the <unk> would be <unk> on the <unk> page and <unk> but <unk> , the <unk> <unk> to the first word .
So when I <unk> it -- it 's <unk> , it 's <unk> to my <unk> process .
Not a <unk> process -- I 'm not a <unk> !
I 'm a <unk> , and my way of <unk> is ; I 'm going to <unk> every day and work and work and <unk> on top .
But even me in my <unk> , I <unk> against that thing , sometimes .
And I would say that many of you would do that .
You know , even if the work and ideas , I <unk> to <unk> from a certain source , I don 't have to <unk> .
And what is this thing ?
And how can we <unk> it in it , we don 't lose our head , but , rather than it 's <unk> us ?
As I 'm <unk> , the best example I have is the <unk> <unk> <unk> , which I <unk> different years ago for a <unk> .
And I was talking about this , and you know , <unk> , for the <unk> of life was the <unk> artist 's <unk> <unk> , trying to control , <unk> these <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
But then <unk> , he was <unk> , and one day as he was <unk> on a <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> it all over for him .
<unk> fast and everything is a <unk> <unk> this little <unk> of <unk> , coming into his head as the <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , and the <unk> , and the <unk> , and the <unk> , but he doesn 't know how to <unk> .
It has no piece of paper , it has no <unk> , it has no <unk> .
So he starts to feel this <unk> species of <unk> as a <unk> , " I 'm going to lose , and <unk> <unk> from this <unk> song .
I 'm not <unk> enough , and I can 't <unk> . "
And instead of going to <unk> , they <unk> .
We had the entire process and did something completely new .
I just <unk> the sky and said , " <unk> , don 't you see that I 'm <unk> ? "
" It seems to <unk> that <unk> a song now ?
If you really want to <unk> , you 're going to get a more <unk> when I can take care of you .
<unk> , <unk> to <unk> more <unk> today .
<unk> <unk> <unk> . "
And his <unk> process after that .
Not the work , the work was still <unk> as always .
But the process , and the <unk> <unk> that <unk> was <unk> when the <unk> , the <unk> that <unk> was out of him , the <unk> that <unk> out of him , and he <unk> back from where , he thought it was not to be a <unk> thing and <unk> .
but I was <unk> this <unk> , wonderful <unk> , <unk> a conversation between <unk> and this thing <unk> and <unk> that <unk> and <unk> that it wasn 't <unk> .
So how much I <unk> that story is going to change a little bit as I 'm going to <unk> up at a time .
This idea , I was when I was <unk> , " <unk> , <unk> , " and I <unk> in one of the <unk> <unk> where we 're all working on about something and you can 't think that 's going to be a <unk> , that will be the <unk> book .
Not only <unk> , just <unk> the book .
And we start thinking about <unk> this project .
But then I 'm going to try and <unk> it up .
So I <unk> my face on the <unk> and <unk> my <unk> to a <unk> <unk> of the room .
And I said high <unk> , " <unk> , what , both we know that if this book is not going to be <unk> my , right ?
Because as you see I 'm <unk> with everything I have , I don 't have more of that .
So if you want it to be better , you have to <unk> and do your part .
OK . But if you don 't do that , you know what , I 'm going to do anything .
I started writing the same because it 's my job .
And I want you to <unk> that it was <unk> that I <unk> to do my part . " Because at the end is so , OK -- -- <unk> does it in the <unk> of the North Africa <unk> people <unk> to the <unk> to the <unk> of the moon , music <unk> forward for hours to <unk> .
And they were always <unk> , because the <unk> were <unk> and they were <unk> .
But every once and <unk> , something that is , and one of these <unk> artists actually <unk> .
And I know you know what I 'm talking about , because I know you 've all seen it , at some point , a <unk> like this .
It was like the time , and the <unk> <unk> through a kind of <unk> and <unk> through a kind of <unk> and it wasn 't doing anything different from <unk> , like <unk> <unk> first , but everything was <unk> .
And suddenly they don 't just know how a human .
But they <unk> up and <unk> <unk> and <unk> in the fire of <unk> .
And when this <unk> , at the time , people <unk> what was , they <unk> with his name .
<unk> your hands and <unk> to <unk> , " <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , God , God , " God . "
That 's God , you know .
<unk> <unk> -- when the <unk> <unk> <unk> , they <unk> the <unk> of <unk> , they <unk> this <unk> with them and the <unk> <unk> in the <unk> , " <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , " <unk> , " <unk> , " <unk> , " that you can still feel in the <unk> or in <unk> .
In <unk> , when a artist has done something impossible and <unk> , " <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> -- a <unk> of God .
And it 's <unk> because we need it .
But , the problem comes the next day , for the <unk> itself , when you <unk> and <unk> that are 11 of the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> it of God is no longer .
It 's just a <unk> with a big deal of <unk> , and maybe you never <unk> to <unk> that <unk> .
And maybe nobody <unk> the name of God <unk> as you know , and what 's going to do with the rest of his life ?
It 's hard .
This is one of the most <unk> <unk> to do in a <unk> life .
But maybe it 's not to be so <unk> if you can 't believe , <unk> , that the most <unk> of your being come from you .
But just <unk> that you can get <unk> from a <unk> source of this <unk> part of your life that you have to go to <unk> when you 're done to <unk> .
And , you know , if we think it 's all about that way .
And so I started to <unk> , and it 's <unk> as I <unk> it for several months during the <unk> of the book that I would soon be , the <unk> , <unk> of my success ,
And what I have to continue <unk> when I feel <unk> from that is , not <unk> .
Don 't go . You just have your work .
<unk> to <unk> for your side , whatever can be .
If your work is <unk> , you 'll be <unk> .
If the <unk> , you 'll <unk> <unk> to you would want to <unk> some kind of <unk> , for just a moment through your <unk> , " <unk> ! "
<unk> , you do the same your <unk> .
And " <unk> ! " and you 're going to be .
I think that 's going to be <unk> .
" <unk> ! " <unk> ! " and you 're just for having had love human and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Thank you .
Thank you .
<unk> <unk> : <unk> !
As you know I 've already talked about some of these projects on the human genome , what it can <unk> and the discovery of genes .
We 're going to <unk> a new path : we started <unk> biology and now starting from that digital code , we 're <unk> in a new <unk> of biology , and <unk> life .
We 've always been trying to <unk> big questions .
" What is life ? " It 's something that many <unk> , I think have <unk> to do various levels .
We 've been trying to <unk> in the <unk> terms .
We 're <unk> for about 20 years now .
When we <unk> the human genome <unk> to go through the <unk> world of biology to the digital world of the computer .
Now , we 're going to <unk> life , or create new life life on this digital universe ?
This is a map of a little <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> , which is the species from the <unk> genome between the ones that can <unk> in the lab .
And we tried to reduce the genome to <unk> a even smaller one .
We can <unk> a <unk> of genes about 500 that are here .
But when we look at his map , it 's <unk> simple than our .
<unk> , that 's simple .
But when we look at all the genes that we can <unk> , one at the time , is very <unk> that this can bring to a cell <unk> cell .
So I thought the only way to <unk> was <unk> this <unk> so that they could <unk> the <unk> to <unk> some of these questions .
And so we started the <unk> of " Can we <unk> a <unk> ? "
Can the chemistry to produce these big molecules that we 've never been able to do before we 've been able to make before ?
And , in case , can we make a <unk> ?
A <unk> is just a piece of <unk> material .
The speed with which we can <unk> life is <unk> to <unk> .
Our ability to write the code , instead of <unk> <unk> rather slowly , but it 's <unk> .
And our <unk> results that are <unk> the <unk> on a <unk> .
We 've been <unk> over 15 years ago .
The process has <unk> a lot of <unk> , <unk> with a <unk> <unk> before they <unk> the first experiments .
But we found that <unk> of DNA <unk> is very hard .
There are thousands of cars in the world that <unk> small <unk> of DNA , of 30 to 50 <unk> and it 's a process : <unk> the <unk> is <unk> , <unk> <unk> is a <unk> process .
So we had to develop a new way to <unk> these <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
And this was our first <unk> , from the digital information of <unk> <unk> <unk> .
It 's a small virus that bacteria <unk> .
We designed <unk> , <unk> the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> a DNA <unk> of <unk> and <unk> a DNA <unk> of about <unk> <unk> .
The interesting part is when we took this piece of <unk> material , and we <unk> it in bacteria , the bacteria have <unk> to read this code and <unk> particles .
<unk> particles have been <unk> by cells , they 're <unk> back , and they <unk> the <unk> <unk> .
I 've been talking recently with members of the <unk> industry that they have certainly <unk> this model .
They <unk> more than you .
I think this is a situation where software can actually build its own <unk> in a <unk> system .
But we wanted to do the largest things .
We had to build the entire <unk> of <unk> .
They 're more than <unk> <unk> of code .
So we thought we 're going to <unk> the size of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> , so that we can change the <unk> cell .
<unk> is <unk> , and if you <unk> information <unk> in a computer , they have to be very <unk> .
When we first <unk> this genome for the first time in <unk> , the standard <unk> was a <unk> for every 10 <unk> <unk> .
We 've discovered , <unk> , 30 <unk> . If you were using that original sequence , you 'd never <unk> to do it work .
One part of the process is to design <unk> 50 <unk> that <unk> with all the other <unk> of 50 <unk> to build smaller <unk> <unk> to build <unk> smaller <unk> that together .
<unk> elements here .
You probably read that you read about it .
<unk> <unk> : We have a <unk> code on four <unk> : A , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> and <unk>
<unk> of those <unk> <unk> together <unk> about 20 <unk> , and there 's a <unk> order of <unk> for every <unk> .
So we can use the code to write words , <unk> , <unk> .
What we did is <unk> .
Some of them have been <unk> by the fact that it wasn 't <unk> .
We designed these <unk> to just <unk> with <unk> .
There are <unk> that <unk> them and <unk> them .
And we started <unk> with <unk> <unk> <unk> .
In every step we 've produced these <unk> in <unk> so that we can <unk> <unk> , because we 're <unk> to create an extremely <unk> <unk> <unk> as you 'll see in a minute .
We 're trying to <unk> the process .
So this seems to be a <unk> of <unk> .
When you start these <unk> <unk> , a lot more than 100 <unk> <unk> , you don 't have to be directly in the <unk> <unk> .
You get to the <unk> of the <unk> tools of <unk> biology .
So we 've <unk> other <unk> .
<unk> of another <unk> called <unk> , which in biology <unk> to <unk> the DNA that can <unk> the <unk> .
Here 's an example .
This <unk> , called <unk> <unk> , can <unk> three million <unk> of <unk> .
You can see in the <unk> <unk> like his <unk> is <unk> .
In 12 -- it 's been <unk> just as it was before .
<unk> thousands of organisms that are able to do that .
These organisms can completely <unk> .
We 're going to live under <unk> .
I 'm absolutely sure life in space , and they <unk> to find new <unk> of water .
Actually , NASA 's shown that this happens .
This is a picture of the <unk> that we 've built these <unk> , just using these <unk> , just using these <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> them <unk> .
This image was not <unk> with a <unk> <unk> , but with a <unk> <unk> .
It 's such a <unk> that we can <unk> with a <unk> <unk> .
These are pictures that <unk> a period of about six seconds .
This is the <unk> that we 've done a little bit of time ago .
They 're more than <unk> code <unk> .
It 's the largest <unk> structure ever <unk> by man .
It 's got <unk> <unk> to 300 million .
If you <unk> it with a <unk> 10 <unk> , without spaces , you 'll have a <unk> <unk> pages to <unk> this code .
Now , how do we make it work ? How can we <unk> it ?
<unk> , <unk> , it 's a <unk> .
It 's a little bit more <unk> when you use bacteria .
It 's easier even when it comes to <unk> cells like our <unk> : you just <unk> the <unk> and <unk> another , which is basically the <unk> of <unk> .
In <unk> , the <unk> is <unk> in the cell , but we have <unk> <unk> that we are able to make a <unk> <unk> of a cell to another cell <unk> on another cell and <unk> .
We <unk> a <unk> <unk> from a species .
<unk> are different as men from <unk> .
We <unk> some <unk> in the way that we could decide what this <unk> to .
And then he <unk> with the <unk> so that they <unk> all the <unk> .
And when we put it in the cell <unk> , and we <unk> our <unk> the new <unk> went back into the cell .
And we had to <unk> that we don 't have to go beyond , but we tried still <unk> in <unk> .
This is one of the biggest <unk> of evolution .
We found that <unk> species have <unk> a second or a third <unk> somewhere , <unk> in a second thousands of new <unk> to that species .
So , who thinks about evolution as a <unk> , <unk> at the time you <unk> , you know , you know , you know , like a <unk> at a time they think about biology .
We 're going to be <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> the DNA .
The <unk> that was in the cell didn 't <unk> one .
The <unk> <unk> we have <unk> .
It 's <unk> , and it <unk> the other <unk> as a <unk> material , has <unk> it , and we <unk> with just the cell and the new <unk> .
It 's become blue because of the genes that we 've <unk> .
And in a short <unk> of time , all the <unk> of a species have to go <unk> , and it 's <unk> of everything in a new species , <unk> on the new software that we <unk> in the cell .
All the <unk> are <unk> , the <unk> are <unk> , and when you <unk> the code <unk> , they 're going to what we 've <unk> you .
Now , this may seem <unk> <unk> , but by <unk> software , but by <unk> the software , we can change things in a pretty <unk> way .
Now , I 've already <unk> that 's not about <unk> -- but in progress from three million years and a half years , and I 've already told that maybe we 're going to create a new version of <unk> <unk> that <unk> new <unk> <unk> new <unk> process .
Why do that ?
I think it 's pretty <unk> when we think about our <unk> .
We 're going to go from six and a half billion people in the next 40 years .
Just to give an example : I was born in <unk> .
Now there are three people on the planet to <unk> in <unk> ; in 40 years , there 's four .
We 're <unk> problems now to find food , water and <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , six and a half billion people .
We 're going to have to do it for nine billion .
We were more than five billion <unk> , more than 30 billion <unk> .
That means a hundred million <unk> a day .
When we try to find <unk> <unk> , or any kind of process to <unk> , it will be a huge challenge .
In more we have to realize that we have to <unk> the <unk> of CO2 from these materials that we <unk> into the atmosphere .
At day , because of <unk> to <unk> around the world , we have a <unk> with about 20 million genes , and I like to think that are the <unk> <unk> for the future .
The <unk> industry is only about a <unk> of <unk> , and you think about how many different things are out .
Our <unk> here are <unk> data from the <unk> reality and our imagination .
Now we have <unk> , because of these <unk> <unk> of <unk> , able to create what we call what we call <unk> <unk> .
We can make a big robot that can produce a million <unk> a day .
Think about <unk> these 20 million genes or <unk> to <unk> the <unk> to produce <unk> or <unk> , new <unk> , can change , because of a small team , and create more <unk> biology now that in the last 20 years of science .
And it 's just a standard <unk> .
We can choose to <unk> , <unk> <unk> , chemistry or <unk> , <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
This is a <unk> of some software <unk> that we 're working on to be able to <unk> and design species on the computer .
Well , we don 't know how they 're going to be .
We know exactly how their <unk> code .
We 're now <unk> on the <unk> generation .
You 've also seen that <unk> from <unk> was an experiment .
We 've <unk> second and third generation that we 're going to be pretty soon from <unk> to <unk> <unk> as the <unk> or <unk> <unk> .
But the only way that biology can have a big impact without <unk> the cost of food and <unk> the <unk> would be CO2 as well as as the as the as the biology that we 're working in the cells that are doing this , and we think that we can have the first <unk> <unk> in about 18 months .
<unk> <unk> with CO2 is a <unk> , but in our <unk> <unk> around the world , we found different <unk> .
This is a <unk> that we <unk> in <unk> .
We <unk> in the deep ocean , about <unk> meters of <unk> water .
We 're <unk> by CO2 using hydrogen <unk> as <unk> as hydrogen <unk> .
We 're trying to understand whether we can <unk> CO2 , that can easily be <unk> through <unk> , <unk> that CO2 in <unk> , to drive this process .
So , the short <unk> we think we might be able to <unk> what the basic question is , " what life is , " We , we have the <unk> goal to <unk> the entire industry .
<unk> . If you can 't do it from TED , where can you ?
It 's a <unk> source of energy .
<unk> , we 're working on using the same <unk> to create <unk> .
You 've seen this year with flu , we 're always back a year and with a dollar in less when it 's about finding the right now .
I think what you can change is building <unk> in <unk> .
So , here 's how the future could start to look <unk> , now , the tree of evolution , <unk> with bacteria , <unk> , and finally <unk> cells .
We 're so far from <unk> people .
Our goal is to make a long enough of living in order to try to <unk> . Thank you very much .
I 'm going to do all , I 'm going to quickly , some <unk> work , in the new technology that we 've taken to <unk> at <unk> <unk> to a year ago . This is <unk> .
This is a environment where you can <unk> is at local level that <unk> with a huge amount of data .
Here we 're seeing <unk> <unk> of <unk> photos with a kind of <unk> <unk> and <unk> , for a <unk> <unk> , <unk> images like we want .
And it doesn 't matter how big the amount of information that we see , how big it is that there are <unk> of data or data images .
Most of them are common photographs , but this is a <unk> <unk> by the <unk> of <unk> , and <unk> in the <unk> of 300 <unk> .
It 's not going to make any difference because the only thing that <unk> the <unk> of a system like this is the number of <unk> on your screen at any time . It 's also a very <unk> architecture .
This is a whole book , example of data , not of images .
This is the <unk> <unk> of <unk> . Every <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
So to <unk> that 's just <unk> and not of images , we can do something like that , to actually <unk> that 's a real <unk> of the text , not of a picture .
It could be a way to read a little bit of a <unk> <unk> .
You don 't know that .
This is a more <unk> example . This is a <unk> number of The <unk> .
Every image is the beginning of a <unk> .
And it really gives you the pleasure and the <unk> experience to read the real version of a <unk> or a <unk> , which is for nature a <unk> of a <unk> .
We also did something with the <unk> of this particular number of The <unk> .
We created a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> than what you use in a normal <unk> , and we 've <unk> you <unk> content .
If you want to see the <unk> of this <unk> , you can see them here .
Or other models , or even <unk> <unk> .
And this really <unk> some of these ideas to <unk> the <unk> of space on the screen .
We 're going to be able to <unk> to the <unk> and other <unk> <unk> , and other <unk> <unk> .
Of course , <unk> is one of the most <unk> <unk> for this kind of technology .
And I don 't want to lose time , if not to say that we have <unk> <unk> to give it to this field .
These are all the streets in the <unk> image above a NASA <unk> .
So now we 're going to do something else .
This is actually alive on the Web ; you can see it .
This is a project called <unk> , which <unk> two different technologies .
One is <unk> and the other is a <unk> research that was very interesting that made by <unk> <unk> , a <unk> student of Washington , with the <unk> of Washington , with the help of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> . A <unk> .
And it 's alive on the Web , <unk> by <unk> .
You can <unk> when we do this kind of <unk> , where we can go from one image to the other and have this kind of experience .
But the <unk> <unk> of the images here actually actually has meaning .
<unk> <unk> <unk> , and these things are all <unk> <unk> these images together , so that they <unk> to the <unk> <unk> on the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> on the <unk> <unk> <unk> have been <unk> . And here you see the elements of a <unk> or <unk> <unk> , and these things are all <unk> at the level .
I don 't know if I have time to show you some other environment .
There are a few more <unk> .
I want to go directly to one of the <unk> of the <unk> data , and this is from a <unk> <unk> that we did for the first time to show you what we did is really the key behind this technology , the <unk> technology , the <unk> technology . And it 's not <unk> <unk> by the <unk> that we have <unk> in the website .
We had to <unk> some <unk> and so on .
This is a <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> and <unk> images of kinds of <unk> in <unk> , other <unk> and so on . And they 're saying . We 're going to <unk> a picture that 's discovery .
So they 're all <unk> images and <unk> and they 're all <unk> on the <unk> level like this .
And it 's possible to <unk> this <unk> way .
You know , I would never have thought of <unk> , to work .
It 's very <unk> <unk> <unk> this kind of <unk> here .
I think we 're going to see that this is a lot of different kinds of <unk> : from the cell phones to those <unk> <unk> , a <unk> number , <unk> together in this environment .
And if I can , I can , I try to look for the <unk> ones .
A lot of them to <unk> , etc .
There 's a series of photographs here -- <unk> .
This is a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
We can go from <unk> to <unk> physics of this environment .
The <unk> point is that we can do things with social environment . This is now <unk> data from <unk> by the entire memory of how to <unk> the land , from the perspective of how to <unk> the land , from the perspective of <unk> <unk> and <unk> all that data .
All those pictures become <unk> together , greater than the <unk> of the parts .
You have a model of the entire <unk> <unk> .
Think about this as the <unk> of the work of <unk> <unk> on Earth 's work .
It 's something that we <unk> as people as <unk> , and the <unk> that they <unk> it , and the <unk> that they <unk> it with the use .
Their pictures are <unk> with <unk> by other people .
If someone comes the idea of <unk> all of these <unk> <unk> , my <unk> picture of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> the pictures of all that data , and I can use it as a <unk> point in that space , using the <unk> of anyone , and have a social experience <unk> and <unk> .
Of course , a <unk> of all this is <unk> that are extremely <unk> of every interesting part of the land , <unk> not just from <unk> and <unk> and images , but from <unk> .
Thank you very much .
Chris Anderson : I realized what your software ? What your software will you do is that at some point , in the next few years , all the photographs that are going to be <unk> together ?
<unk> : Yeah . What 's doing is basically to find out .
It 's creating <unk> , if you want , between images .
And it 's <unk> it 's <unk> .
The thing becomes very interesting if you think about the <unk> of information that a lot of these <unk> images .
As you do a <unk> of images on the Web , you <unk> a <unk> and the text on the page has a lot of information about the images .
Now , what happens if that picture is going on to all your pictures ?
So the amount of <unk> <unk> and the amount of <unk> that <unk> is really huge . It 's a <unk> effect .
CA : <unk> , it 's really amazing .
<unk> : I 'm going to tell you a lot .
One of the major <unk> when you <unk> and one of the <unk> research is that they can live between who has no <unk> <unk> , between who <unk> the past in the wind , the <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of plants .
We want to think that <unk> are still <unk> beyond the <unk> <unk> , or that <unk> <unk> are still <unk> of <unk> , or that <unk> are still <unk> of <unk> , to <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> , and that the <unk> of the <unk> , and that the idea that the world in which we live in which , but it 's only a model of reality .
the <unk> of a particular <unk> of <unk> choices that our <unk> has done , good or evil , a lot of <unk> .
And of course , everybody <unk> of the <unk> <unk> .
Everybody <unk> . Everybody <unk> .
We 're <unk> to <unk> .
We have to deal with the <unk> of death , so we don 't know if we <unk> and <unk> --
We all have an art .
What <unk> is the <unk> of the song , the <unk> of every culture 's <unk> .
It doesn 't matter that <unk> are the <unk> of <unk> , or the <unk> of <unk> <unk> , or the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> , the <unk> of <unk> , or a <unk> in the <unk> .
He was my <unk> of journey in <unk> a month ago , or a <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> , on <unk> , on <unk> , on <unk> , the <unk> <unk> 's <unk> .
All of these <unk> that are <unk> us to have other ways of thinking , other ways of moving around the world .
And if you look at a moment , it 's a concept that can give you hope .
<unk> , the <unk> of <unk> of the world create a <unk> of life and <unk> that <unk> the planet and it 's important for the <unk> of the planet as the <unk> <unk> known as a <unk> <unk> .
And you can think about this <unk> <unk> as a <unk> and you can <unk> the <unk> of all the <unk> , and you can <unk> the total <unk> of all the <unk> , <unk> <unk> into being by the human imagination of the <unk> of the <unk> .
<unk> is the great <unk> of humanity .
It 's the <unk> of what we are and what we can be as <unk> species .
And <unk> <unk> was <unk> <unk> <unk> was <unk> in <unk> and <unk> much faster .
<unk> , for example , <unk> that 50 percent of all species has been or is on the <unk> of the <unk> just because it 's <unk> , or -- in the <unk> <unk> -- in the field of <unk> diversity -- and you don 't even get to the <unk> <unk> -- that of the diversity of <unk> .
The <unk> of that is , of course , the <unk> <unk> .
When you 're <unk> <unk> <unk> on this planet .
A language is not only <unk> by a <unk> or a series of rules .
A language is the <unk> of the human spirit .
It 's the medium that the <unk> of every culture comes into the world .
Every language is a forest of mind , a <unk> , a <unk> of <unk> possibilities .
And of those <unk> <unk> , as we 're sitting here in <unk> , at least half is no longer <unk> in the <unk> of children .
They 're no longer <unk> to children , which means less than <unk> something , which are already dead .
What 's more <unk> than being <unk> by <unk> , the last <unk> , the last one to talk about the language , the <unk> of <unk> or <unk> the <unk> of children ?
This <unk> <unk> was someone in the world every two weeks , every two weeks , every two weeks , a <unk> <unk> and door with itself in the <unk> <unk> of a <unk> language .
And I know that some of you know , " <unk> 't you better ?
The world wouldn 't be a better place if we all the same language ? " <unk> , then we all talk about <unk> . <unk> .
<unk> <unk> .
We 're going to talk about a <unk> what it means not to be able to talk about your own language .
Today I 'd like to take you on a journey through the <unk> --
a small journey in the <unk> to give you a <unk> of what we 're <unk> .
Most of us <unk> that when I say " different ways of <unk> . " I mean , " I mean , " very different ways of <unk> .
<unk> for example , <unk> this <unk> , in <unk> <unk> , the <unk> of <unk> , which <unk> to the <unk> of <unk> from the river <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> .
It 's a <unk> that 's not able to <unk> the blue color in the green because the <unk> is <unk> in the <unk> of the forest , which <unk> the <unk> .
They have a <unk> language and a <unk> rule , <unk> " <unk> " <unk> " : you have to <unk> a different language .
And this has been <unk> in the past <unk> , though , is that in these <unk> families where you talk about six or seven <unk> because of the <unk> <unk> nobody 's making anybody .
They <unk> to listen and then we start talking .
<unk> one of the most interesting <unk> I 've lived with , the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , an incredible <unk> that has had the first <unk> in <unk> .
In <unk> , five <unk> have <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> .
They 've done by the top photographs that <unk> them in <unk> that <unk> <unk> , <unk> that this <unk> of the <unk> forest had never seen anything .
They <unk> the photos from the ground , they <unk> to <unk> a form or a <unk> , and they don 't know anything , they have <unk> <unk> <unk> , and they <unk> the five <unk> with <unk> .
But <unk> not only <unk> them .
They 're <unk> with each other .
<unk> percent <unk> <unk> was <unk> by their own .
We 're <unk> to eight <unk> and found two <unk> of death and <unk> when we <unk> to know , they <unk> that one of them was <unk> so that he died , and then they <unk> it . And they <unk> it . And they <unk> it . And they <unk> it . And they <unk> it .
<unk> were able to recognize the animal <unk> from 40 <unk> and to <unk> the species .
In the early ' <unk> , I was a really interesting job when my <unk> <unk> , I was <unk> , when my <unk> <unk> , I was <unk> to <unk> between <unk> society and <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
To make sense of <unk> , I should have a <unk> culture , and that <unk> is not <unk> <unk> .
It 's a very <unk> view of the world .
Very interesting .
If you <unk> to <unk> the great <unk> of the world , what do you do ?
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , etc .
A continent comes out , thinking about <unk> Africa has no <unk> <unk> . And instead , and you know , it 's not the other than the <unk> of these <unk> <unk> very <unk> <unk> during the <unk> <unk> .
What makes <unk> interesting is the <unk> of life and death .
So the <unk> are <unk> the <unk> .
<unk> can be <unk> by the <unk> <unk> , <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> and <unk> <unk> to the <unk> of the live in such that for a short <unk> , the <unk> becomes the <unk> .
So , the <unk> <unk> <unk> go to <unk> to talk about God .
We <unk> in <unk> and <unk> God . "
And from the moment that you 're <unk> , is the spirit that <unk> you can <unk> you , how about <unk> ?
So , you start to these incredible events : <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a rather strong in the power of the body , when it 's <unk> in a state of <unk> <unk> .
<unk> all the <unk> that I 've lived with the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , in the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , in the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> of <unk> civilization that once <unk> on the <unk> <unk> of <unk> in <unk> , the <unk> <unk> on the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> on the <unk> <unk> .
In a <unk> continent , this <unk> has never been <unk> by <unk> .
In <unk> , I 'm <unk> by a <unk> , but their <unk> is extraordinary .
<unk> <unk> are <unk> by <unk> to three or four , and they live in a world <unk> and <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> for 18 years .
Two <unk> years of <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of <unk> , now I <unk> in the <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
For all this time , they are <unk> to the values of their society , values that <unk> their <unk> and only their <unk> <unk> <unk> -- or to say the <unk> <unk> .
At the end of this incredible <unk> , they <unk> out and for the first time in their lives , at the age of 18 , see an <unk> . And in that moment of the first <unk> , when the sun <unk> the <unk> <unk> , all they have been <unk> out and the first time in his <unk> is <unk> all over his <unk> . <unk> does a <unk> go and says ,
" <unk> ? I 'm going to tell you how I told .
It 's <unk> . Now it 's <unk> to you . "
They 're <unk> and they 're saying that we , <unk> <unk> , we are the <unk> of the world .
This level of <unk> is extremely important .
When we think about the <unk> <unk> and the environment <unk> and the old history of <unk> <unk> , which is a <unk> concept in his <unk> or maybe <unk> <unk> <unk> and say that these <unk> are closer to Earth .
<unk> <unk> are not <unk> or <unk> by <unk> .
There 's no space for these things in the <unk> of <unk> or <unk> in the <unk> of <unk> , but because of time and <unk> , they 've created a <unk> of the Earth <unk> <unk> , but on a <unk> <unk> -- but on a <unk> <unk> -- but on a <unk> <unk> <unk> : the concept that the Earth can only live because it 's <unk> by human consciousness .
What does that mean ?
Let 's say that a <unk> of the <unk> that <unk> the mountain is a <unk> spirit that <unk> its <unk> is going to be a human being , and it 's going to be <unk> different relationship with the mountain or that place a <unk> <unk> that <unk> a mountain is a <unk> <unk> to <unk> .
which is a spirit of a spirit or a <unk> <unk> is <unk> .
What 's interesting is the <unk> that <unk> the relationship between <unk> and the natural world .
I grew up in the <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> to be <unk> .
That made me made me a human being different from my <unk> friends who believe that <unk> are the <unk> of <unk> and the <unk> <unk> of <unk> and the <unk> <unk> that live on the <unk> <unk> of the world , <unk> that live in the <unk> <unk> .
If you start <unk> that these <unk> can be different , we could actually start to understand some of their <unk> <unk> . They <unk> this <unk> .
I <unk> this photograph in <unk> in the <unk> <unk> .
Some of you may have heard about <unk> , the most powerful <unk> of the <unk> <unk> .
What makes <unk> is not the potential of <unk> , but his <unk> . It 's <unk> by two elements .
On one side , this <unk> <unk> a series of <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
<unk> the only <unk> is a <unk> <unk> that <unk> a little bit , but it 's <unk> with the <unk> of a <unk> 's family in the <unk> said <unk> .
This <unk> <unk> <unk> , very similar to <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
If you ever see the <unk> <unk> <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> that <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> that <unk> on the <unk> is a little bit like being <unk> by a <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> on a sea of electricity . [ <unk> ] [ <unk> ] . <unk> <unk> a <unk> of reality .
I often <unk> with my <unk> , Richard <unk> , the man who <unk> was <unk> , with his discovery of the <unk> <unk> in the ' <unk> .
<unk> to my <unk> , you can 't <unk> these <unk> as <unk> because if you 've done you can 't tell anybody to be <unk> . And the <unk> can 't be <unk> because they 're <unk> by a <unk> that is , of course in <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
It 's possible to <unk> only if you <unk> with other <unk> <unk> that <unk> .
Now , it 's the <unk> that are in this <unk> are <unk> of <unk> , the same kind of <unk> to <unk> the <unk> . The question <unk> <unk> : in a <unk> of <unk> species of plants , how do these <unk> <unk> two <unk> <unk> not similar , but what if you <unk> in this way , they create a <unk> version that 's <unk> <unk> ?
We use the great <unk> of evidence and <unk> , which can <unk> .
But if you go to the <unk> , we 'll be <unk> , " plants they talk . "
What does that mean ?
This <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in the forest , and that <unk> <unk> in the forest , and that our eyes <unk> in the same species .
If you <unk> them as they <unk> their <unk> , they will be , " they 'll <unk> them , " <unk> " <unk> . "
The solution is : they take the <unk> <unk> in a night moon <unk> and <unk> <unk> with a different <unk> .
And that 's not <unk> to <unk> , but it 's a much more interesting than <unk> <unk> .
Now , the problem is that those of us who have <unk> <unk> them , but somehow <unk> <unk> them , but somehow <unk> to the <unk> of history of history , and <unk> .
In fact , the <unk> century , in 300 years , not <unk> <unk> for his <unk> or his <unk> <unk> , but rather like the <unk> was where we <unk> and <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> the mass <unk> of diversity and <unk> and <unk> on the planet . Now the problem is not the change .
All <unk> through <unk> have been <unk> in a <unk> for new possibilities of life .
And the problem is not technology .
<unk> <unk> have no <unk> to be <unk> when they put <unk> and <unk> <unk> as the <unk> <unk> have no <unk> to be when they <unk> to be <unk> when they <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
It 's not the change or technology that <unk> the <unk> of <unk> . It 's the power .
The <unk> <unk> of <unk> .
And if you look at the world , you 'll see that these are not <unk> <unk> to <unk> .
They are <unk> creatures and <unk> <unk> out of existence by <unk> forces that go beyond their ability to <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> --
a <unk> <unk> <unk> , in <unk> <unk> , a <unk> that has lived in the forest to a generation <unk> to a generation <unk> , and now <unk> to the <unk> and the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> , where you can see the <unk> <unk> from the <unk> <unk> <unk> , where the <unk> <unk> <unk> , where the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , where the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , where the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> ,
We 're going to <unk> the <unk> with the <unk> to the forest .
Or in the case of <unk> , are the diseases that are <unk> with the discovery of <unk> .
If you <unk> on the <unk> of the <unk> , where I 'm doing a lot of research , you 'll see the <unk> of politics .
As <unk> the <unk> , the physics of a <unk> , is <unk> <unk> , but <unk> , the <unk> of <unk> 's life of a <unk> , not only is <unk> , but <unk> <unk> in certain <unk> , because it 's part of the development of development .
And you can 't understand the <unk> of the <unk> until you start .
I <unk> miles from <unk> in the Western China through the <unk> <unk> , <unk> to <unk> with a young <unk> , but only <unk> <unk> to the <unk> that we can talk about .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> million people <unk> from the <unk> during the <unk> <unk> .
The father of this guy was <unk> to the <unk> <unk> .
which means that it 's been <unk> in the <unk> of Chinese <unk> .
<unk> <unk> is <unk> with <unk> <unk> during the <unk> who led the <unk> in <unk> .
My mother was <unk> and his <unk> was being <unk> .
It 's taken to <unk> in <unk> at age two <unk> years of his <unk> , because he couldn 't have no <unk> .
The <unk> , who did the same , was <unk> in <unk> .
And one day he <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> , and for this <unk> , was <unk> to work for seven years .
The <unk> of <unk> can be <unk> , but the <unk> spirit of the <unk> of the <unk> is from the present .
And then , finally , it <unk> a choice .
Do you want to live in the <unk> world or we want to <unk> the world of diversity of diversity ?
The great <unk> <unk> <unk> , before he died said that his greatest fear was that , in our <unk> <unk> vision of the world , not only to <unk> the entire <unk> of human imagination to a <unk> <unk> of human imagination , but a day it would be <unk> us from a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that there were other possibilities .
And it 's <unk> to remember that our species has been <unk> for <unk> years .
The <unk> <unk> , who has given us , <unk> us to the <unk> of <unk> , <unk> the <unk> of <unk> with the <unk> of <unk> , creating the <unk> of <unk> , and we talk about <unk> years ago .
The <unk> world has been <unk> 300 years .
That <unk> story , I don 't believe that we have the answers to all the challenges that we can <unk> in <unk> to come .
When these <unk> <unk> of the world is asked what it means to be human , <unk> with <unk> different <unk> .
And it 's in these answers that we all <unk> the possibility of being what we are , a <unk> species , which has to <unk> all the <unk> and all the <unk> can <unk> . And there 's great moments .
I <unk> this picture on the north of the island of <unk> , when I went to <unk> <unk> with <unk> , and this man , <unk> , <unk> me the wonderful story of his <unk> .
The <unk> government wasn 't always <unk> with the <unk> <unk> and in the <unk> <unk> and in the <unk> to <unk> our <unk> , and we <unk> them in <unk> .
The <unk> of this man <unk> <unk> .
<unk> , <unk> for his life , and she <unk> all the <unk> , and all his <unk> .
You want to know that <unk> don 't <unk> , it 's going to be <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> were made of <unk> fish <unk> in <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> of this guy didn 't <unk> from night or <unk> <unk> , or <unk> .
It 's <unk> away , it <unk> the <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> and <unk> in your hand . When I did it <unk> , they <unk> them , they <unk> them by <unk> them , they <unk> them into a <unk> .
It 's <unk> <unk> on the <unk> of this <unk> , and when <unk> <unk> <unk> , he <unk> a dog .
He <unk> the dog and created a <unk> , with the <unk> <unk> has created a <unk> , has <unk> another dog , and it 's <unk> on the <unk> , <unk> <unk> in <unk> .
What about <unk> with anything ? [ <unk> ] [ <unk> ] and that , in different ways , [ <unk> ] and all the <unk> <unk> of the world .
<unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> government <unk> to <unk> the <unk> of a bigger area of California and <unk> together .
It 's their new <unk> . It 's called <unk> .
It 's a <unk> <unk> . It <unk> all the <unk> resources .
One example of how a <unk> can <unk> with his <unk> .
And , finally , I think it 's pretty <unk> at least who 's been in these <unk> areas of the planet , that they realize that they are not <unk> at all .
For someone is home .
<unk> <unk> of human imagination that <unk> to the <unk> of the time . And for us all , the dreams of these children , like the dreams of our children , they become part of the <unk> hope <unk> .
To end end , we <unk> <unk> , we are <unk> that <unk> never <unk> to anything .
I would say the <unk> --
And they 're not <unk> , but we believe that stories can change the world , and maybe we are the best <unk> to tell the stories of the world . Every month our website <unk> <unk> million <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> our <unk> <unk> .
Our <unk> are <unk> by millions of people .
Our work is <unk> in <unk> to bring our public <unk> in places that are <unk> by how they <unk> they <unk> from how they saw and , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> : the world of <unk> in diversity , and we need to find a <unk> world .
where we <unk> all the <unk> can <unk> our <unk> <unk> .
Thank you .
I 'm going to talk about some things I 've written in this book that I hope to <unk> other you 've heard and <unk> <unk> a few <unk> , in the case you don 't know .
I want to start with what I call the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> of what ?
The <unk> <unk> of all <unk> society will be <unk> . The <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> : " If we want to <unk> the <unk> of our citizens . " The way to do that is to <unk> freedom . "
The reason is , on one side , in the fact that freedom is in itself a value , is <unk> , <unk> for human beings .
On the other is that if we are <unk> , every one of us can do something that we can do , for all of us to do anything that we <unk> our <unk> , without anybody who 's in our own own .
The way to <unk> the freedom is to <unk> choice .
The more of choices , and more <unk> , and more <unk> , and more <unk> is their <unk> .
This , <unk> , is so <unk> <unk> in society that nobody <unk> to <unk> in <unk> .
And it 's also <unk> <unk> in our lives .
I 'm going to show you some examples of what progress has made possible .
This is my <unk> . It 's not particularly big .
I <unk> a simple note on the <unk> to <unk> .
In my <unk> , there are <unk> <unk> , without <unk> the 10 <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> and 12 <unk> you can buy a huge number of <unk> in the <unk> that nobody of <unk> already is <unk> in your <unk> .
Here 's what <unk> is what <unk> is .
Then you go to the <unk> store to buy a <unk> : <unk> , radio , <unk> , <unk> , radio , <unk> , <unk> .
And in this single <unk> store , there 's a big number of <unk> <unk> .
We can do six and a half million different <unk> using the <unk> that there are in one store .
<unk> <unk> that there is <unk> choice .
<unk> <unk> : The world of <unk> .
Once I was a child , when I was a child , you could get all the services <unk> , in <unk> that they were <unk> by <unk> .
You get the phone , you <unk> it .
And a <unk> of that , by the way , was that the <unk> never <unk> .
These days they went .
We have a <unk> of <unk> , especially between cell phones .
Here 's cell cell phones .
My <unk> is in the middle , <unk> <unk> , <unk> of <unk> , and <unk> for the <unk> <unk> .
If you haven 't seen it in the store under the house under the house , you 're very well well to be <unk> .
And what happens is that people <unk> in the <unk> and they ask this question . And you know what the answer is , " No . "
It 's not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn 't make things .
So , in other <unk> of life that are much more important than <unk> , is <unk> the same <unk> of choices .
<unk> <unk> : <unk> no longer in the United States you 're going to <unk> from <unk> and the <unk> <unk> you what you have to do .
Instead , <unk> from <unk> , and the <unk> says , " OK , we could do A , or <unk> , or " he has these <unk> and these <unk> <unk> , and these <unk> " <unk> have these <unk> and <unk> . What do you want to do ? "
You <unk> him , " <unk> , what do you do ? "
And the <unk> says , " He has these <unk> and these <unk> , and <unk> has these <unk> and <unk> . "
" What do you want to do ? "
And you say , " <unk> if you were me , what do you do ? "
And the <unk> : " But I 'm not her . "
We call the " <unk> <unk> " <unk> " , " <unk> " , " <unk> " <unk> " , " <unk> " <unk> " , " <unk> <unk> . "
But actually , it 's not a <unk> the weight and responsibility to make decisions from someone who knows something , <unk> the <unk> , <unk> , to <unk> that <unk> , to somebody who doesn 't know anything -- and it 's almost certainly <unk> -- and so not in the <unk> to make decisions about patient ,
There 's a huge <unk> of <unk> products , <unk> to people like me and you , that if you think about it has no sense , because we can 't <unk> .
But if we can 't <unk> , why do we <unk> them ?
The answer is that they want to <unk> , we call the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> that 's as our <unk> , as we have now is a choice of choice , as you see in this <unk> . " We don 't want to <unk> children . They 're not going to have to <unk> .
And we can <unk> how many times we <unk> .
which means that every <unk> , you have to <unk> , you have to decide that kind of person you want to be .
<unk> to the family and <unk> , a <unk> time time time perspective , as almost for anyone , it was that <unk> as soon as possible , and you start to <unk> the <unk> as soon as possible .
The only real choice was that , not when , and you know what to do next .
<unk> , it 's really to play .
They 're going to <unk> very smart , and they <unk> 20 percent less work than a time .
And not because they 're not <unk> , not because they 're less <unk> .
but why am I <unk> , I 'm going to <unk> , " <unk> or not ? "
" Do you have to do you know , I 'm going to think about children or career ?
They 're <unk> <unk> .
And they try to answer these questions , even though this <unk> , although this is not going to be the <unk> that you can 't get the <unk> that you can 't get a beautiful <unk> to my <unk> .
And they have to do that . They 're important questions .
Now , the work : we 're <unk> , as <unk> <unk> , because technology <unk> us to work every minute , every day , from every day , from every day , from every day , from every <unk> of the planet , <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , there 's a <unk> , and I won 't say anybody , where the <unk> works .
I don 't say that , because I want to use it .
What does , this incredible choice of choice that we have about the work ? It 's that we need to decide , <unk> at any time , whether we have to work or not .
We can go to see our son to play <unk> , with the cell phone in one <unk> , and the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
And even though they are <unk> , every minute that we see our son , we 're also <unk> , " I have to answer this call ? "
" I have to answer this <unk> ? I have to say this letter ? "
And even when the answer is , " no , " that makes that experience a <unk> of your son very different from what would be in other conditions .
So , from any of course , you know , small and big things , materials and <unk> , life is a question of choices .
And once the world was this : <unk> , there were some possibilities , but not everything was a choice of choice .
The world of today is this : The <unk> is , " Is it a <unk> thing , or <unk> ? "
The answer is <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> we all know , so I 'm going to talk about the ones .
We had two <unk> effects of people .
The first , <unk> , is that <unk> instead of <unk> .
With a lot of <unk> between <unk> , it becomes very hard to do .
I 'll give you an example : a study <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
A <unk> of my <unk> has access to <unk> data , <unk> society , with about a million <unk> <unk> in different companies .
What she discovered is that for every 10 <unk> that are <unk> , the <unk> of <unk> <unk> of two percent .
With 50 <unk> <unk> , there 's 10 percent less <unk> than <unk> when they 're only <unk> from them . Why ?
Because with 50 <unk> <unk> between them , it 's hard to decide , and the choice is <unk> to the <unk> .
And in <unk> , and still <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and of course <unk> , and <unk> , and of course <unk> never comes .
<unk> that doesn 't mean just means that these <unk> <unk> food to <unk> because they don 't have enough money , he wants to say that the decision is so <unk> that they <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of work .
They 're not <unk> , they 're <unk> up to five <unk> per year from <unk> of work , who would be well <unk> to <unk> .
So <unk> is a <unk> of having <unk> choices .
And I think that 's going to change the world like this .
" And then , to end the <unk> : <unk> , <unk> or <unk> ? "
You just make the right decision , if it 's <unk> , right ?
You don 't want to choose the wrong <unk> , and you 'll get the wrong <unk> .
So this is the first effect . The second effect is that even though we can <unk> <unk> and make a choice , finally we 're less <unk> by the <unk> of how to <unk> it .
And that 's a number of reasons .
One of them is that with a lot of <unk> between <unk> , if you <unk> one and it 's not perfect , it 's easy to imagine that they could make a different choice that would be better . And what happens is that happens is that the <unk> <unk> us to <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> <unk> by <unk> ,
even when it was a <unk> decision .
The more choices are , the easier is to <unk> than any <unk> that is <unk> of <unk> choice .
<unk> , there 's what <unk> call .
Dan <unk> has <unk> very well <unk> like the value that we give things to things that we <unk> with .
<unk> rest , when there 's a lot of <unk> possible , it 's easy to <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> and <unk> to be less than the <unk> that 's choice .
Here 's an example . I 'm <unk> with all the ones that are not in New York .
But that 's what 's probably <unk> .
There 's this <unk> to <unk> .
A place of <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> . <unk> day . It 's all about them .
It 's not going to be nothing . But what he thinks is , " Well , <unk> . "
" All my <unk> <unk> are away . "
" You 're going to be <unk> in front of home . "
And it <unk> two weeks , the idea that 's going to <unk> -- every day -- the ability to <unk> where it wants .
The <unk> <unk> for what we have , even when the choice was <unk> .
And the <unk> we have from <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , the more <unk> <unk> , you <unk> against how to <unk> .
Here 's another example .
This <unk> tells us a lot of things .
It 's about living the moment , and maybe of living living in slowly .
But the most important point is that anything you want , you to <unk> them to do other .
The things that don 't <unk> have a lot of <unk> that can make less <unk> what we do .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> <unk> .
I tried it on my skin <unk> a new couple of <unk> .
It 's going to be <unk> .
Once the <unk> were just one guy , they <unk> them and they <unk> and <unk> from <unk> , <unk> , only after they had a <unk> and <unk> a lot of times , they <unk> to go well .
So , I started to <unk> a new couple when the <unk> were gone , and I said , " I need a couple of <unk> , this is my <unk> . "
The <unk> said , " Do you want them to <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> ? "
You want them to <unk> or <unk> ? " <unk> " or " <unk> " or " <unk> " ?
" Do you want them to <unk> ? "
" <unk> wants to <unk> or <unk> ? <unk> <unk> <unk> .
I was <unk> , and after a while I was able to say , " I want the guy -- who was the only guy , " I had no idea what it was so for an hour , I <unk> all <unk> <unk> <unk> , then I was the best <unk> of <unk> , and then I was the best <unk> I ever had .
It was the <unk> . With all that choice I had <unk> the best .
But it <unk> me worse .
Why ? I wrote a whole book to <unk> .
And the reason I was worse is that with all the choice of my <unk> were <unk> , the <unk> <unk> to be <unk> .
I had <unk> <unk> . I didn 't know anything about <unk> when I was <unk> just a guy , but when I <unk> 100 different , you 'll be perfect . But when I was going to be 100 different , you know , at least one one had to be perfect .
What I 'd <unk> was good , but not perfect .
After I <unk> that <unk> with what I was <unk> , I was <unk> in <unk> to <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> in the lives of people don 't make the <unk> that these <unk> have <unk> that these <unk> have <unk> to <unk> themselves .
And this <unk> <unk> , even when the results are good .
<unk> in the world of <unk> , if you realize that .
Because if you <unk> it , I don 't know what I 'm talking about .
The truth is to that .
And it was better when it was worse , " Why was it <unk> when it was worse when it was worse , it was <unk> that when it was worse than the <unk> was still <unk> <unk> .
<unk> , in the world that we live in -- <unk> , <unk> <unk> citizens with the <unk> -- the <unk> that we can <unk> is that things are <unk> to the <unk> of <unk> .
You 've never ever never <unk> to <unk> because your <unk> , my <unk> , are <unk> .
The <unk> of happiness -- what you 're here -- is , " <unk> <unk> " Yes , " you want it . "
I mean , little <unk> moment -- that I 'm really <unk> and my wife is really <unk> .
I couldn 't do better , I didn 't have <unk> .
But <unk> is not always a <unk> thing .
<unk> , a <unk> of <unk> a couple of <unk> <unk> when there 's just that kind of <unk> is that when you 're not <unk> , and you say , why ?
Who is <unk> ? " " The answer is <unk> .
The world is <unk> . What can I do do with it ?
When there are hundreds of <unk> <unk> , and you get one <unk> , and you 'll get a <unk> , and you 'll tell who is the <unk> , it 's clear clear that you are you .
We could have better .
With hundreds of <unk> available , there are no <unk> for <unk> .
So when people make decisions , even if the <unk> is <unk> , they <unk> <unk> and give them their own <unk> .
In the last few years , the <unk> is <unk> in the <unk> world .
I think a <unk> <unk> -- not the only , but important -- of this <unk> of <unk> is just that people have <unk> experiences because the standard is too <unk> .
And when they have to <unk> that they think <unk> is them .
So the final result is that we 're better , <unk> , <unk> , but we 'll get worse .
Let me tell you .
This is the <unk> <unk> , what we all take for good and is completely <unk> . It 's not true .
There 's no <unk> that a little bit of choice is better than <unk> at all , but this doesn 't <unk> that much choice is a little bit of a little bit .
There 's a <unk> , <unk> . I don 't know what it is .
But I 'm sure we 've <unk> from a piece of the level where the choices <unk> our lives .
Now , from a <unk> point -- I 've been almost finished -- from the <unk> 's point of view , <unk> is the <unk> .
What <unk> the whole choice in the <unk> society is the <unk> material .
There are many places in the world , and you know , where the problem is not that they have <unk> choice .
The problem is they have too <unk> .
So the <unk> I 'm talking about is a <unk> <unk> of <unk> , <unk> society .
And what <unk> does <unk> and <unk> is this : <unk> <unk> <unk> talked about yesterday about how much those <unk> and <unk> <unk> to <unk> are <unk> . It 's a <unk> of money .
I mean , these choices , <unk> and <unk> , it 's not just that they are <unk> .
They 're <unk> <unk> .
They make us worse .
If a little bit of what in our society <unk> to be <unk> choice was to <unk> in those where people have too few <unk> , it 's not just to their lives to <unk> , but our .
This is what <unk> call a <unk> <unk> .
A <unk> of income does well , not only not the poor -- because of this choice in <unk> that we 're <unk> .
So , to <unk> , " You can get all the stuff you want to be --
<unk> , people of culture , <unk> : " What do you do ? "
" It 's <unk> that you can 't do anything in a glass <unk> . "
" A <unk> imagination , a <unk> vision of the world --
and I <unk> it so , at the beginning .
But then , <unk> , I realized that that that fish knows it long .
Because the reality of the <unk> is that if you <unk> the <unk> , so that " everything is possible , " you can 't <unk> the freedom . It 's <unk> the <unk> .
If you <unk> the <unk> , you know that everything you can <unk> the <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> .
Everybody needs a <unk> .
This is almost certainly too <unk> , maybe even for the fish , and certainly for us .
But the <unk> of some <unk> is a <unk> for <unk> and , <unk> , for <unk> .
Thank you so much .
