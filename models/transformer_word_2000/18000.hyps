<unk> year I showed these <unk> to <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> , which for almost three million years , it was <unk> <unk> , which for almost three million years , <unk> <unk> , <unk> 40 percent .
And I 'm going to <unk> this <unk> of the problem because it 's not <unk> the ice .
<unk> <unk> <unk> is , in a certain sense , the heart <unk> of climate change .
It <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
The next <unk> will be a <unk> <unk> on the <unk> of the last 25 years .
<unk> <unk> are <unk> in red .
You see , you know , it 's <unk> up to the blue blue <unk> .
That 's the ice in <unk> , which <unk> in summer .
You can see that the <unk> ice <unk> , of five years or more , it 's like the blood blood , which is <unk> from the body .
It 's been <unk> .
This is a problem because <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> of the ocean around the <unk> <unk> , where there are huge <unk> of <unk> that , <unk> are <unk> <unk> in <unk> .
<unk> to the <unk> <unk> <unk> from global <unk> , that <unk> <unk> , that <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> this point of not <unk> .
In some <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> already <unk> from the water .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> ! <unk> : She 's good . <unk> : She 's good . The question is if we <unk> it .
A reason is that this <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> from the north .
This is a <unk> river <unk> <unk> .
<unk> had never <unk> <unk> <unk> .
This is the <unk> river , in the <unk> of <unk> .
If you want to know how the <unk> <unk> <unk> to the sea level to the <unk> of the <unk> on <unk> , here is where the sea .
These <unk> are <unk> <unk> .
On the other part of the planet : <unk> , the largest <unk> of the ice .
<unk> month , <unk> scientists have <unk> that the <unk> of ice is in <unk> , and that <unk> <unk> <unk> , which <unk> on some <unk> <unk> <unk> , is <unk> in <unk> .
<unk> at <unk> <unk> <unk> , like <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , the third largest <unk> of ice , <unk> new <unk> , which a few years ago were <unk> .
<unk> percent of the world population <unk> <unk> by that <unk> .
<unk> <unk> : This <unk> is the source of water <unk> of this city .
<unk> is <unk> .
But when you <unk> , the same happens to the <unk> water .
<unk> California <unk> on the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> are <unk> .
<unk> , as you read , they 're <unk> .
<unk> <unk> in the world <unk> to a <unk> increase in the world .
<unk> <unk> are <unk> to a <unk> out of the normal and not <unk> .
<unk> times over the last 30 years than <unk> <unk> .
This is a <unk> of all <unk> .
If you look at the context that you can see the <unk> .
In the last five years we 've <unk> 70 million <unk> of CO2 <unk> every 24 hours -- 25 million <unk> in the ocean every day .
Look at the <unk> <unk> area , from <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and both parts of the <unk> <unk> , where there 's a oxygen <unk> <unk> in the ocean .
The <unk> of global warming , together to <unk> , which is 20 percent , is the use of <unk> <unk> .
The oil is a problem , and <unk> is even worse .
The United States is one of the two countries with <unk> emissions , together .
And it 's <unk> to build a lot of other <unk> .
But we 're <unk> to a <unk> of the direction .
These are the projects <unk> over the last few years and some <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> every way , there 's a <unk> politics in our country .
<unk> <unk> and oil <unk> have <unk> <unk> million dollars in the last year to <unk> <unk> <unk> , which is a <unk> .
I 'm going to give something --
<unk> <unk> , in <unk> , where I live , there was a <unk> of <unk> billion <unk> of <unk> .
Maybe you saw it on the <unk> .
This is the <unk> <unk> <unk> in America .
It 's happened around <unk> .
<unk> <unk> of one of the <unk> <unk> was this .
<unk> : <unk> â™« <unk> <unk> <unk> is a <unk> and happy guy .
It 's <unk> here in America , and it <unk> our economy .
<unk> <unk> is <unk> <unk> .
It 's at good price , <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> here is most <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The largest society <unk> society on the <unk> is <unk> <unk> . This is his <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> <unk> -- not know what they 're talking about .
<unk> : So the <unk> for the <unk> of <unk> has <unk> two <unk> .
This is one of them , one part .
<unk> : <unk> : <unk> <unk> we see the climate change as a <unk> <unk> to our business .
So , our <unk> is <unk> a big amount of money in a <unk> <unk> to make public and <unk> the truth on <unk> .
Actually , <unk> is not <unk> .
We think it 's <unk> -- it 's also a good <unk> .
So we don 't know about climate change .
We could do it .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> : <unk> <unk> -- you 've heard a lot of it .
So , I 'm going to <unk> a <unk> structure for how <unk> <unk> .
<unk> ! <unk> cars are a little bit <unk> , but that 's the sound of the technology of <unk> .
<unk> <unk> is between the main <unk> of global warming , but the <unk> technology of <unk> that you see changes everything .
So , let 's look at this is the <unk> technology .
<unk> : <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to the economic issue and the national security .
<unk> : <unk> is in the crisis ; the national security economy , the national <unk> , the crisis .
The <unk> that <unk> all : our <unk> from the <unk> <unk> , like <unk> and oil <unk> .
Now , but there 's a new <unk> , <unk> solution to <unk> .
<unk> America : 100 percent of energy <unk> , in <unk> .
A plan to <unk> America at work , <unk> <unk> , and help <unk> global warming .
<unk> , a solution that we could solve our problems .
<unk> America . <unk> more .
<unk> : This is the last one .
<unk> : <unk> : It 's about <unk> energy to America .
One of the most <unk> ways to <unk> from the <unk> that <unk> our planet .
<unk> : The future is here . <unk> , a new network .
<unk> <unk> 2 : <unk> <unk> for jobs .
<unk> : <unk> America . It 's time to be <unk> .
<unk> : A old <unk> <unk> says , " If you want to go to <unk> , go .
If you want to go far , you go together . "
We have to go far , quickly .
Thank you very much .
<unk> year at TED , I did a <unk> on <unk> .
And I 'm going to try to <unk> how the car works .
So , I 'm <unk> . And for those who were not , the <unk> is the largest scientific experiment that 's ever <unk> -- <unk> miles away .
His task is to <unk> the conditions that were in the <unk> of the universe -- to <unk> million times a second .
That 's just <unk> .
This is the machine under <unk> .
So , these <unk> <unk> into the <unk> .
This is what I work . It 's called <unk> -- <unk> feet and it 's <unk> feet and it 's <unk> <unk> .
This is a <unk> image of <unk> in building so you can see the <unk> .
<unk> 10 <unk> of the last year we <unk> the machine for the first time .
And this picture was <unk> by <unk> .
It was <unk> <unk> <unk> in control room .
It 's an image of the first <unk> of particles that had done all the <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , with a part of the <unk> , and we <unk> particles inside the <unk> .
In other words , when you look at that image <unk> , <unk> that the car <unk> , which is a big <unk> .
I don 't know if it was this to <unk> us to <unk> or this , when somebody <unk> on Google and I 'll <unk> that the page was this .
That means we 've had a <unk> impact <unk> beyond that scientific .
<unk> a week later , there was a problem with the machine , to just these <unk> here -- these <unk> <unk> .
These <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> when the car works at the <unk> <unk> .
Now , the <unk> between you <unk> the <unk> and <unk> , " It 's not true . I 'm <unk> too <unk> . "
And instead they can do it because when they 're very <unk> become the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
So , <unk> degrees <unk> at <unk> degrees , at a temperature <unk> to the <unk> of space between stars , these <unk> can bring that <unk> .
In one of the <unk> between the <unk> <unk> , there was a <unk> <unk> .
So the <unk> <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> .
This was the result .
Now , this is even <unk> if you think you think that these <unk> <unk> <unk> over 20 <unk> , and that 's <unk> about 30 <unk> .
They <unk> about 50 <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , what we did .
We <unk> them and <unk> .
They 're all <unk> to their <unk> place .
<unk> the end of <unk> <unk> will be new <unk> .
We <unk> it , and we <unk> to get data <unk> or <unk> , and so our <unk> , and so our <unk> to discover what the universe is .
Now , of course , in some way , these <unk> <unk> the value of science and engineering engineering <unk> . It 's easy to <unk> .
I think that 's so hard , the fact that it 's the <unk> of <unk> , I think it 's the value of things like <unk> .
<unk> with the words of a <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , which , <unk> , which , <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> experiments of his <unk> , his <unk> was <unk> <unk> , he said , " It 's not <unk> for the human mind as <unk> that the ideas of human mind as <unk> that the ideas of science are <unk> , and there are no new <unk> .
Thank you .
I want to start <unk> to <unk> <unk> to when , from children , <unk> with <unk> .
<unk> <unk> like <unk> and <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , <unk> , actually , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to the way that we <unk> most of the world around us .
So , from <unk> <unk> from the <unk> of our <unk> with objects , and I <unk> <unk> <unk> , and my <unk> <unk> <unk> , I started <unk> , " And if we use a computer , instead of having the only <unk> <unk> as a digital computer , instead of having the only <unk> <unk> as a digital <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> information with both hands ,
and <unk> to our <unk> ?
The question was so interesting that I wanted to explore the answer , building the answer , building <unk> .
In a few words , a <unk> is a <unk> computer as a <unk> .
In a few words , a <unk> is a <unk> computer as a <unk> .
You can <unk> it with your hand , you can <unk> them , and they can hear their movement and they have a screen and a <unk> radio .
But <unk> , they 're <unk> objects , like <unk> , you can just <unk> .
<unk> are the <unk> of a new <unk> of tools to <unk> information .
And as they become more <unk> , <unk> of their movement , others , and others , and as they become more <unk> , <unk> of their <unk> movement , of the other , how we can explore and <unk> <unk> .
<unk> with some simple example .
This <unk> is <unk> to show you a video : if you <unk> it in a direction , the video <unk> so , if we <unk> on the other hand , <unk> .
These <unk> <unk> are <unk> <unk> of others .
If you <unk> them , they <unk> what they are around .
If they 're <unk> , they <unk> it and they can <unk> it a little bit .
If they 're <unk> , they <unk> it and they can <unk> it a little bit .
They also <unk> their movement and <unk> .
And we realized that one of the interesting <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> was the <unk> that we could use <unk> <unk> on data , for example , a color as if it was a <unk> .
In this case , we have three <unk> <unk> <unk> , and I can <unk> to <unk> the <unk> of color in the central one , where they <unk> .
and I can <unk> to <unk> the central color in the central one , where you 're <unk> .
If we <unk> it too much , we can <unk> it a little bit of a place .
There are also <unk> <unk> <unk> , like <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> where people can try to <unk> things that are <unk> the <unk> that are <unk> the <unk> .
Now I 'm --
This is a <unk> sequence of <unk> I do with a <unk> program .
Here we have a <unk> game that 's in half a <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> , every <unk> <unk> a letter to <unk> a letter , on every <unk> , <unk> , at every <unk> , and as I was <unk> <unk> , and as I was <unk> <unk> <unk> , he <unk> on a <unk> .
And then , after about 30 seconds , and you have a new <unk> of <unk> and new <unk> that we can try .
Thank you .
There 's <unk> children <unk> in <unk> <unk> <unk> , I did <unk> them , and I <unk> them , and I <unk> a video .
They 're very <unk> .
And one of the interesting things of this <unk> <unk> is that you don 't have to give people a lot of <unk> .
I just said , " <unk> " , " and they know exactly what to do .
Here 's other people who <unk> it .
This is our <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , there on the right .
It really wanted to <unk> .
They were just <unk> , for him .
Now , this is a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
We wanted to build a <unk> for the <unk> of <unk> . He 's <unk> .
It can <unk> new characters in the scene , <unk> their <unk> .
It can <unk> new characters in the scene , <unk> their <unk> .
So here 's what 's doing .
<unk> : The sun is <unk> .
David <unk> : Now , he 's taken a <unk> in the scene .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> .
<unk> work ! Yeah !
So , <unk> <unk> and <unk> can <unk> the characters --
<unk> : <unk> !
... <unk> your story .
<unk> : <unk> !
<unk> : It 's a <unk> story with the open , and it can decide it as it <unk> .
<unk> : It 's a <unk> story with the open , and it can decide it as it <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> away , <unk> .
<unk> : The last example I 've got time to show you is a <unk> , <unk> <unk> , to <unk> and <unk> music .
It 's a <unk> , <unk> <unk> , to <unk> and music .
<unk> here are <unk> <unk> as <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> of these have four different <unk> , and you can choose which to use .
And you can also <unk> these <unk> in a sequence from <unk> to <unk> .
And I just <unk> by doing a <unk> sound and a sequence of a sequence .
These are actually <unk> that you can control from the alive , like <unk> and <unk> .
I 'll <unk> it to a particular sound and then <unk> to <unk> .
And then there are the effects of time and <unk> , which <unk> to the entire sequence .
<unk> how it works .
<unk> : <unk> : <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> , " sequence " <unk> " <unk> " " " <unk> " . "
Now let 's take a <unk> line .
<unk> : <unk> : <unk> <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> : And now I 'm <unk> the <unk> to the <unk> , so I can control the effect of the alive .
<unk> : <unk> : I can <unk> the entire sequence <unk> time on one side or the other .
<unk> : <unk> : And now I 'm going to <unk> the <unk> to give <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> : I can <unk> the sequence " flight " flight . "
So I don 't have to <unk> before , but I can <unk> it , <unk> over or <unk> .
And now , finally , I can <unk> the entire sequence <unk> on the left the <unk> <unk> .
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is to build new <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> to how our brain work and body .
And today , I 've had time to show you one of the results of this path , and some <unk> <unk> that we try to get out of the lab .
The concept that I want to <unk> is that 's <unk> this new generation of objects to <unk> the <unk> media , which <unk> information in our world in the way we want .
Thank you very much .
I don 't see the now of talking to all of you .
I 'm a <unk> .
<unk> books is my <unk> , but it 's more than that , of course .
It 's also love and love <unk> of my life .
And I don 't look like to change .
But , I said that , something that 's happened in my life and in my career , which <unk> me to <unk> the whole <unk> with this work .
The particular thing is I <unk> wrote this book , this <unk> called <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , for some reason to <unk> in the world and <unk> a big <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
And the result is that everywhere <unk> , people <unk> me like I was <unk> .
<unk> -- <unk> , <unk> !
<unk> to me now everybody <unk> and say , " You don 't fear of not to be able to do it better ?
You don 't fear to write about the whole life without able to be able to create a book that can <unk> to someone ? "
which can you <unk> to someone ? "
It 's <unk> , you know .
But it could go worse , <unk> , <unk> me that 's <unk> , and I remember , a <unk> -- I was a <unk> -- I wanted to be a <unk> .
I 'm going to <unk> the same <unk> <unk> by fear .
And people say , " Don 't you know , you don 't know to be able to <unk> ?
You don 't fear that the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> ?
You don 't fear to do this <unk> for all life without <unk> that anything is ever out and die on a <unk> of <unk> <unk> with the mouth full of <unk> <unk> ?
So , you know .
The answer -- the short answer to all these questions is , " Yes . "
Yeah , I fear of all those things .
I always had fear .
And I 'm <unk> of many other things that people couldn 't <unk> .
Like <unk> and other things <unk> .
But , as much as I thought , and I 'm <unk> <unk> is why ?
Is it <unk> ?
It 's <unk> that anybody who <unk> <unk> to be <unk> by a job that you feel for <unk> .
But what 's so particular in the <unk> <unk> <unk> to <unk> about health <unk> in a way that other <unk> do not ?
How my father , for example , he was a <unk> <unk> and I didn 't remember one time in his <unk> , in the <unk> of <unk> , when he was asked if she fear to be <unk> ?
<unk> 't it -- that <unk> of <unk> John , how do it ?
<unk> 't you know that , <unk> ?
<unk> , the <unk> engineers like <unk> , they certainly <unk> , <unk> the <unk> of being <unk> <unk> <unk> .
We <unk> , we have enough this <unk> , and not just <unk> but <unk> <unk> , but <unk> of all that , we have this <unk> to be <unk> <unk> .
And I don 't want to look at the <unk> of the dead <unk> <unk> that , just in the <unk> century , <unk> young and often to them .
And the ones that don 't <unk> seem to be really <unk> by their <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , before I die , in the last <unk> said , " Every book , he <unk> me a little bit more " <unk> . " <unk> my work .
But we don 't know when we were saying that , because we 've heard these things so long that we have all <unk> and <unk> the <unk> that creativity and <unk> are <unk> <unk> <unk> that creativity and <unk> are somehow <unk> and that art , at the end , we <unk> to <unk> .
And the question I want to <unk> to all of this today is : are you agree with this idea ?
It 's good for you to do this -- because it 's <unk> from a distance to me , it 's not good for this <unk> .
I think it 's <unk> .
And I think it 's <unk> , and I don 't want to <unk> <unk> in the next century .
I think it 's better <unk> our big <unk> to live .
And I certainly know that , in my case -- it would be very <unk> to start <unk> to that <unk> to <unk> <unk> to <unk> into that <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> in which I 'm in my career .
<unk> -- <unk> look at , I 'm quite young , I 've been about 40 years .
I still have about four <unk> <unk> of work in me .
And it 's very <unk> that anything <unk> of now , it 's going to be <unk> from the world as the work that <unk> after <unk> <unk> of my last book .
<unk> <unk> , because we 're all <unk> <unk> , because we 're all <unk> here -- is <unk> that my greatest success is to my <unk> .
Oh , <unk> , <unk> , who thought !
You know this is the kind of thought that leads a person to start <unk> <unk> at the nine of the morning , and I don 't want to do it .
I 'm going to continue to do this work I love .
So , the question becomes , how ?
And so so , it seems to me , after many <unk> , that the way I work to keep <unk> is to create a <unk> <unk> <unk> , OK ?
I have to do it in some way to find a <unk> distance of me , which I 'm <unk> , and my natural <unk> on which is <unk> to get , and as we could try to find other society , to find other society , to find other society to see whether you can look through time , to find other society to see if you could have better ideas and more <unk> ideas .
about how to help people <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of creativity .
And that research took me to the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
<unk> because I went back to <unk> and then <unk> back .
<unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> -- people don 't believe that creativity <unk> from men , OK ?
It <unk> that creativity was this spirit <unk> <unk> and <unk> to men from some <unk> <unk> and <unk> , for reasons and <unk> <unk> , for reasons and <unk> .
<unk> <unk> these <unk> <unk> <unk> of creativity .
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> to have a <unk> that <unk> <unk> from far .
<unk> were the same idea , but we <unk> that sort of <unk> that kind of spirit without a <unk> .
which is <unk> , because <unk> <unk> don 't really know that a <unk> was somebody particularly smart .
<unk> that a <unk> was this sort of <unk> <unk> that <unk> literally <unk> in the <unk> of the study of a artist , a little <unk> like <unk> <unk> , and <unk> out of <unk> <unk> the job of <unk> the artist and <unk> the result of that work .
<unk> <unk> , that 's the distance I 'm talking -- that <unk> <unk> that <unk> you from the results of your work .
And everybody thought it was so that it <unk> , right ?
So the artists were <unk> by <unk> things , like the too <unk> , for example , right ?
If your work was <unk> , you don 't know , you know , you would all <unk> that <unk> state of <unk> <unk> .
If your work <unk> , it wasn 't all your <unk> , right ?
Everybody <unk> that was your <unk> to be a <unk> .
And so people <unk> <unk> creativity in <unk> for a long time .
And then the <unk> <unk> and all <unk> , and we <unk> this big idea ; we put the human human at the center of the universe above all the <unk> and the <unk> and <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
This was the principle of <unk> <unk> and people started thinking that creativity <unk> completely from <unk> .
And for the first time in history , <unk> to <unk> to this or that artist , as a rather <unk> person with <unk> .
And I have to say , I think it was a big <unk> .
I think I 'm going to <unk> to believe that , as a <unk> person , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> <unk> of all the <unk> <unk> , <unk> and <unk> and <unk> is a <unk> responsibility to <unk> human <unk> .
It 's like to ask someone to <unk> the sun .
<unk> and <unk> completely <unk> the <unk> and creates all these <unk> <unk> on the <unk> .
And I think it was this pressure to have <unk> artists in <unk> 500 years .
And , if that 's true , and I think that 's the question becomes , and now ?
Can we <unk> it ?
<unk> to go back to a <unk> understanding of human relationship between humans and <unk> <unk> .
Or maybe not .
Maybe we can 't <unk> 500 years of thinking in a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And there 's probably people between the audience who <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> on the <unk> of <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , you <unk> people <unk> <unk> on their projects .
You probably don 't <unk> all of this .
But the question I 'd like to <unk> is -- why ?
Why don 't we <unk> this way ?
Because it has more than anything else has ever heard to explain the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> process .
A process that , as anyone who ever <unk> to do something -- so , so basically , everybody knows here -- you know , you don 't <unk> <unk> .
And in fact , it can sometimes look completely <unk> .
I did this <unk> <unk> with the extraordinary <unk> <unk> , who 's been <unk> , who 's been a <unk> for life , and he said that during his <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> out in the <unk> <unk> , <unk> out in the <unk> , <unk> out in the <unk> , and I <unk> it , within the <unk> .
He said to me , like a <unk> <unk> air .
And that <unk> <unk> to her from <unk> .
I <unk> it to get it , because he did <unk> the land under its feet .
I decided to have one thing to do at that point and was , he was , he <unk> , " <unk> as a <unk> . "
And so he was <unk> to the house and it was <unk> by this <unk> , and it would not have to get to <unk> that to take a piece of paper and a <unk> enough <unk> , and <unk> on the page .
<unk> times , we didn 't start to be fast , so <unk> and <unk> and <unk> without able to get home and the <unk> <unk> through and she would <unk> it through the <unk> , and she would <unk> through the <unk> , looking for , as she said , " another <unk> . "
Then there were those times -- this piece never <unk> -- there were some times when the <unk> was almost <unk> , OK ?
So , he was <unk> at home and was looking for the <unk> , through the <unk> , and he was <unk> a <unk> right in the while he was <unk> , and then said , that was like , if you <unk> with the other hand and <unk> .
He <unk> the tail and <unk> in his body and <unk> it on the page .
And in these cases , the <unk> would be <unk> on the <unk> page and <unk> but <unk> , from the last word to the first word .
So when the <unk> <unk> -- it 's <unk> , it 's <unk> to my <unk> process .
Not all my <unk> process -- I 'm not a <unk> !
I 'm a <unk> , and my way of <unk> is ; I 'm <unk> at the same <unk> every day and work and work and <unk> it .
But even me in my <unk> , I <unk> against that thing , sometimes .
And I 'm <unk> that many of you <unk> it .
You know , even if the work and ideas <unk> me <unk> from a certain source I couldn 't <unk> <unk> .
And what is this thing ?
And how can we <unk> it in it , we don 't lose their head , but rather , what 's the <unk> to do ?
So , as I 'm <unk> , the best example I have <unk> <unk> <unk> , which I 've <unk> different years ago for a <unk> .
<unk> of this , and you know , <unk> , for the <unk> of life was the <unk> of the <unk> artist <unk> , trying to control , <unk> , <unk> these <unk> <unk> <unk> .
But then <unk> , he was <unk> , and one day as he was <unk> on a <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> it all for him .
<unk> <unk> and all of a <unk> <unk> this little <unk> of <unk> , which is in his head as the <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , and you know , and you want , you know , it 's wonderful , and the <unk> , but he doesn 't know how to <unk> .
It 's not a piece of paper , it doesn 't have a <unk> , it doesn 't have a <unk> .
So it starts to hear this sort of <unk> <unk> to grow in him , like , " I 'm going to lose , and I 'll come from this <unk> song .
I 'm not <unk> enough , and I can 't <unk> . "
And instead of going to go to the <unk> , they <unk> .
He <unk> the entire <unk> process and made something completely new .
He just <unk> the sky and said , " <unk> , don 't you see I 'm <unk> ? "
" It seems to you know , you can write a song now ?
If you really want to <unk> , you 're <unk> in a <unk> moment when I can <unk> care of you .
<unk> , <unk> to <unk> another today .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . "
And his process <unk> <unk> after this .
Not the work , the work was still <unk> as always .
But the process , and the <unk> <unk> that was <unk> when he <unk> the <unk> , the <unk> that was out of him , he was <unk> , and he was <unk> that it was not to be a <unk> thing and <unk> it was <unk> that it was not to be a <unk> and <unk> .
but I 'm going to <unk> this <unk> , wonderful <unk> <unk> a conversation between <unk> and this thing <unk> and <unk> that but it wasn 't <unk> .
So , how much much the story that I 'm going to change a little bit of the way I 'm <unk> and already <unk> me once .
This idea , I was <unk> when I was <unk> , " <unk> , <unk> , " and I 'll go into one of those <unk> <unk> in which we 're working on something , and we can 't think it 's going to be a <unk> , that 's going to be the <unk> , that 's going to be the <unk> , which is going to be the <unk> book .
Not just <unk> , just the <unk> book .
And I started thinking about <unk> this project .
But then I 'm <unk> to <unk> that I 'm going to <unk> out .
So I <unk> my face on the <unk> and I <unk> my <unk> at a <unk> corner of the room .
And I said at <unk> <unk> , " <unk> , what , both , we know that if this book is not going to be <unk> , right ?
Because as you see I 'm <unk> everything I have , I don 't have more than that .
So if you want it to be better , you have to <unk> and do your part .
Okay . But if you don 't do it , you know what , I don 't do it .
I started to write the same because it 's my work .
And I would like to be <unk> that I 'm <unk> to do my part of " Because it 's so , so OK -- <unk> does in the <unk> of Africa 's North Africa <unk> people <unk> to <unk> the <unk> of the moon , <unk> music that <unk> forward for hours and hours to <unk> .
And they were always <unk> , because the <unk> were <unk> and they were <unk> .
But every <unk> , <unk> , something <unk> , and one of these artists <unk> actually <unk> .
And I know I 'm going to know what I 'm going to talk , because I know you 've all been <unk> at some point , a <unk> like this .
It was like the time , and the <unk> <unk> through a kind of <unk> , and it wasn 't doing anything different from usually , like <unk> <unk> before , but everything was <unk> .
And suddenly , it 's not just like a human .
But they <unk> from <unk> and <unk> under the <unk> of the <unk> .
And when this <unk> , at the time , people <unk> what was , he <unk> it with her name .
<unk> your hands and <unk> <unk> , " <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , God , God , " God , " God , " God , "
That 's God , you know .
<unk> note -- when the <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> , <unk> this <unk> with them and the <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> , " <unk> , " <unk> , " <unk> , " <unk> , " <unk> , " which you can still hear in the <unk> or <unk> .
In <unk> , when a artist did something impossible and <unk> , " <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , " <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> -- a <unk> of God .
And it 's <unk> because we need it .
But , the problem comes after day , for the same <unk> , when you <unk> and <unk> that are <unk> <unk> 11 of the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> it .
It 's just a <unk> <unk> with great <unk> , and maybe never <unk> to <unk> it to <unk> that .
And maybe no one <unk> the name of God still as <unk> , and so what 's going to do with the rest of his life ?
It 's hard .
This is one of the most <unk> <unk> to do in a <unk> life .
But maybe it 's not to be so <unk> if you 're <unk> to not believe , <unk> , that the most <unk> of your being come from you .
But <unk> just that <unk> you are <unk> data in <unk> from a source of this <unk> part of your life that you then have to <unk> .
And , you know , if we think it all changes .
And so I started <unk> , and it 's certainly like I <unk> it for several months during the <unk> of the book that I was <unk> early , <unk> , <unk> of my <unk> .
And what I have to continue to <unk> when I feel <unk> from this is , I don 't fear .
Don 't <unk> . <unk> just your work .
<unk> to <unk> for your hand , any one can be .
If your work is <unk> , <unk> .
If the <unk> , you 'll <unk> <unk> to you <unk> <unk> <unk> some kind of <unk> , for one moment through your <unk> , then , " <unk> ! "
<unk> , you do the same your <unk> .
And " <unk> ! " <unk> ! " <unk> .
I think and I think it 's <unk> .
" <unk> ! " <unk> ! " <unk> , " <unk> " <unk> " <unk> " <unk> " <unk> " . "
Thank you .
Thank you .
<unk> <unk> : <unk> !
As you know , I talked about some of these projects on the human genome , what it can <unk> and discovery new <unk> of genes .
Now we 're <unk> a new path . We started <unk> the biology and now starting from that digital code , we 're <unk> into a new <unk> of biology , <unk> and <unk> life .
We always have tried to ask a big question .
" <unk> is life ? " It 's something that many <unk> I think they have <unk> to understand at different levels .
We tried different <unk> , <unk> to the <unk> terms .
We 're <unk> for about 20 years now .
When we <unk> the human genome <unk> to go from the world of biology in the digital world .
Now we <unk> us : can we <unk> the life , or create new life from this digital universe ?
This is the map of a small <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , which is the species from the <unk> genome between those that can <unk> into the lab .
And we tried to reduce <unk> the genome to <unk> one even smaller .
We can <unk> a <unk> of the genes about 500 that are here .
But when we take a look at its map , it 's <unk> simple than our .
<unk> , that 's simple .
But when we look at all the genes that we can <unk> , one at the time , is very <unk> that this can bring a <unk> cell .
So I thought the only way to <unk> was <unk> this <unk> so that we <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to <unk> some of these questions .
So we started the <unk> of " can we <unk> a <unk> ? "
Can the chemistry <unk> to produce these big molecules that we 've never been able to create before ?
And , in <unk> case , can we make a <unk> ?
A <unk> is just a piece of <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> with which we 're able to <unk> life is <unk> <unk> .
Our ability to write the code , instead of <unk> rather slowly , but it 's <unk> .
And our most <unk> results <unk> the <unk> <unk> .
We <unk> over 15 years ago .
The process has <unk> many <unk> , <unk> with a <unk> <unk> before <unk> experiments .
But we found that DNA <unk> is very difficult .
There are <unk> of thousands of cars in the world that <unk> small <unk> of DNA , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , and it 's a <unk> process : <unk> is <unk> long , <unk> there are .
So we had to develop a new way to <unk> these <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
And this was our first <unk> , <unk> from digital information of <unk> genome <unk> .
It 's a small virus that <unk> bacteria .
We designed <unk> <unk> , <unk> the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> a DNA <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
The interesting part is when we took this piece of <unk> <unk> <unk> and we <unk> it in the bacteria , and we <unk> it in the bacteria , the bacteria have <unk> to read this code , and <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> are <unk> by the cells , they <unk> back and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
I talked about recently with members of the <unk> <unk> <unk> that they <unk> this model .
They <unk> more than you .
<unk> that 's a situation where software can actually build its own <unk> in a <unk> system .
But we could do the largest things .
We wanted to build the entire <unk> of <unk> .
They 're more than <unk> <unk> code .
So we thought we 're going to <unk> in the size of the virus , so that we can change the <unk> to understand what the <unk> are .
<unk> is <unk> , and if we <unk> with information <unk> in a computer , these must be very <unk> .
When we <unk> this genome for the first time in <unk> , the <unk> <unk> was a <unk> for every 10 <unk> <unk> .
We found out , <unk> , 30 <unk> . If we were <unk> that original sequence never <unk> , we could never be able to do it work .
A part of the process is to design <unk> 50 <unk> that <unk> with all the other <unk> <unk> of 50 <unk> to build <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to build smaller <unk> that <unk> together .
We 're going to be <unk> here .
You probably read that that <unk> us of the <unk> .
So , we have a <unk> code <unk> on four <unk> : A , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> of those <unk> <unk> together about 20 <unk> , and there 's a <unk> order of <unk> for every <unk> .
So we can use the code to write words , <unk> , <unk> .
What we did at the beginning was <unk> .
Some of them were <unk> by the fact that it wasn 't <unk> .
We designed these <unk> to just <unk> with <unk> .
There are <unk> that <unk> them and <unk> <unk> them .
And we started <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
But every step we 've made these <unk> in <unk> so that we <unk> <unk> that we 're <unk> to create a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , which we 're going to create a minute .
We 're trying to <unk> the process .
So this seems to be the <unk> of a <unk> <unk> .
When you start these <unk> <unk> <unk> , over 100 <unk> <unk> , you don 't get to <unk> directly in the <unk> <unk> .
You get to the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> biology .
So we 've <unk> other <unk> .
<unk> of another <unk> called <unk> <unk> <unk> , which in biology <unk> to <unk> DNA <unk> .
Here 's one example .
This <unk> <unk> , which can <unk> three million <unk> <unk> .
You can see in the <unk> <unk> as his <unk> is <unk> .
<unk> 12 hours , it 's <unk> exactly how it was before .
<unk> thousands of organisms that are able to do that .
These organisms can be completely <unk> .
We 're going to have to live under <unk> .
I 'm absolutely sure life <unk> in space , and they <unk> to find new <unk> <unk> of water .
<unk> , actually , NASA 's shown that this happens .
This is a picture of the <unk> that we 've built these <unk> , just using these <unk> , just using the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> them .
This image was not <unk> with a <unk> <unk> , but with a <unk> <unk> .
It 's a <unk> so big that we can <unk> with a <unk> <unk> .
These are pictures that <unk> a <unk> period of about six seconds .
This is the <unk> we 've done a little bit of time ago .
They 're more than <unk> code .
It 's the largest <unk> of a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
It 's got <unk> <unk> <unk> to 300 million .
If you <unk> it with a <unk> 10 <unk> without spaces , we 'll just <unk> pages to <unk> this code .
Now , how do we do it ? How can we <unk> it ?
<unk> , with a <unk> <unk> is a <unk> game .
It 's a little bit more <unk> when you use of the bacteria .
It 's <unk> even when it 's about <unk> cells like our : you just <unk> the <unk> and <unk> another , which is basically the <unk> process .
In <unk> <unk> , the <unk> is <unk> in the cell , but we <unk> <unk> that we 're able to do a <unk> <unk> of a cell to another and <unk> .
We <unk> a <unk> <unk> from a kind of <unk> .
<unk> are different than men from <unk> .
We <unk> some <unk> <unk> in a way that we can decide what to choose to do for this <unk> .
And then he <unk> with the <unk> so that we <unk> all the <unk> .
And when we put it in the cell <unk> , and we <unk> our <unk> <unk> the new <unk> , <unk> went into the cell .
And we <unk> <unk> that we don 't have to go beyond , but we tried to <unk> over there .
This is one of the largest <unk> <unk> .
We found that <unk> species have <unk> a second or a third <unk> <unk> somewhere , <unk> in a second thousand new <unk> to that species .
So who think about evolution as a <unk> <unk> at the time you <unk> doesn 't understand much of biology .
We <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> that was in the cell didn 't <unk> one .
The <unk> <unk> we have <unk> it .
It 's <unk> , and he <unk> the other <unk> as <unk> material , <unk> it , and we <unk> it with just the cell and the new <unk> .
It became blue because of the genes we <unk> .
And in a short <unk> of time , all the <unk> of a species are <unk> , and it 's <unk> of all in a new <unk> , <unk> on the new software that we <unk> in the cell .
All the <unk> are <unk> , the <unk> are <unk> , and when you <unk> the code <unk> <unk> exactly to what we 've <unk> .
Now , this could be <unk> <unk> , but we <unk> the software DNA can change things so <unk> enough .
Now , I 've already <unk> that 's not about <unk> -- but <unk> <unk> from <unk> -- but <unk> <unk> from three million years and a half of evolution , and I said that maybe we 're going to create a new version of the <unk> <unk> that we <unk> new <unk> species on this <unk> .
Why do that ?
I think it 's pretty <unk> when we think about our <unk> .
We 're going to go from six and a half billion people in the next 40 years .
Right to give one example : I was born in <unk> .
Now there are three people on the planet to <unk> in <unk> ; in 40 years , there 's going to be four .
We 're <unk> problems now with food and <unk> water , <unk> and <unk> , <unk> for six billion and a half billion people .
We 're going to get it for nine billion .
<unk> more than five billion <unk> , over 30 billion <unk> <unk> .
That means 100 million <unk> a day .
When we try to find <unk> <unk> , or any kind of process to <unk> , it will be a huge challenge .
<unk> we have to realize all the carbon <unk> from these materials that <unk> in the atmosphere .
At the day , today , because of the <unk> <unk> around the world , we have a <unk> with about 20 million genes , and I like to think that are the <unk> <unk> for the future .
The <unk> industry is just a <unk> about <unk> , and think about how many different things are <unk> out .
Our <unk> data from the <unk> reality , and our imagination .
Now we have <unk> , because of these <unk> <unk> <unk> , able to create what we call <unk> <unk> <unk> .
We can make a big robot that can produce a million <unk> a day .
Think of <unk> these 20 million genes or try to try to <unk> the <unk> to produce <unk> or <unk> , new <unk> , we can change , through a small team , and make more biology now that in the last 20 years of science .
And it 's just a standard <unk> .
We can choose to <unk> <unk> , chemistry or <unk> , <unk> <unk> , production of <unk> <unk> .
This is a <unk> of some software <unk> that we 're working on to be able to <unk> and design species at the computer .
Well , we don 't know how they will be .
We know exactly what their code is .
Now we 're <unk> on the <unk> <unk> generation .
You 've seen you who <unk> <unk> from <unk> was an experiment .
We <unk> second and third generation that <unk> enough to <unk> soon from <unk> to <unk> <unk> , <unk> value like <unk> or different kinds of <unk> .
But the only way that biology can have a big impact without <unk> <unk> the cost of food and <unk> the <unk> would be <unk> the CO2 in the <unk> , so we 're working for cells that we 're working on to design that can achieve that purpose , and we think we can have the first <unk> of <unk> generation in about 18 months .
<unk> <unk> with CO2 is a <unk> but in our <unk> <unk> , but in our <unk> <unk> around the world , we found different <unk> .
This is a <unk> that we <unk> in <unk> .
It <unk> in the deep ocean , at about <unk> feet down to the temperature of <unk> .
We <unk> <unk> from CO2 using hydrogen <unk> as hydrogen <unk> .
We 're trying to understand whether we can <unk> CO2 , which can be easily <unk> , <unk> that CO2 in <unk> , to drive this process .
So , we think we can think we could <unk> what the basic question of " which is what the basic question is , we <unk> the <unk> goal to <unk> the entire industry .
<unk> . If you can 't do this from TED , where can you ?
It 's going to <unk> a main source of energy .
And we 're working on to use the same <unk> to create <unk> <unk> .
You saw this year with the flu , we 're always <unk> back a year and with a dollar in less when it 's about finding the right .
I think that 's going to be <unk> <unk> in <unk> .
So , that 's how the future could start to look <unk> , now , the evolution <unk> with bacteria , <unk> , <unk> evolution with <unk> , and finally <unk> cells .
We are <unk> so much from <unk> people .
Our goal is to make a way of living enough to try to <unk> it . Thank you very much . Thank you very much .
First of all , I 'm going to show you , the <unk> possible , some <unk> work , some <unk> work , which is <unk> to a <unk> <unk> .
It 's a environment that you can <unk> is at the local level that <unk> with a huge amount of data .
Here we 're seeing <unk> <unk> of <unk> with a kind of <unk> <unk> and <unk> , for a fast <unk> , <unk> <unk> the images like we want .
And no matter how big the amount of information that we see , how big are these <unk> of data or data .
Most of them are <unk> <unk> , but this for example is a <unk> <unk> from the <unk> of <unk> , and <unk> in the <unk> of 300 <unk> .
It doesn 't make any difference because the only thing that <unk> the <unk> of a system like this is the number of <unk> on your screen at any moment . It 's also a very <unk> architecture .
This is a whole book , example of data , not images .
This is <unk> <unk> <unk> . Every <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And to <unk> that it 's just about <unk> and not images , we can do something like that , to actually see that it 's a real <unk> <unk> of the text , not a picture .
It could be a way to read a little bit of <unk> to read a book .
I don 't <unk> it .
This is an <unk> example . This is a <unk> number of <unk> .
Every big image is the beginning of a <unk> .
And it really gives you the pleasure of reading the real version of a <unk> or a <unk> , which is for nature a <unk> <unk> , which is for nature a <unk> kind of a half .
We also did something with the corner of this , in particular number of <unk> .
We created a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> much higher than what you use in a normal <unk> , and we <unk> you <unk> <unk> of the <unk> content .
If you want to see the <unk> of this <unk> , you can see here .
Or others models , or even <unk> <unk> .
And this really <unk> some of these ideas to <unk> the <unk> of space on the screen .
I think this <unk> to put the <unk> <unk> and other <unk> <unk> , not to be <unk> .
Of course , the <unk> is one of the most <unk> <unk> for this kind of technology .
And on this one , I don 't want to lose time , if we don 't say we have <unk> <unk> to <unk> in this field .
These are all the streets in the United States <unk> over a <unk> image of NASA .
So now , I 'm going to try to do it .
This is actually actually in the Web ; you can see it .
It 's a project called <unk> , which <unk> two different technologies .
One is <unk> and the other is a <unk> research that 's very interesting <unk> <unk> <unk> , a <unk> student of Washington , with the help of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . <unk> . <unk> <unk> .
And it 's alive on the Web , <unk> by <unk> .
You can <unk> when we do this kind of <unk> , where we can go from an image to the other and have this kind of experience <unk> <unk> .
But the <unk> <unk> of the images here actually has a meaning .
So , the <unk> of <unk> <unk> have <unk> these images together , so that <unk> to <unk> places that <unk> <unk> all <unk> near the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and these things are all <unk> at the <unk> level .
I don 't know if I have time to show you some other environment .
There are some much <unk> .
I want to spend directly one of the <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> data and this <unk> <unk> from a <unk> <unk> <unk> that we 've done for the first time , to show you what <unk> is really the key behind this technology , the technology , the <unk> technology , <unk> . And it 's not <unk> as <unk> as we put in the website .
We had to <unk> <unk> <unk> and so on .
This is a <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> and <unk> images of kinds of <unk> in <unk> , other <unk> and so on . <unk> of these <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
So , they 're all <unk> images from <unk> and they were all <unk> at the <unk> level in this way .
And it 's possible to <unk> this <unk> way .
You know , I would never have thought of work to work for <unk> .
It 's very <unk> <unk> <unk> this kind of <unk> here .
I think I 'm going to see that 's a lot of different kinds of <unk> : from the cell phones <unk> <unk> , a <unk> number , <unk> , a <unk> number , <unk> in this environment .
And if I can , I can <unk> to look for the <unk> .
Many are <unk> by <unk> , and so so much .
<unk> there 's a series of photographs -- <unk> .
This is a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
We can go from the <unk> to the physics of this environment .
The <unk> point is that we can do things with social environment . This is <unk> data from the entire memory of the <unk> of the Earth , from the <unk> of <unk> <unk> , from the point of view and <unk> all that data together .
All those pictures become <unk> together , more than the <unk> parts .
You have a model of the entire <unk> that <unk> .
Think about this as the <unk> of the work of <unk> <unk> on Earth .
It 's something that <unk> in <unk> <unk> as people , and the <unk> that we <unk> it , and the <unk> for the use .
Their pictures are <unk> with <unk> <unk> from other people .
If someone is the idea of <unk> all these <unk> <unk> the name , my picture of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> all of the data , and I can use it as a <unk> <unk> to <unk> in that space , in that <unk> , in that <unk> , using the pictures of anyone , and have a social experience <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
Of course , a <unk> of this is <unk> <unk> <unk> of every interesting part of the land , <unk> not just from <unk> <unk> and <unk> , but from <unk> memory .
<unk> <unk> .
Chris Anderson : I understand ? What your software is <unk> us to do is that , in the next few years , all the photographs that 's <unk> to anyone in the world 's <unk> <unk> together ?
<unk> : Yeah . What 's doing in <unk> is <unk> .
It 's <unk> <unk> , if you want , between images .
And he 's <unk> it at the content of the <unk> .
The thing becomes very interesting if you think about the <unk> of information <unk> that many of these <unk> .
As when you do a <unk> research images on the web , you <unk> a <unk> and the text on the page has a lot information about the images of the picture .
Now , what happens if that picture is <unk> to all your picture ?
So the amount of <unk> <unk> and the amount of <unk> that <unk> is really huge . It 's a <unk> effect . It 's a <unk> effect .
CA : <unk> , it 's really amazing . <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> you very much .
One of the main <unk> when you <unk> and one of the <unk> research is that we can live between who has not <unk> the <unk> <unk> , <unk> the past the wind , the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
You think that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , or that <unk> <unk> <unk> are still <unk> <unk> <unk> , or that <unk> <unk> are still <unk> <unk> <unk> , or <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> of <unk> , to <unk> the <unk> of <unk> , and that the idea that the world in which we live in in which , but it 's just a <unk> of reality , but it 's just a <unk> of reality ,
the <unk> of a particular <unk> of <unk> choices that our <unk> has done , well or bad , many <unk> .
And of course , of course , all <unk> <unk> .
Everybody <unk> . Everybody <unk> .
We 're <unk> to <unk> <unk> .
We have to deal with the death <unk> , so we don 't know if we were <unk> and <unk> --
We all have an art .
What <unk> is the <unk> of the song , the <unk> of every culture 's song ,
<unk> 't matter that matter <unk> <unk> <unk> , or the <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> , or the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , or the <unk> <unk> <unk> , or a <unk> in the heart of <unk> .
He was my <unk> of journey in <unk> a month ago , or a <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> mother 's <unk> .
All of these <unk> us that there are other ways of <unk> other ways of thinking , other ways to move around the world .
And if you look at a moment , it 's a concept that can give you hope .
<unk> , the <unk> of the world create a <unk> of life <unk> and <unk> that <unk> the planet , and it 's important for the <unk> of the planet as the <unk> <unk> note as the <unk> <unk> .
And you can think of this <unk> <unk> as a <unk> and you can <unk> the <unk> of all the <unk> , dreams , dreams , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> to be <unk> from human imagination of <unk> .
<unk> is the fantastic <unk> of humanity .
It 's the <unk> of what we are and what we can be as as as <unk> as <unk> .
And <unk> <unk> was <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> has been <unk> at <unk> and <unk> much <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , for example , <unk> that 50 percent of all the species was or is on the <unk> of the <unk> , just because it 's <unk> , or -- in the <unk> <unk> -- in the <unk> <unk> -- and you don 't even even know that 's <unk> diversity .
The <unk> of all that is , of course , the <unk> <unk> .
When you 're <unk> <unk> <unk> on this planet .
A language is not just a <unk> or a <unk> of <unk> rules .
A language is the <unk> of the human spirit .
It 's the medium with which the <unk> of every culture comes in the world .
Every language is a forest of the mind , a <unk> , a thought , a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And of those <unk> <unk> , as we 're sitting here at <unk> , at least half is not <unk> in the <unk> of the children .
They 're not going to get to children , which means , unless you know , that 's not going to be <unk> .
What 's more <unk> of being <unk> by the <unk> , the last last to speak a language , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> or <unk> <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> or <unk> <unk> ?
This <unk> <unk> <unk> was the state of someone in the world every two weeks , every two two weeks , a <unk> <unk> and door with it in the <unk> <unk> the <unk> of a <unk> language .
And I know somebody of you know , " <unk> 't it better .
The world doesn 't be a better place if we all know the same language ? " <unk> , so we all <unk> . <unk> .
<unk> <unk> .
We 're going to <unk> what it means you can 't talk about their own language .
Today I 'd like to give you a journey through the <unk> --
a small journey in the <unk> to give you a <unk> of what we 're <unk> .
Many of us <unk> that when I say " different ways of <unk> " I mean , " I mean different ways of <unk> .
<unk> for example , this <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , the <unk> of <unk> , which <unk> <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
It 's a <unk> that 's not able to <unk> the blue color from the green because the <unk> is <unk> in the <unk> , from which <unk> the <unk> .
They have a <unk> language and a <unk> rule , <unk> <unk> , " <unk> <unk> " : you have to <unk> a person talking a different language .
And all that <unk> in the past <unk> , but the <unk> is that in these families <unk> in which they talk to six or seven <unk> because of the <unk> <unk> <unk> nobody <unk> .
You can start to listen and then I started talking about .
<unk> one of the most interesting <unk> that I lived , the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , an incredible <unk> that had the first <unk> in <unk> .
In <unk> , five <unk> <unk> have <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
They <unk> <unk> from the top photographs that <unk> them in <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> that this <unk> of the <unk> forest had never seen anything .
They <unk> the <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> to <unk> a form or a <unk> , and not <unk> nothing , they <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> , and they <unk> the five <unk> with <unk> .
But <unk> not just <unk> the <unk> .
They <unk> their <unk> .
<unk> percent <unk> <unk> was <unk> by their own .
We <unk> to eight <unk> and we found two <unk> of death and we found two natural <unk> , and when we <unk> to know , they <unk> that one of them was so that he died , and then they <unk> it . <unk> it , every way , they had a <unk> <unk> .
<unk> were able to recognize the animal from 40 <unk> and <unk> the species .
<unk> <unk> , I was <unk> a really interesting job when my <unk> <unk> <unk> me , if I wanted to go to <unk> between <unk> society , <unk> to the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
To give a sense of <unk> , I should have understand <unk> culture , and that <unk> is not <unk> .
It 's pretty much about a <unk> <unk> view of the world .
Very interesting .
If you ask you to <unk> the big <unk> of the world , what do you do ?
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , etc . .
A continent has always left out , thinking , <unk> <unk> , not <unk> <unk> . And instead and yes and <unk> is not the <unk> of these <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
What makes the <unk> is the <unk> relationship between life and death .
So <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> can be <unk> by the <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> , and <unk> <unk> to the <unk> <unk> .
So , this is the <unk> <unk> to say , " <unk> <unk> , " <unk> <unk> .
We <unk> in <unk> and <unk> God . "
And from the moment that you 're <unk> , is the spirit that <unk> you , how can you get it wrong ?
So , they <unk> to these incredible events : <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a rather <unk> of the power of mind in the body when it 's <unk> in a state of <unk> <unk> .
<unk> all the <unk> that I lived with the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , in the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> of <unk> civilization <unk> that once <unk> on the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> on the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
In a <unk> continent , this <unk> has never been <unk> by <unk> .
<unk> <unk> today are <unk> by a <unk> , but their education is extraordinary <unk> .
<unk> <unk> are <unk> by <unk> to <unk> <unk> from <unk> to <unk> , and they live in a world <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> <unk> for 18 years .
Two <unk> <unk> years <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> , the nine months of <unk> that <unk> in the <unk> of the mother , now are <unk> in the <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
For that time , they 're <unk> to the values of their society , values that <unk> their <unk> and just their <unk> <unk> <unk> -- or to say <unk> <unk> .
At the <unk> of this incredible <unk> , they 're <unk> <unk> out and for the first time in their life , at the age of <unk> , see a <unk> . And in that moment of the first <unk> , when the sun <unk> <unk> <unk> , everything they have been <unk> in <unk> , all that they have been <unk> in the <unk> . <unk> <unk> does a <unk> , and <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> , and he says ,
" <unk> ? <unk> how I said I said .
It 's <unk> . Now it 's <unk> . "
They call <unk> <unk> and they say that we , <unk> <unk> , we are the <unk> of the world 's <unk> .
This level of <unk> is extremely important .
When we think about the <unk> <unk> and the <unk> <unk> <unk> and the old story of <unk> <unk> , which is a <unk> concept in its <unk> or maybe <unk> <unk> and say that these <unk> are closer to the Earth than us .
<unk> <unk> are not <unk> or <unk> <unk> by <unk> .
There 's no space for these things in the <unk> <unk> of <unk> or in the <unk> <unk> <unk> , but because of time and <unk> , they created a <unk> of the Earth <unk> not on the concept of <unk> <unk> , but on a <unk> <unk> <unk> -- the concept that the Earth can live only because it 's <unk> by human consciousness .
What does it mean ?
It means that a <unk> of the <unk> that <unk> <unk> that the mountain is a <unk> spirit that <unk> its <unk> will be a human being <unk> different and will have a <unk> <unk> with the mountain or that place , in a <unk> <unk> of <unk> that <unk> a mountain <unk> , <unk> that <unk> is a <unk> <unk> to <unk> .
which is the <unk> of one spirit or a <unk> <unk> is <unk> .
What 's interesting is the <unk> that <unk> the relationship between <unk> and the natural world .
I grew up in the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> to be <unk> .
That made me a human being different from my friends who believe that <unk> are the <unk> of <unk> and the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and the <unk> <unk> <unk> that live in the <unk> world , <unk> that live in the world 's <unk> , <unk> that live in the world , <unk> , <unk> that <unk> in the <unk> <unk> .
If you start <unk> that these <unk> can actually create different , different <unk> , we can start to understand some of them .
I <unk> this picture at <unk> in <unk> <unk> .
Maybe some of you 've heard about <unk> , the most powerful <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> .
What makes the <unk> is not the potential <unk> of the <unk> , but his <unk> . It 's <unk> by two elements .
On one hand , this <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> a series of <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
<unk> the only <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> a little bit of the <unk> , but it 's <unk> with the <unk> of a <unk> <unk> 's family <unk> <unk> said <unk> .
This <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , very similar to the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
If you ever see the <unk> <unk> on the <unk> <unk> , which is <unk> by a different <unk> of species , it <unk> it .
<unk> that <unk> on the <unk> is a little bit like to be <unk> by a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> on a sea of electricity . <unk> 't create a <unk> of the reality of the <unk> ; it makes the <unk> of reality .
<unk> often with my <unk> , Richard <unk> <unk> , the man who <unk> was <unk> , with his discovery of <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> my <unk> , you can 't <unk> these <unk> as <unk> because if you 're <unk> , you can 't tell any of being <unk> . <unk> <unk> can 't be <unk> because they 're <unk> by a <unk> that 's <unk> in the <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
It 's possible to <unk> <unk> <unk> , if you could <unk> with other <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> .
Now , the <unk> is the <unk> that are <unk> in this <unk> are <unk> <unk> , the same necessary to <unk> the <unk> . The question <unk> <unk> : in a <unk> of <unk> species of plants , how do these <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , not like that , but that if you look at the <unk> of the <unk> ?
We use the big <unk> of <unk> and <unk> , which can <unk> .
But if you look at the <unk> , we 'll be <unk> . "
What does it mean ?
This <unk> , <unk> <unk> , who <unk> <unk> <unk> in the forest , and that our eyes <unk> in the forest , and our eyes <unk> in the same species .
If the <unk> <unk> like <unk> <unk> us , " <unk> " <unk> " <unk> " <unk> " <unk> " <unk> " <unk> " <unk> " <unk> " <unk> " No . "
The solution is , you take the <unk> <unk> in a night moon , <unk> <unk> with a different <unk> .
And with that you don 't <unk> , but it 's much more interesting than <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Now , [ <unk> ] the problem is that even the ones of us who have <unk> <unk> <unk> them , but in some way we <unk> to the <unk> of history than our real world , and <unk> .
In fact , the <unk> century , in 300 years , not <unk> <unk> for its <unk> or his <unk> <unk> <unk> , but rather like the <unk> was where we <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> the mass of diversity of <unk> and <unk> <unk> the mass of diversity and <unk> on the planet . Now , the problem is not change .
All the <unk> through the <unk> have been <unk> in a <unk> for new <unk> <unk> .
And the problem is not technology .
<unk> <unk> have no <unk> to be <unk> when they put <unk> and <unk> as the <unk> <unk> , they didn 't <unk> to be <unk> when they put <unk> and <unk> .
It 's not the change or technology that <unk> the <unk> of <unk> . It 's the power .
The <unk> <unk> of <unk> .
And if you look at the world , you 'll see that these are not <unk> <unk> to <unk> .
They are <unk> creatures and <unk> <unk> out of existence by <unk> forces that go beyond their <unk> of <unk> .
<unk> that <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk> --
a <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , a <unk> that has lived in the forest to a generation ago , and now <unk> to the <unk> and <unk> on the <unk> <unk> , where you can see the <unk> <unk> <unk> from the <unk> that seems to <unk> away from the <unk> <unk> , where the <unk> <unk> <unk> , where the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , where the <unk> <unk> <unk> ,
<unk> <unk> the <unk> with the <unk> <unk> to the forest .
Or , in the case of <unk> , are the diseases that are <unk> with the <unk> discovery of <unk> .
If we <unk> on the <unk> of the <unk> , where I 'm doing a lot of research , you 'll see the <unk> <unk> of the political <unk> .
As <unk> <unk> , <unk> physics of a <unk> , is <unk> at the <unk> level , but <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> , not just <unk> , but <unk> <unk> in certain <unk> , because it 's part of the development .
And you can 't understand the <unk> of the <unk> until you get away from the beginning .
I <unk> the <unk> miles from <unk> in the <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> with a young <unk> , but only <unk> <unk> to <unk> with a young <unk> , but <unk> <unk> <unk> that I 've got to <unk> what 's behind .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> million people <unk> from the <unk> during the <unk> <unk> .
The father of this guy was <unk> at <unk> <unk> .
which means that it was <unk> at the time of Chinese <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> with <unk> <unk> during the <unk> that brought the <unk> in <unk> .
My mother was <unk> and his <unk> was <unk> .
It was taken <unk> to <unk> at the age of two years <unk> under his <unk> because he couldn 't have no <unk> .
<unk> , who did the same , was <unk> in <unk> <unk> .
One day he <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> and , for this <unk> , was <unk> to <unk> jobs for seven years .
The pain of <unk> can be <unk> , but the spirit of the <unk> of <unk> is from present .
<unk> , all <unk> to a choice .
Do you want to live in the world 's <unk> or we want to <unk> the world of diversity ?
The great <unk> <unk> <unk> , before she died said that his greatest fear was that , in our <unk> to go to this <unk> <unk> vision of the world , not just <unk> the entire <unk> of human imagination to a <unk> <unk> of human imagination , but a day it was <unk> us from a <unk> <unk> <unk> that there were other possibilities .
And it 's <unk> to remember that our species is <unk> for <unk> years .
<unk> <unk> , who gave us <unk> , which <unk> us <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> , <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> with the <unk> of <unk> , by <unk> <unk> , creating the <unk> of <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> years ago .
The <unk> world has <unk> at <unk> 300 years .
That <unk> story , I 'm not <unk> that we have the answers to all the challenges that we can <unk> in <unk> to come .
When these <unk> <unk> <unk> of the world is asked what it means to be human , <unk> with <unk> different <unk> .
And it 's in these answers that we all <unk> the chance of being what we are , a kind of <unk> , which has to <unk> that all the <unk> and all the <unk> can <unk> . And there are big <unk> <unk> .
I <unk> this picture on the <unk> <unk> of <unk> , when I went to <unk> <unk> with <unk> , and this man , <unk> me , <unk> me the wonderful story of her <unk> .
The <unk> government <unk> was not always <unk> with the <unk> <unk> and in the <unk> for 50 to <unk> our <unk> , we <unk> them in <unk> .
The <unk> of this man <unk> <unk> .
<unk> , family , <unk> for his life , <unk> <unk> the <unk> , and all of his <unk> .
You want to know that <unk> don 't <unk> the cold , <unk> it .
<unk> <unk> <unk> were made of <unk> fish <unk> in <unk> .
The <unk> of this man didn 't <unk> <unk> by night or <unk> <unk> .
It 's <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> in your hand . When I did it <unk> it , he <unk> it into a <unk> .
He <unk> <unk> on the <unk> of this <unk> <unk> and when <unk> <unk> <unk> , he <unk> a dog .
He <unk> the dog and created a <unk> , with the <unk> <unk> created a <unk> , he <unk> a <unk> , he <unk> on the <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
<unk> to talk about <unk> ? [ <unk> ] And that , in different ways , [ <unk> ] is the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> and all the <unk> <unk> of the world .
<unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> government <unk> <unk> to <unk> the total <unk> area of an area of bigger area of California and <unk> <unk> .
It 's their new <unk> . It 's called <unk> .
It 's a <unk> <unk> . It 's <unk> all the <unk> resources .
One <unk> example of how a <unk> can <unk> with his <unk> .
And , finally , I think it 's pretty <unk> at least who we have been in these <unk> <unk> areas of the planet , realize that they 're not <unk> at all .
For someone 's home .
<unk> <unk> of the human imagination that <unk> to <unk> . And for us all the dreams of these children , like our children 's dreams , become part of the <unk> of hope .
<unk> , we <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , we 're <unk> that <unk> never <unk> .
<unk> that <unk> --
<unk> <unk> are not <unk> , but we believe that stories can change the world , and maybe we 're the best <unk> to tell the stories of the world . Every month our <unk> <unk> <unk> million <unk> .
<unk> <unk> our <unk> .
Our <unk> are <unk> by millions of people .
Our work is <unk> in the <unk> to bring our public in places to <unk> <unk> from which <unk> <unk> from which they <unk> from how they saw and , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , the world of <unk> in diversity , and we have to find a <unk> in a world <unk> and <unk> .
where the <unk> of all the <unk> can <unk> to our <unk> <unk> .
Thank you .
I 'm going to talk about some of the things I 've been doing in this book that I hope you 've already heard and <unk> <unk> some <unk> , in the case you don 't know .
I 'd like to start with what I call the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> ?
The <unk> <unk> of all society <unk> <unk> . The <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> : " If we want to <unk> the <unk> of our citizens , " The way to do it is <unk> freedom <unk> . "
The reason is , on one hand , in fact that freedom is in itself a value , is <unk> , <unk> , useful for human beings .
<unk> else is in fact that if we 're <unk> , each of us can act to do everything that we <unk> our <unk> , without any one <unk> in our name .
The way to <unk> the freedom is to <unk> choice .
More choices people have , more <unk> , and more <unk> is their freedom , and more is their freedom , and more is their <unk> .
This , <unk> , it 's so <unk> <unk> in society that no one <unk> <unk> in <unk> .
And it 's also <unk> <unk> in our lives .
I 'm going to show you some examples of what progress has made it possible .
This is my <unk> . It 's not particularly big .
I 'm going to give me a simple note on the <unk> to <unk> .
In my <unk> , there are <unk> <unk> <unk> , without <unk> the <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> and 12 <unk> <unk> <unk> that you can buy for you a huge number of <unk> in the <unk> <unk> that no one of the <unk> <unk> is <unk> of your <unk> .
That 's what the <unk> is .
And then you go to the <unk> <unk> <unk> to buy a <unk> : <unk> , <unk> , radio , <unk> , <unk> .
And in this single <unk> store , there 's a big number of <unk> <unk> .
We can make six million different <unk> <unk> using the <unk> that there are in one just store .
<unk> <unk> that there is <unk> choice .
<unk> <unk> : the world of <unk> .
Once , when I was a kid , you could get all the services <unk> <unk> , <unk> that they were <unk> by <unk> <unk> .
They <unk> the phone , not <unk> it .
<unk> of that , between the other , was that the phone <unk> never <unk> .
These days they went .
We have a <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> , especially between the cell phones .
That 's the cell phones .
My <unk> is in the middle , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , and <unk> for <unk> <unk> .
If you don 't have seen in the store under the house , you 're <unk> that soon soon <unk> .
And what 's the end of the end is that people <unk> in the <unk> and does this question . And you know , that 's the answer is " No . "
It 's not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn 't <unk> .
So , in other <unk> of life that are much more important than <unk> , <unk> the same <unk> of choices .
<unk> <unk> : <unk> , no longer happens in the United States you 're <unk> from <unk> and the <unk> <unk> you have what to do .
Instead , <unk> from the <unk> , and the <unk> says , " OK , could we do it . And or <unk> , or <unk> , " he 's <unk> these <unk> and <unk> <unk> . And these <unk> , and <unk> <unk> . What do you want to do ? "
You asked him , " <unk> , what do you do ? "
And the <unk> says , " <unk> has these <unk> and <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> these <unk> and <unk> . "
" What do you want to do ? "
And you say , " <unk> if she was me , what would you like ? "
And the <unk> , " But I 'm not her . "
The result we call it the <unk> <unk> , which makes it look like a good thing .
But actually , it 's not a <unk> the weight and responsibility to make decisions from someone who knows something , <unk> the <unk> , to <unk> , to <unk> something that doesn 't know -- and almost of course , is <unk> -- and so , you know , you know , if you can 't <unk> to make decisions that patient is .
There 's a huge <unk> of <unk> products , <unk> to people like me and you , that if you think about it has no sense , because we can 't <unk> .
But if we can 't <unk> it , why do we <unk> them ?
The answer is they want to <unk> that we call the <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> to <unk> that , as our <unk> is our <unk> now is a question , as you see in this <unk> . " We don 't want to <unk> children . <unk> their sex at the right time . " We don 't know the <unk> : we have to <unk> it .
And we can <unk> how many times we <unk> us .
which means that every <unk> , <unk> to <unk> , you have to decide that kind of person ,
<unk> to the family and <unk> , a <unk> time perspective , <unk> almost for anyone , was that there was <unk> the <unk> as soon as possible , and you can get <unk> children .
The only real choice was with who , not when , and they don 't even what to do later .
<unk> , all of that is really to play .
They <unk> to <unk> very smart students , and they <unk> their 20 percent <unk> work than a time .
And not because they 're <unk> , not because they 're <unk> .
but why are I <unk> , <unk> <unk> , " <unk> <unk> or not ? "
" <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> ? I have to think about children or to the career or to the career ? "
They 're <unk> <unk> .
And they try to answer these questions , even if this <unk> , you don 't know the <unk> that <unk> and not to get a good <unk> to my <unk> .
And they really have to do that . They are important questions .
Now , the work : we 're <unk> , as <unk> <unk> , because technology <unk> us work every day , from every day , from every day on the planet , <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , there 's a <unk> , and I 'm not going to say anybody , where the <unk> works .
I don 't tell you , because I want to use it .
What it means , this incredible freedom of choice that we have about the work ? It 's we have to decide , <unk> at all moment , if we have to work or not .
We can go to see our son to play <unk> , with the cell phone in a <unk> , the <unk> in the other , and the <unk> , <unk> , on the <unk> .
And even if I 'm all <unk> , every minute we see our son , we 're also <unk> , " I need to answer this call ? "
" I have to answer this <unk> ? I have to <unk> this letter ? "
And even when the answer is " no , that makes the experience of your son very different from what it would be in other conditions .
So , from any part of all of these , little things and big objects , life is a question of choices .
And once the world was this : <unk> , there were some possibility , but it wasn 't a question of choice .
The world today is , <unk> to this : <unk> is , it 's a <unk> thing , or <unk> ?
The answer is <unk> .
<unk> <unk> we all know , so I 'm going to talk about the <unk> .
We <unk> this choice <unk> two effects effects .
The first one , <unk> , is that <unk> <unk> instead of <unk> .
With many <unk> between which choose , it becomes very difficult to do it .
I 'll give you an example , a study <unk> on <unk> <unk> .
A <unk> of my <unk> <unk> data , the <unk> <unk> society , with about a million <unk> <unk> in different <unk> companies .
What she 's found is that for every 10 solutions that are <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> two percent .
With 50 <unk> <unk> , there 's 10 percent in less <unk> than <unk> <unk> <unk> , when they 're only <unk> . Why ?
Because with 50 <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that you have to decide , and choice is <unk> to <unk> .
And <unk> , and yet <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and of course , <unk> never comes .
<unk> that doesn 't mean just that these <unk> <unk> <unk> food to <unk> because they don 't have enough money , it also wants to to say that the decision is so <unk> that they <unk> also <unk> the <unk> <unk> of work .
<unk> <unk> , they 're <unk> to <unk> <unk> for <unk> year from the <unk> of work , which would be well well well well .
So <unk> is a <unk> of having <unk> choices .
And I think <unk> the world like this .
" And to end , for <unk> : <unk> , <unk> or <unk> ? "
You know , you know , if it 's for <unk> , right ?
You don 't want to choose the wrong , and <unk> the wrong <unk> .
So that 's the first effect . The second is that even if we can <unk> the <unk> and make a choice , at the end , we 're less <unk> by the result of how to <unk> , <unk> <unk> between which .
And that for several reasons .
One of these is that with many <unk> between which to choose , if you <unk> one and it 's not perfect , it 's easy to imagine that they could make a different choice that would be better . And what 's going to happen is that the <unk> <unk> us to <unk> <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> <unk> from choice , and the <unk> <unk> ,
And even when it was a <unk> decision .
More choices there are , <unk> <unk> than any <unk> that 's <unk> of <unk> .
<unk> , there 's what <unk> call <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> has <unk> very well as the value that we give things <unk> from what <unk> <unk> .
<unk> rest , when there 's so many <unk> , it 's easy to <unk> the <unk> of <unk> <unk> and be <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> that is choice .
Here 's one example . I 'm <unk> with all the ones that are not in New York .
But that 's what 's probably <unk> .
There 's this <unk> <unk> .
A place of <unk> .
<unk> <unk> . <unk> day . It 's all about them .
I don 't know anything . But what he thinks is , " Well , <unk> , it 's <unk> . "
" All my <unk> <unk> <unk> . "
" <unk> <unk> <unk> right in front of the house . "
And it <unk> two weeks from the idea that 's <unk> -- every day -- the <unk> <unk> where it wants to .
The <unk> <unk> <unk> for what we have , even when the choice was <unk> .
And the <unk> are the <unk> we have from <unk> , the <unk> <unk> us against the <unk> .
Here 's another example .
This <unk> tells us a lot of things .
It 's about the moment , and maybe of the living living in slowly .
But the most important point is that anything you 're <unk> , you 're <unk> to do not .
The things that don 't <unk> have so many <unk> that can make less <unk> what we do .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> <unk> .
I tried it on my skin <unk> a new couple of <unk> .
It 's <unk> always <unk> .
Once the <unk> were a <unk> , just a guy , <unk> them and <unk> by <unk> , were <unk> , just after they had a life and <unk> a lot of times , <unk> to go well .
So , I went to <unk> a new couple when the <unk> were gone , and I said , " I need a couple of <unk> , this is my <unk> . "
The <unk> <unk> said to me , " You want to <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> ? "
You want them to <unk> or <unk> ? " <unk> " or " <unk> " ? "
" <unk> wants them to <unk> ? "
" <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> or <unk> ? <unk> <unk> <unk> -- " <unk> <unk> .
I was <unk> , and after a little bit I was able to say , " I want the guy that was the only guy , " I didn 't know what it was , so for an hour now , I all <unk> <unk> <unk> , and then I was <unk> <unk> <unk> , and then I was <unk> <unk> , and then I was <unk> <unk> <unk> ,
It was <unk> . <unk> all that choice I had <unk> the best .
But I 'm going to get worse .
Why ? I wrote a whole book to <unk> .
The reason I was worse is that with all that choice my <unk> were <unk> , the <unk> <unk> to be <unk> .
At the beginning I had <unk> <unk> . I didn 't know , I was <unk> <unk> , I just <unk> a guy , but when they had to be 100 different , <unk> , at least one guy had to be perfect .
What I was <unk> was good , but not perfect .
And after I <unk> that I <unk> with what I was <unk> in <unk> to <unk> .
The <unk> of <unk> in the lives of the people don 't do <unk> the <unk> that these have respect to the <unk> of the same .
And that <unk> less <unk> , even when the results are good .
<unk> in the world of the <unk> <unk> .
Because if I <unk> it , I 'm not talking about what I 'm talking about .
The truth <unk> to that .
And it was better when he was <unk> , " The reason why he was <unk> to be worse when he was <unk> as much as you can <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> , in the world that we live in the world -- <unk> , <unk> citizens with the <unk> of <unk> -- the <unk> that we can <unk> is that the things are at the <unk> of <unk> .
You never have to <unk> <unk> because your <unk> , my <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
The <unk> of happiness -- what you 're here -- is , " <unk> <unk> " Yes , you want to <unk> it . "
I mean -- small <unk> moment -- which I 'm really <unk> and my wife is really <unk> .
I couldn 't do better , I didn 't <unk> me .
But <unk> , it 's not always a <unk> thing .
<unk> , a <unk> of <unk> <unk> when there 's just that kind of <unk> is that when there 's just that kind of <unk> is that when you 're not <unk> , and I 'm going to ask you , " Why ? "
Who is <unk> ? " <unk> is <unk> .
The world is <unk> . What can I do ?
When there are hundreds of kinds of <unk> , and I 'll give you a <unk> , and you 'll give you who 's the <unk> , it 's clear that the <unk> is <unk> .
We could have better .
With hundreds of <unk> <unk> available , there are no <unk> for <unk> .
So when people make decisions , even if the result is <unk> , they <unk> <unk> and give them their <unk> .
In the last few years , the <unk> <unk> in the world .
I think a <unk> <unk> -- not the only one , but important -- this <unk> of <unk> is just that people have <unk> <unk> because the standard are too <unk> .
And when they have to <unk> this situation they think <unk> is them .
So the final result , that we 're better better , <unk> , but we 'll have worse .
Let me <unk> you .
This is the <unk> <unk> , what we all take for good and it 's completely <unk> . It 's not true .
There 's no <unk> that a little bit of choice is better than <unk> that you don 't know that much choice is better than a little bit .
There 's a <unk> value , <unk> . I don 't know what it 's .
But I 'm <unk> enough we <unk> from a piece of the level of the level of our lives .
Now , from a <unk> point -- I 've been <unk> -- from the <unk> of <unk> , <unk> is <unk> .
What <unk> allows all this choice in society is <unk> material .
There are many places in the world , and you know , <unk> <unk> , where the problem is not that they have <unk> choice .
The problem is they have too <unk> .
So the <unk> that I 'm talking about is a <unk> <unk> of <unk> , <unk> society .
And what <unk> does <unk> and <unk> is this : <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> you yesterday about how those <unk> and <unk> <unk> to <unk> it . It 's a <unk> of money .
I mean that these choices , <unk> and <unk> , it 's not just <unk> .
They 're <unk> <unk> .
They do it worse .
If a little bit of what our society <unk> is <unk> to be <unk> in those where people have too few <unk> , it 's not just their life to <unk> , but our <unk> .
This is what <unk> call a <unk> <unk> .
A <unk> of income does well , not just the poor -- not just the poor -- because of this choice in <unk> that <unk> us .
And to end , " <unk> , you can become everything that you want to --
<unk> , people of culture , <unk> , " But what 's the fish ? "
It 's <unk> that you can 't do anything in a glass <unk> . "
" A <unk> imagination , a <unk> <unk> vision of the world --
and <unk> I <unk> it so , at the beginning .
But then , <unk> , I <unk> that fish knows that that fish knows .
Because the reality of the fact of the <unk> is that if you <unk> the <unk> , so that it 's possible , you can 't <unk> the freedom . It <unk> .
If you look at the <unk> so that everything can <unk> <unk> the <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Everybody needs a <unk> .
This is almost certainly too <unk> , maybe even for the fish , and certainly for us .
But the <unk> of some <unk> <unk> is a <unk> for <unk> and , for <unk> , for <unk> .
Thank you so much .
