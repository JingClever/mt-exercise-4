<unk> years ago , here at TED , <unk> <unk> <unk> a challenge of <unk> called the <unk> challenge .
And the idea is very simple .
<unk> of four people have to build the <unk> possible <unk> that you can <unk> in your feet , <unk> 20 <unk> , a <unk> of <unk> <unk> , a <unk> of <unk> and a <unk> .
<unk> has to be <unk> at the top of the <unk> .
And , even though it looks very simple , actually , it 's pretty hard , because it <unk> people very quickly <unk> .
So I thought it was an interesting idea , and I <unk> it in a lab on the <unk> .
And it was a huge success .
And since then , I 've <unk> about 70 <unk> of these kinds of <unk> around the world with students students , designers and <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
There is something in this <unk> that <unk> <unk> about the nature of the <unk> , and I would like to share some of these <unk> with you .
<unk> , most people start with the <unk> <unk> .
They 're talking about it , it might look like , <unk> for the power , then <unk> the <unk> time , <unk> .
<unk> of <unk> and <unk> the <unk> .
<unk> most of the time <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> structures and , at the end , just when the time is going to <unk> , somebody <unk> out the <unk> , and they <unk> the <unk> on the top , they make a <unk> back and <unk> .
<unk> the work .
But what 's really going on , most of the time , is that the " <unk> " <unk> " because the weight of the <unk> does <unk> <unk> and <unk> the entire structure .
There is a number of people who have many more <unk> moments " <unk> of others , and among the <unk> business <unk> .
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and they create absolutely <unk> structures .
And there are of course <unk> that have many more structures <unk> , and , in the best , there are the <unk> schools .
And it 's incredible .
As <unk> says , it 's not only <unk> the most <unk> , but they are the most interesting structures structures .
And your question is , how is it possible ? Why is it possible ? Why is that ?
And I could say , " No one of the kids spend time trying to become the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> . " Right .
They don 't spend time <unk> for power .
But there is another reason .
And the reason is that the students of economics are <unk> to find the best project .
And then it <unk> .
And after , what happens is that when you <unk> the <unk> on the top , they don 't have any time , and what happens ?
<unk> .
<unk> you <unk> ? Right .
What the children are <unk> , is that they 're <unk> by the <unk> , and <unk> <unk> , one after another , <unk> , they always <unk> the top of the <unk> , so many possibilities of <unk> <unk> <unk> along the <unk> .
<unk> designers <unk> that this kind of <unk> is the <unk> of <unk> process .
And with every version , the kids have a <unk> <unk> on what doesn 't work .
So , the ability to work on <unk> is <unk> , but we see how they work different groups .
The average <unk> for most people is about 50 <unk> <unk> , for the students of economics , about half , <unk> , <unk> , a little bit better , but not very , much children better than most adults .
Who makes better than everybody ?
<unk> and engineers , through the sky .
<unk> <unk> is the <unk> structure I 've ever seen .
And why ? Because it <unk> that the <unk> and <unk> models are the key to build <unk> structures .
Then we have the <unk> <unk> , a little bit better than the average .
But here 's where it becomes interesting .
If you <unk> a <unk> <unk> , the group to do much better .
It 's incredible . You go a little around , you know , " <unk> <unk> that the <unk> group . " And why ?
because they have <unk> <unk> the <unk> work .
<unk> the process , we <unk> it .
And all the groups who <unk> and pay attention to work in the <unk> way the result of the team .
<unk> <unk> and <unk> of <unk> , and their <unk> <unk> <unk> .
If you have 10 groups who usually work well , you 're going to be <unk> that are on your feet .
And I <unk> an interesting experiment .
I thought , " <unk> the <unk> for once .
I put on the <unk> <unk> dollars of <unk> into software team .
What do you think that 's happened to design students ?
What was the result ?
That 's what happened .
No one of the team has created a <unk> structure .
If only one of them had built a <unk> structure , would have taken the <unk> .
It 's not interesting that a big <unk> ?
We 've <unk> again the <unk> with the <unk> students .
What do you think has happened ?
Now they <unk> the value of a <unk> .
The same team , from <unk> has become the best .
They 've created the <unk> structure in the <unk> time .
So they 're important <unk> about the nature of <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> then . <unk> : Why should someone spend time writing a <unk> challenge ?
The reason is this : help creating <unk> tools and <unk> to help groups build cars , <unk> and <unk> effects .
And what it does a <unk> challenge is to help <unk> <unk> .
Why , <unk> , every project has his <unk> , not that way ?
The challenge was to <unk> an <unk> experience , a common position to build a common position to build a <unk> .
And so , this is the experience , of this simple <unk> .
And those of you who are interested in <unk> .
It 's a <unk> where you can take a look at how to build <unk> .
There are <unk> <unk> .
There are examples from all over the world about how people <unk> and <unk> the system .
There is also the <unk> of the world .
And the most important lesson , I think , is that design is really a <unk> of contact .
<unk> the <unk> of all the <unk> , and the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> and the <unk> to <unk> the challenge you have in your hand .
And sometimes , a little <unk> of this experience is everything that you need to <unk> a moment " <unk> " at a moment " <unk> . "
And this can really make a difference .
Thank you very much .
<unk> <unk> of having a car here , big , beautiful , beautiful , <unk> , is a time machine .
Everybody in this room have to <unk> .
You can go back , you can go back ; you can 't go back , where you 're .
And I would be <unk> to know what I was , because I asked my friends in the last few times , and everybody want to go back .
I don 't know . Let me go back to before there were the car or <unk> , or " <unk> <unk> . "
I don 't know .
I 'm <unk> that there is a kind of <unk> to the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> .
But I 'm not part of that group , I have to <unk> it .
I don 't want to go back , and not because I 'm <unk> , it 's because the chance on this planet doesn 't <unk> go back , go back .
So I want to go into the car and I want to go on .
This is the best time that there 's been on this planet in every field that we can measure : health , <unk> , opportunities , <unk> of disease .
There was never a time like this .
My <unk> <unk> , everyone , before the 60 .
My <unk> would have that number 70 .
My parents are to <unk> 80 .
So it 's better that there is a <unk> at the beginning of my death .
But it 's not only about people like us , it 's a much bigger thing than this .
A child born in New <unk> today can <unk> to live as much as the most <unk> man in the world of 100 years ago .
<unk> . It 's an incredible <unk> .
How does it be true ?
<unk> . <unk> has <unk> billion people on this planet .
It changed the <unk> of <unk> as no war has ever done .
If <unk> is gone . <unk> .
We <unk> it . <unk> .
In the <unk> world , diseases that <unk> million people only a generation ago , there 's no longer basically .
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> --
Who knows what they 're going to be ?
<unk> , <unk> medicine , our <unk> of <unk> billion people , these are <unk> of the scientific <unk> .
And <unk> to me , the scientific <unk> , to try things , see if they work , <unk> when they don 't work , is one of the big results of humanity .
These were the good news .
<unk> , they were the good news because there are other problems , and they have been <unk> many times , to one of them is that , even though all we <unk> , one billion people go to bed <unk> on this planet , every day .
This number is <unk> , with incredible <unk> , and it 's <unk> .
And not only , we used our creativity to <unk> the planet .
<unk> <unk> , <unk> land , <unk> <unk> , oil , natural gas : they 're <unk> , and they 're <unk> in fast , and if we don 't <unk> our <unk> to <unk> out of this <unk> , <unk> <unk> us .
So the question is : can I do it ? I think it is .
I think it 's clear that you can produce food to <unk> billion people without <unk> the earth that they live on .
I think it 's possible to <unk> this world of energy without this .
I really think that , and no , it 's not a <unk> <unk> .
But that 's the thing that <unk> me <unk> at night -- one of the things that <unk> me at night .
We 've never had the <unk> <unk> as we need now , and we have now , and we 've never been in the <unk> position of <unk> to the best of how we might have today .
We 're at a <unk> of incredible events , really , in a lot of <unk> .
But yet , I think we should go back , 300 years , before the <unk> , to find a time when we <unk> the <unk> , a time when we <unk> the <unk> , a time when we 've <unk> them more <unk> , and more <unk> , than we do now .
People <unk> in what they believe , and they do it with <unk> force that we can 't <unk> .
<unk> the truth can <unk> .
<unk> , everyone <unk> to their own <unk> ; they also have the right to their progress <unk> , but you know what are you don 't ?
You don 't have to your <unk> . You can 't .
I put it a little <unk> .
A <unk> of years ago , I wrote a story about " The New <unk> , " a short article . "
And I was <unk> that somebody <unk> , which was <unk> to what is , after all , the measure of public health care of all human history .
I didn 't know what to do , so I did as <unk> , I did the story and I did .
Not much later , I wrote a story about <unk> <unk> food .
<unk> thing , only bigger .
People were <unk> .
So I wrote a story even story about that , and I couldn 't understand why people are going to <unk> the <unk> as " food , " because we want to <unk> the molecules in a <unk> way , it was <unk> the work of nature .
But , as I always , I do my job . I wrote the story and I went on .
I mean , I 'm a <unk> . <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> there .
But these stories <unk> me and I couldn 't understand why , but at the end of them .
The problem was that those <unk> that they were <unk> to me , they were <unk> at all .
They were <unk> people , <unk> people for good .
They were exactly like people in this room .
And it was very much --
But then I thought , since , we have to be <unk> ; we 're at a point on this planet , where we don 't have the same relationship with progress that there was a time .
We talk about it so much .
We 're going to talk about it in terms of the <unk> , " <unk> . " All right , there are reasons to do that , and I think we know what they are .
We lost <unk> in institutions , in <unk> , and sometimes in science itself , and it 's happened .
We had to do just some <unk> <unk> and people .
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> of mass <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
I mean , everybody has his list .
We have questions and problems with the people who are always right .
So <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
I didn 't know anything about it .
But here 's the fundamental point : when the evidence comes to <unk> , and we 're not very <unk> in this .
And I think the reason is that we find in a <unk> of fear that I had never seen and I hope that I 've never seen and I 'm never going to <unk> .
<unk> 12 years ago , a story <unk> , a story <unk> , that <unk> there was a <unk> between a <unk> of <unk> and the <unk> against <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
Very <unk> .
<unk> of studies were made to see if it was true .
And they <unk> hundreds of studies ; it 's a important issue .
They end up the data .
<unk> from the United States , England , from <unk> , <unk> , and everybody was <unk> , no <unk> , no <unk> , no <unk> , no <unk> , no <unk> .
He didn 't <unk> it . He didn 't do it , because we believe what we see -- what we think about seeing -- what we think about seeing .
We don 't believe a <unk> of <unk> <unk> from the government that show us , and I <unk> it , I think we 're all <unk> .
But you know what ?
The results have been <unk> --
That 's why a fact is : the United States is a few countries in the world where the number of <unk> against the <unk> is <unk> .
It 's <unk> , and we should <unk> ourselves .
It 's terrible .
What has happened that <unk> us to do something like that ?
Now , I 'm going to do it .
<unk> , anybody here has the <unk> ?
<unk> in the audience have ever seen a person died of <unk> ?
It doesn 't often happen .
In this country , it doesn 't happen , but it 's been <unk> times in the world last year .
I 'm a lot of dead for <unk> , 20 every hour .
But since it 's not here , we can <unk> out of their head , and people like <unk> <unk> can go around <unk> <unk> of fear and <unk> <unk> as <unk> or <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And they can do it because they don 't <unk> the difference between <unk> and <unk> .
They don 't believe that these two things seem <unk> , but they are almost never almost ever .
But it 's something that we need to learn , and we have to <unk> quickly .
<unk> man was a <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
He <unk> the humanity from one of his <unk> <unk> .
<unk> fear , no <unk> -- the <unk> , <unk> -- <unk> .
The man in the middle , not <unk> .
It 's called Paul <unk> .
He just created a <unk> against the <unk> together with other people .
It <unk> the life of 400 , <unk> children every year in the developing world .
<unk> <unk> , right ?
It 's <unk> , if it wasn 't that Paul goes around talking about <unk> , it says how <unk> they are <unk> and that people should just <unk> <unk> .
And he says it in these terms .
So Paul is <unk> a <unk> .
When Paul talks in a public <unk> can 't <unk> without a <unk> <unk> .
They call it home because some people like <unk> who know where his children are in school .
Why ? Because Paul created a <unk> .
I don 't have to <unk> , but the <unk> are <unk> .
If you <unk> <unk> , <unk> disease , <unk> disease , and it 's going on .
We have again the <unk> in this country .
And it will be worse , and it 's going to be <unk> , because it 's just a question of numbers .
And it 's not just <unk> .
<unk> ? <unk> even that . Why don 't you ?
One of my favorite <unk> of the <unk> has written me a couple of weeks ago , and he told me that a little <unk> .
No one had told me that before .
She wouldn 't have her son against the <unk> .
<unk> <unk> .
OK .
Why ? Because there is no <unk> . But you know what ?
We didn 't have the <unk> in the United States .
Now , I don 't know -- maybe <unk> a guy is based on a <unk> <unk> , and it 's <unk> to <unk> <unk> , now it 's over the <unk> .
<unk> <unk> in a couple of hours , <unk> a car , <unk> here in <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> to one of these <unk> <unk> <unk> from TED .
He doesn 't know it 's been <unk> by a <unk> disease , and we don 't even know it because it 's how the world works .
This is the planet that we live in . We don 't do <unk> that .
We <unk> <unk> of <unk> . <unk> do it .
<unk> <unk> <unk> ?
<unk> , a little bit of <unk> to start the day .
I know you 've done it because the half of the Americans do it every day .
<unk> that stuff , as you <unk> to <unk> medicine , and it doesn 't matter how often <unk> that they are <unk> .
<unk> always <unk> it .
<unk> the <unk> <unk> . More than they do , almost never do .
But it 's good , you want to spend <unk> billion dollars for <unk> <unk> , are with you !
<unk> <unk> . <unk> .
Why do we do that ? Why do we do that ?
I think I 'm going to <unk> the big <unk> <unk> .
It <unk> the great machine . It doesn 't <unk> us .
And we do well . Our <unk> system .
It 's <unk> to millions of people .
It 's absolutely incredibly cold and <unk> for those of us that they can <unk> .
So you get away , and who 's <unk> ?
<unk> between the <unk> of the great <unk> .
It 's fantastic . We <unk> the great <unk> .
You know , it 's a serious problem because this stuff is a <unk> , and we 're <unk> billion dollars .
I have a whole series of examples here .
<unk> of these -- <unk> -- a <unk> , <unk> -- a <unk> , <unk> -- I don 't even know what it 's but we 're <unk> billion dollars , and it 's a <unk> .
You know what ? When I say these things , people <unk> me against , and they say , " What are you interested in ? " <unk> that people do what they want .
It makes them right . "
<unk> a little bit ? You <unk> .
Because I don 't care if it 's the <unk> <unk> for <unk> and <unk> <unk> to say , " <unk> , " <unk> , I don 't have to hear the evidence of the <unk> or if it says some <unk> <unk> of the cancer who wants to <unk> the <unk> patients .
When we <unk> the road that <unk> to <unk> science and <unk> with <unk> and <unk> , <unk> in a place where you 're not going to be .
<unk> like <unk> <unk> in South Africa .
He <unk> 400 <unk> of his <unk> <unk> to say that <unk> , <unk> and <unk> of <unk> <unk> better than the <unk> <unk> that we can <unk> the <unk> of AIDS .
<unk> of thousands of dead <unk> in a country that was <unk> more than any other than this disease .
Please , I don 't <unk> <unk> that there are no <unk> for these <unk> .
There are .
Now , the most <unk> <unk> that we 're in right now is the <unk> war between the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> food .
It 's a <unk> <unk> . <unk> end up .
It 's a <unk> on words , on the <unk> .
It 's not science .
Every single thing that <unk> , every <unk> of <unk> , every <unk> of <unk> , every <unk> of <unk> has been <unk> by man .
You see , there were no <unk> in the <unk> of <unk> .
There were no <unk> .
There were no <unk> trees . We didn 't even <unk> trees .
We 've done that over the last <unk> years .
<unk> has <unk> and something else doesn 't .
And we <unk> what we don 't understand .
Now we can do it more <unk> .
And there are some <unk> , of course .
But we can <unk> things like <unk> A <unk> in <unk> , and this <unk> million people , millions of people , <unk> their lives .
And we don 't want to do it ?
I have to tell you , I don 't know .
We 're <unk> to <unk> .
Why ?
The things that I always feel : <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , we don 't want <unk> fields with the same thing , is wrong .
We don 't want the <unk> companies on life .
We don 't want the <unk> companies are <unk> <unk> .
You know , my answer to this ?
It 's right . You 're right . <unk> something .
It 's true , we have a huge food problem , but it 's not science .
It has nothing to do with science .
It 's law , <unk> , <unk> lines on <unk> .
You know that science is not a <unk> .
It 's not a country .
It 's not even an idea ; it 's a process .
It 's a process , sometimes it <unk> doesn 't , but the idea that we shouldn 't have to <unk> science to do its work , because we 're afraid is actually very <unk> , and it 's <unk> to millions of people of <unk> .
You know , in the next 50 years , we 're going to produce 70 percent .
These are the <unk> in the last 30 years .
<unk> . <unk> .
They need and we don 't need it .
Why ? <unk> <unk> <unk> .
We don 't want to <unk> people to eat <unk> like <unk> .
<unk> billion people <unk> .
<unk> a little bit of a <unk> .
But they just <unk> . <unk> <unk> .
He didn 't <unk> <unk> , but the scientists are <unk> the way to <unk> right now .
So a lot of people could eat and <unk> less the risk of getting <unk> .
Don 't talk about <unk> , and you know what ?
It would be beautiful . It wouldn 't be a <unk> <unk> , but it would be very beautiful .
<unk> <unk> just : Why are we against ?
I mean , <unk> : why are we <unk> this thing ?
Just because we don 't want to <unk> the genes over there and there ?
It 's about <unk> . It 's not about <unk> <unk> .
It 's not about our <unk> <unk> for <unk> , or our <unk> to have food , better , better .
There is no <unk> <unk> .
It 's about <unk> the life of people , and it would be now <unk> to understand what it means .
Why is -- you want to <unk> ? -- if you don 't <unk> it , and <unk> to <unk> how we <unk> now , <unk> <unk> of something that I don 't think about <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
There 's no way to <unk> what 's going on .
It 's <unk> , it 's <unk> , it 's in front of us , and we have to <unk> them .
So , after this <unk> conversation , you might say , " Do you still go into this <unk> machine of time and go into the future ? "
Of course , I want .
It 's <unk> right now , but we have an incredible opportunity .
We can <unk> the car of time as we want .
We have a chance to go where we want , and we 're going to do this .
We have to make these <unk> , and we have to think , but when we <unk> in the car time and go on <unk> happy to do it .
I know that we can and , as as far , I think the world needs right now .
Thank you .
Thank you .
One day , the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> Times was <unk> in the streets of <unk> <unk> <unk> when I was <unk> a beautiful music .
<unk> <unk> by a man , a <unk> <unk> , fascinating , with the <unk> <unk> , without <unk> that he had just two <unk> .
I 'm <unk> a story that many of you know , because the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , the <unk> of a book , which , <unk> , <unk> , was <unk> to the big screen , with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> in the part of <unk> <unk> <unk> , the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> that <unk> was <unk> .
<unk> <unk> the <unk> , <unk> a terrible <unk> <unk> , and 30 years later , <unk> as a <unk> without <unk> <unk> in the middle of <unk> <unk> .
You 're all going to read the book of <unk> , or looking at the movie to understand not just the <unk> <unk> that <unk> between these two men ,
My name is <unk> <unk> . I 'm a <unk> <unk> of <unk> .
<unk> online for 10 years and my <unk> for 10 years , and my <unk> for the next 10 years , is to try to save the world in real life .
To do that I have a plan , and I 'm going to <unk> all of you , <unk> all of you , to spend more <unk> <unk> .
At the time we <unk> three billion hours a week , online .
Some of you might think , " <unk> a little bit of time . "
maybe too long , <unk> how many <unk> problems we have to solve in the real world .
In fact , in my research , <unk> the <unk> for the <unk> , actually is the <unk> .
<unk> billion hours a week , they 're not <unk> to solve the most <unk> problems in the world .
In fact , I think that if we want to survive the next century on this planet , we have to <unk> that <unk> .
I <unk> the total of which we need is <unk> billion hours of play every week .
It 's probably a <unk> idea , so the <unk> , to <unk> the concept .
If we want to solve problems which <unk> , poverty , the climate change , the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> , I think we have the <unk> to play , for at least <unk> billion hours to the <unk> , for the end of the next <unk> . No , they 're really <unk> .
That 's why . This <unk> picture is why I think it 's so important for the <unk> of human species . <unk> . <unk> .
This is a <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> , wanted to <unk> the game of the game .
So he 's <unk> <unk> as <unk> .
And this is a <unk> <unk> of play .
If you 're not <unk> <unk> , you can tell some of the <unk> of this picture .
You probably can see that sense of <unk> , a little <unk> , but also a very <unk> <unk> , a very difficult attention to deal with a very difficult problem .
If you 're <unk> <unk> , <unk> some of the <unk> around the eyes , and around the mouth are a <unk> <unk> .
And the <unk> <unk> show .
This is a <unk> <unk> at a step from something called a <unk> <unk> .
<unk> , it 's a term that you 've already heard . OK .
So we have <unk> <unk> between us .
A <unk> <unk> is such a <unk> result that doesn 't seem possible until you can <unk> it .
It 's almost beyond the <unk> of the imagination , and when we <unk> is a <unk> to find out what you 're really capable of . This is a <unk> <unk> .
This <unk> is a step from a <unk> <unk> .
And this is the <unk> that we need to see on the <unk> of millions of <unk> of the problems in the world as we <unk> the <unk> of the next hundred years . <unk> the <unk> of someone who , all the <unk> , is a step from a <unk> <unk> .
<unk> this is the <unk> that we see in life of all the day while we 're trying to deal with <unk> problems .
This is the <unk> I call , " I 'm not <unk> . " I 'm in <unk> . " And I 'm in <unk> . "
I 'm with the <unk> , " I 'm not <unk> in the <unk> . "
This is a <unk> in my old neighborhood of <unk> , California , where I did the <unk> on why we 're <unk> more <unk> in the game that in real life .
And this is a whole problem of a lot of <unk> <unk> <unk> : <unk> that we are actually not as as much as in games .
And I don 't mean " <unk> " just as " success , " even if the success is part : <unk> more results in online .
But I also mean " <unk> " in the sense of <unk> to do something important , <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
And when we 're in an online world , I think a lot of us become the best <unk> of themselves , the most capable of help without <unk> , more to help without <unk> , more capable of <unk> after a <unk> and <unk> .
And in the real life , when you <unk> a <unk> , when you <unk> a <unk> , often , we don 't like this . <unk> <unk> , maybe <unk> <unk> or <unk> .
I will never <unk> these <unk> as they <unk> , just don 't exist in a game .
So this is what I wanted to study at university .
What is that in a game <unk> us to feel that we can 't get any <unk> ?
How can we <unk> those <unk> from games and <unk> to the real world ?
So I 've studied games as a <unk> of <unk> , which is the <unk> environment to solve solve problems in a <unk> way .
And I began to notice some things that make <unk> <unk> so possible in <unk> online .
The first is that , when you <unk> in one of these <unk> online , especially in the <unk> of <unk> , there are <unk> characters different characters that <unk> to save the world . They 're <unk> by <unk> a mission to save the world . They 're <unk> by <unk> .
But not any mission that is perfectly <unk> to your <unk> <unk> on the current level . Right ?
So you can <unk> it .
They never give you an impossible challenge .
But it 's <unk> . So you have to <unk> <unk> .
But there is no <unk> in the <unk> of <unk> , you don 't have the time to <unk> the <unk> , there 's always something <unk> and important to do .
And there are <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , hundreds of thousands of people , <unk> <unk> to you to <unk> your <unk> mission .
It 's not a common thing in real life , this feeling that feeling that there are <unk> <unk> .
And there 's also this <unk> <unk> , this <unk> that <unk> , about why we are there , and what we 're doing .
And then I <unk> this whole <unk> --
you 've heard of <unk> <unk> and <unk> one of force , and <unk> one in intelligence .
They don 't <unk> that kind of <unk> <unk> in real life .
When I <unk> this stage , you wouldn 't have to <unk> <unk> <unk> in front of an audience , and <unk> one in <unk> ideas .
They don 't <unk> that kind of <unk> in real life .
Now , the problem of the <unk> online as <unk> of <unk> is that it <unk> so <unk> <unk> to be at a step from a <unk> <unk> <unk> all of our time in these play <unk> .
<unk> is better than the reality .
That 's why , <unk> , <unk> all of the <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> have spent <unk> million years <unk> to solve the problems of <unk> .
This is not <unk> a <unk> thing .
But <unk> in perspective : <unk> million years ago was the time when one of our <unk> <unk> <unk> up .
That was the first <unk> <unk> to walk .
Okay , so when we 're talking about how long we 're <unk> in playing , the only <unk> way even <unk> , is to talk about <unk> times as well , because we found that <unk> is an extraordinary thing , but also , because we 've found that we are capable of <unk> what we 're able to play this time to play , we 're <unk> what we 're capable of being able to <unk> and more .
This is true , I think .
So let 's look at this interesting <unk> .
It was <unk> by a <unk> at <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The young <unk> <unk> today in a country with a strong culture of <unk> , will have spent <unk> hours <unk> online , at the age of <unk> .
<unk> hours is an interesting number for two reasons .
First of all , for the children in the United States <unk> hours is the <unk> number of hours that <unk> at school from the <unk> to the <unk> , if you are present every day .
So we have a whole path of education <unk> in which young people <unk> as being <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> at time in school in which they <unk> the rest of them .
And some of you may have probably read the new book of <unk> <unk> , " <unk> . "
If you 've made it read about his theory of success , the theory of <unk> hours for success .
It 's based on a <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of <unk> , which is that if you <unk> hours of the <unk> age of <unk> in that field .
<unk> <unk> in that something as much as the best people in the world .
So , what we have now is a whole generation of young young people are <unk> of play .
So , the question is , " <unk> , what these <unk> become <unk> ? "
because if we could figure out what it 's going to be about a <unk> of human resources .
This is the number of people in the world <unk> at least an hour a day to play online .
These are our genes of the game .
500 million people who are <unk> <unk> -- in something .
And in the next <unk> we 'll have another billion of <unk> <unk> that are <unk> <unk> in that something .
If you don 't understand that , this is what we 're going to do : the <unk> industry is <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> energy and work with the mobile phone phone , instead of the Internet <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of all over the world , especially in India , China , <unk> , <unk> <unk> online .
<unk> is a billion <unk> <unk> in the next <unk> .
This <unk> us to <unk> billion <unk> <unk> .
So I started thinking about what these games are <unk> in genes .
These are four <unk> I <unk> . The first is a <unk> <unk> .
Okay . We 're going to look like a <unk> form of <unk> .
A <unk> <unk> is the wish to act immediately to <unk> a <unk> , with the <unk> of having a <unk> hope of success .
The <unk> <unk> always believe that a <unk> <unk> is possible , and that 's worth <unk> , and it 's <unk> now .
The <unk> <unk> aren 't with your hands .
<unk> <unk> are <unk> in <unk> a social <unk> .
There are a lot of interesting research that show how we better we find with other people , even though they have <unk> .
And the reason is that it takes a lot of trust to play with someone . We <unk> that <unk> with the same rules and the same <unk> as well as the <unk> .
So , I 'm going to <unk> the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> .
It turns out that we really <unk> social relationships .
<unk> <unk> . <unk> .
You know , there is a reason that the <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> hours a week , almost than a week , almost as a <unk> job .
It 's because we know , while we 're <unk> , that we 're actually <unk> , rather than <unk> or <unk> time .
We know that we are <unk> , as being humans , to work <unk> to something that has <unk> .
And the <unk> <unk> are <unk> to work , if it 's <unk> a <unk> task .
<unk> , a <unk> meaning .
<unk> <unk> <unk> to be <unk> <unk> , to human stories on a <unk> scale .
For example , a small information information to help create a context .
They all <unk> , the greatest <unk> in the world .
The second <unk> <unk> in the world , with almost <unk> <unk> is the <unk> of <unk> <unk> million people use it every month .
They 've <unk> more information about <unk> of <unk> in the Internet , which on any other <unk> in the world .
We had building a <unk> <unk> .
We had a number of information <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> .
OK , these are the four <unk> that <unk> together .
<unk> <unk> are individuals of great <unk> <unk> of <unk> .
These are people who believe they 're able to change the world .
The only problem is that they think they 're able to change the <unk> , but not real .
This is the problem that I 'm trying to solve .
There 's a <unk> called <unk> <unk> .
His studies are <unk> . It 's <unk> why people like so much time , energy and energy , in online <unk> .
He said , " We 're <unk> what we 're doing less than a mass <unk> towards the <unk> <unk> and the <unk> of online <unk> . "
And it 's a <unk> , so it 's <unk> , and it says -- not like me , I 'm a <unk> of games , I 'm <unk> --
But he <unk> -- he <unk> that this is a perfectly <unk> thing , because the <unk> <unk> can get more in the online life .
We need to have more <unk> social relationships in a game that doesn 't in real life .
<unk> a better <unk> and <unk> more <unk> in a game that doesn 't in the real life .
So , <unk> , by now , it 's perfectly perfectly <unk> for the <unk> <unk> , spend more <unk> in the real world . And I agree that this is <unk> , for now , but it 's not , in a way , no way , no way , a <unk> situation . We have to start to make the real world <unk> to a game .
This is <unk> <unk> from something that <unk> <unk> years ago .
These are <unk> <unk> , made of <unk> <unk> . <unk> we had <unk> and <unk> <unk> . We had <unk> <unk> of <unk> . And these <unk> the first <unk> <unk> play from humanity .
If you <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> maybe already this story .
It 's the story of who <unk> games and why .
<unk> <unk> that games , particularly the <unk> games , were <unk> in the <unk> of <unk> , during a period of <unk> .
I thought the <unk> was so <unk> , that the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> of doing something <unk> .
People <unk> , the population was in <unk> , was a <unk> situation , they needed a <unk> solution .
So <unk> , <unk> , <unk> the games of <unk> and <unk> a <unk> <unk> for all the <unk> .
One day , everyone would <unk> .
The next day , everybody would have <unk> .
And they <unk> so <unk> in <unk> games , from the moment that you play is so <unk> , and it <unk> us in a state of <unk> <unk> , who <unk> the fact that we don 't have anything to eat .
And so one day <unk> , and a <unk> day .
And a second <unk> , <unk> like 18 years , <unk> to the <unk> <unk> one day and <unk> that <unk> .
I think that 's exactly the way we use games per day .
It <unk> the games for <unk> to the <unk> of the real world .
It <unk> the games to <unk> from everything that doesn 't work in our real environment , from everything that we don 't <unk> in real life , and <unk> what we need from games .
But we don 't have to <unk> it here .
This is interesting <unk> : <unk> <unk> , after 18 years , the <unk> doesn 't <unk> <unk> , so the <unk> <unk> that they were going to have one last <unk> in <unk> .
<unk> the entire <unk> in half , <unk> a <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> of that <unk> <unk> <unk> to an <unk> <unk> .
<unk> the <unk> and <unk> to <unk> a new land where to live , <unk> behind the right number of people to survive with the available resources , with the available , with the hope to bring their <unk> from some other side , where it could have <unk> .
It 's a little <unk> idea , right ?
<unk> , but DNA on the <unk> have <unk> that the <unk> that they were going to <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> the same DNA <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> .
So , <unk> , scientists have <unk> that the story from <unk> is a real story .
And <unk> have found <unk> of a global <unk> that <unk> almost 20 years old , and that could explain the <unk> .
So this incredible story might be true : they could actually have <unk> their <unk> culture , <unk> in the games for 18 years to be so <unk> , and have so <unk> , and know how good you 're going to <unk> the game to save so <unk> the entire civilization .
Okay , we can do it .
<unk> <unk> of <unk> from <unk> .
It was the first game of <unk> in real time of the series of <unk> . This 16 years ago .
They were <unk> for 18 years , we 've <unk> in <unk> for 16 years .
I say , we 're <unk> for our <unk> game .
They <unk> half of the population on a <unk> new world .
It 's from here that <unk> the idea of <unk> billion hours of play last week .
We think half of us <unk> them to move an hour a day to play , until we <unk> the world 's problems .
What you 're going to ask , " How do we solve the problems of the real world in a game ? " Well , that 's what I <unk> my work in the <unk> , <unk> the <unk> for the <unk> .
In our <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> , we have this <unk> that <unk> our idea of how we should be <unk> with the future .
We don 't want to <unk> the future .
What we want to do is <unk> the future .
You can imagine the <unk> from the best results , and then we want to give people to people to <unk> actually <unk> .
You can imagine <unk> <unk> to give people the tools to <unk> them .
I 'm going to show you three games that I 've done , and that are a <unk> of giving people the tools to create <unk> <unk> in their future .
This is " <unk> <unk> <unk> . "
We 've done this game in <unk> .
It 's a online game in which you 're trying to survive a oil <unk> .
<unk> is not real , but we have <unk> material <unk> online to make it believe that it is , and to make life life life as if you <unk> in <unk> . So , when you <unk> in the game , <unk> you get us in the area that <unk> , and we give you the news in real time , and we give you the news in real time , the impact on food ,
the impact on the <unk> , if the schools are <unk> , if there are <unk> , and you have to think about how to <unk> your life , if all this is real . You 're going to <unk> you to have a <unk> about it , <unk> photos .
We <unk> this game with <unk> <unk> in <unk> , and we <unk> them since then , then the three <unk> years old , and what I can tell you is that it 's an experience .
<unk> wants to change the way in which they live only because it 's a good thing for the world or because it 's a good thing .
But if we <unk> them in a <unk> <unk> and the <unk> , " We don 't have oil .
This is an incredible story ! A <unk> that you can <unk> !
<unk> yourself to see how <unk> <unk> . "
Most of our <unk> have then <unk> the <unk> that has learned in the game .
So , for the <unk> game , we decided to save the world , we decided to <unk> higher , to a bigger problem than the oil <unk> .
We 've done a game called <unk> , <unk> for the <unk> , and the <unk> was : a <unk> has <unk> that humanity only has another <unk> years on this planet .
The <unk> is called " <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> . "
We asked people to <unk> online as a <unk> <unk> movie .
I <unk> them the movie of <unk> <unk> , <unk> a team of dream : there is <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and they have something to save the world , but in our game game , instead of having only five people in the dream team , and they 're part of the dream of the future of the <unk> , the future of energy resources , the future of the future .
<unk> people have <unk> for eight weeks , they 've <unk> 500 solutions that you can find if you go online and <unk> on Google " <unk> . "
<unk> , the last game , <unk> <unk> <unk> . This is a game with the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> .
If you look at the <unk> <unk> from the <unk> <unk> <unk> , like <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
<unk> with <unk> <unk> for Africa , <unk> , we 're trying to learn the <unk> of social innovation .
There is a story in <unk> , <unk> of a <unk> , <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the imagination and the <unk> .
<unk> <unk> all of you to share this game with young young people , everywhere in the world , particularly in the developing world .
It 's time to <unk> .
I want to ask a question .
What do you think you 're going to <unk> ?
We have all these incredible <unk> , and we have these games that are <unk> projects of what we could do , but none of these still <unk> the real world .
Well , I hope that <unk> with me that the <unk> <unk> are a human <unk> that we can use to work in the real world , which games are a powerful powerful <unk> to the change , that we have these incredible <unk> , a <unk> <unk> , the ability to <unk> a <unk> <unk> , the ability to <unk> a <unk> meaning .
I hope that we can <unk> to play play with games that are <unk> , to survive on this planet for another century , and my hope is that I 'm going to <unk> you in <unk> and <unk> <unk> like this .
When we 're going on to the next <unk> , of two things are : that we can make any future we can imagine , and that we can play any game .
So , I say , let 's take the games that <unk> the world .
Thank you .
I 'm interested in the <unk> effect , it can look like a <unk> thing that a <unk> <unk> if you <unk> it , unless you 're <unk> from my point of view , which is something <unk> <unk> is <unk> to be something real <unk> . " In other words , the <unk> of <unk> have a <unk> in some studies , the effect , because the person thinks
that what 's happening is to a <unk> or something like --
The <unk> of pain , for example , if they think they have a <unk> effect in the body called the <unk> effect .
<unk> of <unk> becomes something true for the <unk> that you 've got .
I want to show you a <unk> <unk> <unk> , very simple .
And I 'm going to show you how it works . This is a <unk> that 's present in all the books for children since <unk> .
I learned it from only with <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> .
I <unk> it for you .
And so I 'm going to tell you why I 've <unk> it .
That 's what happens .
The <unk> , you can <unk> it ; my hand , that you can <unk> .
I just got the <unk> in my <unk> , like this .
<unk> on the <unk> .
To be sure that there 's no <unk> or <unk> from my <unk> .
I 'm going to <unk> my <unk> like this .
<unk> that you could see that something could go . <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> here . <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> here .
And the purpose of that is simple .
I 'm going to <unk> my hand , and if it 's gone well , my favorite animal is <unk> the <unk> .
In fact , he <unk> so <unk> to his place I can <unk> , and the <unk> doesn 't <unk> .
<unk> goes up or down from my <unk> .
no <unk> . You can <unk> anything .
<unk> !
This is a <unk> <unk> that often <unk> to children .
which are <unk> to <unk> , because you can learn a lot about the <unk> <unk> this <unk> even though it 's very simple .
Many of you in this room , you know this <unk> .
Here 's what happens is the <unk> in my hand .
Let me <unk> <unk> my <unk> .
to <unk> that nothing <unk> or <unk> from my <unk> , this is a <unk> .
The reason I 'm <unk> the <unk> is because this is the <unk> of the <unk> .
And the moment when my hand moves <unk> from you , this finger here , my <unk> , <unk> <unk> was in a position that <unk> in outside so <unk> .
There is someone who didn 't have an <unk> here .
It 's like this , right here , right .
And when I also <unk> your finger .
We can talk about why it 's <unk> , because it 's not <unk> that there are only three <unk> <unk> because the mind , and the way we <unk> information , not <unk> , one , two , three . I <unk> them .
But it 's not the point . Right ? And when I <unk> my hand , of course , it 's <unk> not through the animal <unk> , but through the <unk> , <unk> my <unk> here .
And when I <unk> my finger , the same thing , when you go back , this movement , he <unk> his finger .
<unk> your hand . <unk> comes away .
It 's a <unk> that you can do with your friends and close . Thank you .
Now , what does this have to do with the <unk> effect ?
I read a study , a year ago that <unk> me .
I 'm not a doctor or a <unk> , so that it was an amazing thing .
It seems that if you <unk> a <unk> in the form of a <unk> <unk> , that 's a <unk> <unk> , only a <unk> <unk> <unk> , has a <unk> effect .
But if you look at the shape and <unk> the <unk> , under a smaller <unk> , and the blue color <unk> , and you <unk> a letter is <unk> .
Even though none of them have any <unk> -- they 're <unk> <unk> .
But a <unk> <unk> is not as <unk> as a blue <unk> .
What ? It really <unk> me .
But anyway , it 's not here .
<unk> are more <unk> than any form .
A <unk> <unk> , which is <unk> by one part and <unk> on the other is better than a <unk> <unk> .
<unk> has a role .
A <unk> twice a day , it 's not as <unk> as three <unk> -- now I don 't remember the <unk> . <unk> .
But the point is --
that these <unk> have a role .
And it also has a role .
And if you want the <unk> <unk> , you have to use a <unk> .
Right ? A <unk> with something -- a couple of <unk> of something <unk> .
<unk> it into a patient --
This is an image so strong in their mind , much <unk> than the <unk> <unk> .
It 's real , this <unk> -- I 'm going to show you another time when we 'll have <unk> .
The point is that the <unk> <unk> is not <unk> like the blue one that 's not as <unk> as <unk> , which is not as a <unk> .
And none of these have a <unk> quality .
It 's just your <unk> that makes them <unk> in your <unk> and <unk> the effect .
I wanted to see if I could take this idea and <unk> to a <unk> <unk> .
And to do something that 's a <unk> <unk> and make it look real .
And we know about the study that when you want an effect , you have to use <unk> .
This is a <unk> of <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
<unk> it a little bit .
This is my meat . This is not special <unk> of <unk> .
This is my skin . This is not a special effect .
I 'm going to <unk> my skin and get this <unk> to the <unk> part of the <unk> .
If you <unk> <unk> -- if I <unk> <unk> -- I made it for some friends in the <unk> <unk> , the other night , and a few that doesn 't <unk> , and a woman is almost <unk> <unk> .
So , if I could <unk> <unk> , I 'm not going to be <unk> for the next <unk> , actually , you know , I 'm going to do the first part here .
You can see , you can look at the other side .
Here 's what happens is here , right here , the beginning of my meat part of my arm I just a little hole .
<unk> . I 'm <unk> you <unk> ?
And now a little bit through my skin , and out of the other hand , like that .
Now , we 're in a position where we were with the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> or less . But you can 't <unk> my <unk> now , right ?
So I 'm going to show it . Here 's one , two , three , four .
I know what people think when they see that .
He said , " <unk> <unk> is not going to be <unk> by <unk> to just <unk> a few minutes . "
So , let me give you a <unk> .
How do you feel good .
Yeah , I know it up there behind , " OK , I didn 't see it well . "
People in the <unk> <unk> are <unk> .
Let me show you a <unk> <unk> .
This is really my skin . It 's not a special effect of <unk> .
This is my meat , and I can <unk> around .
<unk> , if you 're <unk> , look bad . You don 't look .
People at the bottom or <unk> <unk> in a few years , " <unk> , it 's clear that it <unk> some effect , but if it was true .
You see there 's a hole here and a hole here , if it was true . "
Well , I 'm going to go out a <unk> for you .
Here we go .
We are now <unk> the <unk> .
<unk> my arm , and I 'm going to show you that there are no <unk> .
But I think in this context , and with the idea of taking something <unk> and <unk> in something true , the <unk> <unk> is , and I 'm going to come out of the stage .
We spend several times in the next few days I hope you don 't know . Thank you very much .
So , in my life , I met a lot of fish .
I 've only <unk> two .
The first one , <unk> more than a <unk> story .
It was a <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> one of the <unk> on the <unk> .
That fish !
But even better , it was from a <unk> <unk> of the most <unk> <unk> <unk> .
So , I 'm going to put you in the <unk> in the <unk> .
I 've been <unk> in a relationship with this beauty for several months .
One day , the <unk> of the company <unk> , and I decided to talk to a <unk> event to the <unk> of the <unk> .
" <unk> " I said .
This was a company that we tried to solve what 's <unk> a <unk> problem for our <unk> .
How do we keep the fish in our <unk> ?
<unk> the last 50 years , we have <unk> in the <unk> in the same way we 've <unk> to the ground .
<unk> was <unk> .
90 percent of the big fish , the ones that are so much the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> fish .
There 's no <unk> .
So , we <unk> or not the <unk> , the <unk> of fish , <unk> part of our future .
There are a lot of <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> of <unk> fish , the less the <unk> part of them , and they 're <unk> . <unk> the <unk> for example .
A big problem is that there is a <unk> rate of 15 to one .
This means that it takes 15 <unk> of <unk> fish to get a <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
It 's not very sustainable .
And the <unk> is not a big thing .
So here , finally , there was a company that <unk> to do it in the right way .
I wanted to <unk> it .
The day first of the event I <unk> at the <unk> of the company of the company .
<unk> <unk> .
" <unk> , " I said , " <unk> , " as well , you 're <unk> to make <unk> so far , in the open sea , which doesn 't <unk> . "
" <unk> , " he said , " We are so <unk> by the <unk> that our <unk> are <unk> , not <unk> . "
And then we said , " We are basically a world . "
" The <unk> <unk> ? <unk> at one , " he said .
" The best in the sector . "
<unk> to one , fantastic .
" <unk> to one thing ? What is you want to eat to the fish ? "
" <unk> <unk> , " he said . "
" <unk> , " I said , " <unk> . "
That night , I was in bed , <unk> : What 's a sustainable <unk> ?
So the next day , little before the event , we still <unk> .
I said , " <unk> , do you have some example of <unk> <unk> ? "
They knew they did not know , and he would <unk> around .
Well , let 's start with some people in the company , and no one <unk> <unk> response .
<unk> finally <unk> with the <unk> <unk> .
He also <unk> him .
" <unk> , " I said , " Do you have some example of <unk> <unk> ? "
Well , he <unk> some <unk> <unk> some of the fish <unk> , and then he said , " <unk> of <unk> . "
I said , " <unk> <unk> ? "
He said , " Yes , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> and <unk> . "
He said , " <unk> <unk> of your <unk> is made of <unk> ? "
<unk> , let 's say , two percent .
" Well , it 's about 30 percent . "
He said , " <unk> , what 's sustainable , what 's sustainable to <unk> the <unk> fish to eat ? "
There was a long <unk> on the phone , and then said , " there are <unk> <unk> <unk> in the world . "
I <unk> about this fish .
No , because I 'm not one of those <unk> <unk> <unk> of good food and traditional food .
Well , actually , they are .
No , it actually <unk> me about this fish because , I 'm going to tell you after that , the <unk> knew of <unk> .
The second fish is a different <unk> .
It 's a story <unk> that kind of <unk> the story that the <unk> fish and more <unk> it .
I <unk> it for the first time in a <unk> in the <unk> of <unk> .
One of my <unk> <unk> had talked to me about this fish .
<unk> had made us <unk> .
<unk> on the table , it was almost <unk> , almost <unk> .
The <unk> had <unk> it .
<unk> the <unk> of how much it had to be <unk> .
<unk> , it was still <unk> .
Who is able to make a good fish after <unk> <unk> ?
I don 't , but this guy did .
<unk> <unk> .
It 's actually called their <unk> .
No , it had no fish , and it 's not a <unk> .
<unk> , not in the sense that it 's usually <unk> .
It 's a <unk> <unk> . The <unk> is a <unk> of fish in the corner of the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
In the ' <unk> , the <unk> was <unk> by <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> on what before was essentially a <unk> <unk> .
We had to <unk> the earth by building a series of <unk> <unk> <unk> so the water into the river .
Well , we 're not going to make it work not from an economic point .
And , from the point of view <unk> , was a <unk> .
He <unk> something like 90 percent of the birds and , <unk> the place , it 's a lot of birds .
So , in <unk> a company <unk> with a <unk> <unk> <unk> the ground .
What 's going to happen ?
It <unk> the <unk> flow .
<unk> , <unk> the <unk> .
Instead of <unk> the water away from the ground , they <unk> the <unk> for <unk> .
<unk> all the <unk> .
We had a <unk> of fish from <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and this <unk> completely <unk> the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> is incredible .
I mean , it 's never seen something like that .
<unk> the <unk> that seems to be away a million miles and everything that you see are the <unk> <unk> and this <unk> , <unk> land .
I 've been there little time ago with <unk> .
It 's an amazing guy Charles <unk> <unk> and a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Okay ? <unk> <unk> in the middle of this <unk> and I <unk> , <unk> <unk> , I had the <unk> <unk> and <unk> , <unk> the <unk> of biology .
<unk> , I <unk> a white <unk> .
And then he <unk> me the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> .
It turns out that <unk> has <unk> a lot of his career at the <unk> <unk> in Africa .
I asked them as it became such a <unk> of fish .
They said , " <unk> ? I don 't know about fish .
I 'm a <unk> <unk> . "
And <unk> after it still <unk> in <unk> of <unk> birds , <unk> and <unk> plants .
Not <unk> , that was very fascinating , which is , which is something like the <unk> <unk> community .
Yeah , but I was <unk> .
And my head <unk> <unk> to that <unk> fish that I had <unk> at the <unk> <unk> .
So , I said , " <unk> , what makes your fish so good ? "
He <unk> the <unk> .
" I know , I know , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , it 's incredible .
But how about your fish ?
What is your <unk> <unk> rate ?
Well , I 'm going to talk about how they 're a system so <unk> that the fish will <unk> exactly what you <unk> in a <unk> environment .
The <unk> of the plants , the <unk> , the <unk> , it 's all the fish .
The system is so health care that 's completely <unk> .
There are no <unk> .
Have you ever heard of a <unk> <unk> that doesn 't give her animals ?
And I was <unk> around the ground with <unk> , and I said , " <unk> a place like this looks so different than any <unk> I 've ever seen , how do you <unk> ? "
In that time , it was as if the <unk> of a movie had <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> .
<unk> the corner and <unk> a scene between the most incredible thousands and thousands of <unk> <unk> a real <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
" That 's success , " he said . "
" <unk> their <unk> , they 're <unk> .
<unk> <unk> . "
<unk> ? I was completely <unk> .
They said , " <unk> , but they 're not <unk> with your fish ? "
" Yes , " he said .
" <unk> about 20 percent of the fish and the fish <unk> .
<unk> year on this property , there were <unk> birds than <unk> species .
It 's become the largest and one of the most important <unk> <unk> for the birds in all over Europe . "
They said , " <unk> , but a <unk> population of birds is not the last thing that we 're going to be in a <unk> <unk> of fish ? "
<unk> your head , no .
<unk> , " We <unk> <unk> in a <unk> way .
This is a <unk> network .
<unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> the <unk> .
So , most <unk> is <unk> the <unk> of the best <unk> is the system . "
OK , so <unk> : A <unk> <unk> that doesn 't give <unk> to the animals and <unk> its <unk> <unk> .
A <unk> of fish , but also a <unk> for birds .
<unk> , by the way , those <unk> aren 't even there .
<unk> the <unk> in a city <unk> <unk> miles where the conditions of the soil are better for construction .
Every morning , <unk> for <unk> miles and come to the <unk> and every night , you do other <unk> miles per <unk> .
They do it because they 're able to follow the <unk> line of the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> serious .
We have something like the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> so <unk> .
And I said , " <unk> , <unk> <unk> miles until the <unk> and then <unk> miles up to the <unk> and then <unk> miles back to ?
They do it for their little ? "
I was <unk> as if I had just <unk> a song of <unk> <unk> .
He said , " No , they do it because the food is better . "
I don 't talk about the skin of my fish that was <unk> , and I usually don 't like the skin of the fish .
I don 't like <unk> , I don 't like <unk> .
It 's that <unk> <unk> , like <unk> .
It will almost never <unk> it .
<unk> , when I <unk> it in that <unk> of the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> didn 't know about any <unk> <unk> .
He had a <unk> <unk> and <unk> was how to give a <unk> to the ocean .
He <unk> this to <unk> , and he <unk> .
They said , " The skin is like a <unk> .
It 's the last <unk> before anything happened in the body of the fish .
It 's <unk> to <unk> the <unk> . "
And then we <unk> , " But our water has no <unk> . "
OK . It 's a <unk> that doesn 't <unk> its fish .
A <unk> that <unk> their success on the base of its <unk> .
And then I realized that when he says that the <unk> doesn 't have <unk> very much the thing because the water that <unk> in that <unk> comes from the river , which is a river <unk> that <unk> to bring <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And when it <unk> along the system and it <unk> the water is more <unk> than when it 's <unk> .
The system is so health , which <unk> water .
So , not just a <unk> that doesn 't <unk> the animals that only is a <unk> that <unk> its success into the health of his <unk> , but a <unk> that 's literally a <unk> <unk> of water and not just for those fish , but also for me and for you .
Because when the water <unk> , it goes into the <unk> .
It 's a <unk> in the ocean , I know , but I <unk> the <unk> <unk> , and so we can do it because this <unk> of love for how much <unk> is also <unk> .
You could say that it 's a <unk> for the future of good food is that it <unk> .
So what we need now is a new <unk> <unk> of agriculture in which food really really has a good <unk> .
But for many people , that 's a little bit too <unk> .
We 're not <unk> , we <unk> of food .
We 're <unk> .
<unk> the <unk> of the small <unk> .
<unk> the little <unk> <unk> .
<unk> of food <unk> .
<unk> <unk> .
And when you believe that these are the things that <unk> the future of good food , some part , and he says , " <unk> you , even <unk> the <unk> <unk> , but how do you think we can <unk> the entire world ?
How do you think we can <unk> the world ? "
Can I be <unk> ?
It 's a question I don 't like .
No , not because we already have more than enough to be able to <unk> the world .
One billion people <unk> the <unk> today .
One billion -- more than you 've ever been -- because of the enormous <unk> in the distribution , not for the amount of <unk> .
See , I don 't like this question because it <unk> the <unk> of our food system in the last 50 years .
<unk> <unk> <unk> to the <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> to the fish and all over this time , the <unk> industry , they just asked , " If we can make more people more <unk> than what we do ? "
This was <unk> .
It was <unk> .
It was the business plan of agriculture .
<unk> <unk> for what it is , a industry in <unk> a industry that 's quickly <unk> the <unk> capital that makes <unk> possible .
This is not a industry , and it 's not an agriculture .
Our <unk> today is <unk> not because of the <unk> in <unk> , but for the resources in <unk> not for the last <unk> , but for the <unk> , not for the <unk> , but for the <unk> water , not for <unk> , but for the <unk> and not for <unk> and <unk> and <unk> , but for the fish in the fish .
<unk> <unk> the world ?
<unk> <unk> : How are we going to make ourselves <unk> ?
Or better , how can we create the conditions that are <unk> to every local community of <unk> if you ?
To do that , we don 't look at the <unk> industry .
It 's an old and <unk> model .
<unk> everything about capital , chemistry and <unk> , and it 's never really good to eat .
Instead , we look at the <unk> model .
That 's what we 're going to do about two billion years of the work .
<unk> to <unk> , <unk> like <unk> <unk> and <unk> that are not <unk> <unk> as <unk> as <unk> as <unk> as <unk> as <unk> as <unk> as <unk> as they are as well as <unk> as <unk> as they are as <unk> as well , because they are the ones that are also <unk> in the <unk> .
If I have to be really <unk> , they are better <unk> than I 've ever been .
You know , it 's good , because if that 's going to be the good food , it will be <unk> .
Thank you .
I grew up a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> , an hour and forth every day .
And I was always <unk> in a book , a <unk> book , which <unk> my mind in other <unk> , and <unk> , in <unk> form , that <unk> sense of <unk> that I had .
And that <unk> <unk> also in the fact that every time I wasn 't in school , I was out in <unk> , to <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> <unk> , <unk> them to the <unk> .
I was a real <unk> of science .
But it 's always <unk> to try to understand the world , understand the <unk> of the possible .
And my love for the <unk> actually seemed to <unk> the world around me , because what was going on , in the late ' <unk> we were going to the moon , <unk> the <unk> of the ocean , <unk> the <unk> of the ocean , <unk> the <unk> of the ocean , <unk> the <unk> of the ocean and a wonderful world that we could before we wouldn 't even have seen .
So everything seemed to <unk> my passion for <unk> .
And I was an artist .
We had to design . <unk> <unk> .
And <unk> there were no <unk> and this <unk> of movie <unk> , and all these images in the <unk> of the media , I had to create these images in my head .
<unk> , when I <unk> a book , everybody <unk> , through the <unk> of the <unk> , put something on the screen of our <unk> .
And so , my answer was <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , robots , <unk> <unk> , robots , <unk> <unk> , all this stuff .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> behind the text .
That 's because creativity had to find a <unk> way .
And it 's an interesting thing : the <unk> <unk> <unk> programs very much for the fact that there was a <unk> world right here .
<unk> I would never have been going to go into a <unk> world .
It was very <unk> .
But that was a world where I could go for really , right here on Earth , more <unk> and <unk> of what I could ever imagine <unk> these books .
So , I decided I would be a <unk> at 15 years old .
And the only problem was that we <unk> in a small country of the <unk> country .
But I didn 't <unk> <unk> .
I <unk> my father until he found a <unk> school in <unk> , New York , just past the <unk> where I was <unk> .
And so I 've been able to take the <unk> in a <unk> of the <unk> in the full <unk> in <unk> , New York .
And I didn 't have the ocean , the real ocean , for another two years , until we <unk> us in California .
<unk> then , over the last 40 years , I 've <unk> about <unk> hours <unk> , and 500 of these hours in <unk> .
And I learned that the <unk> of the ocean , even the <unk> ocean , even the very <unk> life that really goes beyond our imagination .
The imagination of nature is <unk> respect to our human imagination .
Again , I 'm <unk> by what I see when I <unk> <unk> .
And my story of love with the ocean <unk> , <unk> than it has ever been .
But when I <unk> a career , <unk> , I <unk> to make films .
We want to be the best way to <unk> this <unk> to tell stories with <unk> to create images .
And , as a kid , <unk> <unk> <unk> and so on .
So making films was the only way to put images together and stories .
Everything <unk> .
And of course the stories that I <unk> to tell were stories of <unk> : " <unk> , " <unk> " and " The <unk> . "
And with " The <unk> , " I <unk> my love for the <unk> and the <unk> with the <unk> of a movie .
So , I <unk> the two <unk> .
From " The <unk> " came out something interesting that was <unk> a <unk> problem in that movie , which is creating that kind of <unk> water <unk> with the computer .
And so it was born the first character to the surface <unk> and <unk> computers that had ever seen in a movie .
And even though the movie doesn 't make a lot of money , you know , I 've been <unk> of something extraordinary , the audience was <unk> by this <unk> <unk> .
You know , it 's the law of <unk> <unk> that every <unk> technology is <unk> by <unk> .
You 're looking at something <unk> .
And that <unk> me a lot .
And I thought , " <unk> , this is something that must be <unk> in the <unk> art . "
So , with " <unk> two , " my next movie , we went far beyond .
<unk> with the <unk> and <unk> , we created the guy of <unk> <unk> <unk> in that movie . <unk> <unk> as he would <unk> that effect .
And he 's <unk> . And we have again created a <unk> .
And we <unk> the same result with an audience .
But we <unk> a little bit more with that film .
So , we had a line of these two <unk> of experience , I came to the <unk> that this would be a whole new world , was a whole new world of creativity artists .
<unk> , I <unk> a society with <unk> <unk> , my favorite friend <unk> <unk> <unk> , which was the main <unk> and designer of creatures at that time , and we call it <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And the principle of society was <unk> to <unk> the past , the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> and so forth , and go directly to the digital production .
And so we 've made a <unk> <unk> for a while .
But we went back to half the ' <unk> in the part of <unk> of creatures and characters , which is what we had <unk> society .
So , I wrote this " <unk> " <unk> " with the <unk> of <unk> <unk> on the <unk> effects of <unk> , <unk> to the computer , with human <unk> , and all the major <unk> characters in the computer and the entire world <unk> to the computer .
And it was <unk> to the <unk> .
The <unk> of the society told me that they didn 't have been able to do it for a while .
So , I <unk> it , and I did this film of a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
I <unk> it up there as a " <unk> and <unk> on a <unk> . "
It would have been a <unk> story , a <unk> movie .
<unk> , what I wanted to do was <unk> to see the <unk> of the " <unk> . "
That 's why I 've done that movie .
And it 's the truth . They didn 't know .
But I <unk> them . I said , " We 're going to <unk> the <unk> .
I <unk> it for the beginning of the movie .
It 's very important . It 's a fantastic <unk> <unk> . "
And I <unk> them to <unk> a <unk> .
It looks <unk> . But this <unk> us back to the imagination that creates reality .
Because we really created a reality and six months later I <unk> on a <unk> <unk> to two miles and <unk> into the North <unk> , to look at the real <unk> from a <unk> , not in a movie , not in a movie , not in a movie , but it 's really <unk> .
I was <unk> <unk> .
And there 's a lot of <unk> , we had to build <unk> and <unk> and a lot of other things .
But I was <unk> by those <unk> <unk> , it was like a <unk> mission .
where everything was <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
I 'm going to show you in this <unk> , go down into this <unk> environment , where there are no <unk> to be <unk> , that you can 't go back .
And I thought , " <unk> . It 's like living in a <unk> movie .
It 's really great . "
And so , I 've been <unk> by the <unk> of the <unk> of the ocean .
Of course , the <unk> , the <unk> <unk> .
It was all . It was <unk> .
It was <unk> . It was imagination .
And it was a experience that <unk> couldn 't <unk> me .
Of course , I could imagine a <unk> and create a <unk> effect . But I couldn 't imagine what I was coming out of the <unk> .
In our <unk> <unk> , I 've seen creatures with <unk> <unk> and , sometimes , things that I had never seen before , that they were not even <unk> by science at the time when we <unk> it and imagine it was not even even <unk> by science at the time when we <unk> it and imagine .
So I was all about that , and I had to do more .
So I made a <unk> decision .
After the success of " <unk> , " I said , " OK , I 'm going to <unk> my work of <unk> <unk> , and I do the <unk> <unk> for a little bit . "
So we started <unk> these <unk> .
We <unk> to go to the <unk> and <unk> with <unk> <unk> .
We went to the <unk> of the <unk> .
We took little robots that we had created with <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> .
And the idea was to go inside and make a <unk> inside of the <unk> , which was never done .
<unk> had never <unk> within the <unk> . They didn 't have the <unk> to do it , so we created the technology to do it .
So here we go on the <unk> of the <unk> , <unk> in a <unk> , <unk> the <unk> that <unk> just like these , where I knew they had <unk> .
And I 'm <unk> a little <unk> <unk> through the <unk> of the <unk> .
When I say that , I 'm <unk> , but my mind is in <unk> .
It seemed to me to be <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk> .
And it was the <unk> <unk> experience that I 've ever lived , because before I <unk> the corner I knew what there would be behind , before the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , because I had the path for months <unk> the movie .
And the <unk> was <unk> on a <unk> <unk> of the <unk> model of the <unk> .
So it was an absolutely extraordinary experience .
And it really has <unk> me that in the experience of the <unk> that you can <unk> through these <unk> robots , the mind is <unk> in <unk> , in this other form of existence .
It was really profound .
And it could be a small <unk> of what might be <unk> in between some <unk> <unk> when you start having <unk> for <unk> or other reasons in some kind of <unk> future that I can imagine , from the <unk> of the <unk> .
So , we did these <unk> , and really started to <unk> what there was under , like the <unk> of the <unk> of the ocean where there were these <unk> animals .
<unk> , I 'm <unk> right here on the Earth .
We live in a <unk> environment .
We don 't go into a <unk> system on the light as we do .
So , you see animals that are close to <unk> water to 500 degrees <unk> .
It seems impossible to be <unk> .
On the same time , I was <unk> a lot of <unk> science , again , is the influence of the <unk> , as a kid .
And I ended up in the <unk> environment , really <unk> <unk> with NASA , <unk> in the <unk> <unk> of NASA , to <unk> <unk> <unk> , going to <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> , and all these things , to fly to the <unk> <unk> with our <unk> <unk> .
It was fascinating .
But what I 'm finished to do is to bring scientists <unk> with us in the <unk> .
And we 're going to put it down because we could have <unk> <unk> , <unk> scientists , people are <unk> to these <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> and so on .
So , we were <unk> of the <unk> , but actually <unk> science .
I had <unk> the <unk> between being <unk> of <unk> <unk> , as a kid , to do those things really .
And you know , in this path of discovery , I learned a lot .
I learned a lot about science . But I learned a lot about <unk> .
Everybody thinks a <unk> <unk> to be a leader , the <unk> of <unk> , or something like that .
I didn 't know any <unk> of <unk> before doing all those <unk> .
Because I had to say , " What am I doing out here ?
Why am I doing that ? What are you doing ? "
You don 't know anything to do all these <unk> .
We 're in <unk> . There 's no <unk> .
People think almost who thinks me I 've gone into the " <unk> " and " <unk> " and " <unk> " and " <unk> " and " <unk> " and " <unk> " and " <unk> " and " <unk> " . "
I 've made all of these films , all these <unk> for an audience so <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , no money . What am I doing ?
I 'm doing this for the task in itself , for the challenge -- and the ocean is the largest challenge that <unk> , for the <unk> of discovery , and that strange <unk> that <unk> when a little group of people form a <unk> <unk> team .
Because it <unk> with <unk> people , working together for years .
Sometimes in the sea for <unk> months of <unk> .
And in that <unk> , you realize that the important thing is that you have for them , and they have for you , when you <unk> a task that you can 't explain to any other .
When you get to the ground and <unk> : " We have to do this , and the <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> , and the <unk> of the technology , and the <unk> , the <unk> of human <unk> when you 're working on the <unk> , and the <unk> , the <unk> of the human <unk> when you 're working together , and they don 't <unk> .
<unk> a <unk> , creating a <unk> of respect .
When I went out to make my next film , which is " <unk> " I tried to <unk> the same principle of <unk> <unk> <unk> team and <unk> to <unk> their respect .
It 's really <unk> the <unk> .
And so I 'm going to <unk> again with a small group , in <unk> <unk> to do <unk> <unk> with new technologies that won 't happen before .
<unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> .
And we <unk> a family , in the <unk> of four and a half years .
And it completely changed my way to make films .
People have <unk> by saying that I took the organisms from the ocean , and I <unk> them on the planet .
For me , it was the <unk> of the way of doing business , the process , which had changed .
What can we do ?
What are the <unk> we learned ?
I think the first is <unk> .
It 's the most powerful thing we <unk> .
The imagination is a force that can actually <unk> a reality .
And the <unk> of the group is more important than all the <unk> in the world .
<unk> <unk> come to me and they say , " <unk> some <unk> <unk> to do this . "
And I said , " Don 't <unk> <unk> .
<unk> people <unk> it for you , you don 't <unk> on yourself .
And <unk> <unk> <unk> . "
NASA 's always saying this <unk> , " The <unk> is not <unk> . "
But the <unk> has to be an <unk> in art and <unk> , because it 's how to make a <unk> in <unk> .
And no important <unk> that <unk> innovation was done without <unk> .
You should be <unk> to <unk> these <unk> .
This is the thought that I want to talk to you about , that in whatever you want , the <unk> is a <unk> , but the fear no . Thank you .
If you 're going to show you today to understand one great idea would be the <unk> together of the data that <unk> is bigger than the <unk> of its parts , and that instead of thinking about information , I 'd like to show you how to use information information , <unk> .
Here you see <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> for age .
This device that I use is a small experiment .
It 's called <unk> , and with <unk> , I can choose one cause of death , let 's say <unk> .
And we see <unk> new relationships .
The reason is that here in the middle of the people here are more <unk> ; they 're more <unk> .
We can make a step back and <unk> the data for death , we see <unk> diseases and cancer are the major <unk> , but not everybody .
If we go on and <unk> for age , let 's see that <unk> are the cause of death that you 're going to be more .
It 's closer , it 's worth <unk> <unk> .
So you realize that <unk> information and data in this way is a little bit of <unk> information .
And if we can do it with <unk> data because we don 't do it with <unk> ?
For example , we have the <unk> of every <unk> <unk> ever <unk> .
Everything here .
You can see it in your <unk> and <unk> .
With <unk> you can look at a <unk> .
Or a year <unk> .
You can <unk> a <unk> number .
So let 's take the <unk> that <unk> in this number , their <unk> .
I 'm a <unk> <unk> <unk> , so I 'm <unk> here and I see all the numbers that I <unk> <unk> .
Now , if I want to <unk> a look , I could think , " Why don 't I look at all the <unk> ? "
<unk> a <unk> back and <unk> the <unk> .
And now I see <unk> <unk> .
You 're going to realize that when you 're <unk> between information in this way , or more <unk> going on and forth , it 's not just a research , it 's not just <unk> .
But you do something different .
It 's a way of the <unk> that we 're <unk> how to use information .
We still have this idea that may seem a little <unk> .
We took every single page of <unk> and <unk> it to a <unk> <unk> that <unk> in a small <unk> and a <unk> that <unk> the area .
I 'm going to show you the first 500 of the most <unk> <unk> on <unk> .
Even in this <unk> <unk> , we can do a lot .
They <unk> areas that are <unk> on <unk> .
At this point , he <unk> the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> this <unk> , we see that the most often <unk> <unk> to this voice is the " <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
This is <unk> because it 's doing something that in the <unk> <unk> pages wasn 't there .
And you can see it just a step back to see the together .
If I <unk> one of these <unk> , I can then go to the <unk> " <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> .
and <unk> everybody .
At this point I see that most <unk> <unk> by <unk> <unk> . Some of the science <unk> .
Here 's my head .
One comes from music .
And , rather interesting , <unk> has won a TED <unk> .
So we 're going to see all the <unk> of the TED <unk> .
For the first time we really <unk> into the network as if it was a network , not by a page , but to a <unk> level of <unk> .
I want to show you another thing that might happen to you .
This is the New York Times <unk> .
<unk> , this <unk> -- I don 't call the <unk> , because it 's not a <unk> , but it 's still needed to see pages -- we 're <unk> this technology for <unk> to every page , like this .
I can take a step back and go back to a <unk> <unk> . This is important because the only see the web so it makes me see all my <unk> in the same way .
I can <unk> on what I did at <unk> moments .
In fact , you can see the state of the <unk> I just <unk> .
I can be in a sense of other things that I 've seen in the day .
If I want to make a step back and see everything , I can <unk> my <unk> or the <unk> of my research .
Here we are <unk> <unk> , <unk> the <unk> engine , here to <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And from here , I can <unk> on my web and just <unk> from here .
A <unk> <unk> a lot of times , and in any case the <unk> is than the <unk> of the parts , of <unk> data .
<unk> , in the world , data is <unk> as a kind of <unk> .
It 's about <unk> information .
It 's about <unk> in the data .
And if we were all <unk> if we <unk> the web <unk> instead of <unk> from one thing to the other , we 're going to go through a lot of things to a lot of other things that are <unk> <unk> <unk> ?
And then instead of <unk> <unk> in the data we could really <unk> information .
Instead of <unk> just <unk> of information , we can <unk> out of knowledge .
And you know , maybe you get to the <unk> .
And with this <unk> you .
They all talk about happiness .
I asked to <unk> the number of books the word " happiness " in <unk> and <unk> in the last five years , have <unk> <unk> after <unk> , and there were many more .
There is a huge <unk> of interest in happiness , between <unk> .
There is a lot of <unk> about happiness .
Everybody <unk> to make the <unk> people .
But even though all of this <unk> of work , there are a series of " <unk> <unk> " that somehow make <unk> impossible <unk> ideas on happiness .
My talk about today is most <unk> these " <unk> <unk> . "
And it 's about <unk> people who think about their happiness , and it 's about <unk> that <unk> happiness , because it turns out that we are <unk> as all the other people .
The first of these <unk> is the <unk> to <unk> complexity .
In fact , that the word happiness is no longer a useful word in the <unk> <unk> .
I think that you can <unk> to a particular meaning , but in a line of <unk> , <unk> <unk> of this <unk> and <unk> <unk> the most <unk> vision of what the <unk> is .
The second <unk> is the <unk> between experience and memory , it 's basically about being happy in life and be happy of their life .
And these are two different <unk> , both of the concept of happiness .
And the third is the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> that we can 't think of any <unk> that we can 't think of any <unk> <unk> .
I mean , it 's a real <unk> <unk> .
and there 's no way to do the right thing .
I 'd like to start with an example of a person who , after a <unk> of questions and <unk> , after my lesson , <unk> a story .
[ <unk> ] <unk> ... ] <unk> that while <unk> a <unk> of <unk> music , right at the end of the <unk> , <unk> a <unk> sound .
And then <unk> , very <unk> <unk> , who had <unk> the whole experience .
But it wasn 't true .
What was <unk> was <unk> was the <unk> of the experience .
He had lived the experience .
And it was 20 minutes of the wonderful music .
but that 's not going to happen because he <unk> with a certain <unk> ; <unk> was <unk> , and I remember was all the <unk> .
What this <unk> tells us , at the bottom , is that we might think of ourselves and other people in terms of two " <unk> . "
There 's a <unk> that lives in the present and <unk> the present , and it 's capable of <unk> the past , but it 's capable of <unk> the past , but it 's only what the present .
It 's the " that it lives " and what the <unk> is going to be -- you know when the <unk> <unk> <unk> , " <unk> you know when you 're <unk> here ? "
And then there is the " that <unk> , " is the " that <unk> " that <unk> the points , " which <unk> the points , and they <unk> in the history of our life , and that 's the " to which the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> : " How are you heard in the last few days ? "
or something similar .
<unk> are two different <unk> , the <unk> that lives a experience and what if you <unk> , and <unk> between two is part of the <unk> on the <unk> of happiness .
The <unk> that <unk> , is a <unk> .
And this process starts with a fundamental answer of our <unk> -- it immediately .
We don 't tell stories just when we try to <unk> them .
Our memory tells us stories , <unk> , <unk> , what 's <unk> us is a story .
Let me start with an example .
It 's an old study .
It <unk> the experiences of two patients in a <unk> <unk> .
I didn 't go into it . It 's not even <unk> a day in today , but it was <unk> when this study was <unk> in the ' <unk> .
They <unk> patients to <unk> their pain every 60 seconds .
And here 's the results for two patients .
<unk> are their results .
If you ask , " Who is the two of the most ? "
It 's a very simple question .
<unk> , the <unk> <unk> has <unk> more .
his <unk> <unk> more and more .
But now , there 's another question : " How much these patients think they 're <unk> ? "
and here 's the <unk> : <unk> the <unk> . A had a <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> .
The stories of <unk> were <unk> that a particularly part of the <unk> is the way that they <unk> -- none of these stories is particularly <unk> -- but one of the two is particularly a different -- one of the two is particularly <unk> of the other .
And the <unk> is where the pain was <unk> at the time .
It 's a <unk> story .
How do I <unk> ?
Because we asked these people after the <unk> , and also a distance of time , " How much <unk> was the experience , everything <unk> ? "
and I 'm going to talk about it , in <unk> .
So this is a <unk> <unk> between the <unk> that lives the experiences that <unk> them .
<unk> view of the <unk> that lives the experience , it 's clear that <unk> has <unk> <unk> .
So , what you could do for A patient , and we have <unk> experiments , and it was really done , and it really was done , and it could <unk> the <unk> of <unk> .
This <unk> a little bit of pain in the patient , but just a little bit , and much less than before .
And by doing this for a couple of minutes , the <unk> that lives the experience of <unk> . At worse , and the <unk> that <unk> the experiences of <unk> . At much better than it is , because it 's now , it 's a better <unk> of his experience .
How do you <unk> a story ?
And that 's worth about the stories that are from the <unk> that we 're going to tell a story , are the changes the <unk> moments and <unk> .
<unk> are very , very important and , in this case , the final has <unk> .
So , the <unk> that lives the experiences lives in a <unk> way .
It 's <unk> when they 're living experiences . And you know , what happens to these moments ?
And the answer is simple .
I 'm <unk> always <unk> to say that most of our life -- as I <unk> them -- I mean , you know , I mean , the <unk> is <unk> about three seconds . That means that in a life , <unk> about <unk> million . In a month , we 're going to get about <unk> million . In a month , if we <unk> about <unk> million of them .
Most of them are completely <unk> by the <unk> .
And yet , somehow you have the feeling that it should be <unk> , that what happens in these moments of experience is our life .
It 's the <unk> resources we 're <unk> in this world .
And as a <unk> , <unk> <unk> , but it 's not the story that the <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> for us .
So we have a <unk> that <unk> and a <unk> that lives that are different experiences .
The biggest difference between the two is like <unk> time .
<unk> view of the <unk> that lives the experiences , if you were in <unk> , and the second week is fun as the first , then the <unk> of two weeks is better than the <unk> of a week .
But that 's not the way the <unk> works works .
For the <unk> that <unk> , a <unk> of two weeks is better than a week of <unk> , because there are no new <unk> in <unk> .
You don 't have the story .
And in that way , time is the <unk> <unk> that <unk> the <unk> that it 's going to be from the <unk> that lives .
<unk> has a <unk> impact on this story .
<unk> , the <unk> that <unk> the experiences more than <unk> and tell stories .
It 's actually the <unk> that it takes decisions because , if you <unk> a patient that has had , for example , two different <unk> and is <unk> , which he 's two different <unk> and is <unk> what he 's <unk> . " <unk> , " and that is going to be the medical <unk> .
The <unk> that lives the experiences doesn 't have voice in these choices .
In fact , we don 't <unk> between experiences , but between the <unk> of those experiences .
And even when we think about our future , we don 't think of our future as experiences .
<unk> to our future as a <unk> <unk> .
So , you can actually <unk> this situation , like a <unk> of the <unk> that <unk> , and you can think of the <unk> that it 's going to be the experiences that lives the experiences that it doesn 't need .
I have the feeling that when we go into <unk> , often the case that , you 're <unk> in the good service of our <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And this is a little hard to <unk> .
Well , how <unk> our <unk> ?
This is one of the <unk> that is <unk> for the <unk> of the <unk> that <unk> .
When I think about that , I 'm a <unk> in the <unk> of a few years ago , which is one of the best <unk> of my life , and that I think about often other <unk> .
And I probably spent the <unk> of that journey of three weeks , to say , 25 minutes in the last four years .
If I had ever open the <unk> with the photographs of the journey , I would have another time . This is three weeks of journey that <unk> into an hour and <unk> . It looks like that there 's a <unk> .
<unk> , I could be a little <unk> , in my favorite <unk> <unk> for <unk> <unk> , but even if you <unk> more of this , a <unk> question is <unk> .
Why do we take so much weight we take <unk> experiences ?
Now I want you to see an experiment with the thought .
Imagine that during the <unk> <unk> <unk> that at the end of the <unk> , all the photographs of the <unk> <unk> , and <unk> medicine for <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> the same <unk> ? And if you had to choose a different <unk> , you create a <unk> between the two <unk> , and you have to think about how to solve that <unk> and actually isn 't that <unk> because , if you think in terms of time of the time .
And if you think in terms of <unk> , you might get another answer .
That 's because it <unk> the <unk> that we do , is a problem that <unk> us in front of the two <unk> .
The two <unk> <unk> <unk> .
We are actually two <unk> of <unk> that we can use one for every <unk> .
So , you can ask : How happy is the <unk> that makes the experience ?
And then you can ask : How happy are the moments in the <unk> life that lives experience ?
And it 's a <unk> process .
What are the emotions that we measure ?
And , by the way , we are able to make us a good idea of <unk> happiness that lives the experiences in time .
If you know , the happiness of the <unk> <unk> , it 's a completely different thing .
It 's not how much a <unk> person .
It 's about how <unk> or <unk> is the person when she thinks about his life .
It 's a very different idea .
It 's not able to <unk> these two <unk> , is going to be able to <unk> these <unk> in the studies of happiness , and I <unk> to a group of <unk> students , who <unk> the studies on happiness for a long time in this way .
The difference between the <unk> happiness that lives the experiences and the <unk> of the <unk> that <unk> has been <unk> in the last few years , and there are now of <unk> to measure the two <unk> , the <unk> <unk> has a <unk> on the world where over half a million people have been <unk> to a <unk> on what they think about their life and their experiences .
And you 've been other studies of this direction .
So in the last years , we started <unk> on happiness of two <unk> .
And the greatest lesson we learned , is that they 're very different .
You want to know how much a person is <unk> with your life , and yet that doesn 't tell you how much <unk> your life and <unk> .
To give you an idea of the <unk> , the <unk> is about <unk> .
What does it mean that if you <unk> someone , and you say , " <unk> , his father is <unk> high <unk> , " how much of his <unk> ?
Well , let 's do something about his <unk> <unk> , but with a lot of <unk> .
<unk> always a little bit of <unk> .
If I tell you that somebody thinks his life is at eight of the scale of a <unk> <unk> <unk> about how happy they are with their <unk> that lives .
So <unk> is low .
We have a certain knowledge of what the <unk> of the happy <unk> .
We know that money is very important , <unk> are very important .
We know that being happy to be <unk> with people who are <unk> us , <unk> of time with people who are <unk> us .
There are <unk> other <unk> , but these are the main ones .
So if you want to <unk> happiness of two <unk> , you 're going to be doing very different things .
The <unk> of what I said is that we should not think about happiness as a <unk> <unk> .
It 's two completely different ideas .
<unk> , very , very quickly , another reason that we can 't think of <unk> ways of happiness is that we don 't pay attention to the same things when we think about life , and when we live life .
<unk> , if you ask the simple question about how happy people in California , you don 't have the <unk> answer .
When you ask this question , think that you should be <unk> in <unk> .
What happens is that when you think of life in California , you 're thinking about the <unk> between California and other places , and for example that <unk> is about climate .
<unk> , <unk> that the climate is not so important for the <unk> that lives the experiences that it 's not very important for the <unk> that <unk> is what you feel as happy are the people .
But <unk> the <unk> that <unk> is in <unk> , you could end -- some people could , at the end , <unk> in California .
And it 's interesting about what 's going to happen to the people who are <unk> in California to be <unk> .
<unk> , the <unk> that lives the <unk> <unk> .
We know it .
But a <unk> thing . I thought I would be <unk> , because when you think about it , it turns out to be <unk> .
And I thought we got the right decision .
It 's very hard to think of <unk> , and I think I gave the idea of how hard it is .
Thank you .
Chris Anderson : Thank you . I have a question for you .
Thank you very much .
When we were on the phone a couple of weeks ago , it <unk> me that a interesting result of the <unk> of <unk> .
Is it something that you think we 've still seen that we have a few minutes ?
<unk> <unk> : Yeah .
I think that the most interesting result that we found in the <unk> <unk> is a number , that we don 't have to find it .
We found that , with <unk> at the <unk> of the <unk> that lives experiences .
When we 've <unk> as the <unk> <unk> with the income , we found that , in the <unk> of a <unk> income per year for Americans , on a study very <unk> about a <unk> <unk> of about <unk> dollars a lot of about <unk> dollars a <unk> per year --
CA : <unk> <unk> : <unk> <unk> dollars a year , people are <unk> , and they become <unk> as <unk> as they become <unk> , they become <unk> , Al <unk> .
I mean , I 've seen the lines so <unk> .
<unk> , what happens is that the money doesn 't <unk> the happiness of the experience , but the <unk> of the money of certainly <unk> <unk> , and we can measure that <unk> very , very clearly .
In terms of the other <unk> , the <unk> that <unk> , is all another story .
More money , <unk> you 're <unk> .
This talk not about emotions .
CA : But <unk> , all the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> life , the <unk> , the <unk> of happiness .
If people are going to <unk> this discovery , basically <unk> everything that we 've <unk> , for example , politics on <unk> and so on .
<unk> the chance that <unk> , and the country in general , can take a discovery like that <unk> and bring forward a public policy on it ?
<unk> : I think it <unk> the role of happiness in public policy .
The <unk> <unk> is going to be <unk> in the United States is not <unk> , but in <unk> <unk> , it 's becoming reality , and other states .
People are starting to recognize that they should think about happiness when they think about public policy .
You <unk> a little bit and people will start <unk> if they want to study the experience of happiness or if they want to study the <unk> of life , so that we need to start this <unk> on the <unk> .
How you think about the <unk> , takes different <unk> of how you think , and <unk> on the <unk> that you think about the <unk> or the <unk> that makes the experiences .
This is all about politics , I think , in the ' <unk> .
In the United States , they 're doing <unk> to measure the experience of the population .
And that , I think , <unk> to be part by the next <unk> , maybe two , of the <unk> <unk> .
CA : <unk> , it seems to me that <unk> is going to be , or the <unk> <unk> to be , the most interesting policy to follow in the next few years .
Thank you very much for having invented the <unk> economy .
Thank you very much .
I 'm going to talk about energy and climate .
It may seem strange , because in my work at the <unk> <unk> me <unk> <unk> and <unk> , things that are <unk> and giving the world to help the two billion people who live better lives .
But climate and energy , actually , they 're extremely important for them , <unk> are more important for them for them than anyone in the world .
A climate change , for many years , <unk> of <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> , or too <unk> .
<unk> <unk> in ways that their environment simply can 't <unk> .
which leads to the <unk> . <unk> <unk> .
So the <unk> <unk> are going to be for their <unk> .
Even the cost of energy is , for them , important .
In fact , if you <unk> the price of one thing , to reduce poverty , it 's going to be able to <unk> poverty , it 's going to <unk> the energy .
The price of energy is <unk> over time .
And a <unk> civilization because of the <unk> of progress .
The <unk> revolution has <unk> that industrial .
And even in the <unk> century , we 've <unk> to a <unk> <unk> in the price of electricity , which <unk> why we have <unk> , <unk> , we can make <unk> materials and so many things .
In the <unk> world , so we 're about electricity in a <unk> situation .
But while the <unk> price , for example of half , we have to <unk> a new <unk> , the CO2 emissions .
CO2 is <unk> the planet , and its <unk> is very simple .
CO2 <unk> a temperature <unk> , which <unk> effects .
<unk> on climate and perhaps worse , even worse , <unk> effects , in the sense that natural <unk> can 't <unk> to these <unk> changes and <unk> .
The <unk> of how much it <unk> the temperature because of a CO2 <unk> , and as <unk> of the two things <unk> the other things that is going to happen , but not very much .
And there is certainly <unk> about how <unk> , they are going to be extremely <unk> , but they are going to be extremely <unk> .
Now , I often asked the best scientists : we really have to reduce <unk> emissions ?
We can 't just <unk> in half or a <unk> ?
And the answer is that , until we 're almost <unk> to zero , <unk> <unk> .
That 's a big challenge , so .
It 's not like to say , " You have to spend a <unk> <unk> <unk> under a <unk> <unk> . "
It 's not " <unk> <unk> a little bit . "
It 's about <unk> <unk> .
Now , we <unk> a lot of CO2 every year , over <unk> billion <unk> .
<unk> 20 <unk> .
For the <unk> of the poor countries , it 's less than a <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> media is about five <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And somehow , we have to make sure that we have to <unk> that <unk> <unk> .
<unk> are <unk> <unk> .
<unk> some changes this <unk> has changed this <unk> , so we have to go from the <unk> <unk> to zero .
This <unk> has four <unk> .
It 's a series of <unk> .
We have the <unk> on the left , the CO2 , which we need to be <unk> , and the <unk> on the right is the population , the services that in any person uses , the average energy <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> and we see how we can <unk> .
<unk> , one of these numbers must be almost <unk> .
It 's <unk> <unk> .
Let 's see a little bit .
The first <unk> is the population .
The world has today <unk> billion <unk> .
We <unk> to the <unk> billion .
If we make a good job with the new <unk> , the <unk> health , we can <unk> maybe 10 , 15 percent , but here is <unk> <unk> a 30 percent .
The second <unk> is the services we use .
which <unk> everything , the food that <unk> , the TV , the <unk> , the <unk> .
They 're <unk> things , and <unk> of poverty means <unk> these services for almost everyone in the world .
And it 's a <unk> thing that this <unk> number .
In the <unk> world , in the <unk> world , probably we could <unk> and use less , but on average , on average , every year , this number <unk> .
And so , <unk> , the amount of services <unk> <unk> will be more than <unk> .
This is a very simple example of service .
You 've got the <unk> in your house , to make the <unk> , but these guys no <unk> and <unk> their <unk> under the <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> of <unk> -- and , the energy for <unk> service -- here finally , there are good news .
This <unk> is not <unk> .
Thank you very much <unk> , new ways of <unk> , <unk> made , <unk> <unk> <unk> , for many services can <unk> energy .
In some services you can reduce 90 percent .
There are other services , like the <unk> , or the <unk> plane , where the <unk> <unk> are very , very <unk> .
So , <unk> , in the best of the energy <unk> from three to maybe six times .
But these first three <unk> <unk> emissions from <unk> to <unk> , in the best cases , maybe <unk> billion <unk> .
It 's not enough .
<unk> the <unk> <unk> , the key <unk> , the <unk> of CO2 <unk> for <unk> of energy .
The question is , can we <unk> to zero ?
If you <unk> , no <unk> .
If you 're natural gas , no .
We <unk> all the ways to produce today , <unk> electricity and nuclear , CO2 .
What we 're going to do on a global scale . So it 's a new system .
And we need <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> , I don 't mean something impossible .
<unk> is a <unk> . The <unk> computer is a <unk> .
The Internet , and its services , they 're a <unk> .
People here today have <unk> to the creation of a lot of <unk> .
We usually don 't usually have a <unk> , a <unk> within which we <unk> the <unk> .
<unk> , it 's <unk> , and something happens , something else doesn 't .
In this case , we have to drive at all speed , and make a very <unk> <unk> times .
I said , " How do this concept ?
Is there any natural example , some <unk> that <unk> the imagination of people ?
I <unk> a year ago , when I was <unk> of the <unk> , and people <unk> it fun .
I <unk> them <unk> of the fact that , in the world , there are people who are <unk> with <unk> .
This is my idea for energy .
And I decided that <unk> would have been this year my <unk> at the environment .
Here are <unk> <unk> .
I 'm <unk> that they 're not going to get out of the <unk> .
now , we can <unk> <unk> like this , but they 're not going to be <unk> .
We need solutions , one or so many of them are , <unk> on a large scale and very <unk> , and it 's <unk> in many <unk> , I think that only five <unk> important effects .
I <unk> the <unk> , the nuclear <unk> , nuclear <unk> .
I also want to give some <unk> , and if they can do more than I look like , but here I 'm interested in <unk> that you 're going to work on <unk> of these five , and they 're not going to be any <unk> , because they 're all very difficult challenges .
<unk> to the first <unk> of <unk> <unk> , <unk> or natural gas that is .
Here 's our task seems simple , but it 's not , and it 's not , and it 's <unk> the CO2 , after <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> somewhere , <unk> that <unk> us .
Now , there are <unk> technologies that <unk> 60 percent -- 80 percent of CO2 , but reach 100 percent is going to be very hard , and it will be very hard to agree on where we 're going to get all this CO2 .
The most <unk> question is still about the long time .
Who <unk> ?
Who <unk> something that is literally billions of times more <unk> than any other type of <unk> <unk> , like nuclear or anything else ?
It 's a huge <unk> .
So it 's a hard problem .
Another source would be nuclear .
But even nuclear <unk> three big problems .
<unk> , especially in the very <unk> countries , is high .
The issue of security <unk> , the <unk> <unk> that nothing can go , <unk> the <unk> is <unk> by human <unk> , and that the <unk> is not <unk> purpose .
And how do you <unk> the <unk> ?
<unk> the <unk> <unk> , <unk> are so many .
People need to be <unk> .
So there 's very difficult problems that you could solve , and what you should work .
<unk> three of the five <unk> I <unk> them .
They 're the ones that are often <unk> " <unk> . "
And actually , <unk> the great <unk> of not <unk> a <unk> , <unk> some <unk> .
The first is that the <unk> of <unk> energy with these technologies is <unk> <unk> to the <unk> of a central power .
It 's a lot of <unk> energy , and so many kilometers <unk> , of thousands of times more <unk> than a normal power .
And also these <unk> are <unk> .
The sun doesn 't <unk> all day , no <unk> every day , and even the wind <unk> .
<unk> , if you 're <unk> on these <unk> , you have to find a way of electric power power .
<unk> challenges us on the cost of costs .
And on the distribution .
For example , let 's say that this <unk> source is <unk> .
So , you don 't just need technology , but you also have to do the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And finally , the problem of <unk> .
In order to <unk> the size of the problem , I 've <unk> all the kinds of <unk> <unk> today , for cars , <unk> , <unk> , of any kind , I 've <unk> it with the amount of energy <unk> in the world , and I discovered that all the <unk> in the world , and I 've discovered that all the <unk> right now might be 10 minutes of that energy .
So we really need a big step , a <unk> of 100 times as an <unk> now in use .
That 's not impossible , but it 's not very simple .
This is already <unk> when the <unk> " <unk> " <unk> " <unk> " <unk> , " 20 or 30 percent of the <unk> energy .
If you <unk> those <unk> to 100 percent , you need a <unk> <unk> .
But how do you <unk> this way ? What 's the right approach ?
Is it a <unk> <unk> ? What could it solve the problem ?
A lot of companies , in hundreds , they have to work .
We need at least 100 people in each of these five <unk> .
Many of them , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , which is good .
And I think here , in the TED group , a lot of people already have been working in these <unk> .
Bill <unk> has different companies , among which a call that <unk> <unk> big technologies in the solar <unk> .
<unk> <unk> is <unk> in <unk> of companies that are doing great things and have interesting <unk> , and I 'm <unk> my <unk> to this .
<unk> <unk> and I are <unk> a company , which , you know , <unk> the <unk> of nuclear .
There are some <unk> <unk> in <unk> , nuclear <unk> , nuclear <unk> .
But from a nice bit of time , the sector is <unk> , that there are some good ideas around is not so surprising .
The idea of <unk> is that , instead of <unk> just <unk> part of the <unk> , the one percent of the <unk> available , we decided to <unk> the <unk> , the <unk> percent . It 's an <unk> idea , in a certain sense .
The truth is about it for a long time , but it 's never been <unk> <unk> if it would <unk> or not , just through the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> today you can make a <unk> and see that yes , with the <unk> materials , it looks like <unk> .
And <unk> <unk> is <unk> percent of the <unk> , the structure of <unk> <unk> .
They <unk> the <unk> , and they use it as <unk> as <unk> as well as <unk> as well as they were , a <unk> <unk> .
It <unk> the <unk> as the <unk> <unk> . It 's a kind of <unk> .
It 's like a <unk> <unk> <unk> . It 's called <unk> <unk> .
<unk> of view , the problem is <unk> .
Here 's a picture of a place in <unk> .
This is the <unk> , <unk> percent of the <unk> , which was <unk> the part of the time as <unk> , and so it 's called <unk> <unk> .
These " <unk> " <unk> " <unk> " energy for <unk> . "
And we <unk> the sea water , with an economic process , there would be enough for the rest of life on this planet .
So a lot of challenges we need , but that 's an example of hundreds and hundreds of ideas that we need to <unk> .
How should we measure our progress ?
What <unk> should be ?
<unk> the goal , and then <unk> the <unk> <unk> .
You 've heard a lot of people talking about a <unk> of 80 percent for <unk> , <unk> , it 's very important to <unk> .
20 percent is going to be produced by <unk> countries , and some agriculture .
At that point , we 'll have <unk> the <unk> and the production of the <unk> .
To get to 80 percent , so the <unk> countries , <unk> countries like China , they have to <unk> their own electric production .
The other question is : are we <unk> this technology emissions ?
We <unk> it basically in <unk> countries ?
We also <unk> <unk> ?
It 's a <unk> <unk> .
It 's a key <unk> of <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , what would you look like to be the <unk> of the <unk> ?
That should have the same two <unk> .
<unk> <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> to start getting <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , <unk> is going to be the amount of CO2 , and so the temperature .
But the <unk> in this matter , doing things that doesn 't <unk> big <unk> , has a <unk> weight , or <unk> <unk> <unk> , to the other , which is the speed of the new <unk> .
We have to <unk> these <unk> at all speed , and we can measure the speed from the number of companies , <unk> projects , <unk> of <unk> .
Many <unk> books have been <unk> about it .
The book of Al <unk> , " <unk> , " and that David <unk> , " <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . "
These books <unk> the problem , and they make a context in which they <unk> the <unk> of a <unk> <unk> .
Many things have to be <unk> .
So I have a wish .
A very <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> technology .
If you had to choose one wish for the next 50 years , between : to choose the <unk> of the country , the <unk> of a <unk> , which <unk> <unk> a lot , or to do this thing that is half the half and it doesn 't make it <unk> . It 's about about half .
That 's the biggest impact .
If this wish is not <unk> , the <unk> between those who thinks in the long term , among the United States and China , between the United States and China , between <unk> countries and <unk> <unk> , is going to be a lot of <unk> .
So what do we have to do ?
What am I <unk> you to take the <unk> and <unk> ?
You need a greater <unk> to research .
When countries get <unk> in places like <unk> , they 're not supposed to talk about CO2 .
They also <unk> the <unk> program , and I 'm going to tell you how much <unk> <unk> in these <unk> <unk> .
We need <unk> , <unk> on CO2 , the <unk> and the <unk> and <unk> , tools that <unk> the cost of <unk> .
We have to <unk> the message .
We have to make this more <unk> and <unk> , and it has to <unk> the choices of the government .
It 's a <unk> <unk> , but I think <unk> .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Chris Anderson : Thank you .
Thank you .
first of all , can you <unk> an idea of <unk> ?
Bill <unk> : <unk> the software , <unk> the <unk> , <unk> all of the great scientists , which we already have , it only <unk> of millions , and even when we 're going to <unk> the materials in a <unk> <unk> , to be <unk> that <unk> , <unk> only hundreds of millions .
The hard thing is to build the <unk> <unk> , find <unk> billion , the <unk> <unk> , the place that we built the first <unk> .
Once built the first , if it 's going to be the <unk> of <unk> , because the costs , the <unk> of <unk> energy , are completely different from nuclear power that we know today .
CA : So , if you 're good , this <unk> construction , well <unk> , of a <unk> <unk> full of nuclear <unk> , of this kind of <unk> <unk> .
Then the process starts from high and <unk> ?
<unk> : <unk> , today , are <unk> <unk> , many people , many <unk> that can 't work , <unk> <unk> , things that <unk> and <unk> --
That 's not good !
If the <unk> is very cheap and you can <unk> <unk> for 60 years , <unk> in and <unk> all of those complexity .
<unk> there , <unk> for <unk> years , and then <unk> .
CA : A nuclear <unk> that <unk> <unk> .
<unk> : Yeah . Well , the <unk> can leave there , then you can take them , <unk> into another <unk> and <unk> .
And we 're <unk> with the <unk> already , now we 're <unk> in <unk> or <unk> near the <unk> .
<unk> our first <unk> .
So what it was a problem of the <unk> <unk> is going to be the <unk> of our , and the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , as soon as this process is going to be reality .
CA : But when I went around the world of the potential of this technology , where most interest in its <unk> ?
<unk> : Well , there 's no place place in particular , and there are all these interesting rules of <unk> about everything that 's nuclear <unk> , so I 'm going to get a lot of interest .
Our <unk> was in <unk> , India , China .
I 've just met the <unk> for <unk> .
We 've talked about how this idea is <unk> to the current program .
They 're <unk> . <unk> and <unk> have done about the work in this field .
It 's a <unk> on something that 's been done .
It 's a <unk> <unk> , but it 's a quick kind of <unk> , which many countries have been built , so anyone who 's built a quick <unk> is a good <unk> .
CA : In your <unk> , what are the <unk> and the <unk> thing ?
<unk> : Well , for one of these projects at the scale , which doesn 't cost much , so we 're going to talk about 20 years to <unk> .
This is the <unk> that the <unk> <unk> <unk> to be <unk> .
<unk> , if it 's all right , that 's not <unk> <unk> , it could easily <unk> this goal .
And now there are , <unk> , <unk> of companies in the sector , that they <unk> , if their research works , if the <unk> for their <unk> <unk> will be <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
And it 's better if a lot of solutions will have happened , because at that point they 're <unk> to a set of solutions .
It 's necessary that at least a success .
CA : <unk> of <unk> , <unk> , this is the largest <unk> you <unk> ?
<unk> : A <unk> revolution is the most important thing .
It would have been <unk> without <unk> <unk> , but the <unk> make it so much more important .
In the nuclear <unk> , there are other <unk> .
We don 't know their work well like this , but one is nuclear <unk> , a different approach .
There 's a <unk> <unk> . I think it 's hard to do , but maybe they 're telling the same thing of us .
So , there are different , but the <unk> is that a <unk> of <unk> <unk> a million times more energy than a million times more energy than a <unk> <unk> , say , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , potential , in terms of fact on the environment and other , it 's about it .
CA : And if it doesn 't work , what do we do ?
<unk> 't we think about <unk> <unk> <unk> to try to keep the <unk> temperature <unk> ?
<unk> : If you <unk> in that situation , it 's a little bit like when you get too much , and you 're going to have a <unk> attack .
Where are we going ? You need to have a <unk> or something like that .
There 's a whole line of research on the <unk> <unk> , which are various <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> 20 years in which <unk> the action .
It 's like a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> we don 't need .
Some people say that you don 't even work on the <unk> because you could <unk> , you continue to eat because the <unk> <unk> .
I don 't think it 's a <unk> choice , view the <unk> of the problem , but now in the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , where events are <unk> , or the <unk> are going to be the case of the <unk> .
CA : If I had a <unk> or two of them from them , like <unk> <unk> who have <unk> ?
<unk> : Well , there are different kinds of <unk> and the ones that <unk> <unk> are very few .
Some people say there is a <unk> <unk> <unk> because of the <unk> that <unk> the effects of <unk> .
I 'm very , very few things that you can just say that there 's a <unk> on a million that 's going to be <unk> on a million . Here is the main problem to AIDS .
We have a <unk> now and I 'm going to <unk> the <unk> just a lot later .
And so , when you 're <unk> from a thousand <unk> , the idea of doing <unk> that it 's going to be <unk> after --
<unk> to <unk> not well <unk> .
In fact , the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> ; there 's people in the <unk> world that looks at the <unk> and says , OK , that 's not that bad .
The fact is that this <unk> should be <unk> to action .
But my dream is that , if we can <unk> <unk> , and <unk> the <unk> on CO2 , then the <unk> <unk> : OK , I don 't care if you don 't care about CO2 , almost <unk> <unk> that <unk> it , but it 's because it 's more economic technologies .
CA : That would that be your response to the <unk> of <unk> <unk> , that if you <unk> all your <unk> trying to solve the CO2 , your other <unk> , are going to be <unk> , and that <unk> of money , when there are better things to do ?
<unk> : Well , the <unk> <unk> <unk> --
We say that the <unk> should <unk> 10 billion more than <unk> now is not so <unk> .
It shouldn 't be <unk> resources to other <unk> .
The things that are going to take a lot of money , and here are <unk> to <unk> solutions .
It 's <unk> to me .
<unk> that you 're not <unk> the <unk> of <unk> , <unk> to the point where they <unk> very cheap , I think the <unk> <unk> <unk> in technologies that have the potential of <unk> <unk> costs .
If the <unk> was , " <unk> the <unk> energy , so that only the <unk> can <unk> , " all of the <unk> can be able to pay for the energy five times so without <unk> .
The <unk> would be for those two billion .
And <unk> has <unk> its <unk> .
<unk> now is , " Why don 't you have more than <unk> and <unk> ? "
For his <unk> again , he <unk> it into the <unk> , but he 's realized that it 's a pretty <unk> group , and so it 's <unk> the issue of <unk> and <unk> .
And it 's a question that I think is <unk> <unk> .
It 's <unk> as <unk> as <unk> as little as a research and development .
CA : Well , I think I 'm going to talk to the audience , saying that I hope to see your wish to become reality . Thank you .
<unk> : Thank you .
I 'd like to share with you a discovery that I did a few months ago when I was <unk> an article for the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
I always <unk> my <unk> of the <unk> <unk> every time I <unk> something , but I had finished <unk> the article , and I realized that I 've never been in my life looking for the word " <unk> " <unk> " to see what I was going to find .
Let me show you the result .
" <unk> , " <unk> : <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
<unk> : In form , strong , <unk> .
<unk> <unk> this list of <unk> , and a friend and at the beginning , it was so <unk> , but as I <unk> the word <unk> my voice <unk> , and I had to <unk> it out of <unk> and the impact that the <unk> of these words have left me .
You know , we 're talking about my old <unk> of <unk> .
I 'm thinking , it 's going to be an old <unk> , right .
But , in fact , the <unk> of <unk> was early <unk> .
when I was <unk> schools , and I was <unk> and <unk> what I was <unk> out of my family and stuff <unk> to other children and the world around me .
and , <unk> <unk> , thank God , I wasn 't using the <unk> of <unk> at that time .
I mean , by this <unk> seems that they are <unk> in a world who see someone like me as one that has nothing <unk> <unk> in the way to them , when , in fact , they 're <unk> for the opportunity and <unk> that my life has <unk> .
So , I immediately went to see on the <unk> <unk> in the network , I decided to find a <unk> without value .
This is the <unk> version of <unk> .
<unk> , it 's not much better .
I find the <unk> two words under " almost <unk> <unk> , " " " The " and " <unk> . " So it 's not just <unk> the words .
is what we believe about people when they <unk> them .
It 's about the values behind these words , and how we <unk> these values .
Our <unk> language to think and our influence of the world and we see other people .
In fact , a lot of <unk> <unk> , and that <unk> <unk> , <unk> that <unk> <unk> was more powerful , because to say <unk> things at high voice on existence .
So , what we really want to bring to <unk> , a person who is <unk> , or a person with greater force ?
So , we 're going to do something simple as a person , a child , we could <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> on their <unk> .
They don 't have any <unk> <unk> for them ?
So one person , who opened me <unk> , was the <unk> of <unk> , I was a young girl . <unk> <unk> in <unk> , <unk> .
His name is <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> , whose name , <unk> , was too difficult to <unk> for most of the Americans , so he became <unk> .
And the <unk> <unk> <unk> always <unk> and had a <unk> <unk> to work with children .
I was almost anything about the time that I spent in the hospital , with the <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
I had to do what <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> with these <unk> <unk> <unk> , in different colors , you know , to build the legs .
And I <unk> these <unk> more than everything .
I <unk> them , I <unk> them , really <unk> .
And , you know , I knew already as a five years , with the <unk> <unk> <unk> to try to <unk> from these <unk> , <unk> , clear .
And , one day , came to one of my favorite <unk> and <unk> , these <unk> .
And he said , " <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , you 're a little girl so strong , I think you 're going to <unk> one of those <unk> .
" When you <unk> , you get 100 dollars . "
Now , of course it was just a little <unk> of the <unk> <unk> to <unk> that I didn 't want to do in front perspective of the perspective of being the <unk> girl , but , what actually did is , was to give a different form to a different <unk> <unk> .
and <unk> in a interesting experience for me .
And I 'm <unk> today , the <unk> of his vision , and his <unk> about me as a strong girl , <unk> my vision of myself in a strong , <unk> and <unk> person to the future .
This is an example of how adults with <unk> of power can <unk> the <unk> of a child .
But , in the example of before with the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> , our language is not from the chance of <unk> to the reality that everybody <unk> , the possibility of a <unk> of seeing if you as a <unk> .
Our language , has not been <unk> with the changes of our society , many of which have been <unk> by <unk> .
And of course , from a doctor 's <unk> , my legs , the <unk> to the <unk> for <unk> , <unk> of <unk> and also <unk> to <unk> that are <unk> people to <unk> with their ability , and move beyond the ability that nature has <unk> , without <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> of the network , people to <unk> their own <unk> of their <unk> , and they can <unk> their own <unk> of their own <unk> to their own <unk> of their own <unk> , so they can <unk> .
So maybe the <unk> <unk> technology now more clearly what was always a truth , that everybody has something <unk> and <unk> by <unk> to our society , and the human ability to <unk> is our greatest quality .
The human ability to <unk> , is something interesting , because people always wanted to <unk> <unk> <unk> , and I have to tell you that .
This <unk> never <unk> me , and I 've always been <unk> in <unk> to <unk> people about this , and I think I 'm <unk> to understand why .
It 's <unk> in this <unk> , <unk> <unk> , is the idea that success , or happiness , is <unk> on the other side of a challenge without <unk> or <unk> of this experience , if my success in life , is to come from a ability is to <unk> or <unk> the <unk> <unk> of a life with <unk> , or what people like my <unk> .
But , in fact , we 're <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , by a challenge , <unk> or <unk> or both .
And I <unk> <unk> that 's a good thing .
<unk> is not a <unk> that we need to <unk> our life .
it 's part of our life .
And I began to think that 's like my <unk> .
<unk> times the <unk> would do it a lot , and almost nothing , but it 's always with me .
And , of course , of course , you 're not going to <unk> the weight of a person .
There are the <unk> and the challenges in life , and it 's true to every single person , but the question is not if you want to <unk> or not , but like <unk> to do it .
So , our responsibility is not just to <unk> people to us by the <unk> , but it 's <unk> in the right way .
And we make a damage to our kids , when we make them feel that they 're not <unk> .
There 's a important difference and <unk> between the <unk> <unk> <unk> of being a <unk> person and the <unk> <unk> of the society that <unk> me or not .
And , actually , the only <unk> <unk> I had to deal with is if the world has ever thought I could be <unk> by those words .
In our <unk> to <unk> those who <unk> <unk> a <unk> , <unk> truth on their <unk> <unk> , or really , the <unk> of their life , we have to be <unk> to not put the first <unk> in a wall that you could <unk> somebody .
Maybe the <unk> model of looking just at what there is <unk> in you and how to place , it can <unk> more the <unk> that the disease .
In not <unk> a person in the <unk> , you don 't want to understand his <unk> , and we 're creating another <unk> disease of the natural <unk> that already have .
We 're actually <unk> a <unk> to the value of a person in our community .
So we have to see through the disease and inside the <unk> of human <unk> .
and , much more important , there is a relationship between those <unk> <unk> and <unk> creativity .
So , it 's not about <unk> , or <unk> , these <unk> research as something that we want to <unk> or <unk> below the <unk> , but rather to find those <unk> opportunities in a <unk> .
So maybe the idea that I want to explain to you is that there 's not what a <unk> <unk> , as <unk> to it , <unk> <unk> , to use a term of the <unk> <unk> , maybe even <unk> together .
And , maybe , if we look at a <unk> as a natural thing , we 're <unk> with that <unk> .
<unk> year , the <unk> <unk> of Charles <unk> <unk> , and it was <unk> years ago , when I was talking about evolution , which <unk> has <unk> , I think , the truth of the human <unk> .
To <unk> it in another way , it 's not the <unk> <unk> , and it 's not even the <unk> <unk> , is the <unk> that 's the most smart to change .
<unk> is the <unk> of <unk> .
<unk> work with <unk> , among other things , we can recognize that the human ability to survive and <unk> is <unk> by the human spirit of <unk> through the <unk> in <unk> .
So again , <unk> , <unk> , is our greatest quality .
And , maybe , we 're not <unk> to evidence , we don 't know what we 're made .
Maybe that 's what the <unk> gives us , a sense of <unk> , a sense of <unk> .
So , we can make a <unk> .
we can , <unk> the <unk> as something more than a difficult time .
Maybe we can see it as a <unk> .
The <unk> is a <unk> that we 're not <unk> yet .
I think the greatest <unk> that we 've <unk> is this idea of <unk> . Now , who is normal ?
There is no normal . There 's a common <unk> , there 's a <unk> . There 's no normal .
And <unk> <unk> those <unk> <unk> people <unk> if you <unk> ?
I don 't think that .
If you <unk> this <unk> from one of how to get the <unk> to one of how to get the possibility , or <unk> , to be <unk> a little bit more <unk> , we can understand the power of so many children , <unk> to the community .
<unk> <unk> us that what we , as humans , we 've wanted for the members of our community is to be of help , to <unk> .
There is a <unk> that in <unk> , 60 <unk> years ago , <unk> at the <unk> and the <unk> with <unk> <unk> , and , maybe by the experience of these people was the value of the value of the community : not <unk> this people like <unk> or <unk> ; they were <unk> as <unk> and value .
A few years ago , I was in a <unk> market , where I came across the <unk> <unk> of <unk> .
and I was <unk> in front of a <unk> <unk> .
It was summer and I had <unk> <unk> <unk> .
I heard this guy , his voice behind me , " but , it 's not <unk> <unk> . " And I was <unk> , and there 's this <unk> man of <unk> . I didn 't have any idea who was .
And I said , " <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> ? I didn 't remember <unk> me ever <unk> . " He said , " But , " he didn 't <unk> you met you met with <unk> .
I mean , when we <unk> , I was making you <unk> from the <unk> of your mother . "
Oh , that guy .
And , but of course , of course , I <unk> a <unk> .
That <unk> was the <unk> <unk> , a man that I had known by the stories of my mother on that day , because of course , <unk> , I went to <unk> two weeks .
And so , the <unk> <unk> of my mother had gone in <unk> , so the man that <unk> me was a <unk> <unk> for my parents .
And , I was <unk> without the <unk> , and I had the <unk> <unk> , some <unk> in this foot , and some of the one , he had to be the <unk> , this <unk> had to <unk> the <unk> .
He said , " I had to give this <unk> to your parents that you never <unk> , and that you never had the kind of <unk> that the other children or no <unk> life , and no <unk> life , and you 've given me of the <unk> since then , " <unk> <unk> <unk> . The extraordinary thing is that he told me that in the entire school <unk> of my <unk> , who had won the entire school --
I had <unk> with the <unk> <unk> , you know , the <unk> <unk> , which I 'd won my <unk> <unk> , or all my <unk> <unk> , and <unk> them , <unk> , <unk> to the students of his course , medicine of medicine and <unk> .
And he called this part of the course , the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> can be <unk> as much as <unk> can be and how <unk> it can be in the quality of a person 's life .
And the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> and said , " In my experience , unless you 're told , and even though it 's <unk> a <unk> of <unk> , if it 's only <unk> to itself , a kid comes up . "
So you see , the <unk> <unk> changed his <unk> .
He realized that there is a difference between a <unk> <unk> and what everybody can do with it .
And there was a change in my thinking in the years , in this , if you asked me when I was 15 years old , if I had <unk> <unk> with legs in meat and <unk> , I wouldn 't have <unk> a second .
<unk> that kind of <unk> at the time .
If I <unk> it today , they 're not <unk> .
And it 's because of the experiences that I 've had with them , not <unk> of the experiences I 've had with them .
and maybe , the change in me , because I 've been <unk> to the most people who opened me me the door of the ones that <unk> me .
You know , all you need is a person who <unk> the <unk> of your <unk> , and you 're <unk> . If you can give somebody the <unk> of their <unk> , the human spirit is so <unk> <unk> , if you can give someone the <unk> of their <unk> , you 're <unk> in the best ways .
You 're <unk> to <unk> their <unk> .
In fact , the <unk> meaning of the <unk> word comes from the <unk> " <unk> " that means , <unk> out what within , to bring the potential .
So again , what is the potential that we want to <unk> out ?
There was a case in the ' <unk> in the ' <unk> <unk> , when they were <unk> by schools .
It 's called the <unk> evidence here in <unk> .
That means <unk> students <unk> from their <unk> .
And the students with the best <unk> , they 've got a <unk> program , and better teachers , <unk> well , they 've been doing it for a time for three months , <unk> students with <unk> <unk> , they were smart .
And at the end of this period of three months , they were <unk> of the results at the level of <unk> . And , of course , the <unk> <unk> of this study , and they took of students from " <unk> <unk> , " they said , " <unk> . " And , that 's what happened at the end of three months .
I was <unk> in school , beyond the ones I had left .
The <unk> part of this study was that the teachers were <unk> .
The teachers didn 't know it was done this change .
They were just said : These are the students from <unk> and these are the ones with <unk> .
And that 's how they started <unk> .
So I think the real <unk> is to have a <unk> spirit , and a <unk> spirit has no hope .
He doesn 't see the beauty .
It has no longer our natural , <unk> <unk> and our <unk> ability to imagine .
If , we can support the human spirit to keep hope , to see the human spirit to keep hope , to see the beauty in themselves and other , to be <unk> and <unk> , <unk> that we 're using our <unk> force .
When the spirit has these quality , we can create new reality and new ways of being .
And I 'd like to leave you with a <unk> <unk> from a <unk> <unk> called <unk> who made me know my friend <unk> <unk> <unk> .
and the <unk> is called " The <unk> that <unk> only four words " " Every child has met God , not the God of the <unk> , not the <unk> of <unk> , but the God only <unk> four words and <unk> to <unk> , saying , " <unk> <unk> with me . "
Thank you .
