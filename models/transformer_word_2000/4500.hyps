The year I showed these <unk> for <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> , which is about three million years had the <unk> , which is about three million years had the <unk> of 40 percent .
So we have this <unk> <unk> of the problem because it 's not <unk> the ice .
<unk> <unk> <unk> is , in a certain sense , the heart of climate system .
It 's <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
The next <unk> will be a <unk> <unk> on the last 25 years .
<unk> <unk> <unk> .
So you see , you get <unk> up to the blue blue <unk> .
That 's the ice in <unk> , which is <unk> in the summer .
You can see that the ice <unk> <unk> , of five years , it 's like <unk> , which here <unk> from the body .
In 25 years , it 's <unk> , so .
This is a problem because the <unk> are <unk> in the ocean <unk> around the ocean <unk> where there are enormous amount of <unk> that , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
We <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , that amount of global <unk> , that <unk> , <unk> this point of not <unk> .
And in some <unk> <unk> <unk> is already <unk> <unk> , it 's already <unk> from water .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> ! <unk> : <unk> : <unk> . <unk> : <unk> question is <unk> .
A reason is that this <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> from the <unk> .
This is a <unk> <unk> .
<unk> had never <unk> <unk> .
This is the <unk> <unk> .
If you want to know how the level of the sea <unk> on <unk> , <unk> , here is where the sea .
These are <unk> <unk> .
<unk> other than the planet : <unk> , the largest <unk> of the planet .
The month , the <unk> <unk> that the <unk> of the ice is in <unk> , and that <unk> <unk> <unk> , is particularly <unk> in <unk> .
<unk> <unk> feet of the <unk> , like <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , the most big <unk> of ice , you see new <unk> , which few years ago were <unk> .
<unk> percent of the world 's population <unk> <unk> from the <unk> .
<unk> <unk> : This is the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> of this city .
<unk> is <unk> .
But when we <unk> , the same happens to the water .
In California , in California <unk> <unk> is <unk> percent of the <unk> .
<unk> <unk> are in the crisis .
<unk> , like you 're <unk> .
<unk> <unk> in the world <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> are <unk> out of the normal <unk> and without <unk> .
They 're going to be <unk> in the last 30 years of the <unk> <unk> .
This is a <unk> of all <unk> .
If you look at the <unk> , you can see the <unk> .
In the last five years we 've got <unk> <unk> of CO2 every 24 hours -- 25 million <unk> in the ocean every day .
Look at the <unk> <unk> , from <unk> , <unk> , and on the <unk> , and both the parts of the <unk> <unk> , where there 's a <unk> <unk> of oxygen in the ocean .
The <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , which is 20 percent , which is the use of <unk> .
The oil is a problem , and the <unk> is even even even even even even .
The United States are one of the two countries with the <unk> , together .
And they 're <unk> to build a lot of other <unk> .
But we 're <unk> to a <unk> of direction .
These are the <unk> <unk> in the last years and some <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And so , there 's a <unk> politics in our country .
<unk> <unk> <unk> , which is <unk> <unk> million dollars in the last year to <unk> <unk> <unk> , which is a <unk> .
I 'm going to <unk> something --
<unk> <unk> , where I live , where live , there was a <unk> <unk> billion <unk> <unk> .
Maybe you 've seen the <unk> .
This is the second <unk> in America .
It 's happened around <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> was this .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> <unk> is a <unk> , and happy .
It 's <unk> here in America , and it 's going to grow our economy .
<unk> the <unk> is more <unk> .
It 's <unk> price <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> here is a lot of the <unk> <unk> .
The largest <unk> society on the <unk> is <unk> . This is <unk> . This is his <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> -- <unk> <unk> -- <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> -- not know what they 're talking about .
<unk> <unk> : So the <unk> for the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
This is a part of them , a part .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> <unk> , we see the <unk> changes as a <unk> <unk> to our business .
So , this is <unk> a big amount of money in a <unk> <unk> to make public and <unk> the truth on the <unk> .
In fact , it 's not <unk> .
We think it 's <unk> -- it 's also a good <unk> .
So we don 't know about climate change .
We 're going to do it .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> -- you 've heard about a lot of <unk> .
So I 'm going to <unk> a structure of the <unk> for how it 's <unk> .
<unk> ! The machines are a little <unk> , but this is the sound of the <unk> technology .
<unk> <unk> <unk> that 's the <unk> <unk> of global <unk> , but the technology technology of <unk> that you see everything .
I look at a look at this is , <unk> technology .
<unk> <unk> : <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to the economic <unk> , and that the national <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> : <unk> is in the crisis ; the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> crisis .
The <unk> that <unk> all : our <unk> <unk> <unk> , like the <unk> <unk> , like the <unk> <unk> and oil <unk> .
But , there 's a new <unk> , <unk> solution for <unk> .
<unk> America : 100 percent of energy , in 10 years .
A <unk> for <unk> America to work , <unk> more <unk> , and help help <unk> the global <unk> .
<unk> , a solution that we 're going to solve our problems .
<unk> America . <unk> .
<unk> <unk> : This is the last <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> . It 's about <unk> energy to America .
One of the most <unk> <unk> that we <unk> to the <unk> <unk> that we <unk> our planet .
<unk> : The future is here . <unk> , <unk> , a new network network .
<unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> America . It 's time to be <unk> .
<unk> <unk> : A old <unk> <unk> says , " If you want to go , you go from them .
If you want to go back , you go . "
We have to go back , quickly .
Thank you very much .
<unk> year I <unk> <unk> .
And we 're going to <unk> on how it works works .
So we 've been <unk> . And for the those that the other time , there were no <unk> , the <unk> is the largest <unk> experiment .
<unk> is <unk> <unk> that they were in the <unk> that were in less than a <unk> of the beginning of the universe -- until we go to millions of times at <unk> .
All that 's just <unk> .
This is the car <unk> .
So we have these <unk> <unk> .
This is what I work . It 's called <unk> -- it 's <unk> feet and it has a <unk> <unk> feet .
This is an <unk> image of <unk> in building so you can see the <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> of the last year we 've <unk> the car for the first time .
And this picture was <unk> <unk> .
It was because of <unk> <unk> in control .
It 's an image of the first <unk> of <unk> <unk> that had all the <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , with a part of <unk> , and <unk> particles in the <unk> .
In other words , when we <unk> that image the <unk> <unk> , <unk> that the <unk> machine , the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> that 's a great <unk> .
I don 't know if it was this <unk> of the more or that , when somebody on Google and <unk> the page page was this .
What means we had a <unk> impact on that .
And I was a week after there was a problem with the car , just just <unk> here -- these <unk> <unk> .
These <unk> <unk> <unk> when the car works at the <unk> .
Now , the <unk> of you <unk> <unk> and <unk> , " It 's not true . It 's not true . It 's too <unk> . "
And they can do that because they 're very <unk> <unk> <unk> .
So , at least <unk> degrees , at a temperature <unk> to that of the space between stars , these <unk> can get that <unk> .
And in one of the <unk> of <unk> <unk> in <unk> , there was a <unk> <unk> .
So the <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
This was the result .
Now , this is more <unk> <unk> if you think that these <unk> <unk> more than 20 <unk> , and that you 're <unk> about 30 <unk> .
They 're <unk> about 50 <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , what we did .
We 've got them <unk> and <unk> .
Now , they 're all <unk> in their place .
I <unk> the end of <unk> <unk> will be <unk> .
We <unk> it , and we get to get the data to <unk> or <unk> , and we go so our <unk> to figure out what the universe are the universe .
Now , of course , in a certain way , these <unk> <unk> the <unk> of science and <unk> of <unk> science and <unk> of <unk> . It 's easy to <unk> .
I think the fact that it 's so hard , the fact of the <unk> , I think that 's the value of things like <unk> .
I 'd like to <unk> the words of a <unk> <unk> , which , <unk> <unk> , which <unk> , in <unk> <unk> experiments , his <unk> <unk> , his <unk> was <unk> , he said , " No , " No , it 's <unk> for the human <unk> of human mind that ideas , that they are not <unk> , that there are not <unk> ,
Thank you .
I want to start <unk> at when , children , <unk> <unk> with <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , <unk> , actually , actually think about <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> is <unk> to the way that <unk> <unk> in the way that <unk> .
So , from <unk> <unk> <unk> of our <unk> <unk> with <unk> objects , and I was <unk> <unk> , and my <unk> <unk> , and my <unk> <unk> , I started <unk> , I started <unk> , " If we use a computer , instead of <unk> how we 're <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> , with the <unk> <unk> , with the <unk> <unk> <unk> ,
and we 're going to <unk> ?
The question was so interesting that we 're going to try to explore the <unk> .
In a few words , a <unk> is a computer <unk> , like a <unk> .
In a few words , a <unk> is a computer <unk> , like a <unk> .
You can <unk> with the hand , you can say , " <unk> " between them , I feel the movement and a screen and a screen .
But <unk> , they 're <unk> , like <unk> , you can just <unk> .
<unk> are the example of a new <unk> of tools for <unk> information .
And I <unk> as a <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , the other , of the other , and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , of the other , like <unk> , we can explore and <unk> <unk> .
I 'm going to be <unk> .
This <unk> is <unk> to show the video : if you 're going to <unk> in a direction , the video <unk> , that if we 're going to go back .
These <unk> <unk> are <unk> .
If you <unk> them , you get them to what it 's going to .
If they <unk> , you can <unk> it and they can <unk> a little bit .
If they <unk> , you can <unk> it and they can <unk> a little bit .
They also <unk> their movement and <unk> .
We 've got to <unk> that one of the interesting <unk> of the <unk> was the <unk> data , to example , to example , " <unk> a color like if it was a <unk> .
In this case , we have three <unk> <unk> like <unk> , and I can <unk> for <unk> , and I can <unk> for <unk> .
And I can <unk> for <unk> color in the <unk> , where you get <unk> .
If you can <unk> it . We can <unk> a little place .
I 'm also <unk> <unk> , like <unk> , like <unk> , the mathematics and <unk> , the mathematics of <unk> where people can do things , and <unk> the results .
Now I 'm --
This is a <unk> <unk> that I do with a program .
Here we have a <unk> game that 's <unk> in <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> , at every <unk> <unk> a letter to every <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , every <unk> <unk> , <unk> a letter to every <unk> , and as <unk> of <unk> , and as <unk> <unk> .
Then , about 30 seconds , you get <unk> , and you have a new <unk> and new <unk> , and new <unk> to try .
Thank you .
Here 's the <unk> <unk> , I 've got a <unk> <unk> , I 've got a way that <unk> them and <unk> a video .
They 're <unk> .
And one of the interesting things of this <unk> is that you have to be <unk> people .
They just say , " <unk> <unk> , " and they know what do .
Here 's the other people who <unk> .
This is our <unk> <unk> , and the right there .
It wanted to be <unk> .
They were just <unk> , for him .
Now , this is an <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> .
It can <unk> <unk> their <unk> , <unk> their <unk> .
It can <unk> <unk> their <unk> , <unk> their <unk> .
So that 's doing the sun .
<unk> : The <unk> is <unk> .
David <unk> : Now he <unk> a <unk> in the <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> .
<unk> ! <unk> !
So we <unk> <unk> and <unk> can make the <unk> ,
<unk> : <unk> !
I 'm going to <unk> your story .
<unk> : <unk> !
<unk> : It 's a story with the final story , and you can decide it .
<unk> : It 's a story with the final story , and you can decide it .
<unk> : <unk> .
<unk> : The last example I 've got the time to show you is a <unk> , <unk> and <unk> music .
is a <unk> , <unk> <unk> and <unk> music .
<unk> here , <unk> <unk> like the bottom , and the <unk> .
And you know , you can have four <unk> , and you can have to <unk> that .
You can also <unk> these <unk> in a <unk> <unk> .
And I just 'm doing <unk> a sound , " and a <unk> . "
These are actually <unk> that you can control from the <unk> , like <unk> and <unk> .
We 're going to be a particular sound and then <unk> for <unk> .
And then there are the <unk> like time and <unk> , which <unk> , you get <unk> to the whole <unk> .
I 'm going to be <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> a <unk> in two <unk> <unk> , " <unk> , <unk> in a series , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> other <unk> .
Now , you 're going to go to the bottom .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> . Now <unk> <unk> --
<unk> : <unk> <unk> , so I can <unk> the <unk> , so I can control the effect .
<unk> : <unk> : I can <unk> the whole <unk> <unk> <unk> the whole time from one side or other .
<unk> : <unk> the <unk> to <unk> the bottom for to give more <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> . I can <unk> the <unk> . "
So I don 't have to <unk> before , but I can <unk> , <unk> , more <unk> .
And now , I can <unk> the whole <unk> <unk> <unk> on the left <unk> <unk> . "
Thank you .
So , you can see , my passion is to build new <unk> <unk> <unk> more <unk> as our brain and body .
And today , I 've had time to show you one of the <unk> of this <unk> , and some <unk> that we 're going to get out from the lab .
So the idea I want to <unk> is that 's <unk> this new generation of <unk> <unk> to <unk> the media , that we want to do .
Thank you very much .
I don 't see the <unk> of all of you .
I 'm a <unk> .
I 'm going to go to the <unk> , but it 's more than this ,
It 's also the love of my life .
And I don 't like that that can change .
But , said , this , something particular is <unk> in my my career and in my career , who <unk> me to <unk> the whole whole relationship with this work .
The particular thing is that I <unk> <unk> this book , this <unk> called <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , for some reason reason , and a big , <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And the result is that it <unk> now , people like I <unk> , you know , I was <unk> .
<unk> -- <unk> , <unk> !
I 'm going to be <unk> and say , " You don 't think , " You don 't think more than you have ?
You don 't think you 're going to write all the life without more able to create a book that can <unk> to somebody ? "
What can you get to somebody ? "
It 's <unk> , you know .
But it could go . I 'm going to be <unk> , and I 'm going to say , I was a <unk> -- I was a <unk> -- I was a <unk> -- I wanted to be a <unk> .
I 'm going to be <unk> from the <unk> .
And people said , " Don 't <unk> to do not to be <unk> ?
You don 't think the <unk> <unk> you ?
You don 't think that <unk> for all the life without anything else else is going to be out and <unk> to die on a <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> ? "
So you know .
The answer is -- the short answer to all these questions is , "
So , I think of all those things .
I 've been <unk> .
And I think that people don 't think people don 't <unk> .
So , you know , you know , you know ,
But , for how do I thought , what I thought and <unk> is why ?
Is it <unk> ?
It 's <unk> that anybody <unk> to be <unk> from a job that you feel <unk> .
But what 's so particular , in <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in a way that other <unk> <unk> , in a way that other <unk> don 't ?
So , my father , for example , he was a <unk> <unk> , and I 'm not <unk> of one time in his 40 years of <unk> , which he said , if I think that he said , "
And it was not -- that <unk> of the <unk> John <unk> , how do it ?
<unk> 't you so , <unk> ?
<unk> , <unk> <unk> as a group of course , in <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
We have <unk> , we have this <unk> , and not just <unk> , but we have this <unk> of all these <unk> , we have this <unk> <unk> .
And we don 't want to look at the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> that , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> young and often often for them .
And also those who don 't seem to be <unk> from their <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , before in <unk> <unk> said , " Every <unk> <unk> said , " Every book <unk> me a little bit more <unk> about the work of their life .
But we don 't <unk> when we 've got this because we 've heard these things so much of the way we have completely <unk> and <unk> the <unk> that creativity is a few <unk> and <unk> , the art , and that art , to <unk> , and that art , and that art , at the <unk> .
And the question I want to all of all here today is , you 're going to do this ?
You 'll go to this thing -- because it also <unk> from a <unk> of a <unk> of <unk> .
I think it 's <unk> .
And I think it 's also <unk> , I don 't want to <unk> <unk> in the next century .
I think it 's better <unk> our big <unk> to live .
And I know , in my case -- it would be very <unk> to <unk> to that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in which I 'm in my career .
<unk> -- look at , I 'm pretty young , I have about 40 years .
I still about four <unk> <unk> in me .
And it 's very <unk> that any <unk> of the <unk> will be <unk> from the world , the <unk> that <unk> after the <unk> <unk> , I 'm going to be <unk> from the world .
<unk> <unk> , because we 're all more friends here -- it 's <unk> that my largest <unk> is to my <unk> .
Oh , <unk> , who thought !
You know , this is the kind of thinking that brings a person to <unk> <unk> <unk> on the morning and I don 't want to do it .
I 'm going to do this work that I love .
So , the question is it , how ?
And so so , I think , after a lot of <unk> , that the way to try to write a <unk> <unk> , right ?
I 've got to get a <unk> of <unk> between me , which I 'm <unk> , and my natural <unk> on which is going to get up , and I 'm going to go to <unk> all last year of the last year , on the time , and I 'm going to see that , I 'm going to get more <unk> and more <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> , if you 're going to be <unk> .
<unk> , how to help people <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of creativity .
And that research <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
<unk> because we 're going to go back .
<unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> -- people don 't believe that <unk> creativity <unk> , OK ?
It <unk> that creativity was this <unk> <unk> and <unk> , and <unk> to the men from a few <unk> <unk> and <unk> , for reasons and <unk> , for <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of creativity <unk> <unk> of creativity <unk> .
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> to have a <unk> that <unk> <unk> from <unk> .
<unk> were the same idea , but we were <unk> that species of the spirit without a <unk> .
The <unk> is <unk> , because the <unk> doesn 't really <unk> that a <unk> was somebody who are particularly <unk> .
I thought that a <unk> was this kind of <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of a artist , and that we 're going to <unk> the work of the artist and <unk> <unk> the result of that I 'm going to <unk> the work of that work .
<unk> <unk> here , that 's the <unk> of what I 'm going to tell you from the <unk> that <unk> you from the <unk> .
And all <unk> that was so that we <unk> , right ?
So , <unk> artists were <unk> from <unk> things , like for example , how much for the too <unk> , no ?
If your work was <unk> , you know , you know , all <unk> that <unk> , all <unk> that <unk> <unk> .
If your <unk> work , it was not all your <unk> , right ?
All you know that the <unk> <unk> to be a <unk> .
And so people <unk> <unk> creativity in <unk> for a lot of time .
Then the <unk> <unk> and all <unk> , and we <unk> this big idea ; we get the human <unk> on the universe all the <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and
This was the <unk> <unk> and people <unk> to think that <unk> creativity <unk> .
And for the first time in the history , you get to <unk> this or that artist as a <unk> <unk> , which is a <unk> person with <unk> .
And I have to <unk> , I think that was a big <unk> .
I think I would be <unk> , a simple person of believe that , a <unk> , like the <unk> , the <unk> and <unk> of all the <unk> <unk> , <unk> and <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of the <unk> of human <unk> .
It 's like to somebody of <unk> the sun .
<unk> and <unk> the <unk> and it <unk> all these <unk> <unk> on the <unk> .
And I think it 's been this <unk> <unk> artists in <unk> .
And , if this is true , I think that 's the question , it 's the question , it 's going to it ?
So we can do that ?
I 'm going to go to a more understanding of human relationship between humans and <unk> .
Or maybe it 's not .
Maybe we can 't 500 years of thinking about <unk> in a <unk> <unk> in a <unk> <unk> .
And there 's probably people between the audience that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> on the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> that people are <unk> <unk> on their projects .
You can 't have all about this thing .
But the question I 'd like to <unk> is -- why ?
Why do we don 't we do it ?
Because it 's more sense of every other thing that you 've ever heard for the <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
A process that , like anyone who ever ever <unk> to do something -- so , all here -- so , all here -- you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , a process of a process ,
And , in fact , it can be completely <unk> .
I 've got this <unk> <unk> <unk> , which has now <unk> , who has now <unk> , but that 's a <unk> for all the life and said that in his <unk> <unk> , <unk> out of the <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , and <unk> , and when a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and when you get the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
I said that it was like a <unk> <unk> .
And that 's going to <unk> <unk> .
They <unk> it , because he was <unk> the land under his feet .
I 'm going to have one thing to do that point and it was , words , " <unk> like a <unk> . "
And I 'm going to go back and it was <unk> from this <unk> , and it didn 't have to get another piece of paper and a <unk> enough enough enough , and a <unk> <unk> on the page .
They don 't get to be <unk> enough , so <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> without able to get home and <unk> and <unk> <unk> through her <unk> and <unk> and <unk> <unk> through <unk> , and he would be <unk> through <unk> , and he would be <unk> through the <unk> , and he would be <unk> and <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> and
Then there were those times -- this piece of never -- there were the moments of the time that the was almost <unk> , right ?
So , he was <unk> home and he was trying to <unk> out of paper and <unk> the <unk> through , and he was <unk> a <unk> in the <unk> , and he said , that it was <unk> with the other and <unk> .
<unk> <unk> the tail and the <unk> in his body and the <unk> on the page .
And in these cases , the <unk> <unk> , it would be <unk> on the page and <unk> , but the last word to the last word .
So when I <unk> <unk> -- it 's <unk> , it 's exactly <unk> ,
I don 't have my <unk> -- I 'm not a <unk> !
I 'm a <unk> , and my way of <unk> is ; it 's <unk> , at the same <unk> every day and <unk> .
But even I was <unk> against that , I <unk> against that what , at times .
And I think that 's also a lot of you know ,
You know , even if the work and ideas I <unk> me to <unk> <unk> .
And what is this ?
And how we can we <unk> it in a way we don 't have your head , but , rather , rather , which <unk> <unk> <unk> ?
So , as I 'm going to be the best example I have <unk> <unk> , which I have <unk> different years ago to a <unk> .
I 'm talking about this , and you know , <unk> , for the <unk> of life was the <unk> artist artist <unk> , trying to <unk> , <unk> these species of <unk> <unk> <unk> .
But then , it was <unk> , and a day , and a day , and a day , it was <unk> <unk> , <unk> everything for him .
<unk> , it 's all of a <unk> <unk> , which is <unk> , <unk> , which comes in his head , and <unk> , and <unk> , and the wants , you , you know , it 's wonderful , but not like <unk> .
It 's not a piece of paper , it 's not a <unk> , not a <unk> .
So I 'm going to feel like this <unk> <unk> in him in him , " I 'm going to <unk> , and <unk> from this song .
I 'm not <unk> and I can 't <unk> . "
And instead of going to go in <unk> , you know .
I 'm going to <unk> the whole process and made something new .
I just <unk> the sky and said , " <unk> , you don 't see you you know , you know , you know , "
" You know that it can write a song now ?
If you 're going to <unk> , you 're going to get a <unk> of you .
<unk> , <unk> <unk> else today .
I 'm going to <unk> <unk> <unk> . "
And his process <unk> after this .
I don 't have the work , the work was still <unk> like always .
But the process , and the <unk> <unk> that <unk> was <unk> when we <unk> the <unk> , the <unk> that we <unk> out of the <unk> that problems and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . And we had to be a <unk> .
But I 'm going to <unk> this , <unk> a <unk> <unk> and this thing <unk> and this <unk> <unk> , and this thing <unk> and this thing <unk> and this thing , but it was <unk> .
So , so how <unk> the story to change a little bit of the way I <unk> and I 've got a time .
This idea , I was <unk> when I was <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and we 're not going to be <unk> , and we 're not going to think that we 're working on something and we can 't think that you 're on the book .
They 're not just <unk> , just the <unk> book .
And I 'm going to think of <unk> this project .
But then I 'm going to <unk> <unk> that <unk> to the air and <unk> us .
So I <unk> my <unk> on the <unk> and <unk> my <unk> to <unk> and <unk> my <unk> to a <unk> <unk> .
And I said , " <unk> , " <unk> , " <unk> , what 's all about it will be <unk> . It 's not going to be <unk> , no ?
Because you see I 'm <unk> all of the what I have , I don 't have more than this .
So if you want to be better , you have to <unk> and do your part .
OK . But if you don 't do it , you know what , I 'm not going .
I 'm going to write the same because it 's my work .
And I 'd like to ask you that I 'm <unk> to do my <unk> . I 'm <unk> for the <unk> .
And they were always <unk> , because the <unk> were <unk> and they were <unk> .
But every much , <unk> , something <unk> , and one of these <unk> artists actually <unk> .
And I know , I know , because I know , because I know that you 're all the view , a <unk> .
It was like if you know , you know , and the <unk> <unk> through a kind of <unk> and it was doing anything different from <unk> , like <unk> <unk> , like <unk> , but all of it .
And at a <unk> , you 're not just like a human human human .
But it 's <unk> from <unk> and <unk> in the <unk> .
And when this <unk> , at the time , people <unk> what was , <unk> with his name .
<unk> your hands and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , God , God , God , God , God , God , God , " God , "
That 's God , you know .
I 'm going to <unk> -- when the <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> this <unk> <unk> , <unk> this <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , " <unk> , " <unk> , " <unk> , " which you can see in <unk> or <unk> .
In <unk> , when a artist has done something impossible and <unk> , " <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> -- one <unk> of God .
And it 's <unk> because we need .
But , the problem comes the day , for the <unk> , when you get <unk> and <unk> that are 11 <unk> of <unk> and God of God of God is no longer .
It 's just a <unk> with <unk> <unk> , and maybe not <unk> , and maybe not <unk> , and maybe never <unk> to that <unk> .
And maybe nobody <unk> the name of God still still , and what it must do with the rest of his life ?
It 's hard .
This is one of the <unk> <unk> to do in a <unk> life .
But maybe it 's not to be <unk> , if you 're going to be <unk> , <unk> , which the most <unk> of you are .
But we just just <unk> you 're going to get you in <unk> from a <unk> of this <unk> <unk> of your life that you have to go .
And , you know , if we think about this .
And so I started <unk> , and it 's like I <unk> for different months in the <unk> of the book that was <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> ,
And that I have to <unk> when I feel <unk> , I feel <unk> from this is , not <unk> .
It 's not <unk> .
They 're going to <unk> for your part , any of any .
If your work is <unk> , <unk> .
If the <unk> , you 're going to <unk> you <unk> <unk> <unk> some kind of <unk> , for a <unk> , for just a moment through your <unk> , then , then , " <unk> ! "
<unk> , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know
And " <unk> ! " You 're going to do it .
I think , and I think you know ,
" <unk> ! " You know , even for the same , even for <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Thank you .
Thank you .
<unk> <unk> : <unk> !
So , you know about some of these projects on the human genome , on what it can <unk> and about about <unk> <unk> of <unk> .
We 're going to <unk> a new <unk> . And we started <unk> the biology and now now , we 're <unk> in a new <unk> of biology , <unk> and <unk> life .
We 've been trying to <unk> <unk> .
" <unk> is life ? " It 's something that many <unk> I think they have <unk> to understand the <unk> .
We tried to <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> .
We 're going to be 20 years .
When we <unk> the human genome , we <unk> the human genome of biology in the digital world of the computer .
Now we can we <unk> the life , or create new life on this digital universe ?
This is the map of a little <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , which is the species from the <unk> of the the <unk> that can <unk> .
And we tried to <unk> the genome for <unk> a more <unk> .
We 're able to <unk> a <unk> of <unk> that are here .
But when we take a look at its map , it 's simple than our <unk> .
<unk> , this is simple .
But when we look at all that genes we can <unk> , one at the time , it 's very <unk> that can get a <unk> cell .
So I 'm going to <unk> that the only <unk> this <unk> <unk> <unk> for some of <unk> <unk> the <unk> for some of these questions .
So we started the <unk> of the " <unk> , we can we <unk> a <unk> ? "
Is it the <unk> <unk> of produce these big molecules that we never have to create the first time ?
And , in case , we can we make a <unk> ?
A <unk> is just a piece of <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> that we 're able to <unk> life is <unk> <unk> .
Our ability to write the code , instead , instead , <unk> , but it 's <unk> .
And our <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> .
We 've got more than 15 years ago .
The process has <unk> a lot of <unk> , <unk> with a <unk> <unk> before that we <unk> the first experiments .
But we 've found that DNA DNA is very difficult .
There are <unk> of thousands of machines that <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , of <unk> <unk> , of <unk> <unk> , and it 's a process <unk> : the most <unk> is a process .
So we had to develop a new <unk> for <unk> , and we <unk> the <unk> .
And that 's our first <unk> , at the information of the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
It 's a little <unk> that bacteria .
We <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The interesting thing is when we have this piece of <unk> <unk> and we <unk> it in bacteria , the bacteria have <unk> to read this code and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> .
I 've been been <unk> with the <unk> industry that they have <unk> this model .
They have more than you .
I think that 's a situation that the software can actually build his same <unk> in a <unk> system .
But we 're going to do the most <unk> .
We 're going to build the <unk> .
I 'm more than <unk> <unk> <unk> .
So we thought of <unk> in the size of the <unk> , so that we can change the <unk> to understand what they are <unk> to understand what they are <unk> of a <unk> .
<unk> is <unk> , and if we 're going to <unk> information in a computer , these must be very <unk> .
When we <unk> this genome for the first time in the <unk> <unk> was a <unk> for every 10 <unk> <unk> .
We 've found , <unk> , 30 . If we used that original <unk> that original <unk> never been able to do it .
One of the process is <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> with all the other <unk> of 50 <unk> to build <unk> more <unk> .
We 're going to be <unk> .
You 've got to read that <unk> .
<unk> so : we have a <unk> code on four <unk> : <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
I 'm going to <unk> <unk> <unk> , about 20 <unk> , and there 's a <unk> <unk> for every <unk> .
So we can use the <unk> code for <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
What we did we did in the beginning is <unk> .
Some of the <unk> that it was not <unk> .
We 've <unk> these <unk> <unk> <unk> .
There are <unk> that <unk> <unk> and <unk> them .
And we started <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> with <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And in every step , we have a <unk> in <unk> so that we 're <unk> to create a <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , as you 'll see in a minute .
We 're trying to <unk> the process .
So , this seems the <unk> of a <unk> .
When we 're going to <unk> these <unk> <unk> , more than 100 <unk> , not <unk> <unk> <unk> .
You get to <unk> the <unk> of biology .
So we 've got <unk> other <unk> .
I 'm going to be <unk> <unk> , which in biology <unk> to <unk> the DNA that can <unk> .
Here 's a example .
This <unk> <unk> , it can <unk> three million <unk> of <unk> .
You can see in the <unk> <unk> , like his <unk> <unk> .
In 12 -- it 's 24 hours , it 's <unk> .
<unk> thousands of organisms that are able to do that .
These organisms can <unk> .
We 're going to live in <unk> .
They 're absolutely sure that life <unk> in space , and you get <unk> to find new <unk> <unk> .
So , it 's the true <unk> that this is that this is .
This is an image of the <unk> that we 've built using these <unk> , just using these <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> .
This picture was not <unk> with a <unk> <unk> , but with a <unk> <unk> .
It 's a <unk> that we can <unk> with a <unk> <unk> .
These are <unk> that <unk> a period of about six seconds .
This is the <unk> that we did a time ago .
I 'm more than <unk> <unk> .
It 's the largest <unk> of a <unk> <unk> .
It 's a <unk> weight to 300 million .
If you <unk> with a <unk> <unk> , we 've got <unk> <unk> pages for this code .
Now , how do we do it ?
Of course , with a <unk> <unk> .
It 's a little bit more <unk> when they use it .
It 's more simple when you 're <unk> cells like our <unk> , you can just <unk> the <unk> and <unk> another , which is that we can just <unk> the process of <unk> .
In <unk> <unk> , the <unk> is instead of <unk> in the cell , but we 've <unk> <unk> that we 're able to do a <unk> of a cell cell to another cell cell cell to another cell ,
We 've got a <unk> <unk> from a species .
<unk> are different than men from <unk> .
We 've got a few <unk> in the way to decide what you can be able to do this <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> <unk> in a way to <unk> all the <unk> .
And when we <unk> it in the cell was <unk> and <unk> our <unk> <unk> the new <unk> <unk> , the new <unk> ,
And we 're going to go beyond , but we tried to <unk> , but we tried to <unk> more there .
This is one of the <unk> of evolution .
We found that <unk> species have <unk> a second or a third <unk> , <unk> in a second thousands of <unk> , in a second thousands of new <unk> to that species .
So who think about evolution as a <unk> at the time that you 're <unk> not <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> that was in the cell <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> that we <unk> <unk> .
It 's <unk> , and it <unk> the other <unk> like <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and we 've <unk> with only the cell and the new <unk> .
It 's become blue <unk> , which we 've <unk> .
And in a short <unk> of time , all the <unk> of a kind of a kind of <unk> , and it 's <unk> all in a new species , <unk> on the software .
All the <unk> are <unk> , <unk> are <unk> , and when we <unk> the code <unk> <unk> exactly exactly what we have .
Now , this may look at <unk> , but we can change the DNA <unk> , but we can change things .
Now , I 've been <unk> that here 's not about <unk> -- but of it <unk> -- but of the evolution of evolution and a half years of evolution and a half years of evolution , in which we 're going to create a new <unk> version of the digital <unk> <unk> in which <unk> <unk> .
Why do do you ?
I think it 's enough when we think about our <unk> .
We 're going to go from six billion and a half of people in the next 40 years .
So , I 'm going to be <unk> .
Now there are three people on the planet to <unk> <unk> ; it 's about 40 years , there will be four .
We 're <unk> problems now at food , <unk> and <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , <unk> and a half of people .
We 're going to be <unk> for nine billion .
<unk> more than five billion <unk> , more than 30 billion billion <unk> <unk> .
That means percent of <unk> a day .
When we 're going to find <unk> <unk> , or any kind of <unk> , it will be a huge challenge .
And we have to <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> of CO2 from these materials that <unk> in the atmosphere .
At the day , I 'm going to <unk> the <unk> in the <unk> around the world , we have a <unk> with about 20 million genes , and I like to think that the future <unk> for the future .
The industry <unk> just a <unk> of <unk> , and you think about how many different things are <unk> .
Our <unk> are <unk> on the reality of the <unk> and our imagination .
Now we have <unk> , thank you to these <unk> <unk> , and that can create what we call <unk> <unk> .
We 're able to build a big robot that can produce a million <unk> <unk> .
Think of <unk> these 20 million genes or <unk> to try to <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , new <unk> , new <unk> , we can change , <unk> , and create more biology biology in the last 20 years .
And it 's just a <unk> <unk> .
We can have to <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
This is a <unk> of some software software that we 're working for being able to be able to <unk> and design species to <unk> .
Well , we don 't know how they will be .
We know exactly what their <unk> code .
We 're going to <unk> on the <unk> generation .
You 've seen you know that <unk> <unk> from the <unk> was a <unk> .
We 've got <unk> <unk> , the third generation that we 're going to <unk> <unk> , more <unk> , like <unk> or different kinds of <unk> .
But the only way that biology can have a big impact without <unk> the cost of food and <unk> the cost of food and <unk> , it would be <unk> the CO2 of the food , that we 're working for us working on the first months , and we think we can get the first months in <unk> of <unk> ,
<unk> light <unk> with the CO2 is a <unk> , but in our <unk> in our <unk> around the world , we found different <unk> .
This is a <unk> that we 've <unk> in <unk> .
<unk> in the ocean , at about <unk> feet to the <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> from the <unk> of energy as the <unk> of energy .
We 're trying to understand if we can <unk> the CO2 , that can be <unk> by <unk> , <unk> that CO2 in <unk> , to <unk> that process .
So so we think of short we think we can be able to <unk> what the question of the <unk> , " which is , we have the <unk> goal of <unk> the whole industry .
<unk> . If you can 't do that TED , where you can ?
It 's the main source of energy .
And we 're working for the same <unk> to create <unk> <unk> .
You 've seen this year with the flu , we 're always back to a dollar in less when you get the right <unk> .
I think that you can change building <unk> <unk> in <unk> .
Here 's how the future could start to look at <unk> , now , the tree evolution , <unk> evolution with bacteria bacteria , <unk> and finally cells .
We 're at so <unk> .
Our goal is to do in a way to live enough to try to try to try to try to <unk> . Thank you very much .
First of all I 'm going to show you , the more <unk> , some fundamental <unk> , of new technology that we 've got to <unk> a <unk> . This is just a <unk> . This is <unk> .
It 's a environment that you can <unk> is in local level that <unk> with a huge amount of data .
Here we 're seeing <unk> <unk> <unk> with a kind of <unk> <unk> , and <unk> , for a <unk> <unk> , <unk> images , <unk> images , like we want .
And not how much much of information that we see , how much of information that we see , how these <unk> are .
Most of the <unk> are <unk> , but this for example is a <unk> <unk> from the <unk> <unk> , and <unk> in <unk> <unk> , and <unk> in <unk> .
It 's not a difference because the only thing that <unk> the <unk> of a system like this is the number of <unk> on your screen in any time . It 's a very <unk> architecture .
This is a book , example of data is not not images .
This is <unk> <unk> .
So , it 's just about the <unk> and not images , we can do something like this , to do something like this , to make really <unk> , not a real <unk> of a picture .
It could be a way to read a <unk> book .
I 'm not going to tell you .
This is a <unk> example . It 's a number of <unk> .
Every image is the beginning of a <unk> .
And it 's really the <unk> and the <unk> experience of read the real <unk> version of a <unk> or a <unk> , which is to nature a <unk> , which is a <unk> <unk> .
We also did something with the <unk> of this particular <unk> .
We 've created a <unk> <unk> <unk> much more than that you use in a normal <unk> , and we 've <unk> <unk> .
If you want to see the <unk> of this <unk> , you can see here .
Or other models , or even <unk> <unk> .
And this really <unk> some of these ideas to <unk> the <unk> of space on the screen .
I 'm going to <unk> this <unk> and other <unk> <unk> , <unk> , not <unk> to be <unk> .
Of course , the <unk> is one of the <unk> <unk> for this kind of technology .
And on this is not going to do you , if we don 't say that we have <unk> to be in this field .
These are all the <unk> in the United States <unk> , a <unk> image of <unk> .
So now I 'm going to do something else .
This is actually actually <unk> on the Web ; you can see it .
It 's a project called <unk> , which <unk> two different technologies .
One is <unk> and the other is a <unk> <unk> to a very interesting <unk> <unk> , <unk> , a student of Washington , with <unk> <unk> <unk> , with <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And it 's <unk> <unk> .
You can see when we do this kind of <unk> , where we can go from another image and have this kind of experience to <unk> .
But the <unk> <unk> of the images here has actually a meaning .
<unk> <unk> <unk> on the computer have these images , in the way that we 're going to <unk> places that <unk> all <unk> <unk> on the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and these things are all <unk> things , and these things are all <unk> of these are <unk> <unk> .
I don 't know if I 've got to show you some other environment .
There are some <unk> .
I want to go to one of the <unk> data of <unk> and this <unk> <unk> , and this <unk> <unk> <unk> that we did work for the first time <unk> , that we 've done this technology about the <unk> <unk> . And it 's not so much <unk> <unk> . And it 's not so <unk> <unk> <unk> that we 've got <unk> <unk> that we have done in the website .
We had to <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
This is a <unk> of <unk> <unk> images from <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> images of <unk> and <unk> images of <unk> and <unk> images of these <unk> <unk> and <unk> and <unk> images of these <unk> <unk> <unk> .
So I 'm all <unk> images from <unk> and they 're all <unk> <unk> in this way .
And it 's possible to <unk> this way .
You know , I 'd never thought about it .
It 's very <unk> <unk> this kind of <unk> here .
I think you can see that it 's a lot of <unk> . <unk> : from those phones phones are <unk> , a number <unk> , a number <unk> , <unk> together in this environment .
And if I can , I can try to try to look at those <unk> .
There are <unk> <unk> , <unk> .
So , then you 're a <unk> of pictures -- <unk> .
This is a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
We can go from the <unk> physics of this environment .
The <unk> is that we can do about the social environment . This is now <unk> data from <unk> <unk> from the whole memory of <unk> as <unk> , from the point of view of view , and all those data .
All those pictures are going to be <unk> , more than the <unk> .
You have a model of the land that we 're going to be <unk> .
Think about this as a <unk> of the <unk> <unk> on the Earth <unk> .
It 's something that <unk> in <unk> , and the <unk> that people <unk> , and the <unk> that <unk> <unk> with the <unk> .
They 're <unk> with <unk> <unk> from other people .
If somebody is the idea of <unk> all these <unk> <unk> , the name , my <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in that space , and then I can be a social experience and <unk> , and then you know , if you can have a social experience .
Of course , a <unk> of all of all the interesting <unk> of every interesting part of the land , <unk> , <unk> not just from <unk> and <unk> images , but from the <unk> <unk> .
Thank you very much .
Chris Anderson : I realized ? What 's what your software software <unk> us to do is that to do is that in the next years , all the <unk> <unk> of anybody in the world will be <unk> together ?
<unk> : Yeah . What 's doing it 's doing it .
It 's <unk> , if you want , between images .
And it 's doing it in the <unk> of the images .
The thing is it very interesting if you think about information that many of the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> .
So , you do it a research of images on the Web , you get a <unk> and the page on the page page is a lot about the information of the picture .
Now , what if that picture you get all your picture ?
So , the amount of <unk> <unk> and the amount of <unk> that it 's really enormous . It 's a <unk> effect .
CA : <unk> , it 's really amazing .
<unk> : I 'm going to be very .
One of the <unk> that <unk> and one of the <unk> of the research <unk> is the live between who don 't have <unk> <unk> , between <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
I think that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , or that <unk> <unk> , or that <unk> <unk> , or that <unk> are still <unk> , or that <unk> , or that <unk> <unk> , to <unk> the <unk> <unk> , to <unk> the <unk> <unk> , and the idea that the world 's idea that the world 's idea that the world we have no <unk> , but just <unk> , but it 's a <unk> of a <unk> <unk> ,
<unk> <unk> <unk> that our <unk> <unk> that our <unk> <unk> has done , <unk> , good , a lot of <unk> .
And , of course , all of course , all of the <unk> <unk> .
Everybody <unk> . All <unk> .
We 're <unk> <unk> .
We have to <unk> the <unk> of death , so we don 't get <unk> , if you get <unk> and <unk> --
We all have a art art .
What <unk> is the particular <unk> of the song , the <unk> of every culture .
It 's not that the <unk> of the <unk> , or <unk> <unk> <unk> , or <unk> <unk> , or <unk> <unk> <unk> , or a <unk> <unk> <unk> , or a <unk> in the <unk> .
He was my <unk> in <unk> a month ago , or a <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , on the <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> mother of the world .
All these <unk> <unk> that there are other ways of <unk> that there are other ways of thinking , other ways of the world .
And , if you get a minute , it 's a idea that can give you hope .
<unk> , <unk> <unk> of the world <unk> create a <unk> of life and <unk> that <unk> the planet and important for the <unk> of the planet , so as the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And you can think of this <unk> <unk> like a <unk> , and you can <unk> the <unk> <unk> the <unk> of all the <unk> , <unk> ideas , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> in the human imagination .
<unk> is the <unk> of humanity .
It 's the <unk> of what we 're and what we can be as a <unk> .
And I <unk> <unk> <unk> was <unk> <unk> , it 's happened to <unk> and <unk> much more <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , for example , <unk> that 50 percent of all the species is , or the <unk> <unk> <unk> , because it 's <unk> , or -- it 's more <unk> -- and you don 't even even even even <unk> <unk> -- and not not even even <unk> <unk> -- that 's the <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> -- that <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> of all is , of course , the <unk> <unk> .
When you 're <unk> <unk> on this planet .
One language is not just <unk> from a <unk> or a series of <unk> <unk> .
One of the human spirit .
It 's the middle of the which <unk> of every culture comes in the material .
Every language is a forest of the mind , a <unk> , a thinking , a <unk> of <unk> .
And of those <unk> <unk> , as we 're here in <unk> , at least half the <unk> of the children .
They 're not <unk> to children , the <unk> that means , less than that they 're <unk> .
What 's more <unk> of the being <unk> from the <unk> , of the last last to talk about a language , of the <unk> , or <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , or of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , or <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , or <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> , or of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> , or <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> ,
This <unk> <unk> was the <unk> of somebody in the <unk> of every two weeks , every two weeks , two weeks , and it <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of a language .
And I know that somebody of you <unk> , " Don 't it better ?
The world would not have a better place if we all all the same language ? " <unk> , then we 're all <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> .
I 'm going to be <unk> , which means we can 't talk about your language .
I 'd like to do you to do a <unk> .
And a little journey in <unk> for you a <unk> of what we 're <unk> .
Many of us <unk> that when I say , " I 'm really <unk> , " I 'm really different ways of <unk> .
I 'm going to be <unk> , in <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , which <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
It 's a <unk> that 's not able to <unk> the blue color , because the green <unk> is <unk> in the green because the <unk> <unk> .
They have a <unk> language and a <unk> rule , <unk> <unk> , " <unk> <unk> , " You have to <unk> a person that 's language .
All that 's <unk> in the past <unk> , but the <unk> is that in these families you 're going to be <unk> or seven seven <unk> <unk> , nobody 's language .
You can go and <unk> and then you 're going to talk .
I 've got a <unk> <unk> with the <unk> that I 've been <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , a incredible <unk> that had the first <unk> in <unk> .
In <unk> five <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
They 've done from the <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> , <unk> that <unk> <unk> , <unk> that <unk> <unk> had never seen anything .
They have <unk> the <unk> <unk> , <unk> have <unk> to research a form of the form , or a form , not <unk> , they have <unk> <unk> , and they have <unk> five <unk> with <unk> .
But the <unk> <unk> .
They have <unk> .
<unk> percent of <unk> was <unk> to their own .
We 're <unk> eight <unk> and we 've found two <unk> of death and when we 've been <unk> for , they have <unk> that one of them was so that it 's dead <unk> , and then they have the same <unk> . And then they have the same <unk> of the forest .
<unk> were able to <unk> the animal from 40 <unk> and <unk> .
I was the first <unk> , I was a very interesting <unk> when my <unk> <unk> <unk> , I wanted to go to <unk> <unk> , if I wanted to go to <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> .
So , to give you a sense of <unk> , I would have to understand the culture , and that <unk> is not <unk> .
It 's pretty much of a <unk> <unk> <unk> of the world .
Very interesting .
If you get the big <unk> of the world , what I <unk> ?
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , etc .
A continent is always <unk> out , thinking that Africa <unk> doesn 't <unk> <unk> . And instead of course , it 's not another that the <unk> of these <unk> <unk> <unk> .
What makes the <unk> is the <unk> of the <unk> between life and death .
So the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> can be <unk> from <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> , that it 's a short short short <unk> .
So , to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
We 're going to <unk> and <unk> God . "
And that 's the <unk> that you 're <unk> , is the spirit that you can you <unk> ?
So you 're <unk> to these things : <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
I all the <unk> with the <unk> that I 've been <unk> the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , in <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> that once <unk> on the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> on <unk> <unk> .
In a <unk> continent , this <unk> is never been <unk> <unk> .
And I 'm <unk> today are <unk> from a <unk> , but their <unk> is amazing .
<unk> <unk> <unk> from <unk> to three , and live in <unk> , and live in a world <unk> in <unk> and <unk> in <unk> <unk> <unk> for 18 years .
Two <unk> years <unk> <unk> <unk> .
So , this time , they 're <unk> to values , values that they <unk> that their <unk> and just their <unk> <unk> -- or to say , or better <unk> <unk> <unk> .
At the <unk> of this incredible <unk> , they <unk> out and for the first time in their life , at the age of 18 years , you see a <unk> . And that 's first <unk> of the first <unk> , when the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , all that they have to <unk> <unk> <unk> , all that they 're going to go back to <unk> , and then <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , all of all all all all of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> .
" <unk> ? <unk> how do I said .
It 's <unk> . Now it 's <unk> . "
They 're <unk> <unk> , they say that we <unk> , we 're the <unk> of the world .
This is extremely important .
When we think about <unk> and the environment <unk> and the <unk> <unk> and the <unk> story of <unk> , which is a <unk> <unk> , or maybe <unk> <unk> <unk> , and we say that these <unk> are more to the Earth .
<unk> <unk> are not <unk> or <unk> from <unk> .
There 's no space for these things in the <unk> of <unk> or in <unk> <unk> , but you have a <unk> of <unk> , but on the time and <unk> , they have a <unk> of the <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> , but on a <unk> , the <unk> that the Earth can live because it 's just <unk> to live in <unk> <unk> .
What does it mean ?
It 's going to say that a <unk> <unk> that the mountain is a <unk> <unk> that the mountain is a human spirit , it will be a human <unk> , and it will have a different relationship with the mountain or that place in the mountain that you 're a mountain is a mountain of a mountain of <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> that 's a mountain is a mountain of <unk> <unk> .
which is the <unk> of a spirit or a <unk> <unk> is <unk> .
What 's interesting is the <unk> that we <unk> the relationship between the <unk> and the natural world world .
I grew up in the <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> for <unk> .
What <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> that live in my <unk> <unk> , who believe that <unk> are the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> that live in the world , <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> .
If you 're going to <unk> that these <unk> can create different <unk> , <unk> to understand some <unk> <unk> . <unk> this <unk> .
I 've got this picture at <unk> <unk> .
Maybe some of you have heard about the <unk> , the most powerful <unk> <unk> <unk> .
What makes it <unk> is not the potential <unk> of the <unk> , but his <unk> . It 's <unk> from two .
So , then , this <unk> <unk> that has a series of <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
<unk> the only <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> a little <unk> that <unk> a little <unk> , but it 's <unk> with <unk> of a family <unk> <unk> <unk> .
This <unk> <unk> <unk> , very <unk> , very <unk> , <unk> .
If you 'll see the <unk> <unk> on the <unk> that they do from a different <unk> of species , <unk> <unk> .
<unk> that <unk> on the <unk> is a little bit like to be <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> on a <unk> <unk> and <unk> on a <unk> of electricity . It 's <unk> . It 's about a <unk> of reality ; it it 's <unk> .
I often had to be <unk> with my <unk> , Richard <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , with his <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> .
My <unk> can 't be <unk> these <unk> as you 're <unk> , because you 're not going to tell nobody of being <unk> . <unk> <unk> <unk> , but they can 't be <unk> because they 're <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
It 's possible to <unk> <unk> , if you can <unk> with other <unk> <unk> that <unk> .
Now , the <unk> that are <unk> in this <unk> are <unk> of the <unk> , the same kind of <unk> , the same question . The question <unk> <unk> <unk> : in a <unk> of plants , like these two <unk> <unk> , like these two <unk> <unk> , but that if you 're going to be <unk> , which is <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , if you have a <unk> <unk> ?
We use the big <unk> of the <unk> and <unk> , which can <unk> <unk> .
But if we <unk> <unk> , we 're going to be <unk> , " <unk> <unk> . "
What does it mean ?
This <unk> , <unk> <unk> , which <unk> <unk> , which <unk> <unk> <unk> in the forest , and we 're going to our eyes in the <unk> species .
If you <unk> as <unk> <unk> , they <unk> <unk> <unk> , " <unk> <unk> <unk> , the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest ? " I said , " No . "
The solution is , you get the <unk> <unk> in a night of <unk> and <unk> with a different <unk> .
And so we don 't get <unk> , but it 's much more interesting that <unk> .
Now , <unk> the problem is that the problem is that the <unk> of us that have to heart <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . But it 's over the <unk> of our world , and it 's over over .
In fact , in fact , in 300 years , not <unk> for his <unk> or his <unk> <unk> , but rather like the <unk> , but rather as the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> of the planet . Now , it 's not the problem . Now , it 's not the problem .
All the <unk> through the <unk> <unk> have been <unk> in a <unk> for new <unk> to <unk> .
And the problem is not the technology is not the technology .
<unk> <unk> have no <unk> of being <unk> when they have <unk> <unk> , and <unk> as <unk> as <unk> , they have <unk> <unk> , they have <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
It 's not the change or technology that <unk> <unk> . It 's the power of <unk> . It 's the power .
<unk> <unk> .
And if you look at the world , <unk> that these are not <unk> <unk> .
They 're <unk> <unk> out of the <unk> forces that go beyond their <unk> ,
<unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> --
<unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , a <unk> that has been in the forest to a generation , and now <unk> on the <unk> of <unk> , where you can see the <unk> <unk> <unk> , where you can see the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , where <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , where <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , where <unk> <unk> <unk> , where <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
I 'm going to <unk> <unk> with the <unk> <unk> to the forest .
Or in the case of the <unk> , they 're the <unk> of the <unk> .
If we <unk> on the <unk> , where I 'm doing a lot of <unk> , you 'll see the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> .
So , <unk> <unk> physics of a <unk> , is <unk> <unk> , but the <unk> , <unk> , but the <unk> , the <unk> of <unk> , not just <unk> , but <unk> <unk> in some <unk> , but <unk> <unk> in some <unk> of development .
And you can 't understand the <unk> <unk> until you can 't understand the beginning .
I 've got the <unk> miles in China through the <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> with a young <unk> , but just <unk> <unk> with a young <unk> , but just <unk> to talk about .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> million people <unk> from <unk> <unk> .
The father of this guy was <unk> to <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> that means that it 's been <unk> to the Chinese <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> , which has <unk> the <unk> in <unk> .
<unk> mother was <unk> and his <unk> was <unk> .
It was <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> at the age of two <unk> years , <unk> <unk> , because they didn 't have a <unk> .
<unk> , which has done the same , it was <unk> in <unk> .
A day has <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and , for this <unk> , for this <unk> , was <unk> to <unk> seven years .
The <unk> of the <unk> can be <unk> , but the spirit of the <unk> of <unk> is <unk> .
And finally , it 's all <unk> to a choice .
<unk> live in the <unk> world , or we want to <unk> the world of the <unk> world ?
<unk> <unk> <unk> , before the <unk> <unk> , before he said that his <unk> <unk> was that his <unk> <unk> , in our <unk> <unk> , not only <unk> the whole <unk> of human imagination to <unk> a <unk> of human imagination , but a day there was a day , and a day there was <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , there were other other <unk> .
And it 's <unk> to remember that our species is <unk> for <unk> years .
<unk> <unk> , that <unk> us , which has <unk> us <unk> , which <unk> us to <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and we talk about <unk> , and we talk about <unk> , and we talk about <unk> years ago .
The <unk> world has <unk> <unk> <unk> .
That <unk> story I 'm not <unk> that we have the <unk> to all the challenges that we can be <unk> in <unk> .
When we 're going to <unk> <unk> of the world is asked what it 's <unk> with <unk> <unk> .
And it 's in these answers that we all all <unk> the <unk> of being what we 're <unk> the <unk> and all the <unk> can be a kind of <unk> , that there are great moments of <unk> . And there are big moments of <unk> .
I 've <unk> this picture on the <unk> <unk> , when I went to <unk> <unk> <unk> , and this man , <unk> me with the <unk> , and this man , <unk> me the <unk> story of his <unk> .
The government <unk> was not always <unk> with the <unk> <unk> and in the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> our <unk> , we have <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> of this man <unk> .
<unk> , <unk> for his life , <unk> <unk> all the <unk> , and all of his <unk> , and all of his <unk> .
I know that <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> of this man didn 't <unk> from night or <unk> <unk> that <unk> .
It 's <unk> on , it 's <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> in your own hand , and I <unk> in your hand . When I did <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
It 's <unk> <unk> on the <unk> of this <unk> and when <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> a dog .
It 's <unk> the dog and created a <unk> , with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> created a <unk> , has <unk> another dog , and it 's <unk> on <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> ? [ <unk> <unk> ? [ <unk> <unk> . And this , in different ways , [ [ <unk> <unk> <unk> and all the <unk> <unk> of the world .
<unk> <unk> <unk> government <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> of a <unk> area of <unk> , and the <unk> together .
It 's their new <unk> . It 's called <unk> .
It 's a <unk> <unk> .
One of the <unk> of how a <unk> can <unk> with his <unk> .
And , I think it 's pretty <unk> at least at least who 's pretty <unk> at least at least who are not <unk> .
For somebody is home .
<unk> <unk> of human imagination that <unk> to the <unk> of human imagination . And for us all , the dreams of these children , as the <unk> of the <unk> of the hope .
So we <unk> <unk> <unk> , we 're <unk> that <unk> <unk> , <unk> that the <unk> never <unk> .
<unk> <unk> --
<unk> <unk> , they 're not <unk> , but we believe that stories can change the world , and maybe we 're the best <unk> of stories of the world , we 're the best <unk> million <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Our <unk> are <unk> from millions of people .
Our work is <unk> in <unk> to <unk> our audience in places of <unk> <unk> from which <unk> <unk> from which <unk> <unk> from which <unk> , and they <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> the <unk> world 's <unk> , the world 's world 's <unk> , and we have to find a <unk> in a world of <unk> and <unk> <unk> in the world .
where the <unk> <unk> can <unk> <unk> to our <unk> <unk> .
Thank you .
I 'm going to talk about some things that I 've got in this book I hope you 've been <unk> and <unk> some <unk> <unk> .
I 'd like to start with what I call the <unk> <unk> . "
<unk> <unk> ?
The <unk> <unk> of all the <unk> society <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> : " If we want to <unk> the <unk> of our <unk> <unk> . "
The reason is , from the side , in fact that the freedom is in the same value , it 's <unk> , <unk> , <unk> for human beings .
And we 're going to be in fact that if we 're <unk> , each of us can be <unk> for all that we have our <unk> <unk> , no one that we 're going to be <unk> .
The way to <unk> the freedom is <unk> .
<unk> people have , more choices are <unk> , and the most <unk> , and the most of the freedom , is the largest <unk> .
This is <unk> , it 's so <unk> <unk> in society that nobody <unk> <unk> in <unk> .
And it 's also <unk> in our lives .
I 'm going to show you some examples of what the <unk> .
This is my <unk> . It 's not particularly big .
I <unk> a simple <unk> on the <unk> .
In my <unk> , there are <unk> <unk> , without <unk> the 10 <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and 12 <unk> <unk> that you can buy a huge number of <unk> in <unk> <unk> that nobody of the <unk> <unk> that nobody of the <unk> <unk> <unk> that nobody of your <unk> .
Here 's what the <unk> .
Then you go to the <unk> <unk> for buy a <unk> : <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
And in this single <unk> <unk> , there 's a big number of <unk> <unk> .
We can do it six million different <unk> using the <unk> that there are in a only <unk> .
<unk> <unk> that there is <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> .
So , when I was a child , they could get all the <unk> <unk> , <unk> that they were <unk> <unk> .
You know , you can 't <unk> it .
One of that , between the other , it was that the phone never <unk> .
These days , they went .
Now we have a <unk> <unk> , especially in the <unk> .
Here 's the future .
My <unk> is what 's in a half , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
If you don 't have the <unk> in the <unk> , you 're <unk> in the house , you 're <unk> .
And what 's the end of the end is that people <unk> in <unk> and this question , you know , the answer is the answer ? The answer is , " No . "
It 's not possible to buy a phone that doesn 't do it .
So , in other <unk> of life that are much more important than the <unk> , <unk> the same <unk> of choices .
<unk> <unk> : It 's not going on the United States that you 're going to <unk> you .
Instead , <unk> , and the <unk> says you say , " OK , " OK , " OK , " Well , " <unk> <unk> , " <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , " <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and these <unk> <unk> . What you want to do ? "
You <unk> , " <unk> , what do ? "
And the <unk> says , " <unk> <unk> , and these <unk> , and <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> . "
" What do you want to do ? "
And you said , " <unk> if you were me , what did ? "
And the <unk> : " But I 'm not not . "
The result of the <unk> <unk> , " <unk> , <unk> that <unk> it does look like a beautiful thing .
But it 's not that one <unk> the weight and the <unk> of the decisions of the decisions of the decisions , you know something , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , it 's <unk> -- so you don 't get in the patient .
There 's a huge <unk> of <unk> <unk> , <unk> people like me , and you , you know , you know , it doesn 't have any sense , because we can 't <unk> .
But if we can 't we <unk> , why do we can we <unk> them ?
The answer is that they want to <unk> the <unk> for <unk> <unk> .
And we have to be <unk> like our <unk> is a question of choice , like you see in this <unk> <unk> . " We don 't want to <unk> . " We don 't want to <unk> a <unk> .
And we can <unk> them .
And the means that every <unk> , you have to <unk> , you have to <unk> that kind of person you want to be .
I was going to <unk> , a time the common perspective , almost almost for anybody , it was that we could <unk> the more <unk> , and you get to <unk> the <unk> .
The only choice was with the who , not when , and even what do .
<unk> , all is really <unk> .
They 're going to be <unk> , and they 're <unk> their 20 percent in less than a time .
And they 're not not <unk> , because they 're less <unk> .
But why are they <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , or not ? "
" <unk> <unk> <unk> later ? I 've got to think before the <unk> , or to the career ? "
They 're <unk> .
And they 're trying to answer these questions , even if this <unk> don 't <unk> the <unk> that <unk> and not get a <unk> <unk> to my <unk> .
And they have to do it . They 're important .
Now , the work : we 're <unk> , like <unk> , because the technology <unk> us to work every day , every day , from every day , from every day of the planet , <unk> that we 're <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , there 's a <unk> , and I don 't tell you nobody , where the <unk> works .
I 'm not going to tell you , because I want to use it .
What it means , this incredible freedom to work ? It 's that we have to <unk> , <unk> in every moment , if we have to work , if we have to work .
We can go to <unk> , with the phone , with the phone in a <unk> , the <unk> in the other , and the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , on <unk> .
And even if I 'm all <unk> , every minute that we see our <unk> <unk> , we 're also <unk> , " I have to answer this called ? "
" I 've got to <unk> this <unk> ? "
And even when the answer is , " Well , this makes the experience of <unk> of your <unk> , very different <unk> , that it would be other that it would be other in the .
So , from any part of any <unk> , and big objects , and <unk> , the <unk> materials , life is a question of choices .
And one time the world was this <unk> , there were some <unk> , but it was not a question of choice .
The world of today is going to do this : <unk> is a <unk> , or <unk> ? "
The answer is <unk> .
<unk> <unk> them all , so we know , so I 'm going to talk about the <unk> .
It 's <unk> this choice .
The first <unk> , it 's <unk> <unk> , which <unk> <unk> .
And so so many <unk> of what you can be very difficult to do it .
I 'm going to give you a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
A <unk> <unk> <unk> , with about the data , <unk> society <unk> , with about a million <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> .
What she was that every 10 solutions that are <unk> in the most <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> two percent .
With 50 <unk> <unk> , there 's 10 percent in less than than you get when they 're <unk> . Because ?
Because with 50 <unk> of the <unk> that you 're going to decide , and the choice is <unk> .
And at <unk> , and again , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and course , you never get .
I mean it 's not just that these <unk> <unk> food for <unk> because they don 't have enough money , it 's the decision is so <unk> that we also <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
They 're not <unk> , they 're <unk> to five <unk> <unk> for the <unk> year , that it would be <unk> .
So the <unk> is a <unk> of the <unk> .
And I think that 's the world .
" And you get <unk> , for <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> or <unk> ? "
You know , you know , if it 's the right decision , right ?
You don 't want to have the <unk> <unk> .
So that 's the first effect . The second is that we can <unk> <unk> and make a choice , and make a choice , at the end of the way we 're less <unk> with <unk> of what you can .
And that 's a different reasons .
One of these is that with many <unk> of which you have been <unk> , if you have a <unk> , it 's not a <unk> , it 's easy choice that would be better . And that 's that 's what it 's going to <unk> us to <unk> us to <unk> us to <unk> , and the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> , and the decision , and the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> ,
And it was a <unk> decision .
The more choices are , it 's easy to <unk> any <unk> that is <unk> of <unk> .
<unk> , there is what <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Dan <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , very good as the value that we <unk> to things from what we <unk> .
<unk> , when there are many <unk> , it 's easy to <unk> the <unk> of <unk> <unk> and be less than the <unk> <unk> that it 's choice .
Here 's a example . I 'm going to all the those who are not in New York .
But it 's what we probably <unk> .
There 's this <unk> <unk> .
A place of <unk> .
<unk> <unk> . <unk> day . It 's all about them .
It 's not <unk> . But that he think , " Well , <unk> , it 's <unk> . "
I all my <unk> are on <unk> . "
" <unk> <unk> <unk> right in front of the home . "
And it 's two weeks from the idea that 's <unk> -- every day -- the chance of <unk> where it wants .
The <unk> <unk> <unk> for that we have , even when the choice was <unk> .
And the most <unk> that we have from <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Here 's another example .
This <unk> <unk> says a lot of things .
We 're talking about the <unk> , and maybe in the live .
But the most important is that any thing you 're going to be <unk> , you 're not going to do the other .
The things that we don 't have a lot of <unk> that can make less <unk> what we do .
<unk> <unk> .
I tried to my skin <unk> a new couple of <unk> .
It 's almost <unk> .
And one time , they were <unk> , they were <unk> , and <unk> <unk> , they were <unk> , only after <unk> , they were <unk> a lot of times , <unk> to go .
So , I went to <unk> a couple of when the <unk> were <unk> , and I said , " I need a couple of <unk> , this is my <unk> . "
<unk> said , " You want to <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> ? "
You want them to <unk> or <unk> ? " <unk> , " <unk> , " <unk> , " <unk> ? "
" <unk> them wants ? "
" <unk> <unk> them , or <unk> ? <unk> <unk> <unk> -- " <unk> <unk> <unk> .
I was <unk> , and after a little bit of <unk> , I 'm going to say , " I want the only one . " He didn 't know what it was , so that for a <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> , with the <unk> <unk> , with the best <unk> , I had ever <unk> that .
It was the <unk> . <unk> all the best .
But I 'm going to be <unk> .
Why ? I wrote a book for <unk> .
The reason I was going to know , it 's all the choice of my <unk> were <unk> .
I had <unk> <unk> . I didn 't have <unk> <unk> . I 'm not going to <unk> . But when we have 100 different , <unk> , at least one one was a kind of <unk> .
What I had <unk> was good , but not perfect .
After <unk> what I was <unk> with what I was <unk> in <unk> .
The <unk> of <unk> in life , not that <unk> <unk> that these <unk> <unk> that these <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And that 's <unk> less <unk> , even when the results are good .
<unk> in the world of the <unk> , if you know .
Because if you know , I 'm not going to do that .
The truth of the <unk> .
" It was better when it was going to say , " The reason that 's better when it was better as we were better as we were <unk> .
<unk> , in the world we live -- <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> that we can <unk> is that things are <unk> .
You 've never never <unk> <unk> because your <unk> , you know , my <unk> , you know , my <unk> .
The <unk> of happiness -- that you 're here -- that 's , " <unk> <unk> " Yeah , " Yeah , you know , " Yeah , you know . "
I mean -- small <unk> <unk> -- that I 'm really <unk> and my wife is really <unk> .
I could not have to do better , I 'm not <unk> .
But it 's not a <unk> .
<unk> , a <unk> of you can buy a couple of <unk> when there 's just that kind of <unk> is that when you 're not <unk> , and you say , " Why ? "
" Who is <unk> ? " " " <unk> is <unk> .
The world is the <unk> . What I could you do it ?
When they 're hundreds of <unk> , and you get a <unk> , and you get a <unk> , and you 're <unk> who 's <unk> , it 's clear that the <unk> you .
I could do better .
With hundreds of <unk> available , there are not <unk> for <unk> .
So when people do , even if the result is <unk> , you know , you <unk> and <unk> their <unk> to them .
In the last years , the <unk> world .
I think a <unk> <unk> -- not the only , but important -- that 's not the only , but -- of this <unk> <unk> is that people have been <unk> <unk> .
And when they have to think that the <unk> is that their <unk> is .
So the end of the final is that we 're better , but we 're going to be <unk> .
I 'm going to tell you .
This is the <unk> <unk> , what all of we all take for good and it 's completely <unk> . It 's not true .
There 's no <unk> that a little choice that 's better than not <unk> , but from this not <unk> , but from this not <unk> that much choice is better .
There 's a <unk> , <unk> . I don 't know what it 's .
But I 'm sure we 've got <unk> from a piece of the level of the <unk> ,
Now , from the <unk> <unk> -- I 've been <unk> -- from the point of view , the <unk> is the <unk> .
What it <unk> is the <unk> <unk> , it 's <unk> material .
There are many places in the world , and you know , you know , the problem is not that they have <unk> .
The problem is that they have too <unk> .
So the <unk> I 'm talking about is a <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> society .
And that 's that <unk> and <unk> is this : <unk> <unk> you about how <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> for <unk> . It 's a <unk> of money . It 's a <unk> of money .
I mean that these choices , <unk> and <unk> , it 's not that they 're just <unk> .
They 're <unk> .
They do it better .
If a little bit of what we think in our society <unk> <unk> , it was <unk> in those where people have too a lot of <unk> , it would not just be their life , but we also have our life .
This is what <unk> <unk> <unk> .
One of the income , it 's good to all of the poor -- because of this choice in <unk> that we <unk> .
So , I said , " You can be all the things you want to --
<unk> , people , <unk> , <unk> : " But what do that fish ? "
" It 's <unk> that you can 't make anything in a <unk> of the glass . "
" A <unk> <unk> , a <unk> view of the world -- "
And I <unk> , I <unk> this , at the beginning .
But then , <unk> , instead , I realized that fish knows that fish knows that fish knows .
Because the reality of the <unk> is that if you can <unk> the <unk> , in the way , you can 't <unk> the freedom .
If you <unk> the <unk> in the way that everything we can <unk> the <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , and <unk> the <unk> .
Everybody need a <unk> .
This is almost <unk> , maybe it 's even for the fish , and it 's <unk> for us .
But the <unk> of some <unk> <unk> is a <unk> for <unk> and <unk> , for <unk> .
Thank you .
