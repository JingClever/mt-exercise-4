The last year I showed these <unk> for <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , which for almost three million years had had the <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> percent .
So , we <unk> the <unk> of the problem because it 's not <unk> the ice <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> <unk> is , in a sense , the heart of climate system .
It <unk> <unk> and <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
The next <unk> will be a <unk> <unk> on the last 25 years .
The <unk> <unk> are <unk> in red .
How you see , you can see it down to the blue <unk> .
That 's the ice in <unk> , which is <unk> in summer .
You can see that the ice <unk> ice , of five years or more , it 's like the blood blood , which here <unk> from the body .
In 25 years , it 's been so , in the way .
This is a problem because the <unk> are <unk> in the <unk> around the ocean where there are huge <unk> of <unk> that , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
<unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> of global <unk> , that amount of <unk> , that you can 't <unk> .
In some <unk> , <unk> <unk> is already <unk> by the water .
The <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> ! <unk> : <unk> it 's good . The question is if you 're going to be <unk> .
So , this is that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> from the <unk> .
This is a river to <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> had never <unk> <unk> <unk> .
This is the <unk> river , in the <unk> of the <unk> .
If you want to know how the <unk> level of the <unk> <unk> on <unk> , here is where the sea .
These are <unk> are <unk> .
<unk> other side of the planet : <unk> , the most big <unk> of ice ice <unk> on the planet .
The last month , the scientists have <unk> that the <unk> of ice is in <unk> , and that <unk> <unk> , is particularly <unk> in the <unk> .
<unk> at six feet of the <unk> level , like in <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , the most big <unk> of ice , you see new <unk> , which few years ago , they were <unk> .
The 40 percent of the world population <unk> <unk> from the water from that <unk> .
<unk> <unk> : this <unk> is the source of water <unk> of this city .
The <unk> is <unk> .
But when you <unk> , it 's the same thing is going to <unk> water .
In California , <unk> on the <unk> <unk> is <unk> 40 percent .
The <unk> <unk> are in crisis .
The <unk> , as you have read , they 're <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> in the world 's door to a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> are <unk> to a <unk> out of the normal and without <unk> .
<unk> times more <unk> in the last 30 years than the <unk> <unk> .
This is a <unk> of the <unk> all <unk> .
If you look at the context context , you can see the <unk> context .
In the last five years , we 've <unk> <unk> million <unk> of <unk> every day .
Look at the <unk> area , from <unk> , from <unk> , and on both the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , where there 's a <unk> <unk> of oxygen in the ocean .
The most <unk> because of global global <unk> , <unk> , which is 20 percent , is the use of <unk> <unk> .
The oil is a problem , and the <unk> is even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even .
The United States is one of the two countries with the <unk> <unk> , together .
And it 's <unk> to build a lot of other <unk> .
But we 're <unk> to a <unk> of the direction .
These are the <unk> projects in the last years and some <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
And then , there 's a <unk> politics in our country .
The <unk> of the <unk> and oil <unk> <unk> million dollars in the last year to <unk> <unk> , which is a <unk> .
I 'm going to <unk> me something --
<unk> <unk> , in <unk> , where live , there was a <unk> of <unk> billion <unk> of <unk> .
Maybe you 've seen it on the <unk> .
This is the <unk> <unk> in America .
It 's happened around <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> of one of the <unk> of <unk> was this .
<unk> : <unk> ♫ ♫ <unk> is a kind of <unk> and happy .
It 's <unk> here in America , and it 's going to <unk> in America .
<unk> the <unk> is more <unk> .
It 's a good price , <unk> and the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> here is a lot of the <unk> <unk> .
The most big society on the <unk> is <unk> . This is his <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> : <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> -- not know what they 're talking about .
<unk> : So the <unk> for the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> has two <unk> .
This is a one of them , a part .
<unk> : <unk> : <unk> <unk> , we see the <unk> changes as a <unk> <unk> to our business .
So , our <unk> is <unk> a big amount of money in a <unk> <unk> to make public public and <unk> the truth on the <unk> .
In fact , the <unk> is not <unk> .
We think it 's <unk> -- it 's also a good <unk> .
So , not <unk> of climate change .
We 're going to do it .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> : <unk> <unk> -- you 've heard a lot of a lot .
So , I 'm going to <unk> a structure of <unk> <unk> .
<unk> ! The machines are a little bit <unk> , but that 's the sound of the technology of the <unk> of the <unk> technology .
The <unk> of <unk> is <unk> between the <unk> of global global <unk> , but the technology technology of <unk> that you see changes all .
You look at a look at this is the <unk> technology .
<unk> : <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to the economic question and <unk> of national security .
<unk> : <unk> , America is in crisis ; the <unk> , national crisis , the <unk> crisis .
The <unk> that <unk> all : our <unk> from the <unk> <unk> , like <unk> <unk> and oil <unk> .
Now , there 's a new , <unk> solution to <unk> .
<unk> America : 100 percent of energy , in 10 years .
A <unk> , <unk> America to work , more <unk> , <unk> , and to help <unk> global <unk> .
<unk> , a solution that we <unk> to solve our problems .
<unk> America . <unk> .
<unk> : This is the last .
<unk> : <unk> : It 's <unk> energy to America .
One of the most <unk> ways of <unk> <unk> , <unk> that <unk> our planet planet .
<unk> : The future is here . <unk> , the sun , a new <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> two : <unk> <unk> for work .
<unk> : <unk> America . It 's time to be <unk> .
<unk> <unk> : A old <unk> <unk> says , " If you want to go to it , just just just <unk> , you go from it .
If you want to go , you go back , you go . "
We have to go away , quickly .
Thank you very much .
The last year I got a <unk> on the <unk> .
And I 'm going to <unk> to <unk> on how the car works .
So , <unk> here . And for the other time , there were not , the <unk> is the largest <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> is to <unk> the conditions that were <unk> less than a <unk> of the beginning of the universe -- to <unk> million times a second .
All that 's just <unk> .
This is the car <unk> .
We <unk> these <unk> <unk> in the <unk> .
This is what I work . It 's called <unk> -- it 's <unk> feet and has a <unk> <unk> feet .
This is a <unk> image of <unk> in building so you can see the <unk> .
The 10 <unk> of last year we 've <unk> the first time .
And this picture was <unk> by <unk> .
It was because of <unk> <unk> in the <unk> in the <unk> of control .
It 's an image of the first <unk> of <unk> particles that had done the <unk> of the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , with a part of the <unk> , and <unk> particles in the <unk> .
In other words , when I <unk> that image the <unk> <unk> , <unk> that the <unk> machine , which is a big <unk> .
I don 't know if it was this <unk> to <unk> more or this , when somebody <unk> on Google and <unk> that the <unk> <unk> was this .
That means we 've had a <unk> impact on the scientific <unk> .
<unk> a week after , there was a problem with the car , we had to be <unk> here -- these <unk> <unk> .
These <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Now , the <unk> between you <unk> the <unk> and <unk> , " It 's not true . They 're too <unk> . "
And instead can do it because when they 're very <unk> <unk> <unk> .
So , at least <unk> degrees , to a <unk> temperature temperature <unk> , and <unk> can bring that <unk> .
In one of the <unk> between the most <unk> <unk> in the <unk> , there was a <unk> of <unk> .
So the <unk> <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
This was the result .
Now , that 's more <unk> if you think that these <unk> <unk> <unk> more than 20 <unk> , and that 's <unk> about 30 <unk> .
They 're <unk> about 50 <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , what we did .
We <unk> and <unk> and <unk> .
Now , they 're all <unk> to their <unk> .
We <unk> the end of <unk> the <unk> will be new <unk> .
The <unk> , and we <unk> to get to <unk> data or <unk> , and <unk> so our <unk> to find out what the <unk> are the <unk> that <unk> the universe .
Now , of course , in a way , these <unk> <unk> the <unk> of science and <unk> of <unk> . It 's easy to <unk> .
I think that the fact that it 's so hard , the fact , the <unk> , I think it 's the value of things like the <unk> .
I 'd like to <unk> with the words of a <unk> <unk> , <unk> , which , in <unk> <unk> experiments of <unk> experiments , his <unk> was <unk> , his <unk> was <unk> , said , " It 's no <unk> for the human mind that the <unk> of the human mind that the <unk> of the <unk> of science , that are <unk> <unk> .
Thank you .
I want to start <unk> to <unk> , when children , <unk> <unk> .
As <unk> <unk> and <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , actually , <unk> and <unk> , <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> is <unk> <unk> to the way that <unk> most of the world around us .
So , from <unk> <unk> from the <unk> of our <unk> with <unk> objects , and <unk> <unk> <unk> , and my <unk> <unk> <unk> , I started <unk> , I started <unk> , " And if you use a computer , instead of a computer , instead of <unk> <unk> how to have the <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> <unk> , and <unk> with <unk> , and then , with <unk> <unk> , with <unk> <unk> <unk> ,
and <unk> to our <unk> ?
The question was so interesting that we <unk> to explore the answer , building <unk> .
In a few words , a <unk> , a <unk> computer as a <unk> .
In a few words , a <unk> , a <unk> computer as a <unk> .
You can <unk> with the hand , they can <unk> " between them , " <unk> " between them , " <unk> " between them , " and a <unk> <unk> .
But <unk> , they 're <unk> objects , like <unk> , you can just <unk> .
The <unk> are the example of a new <unk> of tools for <unk> information information .
And as as a <unk> that become more <unk> , <unk> of the <unk> , of the other , and they become more <unk> , <unk> of the <unk> movement , the other , of how we can explore them , and <unk> <unk> of <unk> .
We 're going to <unk> with some simple example .
This <unk> is <unk> to show you the video : if you <unk> it in a direction , the <unk> video so , if you <unk> the other <unk> .
These <unk> <unk> are <unk> <unk> .
If you <unk> , you <unk> , you <unk> them to what they are around .
If they <unk> , you can <unk> it , and they can <unk> a little bit .
If they <unk> , you can <unk> it , and they can <unk> a little bit .
They also <unk> their movement and <unk> .
We <unk> that one of the interesting <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> was that we can use <unk> <unk> on the <unk> data , for example , " <unk> a <unk> .
In this case , we have three <unk> <unk> like <unk> and I can <unk> to <unk> of the color in the <unk> , where you 're <unk> .
and I can <unk> to <unk> the color in the <unk> , where you 're <unk> .
If you can <unk> it , we can <unk> a little place .
I 'm also <unk> to be <unk> <unk> , like <unk> , the mathematics and games where people can try things things to try things things , and <unk> the results .
Now , I 'm --
This is a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Here we have a <unk> <unk> , which is half of the <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> , at every <unk> <unk> a <unk> , <unk> a <unk> , <unk> , to every <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> a letter to <unk> a <unk> .
And then , after about 30 seconds , and you have a new <unk> and new <unk> and new <unk> and new <unk> to try .
Thank you .
Here 's the children <unk> in <unk> <unk> , I did that in the <unk> , I 've got a video .
They 're very very much .
And one of the interesting things that 's that you don 't have to <unk> people .
<unk> just say , " <unk> words , " and they know what to do .
Here 's there other people who are <unk> .
This is our <unk> <unk> , there 's the <unk> <unk> , there 's right .
It wanted to be <unk> .
They were just <unk> , for him .
Now , this is an <unk> of a <unk> <unk> .
<unk> building a <unk> for the <unk> of the <unk> , he 's <unk> .
It can <unk> new characters in the <unk> , <unk> their <unk> .
It can <unk> new characters in the <unk> , <unk> their <unk> .
So , that 's doing the sun .
<unk> : The sun is <unk> .
David <unk> : Now , he has <unk> a <unk> in the <unk> .
<unk> : The <unk> <unk> .
<unk> work !
So , we <unk> the <unk> and <unk> can make the <unk> <unk> --
<unk> : <unk> !
<unk> their story .
<unk> : <unk> !
<unk> : It 's a story with the final story , and it can decide it .
<unk> : It 's a story with the final story , and it can decide it .
<unk> : <unk> on , <unk> .
<unk> : The last example I have the last example of you are a <unk> , by <unk> and <unk> music .
is a tool , <unk> , for <unk> and <unk> music .
The <unk> here <unk> <unk> <unk> like , <unk> , and the <unk> .
<unk> of these have four different <unk> , and you can have to use .
You can also <unk> these <unk> in a <unk> <unk> .
And I just <unk> just doing <unk> a <unk> sound and a <unk> . "
These are actually , that you can control from the live , like the <unk> and the <unk> .
We <unk> it to a particular sound and then <unk> for <unk> .
And then there are the fact , you have a time and <unk> , that 's <unk> to the whole <unk> .
<unk> like it works .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> : <unk> a <unk> in two <unk> " <unk> , " <unk> in a series , the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
Now , you 'll see a <unk> line .
<unk> : Now , I 'm going to <unk> <unk> --
<unk> : <unk> : And now I 'm going to <unk> the <unk> , so I can control the <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> : I can <unk> the whole time from one side or another .
<unk> : <unk> : <unk> . And now we <unk> the <unk> to give more <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> : I can <unk> the <unk> <unk> . "
So I don 't have to <unk> before , but I can <unk> , <unk> , more <unk> or more <unk> .
And now , finally , I can <unk> the whole <unk> <unk> <unk> on the left <unk> " . "
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is to build new <unk> <unk> , and more <unk> to how our brain and body .
And today , I 've had time to show you one of the results of this , and also some <unk> that we 're trying to get out from the <unk> .
The concept that I want to <unk> is that we 're <unk> this new generation of objects for <unk> with the <unk> <unk> , that we want to <unk> information in our world in our world world we want .
Thank you very much .
I don 't see the now now , I don 't see the now .
They 're a <unk> .
<unk> books is my <unk> , but it 's more than this , of course .
It 's also love and the <unk> of my life .
And I don 't know what it can change .
But , said , this , something particular is <unk> in my life and in my career , and in my career , which has <unk> me to <unk> the entire <unk> with this work .
The particular thing is that I <unk> wrote this book , this <unk> called " <unk> , " which , " which , " which <unk> <unk> , " which , " which <unk> from my <unk> and <unk> , <unk> .
And the result is that <unk> now , people <unk> me like if I was <unk> .
<unk> -- <unk> , <unk> , <unk> !
<unk> to me now , I 'm going to say , " You don 't know , you 're not going to do better ?
You don 't know , you don 't know , life without more able to make a book that can <unk> to somebody ? "
What can you <unk> to somebody ? "
It 's <unk> , you know .
But it could go worse , and I remember the most of 20 years ago , when I was going to say , people -- I was a <unk> -- I was a <unk> .
I 'm going to go to the same <unk> <unk> .
And people said , " Don 't <unk> to be able to have success ?
You don 't think the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> you ?
You don 't know that <unk> for all the life without anything is going to ever come out and die on a <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> with the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> ? "
So , you know .
The answer -- the short answer to all these questions is , " Yeah . "
You know , I 'm <unk> all those things .
I always had been <unk> .
And I also also think of many other things that people don 't have <unk> .
How the <unk> and other things .
But , for how do it is to write what I thought and <unk> is why ?
Is it <unk> ?
It 's <unk> that anybody who <unk> <unk> to be <unk> by a job that you feel born for it .
But what 's so particular in the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> about health health health health <unk> in a way that other <unk> don 't it ?
How do my father , for example , he was a <unk> <unk> and I 'm not going to be <unk> , and I 'm not going to be <unk> ?
There was never -- that <unk> of the <unk> John , how do it ?
<unk> 't it , <unk> ?
<unk> , the engineers <unk> like a group of course , in the <unk> of being <unk> <unk> .
We <unk> , we have enough this <unk> , and not only <unk> , but we 're going to <unk> , and we have this <unk> of being <unk> <unk> .
And they don 't want to look at the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> that , only in the <unk> century , <unk> young and often for them .
And also the ones that 's not <unk> to be <unk> by their <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , before I die , in the last <unk> said , " Every my book , he <unk> me a little bit more " <unk> about the work of their life .
But we didn 't <unk> when we say , because we 've heard these things so much as a way we 've got this <unk> and <unk> the <unk> that creativity and <unk> are in some way and <unk> , and the art , at the end , and the art , to <unk> .
And the question I want to <unk> to all here is : you 're going to <unk> this idea ?
You 'll go to this thing -- because it 's also <unk> to me not good for anything .
I think it 's <unk> .
And I think it 's also <unk> and I don 't want to <unk> in the next century .
I think it 's better <unk> our big <unk> to live .
And I know , I know , in my case -- it would be very <unk> to start to <unk> to <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in which I 'm in my career .
<unk> -- look at it , look at , I 'm pretty young , I have about 40 years .
I still have about four <unk> of work in me .
And it 's very <unk> that any <unk> of the <unk> now will be <unk> from the world as the work that <unk> happened after the <unk> of my last book .
<unk> <unk> , because we 're all more or less friends here -- is <unk> that my big big happened to my <unk> .
Oh , <unk> , who thought !
You know this is the kind of thinking that <unk> a person to start <unk> to <unk> at the nine of the morning and I don 't want it .
I 'm going to go to do this work that I love .
So the question becomes , it becomes , how ?
And so it seems to me , after many <unk> , that the way to work is what to create a <unk> <unk> <unk> , right ?
I have to have to find a <unk> of <unk> between me , which I 'm <unk> , and the natural <unk> <unk> on what <unk> <unk> <unk> . And as I 'm going to get to look at the last year models on how to do do to look at the time , and then , to find more <unk> ideas , if you have a better ideas and more <unk> ideas and more <unk> and more <unk> and more <unk> and more <unk> and more <unk> and more <unk> and more <unk> <unk> and more
about how to help people <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> of creativity .
And that research has <unk> me to <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> because they 're going to go back and then <unk> back .
<unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> -- people don 't believe that creativity <unk> of men , OK ?
It <unk> that creativity was this <unk> spirit and <unk> and <unk> to the men from a few <unk> and <unk> , for <unk> and <unk> , for <unk> and <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> <unk> these <unk> <unk> of creativity , " <unk> . "
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> were the same idea , but <unk> that species of the spirit without a <unk> .
The <unk> is <unk> , because the <unk> didn 't really really <unk> that a <unk> was somebody who are particularly a <unk> <unk> .
<unk> that was a <unk> was this kind of <unk> <unk> that <unk> literally <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk> of a <unk> , and that <unk> <unk> to <unk> the work of <unk> the <unk> of <unk> the work of <unk> the <unk> and <unk> the result of the work .
<unk> <unk> <unk> , that 's the <unk> of what I 'm talking about -- that <unk> you <unk> that <unk> you from the <unk> of your work .
And all <unk> that was so <unk> , right ?
So , artists were <unk> from <unk> things , like example , like example , for example , right ?
If your work was <unk> not <unk> <unk> all the <unk> , all of <unk> that <unk> was <unk> by this <unk> <unk> .
If your work , it was not all your <unk> , right ?
All of <unk> that was your <unk> to be a <unk> .
And so the people <unk> <unk> creativity in <unk> for a long time .
And then the <unk> <unk> and all <unk> , and <unk> this big idea ; we put the human <unk> of the universe , the human <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> space .
This was the principle of <unk> <unk> and people to think that creativity is completely completely <unk> from <unk> .
And for the first time in the story , <unk> to <unk> this or that artist as a rather <unk> <unk> to a rather <unk> person with the <unk> .
And I have to <unk> , I think it was a big big .
I think I think I think that I would be like to be like a <unk> like a <unk> , the <unk> and the <unk> of all the <unk> <unk> , <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> is a <unk> <unk> .
It 's like to <unk> somebody of <unk> the sun .
<unk> and <unk> and <unk> the <unk> and create all these <unk> <unk> on the <unk> .
And I think it was this pressure to have <unk> artists in <unk> 500 years .
And if this is true , and I think it 's the question , it becomes , and now ?
Can we do it ?
You can go back to a more understanding of the relationship between human human <unk> and <unk> .
Or maybe no .
Maybe we can 't <unk> 500 years of thinking in a <unk> <unk> of 18 minutes .
And there 's probably people in the audience that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , you <unk> , you <unk> , you <unk> people <unk> <unk> <unk> on their projects .
You can 't be <unk> you all about this thing .
But the question I want to <unk> is -- why ?
Why don 't it <unk> in this way ?
Because it has more sense of every other thing that has ever heard to explain the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> process .
A process that , as anybody who ever <unk> to do something -- so , we 're all here -- so , you know , you know , you know , you know , it 's not <unk> <unk> .
And , in fact , it can be completely <unk> .
I 've done this <unk> <unk> with the extraordinary <unk> <unk> , which has now now , years , but that was a <unk> <unk> for all the life and said that during his <unk> in the <unk> <unk> , <unk> out of the <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> it , in the <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> , in the <unk> , if if you <unk> <unk> .
He said that it was like a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And that <unk> <unk> to her from the <unk> .
They <unk> it , because he <unk> the <unk> on the Earth .
<unk> to have one thing to do that , and it was , words , " <unk> like a <unk> . "
And so I <unk> to home and it was <unk> by this <unk> , and it didn 't have to get another piece of paper and a <unk> enough <unk> , and a little bit <unk> , and <unk> on the <unk> .
<unk> times , I didn 't get enough , so <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> without able to get home and <unk> and she would <unk> it and she would <unk> to <unk> through the <unk> and she would <unk> to <unk> through the <unk> , and she would <unk> . "
And then there were the other -- this piece of never -- there were the moments where the <unk> was almost <unk> , right ?
So , he was <unk> to home and he was trying to <unk> and the <unk> through , and <unk> a <unk> <unk> in the <unk> , and he said , and then he was like , and then he was like if you <unk> with the other hand and <unk> .
<unk> the <unk> from the tail and the <unk> in his body and the <unk> on the page .
And in these cases , the <unk> would be <unk> on the <unk> and <unk> , but at the last word at the first .
So when you <unk> <unk> -- it 's <unk> , it 's <unk> , it 's just <unk> to my <unk> process .
I 'm not a <unk> process -- I 'm not a <unk> !
I 'm a <unk> , and my way to <unk> is ; it 's <unk> every day and <unk> and work and work and work and work and work and <unk> on the <unk> .
But even I even , in my <unk> , I <unk> against that what , sometimes .
And I 'm going to <unk> that also many of you the <unk> .
You know , even if the work and ideas I <unk> <unk> to me from a certain source of <unk> , I can <unk> <unk> .
And what is this ?
And how can we <unk> to do it in it , but rather , rather , rather , which <unk> <unk> <unk> ?
So , I 'm going to be <unk> for the best example I have a <unk> <unk> <unk> , which I <unk> different years ago for a <unk> .
<unk> talking about this , and you know , <unk> , for the <unk> of life was the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , trying to control , <unk> these <unk> <unk> , <unk> these species of <unk> <unk> .
But then <unk> , <unk> , and a day , and and a day , and and a day , and he was <unk> <unk> , <unk> everything for him .
<unk> , <unk> and all of a <unk> <unk> this little <unk> of <unk> , which comes in his head as <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> , and the <unk> , you know , it 's wonderful , and <unk> , but it 's not how to <unk> .
It 's no piece of paper , he didn 't have a <unk> , it 's not a <unk> .
So , it starts to feel this kind of old <unk> to grow in him , " I 'm going to <unk> , and <unk> <unk> from this song .
I 'm not <unk> enough and I can 't <unk> . "
And instead of go in the <unk> , <unk> .
<unk> the whole process of <unk> and did something new .
<unk> just the sky and said , " <unk> , you don 't see that I 'm <unk> ? "
" You know , it seems to write a song now ?
If you really want to <unk> , I 'm going to get to <unk> it .
<unk> , <unk> to <unk> <unk> another today .
<unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> . "
And his <unk> process after this .
It didn 't work , the work was still <unk> like always .
But the process , and the <unk> <unk> that was <unk> when I <unk> the <unk> , the <unk> that was going to go back from him , and the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , which was <unk> <unk> <unk> , which was not a <unk> and <unk> .
But <unk> this <unk> , wonderful <unk> <unk> a conversation between <unk> and this thing and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> that was not <unk> .
So how <unk> that story to change a little bit about the way I <unk> and I 'm <unk> and already <unk> me once .
This idea , I <unk> me when I was <unk> " <unk> , " and I 'm going to <unk> , " and I 'm going to be in a something and we 're going to be going to be a <unk> , and you can think that it 's going to be a <unk> , which is going to be <unk> , which the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
It 's not just <unk> , just the <unk> book .
And I started thinking about this project .
But then I <unk> to <unk> that <unk> to the air and <unk> .
So I <unk> my face in the <unk> and <unk> my <unk> to a <unk> <unk> of the room .
And I said , " <unk> , " <unk> , " <unk> , what if this book is not going to be <unk> <unk> , no <unk> , no ?
Because you see I 'm going to show it all I , I don 't have more than this .
So if you want it to be better , you have to <unk> and do your part .
OK . But if you don 't do it , you know , I 'm not going to <unk> .
I 'm going to write the same because it 's my work .
And I want to <unk> that was <unk> that I 'm <unk> to do my <unk> , " because -- it 's so , it 's so , <unk> -- <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> , and <unk> music that <unk> to <unk> and music that <unk> to <unk> hours to <unk> and <unk> and <unk> ,
And they were always <unk> , because the <unk> were <unk> and were <unk> .
But every <unk> , something <unk> , something <unk> , and one of these artists <unk> actually <unk> .
And I know , I know , because I know , because I know that you 've seen , at a <unk> .
It was like if the time , you know , and the <unk> <unk> through a kind of <unk> and it was not a different <unk> from , like the <unk> <unk> <unk> before , but it 's all <unk> .
And at a sudden , you don 't just like a human human .
But it 's <unk> and from the <unk> and <unk> in the <unk> <unk> .
And when this <unk> , the time , people <unk> what was , and people <unk> what was , and the <unk> .
<unk> and <unk> to <unk> , " <unk> , " <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , God , " God , " God , "
That 's God , you know .
<unk> <unk> -- when the <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> this <unk> <unk> , <unk> this <unk> with them and the <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> , " <unk> , " <unk> , " <unk> , " <unk> , " <unk> , " <unk> , " <unk> , " which you can see in the <unk> or <unk> or <unk> .
In <unk> , when a <unk> , he did something impossible and <unk> , " <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , " <unk> , " <unk> , " <unk> , " <unk> , " <unk> , " <unk> .
And it 's <unk> because we need .
But , the problem comes to the day , after , for the <unk> , when you <unk> and <unk> that are 11 of <unk> and <unk> <unk> . And I 'm <unk> , there 's no more .
It 's just a <unk> with a lot of <unk> to <unk> , and maybe not <unk> to that <unk> <unk> .
And maybe one <unk> the name of God still , as <unk> , and what 's going to do with the rest of his life ?
It 's hard .
This is one of the most <unk> <unk> to do in a <unk> life .
But maybe it 's not to be <unk> , if you can 't believe , <unk> , that the most <unk> of your <unk> are from you .
But I just just <unk> you are data in <unk> from a <unk> of this <unk> part of your life that 's going to go to <unk> it .
And , you know , if we think about this way .
And so I started <unk> , and it 's a <unk> for different months during the <unk> of the book that I was <unk> to <unk> , the <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
And what I have to go to <unk> when I feel <unk> from this is , I feel <unk> .
<unk> .
<unk> to <unk> for your part , any , can be .
If your work is <unk> , <unk> .
If the <unk> , you <unk> , you will <unk> to <unk> <unk> some kind of <unk> , for a moment through your <unk> , so , " <unk> ! "
<unk> , you can do it , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you can do it .
And " <unk> ! " You know , " you know , " <unk> ! "
I think , and I think it 's <unk> <unk> .
" <unk> ! " You know , " <unk> ! "
Thank you .
Thank you .
<unk> <unk> : <unk> !
How I 've already talked about some of these projects on the human genome , on what can <unk> and <unk> new <unk> of genes .
Now , we 're <unk> a new way : we started <unk> biology and now , and now , to start <unk> in a new <unk> of biology , <unk> and <unk> life .
We 've always tried to <unk> great questions .
" <unk> is life ? " is something that many <unk> I think they 're going to <unk> to understand <unk> .
We tried different <unk> , <unk> to <unk> terms of the <unk> terms .
We 're <unk> by almost 20 years .
When we <unk> the human genome is <unk> to go from the <unk> of biology in the digital world of the computer .
Now , we <unk> us : we <unk> life , or create new life from this digital universe ?
This is the map of a little <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , which is the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> that can <unk> in the lab .
And we tried to <unk> the genome for <unk> a <unk> , more <unk> .
We can be able to <unk> a <unk> of genes of about 500 <unk> that are .
But when we take a look at its <unk> map , is simple than our <unk> .
<unk> , this is simple .
But when we look at all the genes that we can <unk> , one at one , is very <unk> that can take a <unk> cell <unk> .
So , I <unk> that the only one on <unk> <unk> , so that <unk> <unk> the <unk> for some of these questions .
So we started the <unk> of the " We can <unk> a <unk> ? "
Is it the <unk> <unk> of produce these big molecules that we never have to create before we 've never been doing before we 've never been doing before we are now ?
And , in case , <unk> , we can make a <unk> ?
A <unk> is just a piece of <unk> material .
The speed with we are able to <unk> life life is <unk> <unk> .
Our ability to write the code , instead , instead , rather <unk> , but it 's <unk> .
And our most <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> .
We <unk> more than 15 years ago .
The process has <unk> a lot of <unk> , <unk> with a <unk> <unk> before we <unk> the first experiments .
But we found that <unk> is very difficult .
There are <unk> of thousands of machines , the world that <unk> little <unk> , of <unk> <unk> , of <unk> , and it 's a <unk> process : the most <unk> is a <unk> , more <unk> .
So we had to develop a new <unk> for <unk> these <unk> and <unk> the <unk> .
And this was our first <unk> , to <unk> , to <unk> <unk> <unk> .
It 's a little virus that <unk> bacteria .
We <unk> the <unk> , <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> and <unk> a <unk> of DNA <unk> .
The interesting part is when we 've got this piece of material <unk> <unk> and we <unk> it in the bacteria , the bacteria have <unk> to read this code code and <unk> <unk> particles .
The <unk> particles are <unk> by cells , they 're <unk> back and they <unk> the <unk> <unk> .
I talked about the <unk> of <unk> industry that they have of course , that they have <unk> this model .
They have more than you .
So , I think this is a situation where the software can actually build its same <unk> in a <unk> system .
But I 'll be <unk> things in the big .
We 're going to build the <unk> of the <unk> .
They 're more than <unk> <unk> <unk> code .
So we thought of <unk> in the size of the virus , so that we can change the <unk> to understand what the <unk> of a <unk> cell .
The <unk> is <unk> , and if you <unk> information in a computer , these are to be very <unk> .
When I <unk> this genome for the first time in the <unk> <unk> was a <unk> for every 10 <unk> <unk> .
We found , <unk> , 30 <unk> . If you <unk> that original <unk> <unk> never been able to do it .
One of the process is <unk> <unk> 50 <unk> <unk> that <unk> with all the other <unk> of 50 <unk> to build <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> here .
You have to see that <unk> <unk> .
<unk> so : we have a <unk> code on four <unk> : <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> of those <unk> <unk> together , about 20 <unk> , and there 's a <unk> <unk> for every <unk> .
So we can use the <unk> code for <unk> words , <unk> , <unk> .
What we 've done at the beginning was <unk> .
Some of the fact that it was not <unk> .
We 've designed these <unk> to <unk> just <unk> <unk> .
There are <unk> that we <unk> them and <unk> them .
And we started <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
We 've got this <unk> , we 've got these <unk> in <unk> <unk> that we 're <unk> to create a very <unk> <unk> <unk> as you 'll see in a minute .
We 're trying to <unk> the process .
So , this seems the <unk> of a <unk> of <unk> .
When I <unk> to these very <unk> , more than 100 <unk> <unk> , not <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> .
It 's <unk> to the <unk> tools of biology .
So we <unk> other <unk> .
<unk> of another <unk> called <unk> <unk> , which is <unk> <unk> , which is <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> .
Here 's a example .
This <unk> , called <unk> <unk> , can <unk> three million <unk> <unk> .
You can see in the <unk> <unk> , as his <unk> is <unk> .
In 12 hours , it 's <unk> exactly how it was before .
<unk> thousands of organisms that are able to do it .
These organisms can <unk> completely .
We 're going to live in <unk> .
They 're absolutely absolutely sure life <unk> in space , and you 're <unk> to find new <unk> of water .
And so , NASA has showed that this is .
This is an image of the <unk> that we built using these <unk> , just using the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> them <unk> .
This image was not <unk> with a <unk> <unk> , but with a <unk> <unk> .
It 's a <unk> so big that we can <unk> with a <unk> <unk> .
These are <unk> that <unk> a time of about six seconds .
This is the <unk> we 've done a long time ago .
They 're more than <unk> <unk> code .
It 's the most big <unk> of a <unk> structure , ever <unk> from the man .
It 's a <unk> <unk> to 300 million .
If you <unk> it with a <unk> 10 without <unk> , we <unk> <unk> <unk> pages for this code .
Now , how do we do it ? How can we <unk> ?
Of course , with a virus is a <unk> game .
It 's a little bit more <unk> when you use .
It 's more simple as well when it 's about cells as our : you can just <unk> the <unk> and <unk> another , which is that 's <unk> <unk> .
In <unk> <unk> , <unk> the <unk> is instead of <unk> in the cell , but we <unk> <unk> that we are able to do a <unk> <unk> of a <unk> cell from a cell cell to another and <unk> .
We <unk> a <unk> <unk> from a kind of <unk> .
The two are different than men from the <unk> .
We <unk> some <unk> in the more <unk> way to decide what we can have to <unk> this <unk> .
The <unk> has <unk> with the <unk> <unk> in the way to <unk> all the <unk> .
And when we put it in the cell was <unk> and <unk> our <unk> the new <unk> , <unk> , <unk> the new <unk> , <unk> <unk> in the cell .
And <unk> <unk> that we didn 't go beyond , but we tried to <unk> more in there .
This is one of the <unk> of evolution .
We found that <unk> species species have <unk> a second or a third <unk> from some <unk> , <unk> in a second thousands of new <unk> <unk> to that species .
So who think about evolution as a only <unk> at time you know , it 's not a lot of of the biology .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> the DNA .
The <unk> that was in the cell didn 't get one .
The <unk> <unk> that we <unk> .
It 's <unk> , and he 's <unk> the other <unk> like <unk> material , and it 's <unk> , and we <unk> with only the <unk> and the new <unk> .
has become blue because of the genes we 've <unk> .
And in a short <unk> of time , all the <unk> of a kind of a kind of <unk> , and it 's <unk> of the new <unk> , <unk> on the new software that we <unk> in the cell .
All the <unk> are <unk> , the <unk> are <unk> , and when you <unk> the code <unk> <unk> exactly exactly to what we 've <unk> .
Now , this may look at <unk> , but we <unk> the software can change things things in a <unk> .
Now , I 've already <unk> that there 's not about <unk> -- but to <unk> -- but to <unk> <unk> -- but of the evolution , and I 've already said that maybe we 're going to create a new version of the <unk> in which <unk> new <unk> .
Why do it ?
I think it 's enough to <unk> when we think about our <unk> .
We 're going to go from six billion and a half billion people in the next 40 years .
So , to give a example : I was born in <unk> .
Now there are three people on the planet to <unk> in <unk> ; in 40 years , there will be four .
We 're <unk> problems now to find food , water and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> for six billion and a half and a half of people .
We 're still more <unk> to do it for nine billion .
<unk> more than five billion billion <unk> , more than 30 billion <unk> billion <unk> .
That means percent million <unk> a <unk> day .
When we 're trying to find <unk> <unk> , or any kind of <unk> , it will be a huge challenge .
In the more we have to <unk> all the <unk> of CO2 from these materials that <unk> in the atmosphere .
The day of the <unk> <unk> in the <unk> in the <unk> around the world , we have a <unk> with about 20 million genes , and I like to think that the <unk> <unk> for the future .
The <unk> <unk> <unk> only a <unk> about <unk> , and think about how many different things are <unk> out .
Our <unk> are <unk> data from the reality , and <unk> from our imagination .
Now , we have <unk> , because of these <unk> <unk> <unk> , can make what we call <unk> <unk> <unk> .
We can make a big robot that can produce a big robot that can produce a million <unk> .
Think of <unk> these 20 million genes or <unk> <unk> <unk> , or try to <unk> the <unk> to produce <unk> or <unk> , new <unk> , we can change , for a little team , and create <unk> biology now that in the last 20 years of science .
And it 's just a <unk> <unk> .
We can <unk> to <unk> , <unk> or <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
This is a <unk> of some software software <unk> that we 're working for being able to <unk> and <unk> and <unk> species to the computer .
Well , we don 't know how to be .
We know exactly how their <unk> code .
Now , we 're <unk> on the <unk> generation .
You 've seen that <unk> <unk> from the <unk> was a <unk> experiment .
We <unk> <unk> , and third generation that <unk> enough enough to <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> of the <unk> or different kinds of <unk> .
But the only way that biology can have a big impact without <unk> <unk> the cost of food and <unk> the <unk> would be <unk> the CO2 in matter . And we 're working for <unk> cells that can get to <unk> cells that can get to be able to get the first <unk> of <unk> in the <unk> generation in the next generation .
The <unk> light <unk> with the CO2 is a <unk> , but in our <unk> in the world , we found different <unk> .
This is a <unk> that we 've <unk> in the <unk> .
<unk> in the ocean , about <unk> feet to the <unk> of water <unk> .
<unk> <unk> from the CO2 using <unk> <unk> as <unk> <unk> .
We 're trying to understand if we can <unk> the CO2 , that can <unk> it can be <unk> by <unk> , to <unk> this process .
So , so short , we think we can be able to <unk> what the question of the <unk> of " that 's life is , we <unk> the <unk> goal of <unk> the whole industry .
<unk> . If you can 't do it from TED , where ?
It 's a main source of energy .
And we 're working for the same <unk> to create <unk> <unk> .
You saw this year with the flu , we 're always back to a year and with a dollar in less when it 's <unk> <unk> .
I think what you can change building <unk> <unk> in <unk> .
So , that 's how to start <unk> , now , the tree , the evolution of evolution , <unk> , <unk> the evolution with bacteria , <unk> cells .
We are <unk> so from the <unk> people .
Our goal is to do in a way to live enough to try to try to try to try to <unk> . Thank you very much .
First of all , I 'll show you , the most <unk> , some <unk> , the new technology that we 've got to <unk> a year ago .
It 's a environment where you can <unk> is to local level that <unk> is <unk> with a huge amount of data .
Here we 're seeing <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> with a kind of <unk> <unk> and <unk> , for a <unk> <unk> , <unk> images , <unk> the images like .
And it 's not what big the amount of information that we see , how big are these big <unk> of data or the images .
Most of the <unk> are <unk> photographs , but this example is a <unk> <unk> from the <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> , and <unk> in the <unk> of <unk> .
It 's not a difference because the only thing that <unk> the <unk> of a system like this is the number of <unk> in your screen in any time . It 's a very <unk> architecture .
This is a book , example of data , for no data .
This is <unk> <unk> . Every <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
So , <unk> that 's just about the <unk> and not images , we can do something like this , to see a real <unk> of the <unk> , not a little bit of a picture .
It could be a little bit <unk> for read a <unk> book .
I don 't want to show it .
This is a <unk> example . It 's a <unk> number of <unk> .
Every big image is the beginning of a <unk> .
And it really gives you the <unk> and the beautiful experience of a <unk> version of a <unk> or a <unk> <unk> , which is for nature <unk> <unk> .
We also did something with the <unk> of this , in particular <unk> ,
We created a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a much more than that you use in a normal <unk> and we 've <unk> <unk> , and we <unk> <unk> <unk> .
If you want to see the <unk> of this <unk> , you can see here .
Or other models , or even <unk> <unk> .
And this really <unk> some of these ideas to <unk> the <unk> of space on the screen .
<unk> that <unk> to put up to <unk> and other <unk> , <unk> , not <unk> to be <unk> .
Of course , the <unk> is one of the most <unk> <unk> for this kind of technology .
And on this , I don 't want to <unk> time , if we don 't say that we have <unk> to have in this field .
These are all the streets in the United States <unk> <unk> <unk> .
So now , I 'm going to go to something else .
This is actually actually , in the <unk> , you can see it .
It 's a project called <unk> , which <unk> two different technologies .
One is <unk> and the other is a very interesting <unk> to a very interesting <unk> <unk> , a student of <unk> , with the <unk> of Washington , with the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And it 's from live on the Web , <unk> .
You can see when we do this kind of <unk> , where we can go from a image of <unk> to the other and have this kind of experience to <unk> <unk> .
But the <unk> <unk> of the images here has actually a meaning .
So , the <unk> of <unk> computers have <unk> these images , in the way that <unk> to the <unk> <unk> in which <unk> the <unk> <unk> on the <unk> <unk> on the <unk> <unk> on the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and that 's <unk> <unk> , and these things are all <unk> things are <unk> .
I don 't know if I have time to show you some other environment .
There are a much more <unk> .
I want to go to one of the <unk> of data , and this <unk> from a <unk> <unk> of <unk> that we 've done in the summer , for the first time to show you what it 's really the key <unk> to show you what the key <unk> is the key to show you that we 've got in the website .
We had to <unk> <unk> and <unk> and <unk> .
This is a <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> images of <unk> <unk> and <unk> images of these <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> .
So , I 'm all <unk> images , and you 're all <unk> to the <unk> level of this way .
And it 's possible to <unk> this way .
You know , I would never have thought about to work for <unk> .
It 's very <unk> <unk> this kind of <unk> here .
I think you know that 's a lot of different kinds of different kinds of <unk> : from the <unk> <unk> , a <unk> number , <unk> <unk> , a <unk> number , <unk> together together in this environment .
And if I can , I can try to look at the <unk> .
A lot of <unk> , and that 's <unk> .
And then , there 's a series of photographs -- <unk> .
This is a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
We can go from the <unk> to the <unk> physics of this environment .
The <unk> is that we can do about the social environment . This is now <unk> data from <unk> <unk> from the whole <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> of how to <unk> the <unk> , and <unk> all of the data .
All the <unk> picture , the most <unk> of the <unk> parts .
You have a model of the whole thing that <unk> .
Think about this as a <unk> of the work of <unk> <unk> on Earth .
It 's something that <unk> in the <unk> of the people , and the <unk> that <unk> the <unk> <unk> with the use .
They 're <unk> with <unk> <unk> from other people .
If somebody 's the idea of <unk> all these <unk> <unk> the name , my <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of all those data , and I can use how to <unk> to <unk> in the space , in that <unk> <unk> , using the picture of <unk> and <unk> and <unk> .
Of course , a <unk> of all the interesting <unk> of all interesting <unk> of the land , <unk> , <unk> not only from <unk> <unk> and <unk> and <unk> images .
You have to <unk> .
Chris Anderson : I realized it ? What is what your software software will be <unk> to do is that in a certain point , in the next years , all the <unk> <unk> <unk> from anybody in the world will be <unk> <unk> together ?
<unk> : Yeah . What 's doing it , it 's doing it .
It 's <unk> , if you want , you , between images .
And that 's doing it in the <unk> of the images .
The very interesting thing becomes very interesting if you think about the <unk> of information that many of these <unk> images .
As a <unk> of images on the Web , you <unk> a <unk> and the <unk> on the page , it 's the <unk> on the <unk> <unk> on the picture .
Now , what happens if that picture is going to <unk> all your picture ?
So the amount of <unk> <unk> and the amount of <unk> that 's really enormous . It 's a <unk> effect . It 's a <unk> effect of the network .
CA : <unk> , it 's really incredible <unk> .
<unk> : You 're going to be very much .
One of the main <unk> when you <unk> and one of the <unk> <unk> , is the <unk> that we can live in the <unk> <unk> , between the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> ,
<unk> think that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> still over the <unk> <unk> , or that the <unk> <unk> are still <unk> of <unk> , or that in <unk> , or that in <unk> , to <unk> the <unk> <unk> , to <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> , and that the idea that the world we have no <unk> in which the world we have a sense that the world that the <unk> <unk> , but it 's <unk> <unk> .
And the <unk> of a particular <unk> of choices that our <unk> <unk> has done , or good , many <unk> ago .
And of course , all the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Everybody <unk> . Everybody <unk> .
We 're <unk> to <unk> .
We need to <unk> the <unk> of death , so we don 't get if you <unk> and <unk> --
We all have a art .
What <unk> is the <unk> particular of the song , the <unk> of the <unk> of every culture .
It 's not that the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> , or the <unk> of <unk> , or the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , or a <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk> .
He was my <unk> of <unk> in the <unk> a month ago , or a <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of <unk> , on the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> ,
All these <unk> <unk> us that are other ways of other ways of other ways of <unk> , other ways to move in the world .
And if you <unk> a moment , it 's a concept that can give you hope .
<unk> , the <unk> of the world <unk> are a <unk> of life and <unk> that <unk> the planet and <unk> is important for the <unk> of the planet as the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And you can think about this <unk> <unk> as a <unk> and you can <unk> the <unk> of all the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> ideas , <unk> , <unk> ideas , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> in the imagination of the human <unk> .
The <unk> is the great <unk> of humanity .
It 's the <unk> of what we are and what we can be in how to <unk> .
And <unk> the <unk> was <unk> <unk> <unk> was happened to <unk> and <unk> much more <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , for example , <unk> that 50 percent of all the species was or is about <unk> <unk> , or it 's <unk> , or -- in the <unk> <unk> , or -- and you can 't even <unk> to <unk> -- and you don 't even even even <unk> to <unk> -- that 's <unk> in the <unk> <unk> -- and you can see the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> of all that is , of course , the <unk> <unk> .
When you 're <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> on this planet .
A <unk> language is not just a <unk> or a <unk> <unk> or a series of rules of rules .
One language is the human spirit .
It 's the middle with the <unk> of every culture comes in the world .
Every language is a forest of the mind , a <unk> , a <unk> thinking , a <unk> of <unk> .
And of those <unk> <unk> , as we 're here in <unk> , at least half the <unk> of the children is not <unk> in the <unk> of the children .
They 're not going to be <unk> to children , which means , less than it , which is <unk> .
What 's more <unk> of being <unk> by the <unk> , of being <unk> , the last to talk about a language , of the <unk> of <unk> or <unk> <unk> the <unk> of <unk> or <unk> the <unk> of <unk> ?
This <unk> <unk> was the <unk> was a few few weeks of every two weeks : every two weeks , every two weeks , <unk> <unk> and <unk> with it in the <unk> <unk> of a <unk> language .
And I know that somebody of you <unk> " . " It 's not better ?
The world would not be a better place if you <unk> all the same language ? " <unk> , so we 're all <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> a <unk> thing , it means not to <unk> their language .
I 'd like to do you to do a journey through the <unk> --
a little <unk> journey in the <unk> for you a <unk> of what we 're <unk> .
Many of us <unk> that when I say , " I 'm going to <unk> , " I really think different ways of <unk> .
<unk> for example this <unk> <unk> , in <unk> <unk> , the <unk> of <unk> , which <unk> to <unk> <unk> from the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
It 's a <unk> that 's not able to <unk> the blue color of the green because the <unk> is <unk> in the time , the <unk> <unk> , which <unk> <unk> .
They have a <unk> language and a <unk> rule , " <unk> " : " <unk> " : you have to <unk> a different person that 's language .
All that 's <unk> in the past <unk> , but the <unk> is that in these families <unk> <unk> , where they 're talking to six or seven <unk> to <unk> <unk> .
It <unk> to hear and then <unk> to talk .
<unk> one of the most interesting <unk> with the <unk> of the most interesting <unk> , a <unk> <unk> , a incredible <unk> that had the first <unk> in the <unk> .
In <unk> five <unk> , they <unk> a <unk> <unk> .
They 've done <unk> from the <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> that <unk> <unk> , which this <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> had never seen anything .
They <unk> the <unk> picture of the Earth , they <unk> to research a form or a <unk> , and they 're not going to <unk> , they <unk> <unk> <unk> , and they <unk> the five <unk> with the <unk> .
But the <unk> doesn 't just <unk> <unk> .
They <unk> <unk> between them .
The <unk> percent of <unk> was <unk> by them .
We 've been <unk> for eight <unk> and we found two <unk> of death and when we 've got to know , they <unk> that one of them was so <unk> <unk> , and then they <unk> it . And then they <unk> it . And then they <unk> it .
The <unk> were able to recognize the <unk> animal from 40 <unk> and <unk> the species .
<unk> years , I was <unk> a very interesting job when my <unk> <unk> , I was a very interesting job when my <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> of <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
So , I should have to <unk> , I would have to understand the <unk> culture , and that the <unk> is not <unk> <unk> .
It 's pretty a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of the world .
<unk> interesting .
If you <unk> the big <unk> <unk> of the world , what would you <unk> ?
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , etc . .
A continent is always <unk> out , thinking that Africa doesn 't have <unk> <unk> . And instead of it 's not the other that the <unk> of these <unk> <unk> <unk> .
What makes the <unk> is the <unk> of the <unk> between life and death .
So the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> can be <unk> by the <unk> <unk> , <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> and <unk> to the <unk> of the live in the <unk> .
So , the <unk> <unk> saying , " <unk> <unk> <unk> , " <unk> <unk> .
We <unk> in the <unk> and <unk> God . "
And from the moment that you 're <unk> , is the spirit that you can <unk> it ?
So , you know , incredible <unk> : <unk> <unk> in <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a pretty much of the power of the mind of the body when it 's <unk> in a state of <unk> .
We all the <unk> with the <unk> that I 've been the most <unk> are the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , in the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> on the <unk> <unk> .
In a <unk> continent , this <unk> never been <unk> by <unk> .
And I 'm <unk> today are <unk> by a <unk> , but they 're <unk> .
The young <unk> are <unk> on the families , and they live in a <unk> world , and live in a world <unk> and <unk> in <unk> <unk> for 18 years .
Two years of nine years <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , now are <unk> in the <unk> of the mother , now are <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk> .
So , this time , they 're <unk> to values , values that they <unk> and only their <unk> and only their <unk> <unk> <unk> -- or to say the <unk> <unk> <unk> -- or to say the <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> of this incredible <unk> , are <unk> <unk> out and for the first time in life , at the age of 18 years , see a <unk> . And in that , I 'm going to <unk> , when the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and when the <unk> <unk> <unk> , what they 're going to have to <unk> <unk> .
" <unk> ? <unk> <unk> like I said .
It 's <unk> . Now it 's <unk> . "
They call <unk> <unk> and say that we , <unk> <unk> , we are the <unk> of the <unk> of the world .
This level of <unk> is extremely important .
When we think about <unk> and <unk> environment <unk> and the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , which is a <unk> <unk> in its <unk> or maybe <unk> <unk> and say that these <unk> are more <unk> to the Earth .
The <unk> <unk> are not <unk> or <unk> or <unk> from the <unk> .
There 's no space for these things in the <unk> of <unk> or in the <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> , but for time and <unk> , they created a <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> , but on a <unk> <unk> <unk> , but on a <unk> <unk> , but on a <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> that the <unk> is that the human <unk> .
What does it mean ?
<unk> , which is a <unk> of the <unk> that the mountain is a <unk> <unk> that <unk> the mountain is a different human being <unk> and <unk> has a different <unk> and <unk> a different <unk> of the mountain or that place in a <unk> of <unk> that <unk> <unk> that <unk> is a mountain that <unk> <unk> that <unk> is a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
That 's the <unk> of a spirit or a <unk> <unk> is <unk> .
What 's interesting is the <unk> that <unk> the <unk> between the <unk> and the natural world .
I grew up in the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> to be <unk> .
And that has <unk> me a different human <unk> from my <unk> that they believe that the <unk> are the <unk> of <unk> and the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that live in the <unk> <unk> , <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
If you <unk> to <unk> that these <unk> can create a different <unk> , to start to understand some of them <unk> <unk> .
I have <unk> this picture in <unk> in the <unk> <unk> .
Maybe some of you have heard about the <unk> , the most powerful <unk> <unk> <unk> .
What makes the <unk> is not the potential <unk> of the <unk> , but he 's <unk> by two <unk> .
<unk> , this <unk> <unk> that has a series of <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , <unk> .
<unk> the only <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
This <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , very similar to <unk> , <unk> .
If you 'll ever see the <unk> <unk> on the <unk> that they do from a different <unk> of species , <unk> <unk> .
<unk> that <unk> on the <unk> is a little bit like to be <unk> by a <unk> <unk> of <unk> and <unk> on a <unk> of <unk> .
<unk> often with my <unk> , Richard <unk> <unk> , the man who <unk> the man who <unk> was <unk> , with his discovery of <unk> <unk> in the years in <unk> .
My <unk> can 't be <unk> these <unk> as <unk> because if you 're going to do it , you can 't tell about it .
It 's possible <unk> <unk> only if you can <unk> with other <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> .
Now , the beautiful : the <unk> that are in this <unk> are <unk> of the <unk> , of the same kind of <unk> <unk> . The question <unk> <unk> : in a <unk> of <unk> species , how do these <unk> <unk> .
We use the big <unk> of the <unk> and the <unk> , that can <unk> <unk> .
But if you <unk> , we <unk> " <unk> " <unk> plants us . "
What does it mean ?
This <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , which <unk> <unk> in the forest , and that we <unk> <unk> in the forest , and that our eyes <unk> <unk> in the same species .
If the <unk> like <unk> their <unk> , " <unk> <unk> , " <unk> <unk> , " <unk> <unk> <unk> , " No , " I said , " No . "
The solution is : you take the <unk> <unk> in a night of <unk> and <unk> with a different <unk> .
With this , you don 't <unk> to <unk> , but it 's much more interesting that <unk> the <unk> .
Now , <unk> the problem is that also the ones that are <unk> to the heart <unk> <unk> <unk> them , but in some way to <unk> the story of the story of the story of the real story of our world , and <unk> .
In fact , the <unk> century , in 300 years , not <unk> to <unk> or its <unk> <unk> , but rather like , rather like , it was where we <unk> and <unk> or <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> <unk> , or <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> the planet . Now , it 's not the change .
All the <unk> through the <unk> <unk> have been <unk> in a new <unk> for new <unk> .
And the problem is not the technology .
The <unk> <unk> didn 't have <unk> to be <unk> when they put <unk> and <unk> so as the <unk> have <unk> and <unk> as the <unk> <unk> .
It 's not the change or technology that <unk> the <unk> of <unk> . It 's power .
The <unk> <unk> of the <unk> .
And if you look at a look at the world , <unk> that these are not <unk> <unk> to <unk> .
They 're <unk> creatures and <unk> <unk> out of the <unk> forces that are <unk> in their <unk> of <unk> .
<unk> that <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of <unk> --
a <unk> <unk> <unk> , in the <unk> <unk> , a <unk> that has been in the forest to a generation , and now <unk> to the <unk> and <unk> on the <unk> <unk> , where you can see the <unk> <unk> <unk> , where you can see the <unk> <unk> <unk> , where the <unk> <unk> <unk> , where the <unk> <unk> <unk> , where the <unk> <unk> , where the <unk> <unk> <unk> , where the <unk> <unk> <unk> , where the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> ,
We <unk> to <unk> the <unk> with the <unk> <unk> to the forest .
Or , in the case of the <unk> , are the <unk> of <unk> .
If you <unk> on the <unk> of the <unk> , where I 'm doing the <unk> <unk> of politics .
As <unk> the <unk> , the <unk> physics of a <unk> , is <unk> at the <unk> of <unk> , but the <unk> of <unk> <unk> of life , not only it 's <unk> , but <unk> <unk> in some <unk> , because it 's <unk> in some <unk> , because it 's a <unk> <unk> in <unk> .
And you can 't understand the <unk> of the <unk> until the beginning .
I have the <unk> miles from <unk> in the <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> to <unk> with a young <unk> , but only <unk> <unk> <unk> , but only <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> million people from the <unk> <unk> during the <unk> <unk> .
The father of this guy was <unk> to <unk> <unk> .
The which means that it was <unk> to the <unk> time of <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> is <unk> with <unk> <unk> in <unk> , which <unk> <unk> in <unk> .
My mother was <unk> and his <unk> was <unk> .
It was <unk> of <unk> in <unk> at the age of two years <unk> , <unk> , because it would have no <unk> .
The <unk> , who did the same , was <unk> in <unk> <unk> .
A day has <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> and , for this <unk> , and it was <unk> to <unk> to <unk> seven years .
The <unk> of the <unk> can be <unk> , but the <unk> of the <unk> is from <unk> .
And then , it 's all <unk> to a choice .
Do you have to live in the <unk> world or we want to <unk> the world of diversity ?
The big <unk> <unk> <unk> , before they were going to die that his most great <unk> was that his most great <unk> was that , in our <unk> <unk> <unk> of the human imagination of imagination to a <unk> <unk> of human imagination to <unk> to <unk> <unk> of thinking , but a day , and a day , and a day , there was <unk> <unk> that were other <unk> .
And it 's <unk> to remember that our species is <unk> for <unk> years .
The <unk> <unk> , that has given us to agriculture , which has <unk> to <unk> <unk> , <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> , and we talk about <unk> years ago .
The <unk> world <unk> <unk> <unk> .
That <unk> story , I didn 't <unk> that we have the answers to <unk> in <unk> .
When we <unk> <unk> of the <unk> of the world is to say , <unk> with <unk> different <unk> .
And it 's in these answers that we all <unk> the <unk> of being what we are : a kind of <unk> , that it has to make it to be a way that all the <unk> and all the <unk> can <unk> .
I <unk> this picture on the <unk> <unk> of <unk> , when I went to <unk> <unk> with <unk> , and this man , <unk> me , and this man , <unk> me a <unk> story of his <unk> .
The government <unk> was not always <unk> with the <unk> <unk> and in the ' <unk> and in the ' <unk> , we <unk> them in <unk> .
The <unk> of this man <unk> <unk> .
The family , <unk> for his life , <unk> and <unk> all the <unk> , and all of his <unk> .
You know that the <unk> doesn 't <unk> the cold , it 's <unk> .
The <unk> of the <unk> were <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> of this man didn 't <unk> from night or <unk> <unk> that <unk> .
It 's <unk> on , it 's <unk> <unk> in the skin of <unk> and <unk> in your hand . When I did the <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
It <unk> <unk> on the <unk> of this <unk> <unk> and when <unk> <unk> , <unk> a dog .
He <unk> the dog and created a <unk> , with the <unk> <unk> <unk> has created a <unk> , and it 's <unk> on the <unk> , <unk> <unk> in <unk> .
<unk> to talk about <unk> with nothing ? [ <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> the government <unk> <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> of a <unk> area of <unk> , the big <unk> of California and <unk> <unk> together .
It 's their new <unk> . It 's called <unk> .
It 's a <unk> <unk> . <unk> all the <unk> resources .
One example of how a <unk> can <unk> with his <unk> .
And , to end , I think it 's pretty <unk> at least at least who 's been in these <unk> <unk> of the planet , <unk> that they 're not going to be <unk> at all .
For somebody is home .
<unk> <unk> of human imagination that <unk> to <unk> of the human imagination . And for us all , the dreams of these children , as the <unk> of our children , become part of the hope .
So , we 're <unk> <unk> <unk> , we <unk> <unk> that the <unk> never <unk> .
<unk> that <unk> --
<unk> <unk> , they 're not <unk> , but we believe that stories can change the world , and maybe maybe we are the best <unk> for stories of the world . Every month our <unk> <unk> million <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> our <unk> .
Our <unk> are <unk> by millions of people .
Our work is <unk> in the <unk> for our audience in <unk> places that <unk> <unk> from which <unk> <unk> from which <unk> <unk> and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> , <unk> for the <unk> of <unk> : the <unk> world 's <unk> in <unk> , and we have to find a world .
where the <unk> of all the <unk> can <unk> to our <unk> <unk> .
Thank you .
I 'm going to talk about some of some things that I 've been <unk> , and I hope you 've already heard and <unk> to <unk> some <unk> , in the case , you don 't <unk> them .
I 'm going to start with what I call " the <unk> <unk> . "
The <unk> <unk> of what ?
The <unk> <unk> of all the society <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> : " If we want to <unk> the <unk> of our citizens " <unk> <unk> . "
The reason is , from a side , in fact that the freedom is in itself a value , is <unk> , <unk> , <unk> for human beings .
<unk> another is in fact that if we 're <unk> , each of us can do everything that we 're going to do everything that we <unk> our <unk> <unk> , no one that <unk> our <unk> .
The way to <unk> the <unk> is <unk> .
<unk> the most choices , the more <unk> , and more , and the most is their <unk> , and the most of them are their <unk> .
This , <unk> , it 's so <unk> <unk> in society that no one <unk> of <unk> in <unk> .
And it 's also <unk> <unk> in our lives .
I 'll show you some examples of what the progress has possible .
This is my <unk> . It 's not particularly big .
I <unk> a simple <unk> on the <unk> for <unk> .
In my <unk> , there are <unk> <unk> , without <unk> the <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> and 12 <unk> <unk> <unk> that you can buy for a huge number of <unk> in the <unk> <unk> that nobody of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that nobody of the <unk> <unk> is <unk> .
So , what 's the <unk> .
And then you go to the <unk> <unk> for <unk> : <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
And in this single <unk> <unk> , there 's a big number of <unk> <unk> .
We can do it to the <unk> million <unk> using the <unk> that there are in a only <unk> .
<unk> <unk> that there is <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> : the world 's <unk> .
<unk> , when I was a child , you could get all the <unk> services , <unk> that they were <unk> by <unk> <unk> .
It <unk> the phone , you don 't <unk> it .
A <unk> of this , in the other , was that the phone never <unk> .
These time are gone .
Now , we have a <unk> almost <unk> , especially between the <unk> .
Here 's the <unk> of the future .
My <unk> is that in the middle , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> for the <unk> <unk> .
If you don 't have the <unk> <unk> , you 're not <unk> in the <unk> , you 're going to be <unk> .
And what 's going to happen is that people <unk> in the <unk> and does this question . And you know , it 's the answer is , " No . "
It 's not possible to buy a phone that doesn 't <unk> .
So , in other <unk> of life that are much more important than the <unk> , the same <unk> of choices .
<unk> <unk> : <unk> , it 's not going to be <unk> , and the <unk> you will <unk> what you have to do .
Instead , <unk> from the <unk> , and the <unk> says , " OK , " or <unk> , " or <unk> " <unk> " <unk> " <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . " <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . What do you want to do ? "
You know , " <unk> , what do you <unk> ? "
And the <unk> says , " <unk> , " <unk> , and <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> these <unk> and these <unk> . "
" What do you want to do ? "
And you <unk> , " <unk> if she was me , what would you <unk> ? "
And the <unk> , " But I 'm not not she 's she 's not she . "
The result of the <unk> of the <unk> " , " <unk> that 's <unk> it looks like a beautiful thing .
But actually , it 's not a <unk> <unk> the <unk> and responsibility to make decisions from somebody who knows something , <unk> the <unk> , to <unk> , to <unk> the <unk> , to <unk> , and so it 's not <unk> -- and so in <unk> for it .
There 's a huge <unk> of <unk> <unk> , <unk> to people like me and you , that if you think it doesn 't have any sense , because it doesn 't <unk> .
But if we can 't <unk> , why ?
The answer is that they want to <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> that fundamental as a <unk> of the <unk> is a question of choice , as you see in this <unk> , " We want to <unk> children . " We want to <unk> . " We need to <unk> . " We need to <unk> . We have to <unk> .
And we can <unk> how many times we <unk> .
The one is that every <unk> , to <unk> , you have to decide that kind of person you want to be .
<unk> to the family and <unk> , a time the common perspective , <unk> almost for anybody , it was that <unk> the <unk> <unk> .
The only one is to the one to the people , and even what to do after .
<unk> , all , it 's really <unk> .
They were going to go to very smart , and they <unk> them , less than a time .
And it 's not because they 're not <unk> , because they 're not <unk> .
But why are <unk> , I 'm <unk> , " <unk> or not ?
" <unk> <unk> <unk> later ? I have to think before or to the career ? "
They 're <unk> <unk> .
And they try to answer these questions , even if this <unk> doesn 't <unk> the <unk> that <unk> and not get a big <unk> to my <unk> .
And they have to do it . They 're important questions .
Now , the work : we 're <unk> , like <unk> <unk> , because the technology is a lot of work , every day , from every day , from every day , <unk> that <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , there 's a <unk> , and I don 't say , what the <unk> works .
I 'm not going to tell you , because I want to use it .
What does , this incredible <unk> of choice we have about work ? It 's that we have to <unk> , <unk> , <unk> every moment , if we have to work or no .
We can go to see our son , with the phone in a <unk> , the <unk> in the other , and the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> on the <unk> .
And if I 'm all <unk> , every minute that we see our son , we 're also <unk> , " I have to answer this ? "
" I have to answer this <unk> ? I have to <unk> this ? "
And also when the answer is , " it makes the experience of the <unk> experience of your <unk> , very different <unk> from what was in other conditions .
So , from any part , look at all , and big objects , and <unk> , and <unk> of life , life is a question of choices .
Once the world was this : <unk> , there were some <unk> , but it was not a question of choice .
The world of today is <unk> , <unk> is , " It 's a <unk> thing , or <unk> ? "
The answer is <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> <unk> them , so I 'm going to talk about the <unk> .
<unk> this choice <unk> two actually actually <unk> on people .
The first <unk> , <unk> , is that <unk> <unk> .
With a lot of <unk> in which is very difficult to do it .
I 'll give you a <unk> example : a study of <unk> <unk> <unk> .
A <unk> <unk> has been access to the data , the <unk> society of <unk> , with about a million <unk> in <unk> <unk> .
What she found it out of every 10 solutions that are <unk> in the most , the <unk> of <unk> <unk> of two percent .
With 50 <unk> <unk> , there 's 10 percent in less than <unk> than when they 're available . Why are they available . Why ?
Because with 50 <unk> in which is <unk> to decide , and the choice is <unk> to <unk> .
And in <unk> , and still <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and of course , <unk> , and of course , <unk> <unk> , and of course , <unk> <unk> , and of course , <unk> , <unk> , and of course , <unk> , and of course , <unk> , and of course , <unk> , and of course , and of course , and of course , and of course , of course , and of course , and of course , <unk> <unk> , and of course , and of course
<unk> that doesn 't mean that this is not just that these <unk> <unk> food for <unk> , it 's the decision is so <unk> that the decision is so <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of work .
They 're not going to go to five <unk> <unk> <unk> for a year from <unk> , which would be <unk> to <unk> .
So the <unk> is a <unk> of <unk> choices .
And I think I think the world .
" And to end , to <unk> : <unk> or <unk> ? "
You know , it 's going to take the right decision , right ?
You don 't want to <unk> the <unk> wrong , and <unk> the <unk> <unk> .
So this is the first effect . The second is that 's the second . It 's that if we can <unk> <unk> and make a choice , at the end , we 're less <unk> by the <unk> of how to <unk> with the <unk> .
And this for different reasons .
One of these is that with many <unk> between which is that you can have a lot of <unk> , is not perfect , it 's easy to make a different choice that would be better . And that 's what 's the <unk> <unk> <unk> to <unk> us to <unk> to <unk> , and the <unk> of <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> of the <unk> ,
And so when it was a <unk> decision .
<unk> <unk> , there are , more <unk> than it is <unk> <unk> of any <unk> .
<unk> , there is what the <unk> called <unk> .
A <unk> <unk> has <unk> very good as the value that we <unk> things that we <unk> .
<unk> , when there are many <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> that 's choice .
Here 's a example . I 'm going to <unk> with all the New York .
But that 's what you probably <unk> .
There 's this <unk> to <unk> .
A <unk> place .
<unk> <unk> . <unk> day . It 's all for them .
It 's not <unk> . But what he 's said , " Well , <unk> , it 's <unk> . "
" All my <unk> to <unk> are on . "
" <unk> <unk> <unk> right to home . "
And it 's two weeks from the idea that 's <unk> -- every day -- the <unk> of <unk> where it wants .
The <unk> <unk> <unk> for that we have , even when the choice was <unk> .
And the most <unk> we have from <unk> , the most <unk> <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Here 's another example .
This <unk> <unk> says us a lot of things .
We 're going to be a moment , and maybe in the <unk> .
But the most important point is that any <unk> you , you 're not going to do the other other .
The things that we don 't have a lot of <unk> that can make it less <unk> what we do .
<unk> <unk> : <unk> <unk> .
I tried to <unk> on my skin <unk> a new couple of <unk> .
It 's almost always <unk> .
<unk> were <unk> , they were just a kind of them , and <unk> by <unk> , they were <unk> , just after <unk> a lot of <unk> , and <unk> a lot of times , <unk> to go .
So , I <unk> to <unk> a couple of when the <unk> were <unk> , and I said , " I need a couple of <unk> , this is my <unk> . "
The <unk> <unk> said , " <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> ? "
You want to <unk> or <unk> ? "
" <unk> <unk> ? "
" <unk> them want to <unk> or <unk> ? <unk> <unk> <unk> .
I was <unk> , and after a little bit of I had to say , " I want the one , " I want the only kind of <unk> me , so it 's the <unk> <unk> . And then I 'm <unk> all <unk> <unk> , and then <unk> <unk> .
It was the <unk> . With all that choice I had <unk> the best .
But I 'm going to <unk> me .
Why ? I wrote a whole book for <unk> .
The reason I was worse is that with all of the choice , my <unk> were <unk> , the <unk> <unk> to be <unk> .
And I had <unk> <unk> . I didn 't <unk> anything when I was just a kind of <unk> , but when they <unk> them , at least a kind of being perfect .
What I had <unk> was good , but not perfect .
After <unk> what I was <unk> to what I was <unk> in <unk> to <unk> .
The <unk> of <unk> in life , not that <unk> the <unk> that these are <unk> that are <unk> that they have <unk> <unk> of the same .
And this <unk> less <unk> , even when the results are good .
<unk> in the world of the <unk> world .
Because if you <unk> , I 'm not going to <unk> , I 'm talking about it .
The truth is the most <unk> .
" It was better when it was worse , " why it was better when it was better when it was worse , it was <unk> as it was <unk> as as it was <unk> .
<unk> , in the world we live in -- <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> that we can <unk> is the things are the <unk> of the <unk> .
You never <unk> because your <unk> , my <unk> , you 're <unk> .
The <unk> of happiness -- that 's what you are here -- is , " <unk> " Yes , " Yeah , " Yeah , " Yeah , you want . "
I mean , little moment , I 'm really <unk> and my wife is really <unk> .
I couldn 't have it better , I didn 't have <unk> .
But <unk> , it 's not a <unk> thing .
<unk> , a <unk> of <unk> <unk> when there 's only that kind of <unk> is that kind of <unk> is when you 're not <unk> , and you <unk> , " Why ? "
" Who is <unk> ? "
The world is the <unk> . What can you do it ?
When there are hundreds of kinds of <unk> , and you <unk> a <unk> , and you 'll 'll tell you who 's the <unk> , it 's <unk> that the <unk> you are .
They could have it better .
With hundreds of <unk> available , there are not <unk> for the <unk> .
So when people make decisions , even if the result is <unk> , you <unk> and <unk> and <unk> to them to them them same .
In the last years , the <unk> <unk> in the <unk> world .
I think a <unk> <unk> -- not the only , but important -- that 's really important , but -- that people have been <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , because the <unk> are too <unk> .
And when they have to <unk> this situation , they 're going to be them .
So the final result is that in general , we 're better , but we <unk> it .
I 'll be going to <unk> you .
This is the <unk> <unk> , what we all take for good and it 's completely <unk> . It 's not true .
There 's no <unk> that a little bit of choice is better than it 's not <unk> . But from this is not <unk> a lot of choice .
There 's a <unk> , <unk> . I don 't know what it 's .
But I 'm sure we have <unk> from a piece of the level where the choices <unk> our life .
Now , from the <unk> <unk> -- I 've been <unk> -- from the point of view , the <unk> is the <unk> .
What allows you to all this choice in the <unk> society is <unk> material .
There are many places in the world , and you 're <unk> <unk> , where the problem is not that they have <unk> choice .
The problem is that they have too <unk> .
So the <unk> I 'm talking about is a <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> society .
And what <unk> <unk> and <unk> is this : <unk> <unk> you 've talked about that that <unk> and <unk> <unk> for <unk> are <unk> .
I mean that these choices , <unk> and <unk> , it 's not that they are <unk> .
They 're <unk> <unk> .
They do better .
If a little bit about what in our society is <unk> to <unk> , where people have too a few , and it would have too a few , it would not just be their life , but also our own own life .
This is what the <unk> called a <unk> <unk> .
A <unk> of the income income is good to all -- not only to the poor -- because of this choice in <unk> that <unk> us .
So , to <unk> , " <unk> , you can become all you want to --
<unk> , people , <unk> , <unk> , " But what would you <unk> that fish ? "
" It 's <unk> that you can 't make anything in a <unk> of glass . "
" A <unk> <unk> , a <unk> <unk> , a <unk> <unk> vision of the world -- "
and I <unk> the <unk> , so I <unk> it , at the beginning .
But then , <unk> , instead , I realized that fish knows that fish knows what the long is .
Because the reality of the fact that if you <unk> the <unk> , in the way that 's possible possible possible . " It 's not <unk> . " It 's not <unk> the <unk> .
If you <unk> the <unk> in the way that all <unk> possible possible <unk> .
<unk> the <unk> , and <unk> the <unk> .
Everybody need a <unk> .
This is almost almost of course too <unk> , maybe for the fish , and it 's <unk> for us .
But the <unk> of some <unk> <unk> is a <unk> for the <unk> and , for the <unk> .
Thank you .
