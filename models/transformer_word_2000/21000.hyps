<unk> year I showed these <unk> for <unk> that the <unk> <unk> <unk> , which for almost three million years has had the size of the United States <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
So , we <unk> this <unk> the <unk> of the problem because it 's not <unk> the <unk> of the ice .
<unk> <unk> <unk> is , in a way , the heart of the global warming .
They <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
The next <unk> will be a <unk> <unk> <unk> on the last 25 years .
<unk> <unk> are <unk> in red .
As you see , it <unk> up to the blue <unk> .
That 's the ice in <unk> , which <unk> in the summer .
You can see that the <unk> ice <unk> , five years or more , is like your blood , which here <unk> from the body .
In 25 years , it 's been <unk> like this .
This is a problem because the <unk> <unk> <unk> around the ocean <unk> where there are huge <unk> of <unk> that , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> in <unk> .
<unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , the amount of <unk> could <unk> , and this <unk> point .
In some <unk> <unk> <unk> , the <unk> is already <unk> by the water .
The <unk> <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> ! <unk> : She 's good . <unk> : She 's good .
A reason is that this <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> from the <unk> .
This is a <unk> river <unk> .
<unk> had never <unk> levels .
This is the <unk> river , in the <unk> of the <unk> .
If you want to know how the <unk> <unk> <unk> to the sea level to <unk> , here is where the sea is where the sea .
These <unk> are <unk> <unk> .
On the other part of the planet : <unk> , the largest <unk> of the ice on the planet .
The last month , the scientists have <unk> that the <unk> of the ice is in <unk> , and that <unk> <unk> on some <unk> <unk> , is particularly <unk> in <unk> .
<unk> at <unk> <unk> , like <unk> <unk> , like <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> of ice , you see new <unk> , which a few years ago were <unk> .
<unk> percent of the world population <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> : this <unk> is the source of the water <unk> of this city .
<unk> is <unk> .
But when you <unk> , the same happens to the <unk> water .
In California , <unk> <unk> <unk> is 40 percent .
<unk> <unk> are in the crisis .
<unk> , as you read , they 're <unk> .
<unk> <unk> in the world <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> are <unk> to a normal and without <unk> .
<unk> times more <unk> in the last 30 years than the <unk> <unk> .
This is a <unk> of the <unk> .
If you look at it in the context is <unk> if you can see the <unk> .
In the last five years we have <unk> 70 million <unk> of CO2 every day .
Look at <unk> the area of the <unk> <unk> , <unk> , and on both parts of the <unk> <unk> <unk> , where there 's a <unk> <unk> of oxygen in the ocean .
The <unk> cause of global warming , <unk> , <unk> , which is 20 percent , is the use of <unk> <unk> .
<unk> is a problem , and <unk> is even worse .
The United States is one of the two countries with <unk> emissions , together .
And it 's <unk> to build a lot of other <unk> .
But we 're <unk> to a <unk> of the direction .
These are the <unk> projects over the last years and some <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
<unk> , there is a <unk> policy in our country .
The <unk> of <unk> and oil <unk> have <unk> <unk> million dollars in the last year to <unk> <unk> <unk> , which is a <unk> .
I 'm going to <unk> something --
<unk> <unk> , in <unk> , where I live , there was a <unk> of <unk> billion <unk> .
You may have seen it on <unk> .
This is the largest flow of <unk> in America .
It 's happened around <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> was this .
<unk> : <unk> ♫ ♫ <unk> the <unk> is a <unk> and happy .
It 's <unk> here in America , and it <unk> our economy .
<unk> the <unk> is <unk> <unk> .
It 's <unk> , <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The largest society <unk> on the <unk> is <unk> . This is its <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> : <unk> <unk> -- Al <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> -- they don 't know what they 're talking about .
<unk> : So the <unk> for the <unk> <unk> has <unk> two <unk> .
This is one of them , one of them .
<unk> : <unk> : <unk> <unk> we see <unk> changes like a <unk> <unk> <unk> to our business .
So , our <unk> is <unk> a large amount of money in a <unk> <unk> to <unk> and <unk> the truth of <unk> .
In fact , <unk> is not <unk> .
We think it 's <unk> -- it 's also good <unk> .
So we don 't <unk> about climate change .
We want to do .
<unk> : <unk> : <unk> <unk> -- you 've heard about it very much .
So we <unk> a turn into a <unk> <unk> for how much <unk> is about <unk> .
<unk> ! <unk> cars are a little <unk> , but this is the sound of the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> is between the main <unk> of global warming , but the <unk> technology that you see changes all .
Let 's look : this is the <unk> <unk> technology .
<unk> : <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to the national security .
<unk> : <unk> : America is in the crisis ; the national security , the crisis .
The <unk> that <unk> all : our <unk> from the <unk> <unk> , like <unk> and oil <unk> .
Now , there 's a new , <unk> solution to <unk> .
<unk> America : 100 percent of <unk> energy , in 10 years .
A plan to <unk> America at work , <unk> , and more <unk> , and help <unk> global warming .
<unk> , a solution that we 're going to solve our problems .
<unk> America . We 're going to talk more .
<unk> : This is the last .
<unk> : It 's about <unk> energy to America .
One of the most <unk> ways to <unk> <unk> to the end of the <unk> that we <unk> our planet .
<unk> : The future is here . <unk> , <unk> , a new network <unk> .
<unk> <unk> 2 : <unk> <unk> <unk> for <unk> jobs .
<unk> : <unk> America . It 's time to be <unk> .
<unk> : A old <unk> <unk> says , " If you want to go , you go alone .
If you want to go far , go together . "
We have to go far , quickly .
Thank you very much .
<unk> year at TED , I did a <unk> on <unk> .
And I decided to <unk> <unk> on how the machine works .
So , here we go . And for those that the other time there were no , the largest scientific experiment ever <unk> -- <unk> miles of <unk> .
His task is to <unk> the conditions that were in the less than a <unk> <unk> from the beginning of the universe -- until <unk> million times a second .
All of that is just <unk> .
This is the car under <unk> .
We <unk> these <unk> <unk> in the <unk> .
This is what I work . It 's called <unk> -- it 's <unk> meters and has a <unk> <unk> .
This is a <unk> image of <unk> <unk> in <unk> so you can see the <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> last year we <unk> the machine for the first time .
And this picture was <unk> by <unk> .
It was <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> .
It 's a picture of the first <unk> of particles that had done all the <unk> , <unk> in <unk> , <unk> , with a part of the <unk> , and we <unk> particles in the <unk> .
In other words , when you <unk> the image , you <unk> , you know that the car <unk> , which is a great <unk> .
I don 't know if it was this to <unk> us more or this , when somebody <unk> on Google and I would say that the <unk> was this .
And that means that we had a <unk> impact <unk> .
<unk> a week later , there was a problem with the machine , <unk> , and these <unk> <unk> .
These <unk> <unk> <unk> when the car works at the <unk> <unk> .
Now , the <unk> between you <unk> <unk> and <unk> , " It 's not true . They 're too <unk> . "
And instead they can do it because when they 're very <unk> <unk> <unk> .
So , <unk> degrees <unk> degrees , at <unk> <unk> at the <unk> of the space between stars , these <unk> can bring that <unk> .
In one of the <unk> <unk> <unk> , there was a <unk> <unk> .
So the <unk> <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a electric <unk> .
This was the result .
Now , this is even <unk> if you think that these <unk> <unk> <unk> more than 20 <unk> , and that 's <unk> <unk> of about 30 <unk> .
They <unk> about 50 <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , what we did .
We <unk> and <unk> .
They 're all <unk> to their <unk> place .
<unk> the end of <unk> the <unk> will be again .
We <unk> it , and we <unk> data to <unk> or <unk> , and so our <unk> <unk> to discover what the <unk> are the universe .
Now , of course , in some way , these <unk> <unk> the <unk> value of science and engineering engineering engineering . It 's easy to <unk> .
I think that it 's so hard , the fact that it 's the value of things like <unk> .
I want to end with the words of a <unk> <unk> , <unk> , which , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> of the <unk> experiments of the <unk> , his <unk> was Michael <unk> , said , " It 's not so <unk> for the idea of the human mind as the ideas of the <unk> that the ideas of science are <unk> , that our <unk> are <unk> , and that there are not new <unk> . "
Thank you .
I want to start <unk> to <unk> when , from children , <unk> with <unk> .
As we <unk> and <unk> , <unk> and <unk> and <unk> , we <unk> and <unk> , actually , we 're going to think and <unk> problems .
The <unk> <unk> is <unk> <unk> to the way that most of the world around us .
So , from <unk> <unk> from the <unk> of our <unk> with <unk> , and I <unk> <unk> , and I started <unk> , " And if we use a computer , instead of having the only <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> as a <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> on a <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> on a <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> to <unk> , that that
and <unk> to our <unk> ?
The question was so interesting to <unk> that I decided to explore the answer , building <unk> .
In a few words , a <unk> is a <unk> computer as a <unk> .
In a few words , a <unk> is a <unk> computer as a <unk> .
You can <unk> with your hand , they can <unk> them , they can hear their <unk> , and they have a <unk> <unk> and a <unk> radio .
But <unk> , they 're <unk> objects , like <unk> , you can just <unk> <unk> .
<unk> is the example of a new <unk> <unk> for <unk> information .
And as they become more <unk> , <unk> of the movement , <unk> of the movement , of the other , as they become <unk> , <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> of the movement , the other , how we can explore and <unk> <unk> .
Let 's start with some simple example .
This <unk> is <unk> to show you about the video : if we <unk> it in a direction , the video <unk> , so if we <unk> it in a <unk> .
These <unk> <unk> are <unk> of others .
If you <unk> them , you 're <unk> to what they 're going to .
If they 're <unk> , they can <unk> it and they can <unk> a little bit .
If they 're <unk> , they can <unk> it and they can <unk> a little bit .
They also <unk> their movement and <unk> .
We then realized that one of the interesting <unk> of the <unk> was the <unk> to be able to use common data on the <unk> example , a color as if it was a <unk> .
In this case , we have three <unk> <unk> like <unk> <unk> and I can <unk> it to <unk> the color , where they <unk> .
and I can <unk> it for the color in the central where you 're <unk> .
If you too much , we can <unk> it a little bit .
I 'm also <unk> possibilities to <unk> , like <unk> , and <unk> , where people can try and <unk> where people can try things , and they <unk> the results immediately .
Now I 'm --
This is a <unk> sequence that I do with a <unk> program .
Here we have a <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> , at any <unk> <unk> a letter to <unk> each <unk> , <unk> , every <unk> , <unk> , every <unk> <unk> a letter to any <unk> , and while I <unk> <unk> <unk> in him .
Then , after about 30 seconds , you get <unk> , and you have a new <unk> of <unk> and new possibilities to try .
Thank you .
Here 's <unk> children in <unk> <unk> to the <unk> <unk> , I did that in the <unk> and I <unk> it .
They 're very <unk> .
And one of the interesting things of this kind of <unk> is that you don 't have to give people a lot of <unk> .
I just say , " I <unk> <unk> , " and they know exactly what to do .
Here 's other people who are going to <unk> it .
This is our <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , there .
It actually wanted to <unk> .
They were just <unk> , for him .
Now , this is a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
We wanted to build a tool for the <unk> . He 's <unk> .
It can <unk> new characters in the scene , <unk> their <unk> .
It can <unk> new characters in the scene , <unk> their <unk> .
So here 's , it 's going to get out .
<unk> : The sun is <unk> .
<unk> : Now , he brought a <unk> in the scene .
<unk> : The <unk> <unk> .
<unk> work ! Yeah !
So , <unk> <unk> and <unk> can <unk> the characters --
<unk> : <unk> !
<unk> your story .
<unk> : <unk> !
<unk> : It 's a story with the open , and it can decide he 's going to decide how to <unk> .
<unk> : It 's a story with the open , and it can decide he 's going to decide how to <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> away , <unk> .
<unk> : The last example I have the time to show you is a tool that I recently had a <unk> , to <unk> and <unk> music .
It 's a tool that 's a recently <unk> , to <unk> and <unk> music .
The <unk> here are <unk> <unk> as <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> of these have four different <unk> , and you can choose which to use .
You can also <unk> these <unk> in a <unk> <unk> to your <unk> .
And we just <unk> out doing a <unk> <unk> and a sequence .
These are actually <unk> you can get out of the live , like <unk> and <unk> .
I 'm going to <unk> it to a particular sound and then <unk> to <unk> .
And then there are the effects effects of and <unk> , which <unk> the entire sequence .
<unk> how it works .
<unk> : <unk> : <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Now , I 'm going to take a <unk> line .
<unk> : <unk> : Now , I <unk> <unk> <unk> --
<unk> : And now I 'm going to <unk> the <unk> to the <unk> , so I can control the effect of the live .
<unk> : <unk> : I can <unk> the entire sequence of time or on the side .
<unk> : And now we 're going to <unk> the <unk> to give more <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> : I can <unk> the sequence of the flight .
So I don 't have to <unk> , but I can <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> ,
And now , finally , I can <unk> the entire sequence <unk> on the left the <unk> <unk> .
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is building new <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> to how our brain work and body .
And today , I had time to show you one of the results of this path , and also some possibilities that we 're trying to bring out from the lab .
The concept that I want to <unk> is that it 's <unk> this new generation of objects to <unk> the <unk> media , which <unk> information in our world in the way that we want .
Thank you very much .
I 'm not going to see the time to talk with all of you .
I 'm a <unk> .
<unk> books is my <unk> , but it 's more than this , of course .
It 's also the love and the <unk> of my life .
And I don 't like that it can change .
But , I said , this particular , something happened to my life and my career , which led me to <unk> the whole relationship with this work .
The particular thing is that I wrote this book , this <unk> called " <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
And the result is that everywhere , now , people <unk> me as if I was <unk> .
<unk> -- <unk> , <unk> .
<unk> to me now everybody <unk> and say , " You don 't fear of you not be able to do it better ?
You don 't fear to keep writing for the whole life without able to be able to create a book that could <unk> to somebody ? "
<unk> that can <unk> to someone ? "
It 's <unk> , you know .
But it could go worse , except that I remember , over 20 years ago , when I started to say people -- I was a <unk> -- I wanted to be a <unk> .
I 'm going to <unk> the same <unk> <unk> from fear .
And people said , " Don 't you know I don 't know to be able to success ?
You don 't fear the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> you ?
You 're not afraid to do this <unk> for the whole life without anything that anything you 've ever come out and die on a <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> ? "
So , you know .
The answer -- the short answer to all these questions is , " Yeah . "
Yeah , I fear of all those things .
I 've always had fear .
And I fear of many other things that people can 't <unk> .
As <unk> and other things <unk> .
But , as much as it is to write what I thought and <unk> is why ?
Is that <unk> ?
It 's <unk> that anybody who <unk> <unk> to be <unk> by a job that you feel like a <unk> to do .
But what 's so particular in the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to <unk> health <unk> <unk> in a way that other <unk> don 't do ?
As my father , for example , he was a <unk> <unk> and I didn 't remember once in his <unk> , in the 40 years of <unk> <unk> where he was asked to be <unk> ?
It was never -- that <unk> of <unk> <unk> , John , how does it ?
<unk> 't that way , <unk> ?
<unk> , engineers <unk> like <unk> <unk> <unk> .
We <unk> , we have enough this <unk> , and not only <unk> , but <unk> of all these kinds of <unk> , we have this <unk> to be <unk> <unk> .
And they 're not going to be able to look at the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> that , only in the <unk> century , <unk> , <unk> young and often to them them .
And the ones that don 't have <unk> to be really <unk> by their <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , before I died , in the last <unk> said , " Every <unk> my book <unk> me a little bit more , " A extraordinary <unk> about the work of their lives .
But we didn 't <unk> when we say that , why we heard this stuff so long that we have completely <unk> and <unk> the <unk> that creativity and <unk> are in some way <unk> and <unk> that creativity are in some way <unk> and the art , finally to <unk> .
And the question I want to <unk> you to all here is : you agree with this idea ?
I 'm going to tell you this thing -- because it 's also <unk> from a <unk> distance to me , that 's all right to do this <unk> .
I think it 's <unk> .
And I think it 's also <unk> and I don 't want to <unk> you to <unk> in the next century .
I think it 's better <unk> to <unk> our great <unk> to live .
And I certainly know that , in my case -- it would be very <unk> to start <unk> to that <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> in which I 'm in my career .
<unk> -- <unk> , I 'm a young , I 'm pretty young , I have about 40 years .
I still have about four <unk> of work in me .
And it 's very <unk> that anything that 's going to happen to <unk> , and then it 's going to be <unk> from the last book .
<unk> <unk> , because we 're all about , because we 're all <unk> here -- is <unk> that my biggest success is to my <unk> .
Oh , <unk> , <unk> , thinking !
You know this is the kind of thinking that brings a person to start <unk> <unk> to the nine of the morning and I don 't want to do it .
I want to keep going to do this work that I love .
So , the question gets , how ?
And so it seems to me , after many <unk> , that the way of working on and <unk> is to create a <unk> <unk> <unk> , OK ?
I have to get to find a <unk> distance of security between me , which I 'm <unk> , and my <unk> <unk> on what the <unk> <unk> and <unk> for the last year models as a <unk> , to try to find out through time , trying to find other society , to find out out through time , trying to find other society to see if you have better ideas and more <unk> .
about how to help people <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> of creativity .
And that research has brought me to the <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
<unk> because they were <unk> and then <unk> back .
<unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> -- people don 't believe that creativity <unk> creativity , OK ?
It <unk> that creativity was this <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> to men from some <unk> and <unk> to a <unk> <unk> and <unk> , for reasons and <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> of creativity " <unk> . "
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> to have a <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> were the same idea , but they <unk> that kind of spirit without a <unk> .
And that 's <unk> , because the <unk> didn 't really feel that a <unk> was somebody particularly smart .
I thought that a <unk> was this kind of <unk> <unk> that <unk> literally , in the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , and that <unk> out of <unk> <unk> , and that <unk> out of <unk> <unk> , and that <unk> out of <unk> <unk> the work of the artist and <unk> the result of that work .
<unk> <unk> , here is the distance of which I talk about -- that <unk> <unk> <unk> that you <unk> you from the results of your work .
And everybody thought that was so that it was , right ?
So , the <unk> artists were <unk> by <unk> things , like the too <unk> , right ?
If your work was <unk> , you wouldn 't have to <unk> all the <unk> , everybody <unk> that <unk> had been <unk> by this <unk> <unk> .
If your work is not <unk> , it was all your <unk> , right ?
Everybody thought that was your <unk> to be a <unk> .
And so people <unk> <unk> creativity <unk> for a long time .
Then the <unk> <unk> and all <unk> , and we <unk> this great idea ; we put the human <unk> on the middle of the universe and the center without any more space and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> the <unk> and <unk> and no longer <unk> space to <unk> the <unk> .
This was the <unk> principle <unk> and people started thinking that creativity <unk> <unk> completely from <unk> .
And for the first time in the history , they <unk> to this or the artist as a <unk> <unk> than a <unk> person with <unk> .
And I have to say , I think it was a big <unk> .
I think that I 'm going to ask somebody , a simple person to believe that it 's like a <unk> , <unk> and <unk> of all the <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> and <unk> is a <unk> responsibility .
It 's like to some of <unk> the sun .
<unk> and <unk> completely <unk> and <unk> all these <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> all these <unk> <unk> on the <unk> .
And I think it was this pressure to <unk> the artists in the <unk> 500 years .
And , if that 's true , and I think that it 's , the question gets , and now ?
Can we <unk> it ?
We could go back to a <unk> understanding of the relationship between human and <unk> <unk> .
Or maybe not .
Maybe we can 't <unk> 500 years of thinking in a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And there 's probably probably people in the audience who <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> on the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , you <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , you <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , you know , <unk> , <unk> , you <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , you <unk> , <unk> , you <unk> , <unk> , you <unk> , <unk> , you <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , you do that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
You probably don 't <unk> all about this .
But the question I want to <unk> is -- why don 't it ?
Why don 't we <unk> this way ?
Because it has more than any other thing I 've ever heard about to explain the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> process .
A process that , as anybody who ever <unk> to do something -- so , so , everybody -- knows , you know , you don 't <unk> .
And in fact , it can sometimes be completely <unk> .
I did this <unk> <unk> with the extraordinary <unk> <unk> , who has now 90 years , but it was a <unk> for the whole life and said that during his <unk> <unk> , <unk> out in the <unk> <unk> , <unk> out in the <unk> <unk> , <unk> out in the <unk> <unk> , <unk> out in the <unk> .
He said , it was like a <unk> <unk> of air .
And that <unk> <unk> to her from the <unk> .
I <unk> it , because he <unk> <unk> the land under its feet .
I decided to have only one thing to do and that point , and he was , " <unk> as a <unk> . "
And so he <unk> to the house and <unk> from this <unk> , and it wouldn 't have to do anything that you could take a piece of paper and a pretty quickly <unk> , as the <unk> , <unk> and <unk> on the page .
<unk> times , we didn 't have to be enough , so <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> without being able to get home and <unk> through the <unk> , and she would <unk> it through the <unk> , looking for , as she said , " another <unk> . "
Then there were those times -- this piece never <unk> -- there were some of the moments when he was almost <unk> , right ?
So , he was <unk> and he was looking for the <unk> and <unk> the <unk> through , and he <unk> a <unk> just in the while he was <unk> , and then he said , that was like if he was <unk> with the other hand and <unk> .
<unk> the tail <unk> from the tail and <unk> it in its body and <unk> on the page .
And in these cases , the <unk> would have been <unk> on the <unk> page and <unk> , but the <unk> , the last word to the first .
So when you <unk> it -- it 's <unk> , it 's exactly <unk> to my <unk> process .
Not the whole process of my <unk> -- I 'm not a <unk> .
I 'm a <unk> , and my way of <unk> is ; I <unk> every day and work and work and <unk> on the <unk> .
But even me in my <unk> , I <unk> against that thing , sometimes .
And I 'm sure that many of you <unk> it .
You know , even if the work and ideas I <unk> <unk> from a certain source , I couldn 't <unk> <unk> .
And what is this thing ?
And how can we <unk> it in it , we don 't lose your head , but rather , what 's it <unk> to do ?
As I <unk> , the best example I <unk> that I have is the <unk> <unk> <unk> , which I <unk> <unk> years ago for a <unk> .
<unk> <unk> of this , and you know , <unk> , for the <unk> of life was the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> these <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> these <unk> <unk> <unk> .
But then he was <unk> , and a day while he was <unk> on a <unk> <unk> <unk> , he <unk> all for him .
<unk> <unk> , and all of a <unk> <unk> this little <unk> of <unk> , which comes in his head as <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , and <unk> , and you know , and it wants , you know , it 's wonderful , and the <unk> , but he doesn 't know how to <unk> .
It has no <unk> piece , it has no <unk> , it has no <unk> .
So he starts to hear this kind of old <unk> to grow in him , like , " I 'm going to lose , and <unk> <unk> from this <unk> song .
I 'm not enough <unk> , and I can 't <unk> . "
And instead of going to <unk> , they <unk> .
<unk> the whole process and did something completely new .
I just <unk> the sky and said , " <unk> , don 't see that I 'm <unk> ? "
" It seems to you say a song now ?
If you really want to <unk> , you 're going to get <unk> when I can take care of you .
<unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> else today .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . "
And the <unk> process after this .
Not the work , the work was still <unk> as always .
But the process , and the <unk> <unk> that <unk> was <unk> when he <unk> the <unk> , the <unk> that <unk> out of him , and he <unk> it back from , he was <unk> that it didn 't have to be a <unk> thing and <unk> .
But I was <unk> this , wonderful <unk> <unk> a conversation between <unk> and this <unk> thing that <unk> and <unk> thing that was <unk> and <unk> that was not <unk> .
So how much the <unk> story to change a little bit of the way I <unk> and already <unk> a time .
This idea , I was when I was <unk> " <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , " and I <unk> , " and I <unk> in one of the <unk> that we 're all working on something , and we 're working on , and we 're working on , and we 're not going to start thinking that it 's going to be a <unk> , that 's the book written .
Not just <unk> , just the <unk> book wrote .
And I started thinking about <unk> this project .
But then I <unk> to <unk> that I 'm going to <unk> it up and <unk> .
So I <unk> my face on the <unk> and I <unk> my <unk> to a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And I said to <unk> , " <unk> , what , both , we know that if this book is not going to be <unk> , right ?
Because as you see , I 'm <unk> all that I have , I have no more than that .
So if you want it to be better , you have to <unk> and do your part .
OK . But if you don 't do that , you know what , I 'm going to do anything .
I started writing the same because it 's my work .
And I 'd like to be <unk> that it was <unk> that I 've been <unk> to do my part . " Because finally , so OK -- <unk> <unk> does in the <unk> of the North Africa , people <unk> <unk> to <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> of the moon , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> and hours to <unk> .
And they were always <unk> , because the <unk> were <unk> and they were <unk> .
But every once once , I <unk> , something <unk> , and one of these <unk> artists actually <unk> .
And I know you 're talking about , because I know you 've all seen , at some point , a <unk> like that .
It was like the time , and the <unk> <unk> through a kind of <unk> and it was not doing anything different from the <unk> , like the <unk> <unk> before , but it <unk> .
And all of a sudden , not only as a human .
But they <unk> out of the <unk> and <unk> in the fire of the <unk> .
And when this <unk> , the <unk> , the people <unk> what was , he <unk> with her name .
<unk> your hands and <unk> to <unk> , " <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , God , God . " God . " God . "
That 's God , you know .
<unk> <unk> <unk> -- when the <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> this <unk> with them and <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , " which , " which you can still feel in <unk> or in <unk> .
In <unk> , when an artist has done something impossible and <unk> , " <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> -- a <unk> of God .
And it 's <unk> because we need it .
But , the problem comes after day , for the <unk> itself , when you <unk> and <unk> that are 11 11 of the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> of God is no longer .
It 's just a <unk> with a lot of <unk> , and maybe never <unk> to <unk> to that <unk> .
And maybe nobody <unk> the name of God still as <unk> , and so what it has to do with his life ?
It 's hard .
This is one of the most <unk> <unk> to do in a <unk> life .
But maybe it 's not to be so <unk> if you 're not believe , <unk> , that the <unk> <unk> of your being you 're from yourself .
But let me just just <unk> that you get data into a <unk> source of this <unk> part of your life that you have to <unk> .
And , you know , if we think it all changes .
And so I started to <unk> , and it 's certainly how I <unk> it for several months during the <unk> of the book that I would soon soon be , the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> ,
And what I 'm going to <unk> when I feel <unk> from this is , I don 't fear .
Don 't <unk> . I just <unk> your work .
<unk> <unk> for your side , any one can be .
If your work is <unk> , <unk> .
If the <unk> , you 're going to <unk> you <unk> <unk> some kind of <unk> , for only a moment through your <unk> , then you know , " <unk> ! "
<unk> , you do the same your <unk> .
And " <unk> ! " You 're going to <unk> .
I think that and I think that it 's <unk> .
" <unk> ! " <unk> ! " <unk> <unk> to you the same , even for <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Thank you .
Thank you .
<unk> <unk> : <unk> !
As you know , I 've been talking about some of these projects on the human genome , what it can <unk> and discovery new <unk> of genes .
We 're going to <unk> a new path . We started <unk> biology and now starting from that digital code , we 're <unk> in a new <unk> of biology , <unk> and <unk> life .
We always have been trying to <unk> large questions .
" <unk> is life ? " It 's something that many <unk> , I think they have <unk> to understand at <unk> levels .
We 've tried a lot of <unk> , <unk> to the <unk> terms .
We 're <unk> for almost 20 years .
When we <unk> the human genome <unk> to go from the <unk> world of biology in the digital world .
Now , we can <unk> life , or create new life from this digital universe ?
This is the map of a little <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , which is the species from the <unk> genome between those that can <unk> in the lab .
And we tried to reduce <unk> the genome to <unk> one even smaller .
We 're able to <unk> a <unk> of the about 500 that are here .
But when we take a look at its map , it 's <unk> simple than our .
<unk> , this is simple .
But when we look at all the genes that we can <unk> , one at a time , is very <unk> that this can bring to a <unk> cell .
So I thought the only way to <unk> was <unk> this <unk> so that it would <unk> to <unk> some of these questions .
So we started the <unk> of the " can we <unk> a <unk> ? "
Can the chemistry <unk> to produce these big molecules that we 've never been able to do before ?
And , in case , we can make a <unk> ?
A <unk> is just a <unk> piece of <unk> <unk> .
The speed with which we 're able to <unk> life is <unk> to <unk> <unk> .
Our ability to write the code , instead of <unk> , but it 's <unk> .
And our <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> .
We <unk> over 15 years ago .
The process has <unk> a lot of <unk> , <unk> with a <unk> <unk> before he <unk> the early experiments .
But we found that DNA <unk> is very difficult .
There are <unk> of thousands of cars in the world that <unk> little <unk> of DNA , of <unk> <unk> , and it 's a <unk> process : the <unk> is a long longer , <unk> there are .
So we had to develop a new <unk> for <unk> , and <unk> the <unk> .
And this was our first <unk> , starting from the digital <unk> genome to <unk> <unk> <unk> .
It 's a little <unk> <unk> that bacteria <unk> .
We designed the <unk> , <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> and <unk> a <unk> of DNA <unk> .
The interesting part is when we took this piece of <unk> <unk> , and we <unk> it in bacteria , the bacteria have <unk> to read this code and <unk> .
The <unk> particles have been <unk> by cells , they <unk> back and they <unk> <unk> .
I talked about recently with members of the <unk> <unk> industry that they certainly certainly <unk> this model .
They have more than you .
I think this is a situation where software can actually build its own <unk> in a <unk> system .
But we 're going to do the largest things .
We had to build the whole <unk> of the <unk> .
They 're more than <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
So we thought about <unk> in the size of the <unk> , so that we can change the <unk> to understand what the <unk> of a <unk> cell .
<unk> is <unk> , and if we <unk> with <unk> information in a computer , these have to be very <unk> .
When we <unk> this genome for the first time in <unk> , it was a <unk> for every 10 <unk> <unk> <unk> .
We found , <unk> , 30 <unk> . If you were used that original sequence , we would never be able to do it .
A part of the process is to design <unk> <unk> that <unk> with all the other <unk> <unk> of <unk> to build smaller <unk> <unk> that <unk> together .
I 'm going to be <unk> here .
You probably read that it <unk> us .
<unk> <unk> : We have a <unk> code <unk> on four <unk> : A , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> of those <unk> <unk> together , <unk> <unk> , and there 's a <unk> order to <unk> every <unk> .
So we can use the code for writing words , <unk> , <unk> .
What we did was in the beginning was <unk> .
Some of them were <unk> by the fact that it wasn 't <unk> .
We designed these <unk> to just <unk> <unk> with <unk> .
There are <unk> that we <unk> them and <unk> <unk> .
And we started to <unk> parts , <unk> with <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> in a way to <unk> <unk> <unk> .
But at every step , we produced these <unk> in <unk> so that we 're <unk> <unk> because we 're trying to create a very <unk> <unk> <unk> like you you 'll see in a minute .
We 're trying to <unk> the process .
So this seems to <unk> a <unk> <unk> .
When we start these <unk> <unk> very <unk> , more than 100 <unk> <unk> , they 're not going to be <unk> directly in the <unk> <unk> .
You get to the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> biology .
So we have <unk> other <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> , which is <unk> called <unk> <unk> , which in biology <unk> to <unk> the DNA that they can <unk> the <unk> .
Here 's an example .
This <unk> , called <unk> <unk> , can <unk> three million <unk> .
You can see in the <unk> <unk> as its <unk> is <unk> .
<unk> -- 24 hours is just <unk> exactly like it was before .
<unk> thousands of organisms that are able to do that .
These organisms can completely <unk> .
We 're going to live under <unk> .
I 'm absolutely sure life <unk> in space , and they <unk> to find new <unk> of water .
Actually , NASA 's shown that this happens .
This is an image of the <unk> that we 've built with these <unk> , just using these <unk> , just using these <unk> , just using these <unk> <unk> design .
The <unk> <unk> <unk> .
This image was not <unk> with a <unk> <unk> , but with a <unk> <unk> .
It 's a <unk> so big that we can <unk> with a <unk> <unk> .
These are pictures that <unk> a period of about six seconds .
This is the <unk> that we did a little time ago .
They 're more than <unk> <unk> code .
It 's the largest <unk> of a <unk> <unk> ever <unk> by man .
It has a <unk> <unk> <unk> to 300 million .
If you <unk> it with a <unk> 10 without spaces , we would just <unk> pages to <unk> this code .
Now , how do we make it work ? How can we <unk> it ?
Of course , through a virus is a <unk> <unk> .
It 's a little bit more <unk> when you use of the bacteria .
It 's <unk> even when it comes from <unk> cells like our : you just <unk> the <unk> and <unk> another , which is basically the <unk> process .
In <unk> , the <unk> is instead of <unk> , but we <unk> <unk> that we are able to do a <unk> <unk> of a cell to another cell <unk> .
We <unk> a <unk> <unk> from a kind of <unk> .
<unk> are different than men from <unk> .
We <unk> some <unk> in a more <unk> way that we could choose to choose what this <unk> .
And then he <unk> it with the <unk> in a way that <unk> all the <unk> .
And when we put it in the cell was <unk> and <unk> our <unk> <unk> the new <unk> went into the new <unk> , went into the cell .
And I <unk> <unk> that we didn 't want to go beyond , but we tried to <unk> more .
This is one of the largest <unk> of evolution .
We found that <unk> species have <unk> a second or a third <unk> somewhere , <unk> , <unk> in a second thousands of new <unk> to that species .
So who thinks about evolution as one <unk> only <unk> at the time they <unk> not the <unk> of biology .
We <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> that was in the cell didn 't <unk> one .
The <unk> <unk> that we <unk> it has <unk> .
It 's <unk> , and it <unk> the other <unk> as <unk> material , <unk> it , and we <unk> with only the cell and the new <unk> .
It 's blue because of the genes we <unk> .
And in a short <unk> of time , all of the <unk> of a kind of <unk> , and it <unk> of all in a new species , <unk> on the new software that we <unk> in the cell .
All the <unk> are <unk> , the <unk> are <unk> , and when you <unk> the code that we <unk> exactly to what we <unk> you .
Now , this may be <unk> <unk> , but <unk> software DNA , we can change things in a pretty <unk> way .
Now , I 've already <unk> that maybe it 's not about <unk> -- but of progress , from three million years and a half million years of evolution , and I 've already said that maybe we 're going to create a new version of the <unk> <unk> that we 're going to be <unk> new species on this process .
Why do that ?
I think it 's pretty <unk> when we think of our <unk> .
We 're going to go from six billion and a half billion people who are <unk> billion in the next 40 years .
Just to give you an example : I was born in <unk> .
Now there are three people on the planet to <unk> <unk> in <unk> ; there 's going to be four .
We 're <unk> now to find food , <unk> water and <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , for six billion people .
We 're even <unk> to do it for nine billion .
<unk> <unk> billion <unk> , over 30 billion <unk> .
That means percent million <unk> a day .
When we try to find <unk> <unk> , or any kind of process to <unk> , it will be a huge challenge .
In more we have to realize that the <unk> of CO2 from these materials that <unk> in the atmosphere .
<unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> around the world , we have a <unk> with about 20 million genes , and I like to think that are the <unk> <unk> for the future .
The <unk> industry only a <unk> <unk> , and you think about how many different things are <unk> out .
Our <unk> here are <unk> data from the <unk> reality and our imagination .
Now we have <unk> , thank you with these <unk> <unk> <unk> , able to create what we call <unk> <unk> .
We 're able to build a big robot that can produce a million <unk> a day .
Think of <unk> these 20 million <unk> or <unk> to <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> or <unk> , new <unk> , new <unk> , we can change , because of a little team , and create more biology now that in the last 20 years of science .
And it 's just a <unk> <unk> .
We can choose to <unk> , <unk> <unk> chemistry or <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
This is a <unk> of some software <unk> that we 're working on to be able to <unk> and design species to design .
Well , we don 't know how they 're going to be .
We know exactly what their <unk> code .
Now we 're <unk> on the <unk> generation .
You 've seen that <unk> <unk> from <unk> was an <unk> experiment .
We <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> that we 're soon from <unk> to <unk> <unk> , like <unk> or different kinds of <unk> .
But the only way that biology can have a big impact without <unk> <unk> the cost of food and <unk> the <unk> would <unk> the CO2 and <unk> would be <unk> CO2 as we 're working on , and we 're working for cells that we 're working for cells that first , and we think that the first <unk> <unk> in about 18 months .
<unk> <unk> with CO2 is a <unk> , but in our <unk> <unk> , we found different <unk> .
This is a <unk> that we <unk> in <unk> .
We <unk> in the deep ocean , about <unk> meters of the water <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> using hydrogen <unk> like energy .
We 're trying to understand whether we can <unk> CO2 , which can easily be <unk> through <unk> , <unk> that CO2 in <unk> , to drive this process .
So , we think that we might be able to <unk> what the basic question that the basic question that what life is , we have to <unk> the <unk> goal of the <unk> industry .
<unk> . If you can 't do it from TED , where can you ?
We have a <unk> source of energy .
<unk> , we 're working for <unk> <unk> to create <unk> .
You 've seen this year with flu , we always come back to a year and with a dollar in less when it 's about finding the right .
I think that what you can change is <unk> <unk> in <unk> .
So , that 's how the future may start to look <unk> , now , the tree of evolution , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and then <unk> cells .
We 're so much <unk> to <unk> people .
Our purpose is to make a long enough to <unk> . Thank you very long to try to <unk> . Thank you very much .
I 'm going to show you , the <unk> possible , some <unk> , some <unk> work , a new technology that we have brought to <unk> <unk> , and then almost a year ago .
It 's a environment where you can <unk> is at the local level that you can <unk> with a huge amount of data .
Here we 're seeing <unk> <unk> <unk> with a kind of <unk> <unk> and <unk> , for a <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> the images .
And no matter how big the amount of information that we see , how big it is these <unk> of data or data .
Most of them are common pictures , but this is a <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> in the <unk> of <unk> , and <unk> in the <unk> of 300 <unk> .
It 's not any difference because the only thing that <unk> the <unk> of a system like this is the number of <unk> on your screen at any time . It 's also a very <unk> architecture .
This is a whole book , example of data not images .
This is <unk> <unk> <unk> . Every <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
To <unk> that it 's just about <unk> and not images , we can do something like that , to actually see that it 's a real <unk> <unk> , not a picture of the text , not of a picture .
It could be a way to read a little bit of a <unk> .
I don 't <unk> that .
This is an <unk> example . It 's a <unk> example .
Every image of the very big <unk> in the beginning .
And it really gives you the pleasure and the beautiful experience of reading the real <unk> version of a <unk> or a <unk> , which is for nature a <unk> .
We also did something with the <unk> of this particular number of The <unk> .
We created a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
If you want to see the <unk> of this <unk> , you can see here .
Or other models , or even <unk> <unk> .
And this really <unk> some of these ideas to <unk> the <unk> of space on the screen .
I thought this <unk> to put in the <unk> and other <unk> like that , you can 't be <unk> .
Of course , the <unk> is one of the most <unk> <unk> for this kind of technology .
And on this , I don 't want to lose time , if we don 't say that we have <unk> <unk> to do in this field .
These are all the streets in the <unk> <unk> over a <unk> image of NASA .
So now I 'm going to try and do something else .
This is now actually actually live on the web ; you can see it .
It 's a project called <unk> , which <unk> two different technologies .
One is <unk> and the other is a <unk> research that 's very interesting that made by <unk> <unk> , a <unk> student , a <unk> student of Washington , with <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And it 's alive on the web , <unk> <unk> .
You can <unk> when we do this this kind of <unk> , where we can go from an image to the other and have this kind of experience <unk> .
But the <unk> <unk> of the images here actually has a meaning .
And the <unk> <unk> of the computer <unk> these images together , so that they <unk> to <unk> places where they <unk> all <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> have been <unk> . And here you see some of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and these things are all <unk> on the <unk> level .
I don 't know if I have time to show you some other environment .
There are some much more <unk> .
I want to spend directly to one of the <unk> data , and this <unk> <unk> from a <unk> <unk> that we did for the first time to show you what we did is really the key behind this technology , the <unk> technology , <unk> . And it 's not <unk> as <unk> as a <unk> <unk> that we have in the website .
We had to <unk> <unk> and <unk> and so on .
This is a <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> images of <unk> in <unk> , other than <unk> and <unk> images of the <unk> and <unk> and <unk> . <unk> of these <unk> <unk> <unk> .
So they 're all <unk> images from <unk> and they 're all <unk> <unk> on this way .
And it 's possible to <unk> this <unk> way .
You know , I would never have thought that I 'd end up to work for <unk> .
It 's very <unk> <unk> this kind of <unk> here .
I think that it 's a lot of different types of <unk> : from the <unk> to those <unk> <unk> , a <unk> number , <unk> <unk> together in this environment .
And if I can , I can , I 'll try and <unk> those <unk> .
Many of them are <unk> by <unk> , <unk> .
<unk> here is a series of photographs -- <unk> .
This is a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
We can go from the <unk> to <unk> physics of this environment .
The <unk> point is that we can do with social environment . This is now <unk> data from the whole memory of how we <unk> the earth , from the <unk> of view and <unk> all that data together .
All of those pictures become <unk> together , the <unk> of the <unk> .
You have a model of the whole <unk> that we <unk> .
Think of this as the <unk> of the work of <unk> <unk> on Earth .
It 's something that 's going to <unk> as people , and the <unk> that they <unk> for who <unk> it with the use .
Their pictures are <unk> with <unk> <unk> from other people .
If somebody comes the idea of <unk> all these <unk> <unk> the name , my <unk> picture of <unk> <unk> <unk> , you 're <unk> <unk> all of that data , and I can use it as a <unk> <unk> to <unk> in that space , in that <unk> , using the pictures of everybody , and having a social experience like <unk> and <unk> .
Of course , a <unk> of all this is <unk> models of every interesting part of the earth , <unk> not just <unk> from <unk> <unk> and images and <unk> images , but from the memory .
Thank you very much .
Chris Anderson : I understand ? What 's your software <unk> to do is that , at some point , in the next few years , all of the photographs that 's going to be <unk> together ?
<unk> : Yeah . What 's doing is basically discover .
It 's creating <unk> , if you want , between images .
And it 's <unk> at the content of the images .
And what it gets very interesting if you think about the <unk> of information that a lot of these <unk> images .
As you do a <unk> <unk> , you <unk> the <unk> and the text on the page has a lot of information about the images of the images of the picture .
Now , what happens if that 's going on if that picture <unk> to all your pictures ?
So the amount of <unk> <unk> and the amount of <unk> that <unk> is really huge . It 's a <unk> effect .
CA : <unk> , it 's really incredible . <unk> .
<unk> : I 'm going to tell you a lot .
One of the main <unk> when you <unk> and one of the <unk> research is the <unk> to live in who has no <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> the past in the wind , the <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> of plants .
<unk> to think that <unk> <unk> <unk> still beyond the <unk> <unk> , or that <unk> <unk> <unk> are still <unk> <unk> , or that <unk> <unk> <unk> still <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> , to <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> , to remember the <unk> of the <unk> , and that the idea that the world in which we live in which is not in a sense , but it 's only one of reality , but it 's a reality of reality .
the <unk> of a particular <unk> of <unk> choices that our <unk> has done , good or bad , many <unk> .
And , of course , everybody <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Everybody <unk> . <unk> .
We 're <unk> to <unk> <unk> .
We have to deal with the <unk> of death , so we don 't <unk> if we were <unk> and <unk> --
We all have an art .
What 's the <unk> is the particular <unk> of the song , the <unk> of every culture .
It doesn 't matter that matter the <unk> of the <unk> , or the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , or the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , or a <unk> in <unk> <unk> , or a <unk> in the heart of the <unk> .
He was my <unk> <unk> <unk> , a month ago , or a <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> , on the <unk> , the <unk> mother of the world .
All these <unk> <unk> that there are other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , other ways of moving around the world .
And , if you 're going to be a moment , it 's a concept that it can give you hope .
<unk> , the <unk> of the world create a <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> that <unk> the planet and it 's important for the <unk> of the planet , as the <unk> <unk> note as <unk> <unk> .
And you can think of this <unk> <unk> as a <unk> and you can <unk> the <unk> of all the <unk> , the total <unk> of all the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> in being from human imagination .
<unk> is the fantastic <unk> of humanity .
It 's the <unk> of what we 're and what we can be as as <unk> species .
And <unk> the <unk> was <unk> <unk> <unk> was successful at <unk> and <unk> much faster .
<unk> <unk> , for example , <unk> that 50 percent of all species has been or is on the <unk> of the <unk> , just because it 's <unk> , or -- in the <unk> <unk> -- and you 're <unk> <unk> -- and you don 't even even even <unk> at the <unk> <unk> -- and that 's the <unk> diversity .
The <unk> of all that is , of course , the <unk> <unk> .
When you 're <unk> <unk> <unk> on this planet .
A language is not only <unk> by a <unk> or a series of rules of <unk> .
A language is the <unk> of the human spirit .
It 's the middle with which the <unk> of every culture comes in the material world .
Every language is a forest of the mind , a <unk> , a <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
And of those <unk> <unk> , while we 're here in <unk> , at least half is no longer <unk> in the <unk> of children .
They 're not going to be <unk> , which means , unless you 're dead , which is already <unk> .
What 's more <unk> than the <unk> of being <unk> by the <unk> , of being the last to talk a language , of not <unk> the <unk> of <unk> or <unk> the <unk> of <unk> ?
This <unk> <unk> was the state of somebody in the world every two weeks : every two weeks , a <unk> <unk> and door with him in the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And I know that some of you say , " <unk> 't that ?
The world wouldn 't be a better place if we all have the same language ? " <unk> , then we 're all <unk> . <unk> .
<unk> <unk> .
We 're going to <unk> what it means is not to talk about their own own language .
I 'd like to do you today to do a <unk> trip through the <unk> --
a little journey in the <unk> to give you a <unk> of what we 're <unk> .
Many of us <unk> that when I say " different ways of <unk> , I mean , I mean , I mean , it 's a lot of ways of <unk> .
<unk> for example this <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , which <unk> <unk> <unk> , which <unk> <unk> to the <unk> <unk> from the <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
It 's a <unk> that 's not able to <unk> the blue color from the green because the <unk> is <unk> in the <unk> , which we <unk> the <unk> .
They have a <unk> language and a <unk> rule , <unk> , <unk> <unk> . " <unk> " : you have to <unk> a different language .
And this has <unk> in the past <unk> , but the <unk> is that in these <unk> families where you 're talking to six or seven <unk> because of the <unk> <unk> <unk> nobody 's a language .
They were <unk> to listen and then I started talking .
<unk> one of the <unk> <unk> with which I lived , the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , an incredible <unk> that had the first <unk> in <unk> .
In <unk> , five <unk> have <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
They <unk> <unk> <unk> had never seen them from the top pictures that <unk> <unk> , <unk> that this <unk> of the <unk> forest had never seen anything .
They <unk> the pictures of the earth , they <unk> to <unk> a form or a <unk> , they didn 't <unk> anything , they <unk> that <unk> <unk> , and they <unk> the five <unk> with <unk> .
But <unk> not only to <unk> <unk> .
They <unk> themselves .
<unk> percent <unk> <unk> was <unk> by themselves .
We were <unk> to eight <unk> and we found two <unk> , and when we were <unk> to know , they <unk> that one of them was <unk> so that he died , and then they <unk> it . They <unk> it . They <unk> it . <unk> <unk> , every way , they had an incredible knowledge of the forest .
<unk> were able to recognize the animal <unk> from 40 <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , and I was <unk> a very interesting job when my <unk> <unk> <unk> me if I wanted to go to <unk> <unk> , if I wanted to go to <unk> in <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
To make sense of <unk> , I should have to understand the <unk> culture , and that <unk> is not <unk> .
It 's pretty much of a <unk> view of the world .
Very interesting .
If you 're going to <unk> the great <unk> , what would you <unk> me ?
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , etc .
A continent comes out , thinking , that <unk> Africa has no <unk> <unk> . And instead and yes , the <unk> is not something that the <unk> of these <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
What makes the <unk> <unk> is the <unk> relationship between life and death .
So <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> can be <unk> by the <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> and <unk> to the <unk> of the live in a way that <unk> the <unk> becomes the <unk> .
So , for <unk> <unk> to say " <unk> <unk> , you go to talk about God .
We <unk> in <unk> and <unk> God . "
And from the moment that you 're <unk> , is the spirit that <unk> you , how can you get you <unk> ?
So , they <unk> to these incredible events : <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a pretty strong <unk> of the power of the body when it 's <unk> in a state of <unk> <unk> .
I <unk> all the <unk> with which I 've lived the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , in the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> of the <unk> civilization that once <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
In a <unk> continent , this <unk> has never been <unk> by <unk> .
In <unk> , I 'm <unk> today from a <unk> , but their <unk> is extraordinary .
<unk> <unk> are <unk> by <unk> to <unk> <unk> for 18 years .
Two <unk> <unk> years <unk> of nine years <unk> that <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of the mother , now are <unk> in the <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
For all this time , they 're <unk> to the values of their society , values that they <unk> and only their <unk> <unk> <unk> -- or to say the <unk> <unk> .
And then , at the end of this incredible <unk> , they 're <unk> out and for the first time in their lives , they see an <unk> . And in that moment of <unk> <unk> , when the sun <unk> <unk> <unk> , when the sun <unk> <unk> , all that they have been <unk> out and <unk> .
" <unk> ? I said , " <unk> .
It 's <unk> . Now it 's <unk> . "
They 're called <unk> <unk> and they say that we , <unk> <unk> , we are the <unk> of the <unk> of the world .
This <unk> level is very important .
When we think about <unk> <unk> and the <unk> environment and the old history of <unk> <unk> , which is a <unk> concept in its <unk> or maybe <unk> <unk> and say that these <unk> are closer to Earth than us .
<unk> <unk> are not <unk> or <unk> by <unk> .
There 's no space for these things in the <unk> <unk> or in the <unk> <unk> , but because of time and <unk> , they created a <unk> of the Earth <unk> , they created a <unk> of the Earth , they have created a <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> , but on a <unk> <unk> <unk> : the concept that the Earth can live only because it 's <unk> .
What does that mean ?
I mean that a <unk> of the <unk> that <unk> <unk> the mountain is a <unk> spirit that <unk> the <unk> is a <unk> human being <unk> and a very <unk> relationship with the mountain or that place than a <unk> of the <unk> that <unk> a mountain of <unk> that <unk> <unk> a mountain of <unk> that <unk> <unk> that a mountain of <unk> is a <unk> <unk> to be <unk> .
which is a <unk> of a spirit or a <unk> is <unk> .
What 's interesting is the <unk> that <unk> the relationship between the <unk> and the natural world .
I grew up in the <unk> <unk> <unk> that the <unk> <unk> to be <unk> .
And that I made a human being different from my <unk> friends who believe that <unk> are the <unk> <unk> <unk> and the <unk> <unk> and the <unk> <unk> that live in the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
If we start <unk> that these <unk> can actually create different , they start to understand some of them . We could start to understand some of them . We would have this <unk> .
I <unk> this picture at <unk> in the <unk> <unk> .
Maybe some of you 've heard about <unk> , the most powerful <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> .
What makes the <unk> is not the potential <unk> of the <unk> , but its <unk> . It 's <unk> from two elements .
On one side , this <unk> <unk> that has a series of <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
<unk> the only <unk> <unk> <unk> a little bit that <unk> a little bit , and it 's <unk> with the <unk> of a <unk> 's family of <unk> <unk> said <unk> .
This <unk> <unk> <unk> , very similar to <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
If you 're going to see the <unk> <unk> <unk> , the <unk> that they 're doing a different <unk> of species , <unk> it <unk> .
<unk> that <unk> on the <unk> is a little bit of how to be <unk> by a <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> on a sea of electricity . <unk> 't create <unk> . It doesn 't create the <unk> of the reality .
I often <unk> with my <unk> , Richard <unk> <unk> , the man who <unk> the <unk> was <unk> , with his discovery of the <unk> <unk> in the <unk> .
<unk> my <unk> can 't be <unk> these <unk> as <unk> because if you 're done you can 't tell anybody anybody to be <unk> . <unk> . <unk> <unk> 't be <unk> because they 're <unk> from a <unk> that 's of course in the <unk> , <unk> .
It 's possible to <unk> only if you <unk> with other <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> .
Now it 's the nice : the <unk> that are <unk> in this <unk> are <unk> , the same kind of <unk> to <unk> the <unk> . The question <unk> <unk> : in a <unk> of <unk> species , like these <unk> to <unk> two <unk> <unk> <unk> , they don 't like that , but if you 're in this way , they create a <unk> version that 's <unk> <unk> .
We use the great <unk> of <unk> and <unk> , which can <unk> <unk> .
But if we <unk> , we 'll <unk> , we 'll <unk> . "
What does that mean ?
This <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , which <unk> <unk> in the forest , and that our eyes <unk> in the same species .
If you <unk> how to <unk> their <unk> <unk> , we 'll say , " I said , " No . "
The solution is : You take the <unk> <unk> in a night , <unk> <unk> <unk> with a different <unk> .
And with that you 're not going to <unk> , but it 's much more interesting than <unk> that <unk> <unk> .
Now , the problem is that the ones of us who have <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> them , but in a way to the <unk> of the history of the world , than our <unk> , and <unk> .
In fact , the <unk> century , in 300 years , we didn 't <unk> <unk> for its <unk> or <unk> <unk> , but rather like the <unk> was where we <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of the <unk> diversity and <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> of the planet . Now the problem is not the change .
All the <unk> through the <unk> have been <unk> in a <unk> for new possibilities .
And the problem is not the technology .
<unk> <unk> have no <unk> to be <unk> when they put <unk> and <unk> <unk> like <unk> have no <unk> to be <unk> when they <unk> <unk> , they <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
It 's not the change or the technology that <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> . It 's power .
The <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And if you look at the world , you know that these are not <unk> <unk> to <unk> .
They 're <unk> creatures and <unk> <unk> out of existence by <unk> forces that go beyond their ability to <unk> .
<unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> --
a <unk> <unk> <unk> , in <unk> <unk> , <unk> , which has been <unk> in the forest to a generation of the <unk> to a generation of the <unk> , where you can see the <unk> <unk> <unk> , where you can see the <unk> <unk> from the <unk> <unk> , which <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , where the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , where the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> ,
We started <unk> with the <unk> with the <unk> <unk> to the forest .
Or , in the case of <unk> , are the disease that are <unk> with the discovery of <unk> .
If we <unk> on the <unk> of the <unk> , where I 'm going to see the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of politics .
As <unk> <unk> , <unk> physics of a <unk> , is <unk> at the <unk> level , but <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> of the life of a <unk> , not only is <unk> , but <unk> <unk> in certain <unk> , because it 's part of the development .
And you can 't understand the <unk> of the <unk> until you get <unk> from the beginning .
I <unk> <unk> miles from <unk> in the <unk> China through the <unk> <unk> , <unk> to <unk> with a young <unk> , but only come to <unk> , I got to <unk> what the <unk> behind .
<unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> million people <unk> from the <unk> during the <unk> <unk> .
The father of this guy was <unk> at <unk> <unk> .
which means that it was <unk> in the Chinese <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> with <unk> <unk> in the <unk> that brought the <unk> in <unk> .
My mother was <unk> and her <unk> was being <unk> .
It was brought to <unk> in <unk> at the age of two <unk> , because he couldn 't have no <unk> .
The <unk> , who did the same , was <unk> in <unk> <unk> .
One day he <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> , and , for this <unk> , was <unk> to <unk> jobs for seven years .
The pain of <unk> can be <unk> , but the <unk> of the <unk> is <unk> present .
<unk> , all <unk> to a choice .
<unk> we live in the <unk> world or we want to <unk> the <unk> of diversity ?
The great <unk> <unk> , before he died , before he said that her largest fear was that , in our <unk> to this <unk> view of the world , not only <unk> the whole <unk> of the <unk> of the human imagination <unk> to a <unk> <unk> of thinking , but a day we <unk> us from a <unk> <unk> <unk> that there were other possibilities .
And it 's <unk> to remember that our species is <unk> for <unk> years .
The <unk> <unk> , who gave us agriculture , which he did <unk> us to the <unk> of the <unk> with the <unk> of the <unk> with the <unk> of the <unk> with the <unk> of <unk> , and we talk about <unk> years ago .
The <unk> world has to <unk> 300 years .
That <unk> story not to me that we have the answers to all the challenges that we <unk> to <unk> in <unk> to come .
When these <unk> <unk> of the world comes , it 's asked what it means to be human , <unk> with <unk> <unk> different .
And it 's in these answers that we all <unk> the chance of being what we are : a kind of <unk> , which has to <unk> that all the <unk> and all the <unk> can <unk> . And there are great moments of <unk> .
I <unk> this picture on the <unk> <unk> <unk> , when I went to <unk> <unk> with <unk> , and this man , <unk> , and this man , <unk> , he <unk> me the wonderful story of her .
The government <unk> was not always <unk> with the <unk> <unk> and in the <unk> for our <unk> , and we <unk> it in <unk> .
The <unk> of this man <unk> <unk> .
<unk> , <unk> for her life , <unk> <unk> the <unk> away all of the <unk> , and all of its <unk> .
You want to know that <unk> doesn 't <unk> the cold , <unk> .
The <unk> of <unk> were made of <unk> fish <unk> in the skin .
The <unk> of this man didn 't <unk> <unk> from night or <unk> .
It 's <unk> away , it <unk> the <unk> <unk> and <unk> in your hand . When I did it <unk> , they <unk> it with it , he <unk> it <unk> to <unk> .
He <unk> <unk> on the <unk> of this <unk> <unk> , and when <unk> <unk> , he <unk> a dog .
He <unk> the dog and created a <unk> , with the <unk> <unk> has created a <unk> , has <unk> another dog and <unk> on the <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> .
<unk> to talk about <unk> with nothing ? [ <unk> ] . And this , in different ways , [ <unk> ] is the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> and all the <unk> <unk> of the world .
<unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> government <unk> to <unk> the total <unk> area of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> together .
It 's their new <unk> . It 's called <unk> .
It 's a <unk> <unk> . It <unk> all the <unk> resources .
One example of how a <unk> can <unk> with its <unk> .
And , to end , I think it 's pretty <unk> at least who is in these <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> that they 're not not at all .
For somebody is home .
<unk> <unk> of the human imagination that we 're going to be <unk> . And for all of these children , like the dreams of our children , as the dreams of our children , they become part of the <unk> of hope .
To end , we <unk> <unk> , we 're <unk> that <unk> never to anything .
I 'm going to say that <unk> --
<unk> <unk> are not <unk> , but we believe that stories can change the world , and maybe we 're the best <unk> to tell the stories of the world . Every month our website <unk> <unk> million <unk> .
<unk> <unk> our <unk> <unk> .
Our <unk> are <unk> from millions of people .
Our work is <unk> in the <unk> to bring our public in places places that <unk> <unk> from which <unk> <unk> <unk> from which they were <unk> and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , once the central <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> : the world of <unk> diversity , and we have to find a <unk> of life in <unk> and <unk> .
where we <unk> of all the <unk> can <unk> our <unk> <unk> .
Thank you .
I 'm going to talk about some of the things that I 've written in this book that I hope you 've heard about and <unk> a few <unk> , in case you don 't <unk> them .
I want to start with what I call the <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> of what ?
The <unk> <unk> of all the <unk> <unk> <unk> . The <unk> <unk> <unk> : " If we want to <unk> the <unk> of our citizens , " The way to do it is to <unk> the <unk> . "
The reason is , from one side , in fact that freedom is in itself , is useful , <unk> , <unk> for human beings .
<unk> else is in fact that if we 're <unk> , each of us can act to do all of what our <unk> is <unk> , without any that we 're going to <unk> our <unk> , without anybody who who 's <unk> .
The way to <unk> the freedom is to <unk> the choice .
More choices people have , more <unk> are <unk> , and more is their <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> is their <unk> .
This is , <unk> , it 's so <unk> <unk> in the society that nobody <unk> to <unk> in <unk> .
And it 's also <unk> <unk> in our lives .
I 'm going to show you some examples of what progress has made possible .
This is my <unk> . It 's particularly big .
I <unk> a very simple note on the <unk> to <unk> .
In my <unk> <unk> , there are <unk> <unk> , without <unk> the 10 <unk> <unk> <unk> and 12 <unk> <unk> that you can buy for you a huge number of <unk> in the <unk> <unk> that nobody of the <unk> <unk> <unk> is <unk> of your <unk> .
And that 's what the <unk> is .
Then you go to <unk> <unk> to buy a <unk> : <unk> , <unk> , radio , <unk> , <unk> , radio , <unk> , <unk> .
And in this single <unk> store , there 's a large number of <unk> <unk> .
We can do six million different <unk> using the <unk> that there are in one only store .
<unk> <unk> that there is <unk> choice .
<unk> <unk> : the world of <unk> .
Once , when I was a child , you could get all the services <unk> , <unk> , to <unk> that they were <unk> by <unk> <unk> .
They <unk> the phone , not <unk> .
A <unk> of that , between the other , was that the phone never <unk> .
These days they went .
We 're now a <unk> <unk> <unk> , especially in <unk> .
Here 's cell phones .
My <unk> is in the middle , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , and <unk> for the <unk> <unk> .
If you 're not going to have seen this in the store under the house , you 're very soon <unk> .
And what 's the end of the end of the <unk> and it does this question . And you know what the answer is , " No . "
It 's not possible to buy a cell phone that 's not <unk> <unk> .
So , in other <unk> of life that are much more important than <unk> , <unk> the same <unk> of choices .
<unk> <unk> : It doesn 't happen to the United States that you 're going to <unk> from the <unk> and the <unk> you what you have to do .
Instead , I 'm going to get out of the <unk> , and the <unk> tells you , " OK , we could do . " And he said , " OK , you know , you know , you have these <unk> . What do you want to do ? "
You ask him , " What would you do ? "
And the <unk> says , " <unk> has these <unk> and these <unk> , and <unk> has these <unk> and <unk> . "
" What do ? "
And you say , " <unk> if you were me , what would you say ? "
And the <unk> : I 'm not her . "
We <unk> it to the <unk> <unk> , which makes it look like a beautiful thing .
But actually it 's not a <unk> that <unk> the weight and responsibility for someone who knows something , <unk> the <unk> , to <unk> that they don 't know -- and almost certainly is <unk> -- and not in <unk> <unk> , and then not in <unk> <unk> to make decisions about <unk> .
There 's a huge <unk> of <unk> products , <unk> to people like me and you , that if you think of it has no sense , because we can 't <unk> .
But if we can 't <unk> , why can we <unk> them ?
The answer is they want to <unk> , we call the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> that 's how our <unk> is a <unk> of <unk> , as we see in this <unk> . " We don 't want to <unk> children . <unk> their <unk> at the right time . " We don 't <unk> a <unk> . We 're not going to <unk> .
And we can <unk> how many times we <unk> .
which means that every <unk> , <unk> to <unk> , you have to decide that kind of person you want to be .
<unk> to family and <unk> , a time perspective , a common perspective , <unk> almost to anybody , was that they would be as soon as possible .
The only real choice was with who , not when , and even what to do after .
<unk> , all that 's really <unk> to play .
They 're going to be very smart students , and they <unk> the 20 percent less work than a time .
And not because they 're less <unk> , because they 're less <unk> .
but why are they <unk> , they 're going to <unk> , " <unk> <unk> or not ? "
" <unk> <unk> <unk> ? I 've got to think about before the children or to the career ? "
They 're <unk> <unk> .
And they try to answer these questions , even if this <unk> is not to <unk> the <unk> that we 're going to get it to my <unk> .
And they really have to do that . They 're important questions .
Now , the work : we 're <unk> , as <unk> , because the technology technology <unk> us all day , every day , from every day of the planet , <unk> that from <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , there is a <unk> , and I 'm not going to say anybody , where the <unk> works .
I 'm not saying that , because I want to use it .
What does , this incredible <unk> freedom that we have about this ? It 's that we have to decide , <unk> at any time , if we have to work or not .
We can go to see our son to play <unk> , with the cell phone in a <unk> , the <unk> in the other , and the <unk> , <unk> .
And even if they 're all <unk> , every minute that we see our son , we 're also <unk> , " I have to answer this call ? "
" I have to answer this <unk> ? "
And even when the answer is , " no , that makes the experience of your son very different from what it would be in other conditions .
So , from any of course , you know , little objects and big objects , life is a matter of choices .
Once the world was this : <unk> , there were some chance , but not everything was a choice .
The world today is , " <unk> is , " Is it a <unk> thing , or <unk> ? "
The answer is <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> we all know , so I 'm going to talk about the <unk> .
<unk> this choice <unk> effects two effects effects of people .
The first , <unk> , is that it <unk> instead of <unk> .
With a lot of <unk> between which to choose , it becomes very difficult to do it .
I 'm going to give you an example of <unk> : a <unk> study <unk> <unk> .
A <unk> of my <unk> <unk> data , <unk> society , with about a million <unk> <unk> , with about a million <unk> <unk> in different <unk> .
What she discovered is that for every 10 solutions that are <unk> , the <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> two percent .
<unk> <unk> <unk> , there 's 10 percent <unk> , there 's 10 percent less than when they 're available to only five . Why ?
Because with 50 <unk> <unk> between which to choose , is to be hard to decide , and the choice is <unk> to <unk> .
And in <unk> , and again , <unk> , <unk> , and of course <unk> , and of course it will never get .
<unk> that means not only that these <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> because they 're not enough money , it wants to say that the decision is so <unk> that it also <unk> <unk> <unk> of the work .
They 're not going to be <unk> , they 're <unk> for five <unk> year from the <unk> of work , which would be well well <unk> .
So the <unk> is a <unk> of having <unk> choices .
And I think that <unk> the world like this .
" And to end , to <unk> : <unk> , <unk> or <unk> ? "
I 'm going to be <unk> , if it 's for <unk> , right ?
You don 't want to choose the wrong , and you <unk> the wrong <unk> .
So this is the first effect . The second one is that even if we can <unk> <unk> and make choice , at the end of the <unk> of how we <unk> with less than <unk> between which <unk> .
And that 's why .
One of them is that with a lot of <unk> between which to choose , if you <unk> one and it 's not perfect , it 's easy to imagine that it could make a different choice that would be better . And what happens is that the <unk> <unk> <unk> us to <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> <unk> from the <unk> decision , and the <unk> <unk> <unk> from the <unk> decision ,
And even when it was a <unk> decision .
<unk> choices are , <unk> <unk> than any <unk> that it 's <unk> to be <unk> .
<unk> , there 's what <unk> call <unk> .
<unk> <unk> has <unk> very well as the value that we give things <unk> from what we <unk> .
<unk> rest , when there are a lot of possible , it 's easy to <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> and be less than the <unk> that 's choice .
Here 's an example . I 'm <unk> with all the <unk> that are not in New York .
But that 's what 's probably going to happen .
There 's this <unk> <unk> .
A <unk> place .
<unk> <unk> . <unk> day . It 's all for them .
It 's not going to happen . But what he thinks is , " Well , it 's <unk> . "
" All my <unk> <unk> are <unk> . "
" <unk> <unk> <unk> right in front of the home . "
And it <unk> two weeks from the idea that it 's <unk> -- every day -- the chance of <unk> where it wants .
The <unk> <unk> for what we have , even when choice was <unk> .
And the more of the <unk> we have from <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Here 's another example .
This <unk> tells us a lot of things .
It 's about the moment , and maybe a living slowly .
But the most important thing is that you 're going to , you 're going to <unk> , you 're not going to do others .
The things that they don 't have a lot of <unk> that can make less <unk> what we do .
<unk> <unk> : <unk> <unk> <unk> .
I tried it on my skin <unk> a new couple of <unk> .
We 're almost always <unk> .
Once the <unk> were just one like , <unk> , <unk> , they were <unk> , only after <unk> , they were <unk> , only after <unk> a life and <unk> a lot of times , they were going to go well .
So , I started to <unk> a couple of a new when the <unk> were gone , and I said , " I need a couple of <unk> , this is my <unk> . "
The <unk> told me , " Do you want to <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> ? "
You want to <unk> or <unk> ? " <unk> " or " <unk> " <unk> " ? "
" " <unk> wants to <unk> ? "
" <unk> wants to <unk> or <unk> ? <unk> <unk> <unk> -- " <unk> to <unk> .
I was <unk> , and after a while I was able to say , " I want the guy that was the only guy , " I want the only guy " I had ever <unk> <unk> <unk> , then I <unk> all <unk> <unk> <unk> , then I was the <unk> <unk> <unk> , then I was the <unk> of <unk> , and then I was the <unk> <unk> <unk> , and then I was the <unk> of <unk> <unk> , I had ever .
It was <unk> . With all that choice I had <unk> the best .
But I 'm going to get worse .
Why ? I 've written a whole book to <unk> .
The reason I was worse is that with all that choice was <unk> , the <unk> <unk> to be <unk> .
I had <unk> <unk> . I didn 't <unk> anything about <unk> when I just <unk> just a guy , but when I <unk> 100 different , I would say , at least one of them , you know , at least one kind of had to be perfect .
What I had <unk> was good , but not perfect .
And after I <unk> that <unk> with what I was <unk> in <unk> to <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> in the lives of people don 't make <unk> the <unk> that these <unk> have <unk> to the <unk> of the same .
And this <unk> <unk> , even when the results are good .
<unk> in the world of the <unk> is that it 's .
Because if you 're <unk> , I 'm talking about what I 'm talking .
The <unk> truth is to this .
" And it was better when he was <unk> , " The reason he was better when he was even even even when he was worse , it was still <unk> <unk> .
<unk> , in the world that we live in -- <unk> , <unk> citizens with the <unk> of <unk> -- the <unk> that we can <unk> is that the <unk> <unk> .
You 're not going to be <unk> because your <unk> , my <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> of happiness -- what you 're here -- is , " <unk> <unk> " Yes , you want to do it . "
I mean -- little <unk> moment -- which I 'm really <unk> and my wife is really <unk> .
I couldn 't do better , I didn 't have <unk> .
But <unk> is not always a <unk> thing .
<unk> , a <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> when there is just that kind of <unk> is that when you 're not <unk> , and I 'm going to you , why ? "
" Who is <unk> ? " <unk> , the answer is <unk> .
The world is <unk> . What can I do ?
When you have hundreds of <unk> , and you get a <unk> , and you <unk> a <unk> , and you know who 's the <unk> , it 's clear that the <unk> you are .
I could have better .
With hundreds of <unk> , there are not <unk> for <unk> .
So when people make decisions , even if the result is <unk> , they <unk> and give them their own .
In the last years , the <unk> is <unk> in the <unk> world .
I think a <unk> <unk> -- not the only , but important -- this <unk> <unk> of <unk> is just that people have <unk> experiences because the standard are too <unk> .
And when they have to <unk> this situation they think that they 're <unk> is .
So the final result is that we 're better , <unk> , but we 'll get worse .
Let me tell you .
This is <unk> <unk> , what we all take for good and it 's completely <unk> . It 's not true .
There is no <unk> that a little bit of choice is better than to <unk> that a little bit better than that a little bit is better than a little bit .
There 's a <unk> value , <unk> . I don 't know what it is .
But I 'm quite sure we 've <unk> from a piece of the level where the choices <unk> our lives .
Now , from a <unk> <unk> -- I almost almost finished -- from a <unk> <unk> , the <unk> is the <unk> .
What it allows all this choice in the <unk> society is the <unk> material .
There are a lot of places in the world , and you know , where the problem is not that they have <unk> choice .
The problem is they have too <unk> .
So the <unk> that I 'm talking about is a <unk> <unk> of <unk> , <unk> society .
And what <unk> does <unk> and <unk> is this : <unk> <unk> <unk> talked about yesterday about how the <unk> and <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> are <unk> . It 's a <unk> of money .
I mean that these choices , <unk> and <unk> , is not that they 're just <unk> .
They 're <unk> <unk> .
They 're worse .
If a while of what we do is , in our society it <unk> to be <unk> in those where people have too few <unk> , it would not only be their lives to <unk> and our own .
This is what <unk> call a <unk> <unk> .
A <unk> of income does well , not only to the poor -- because of this choice in <unk> that we <unk> .
To end , " <unk> , you can get all the you want to --
<unk> , people of culture , they said , " But what 's the fish do that ? "
" It 's <unk> that you can 't do anything in a glass <unk> . "
" A <unk> imagination , a <unk> view of the world --
and <unk> I <unk> it like this , in the beginning .
But then , <unk> , instead , I realized that that that fish knows the long .
Because the reality of <unk> is that if you <unk> the <unk> , in a way that " everything is possible , " you can 't <unk> the <unk> . You <unk> the <unk> .
If you <unk> the <unk> in a way that it could <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Everybody needs a <unk> .
This is almost certainly too <unk> , maybe even for the fish , and certainly certainly for the fish , and certainly for us .
But the <unk> of some <unk> <unk> is a <unk> <unk> and , <unk> , for <unk> .
Thank you very much .
