<unk> year I showed these <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , which for almost three million years has had the size of three million years has had the size of the United States <unk> , <unk> 40 percent .
So , this <unk> <unk> of the problem because it doesn 't show the ice <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> is , in a certain sense , the heart <unk> of global warming .
It 's <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The next <unk> will be a <unk> <unk> on the <unk> of the last 25 years .
<unk> <unk> are <unk> in red .
You see , you 're <unk> down to the blue <unk> .
That 's the ice in <unk> , which <unk> <unk> in summer .
You can see that the <unk> ice <unk> , five years or more , is like the blood , which here is <unk> by the body .
25 years is <unk> past .
This is a problem because the <unk> are <unk> <unk> around the ocean <unk> where there are huge <unk> of <unk> that , <unk> , <unk> are <unk> <unk> by <unk> .
<unk> to the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> , that <unk> <unk> could <unk> , that <unk> <unk> <unk> .
In some <unk> , <unk> <unk> , the <unk> is already <unk> by water .
The <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> ! Al <unk> : She 's good . <unk> : She 's going to be if we <unk> .
A reason is that this <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> from the north .
This is a river in <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> had never <unk> <unk> <unk> .
This is the <unk> river , in the <unk> of <unk> .
If you want to know how the <unk> <unk> <unk> on <unk> , and it 's where the sea .
These <unk> are <unk> <unk> <unk> .
On the other part of the planet : <unk> , the greatest <unk> ice on the planet .
<unk> last month , scientists have <unk> that the ice <unk> is in <unk> , and that <unk> <unk> on some <unk> <unk> , is particularly <unk> in <unk> .
<unk> at six feet of level of <unk> , like <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , the <unk> third <unk> of ice , you see new <unk> , which a few years ago , they were <unk> .
40 percent of the world 's population <unk> water from that <unk> .
<unk> <unk> : This <unk> is the source of <unk> water <unk> of this city .
<unk> is <unk> .
But when you <unk> , the same happens to <unk> water .
In California , <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> is 40 percent .
<unk> <unk> are <unk> in the crisis .
<unk> , as you read , they 're <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> in the world leads to a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> are <unk> to a <unk> out of normal and <unk> .
<unk> times over the last 30 years of <unk> <unk> .
This is a <unk> of everything .
If you look in the <unk> context , if you can see the <unk> .
In the last five years we have <unk> 70 million <unk> of CO2 every day .
Look at the <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and on both parts of <unk> <unk> , where there is a <unk> <unk> of oxygen in the ocean .
The <unk> of global warming , together to <unk> , which is 20 percent , is the use of <unk> <unk> .
<unk> is a problem , and <unk> is even worse .
The United States is one of the <unk> with <unk> emissions , together to China .
And it 's <unk> to build a lot of other <unk> <unk> .
But we 're <unk> to a <unk> of <unk> .
These are the <unk> projects in the last years and some <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
<unk> , there is a <unk> politics in our country .
<unk> <unk> and oil <unk> have <unk> million dollars in the last year to <unk> <unk> <unk> , which is a <unk> .
I 'm going to <unk> something --
<unk> <unk> , in <unk> , where I live , there was a <unk> <unk> billion <unk> of <unk> .
You may have seen it on <unk> .
This is the second largest flow of <unk> in America .
It 's happened around <unk> .
<unk> <unk> of one of <unk> <unk> was this .
<unk> : <unk> ♫ ♫ <unk> the <unk> is a <unk> and happy .
It 's <unk> here in America , and it 's going to be <unk> in America , and it 's <unk> our economy .
<unk> <unk> is <unk> <unk> .
It 's <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Al <unk> : <unk> is <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The greatest <unk> society on the <unk> is <unk> <unk> . This is his <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> <unk> -- <unk> <unk> -- Al <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> -- they don 't know what they 're talking about .
Al <unk> : So the <unk> for <unk> 's <unk> <unk> has two <unk> .
This is one of them , one part .
<unk> : <unk> : <unk> <unk> , we see the <unk> changes as a <unk> <unk> to our business .
So our <unk> is <unk> a big amount of money in a <unk> <unk> to make public public and <unk> the truth on <unk> .
In fact , <unk> is not <unk> .
We think it 's <unk> -- it 's also a good <unk> .
So , it doesn 't change climate change .
We 're going to be doing .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> <unk> -- you 've heard about it very much .
So we <unk> a <unk> in a <unk> structure , for how <unk> <unk> is <unk> .
<unk> ! <unk> are a little bit <unk> , but this is the sound of <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> is between the major <unk> of global warming , but <unk> technology technology <unk> that you see .
So , let 's look at this . This is the <unk> technology .
Al <unk> : <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to the economic issue and the national security .
<unk> : <unk> : America is in the crisis ; the national security , the national security ,
The <unk> that <unk> all : our <unk> from <unk> <unk> <unk> , like <unk> <unk> and oil .
Now , there 's a new <unk> , <unk> solution to <unk> .
<unk> America : 100 percent of <unk> energy , in 10 years .
A plan for <unk> America to work , <unk> <unk> , and help <unk> the global warming .
<unk> , a solution that we can solve our problems .
<unk> America . <unk> more .
Al <unk> : This is the last one .
<unk> : <unk> : It 's about <unk> energy to America .
One of the most <unk> ways to <unk> <unk> from <unk> that <unk> our planet .
<unk> : The future is here . <unk> , <unk> , a new network <unk> .
<unk> <unk> 2 : <unk> <unk> <unk> for jobs that <unk> <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> America . It 's time to be <unk> .
Al <unk> : A old <unk> <unk> says , " If you want to go <unk> , go alone .
If you want to go away , you go . "
We need to go away , quickly .
Thank you very much .
<unk> year at TED I did a <unk> on <unk> .
And I 'm going to try to <unk> how the machine works .
So , here we go . And for those that the other time there were no , <unk> is the largest scientific experiment ever <unk> -- <unk> miles of <unk> .
His task is to <unk> the conditions that were in the <unk> of the universe -- until <unk> million times a second from the beginning of the universe -- until <unk> million times a second .
All of that is just <unk> .
This is the machine under <unk> .
We <unk> these <unk> <unk> inside the <unk> .
This is what I work . It 's called <unk> -- <unk> <unk> feet and has a <unk> <unk> .
This is a <unk> picture of <unk> in <unk> , so you can see the <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> last year we <unk> the machine for the first time .
And this picture was <unk> by <unk> .
It was because of <unk> <unk> <unk> in control .
It 's an image of the first <unk> of particles that had done all around <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , with a part of the <unk> , and we look at the <unk> .
In other words , when you <unk> the picture the <unk> , you <unk> that the machine , which is a big <unk> .
I don 't know if it was this to make us more or this , when someone <unk> on Google and <unk> that the page was this .
That means that we have had a <unk> impact beyond that scientific .
<unk> a week later , there was a problem with the machine , because there was -- these <unk> <unk> .
These <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> when the machine works at the <unk> of <unk> .
Now , the <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> , " It 's not true . It 's not true . It 's too <unk> . "
And they can do it because when they 're very <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
So , at least <unk> degrees <unk> , at a temperature <unk> at that of the space between stars , these <unk> can bring that <unk> .
In one of the <unk> between the <unk> of <unk> <unk> in <unk> , there was a <unk> <unk> .
So the <unk> <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a electric <unk> .
This was the result .
Now this is even <unk> if you think that these <unk> <unk> <unk> more than 20 <unk> , and that 's <unk> about 30 <unk> .
They <unk> about 50 <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , what we did .
We <unk> them and <unk> .
They 're going to be <unk> all to their <unk> place .
<unk> the end of <unk> the <unk> will be again .
We <unk> it , and we <unk> to get <unk> data to <unk> or <unk> , and that our <unk> to find out what the <unk> are the <unk> that <unk> the universe .
Now , of course , in a certain way , these <unk> <unk> <unk> the value of science and engineering engineering . It 's easy to <unk> .
I think that the fact that it 's so difficult , the fact that it 's the value of things like <unk> .
I want to end with the words of a <unk> <unk> , which , <unk> <unk> , which , <unk> , in <unk> of <unk> experiments of his <unk> , his <unk> was Michael <unk> , said , " No <unk> <unk> <unk> for the progress of human mind as the ideas of the human mind as the ideas of science is <unk> , that there are not <unk> , that there are no new <unk> , and there are no new <unk> . "
Thank you .
I want to start <unk> to <unk> to <unk> to <unk> .
As we <unk> as <unk> and <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> ,
<unk> <unk> is <unk> <unk> to the way that we <unk> part of the world around us .
So , from <unk> <unk> from <unk> <unk> of our <unk> with <unk> objects , and my <unk> <unk> <unk> , and I started <unk> , " And if we use a computer , instead of having the <unk> <unk> as a computer , instead of having the <unk> <unk> as a digital <unk> that moves on a <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of information with both hands ,
and <unk> to our <unk> ?
The question was so interesting that we could <unk> to explore the answer , building <unk> .
In a few words , a <unk> is a <unk> computer as a <unk> .
In a few words , a <unk> is a <unk> computer as a <unk> .
You can <unk> them with your hand , they can be <unk> <unk> , and feel their <unk> movement and have a <unk> radio .
But <unk> , they 're <unk> objects , like <unk> , you can just <unk> <unk> .
<unk> are the example of a new <unk> of tools to <unk> information .
And as they become <unk> , <unk> <unk> of the <unk> movement , others , and other , and as they become <unk> , <unk> <unk> of their <unk> movement , others , how we can <unk> them , and <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Let me start with some simple example .
This <unk> is <unk> to show you about video : if you <unk> it in a direction , video <unk> , so if you <unk> on the other side , you can see it , you can see it in a direction , you can see it in a direction , the <unk> on the other side , you can see it in a direction , the <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , and you can 't see it in a direction , the <unk> ,
These <unk> <unk> are <unk> of others .
If you <unk> them , you 're <unk> to what they 're around .
If they 're <unk> , they can <unk> it a little bit .
If they 're <unk> , they can <unk> it a little bit .
They also <unk> their movement and <unk> .
We then realized that one of the interesting <unk> of the <unk> was the <unk> to use is that they could use common on data , for example , <unk> <unk> .
In this case , we have three <unk> <unk> <unk> as a <unk> <unk> and I can <unk> it to <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> , where you 're <unk> .
And I can <unk> to <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> , where you 're <unk> .
If we <unk> too much , we can <unk> a little bit of a place .
I 'm also <unk> to <unk> , like <unk> , mathematics and games where people can try to <unk> things things that quickly , and <unk> the results immediately .
Now I 'm --
This is a sequence of <unk> I do with a <unk> program .
Here we have a <unk> game in <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> , every <unk> <unk> a letter on every <unk> , <unk> , every <unk> , <unk> , every <unk> <unk> , and then <unk> <unk> a letter on every <unk> , and while I was <unk> <unk> , he <unk> on a <unk> .
Then , after about 30 seconds , and you <unk> , and you have a new <unk> of <unk> and new <unk> to try .
Thank you .
Here are <unk> children <unk> in <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> , I made them so I <unk> them and I <unk> a video .
They 're very <unk> .
And one of the interesting things about this kind of <unk> is that you don 't have to give people a lot of <unk> .
I just mean , " <unk> <unk> of words , " and they know exactly what to do .
Here 's other people who <unk> it .
This is our <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and there 's a little bit more there .
It actually wanted to <unk> .
They were just <unk> , for him .
Now this is a <unk> <unk> of a <unk> <unk> .
He had to build a tool for the <unk> of <unk> . He 's <unk> .
It can <unk> new characters in the scene , <unk> the <unk> their <unk> .
It can <unk> new characters in the scene , <unk> the <unk> their <unk> .
Here is , it 's doing the sun .
<unk> : The sun is <unk> .
David <unk> : Now he brought a <unk> in the scene .
<unk> : The <unk> <unk> .
<unk> work ! <unk> ! <unk> .
So , <unk> <unk> can <unk> <unk> <unk> can <unk> the characters --
<unk> : <unk> !
-- I <unk> their story .
<unk> : <unk> !
<unk> : It 's a story with the open , and it can decide how it <unk> it .
<unk> : It 's a story with the open , and it can decide how it <unk> it .
<unk> : <unk> away , <unk> .
<unk> : The last example I have time to show you is a tool that I did is a tool that I recently was <unk> , to <unk> and <unk> music .
is a <unk> , <unk> recently , for <unk> and <unk> music .
The <unk> here are <unk> <unk> as the <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
<unk> of these have four different <unk> , and you can choose what to use .
You can also <unk> these <unk> in a sequence from <unk> to your <unk> .
And I just <unk> by doing a " sound " and a <unk> sequence . "
These are effects that you can be alive , like <unk> and <unk> .
It 's going to be a particular sound and then <unk> to <unk> .
And then there are the effects of time and <unk> , which <unk> to <unk> the whole sequence .
It 's <unk> like this works .
<unk> : <unk> : <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> , " <unk> in a series , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
Now you 're going to take a little line .
<unk> : <unk> : <unk> . Now , <unk> <unk> <unk> --
<unk> : <unk> : And now I 'm going to <unk> the <unk> , so I can control the effect of alive .
<unk> : <unk> : I can <unk> the whole sequence of time , or on the side ,
<unk> : <unk> : And now we 're going to <unk> the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> : I can <unk> the sequence " flight " to flight . "
So I don 't have to <unk> before , but I can <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
And now , finally , I can <unk> the whole sequence of <unk> <unk> on the left the <unk> .
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is to build new <unk> <unk> and more <unk> to how our brain work and body .
And today , I 've had time to show you one of the results of this path , and also a few <unk> that we 're trying to get out of the lab .
The concept I want to <unk> is that it 's going to <unk> this new generation of objects to <unk> the <unk> media , which <unk> information in our world in the way we want .
Thank you very much .
I don 't see the time to talk to all of you .
I 'm a <unk> .
<unk> books is my <unk> but is more than this , of course .
It 's also the love and <unk> of my life .
And I don 't like that I can change .
But , I said this , something particular happened happened in my life and in my career , who <unk> me to <unk> the whole relationship with this work .
The particular thing is I <unk> wrote this book , this <unk> called <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> .
And the result is that everywhere I 'm going to be <unk> , people like I was <unk> .
<unk> -- <unk> , <unk> !
I 'm going to <unk> all the <unk> and they say , " You 're not afraid of you can not be able to do better ?
You don 't fear to keep writing for all life without able to create a book that can make a book that can <unk> to somebody ? "
<unk> that can <unk> ? "
It 's <unk> , you know .
But it could go worse , and I remember that over 20 years ago , when I was to say to people -- a <unk> -- I wanted to be a <unk> .
I 'm going to <unk> the same <unk> <unk> by fear .
And people said , " Don 't you know , you don 't know that to be successful ?
You don 't fear that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> ?
You don 't fear to do this <unk> for all life without anything from it , and to die on a <unk> of dreams with the <unk> <unk> 's mouth with the <unk> <unk> 's mouth ? "
So , you know .
The answer -- the short answer to all these questions is , " Yeah . "
Yeah , I fear of all those things .
I 've always had fear .
And I 'm afraid of many other things that people don 't have <unk> .
It 's like <unk> and other things <unk> .
But , as I thought , and I thought , and I thought , is why ?
Is it <unk> ?
It 's <unk> that anyone who <unk> <unk> to be <unk> by a job that you feel born for me .
But what is so particular in <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> in a way that other <unk> do not ?
Like my father , for example , he was a <unk> <unk> and I didn 't remember one time in his 40 years of activity where he was asked if she was <unk> to be <unk> <unk> ?
It had never -- that <unk> <unk> <unk> John , how do you go ?
<unk> 't you so , <unk> ?
<unk> , the engineers <unk> as a group of certainly , in <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
We <unk> , we have enough this <unk> , and not only <unk> but <unk> of all that , we have this <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And we 're not going to be able to look at the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> that , only in the <unk> century , <unk> young and often to them .
And those who don 't <unk> seem to be really <unk> by their <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , before I died , in the last <unk> said , " Every book , he <unk> me a little bit more , " A little bit more extraordinary <unk> about the work of his life .
But we don 't know when we say , because we heard these things so long that somehow we have <unk> and <unk> the <unk> that creativity and <unk> the <unk> that creativity and <unk> are in some <unk> way , and that art , at the end , I always <unk> to <unk> .
And the question I want to <unk> all over here is , are you <unk> with this idea ?
It 's OK , you know , because it 's a <unk> distance to me to me .
I think it 's <unk> .
And I think it 's also <unk> , and I don 't want to <unk> <unk> in the next century .
I think it 's better <unk> our great <unk> to live .
And certainly I know that , in my case -- it would be very <unk> to start <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in which I 'm in my career .
<unk> -- look at , I 'm pretty young , I have about 40 years .
I still have about four <unk> of work in me .
And it 's very <unk> that anything you 're going to happen to be <unk> from the world as the work that <unk> after the <unk> of my last book .
<unk> <unk> , because we 're all about <unk> , because we 're all <unk> <unk> to be <unk> .
Oh , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> !
You know this is the kind of <unk> that brings a person to <unk> <unk> to nine of the nine of the morning and I don 't want to do it .
I 'm going to continue to do this work that I love .
So , the question becomes , how ?
And so it seems to me , after many <unk> , that the way to work to continue to write is to create a <unk> <unk> <unk> , OK ?
I have to have to get a distance of security between me , which I 'm <unk> , and my natural <unk> on which is <unk> <unk> . And while I was going to get it , and I 'm going to <unk> the whole year we could look through time , looking for finding other society to see if we 're going to have to have better ideas and more <unk> ideas and <unk> .
about how to help people <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of creativity .
And that research took me to <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
It 's because they 're going to go back and then <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> -- people don 't know that <unk> creativity from men , OK ?
It <unk> that creativity was this <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> to men from some <unk> <unk> and <unk> , for reasons and <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> these <unk> <unk> of creativity " <unk> <unk> . "
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> to have a <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> from a <unk> .
<unk> were the same idea , but <unk> that <unk> species of <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> is <unk> , because <unk> <unk> didn 't really <unk> that a <unk> was somebody particularly intelligent .
And I thought that a <unk> was this kind of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , literally in the <unk> of the <unk> , and that <unk> out of <unk> <unk> , and that <unk> out of <unk> <unk> the work of the artist artist and <unk> to <unk> the work of the artist and <unk> the result of that work .
<unk> <unk> <unk> , that 's the distance of what I talk -- that <unk> <unk> <unk> you from the results of your work .
And all <unk> that was that you were so <unk> , right ?
So , the <unk> artists were <unk> by <unk> things , like <unk> <unk> , right ?
If your work was <unk> not <unk> to <unk> the <unk> , everybody <unk> that <unk> state of this <unk> <unk> .
If your work <unk> , it wasn 't all your <unk> , right ?
Everybody <unk> that was your <unk> to be a <unk> .
And so the people <unk> <unk> creativity in <unk> for a long time .
Then the <unk> <unk> and everything , and we <unk> this great idea ; we put the human in the center of the universe , on all the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and
This was the principle of <unk> <unk> and people <unk> to think that creativity <unk> completely from <unk> .
And for the first time in history , <unk> to <unk> to this or that artist as a <unk> <unk> that to a person with <unk> .
And I have to <unk> , I think it was a big <unk> .
I think you 're going to be like a <unk> person to believe that they 're like a <unk> like the source , <unk> and <unk> of all the <unk> <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , <unk> and <unk> is a <unk> responsibility to <unk> .
It 's like <unk> to somebody from <unk> the sun .
<unk> and <unk> completely <unk> the <unk> and creates all these <unk> <unk> <unk> on the <unk> .
And I think it was this pressure to <unk> artists in <unk> 500 years .
And , if this is true , and I think it 's , the question becomes , and now ?
Can we be <unk> ?
<unk> back to a <unk> understanding of the relationship between humans and <unk> <unk> .
Or maybe not .
Maybe we can 't <unk> 500 years of thinking in a 18 minutes .
And there 's probably people in the audience who <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> on <unk> , <unk> , you do <unk> people <unk> <unk> <unk> to <unk> on their projects .
You probably don 't know all about this thing .
But the question I 'd like to <unk> is -- why don 't I ?
Why don 't you <unk> this way ?
Because it has more sense of anything else I 've ever heard about the <unk> <unk> of <unk> process .
A process that , as anyone who ever <unk> to do something -- so , basically , all of it -- you know , you don 't <unk> <unk> .
And in fact , it can be completely <unk> .
I did this <unk> <unk> with the extraordinary <unk> <unk> , who has now 90 years , but that was a <unk> <unk> for life and said that during his <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> out in the <unk> <unk> , <unk> out in the <unk> <unk> , <unk> out in the <unk> <unk> , <unk> out in the <unk> .
She said to me that was like a <unk> <unk> of air .
And that <unk> <unk> to her from <unk> .
And he <unk> it , because he <unk> the land under his feet .
I 'm going to try to have one thing to do at that point and was , words , " <unk> as a <unk> . "
And so he was <unk> to home and it was <unk> by this <unk> , and it wouldn 't have to do anything else that take a piece of paper and a <unk> enough <unk> , and <unk> on the page .
Sometimes I couldn 't get enough enough fast , so <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> without able to get to home and <unk> it and she would <unk> it and she would <unk> it and she would <unk> it to <unk> through the <unk> , looking for , as she said , " another <unk> . "
Then there were those times -- this piece never <unk> it -- there were times when the time the was almost <unk> , OK ?
So , he was <unk> home and he was looking for paper and the <unk> <unk> through , and he <unk> a <unk> <unk> in the while he was <unk> , and then he was like <unk> , and then said , " How if you <unk> with the other hand and <unk> .
It <unk> the tail and the <unk> in his body and the <unk> on the page .
And in these cases , the <unk> would be <unk> on the <unk> page and <unk> but <unk> , the <unk> <unk> to the <unk> .
So when you <unk> <unk> -- it 's <unk> , it 's exactly <unk> to my <unk> process .
Not all my <unk> process -- I 'm not a <unk> !
I 'm a <unk> , and my <unk> way of <unk> is , <unk> to the same <unk> every day and work and work and <unk> on <unk> .
But even me , in my <unk> , I <unk> against that thing , sometimes .
And I 'm sure that many of you <unk> it .
You know , even if the work and the ideas <unk> me <unk> , I could <unk> <unk> .
And what is this thing ?
And how can we <unk> it in a way that we can 't <unk> your head , but , rather , what <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> ?
For the best <unk> I have been <unk> <unk> <unk> , which I have been <unk> <unk> <unk> , which I have different years ago for a <unk> .
I 'm talking about this , and you know , <unk> , for the <unk> of life was the <unk> artist 's been the <unk> artist <unk> , trying to control <unk> , <unk> these <unk> species of totally <unk> totally <unk> .
But then <unk> , he <unk> up , and one day while he was <unk> on a <unk> <unk> , <unk> everything for him .
I 'm going fast and everything is a <unk> <unk> this little <unk> of <unk> , which comes in his head as <unk> does <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , and you know , and the <unk> , you know , it 's wonderful , and the <unk> , but it doesn 't know how to <unk> .
It 's not a piece of paper , it doesn 't have a <unk> , it doesn 't have a <unk> .
So he starts to hear this kind of old <unk> to grow in him , " I 'm going to lose , and <unk> <unk> <unk> by this <unk> song .
I 'm not enough <unk> , and I can 't <unk> . "
And instead of going to <unk> , they <unk> .
<unk> the whole process and made something completely new .
I just <unk> the sky and said , " <unk> , you know , you can see I 'm going to be ? "
" It seems to you can write a song now ? "
If you really want to <unk> , you 're going to be <unk> when I can <unk> care about you .
<unk> , <unk> to <unk> more <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . "
And his process <unk> <unk> after this .
Not the work , the work was still <unk> as always .
But the process , and the <unk> <unk> that <unk> was <unk> when he <unk> the <unk> , the <unk> that outside him , the <unk> that he was out of <unk> , and he had to not to be a <unk> thing .
but I <unk> this <unk> , wonderful <unk> <unk> a conversation between <unk> and this <unk> thing , and <unk> , but it wasn 't <unk> .
So , how <unk> that story <unk> to change a little bit , the way I <unk> and already <unk> me once .
This idea , I was <unk> when I was <unk> , " <unk> , <unk> , " and I 'm going to <unk> , " and I 'm working on something and we don 't start to think that 's going to be a <unk> , that 's going to be the <unk> book .
Not only <unk> , just <unk> book .
And we started thinking about <unk> this project .
But then I 'm going to <unk> that <unk> to air and <unk> us .
So I <unk> my face on the <unk> and <unk> my <unk> to a <unk> <unk> of the room .
And I said at high <unk> , " <unk> , what , both we know that if this book is not going to be <unk> my , right ?
Because as you see I 'm <unk> everything I have , I have no more than that .
So if you want it to be better , you 've got to <unk> and do your part .
OK . But if you don 't do that , you know what , I 'm not going to be anything .
I started writing the same because it 's my work .
And I would like you to be <unk> that I 've been <unk> to do my part of my <unk> . " Because , that 's so , OK -- <unk> does it , <unk> <unk> does it <unk> in the <unk> of Africa <unk> the <unk> <unk> , <unk> music <unk> , <unk> , music <unk> , music <unk> hours to <unk> .
And they were always <unk> , because the <unk> were <unk> and they were <unk> .
But every <unk> , <unk> , something <unk> , and one of these <unk> artists actually <unk> .
And I know you know what I talk , because I know you 've all seen it , at a certain point , a <unk> like this .
It was like if time <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> through a kind of <unk> and it wasn 't doing anything different from <unk> , like <unk> <unk> <unk> before , but everything was <unk> .
And all of a sudden , you know , you know , you know ,
But it <unk> from <unk> and <unk> in the <unk> fire .
And when this <unk> , at the time , people <unk> what was , he <unk> it with his name .
<unk> your hands and <unk> to <unk> , " <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , God . "
That 's God , you know .
You know , you know , when the <unk> <unk> the <unk> , <unk> this <unk> with them and <unk> <unk> in <unk> by " <unk> , <unk> , " <unk> <unk> , " <unk> , <unk> , " <unk> , " <unk> , <unk> , " which you can still hear in the <unk> or <unk> .
In <unk> , when a artist has done something impossible and <unk> , " <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , " <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , " <unk> , <unk> -- a <unk> of God .
And it 's <unk> because we need .
But , the problem comes after , for the <unk> itself , when you <unk> and <unk> that are 11 of <unk> and <unk> <unk> , and <unk> of God .
It 's just a <unk> <unk> <unk> , and maybe never <unk> to <unk> , and maybe never <unk> to that <unk> .
And maybe nobody <unk> the name of God still while <unk> , and what has to do with the rest of his life ?
It 's hard .
This is one of the most <unk> <unk> to do in a <unk> life .
But maybe it doesn 't have to be so <unk> if you 're <unk> to <unk> , <unk> , that the most <unk> of your being being being being being being being <unk> by you .
But let me just show you that are <unk> <unk> from a source of this <unk> part of your life you 've got to <unk> .
And , you know , if we think it 's all the way .
And so I started to <unk> , and it 's certainly like I <unk> it for several months during the <unk> of the book that I was going to <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> ,
And what I have to continue to <unk> when I feel <unk> from this is , I don 't fear .
You 're not going to be <unk> your work .
<unk> to <unk> for your part , any can be .
If your work is <unk> , <unk> .
If the <unk> , you 're going to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> some kind of <unk> , for just a <unk> through your <unk> , then you know ! "
<unk> , you do the same your <unk> .
And " <unk> ! " <unk> ! " You 're the same .
I think and I think it 's <unk> <unk> .
" <unk> ! " <unk> ! " <unk> , " even for having <unk> love and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Thank you .
Thank you .
<unk> <unk> : <unk> !
As you know I 've already talked about some of these projects on human genome , what can <unk> and <unk> about new genes .
We 're going to be <unk> a new way . We started <unk> biology and now starting from that digital code , we are <unk> in a new <unk> of biology , <unk> and <unk> life .
We 've always tried to ask great questions .
" <unk> is life ? " It 's something that many <unk> , I think they 're <unk> to understand at various levels .
We tried different <unk> , <unk> to <unk> terms .
We 're <unk> for almost 20 years .
When we <unk> the human genome <unk> to go from the <unk> world of biology in the digital world .
Now we <unk> : can we <unk> the life , or create new life from this digital universe ?
This is the map of a little <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , which is the species from the <unk> genome between what can <unk> them in the lab .
And we tried to reduce <unk> the genome to <unk> one even smaller .
We 're able to <unk> a genes of about 500 than 500 than 500 than 500 than 500 than 500 than 500 than 500 than 500 than 500 than 500 than 500 than 500 than 500 than 500 than 500 than 500 than 500 than 500 than 500 than 500 than 500 than 500 than 500 than 500
But when we take a look at her <unk> map , it 's <unk> simple than our own .
<unk> , this is simple .
But when we look at all the genes that we can <unk> , one at time , is very <unk> that this can bring a <unk> cell cell .
So I thought the only way to <unk> was <unk> this <unk> so that we could <unk> <unk> <unk> some of these <unk> questions .
So we started the <unk> of " Can we be a <unk> ? "
Can the chemistry <unk> to produce these big molecules that we never <unk> to create these <unk> before ?
And , in case , can we make a <unk> ?
A <unk> is just a piece of <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The speed we 're able to <unk> life is <unk> to <unk> <unk> .
Our ability to write the code , instead of <unk> <unk> , but it 's <unk> .
And our <unk> results are <unk> to <unk> <unk> .
We 've been <unk> over 15 years ago .
The process has <unk> a lot of <unk> , <unk> with a <unk> <unk> before we <unk> the early experiments .
But we found that DNA <unk> is very difficult .
There are <unk> of thousands of cars in the world that <unk> small <unk> , <unk> of 30 to 50 <unk> and it 's a <unk> process : the <unk> is a <unk> process : the <unk> is <unk> along , <unk> .
So we had to develop a new <unk> to <unk> these <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
And this was our first <unk> , starting from digital information of <unk> <unk> <unk> .
It 's a little virus that bacteria <unk> .
We designed <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> a DNA of DNA <unk> , and <unk> a DNA of about <unk> <unk> .
The interesting part is when we took this piece of <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> it in bacteria , bacteria have <unk> to read this code and <unk> particles .
The <unk> particles have been <unk> by cells , and they <unk> back and <unk> <unk> <unk> .
I talked about recently with members of the <unk> <unk> industry that they were <unk> this model .
They have more <unk> than you .
<unk> that this is a situation where the software can actually build its same <unk> in a <unk> system .
But we can do things in the <unk> .
It 's going to build the whole <unk> of <unk> .
I 'm more than <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
So we thought we 're going to <unk> in <unk> <unk> , so that we can change <unk> to understand what the <unk> of a <unk> cell .
<unk> is <unk> , and if you <unk> information information <unk> in a computer , these must be very <unk> .
When we <unk> this genome in the first time , the standard <unk> was a <unk> for every 10 <unk> <unk> .
We found , <unk> , 30 <unk> . If we used that original sequence never <unk> that could be able to do it .
One part of the process is to design <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> with all the other <unk> of 50 <unk> to build smaller <unk> <unk> .
It 's going to be <unk> here .
You probably read that you read about <unk> .
<unk> <unk> : We have a <unk> code on four <unk> : A , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> of those <unk> <unk> together together <unk> about 20 <unk> , and there 's a <unk> order of <unk> .
So we can use the code to write words , <unk> , <unk> .
What we did at the beginning was <unk> .
Some have been <unk> by the fact that it wasn 't <unk> .
We designed these <unk> to <unk> just <unk> with <unk> .
There are <unk> that <unk> them and <unk> <unk> them .
And we started <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
But every step we made , these <unk> <unk> in <unk> so that we 're <unk> , because we 're <unk> to create a very <unk> <unk> <unk> as you 're going to see in a minute .
We 're trying to <unk> the process .
So this seems to be the <unk> of a <unk> <unk> .
When you go to these <unk> <unk> <unk> , more than 100 <unk> <unk> , you 're not going to be <unk> directly in <unk> .
You get to the <unk> of <unk> biology .
So we have <unk> other <unk> .
<unk> of another <unk> called <unk> <unk> , which in biology <unk> to <unk> the DNA that can <unk> <unk> the <unk> .
Here 's one example .
This <unk> , called <unk> <unk> , can <unk> three million <unk> of <unk> .
You can see in the <unk> <unk> as his <unk> is <unk> .
<unk> -- 24 hours is <unk> exactly like it was before .
<unk> thousands of organisms that can do that .
These organisms can be completely <unk> .
It 's going to be living under <unk> .
I 'm absolutely sure that life <unk> in space , and <unk> <unk> of water .
In fact , NASA showed that this is going on .
This is a picture of the <unk> that we built these <unk> , just using these <unk> <unk> with design <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> <unk> .
This picture was not <unk> with a <unk> <unk> , but with a <unk> <unk> .
It 's a <unk> so big that we can <unk> with a <unk> <unk> .
These are pictures that <unk> a period of about six seconds .
This is the <unk> we 've done a little bit of time ago .
I 'm more than <unk> <unk> <unk> code .
It 's the greatest <unk> of a <unk> <unk> ever <unk> by man .
It 's got <unk> <unk> <unk> to 300 million .
If you <unk> it with a <unk> 10 without spaces , we would take pages to <unk> this code .
Now , how do we do it ? How do we <unk> ?
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> is a <unk> game .
It 's a little bit more <unk> when you use of bacteria .
It 's even even when it 's about <unk> cells as our <unk> . You can just <unk> the <unk> and <unk> another , which is that basically the <unk> process .
In <unk> , <unk> , the <unk> is <unk> in the cell , but we have <unk> <unk> that we are able to make a <unk> <unk> of a cell <unk> to another cell <unk> .
We <unk> a <unk> <unk> from a species .
The two are different than men are <unk> .
We <unk> some <unk> <unk> in a way that we could decide what to do for this <unk> .
And he then <unk> with <unk> <unk> <unk> all the <unk> .
And when we put it in the cell was <unk> and <unk> our <unk> <unk> , and we <unk> our <unk> <unk> the new <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And <unk> <unk> that we don 't want to go beyond , but we <unk> it up .
This is one of the major <unk> of evolution .
We found that <unk> species have <unk> a second or a third <unk> from some part , <unk> in a second thousands of new <unk> to that species .
So who think about the evolution as a only <unk> at the time you <unk> doesn 't understand a lot of biology .
We 're going to be <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> the DNA .
The <unk> that was in the cell didn 't know one .
The <unk> <unk> we have <unk> <unk> .
It 's <unk> , and it <unk> the other <unk> as <unk> , and <unk> the other <unk> , and we <unk> with only the cell and the new <unk> .
It became blue because of the genes that we <unk> .
And in a short <unk> of time , all the <unk> of a species are <unk> , and it 's <unk> all in a new species , <unk> on the new software that we <unk> in the cell .
All the <unk> are <unk> , <unk> are <unk> , and when you <unk> the code <unk> exactly to what we have <unk> .
Now this could be <unk> <unk> , but we can <unk> the software DNA , we can change things in a <unk> <unk> .
Now , I 've already <unk> that 's not about <unk> -- but <unk> <unk> to start three million years and a half of evolution , and I 've already been <unk> that maybe we 're going to create a new version of <unk> <unk> <unk> in which we 're going to be <unk> new species <unk> on this <unk> process .
Why do that ?
I think it 's pretty <unk> enough when we think about our <unk> .
We 're going to be <unk> by six and a half billion people in <unk> billion in the next 40 years .
<unk> <unk> : I was born in <unk> .
Now there are three people on the planet to <unk> <unk> in <unk> ; in 40 years , there 's four .
We 're <unk> problems now to find food , water <unk> and <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , <unk> and <unk> for six billion people .
We 're going to get to do that for nine billion .
<unk> more than five billion <unk> , more than 30 billion <unk> <unk> .
That means 100 million <unk> a day .
When we try to find <unk> <unk> , or any kind of process to <unk> , it will be a huge challenge .
We have to <unk> all the CO2 <unk> from these materials that <unk> in the atmosphere .
At the day , because of the <unk> <unk> around the world , we have a <unk> with about 20 million genes of genes , and I like to think that are <unk> <unk> for the future .
The industry <unk> only one <unk> about <unk> , and think about how many different things are out .
Our <unk> here are data from the <unk> reality and our imagination .
We have now <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , so that we call <unk> <unk> .
We 're able to build a big robot that can produce a million <unk> a day .
Think about <unk> these 20 million genes or <unk> to try to <unk> <unk> or <unk> , new <unk> , we can change , <unk> , <unk> , we can change , because of a small team , and create more biology now than in the last 20 years of science .
And it 's just a standard <unk> .
We can choose to <unk> , <unk> <unk> , chemistry or <unk> , production of <unk> <unk> .
This is a <unk> of some software <unk> that we 're working on which we 're working on to be able to <unk> and design species to the computer .
Well , we don 't know how they 're going to be .
We know exactly what their <unk> code .
We 're going to have to be <unk> on <unk> generation .
You 've also seen you who <unk> <unk> from <unk> was a <unk> experiment .
We have <unk> <unk> <unk> and third generation that we had enough soon from <unk> to <unk> than <unk> <unk> or different kinds of <unk> .
But the only way that biology can have a big impact without <unk> <unk> the cost of food and <unk> the <unk> would be <unk> CO2 in matter before , so we 're working on to design that can achieve this <unk> , and we 're working for cells that can achieve this purpose , and we think we can have the first <unk> <unk> of <unk> generation in about 18 months .
<unk> light <unk> with CO2 is a <unk> , but in our <unk> <unk> around the world , we found different <unk> .
This is a <unk> that we <unk> in <unk> .
It 's about <unk> meters of <unk> feet at the temperature of <unk> water .
<unk> <unk> from CO2 using hydrogen <unk> as hydrogen <unk> as hydrogen .
We 're trying to understand whether we can <unk> CO2 , that can easily be <unk> by <unk> , <unk> that CO2 in <unk> , to drive this process .
So we think we can be able to <unk> what the basic question that the basic question that is what the basic question is , we , we <unk> the <unk> goal to <unk> the whole industry .
<unk> . If you can 't do that from TED , where can you ?
It 's going to be a <unk> source of energy .
<unk> , we 're working for using the same <unk> to create <unk> .
You saw this year with flu , we 're always back a year and with a dollar in less when it 's about finding the right <unk> .
I think that 's what you can do is <unk> <unk> in <unk> .
Here 's how the future could start <unk> , now , the tree of evolution , <unk> evolution with bacteria , <unk> , <unk> cells , and then <unk> cells .
We 're in so <unk> from <unk> people .
Our purpose is to do so so we 're going to be <unk> enough for <unk> . Thank you very much .
<unk> I 'm going to show you , the <unk> <unk> , some <unk> work , a new technology that we took to <unk> <unk> a <unk> almost a year ago . This is <unk> .
It 's a environment that you can <unk> it 's at local level that you can <unk> with a huge amount of data .
Here we are seeing <unk> <unk> <unk> with a kind of <unk> <unk> and <unk> , for a quick <unk> , <unk> , <unk> the images as we want .
And it doesn 't matter how big the amount of information that we see , how big these <unk> are these <unk> of data or <unk> .
Most of them are common photographs , but this is a <unk> <unk> by <unk> , and <unk> in <unk> <unk> , and <unk> in the <unk> of 300 <unk> .
It doesn 't make any difference because the only thing you <unk> the <unk> of a system like this is the number of <unk> on your screen in any moment at any time . It 's also a very <unk> architecture .
This is a whole book , example of data not images .
This is the <unk> <unk> <unk> . Every <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
So , to <unk> that 's just about <unk> and not images , we can do something like that , to actually see that it 's a real <unk> <unk> , not a picture of the text <unk> , not of a picture .
It could be a little bit <unk> to read a book .
I 'm not going to tell you .
This is a <unk> example . This is a number of <unk> <unk> .
Every picture is the beginning of a <unk> .
And it really gives you the pleasure and the <unk> experience of <unk> or a <unk> , which is <unk> <unk> <unk> .
We also did something with the <unk> of this particular number of <unk> , in particular <unk> .
We created a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> than that it uses in a normal <unk> and we <unk> in a normal <unk> and we <unk> in the <unk> content .
If you want to see the <unk> of this <unk> , you can see it here .
Or other models , or even <unk> <unk> .
And this is really <unk> some of these ideas to <unk> the <unk> of space on the screen .
And I think this <unk> would be able to <unk> and other <unk> <unk> , not <unk> to be <unk> .
Of course , the <unk> is one of the most <unk> <unk> for this kind of technology .
And on this one I don 't want to lose time , if we don 't say that we have <unk> <unk> to give it in this field .
These are all the streets in the United States <unk> , a <unk> picture of the NASA <unk> .
So now we 're going to start something else .
This is now actually living on the web ; you can see it .
It 's a project called <unk> , which <unk> two different technologies .
One is <unk> and the other is a <unk> research that 's very interesting that made by <unk> <unk> <unk> , a <unk> student of Washington , with the help of <unk> <unk> <unk> . It 's a <unk> <unk> .
And it 's alive on the web , <unk> <unk> .
You can see when we do this kind of <unk> , where we can go from one picture to another and have this kind of experience in <unk> <unk> .
But the <unk> <unk> of the images here actually has a meaning .
So , the <unk> <unk> of <unk> computers have <unk> these pictures together , so that we can <unk> the places that <unk> all the <unk> <unk> <unk> on the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> are <unk> . <unk> are <unk> . <unk> . <unk> you see some <unk> <unk> , and these things are all <unk> at the <unk> level .
I don 't know if I have time to show you some other environment .
There are a lot more <unk> .
I want to go directly to one of the <unk> of <unk> data and this <unk> by a <unk> <unk> that we made for the first time , I 'm going to work for the first time , I 'm going to be really the key behind this technology , <unk> technology . And it 's not <unk> <unk> <unk> , and it 's not <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , we 've done in the website .
We had to <unk> <unk> and so forth .
This is a <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> and <unk> images of <unk> in <unk> , other than <unk> , other than <unk> and so on . And we 're going to be <unk> <unk> a picture that 's <unk> to this .
So they 're all <unk> images from <unk> and they 're all <unk> <unk> to <unk> .
And it 's possible to <unk> this <unk> way .
You know , I would never have thought to work for <unk> .
It 's very <unk> <unk> <unk> this kind of <unk> here .
I think you 're going to be a lot of different kinds of <unk> : that 's cell phones <unk> <unk> , a <unk> number , <unk> <unk> , a <unk> number , <unk> together in this environment .
And if I can , I can <unk> to look for those <unk> .
Many are <unk> by <unk> , etc .
There 's a series of photographs -- <unk> -- <unk> .
This is a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
We can go from <unk> to physics of this environment .
The <unk> point is that we can do things with social environment . This is now <unk> data from the whole memory memory <unk> of how to <unk> the Earth , from the <unk> point of view and <unk> all that data together .
All of those pictures become <unk> together , and more than <unk> .
You 've got a <unk> model .
Think about this as <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> on Earth .
It 's something that you 're going to be <unk> as people who <unk> it , and the <unk> for those who are <unk> with the use .
Their pictures are <unk> with <unk> <unk> from other people .
If someone comes the idea of <unk> all these <unk> <unk> <unk> , my name , my picture of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> all of that data , and I can use it as a <unk> <unk> to <unk> in that space , in that <unk> , by <unk> the <unk> of anyone else , and have a social experience <unk> and <unk> .
Of course , a <unk> of this is <unk> <unk> models of every interesting part of the Earth , <unk> , <unk> not just by <unk> <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> , but the memory .
Thank you very much .
Chris Anderson : I understand ? What your software is going to take a certain point , in the next years , all the photographs <unk> that are <unk> <unk> by anyone in the world will be <unk> <unk> together ?
<unk> : Yeah . What 's doing is basically <unk> .
It 's creating <unk> , if you want , between pictures .
And it 's <unk> it 's <unk> .
And the thing becomes very interesting if you think about the <unk> information <unk> that many of these <unk> images .
As when you do a research <unk> on the web , you <unk> a <unk> and the text on the page , has a lot of information about images .
Now , what happens if that picture is going on if that picture is going on to be ?
So the amount of <unk> <unk> and the amount of <unk> that <unk> is really enormous . It 's a <unk> effect of the network .
CA : <unk> , it 's really incredible .
<unk> : I 'm going to tell you very much .
One of the major <unk> when you <unk> and one of the <unk> research is to be able to live in who has no <unk> <unk> , <unk> the past in the wind , the <unk> <unk> <unk> from <unk> , <unk> <unk> from <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> from <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
You think that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> still beyond <unk> <unk> , or that <unk> <unk> are still <unk> <unk> , or that <unk> <unk> are still <unk> of <unk> , or <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> still the <unk> <unk> <unk> , to <unk> the <unk> of <unk> , and that the idea that the world in which we live in which , there is only a reality that the idea of reality is just a <unk> model , but it 's a reality that the idea of reality that we are are still not in reality that that the <unk> of reality that the <unk>
the <unk> of a particular <unk> <unk> of <unk> choices that our <unk> has done , good or evil , many <unk> ago .
And , of course , all of the <unk> <unk> .
Everybody <unk> . All <unk> .
We 're <unk> to <unk> <unk> .
We have to <unk> the <unk> of death , so we don 't <unk> us if we <unk> and <unk> --
We all have a art .
What <unk> is the particular <unk> of the song , the <unk> of every culture .
It doesn 't matter that they 're <unk> <unk> <unk> , or <unk> <unk> <unk> , or the <unk> <unk> <unk> , or the <unk> <unk> <unk> , or <unk> <unk> <unk> , or a <unk> in <unk> <unk> .
He was my <unk> <unk> in the <unk> a month ago , or a <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> , on <unk> , on <unk> , on <unk> , on <unk> , <unk> , <unk> mother 's mother in the world .
All of these <unk> <unk> that there are other ways of <unk> other ways of thinking , other ways of moving around the world .
And , if you <unk> a second , it 's a concept that can give you hope .
<unk> , <unk> <unk> of <unk> in the world create a <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> that <unk> the planet and it 's important for the <unk> of the planet as <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And you can think about this <unk> <unk> as a <unk> and you can <unk> the <unk> of all the <unk> , dreams , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> to be by the human imagination of the <unk> .
<unk> is the <unk> of humanity .
It 's the <unk> of what we are and what we can be in as <unk> species .
And <unk> the <unk> was <unk> <unk> <unk> was successful at <unk> and <unk> a lot <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , for example , <unk> <unk> that 50 percent of all species has been or is on the <unk> of <unk> , just because it 's <unk> , or -- in the <unk> <unk> -- in the <unk> <unk> -- and you don 't even even even <unk> to <unk> <unk> -- that the <unk> diversity .
The <unk> of this is , of course , the <unk> <unk> .
When you 're <unk> <unk> <unk> on this planet .
A language is not only <unk> by a <unk> or a series of rules .
A language is the <unk> of the human spirit .
It 's the medium with which the <unk> of every culture comes in the world .
Every language is a forest of the mind , a <unk> , a thought , a <unk> of <unk> .
And of those <unk> <unk> , while we 're sitting here at least half the <unk> is not <unk> in the <unk> of children .
They 're not going to be <unk> to children , which means less than <unk> something , they 're already death .
What 's more <unk> of being <unk> by <unk> , to be the last last to talk a language , not <unk> the way to <unk> <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> the <unk> of <unk> or <unk> the <unk> of <unk> ?
This <unk> <unk> was a few weeks in some part of the world every two weeks : every two weeks , a <unk> <unk> and door with it in the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And I know that somebody of you say , " Don 't it much better ?
The world wouldn 't be a better place if we all the same language ? " So , then we 're all <unk> . <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> .
We 're going to be <unk> what it means that we can 't speak their own language .
Today I 'd like to show you a journey to <unk> through <unk> --
a little journey in <unk> to give you a <unk> of what we 're <unk> .
Many of us <unk> that when I say " different ways of <unk> , " I mean , really different ways of <unk> .
<unk> for example this <unk> <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , which <unk> <unk> <unk> , which <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> from the <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> <unk> .
It 's a <unk> that 's not able to <unk> the blue color in the green because the <unk> is <unk> in the <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> .
They have a <unk> language and a <unk> rule , " <unk> <unk> <unk> . " <unk> <unk> : you 've got a person talking a different language .
All of this has <unk> in the past <unk> , but the <unk> is that in these <unk> families in which they talk to six or seven <unk> because of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
You <unk> to hear and then we start talking about .
<unk> one of the most interesting <unk> that I lived , the <unk> <unk> <unk> , an incredible <unk> that had the first <unk> in <unk> .
In <unk> five <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> .
They made <unk> from the top pictures that <unk> them in <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> that this <unk> of <unk> forest <unk> never seen anything about <unk> .
They <unk> the picture from the ground , they <unk> them to <unk> a form or a <unk> , not <unk> anything , they <unk> . They <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and they <unk> the five <unk> with <unk> .
But <unk> not only <unk> <unk> .
They <unk> in their own .
<unk> percent <unk> <unk> was <unk> by themselves .
We 're <unk> to eight <unk> and found two <unk> <unk> , and when we <unk> to know , they <unk> that one of them was <unk> so that he died , and then they <unk> it .
<unk> were able to recognize the animal <unk> from 40 <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> , and I was a really interesting task when my <unk> <unk> <unk> me if I wanted to go to <unk> <unk> in <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> in society , and <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
To give a sense of <unk> , I should have understand <unk> culture and that <unk> is not <unk> <unk> .
It 's pretty much about a <unk> view of the world .
Very interesting .
If you ask you to <unk> the great <unk> of the world , what would you like to me ?
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , etc .
A continent always <unk> out , thinking that <unk> Africa doesn 't have <unk> <unk> . And instead and <unk> is not the <unk> of these <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> <unk> .
What makes the <unk> is the <unk> relationship between life and death .
So <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> can be <unk> by <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> to the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> and <unk> <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> , so that for a short <unk> , it becomes the <unk> .
So , this is the <unk> <unk> , " <unk> <unk> , you go to <unk> God .
We <unk> in <unk> and <unk> God . "
And from the moment that you 're <unk> , is the spirit that <unk> you can <unk> you , how do you <unk> ?
So , you <unk> to these incredible events : <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a fairly <unk> of the power of the body 's <unk> , when it 's <unk> in a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> all the <unk> with which I lived with the <unk> are the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , in <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> of <unk> civilization that once <unk> on the <unk> <unk> of <unk> in <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> on the <unk> <unk> <unk> , which <unk> on the <unk> <unk> .
In a <unk> continent , this <unk> never been <unk> by <unk> .
<unk> today are <unk> by a <unk> but their education is extraordinary .
<unk> <unk> are <unk> by <unk> to three or four years , and they 're <unk> in a world <unk> and <unk> in <unk> <unk> <unk> for 18 years .
Two <unk> <unk> years of nine years of <unk> <unk> that <unk> in the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> .
For all this time , they 're <unk> to values that their own society , values that <unk> that their <unk> and only their <unk> <unk> <unk> -- or to say <unk> <unk> .
Al <unk> of this incredible <unk> , they 're <unk> <unk> out and for the first time in their life , at the age of 18 , see a <unk> . And in that moment of <unk> <unk> of <unk> , everything they have been <unk> in theory , everything they have been <unk> in <unk> . The <unk> is <unk> , everything they have been <unk> in <unk> . <unk> ago , and he 's a <unk> <unk> .
" <unk> ? I 'm going to tell you .
It 's <unk> . Now it 's <unk> . "
They call them major and they say that we , <unk> <unk> , we are the <unk> <unk> of the world .
This is extremely important .
When we think about <unk> and the environment <unk> <unk> and the old history of <unk> <unk> , which is a <unk> concept in his <unk> or maybe <unk> <unk> <unk> and we say that these <unk> are <unk> <unk> to the Earth .
<unk> <unk> are not <unk> or <unk> from <unk> .
There is no space for these things in the <unk> <unk> of <unk> , but because of time and <unk> , and <unk> , they created a <unk> of the Earth <unk> , and created a <unk> of the Earth <unk> <unk> , but on a <unk> <unk> <unk> , the concept that the Earth can live only live because it 's <unk> by the <unk> .
What does it mean ?
It means that a <unk> of <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> the mountain is a <unk> spirit that <unk> its <unk> is going to be a human <unk> <unk> . It 's going to be a <unk> <unk> <unk> with a mountain or that <unk> <unk> that <unk> a mountain is a <unk> <unk> to be <unk> .
which is a spirit of a spirit or a <unk> <unk> is <unk> .
What 's interesting is the <unk> that <unk> the relationship between <unk> and <unk> .
I grew up in the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that the <unk> <unk> to be <unk> .
And that made me a human being different from my <unk> friends who believe that <unk> are the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> that live in the <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> that live in the <unk> <unk> .
If you <unk> that these <unk> can actually create different , we can actually make different <unk> , we can actually start to understand some of them . We 're going to be <unk> , and we can actually make a <unk> .
I <unk> this picture in <unk> in <unk> <unk> .
Maybe some of you 've heard about <unk> , the most powerful <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
What makes <unk> is not the potential of <unk> , but his <unk> . It 's <unk> by two elements .
On one side , this <unk> <unk> <unk> a series of <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
<unk> the only <unk> <unk> <unk> a little bit <unk> <unk> that <unk> , but it 's <unk> with <unk> <unk> of a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
This <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , very similar to <unk> , <unk> .
If you ever see the <unk> <unk> on the <unk> , the <unk> that they 're doing a different <unk> of species , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> that <unk> on the <unk> is a little bit like being <unk> by a <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> on a sea of electricity . It doesn 't create a <unk> of electricity . It doesn 't create a <unk> of <unk> , <unk> .
I often <unk> with my <unk> , Richard <unk> <unk> , the man who <unk> was <unk> , with his discovery of <unk> <unk> in the ' <unk> in the ' <unk> .
<unk> my <unk> can 't be <unk> these <unk> as <unk> because if you 're <unk> , because if you 're <unk> , you can 't tell anybody to be <unk> <unk> because they 're <unk> by a <unk> that 's <unk> in <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
It 's possible to <unk> <unk> only if you could <unk> with other <unk> <unk> that <unk> the <unk> .
Now it 's the beautiful : the <unk> that are in this <unk> are <unk> <unk> , <unk> of the same <unk> that you need to <unk> <unk> . The question <unk> <unk> : in a <unk> <unk> species of plants , like these <unk> to <unk> two <unk> <unk> , but that if you <unk> in this way , they create a <unk> version that is <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
We use the great <unk> of <unk> and <unk> , which can <unk> <unk> .
But if you go to the <unk> , we 'll be " The plants talk . "
What does it mean ?
This <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , which <unk> <unk> in the forest , and that <unk> our eyes in the same species .
If you <unk> like <unk> <unk> <unk> , " <unk> <unk> " <unk> " <unk> " <unk> " <unk> " <unk> . "
The solution is : you take <unk> <unk> in a night night , <unk> <unk> <unk> with a different <unk> .
And this is not <unk> to <unk> , but it 's much more interesting than <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Now , [ <unk> ] the problem is that even the ones that are <unk> <unk> <unk> them , but in some <unk> way to the <unk> of history than our real world , and <unk> beyond .
In fact , the <unk> century , in 300 years , not <unk> <unk> for his <unk> or his <unk> <unk> , but rather like the <unk> was where we <unk> and <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of the <unk> diversity of <unk> and <unk> and <unk> on the planet . Now , the problem is not the change .
All the <unk> through <unk> have been <unk> in a <unk> for new possibilities .
And the problem is not technology .
<unk> <unk> have no <unk> to be <unk> when they put <unk> <unk> and <unk> like <unk> , they <unk> , they <unk> , and they <unk> them to be <unk> when they put <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
It 's not the change or technology that <unk> <unk> <unk> . It 's the power .
The <unk> <unk> of <unk> .
And if you look at a look at the world , you 'll see that these are not <unk> <unk> to <unk> .
They 're <unk> creatures and <unk> <unk> out of the <unk> <unk> that are beyond their ability to <unk> .
<unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> --
a <unk> <unk> <unk> , where you can see the <unk> <unk> , a <unk> that lived in the forest to a generation ago , and now <unk> to the <unk> and the <unk> on the <unk> of <unk> , where you can see the <unk> <unk> from the <unk> , where you can see the <unk> <unk> <unk> , where the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , where the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> ,
We 're going to <unk> the <unk> with the <unk> <unk> to the forest .
Or , in the case of <unk> , are the disease that are <unk> with <unk> discovery .
If we <unk> on the <unk> of <unk> , where I 'm doing a lot of research , you 'll see the <unk> <unk> of politics .
As a <unk> <unk> , <unk> physics of a <unk> , is <unk> <unk> <unk> , but <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , not only is <unk> , but <unk> <unk> in certain <unk> , not only is <unk> , but <unk> <unk> <unk> in certain <unk> , because it 's part of the development of <unk> .
And you can 't understand the <unk> of <unk> until you get from the beginning .
I <unk> the <unk> miles from <unk> in the <unk> <unk> , and <unk> to <unk> with a young <unk> , but only got to <unk> with a young <unk> , but only <unk> <unk> to <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> million people <unk> from the <unk> during the <unk> <unk> .
The father of this guy was <unk> to <unk> <unk> .
The that means that it was <unk> to the Chinese times .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> with <unk> <unk> during the <unk> that led to <unk> .
My mother was <unk> and his <unk> was <unk> .
It was taken to <unk> in <unk> at age two years of <unk> under his <unk> because he could not have no <unk> .
The <unk> , who did the same , was <unk> in <unk> <unk> .
One day he <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> , and for this <unk> , was <unk> to <unk> <unk> for seven years .
The pain of <unk> can be <unk> , but the <unk> spirit of <unk> is <unk> by <unk> <unk> .
At the end , everything <unk> <unk> to a choice .
Do you have to live in the <unk> world of diversity , or we want to <unk> the diversity of diversity ?
The great <unk> <unk> <unk> , before she died , he said that his greatest fear was that , in our <unk> to go to this <unk> view of the human imagination <unk> to a <unk> of human imagination , <unk> to a <unk> <unk> <unk> of thinking , but a day we <unk> <unk> <unk> that there were other possibilities .
And it 's <unk> to remember that our species is <unk> for <unk> years .
The <unk> <unk> , which has given us to <unk> , which <unk> us to <unk> <unk> , <unk> the <unk> of <unk> with <unk> , creating the <unk> of <unk> with <unk> , creating the <unk> <unk> , creating the <unk> <unk> , and we talk about <unk> years ago .
The <unk> world has <unk> 300 years .
That <unk> story , I didn 't know that we have answers to all the challenges that we <unk> to <unk> in <unk> .
When these <unk> <unk> of <unk> in the world , it 's asked what it means to be human , <unk> with <unk> different <unk> .
And it 's in these answers that we all <unk> the chance to be what we are , a species , that has to <unk> that all the <unk> and all the <unk> can <unk> . And there are great times .
I <unk> this picture on the north of <unk> island , when I went to <unk> <unk> with <unk> , and this man , <unk> , and this man , <unk> , <unk> me of his wonderful story of <unk> .
The <unk> government wasn 't always <unk> with the <unk> <unk> and in the ' <unk> to <unk> our <unk> , and we <unk> them in <unk> .
The <unk> of this man <unk> <unk> .
The family , <unk> for his life , <unk> <unk> away all the <unk> , and all his <unk> .
You know that <unk> don 't <unk> the cold , <unk> it .
The <unk> of <unk> were made of <unk> fish <unk> in <unk> .
The <unk> of this man didn 't <unk> from night , or from the <unk> that <unk> .
It 's <unk> away , it 's <unk> the <unk> <unk> and <unk> in his hand . When I did it , he <unk> it , he <unk> it <unk> it .
He <unk> <unk> on the <unk> of this <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> , he <unk> a dog .
He <unk> the dog and created a <unk> , with the <unk> <unk> has created a <unk> , has <unk> a <unk> , and it 's <unk> on the <unk> , <unk> <unk> in <unk> .
What about <unk> ?
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
It 's their new <unk> . It 's called <unk> .
It 's a <unk> <unk> . It 's going to <unk> all the <unk> resources .
One <unk> example of how a <unk> can <unk> with his <unk> .
And , to end , I think it 's pretty <unk> at least at least who we have been in these <unk> <unk> <unk> on the planet , and I realize that they 're not not going to happen at all .
For somebody is home .
<unk> <unk> of the human imagination that <unk> to <unk> . And for us all , the dreams of these children , like our children dreams , as our children , become part of hope .
To end , we <unk> <unk> <unk> , we <unk> that <unk> never <unk> .
I 'm going to say that <unk> --
[ <unk> ] they 're not <unk> , but we believe that stories can change the world , and maybe we are the best <unk> to tell the stories of the world . Every month our site <unk> <unk> million <unk> .
<unk> <unk> : <unk> our <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Our <unk> are <unk> by millions of people .
Our work is <unk> in <unk> to bring our audience to our audience in places that <unk> <unk> from which <unk> <unk> from which <unk> <unk> from how much they saw and , and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> world , and we have to find a <unk> of life in a <unk> world . And we need to find a <unk> world in a <unk> world and <unk> .
where the <unk> of all <unk> can <unk> to our <unk> <unk> .
Thank you .
I 'm going to tell you about some things I wrote in this book that I hope you 've heard some <unk> and <unk> to <unk> some <unk> , in case you don 't know .
I want to start with what I call " <unk> <unk> <unk> . "
<unk> <unk> of what ?
The <unk> <unk> of all society <unk> <unk> . The <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , " If we want to <unk> <unk> <unk> . "
The reason is , on one side , in fact that freedom is in itself a value , is <unk> , <unk> , <unk> for humans .
<unk> more is in fact that if we 're <unk> , each of us to act to do everything that we <unk> our <unk> , without anybody who <unk> in our own own own <unk> , without anybody who <unk> in our own own own .
The way to <unk> the freedom is to <unk> the choice .
More choices people have , more <unk> are <unk> , and more they 're <unk> , and more than their <unk> ,
This , <unk> , it 's so <unk> <unk> in society that nobody <unk> <unk> in <unk> .
And it 's also <unk> <unk> in our lives .
I 'm going to show you some examples of what progress has made possible .
This is my <unk> . It 's not particularly big .
I <unk> a simple note about <unk> to <unk> .
In my <unk> , there are <unk> <unk> <unk> , without <unk> the 10 <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and 12 <unk> <unk> you can buy a huge number of <unk> in <unk> <unk> that nobody of <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> that nobody of <unk> <unk> is <unk> to be <unk> .
Here 's what the <unk> is what <unk> is .
Then you go to the <unk> store for buy a <unk> : <unk> , radio , <unk> , <unk> , radio , <unk> , <unk> .
And in this single <unk> store , there 's a big number of <unk> <unk> .
We can do six million different <unk> using the <unk> that there are in one <unk> .
<unk> <unk> that there is <unk> choice .
<unk> <unk> : the world of <unk> .
Once , when I was a child , you could get all the services <unk> , <unk> <unk> that were <unk> by <unk> <unk> .
You <unk> the phone , you 're not going to <unk> it .
One of that , in the other , was that the phone never <unk> .
These times they went .
We have a <unk> <unk> <unk> , especially in the cell phones .
Here 's the phones phones .
My <unk> is in the middle , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> .
If you haven 't seen this one , you 're very <unk> that soon you 're very soon <unk> .
And what happens is that people <unk> <unk> in <unk> and does this question . And you know , what 's the answer ? The answer is , " No . "
It 's not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn 't make things things .
So , in other ways of life that are much more important than <unk> , <unk> the same <unk> of choices .
<unk> <unk> : You don 't happen to the United States that you 're going to be <unk> from <unk> and <unk> you what you 're going to do .
Instead , you get out of the <unk> , and the <unk> says , " OK , we can do it . " Or , we can do it . " And he 's got these <unk> and <unk> , " <unk> have these <unk> and <unk> . What do you want to do ? "
You were the <unk> , " <unk> , what do you want to do ? "
And the <unk> says , " <unk> has these <unk> and <unk> , and <unk> has these <unk> and <unk> . "
" What do you want to do ? "
And you say , " <unk> if she was me , what ? "
And the <unk> , " But I 'm not her . "
We call the " <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> that makes it seem a beautiful thing .
But actually , it 's not a <unk> that <unk> the weight and responsibility to make decisions from someone who knows something , <unk> the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and almost certainly is <unk> -- and so not in the <unk> <unk> to make it .
There 's a huge <unk> of <unk> products , <unk> to people like me and you , if you think about it doesn 't make any sense , because we can 't <unk> .
But if we can 't <unk> , why do we <unk> them ?
The answer is that they want to <unk> , we call the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> of that <unk> as a <unk> is our <unk> now is a question of choice , as you see in this <unk> . " We don 't want to <unk> the kids . <unk> their sex at the right now . " Don 't <unk> a <unk> . " We don 't have a <unk> <unk> .
And we can <unk> how many times we <unk> .
which means that every <unk> , <unk> , you have to decide that kind of person you want to be .
And I 'm going to go to the family and <unk> , a <unk> perspective , almost anyone , was that you <unk> the <unk> as possible , and you can get kids to <unk> the <unk> <unk> .
The only real choice was with who , not when , and not , what to do later .
<unk> , everything is really to play .
They 're going to be very smart students , and they <unk> them to <unk> , 20 percent in less work than a time .
And not because they 're not <unk> , not because they 're not <unk> .
but why am <unk> , I 'm <unk> , I 'm going to say , " <unk> <unk> <unk> or not ? "
" <unk> <unk> <unk> ? " I have to think about children or career or to be ? "
They 're <unk> <unk> .
And they try to answer these questions , even if this <unk> doesn 't <unk> the <unk> that <unk> and not get a beautiful <unk> to my <unk> .
And they really have to do that . They 're important questions .
Now , the work is <unk> , as <unk> <unk> , because technology technology <unk> us to work every day , from every day , from every day , on the planet , <unk> from <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , there is a <unk> , and I 'm not going to say anybody who , where the <unk> works .
I 'm not going to tell you , because I want to use it .
What does , this incredible freedom to do we have about work ? It 's that we need to decide , <unk> at any time , if we have to work or not .
We can go to see our child to <unk> , with the cell phone in a <unk> , the <unk> in one , and the <unk> , <unk> .
And even if I 'm all <unk> , every minute that we see our child , we 're also <unk> , " I have to answer this call ? "
" I have to answer this <unk> ? I have to <unk> this letter ? "
And even when the answer is , " no , " that makes it <unk> experience of your son very different from what would be in other conditions .
So , from any <unk> , you look at things , little and big things , materials and big things , and <unk> of life is a question of choices .
Once the world was this : <unk> , there were some possibilities , but it was not a question of choice .
The world of today is <unk> to this : The <unk> is , " Is it a <unk> thing , or <unk> ? "
The answer is <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> , we all know , so I 'm going to talk about the <unk> .
<unk> this choice <unk> two effects effects of people .
The first , <unk> , is that it <unk> <unk> instead of <unk> .
With a lot of <unk> between which to choose , it becomes very difficult to do it .
I 'll give you a <unk> example , a <unk> study on <unk> <unk> .
A <unk> of my <unk> had access to <unk> <unk> , with about a million <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> , with about a million <unk> in <unk> companies .
What she found is that for every 10 solutions that are <unk> in more , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
With 50 <unk> <unk> , there 's 10 percent in less <unk> than <unk> , when they 're only five to available . Why ?
Because with 50 <unk> <unk> between which <unk> , is <unk> difficult to decide , and the choice is <unk> to <unk> .
And in <unk> , and again , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and of course , <unk> never comes .
<unk> that doesn 't mean only means that these <unk> <unk> <unk> food to <unk> because they 're not going to have enough money , he wants to to say that the decision is so <unk> that we can also <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of work .
They 're not <unk> , they 're <unk> <unk> <unk> for <unk> year from <unk> , which would be <unk> <unk> .
So <unk> is a <unk> of <unk> choices .
And I think it <unk> the world like this .
" And to end up , to <unk> : <unk> , <unk> , <unk> or <unk> ? "
You 're going to be <unk> , if it 's for <unk> , right ?
You don 't want to choose the wrong <unk> , and you 're going to <unk> the wrong <unk> .
So this is the first effect . The second is that even if we can <unk> <unk> and make a choice , at the end , we are less <unk> by the result of how to <unk> states with less <unk> between which to choose .
And that 's why .
One of them is that with many <unk> between which to choose , if you <unk> one and it 's not perfect , it 's easy to imagine that they could be better . And what happens is that the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to us to <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> <unk> from <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> <unk> from <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> <unk> from <unk> ,
even when it was a <unk> decision .
More choices there are , <unk> , <unk> is <unk> <unk> of any <unk> that 's <unk> .
<unk> , there is what <unk> call .
Dan <unk> has <unk> very well <unk> like the value that we give things to things from what <unk> <unk> .
<unk> rest , when there are many <unk> possible , it 's easy to <unk> the <unk> of <unk> <unk> and be less <unk> than <unk> that 's choice .
Here 's one example . I 'm <unk> with all the people who are not in New York .
But that 's what you probably <unk> .
There 's this <unk> to <unk> .
A <unk> place of <unk> .
<unk> <unk> . <unk> day . It 's all about them .
It doesn 't know anything . But what he thinks is , " Well , <unk> , it 's <unk> . "
" All my <unk> <unk> are <unk> . "
" <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . "
And it <unk> two weeks from the idea that 's going to <unk> -- every day -- the chance of <unk> where it wants .
The <unk> <unk> <unk> for what we have , even when the choice was <unk> .
And the <unk> are the <unk> we have from <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> on how to <unk> .
Here 's another example .
This <unk> tells us a lot of things .
It 's about living the moment , and maybe in slowly .
But the most important point is that anything you 're going to be , you 're going to be <unk> .
The things that they don 't <unk> a lot of <unk> that can make less <unk> what we do .
<unk> point : <unk> <unk> <unk> .
I tried it on my skin a new couple of <unk> .
It almost always <unk> .
Once the <unk> were only <unk> , and they were <unk> , and <unk> by <unk> , only after <unk> <unk> a life <unk> and <unk> a lot of times , <unk> to go right .
So , I went to <unk> a new couple when the <unk> were gone , and I said , " I need a couple of <unk> , this is my <unk> . "
The <unk> said , " <unk> wants to <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> ? "
You want them to <unk> or <unk> ? " <unk> " <unk> " or " <unk> " ? "
" <unk> wants to <unk> ? "
" <unk> <unk> wants to <unk> or <unk> ? <unk> <unk> <unk> -- " <unk> . "
I was <unk> , and after a little bit I was able to say , " I want the guy that was the only kind of -- that was the only kind of -- that for a time now , I <unk> all <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and then I was <unk> all the time I had ever had .
It was the <unk> . With all that choice I had <unk> the best .
But I 'm going to get worse .
Why ? I wrote a whole book to <unk> .
And the reason I was worse is that with all my <unk> were <unk> , <unk> <unk> to be <unk> .
At the beginning I had <unk> <unk> . I didn 't know anything about <unk> when I <unk> only one guy , but when we <unk> 100 different , <unk> , at least a kind of <unk> had to be perfect .
What I had <unk> was good , but not perfect .
After <unk> that I <unk> with what I was <unk> in <unk> to <unk> .
The <unk> of <unk> in the lives of people don 't make <unk> <unk> that these <unk> <unk> that these <unk> <unk> .
And this <unk> <unk> , even when the results are good .
<unk> in the world of <unk> if it makes it .
Because if you <unk> it , I 'm not talking about what I 'm talking about .
The truth is going to be more to this .
And it was <unk> when you were worse , " The reason why he was <unk> when he was worse , when he was even even even even even <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> , in the world that we live in -- <unk> , <unk> citizens with <unk> <unk> -- the <unk> that we can <unk> is that things are <unk> to <unk> .
You 've never ever <unk> <unk> , because your <unk> , my <unk> , <unk> .
The <unk> of happiness -- what you 're here -- is , " <unk> <unk> <unk> " Yes , you want it . "
I mean , little <unk> moment -- who I 'm really <unk> and my wife is really <unk> .
I couldn 't do better , I couldn 't do better , I <unk> .
But <unk> isn 't always a <unk> thing .
<unk> , a <unk> of <unk> <unk> a couple of <unk> <unk> when there is only that you 're not <unk> , and you 're not <unk> , and I 'm going to tell you , " Why ? "
" Who is <unk> ? " The answer is <unk> . "
The world is <unk> . What can I do do I do ?
When there are hundreds of kinds of <unk> , and you <unk> one <unk> , and you <unk> a <unk> , and you know who the <unk> is clear that the <unk> are you <unk> .
We could have better <unk> .
With hundreds of <unk> available , there are no <unk> for <unk> .
So when people make decisions , even if the result is <unk> , they <unk> <unk> and they 're <unk> to their own .
In the last few years , the <unk> is <unk> in <unk> world .
I think a <unk> <unk> -- not the only , but important -- of this <unk> <unk> is really their people have <unk> experiences because <unk> are too <unk> .
And when they have to <unk> this situation they think it 's their <unk> .
So the final result is that we 're better , <unk> , but we <unk> it worse .
Let me tell you .
This is the <unk> <unk> , what we all take good and it 's completely <unk> . It 's not true .
There is no <unk> that a little bit of choice is better than <unk> than <unk> , but it 's not a <unk> that a lot of choice is better than a little bit better than a little bit .
There 's a <unk> value , <unk> . I don 't know what it is .
But I 'm pretty sure we 've <unk> from a piece of the level that the choices <unk> our lives .
Now , from a <unk> perspective -- I almost almost finished -- from a <unk> point of view , <unk> is <unk> .
What it <unk> all this choice in society is the <unk> material .
There are many places in the world , and you know , <unk> <unk> , where the problem is not that they have <unk> choice .
The problem is that they have too <unk> .
So the <unk> I 'm talking about is a <unk> <unk> of <unk> , <unk> society .
And what <unk> does <unk> and <unk> is this : <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> you yesterday about how those <unk> and <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> are <unk> . It 's a <unk> <unk> of money .
I mean that these choices , <unk> and <unk> , is not that they 're just <unk> .
They 're <unk> <unk> .
They 're going to be worse .
If a little bit of what in our society <unk> <unk> choice was <unk> in those where people have too few people , wouldn 't be <unk> to <unk> , but also our own life .
This is what <unk> call a <unk> <unk> .
A <unk> of income does good for all -- not only the poor -- because of this choice in <unk> that <unk> us .
So , to end , " <unk> , you can become everything you want to --
<unk> , people of culture , <unk> , " But what do you do ? "
" It 's <unk> that you can 't do anything in a glass <unk> . "
" A <unk> <unk> , a <unk> <unk> view of the world --
and I <unk> it so , I <unk> it , at the beginning .
But then , <unk> , I realized that that that fish knows that that the long one knows .
Because the reality is that if you <unk> the <unk> , so that it 's possible . " You can 't <unk> the freedom . You can 't <unk> the freedom . You <unk> the <unk> .
If you <unk> the <unk> so that everything you can <unk> the <unk> .
It <unk> the <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Everybody needs a <unk> .
This is almost certainly too <unk> , maybe even for the fish , and certainly for us .
But the <unk> of some <unk> <unk> is a <unk> for <unk> and , <unk> , for <unk> .
Thank you very much .
