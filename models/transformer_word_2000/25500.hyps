<unk> year I showed these <unk> to <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , which for almost three million years has been the size of the United States <unk> , has been <unk> 40 percent .
And I 'm going to <unk> this <unk> because it 's not <unk> the ice <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> is , in a way , the heart <unk> of global warming .
It 's <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
The next <unk> is going to be a <unk> <unk> on the <unk> of the last 25 years .
<unk> <unk> are <unk> in red .
As you see , it 's <unk> up to the blue <unk> .
That 's the ice in <unk> , which is <unk> in summer .
You can see that the <unk> ice <unk> , of five years or more , it 's like blood , which here is from the body .
In 25 years , in the way , in the way .
This is a problem because the <unk> are <unk> to the <unk> <unk> around the ocean , where there are huge <unk> of <unk> that , <unk> , are <unk> <unk> in <unk> .
<unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> , the amount of <unk> , that <unk> could <unk> , that <unk> <unk> .
In some <unk> <unk> , the <unk> is already <unk> by the water .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> last <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> ! <unk> : She 's good . The question is if you <unk> it .
A reason is that this <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> from the north .
This is a <unk> river .
<unk> had never <unk> <unk> .
This is the <unk> river , in the <unk> of <unk> .
If you want to know how the sea <unk> to the <unk> <unk> on the <unk> <unk> , here is where the sea .
These <unk> are <unk> <unk> .
On the other hand , <unk> , the largest <unk> ice on the planet .
And last month , <unk> scientists have <unk> that the ice <unk> is in <unk> , and that <unk> <unk> on some <unk> <unk> , is particularly <unk> in <unk> .
<unk> at six feet of the <unk> , like <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , the <unk> third major <unk> of ice , you see new <unk> , that few years ago were <unk> .
<unk> percent of the world 's population <unk> water from that <unk> .
<unk> <unk> : This <unk> is the source of water .
<unk> is <unk> .
But when you <unk> , the same happens to the water .
In California , <unk> <unk> is 40 percent .
<unk> <unk> are in crisis .
<unk> , as you read , they 're <unk> .
<unk> <unk> in the world <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> are <unk> to a <unk> out of the normal and <unk> .
<unk> times more <unk> in the last 30 years than <unk> <unk> .
This is a <unk> of the <unk> .
If you look it in the <unk> context , if you can see the <unk> .
In the last five years , we 've <unk> 70 million <unk> of CO2 every 24 hours -- 25 million <unk> in the ocean every day .
Look at the area of the <unk> <unk> , from the <unk> , to <unk> , and both parts of the <unk> <unk> , where there 's a oxygen <unk> in the ocean .
The biggest cause of the global warming , together to <unk> , which is 20 percent , is the use of <unk> <unk> .
The oil is a problem , and <unk> is even worse .
The United States is one of the two countries with the <unk> emissions , together to China .
And it 's <unk> to build a lot of other <unk> .
But we 're <unk> to a <unk> direction .
These are the <unk> projects over the last few years , and some of <unk> <unk> .
And so , there is a political <unk> in our country .
The <unk> of <unk> and oil have <unk> <unk> million dollars in the last year to <unk> <unk> <unk> , which is a <unk> .
I 'm going to give me something --
<unk> <unk> , in <unk> , where I live , there was a <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
<unk> you saw it on the <unk> .
This is the second bigger flow of <unk> in America .
It happened around <unk> .
<unk> <unk> of one was this .
<unk> : <unk> ♫ ♫ <unk> the <unk> is a <unk> and happy guy .
It 's <unk> here in America , and it <unk> our economy .
<unk> <unk> is <unk> .
It 's <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Al <unk> : <unk> here is a lot of <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The largest <unk> society on the <unk> is <unk> . This is its <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> <unk> . <unk> <unk> : <unk> , <unk> <unk> -- not know what they 're talking about .
Al <unk> : So the <unk> for the <unk> <unk> has <unk> two <unk> .
This is one of them , one side .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> . We see <unk> <unk> changes as a <unk> <unk> .
So , for our <unk> is to <unk> a big amount of money in a <unk> <unk> to make public and <unk> and <unk> the truth on <unk> .
In fact , <unk> is not <unk> .
We think it 's <unk> -- it 's also good <unk> .
So we don 't understand climate change .
We need to do .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> <unk> -- you heard -- you heard <unk> a lot of it .
So , I 'm going to <unk> a <unk> in a <unk> , <unk> , as <unk> .
<unk> ! <unk> are a little bit <unk> , but that 's the sound of the technology <unk> .
<unk> <unk> is between the major <unk> of global warming , but the <unk> technology <unk> that you see all .
Let 's look : this is the <unk> technology <unk> .
Al <unk> : <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to the economic issue and the national security .
<unk> : <unk> America is in crisis ; the national security crisis .
The <unk> that <unk> all : our <unk> <unk> <unk> , like <unk> <unk> and oil .
But , there 's a new , <unk> solution to <unk> .
<unk> America : 100 percent of <unk> energy , in 10 years .
A plan to <unk> America at work , <unk> more <unk> , and help to <unk> global warming .
<unk> , a solution that we 're going to solve our problems .
<unk> America . <unk> more .
Al <unk> : This is the last one .
<unk> : It 's about <unk> energy to America .
One of the most <unk> ways to <unk> <unk> to the <unk> from the <unk> that <unk> our planet .
<unk> : The future is here . <unk> , a new network .
<unk> <unk> two : <unk> <unk> for jobs for jobs .
<unk> : <unk> America . It 's time to be <unk> .
Al <unk> : A old <unk> <unk> says , " If you want to go to , go to alone .
If you want to go away , you go to the <unk> . "
We need to go away , quickly .
Thank you very much .
<unk> year at TED I did a <unk> on <unk> .
And I 'm going to try to <unk> how the car works .
So , I 'm going to go . And for those that the other time , the <unk> is the largest scientific experiment ever <unk> -- <unk> miles of <unk> .
His task is to <unk> the conditions that were in the <unk> <unk> in the universe -- until <unk> million times a second .
All of that is just <unk> .
This is the car under <unk> .
So , I <unk> these <unk> <unk> into the <unk> .
This is what I work on . It 's called <unk> -- <unk> feet <unk> , and it has a <unk> <unk> .
This is a <unk> picture of building <unk> so you can see the <unk> .
<unk> <unk> last year , we <unk> the car car <unk> .
And this picture was <unk> by <unk> .
It was <unk> <unk> in the control room .
It 's an image of the first <unk> of particles that had done all the <unk> , <unk> , with a part of the <unk> , and <unk> particles inside the <unk> .
In other words , when you <unk> that picture the <unk> <unk> , you know , the car that the <unk> , which is a big <unk> .
I don 't know if it was this to make us more or that , when someone <unk> on Google and <unk> that the page was this .
That means that we 've had an impact <unk> beyond that .
<unk> a week later , there was a problem with the car , to just these <unk> <unk> here -- these <unk> <unk> .
These <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> when the car works at the <unk> <unk> .
Now , the <unk> of you <unk> the <unk> and <unk> , " It 's not true . They 're too <unk> . "
And instead they can do it because when they 're very <unk> get the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
So , unless you <unk> degrees , at a temperature <unk> at the <unk> of space between stars , these <unk> can bring that <unk> .
And in one of the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> in the <unk> , there was a <unk> <unk> .
So the <unk> <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
This was the result .
Now , this is even <unk> if you think that these <unk> <unk> <unk> over 20 <unk> , and that 's <unk> about 30 <unk> .
They <unk> about 50 <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , what we did .
We <unk> them and <unk> .
Now they 're all <unk> to their <unk> .
<unk> the end of <unk> the <unk> will be again .
We <unk> it , and we try to get data to <unk> or <unk> , and so on our <unk> to discover what the universe <unk> that are the universe .
Now , of course , in a way , these <unk> <unk> <unk> the value of science and engineering engineering engineering <unk> . It 's easy to <unk> .
I think that it 's so hard , the fact that it 's <unk> to go beyond <unk> , I think that 's the value of things like <unk> .
I 'd like to end with the words of a <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> experiments of <unk> , his <unk> was Michael <unk> , " <unk> is <unk> . " He said , " It 's not going to be <unk> , " It 's not <unk> in nature , that there are no new <unk> , there are no new <unk> , that there are no new <unk> .
Thank you .
I want to start with <unk> to <unk> to <unk> to when , children , <unk> <unk> .
And as we were <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> , <unk> , actually , to think about and <unk> problems and <unk> <unk> relationships .
<unk> <unk> is <unk> <unk> to the way that we 're <unk> part of the world around us .
So , from <unk> <unk> by <unk> of our <unk> with <unk> objects , with my <unk> <unk> , and my <unk> <unk> , and my <unk> <unk> , I started <unk> : " And if we use a computer , instead of only <unk> <unk> as digital <unk> that only <unk> on a <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> information with both hands ,
and <unk> to our <unk> ?
The question was so interesting that I decided to explore the answer , building <unk> .
In a few words , a <unk> is a computer <unk> like a <unk> .
In a few words , a <unk> is a computer <unk> like a <unk> .
You can <unk> them with your hand , they can hear them , " <unk> " <unk> " their " <unk> " and they have a screen and a <unk> radio .
But <unk> , they 're <unk> objects , like <unk> , you can just <unk> <unk> .
<unk> are the <unk> of a new tools to <unk> information .
And as they become <unk> , <unk> of the movement , <unk> of the others , and as they get <unk> , <unk> of the other , how they get <unk> , we can explore and <unk> <unk> .
Let me start with some simple example .
This <unk> is <unk> to show you about the video : if you <unk> it in a direction , the video will be so , if you go to the other side , you can be <unk> on the other side , it 's going to show you a <unk> on the other side .
These <unk> <unk> are <unk> of others .
If you <unk> them , you get <unk> what they are around .
If they 're <unk> , they can <unk> it and they can <unk> a little bit .
If they 're <unk> , they can <unk> it and they can <unk> a little bit .
They also <unk> their movement and <unk> .
And we realized that one of the interesting <unk> of the <unk> was the <unk> to use <unk> <unk> on the data , for example , <unk> <unk> color as if it was a <unk> .
In this case , we have three <unk> <unk> like <unk> <unk> and I can <unk> to <unk> the color of the central , where it 's <unk> .
And I can <unk> it to <unk> the color in the central , where you 're <unk> .
If you get too much , we can <unk> a little bit of a place .
There are also <unk> possibilities , like <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , math and <unk> where people can try things things , and they <unk> the <unk> immediately .
Now I 'm ...
This is a <unk> sequence I do with a <unk> program .
Here we have a words here that is <unk> between <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> , at every <unk> , <unk> a letter <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , every <unk> , <unk> , at every <unk> letter , on every <unk> , and while I was <unk> <unk> , he <unk> on a <unk> .
Then , after about 30 seconds , you get a new <unk> to <unk> and you have a new <unk> to try .
Thank you .
So here 's the children <unk> in <unk> <unk> to the <unk> <unk> , I did so that I <unk> them , and I <unk> a video .
They 're very <unk> .
And one of the interesting things like this <unk> is that you don 't have to give people a lot of <unk> .
I just said , " <unk> of words , " and they know what to do .
So here 's other people who <unk> it .
This is our <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , there 's the right .
It just wanted to <unk> .
They were just <unk> , for him .
Now , this is a <unk> <unk> .
You have to build a <unk> <unk> . He 's <unk> .
It can <unk> new characters in the scene , <unk> their <unk> .
It can <unk> new characters in the scene , <unk> their <unk> .
So , this is doing out the sun .
<unk> : The sun is <unk> .
David <unk> : Now he 's brought a <unk> in the scene .
<unk> : The <unk> <unk> .
<unk> ! Yes !
So , <unk> <unk> and <unk> can <unk> the characters --
<unk> : <unk> !
-- I 'm going to tell you about your own story .
<unk> : <unk> !
<unk> : It 's a story with the final story with the open , and it can decide how to <unk> .
<unk> : It 's a story with the final story with the open , and it can decide how to <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> away , <unk> .
<unk> : The last example I have time I 'm going to show you is a recent <unk> , to <unk> and <unk> music .
It 's a recent tool that 's <unk> , <unk> <unk> music .
<unk> here from <unk> as a base , bottom and <unk> .
<unk> of these has four different <unk> , and you can choose what to use .
You can also <unk> these <unk> in a sequence from <unk> to <unk> .
And they just <unk> a <unk> sound and a sequence .
These are effects that you can control from the live , like <unk> and <unk> .
I 'm going to make it to a particular sound and then <unk> to <unk> .
And then there are the effects of how long time and <unk> , that <unk> to the entire sequence .
<unk> how it works .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Now , <unk> a <unk> line .
<unk> : <unk> . Now <unk> <unk> <unk> ...
<unk> : And now I 'm going to <unk> the <unk> to the <unk> , so I can control the effect of the live .
<unk> : <unk> : I can <unk> the entire sequence <unk> time on one side or another .
<unk> : And now , I 'm going to <unk> the bottom to give more <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> : I can <unk> the <unk> <unk> . "
So I don 't have to <unk> before , but I can <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> more or more <unk> .
And now , finally , I can <unk> the entire <unk> <unk> <unk> on the left <unk> .
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is to build new <unk> <unk> <unk> to how our brain work and body .
And today , I 've been time to show you one of the results of this path , and some <unk> that we try to get out of the lab .
And the idea that I want to <unk> is that 's <unk> this new generation of <unk> objects to <unk> with the <unk> media , that we want to <unk> information in our world in the way we want .
Thank you very much .
I don 't see the time to talk to all of you .
They 're a <unk> .
<unk> books is my <unk> , but it 's more than that , of course .
It 's also love and <unk> of my life .
And I don 't expect that to change .
But , I said , something particular happened in my life and my career , and that led me to <unk> the whole relationship with this work .
The particular thing is I <unk> wrote this book , this <unk> called " <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , " which , " <unk> , " which , " <unk> from my <unk> , for some reason to <unk> in the world and <unk> a big , <unk> <unk> .
And the result is that everywhere I 'm <unk> now , people <unk> me as if I was <unk> .
<unk> -- <unk> , <unk> !
I 'm going to go to <unk> and say , " You don 't fear that you don 't know more to do it ?
You don 't fear to keep writing for the whole life that could be able to create a book that would be <unk> to <unk> ? "
What can you get to someone ? "
It 's <unk> , you know .
But it could go worse , except to me that I remember over 20 years ago , when I was saying to say people -- a <unk> -- I wanted to be a <unk> .
I 'm going to go to the same <unk> <unk> .
And people say , " Don 't you know I don 't know to be able to successful ?
You don 't fear that the <unk> <unk> <unk> ?
You don 't fear to do this <unk> all of the life without <unk> .
So , you know .
The answer -- the short answer to all these questions is , " Yes . "
Yes , I fear of all those things .
I always fear .
And I fear of many other things that people don 't have to be <unk> .
Like <unk> and other things <unk> .
But , as I thought , what I thought and <unk> me is why ?
Is it <unk> ?
It 's <unk> that anybody who who <unk> <unk> to be <unk> by a job that you feel like .
But what 's so particular in the <unk> <unk> <unk> to <unk> health care about a <unk> health care in a way that other <unk> don 't do ?
How did my father , for example , he was a <unk> <unk> and I don 't remember one time in his 40 years of activity , he was asked , if she was afraid to be <unk> ?
It didn 't have -- that <unk> of <unk> John , how do you go ?
<unk> 't you that way , <unk> ?
<unk> , engineers like a group of <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
We <unk> , we have this <unk> , and not only <unk> but <unk> <unk> , all of these kinds of <unk> , we have this <unk> to be <unk> <unk> .
And they 're not going to be able to <unk> <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> that , only in the <unk> century , <unk> young and often to <unk> .
And the ones that don 't have <unk> to be really <unk> by their <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , before he died in the last <unk> said , " Every book , " <unk> my book <unk> me a little bit more extraordinary <unk> about the work of their lives .
But we don 't know that when you tell you , because we heard these things so long that somehow we 've been <unk> and <unk> the <unk> that creativity and <unk> are <unk> in some way , and that the art , at the end , <unk> always <unk> .
And the question I want to <unk> to all of this idea here today is : are you agree with this idea ?
So , it 's good for all this thing -- because it 's <unk> from a <unk> to me , it 's not good for this <unk> .
I think it 's <unk> .
And I think it 's <unk> , and I don 't want to <unk> it in the next century .
I think it 's better to <unk> our big <unk> to live .
And I certainly know that , in my case -- in my situation -- it would be very <unk> to start <unk> to the <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> in which I 'm in my career .
<unk> -- look at it , I 'm pretty young , I 'm kind of like , I 'm pretty young .
I still have about four <unk> of work in me .
And it 's very <unk> that anything that 's going to happen to be <unk> by the world like the work that <unk> after the last book .
<unk> <unk> , because we 're all <unk> <unk> , because we 're all <unk> here -- is <unk> that my greatest success is to my <unk> .
Oh , <unk> , thinking !
You know , this is the kind of <unk> thinking that leads a person to start <unk> <unk> to the nine in the morning and I don 't want to do it .
I love to continue doing this work that I love .
So , the question becomes , how ?
And so I think , after many <unk> , that the way to work to continue to write is that to create a <unk> <unk> , OK ?
I have to get a distance of security between me , which I 'm <unk> , and my natural <unk> on what <unk> <unk> <unk> . And as I was going to get <unk> . And as I was going to try to find other societies to see if you could have better ideas and see if you could have better ideas and see if you could have better ideas and see if you have better ideas and <unk>
about how to help people <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of creativity .
And that research led me to the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
<unk> because I went to <unk> and then <unk> back .
<unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> -- people don 't believe that creativity <unk> from men , OK ?
It <unk> that creativity was this <unk> spirit and <unk> to <unk> men from some <unk> <unk> and <unk> to <unk> .
<unk> <unk> these <unk> <unk> <unk> of creativity .
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> to have a <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> from <unk> .
<unk> were the same idea , but they <unk> that kind of spirit of the <unk> <unk> .
And that 's <unk> , because <unk> didn 't really really feel a <unk> was somebody who were particularly smart .
And I thought that a <unk> was this kind of <unk> <unk> that <unk> literally in the <unk> of a <unk> artist , a little <unk> like the <unk> <unk> , and that <unk> out of <unk> <unk> the work of the artist artist 's work to the artist 's work for the artist .
<unk> <unk> , that 's the distance I 'm talking about -- that <unk> <unk> that <unk> you from your <unk> .
And everybody <unk> that was like this , right ?
So , the <unk> artists were <unk> to <unk> things , like <unk> <unk> , right ?
If your work was <unk> , you didn 't get to <unk> the <unk> , everybody <unk> that was <unk> by this <unk> <unk> .
If your work <unk> , it wasn 't all <unk> your <unk> , right ?
Everybody <unk> that was your <unk> to be a <unk> .
And so people <unk> <unk> creativity , in <unk> for a long time .
Then the <unk> <unk> and <unk> all <unk> , and we <unk> this big idea ; we put the human <unk> on the universe above all the <unk> and the <unk> and <unk> and no longer <unk> space to <unk> .
This was the principle of <unk> <unk> and people who were <unk> to think that creativity is completely <unk> from the <unk> .
And for the first time in history , he <unk> to <unk> this or that artist as a <unk> rather than a person with <unk> .
And I have to <unk> , I think it was a big <unk> .
I think you 're going to ask somebody , a simple person to believe that it 's like a source , <unk> and <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , <unk> and <unk> and <unk> is a <unk> responsibility to <unk> to human <unk> .
It 's like <unk> someone to <unk> the sun .
<unk> and <unk> completely <unk> the <unk> and creates all these <unk> <unk> <unk> on the <unk> .
And I think it was this pressure to have <unk> artists in the <unk> 500 years .
And if that 's true , and I think that 's that question is , the question becomes , and right ?
Can we do that ?
<unk> to go back to a <unk> understanding of the relationship between human and <unk> <unk> .
Or maybe not .
Maybe we can 't spend 500 years of thinking about it in an <unk> talk .
And there 's probably people in the audience who are <unk> <unk> <unk> on the <unk> , <unk> , do that <unk> people <unk> <unk> to <unk> on their projects .
You probably don 't <unk> you all this thing .
But the question I 'd like to <unk> is -- why don 't you ?
Why don 't you <unk> that way ?
Because it makes a sense of anything that I 've ever heard to explain the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> process .
A process that , as anyone who ever <unk> to do something -- so , basically , everybody -- he knows , you know , you don 't <unk> <unk> .
And in fact , it can sometimes be completely <unk> .
I did this <unk> <unk> with the extraordinary <unk> <unk> <unk> , who has now 90 years , but it was a <unk> for the whole life , and he said that during his <unk> <unk> , <unk> out in the <unk> <unk> , <unk> out in the <unk> <unk> , <unk> out in the <unk> <unk> .
She said that it was like a <unk> <unk> air .
And she <unk> <unk> to her <unk> .
I <unk> it , because he did <unk> the land under its feet .
I was going to try to have one thing to do , and it was , words , " <unk> as a <unk> . "
And I <unk> to the home and was <unk> by this <unk> , and it wouldn 't have to do anything else that take a piece of paper and a <unk> enough <unk> , as I <unk> it , <unk> and <unk> <unk> on the page .
<unk> , sometimes I couldn 't get to be fast enough , so <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> without being able to get to home and she <unk> her through and she would <unk> to <unk> through and she would <unk> through the <unk> , looking for the <unk> , as he said , " another <unk> . "
Then there were those times -- this piece , never <unk> it -- there was never going to -- there was <unk> when was almost <unk> , OK ?
So , he was <unk> home and he was looking for for the card , and he <unk> her <unk> through , and he <unk> a <unk> just in the while he he was <unk> with the other hand and <unk> <unk> .
<unk> the <unk> from the tail and <unk> her body <unk> it on its body and the <unk> on the page .
And in these cases , the <unk> would be <unk> on the <unk> page and <unk> , but <unk> , the <unk> <unk> the last word to the first .
So when I <unk> it -- it 's <unk> , it 's <unk> to my <unk> process .
Not my <unk> process -- I 'm not a <unk> !
I 'm a <unk> , and my way to <unk> is ; I 'm going to <unk> every day and work and work and <unk> on the <unk> .
But even me in my <unk> , I <unk> against that thing , sometimes .
And I 'm <unk> that many of you <unk> it .
You know , even if the work and ideas , I <unk> <unk> from a source , I couldn 't <unk> it .
And what is this thing ?
And how can we <unk> it in a way we don 't lose your head , but , rather than it 's <unk> us ?
And I 'm just as much as I 'm <unk> <unk> <unk> , which I 've been <unk> <unk> , which I 've been doing different years ago for a <unk> .
And I was talking about this , and you know , <unk> , for the <unk> was the <unk> artist <unk> <unk> , trying to control , <unk> , <unk> these sort of <unk> <unk> <unk> .
But then he <unk> , he <unk> up , and one day while he was <unk> on a <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> it all over him .
I 'm going fast and everything of a <unk> <unk> this little <unk> of <unk> , which comes into its head as the <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , and you want to , you know , it 's wonderful , and <unk> , but he doesn 't know how to <unk> it .
It 's not a piece of paper , it has no <unk> .
So he starts to hear this sort of old <unk> grow in him , like , " I 'm going to lose , and I 'm going to <unk> , and I 'm going to <unk> it from this <unk> song .
I 'm not <unk> enough , and I can 't <unk> . "
And instead of going to <unk> , you <unk> .
<unk> the whole process of <unk> and did something completely new .
I just <unk> the sky and said , " <unk> , don 't you see I 'm <unk> ? "
" It seems to you write a song now ? "
If you really want to <unk> , you 're going to take care of you .
<unk> , <unk> to <unk> something else today .
<unk> <unk> <unk> . "
And his <unk> process after this .
Not the work , the work was still <unk> as always .
But the process , and the <unk> <unk> that <unk> was <unk> when he <unk> the <unk> , the <unk> that <unk> out of him , he <unk> , he <unk> , he <unk> , he <unk> that he had not to be a <unk> thing and <unk> .
But I <unk> this <unk> , wonderful <unk> , <unk> , a conversation , and this <unk> thing , and <unk> , but it wasn 't <unk> .
So , as I <unk> that story to change a little bit , the way I 'm <unk> and already <unk> me once .
This idea , I was when I was <unk> , " <unk> , <unk> , " and I <unk> , " and I go into one of the <unk> that we 're all working on something , and we don 't get you start to think that it 's going to be a <unk> , that will be the <unk> book .
Not just <unk> , the <unk> .
And I started thinking about <unk> this project .
But then I 'm <unk> to <unk> that I <unk> into the air and <unk> .
So I <unk> my face on the <unk> and I <unk> my <unk> to a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And I said , " <unk> , what , both we know that if this book is not going to be <unk> my , isn 't it ?
Because as you see I 'm <unk> everything I have , I don 't have more of this .
So if you want it to be better , you have to <unk> and do your side .
Okay . But if you don 't do that , you know , I don 't do it .
I started writing the same because it 's my work .
And I 'd like you to <unk> that it was <unk> that I 've been <unk> to do my part " Because -- finally , OK -- <unk> does it in the <unk> of Africa 's North Africa 's people <unk> to <unk> for the <unk> to the clear moon , music that I 'm going to be <unk> to <unk> hours to <unk> .
And they were always <unk> , because the <unk> were <unk> and they were <unk> .
But every once in a while , I <unk> , something <unk> , and one of these <unk> artists actually <unk> .
And I know you know what I talk about , because I know you 've all seen , at a point , a <unk> like that .
It was like the time , and the <unk> <unk> through a kind of <unk> and it wasn 't doing anything different from the <unk> , like the <unk> <unk> first , but it was all <unk> .
And suddenly , it doesn 't just <unk> as a human .
But it <unk> out of the <unk> and <unk> in the fire of the <unk> .
And when you <unk> this <unk> , at the time , people know what was , they <unk> with his name .
<unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> , " <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , God , God , God , God , God . "
That 's God , you know .
<unk> <unk> -- when the <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> of <unk> , I <unk> this <unk> with them and <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , " <unk> , " which you can hear in the <unk> or <unk> .
In <unk> , when a artist has done something impossible and <unk> , " <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> -- a <unk> of God .
And it 's <unk> because we need it .
But , the problem comes after day , for the <unk> itself , when you <unk> and <unk> that are 11 <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> . <unk> there is no more .
It 's just a <unk> with great <unk> to <unk> , and maybe never <unk> to <unk> it .
And maybe nobody <unk> the name of God still <unk> , while he 's <unk> , and what he has to do with the rest of his life ?
It 's hard .
This is one of the most <unk> <unk> to do in a <unk> life .
But maybe it 's not to be that <unk> if you don 't believe , <unk> , <unk> the most <unk> <unk> in your being being being being being being being <unk> .
But let me just <unk> that you get <unk> from a <unk> source of this <unk> part of your life that you have to <unk> .
And , you know , if we think it 's all the way .
And so I started to <unk> , and it 's certainly how I <unk> it for several months during the <unk> <unk> that I would soon be , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> of my success .
And what I have to continue <unk> when I feel <unk> from this is , not <unk> .
You don 't <unk> . You just get your work .
<unk> to <unk> for your side , whatever it can be .
If your work is <unk> , <unk> .
If the <unk> , you 're going to <unk> you would <unk> to <unk> you would <unk> some kind of <unk> , for one moment through your <unk> , " <unk> ! "
<unk> , you make the same <unk> your <unk> .
And " <unk> ! " to you .
I think , I think , you know , I think , you know ,
" <unk> ! " <unk> ! "
Thank you .
Thank you .
<unk> <unk> : <unk> !
As you know , you 've already talked about some of these projects on the human genome , what can happen and the discovery of new genes .
Now we 're <unk> a new way . We started to <unk> biology and now starting to <unk> biology and now starting from that digital code , we 're <unk> in a new <unk> <unk> and <unk> life .
We always tried to ask <unk> big questions .
" What is life ? " It 's something that many <unk> , I think have <unk> to different levels .
We 've tried <unk> , <unk> to the <unk> terms .
We 're <unk> for almost 20 years .
When we <unk> the human genome is to go through the world , <unk> biology in the world of the digital world .
Now , <unk> us : can we <unk> life , or create new life from this digital universe ?
This is a map of a little <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , which is the species from the <unk> genome between the the <unk> genome between the the <unk> that can be in the lab .
And we tried to reduce the genome to <unk> a little bit more small .
We 're able to <unk> a <unk> of the genes about 500 that are here .
But when you look at its <unk> map , it 's <unk> simple than our .
<unk> , that 's simple .
But when we look at all the genes that we can <unk> , one at the time , it 's very <unk> that this can bring a <unk> cell .
So I thought the only way to <unk> was <unk> this <unk> so that they <unk> <unk> to <unk> some of these questions .
And so we started the <unk> of " Can we get a <unk> ? "
Can the chemistry to produce these big molecules that we 've never been able to do before creating the <unk> before ?
And , in case , can we make a <unk> ?
A <unk> is just a piece of <unk> material .
The speed with which we 're able to <unk> life is <unk> to <unk> <unk> .
Our ability to write the code , instead of <unk> , but it 's <unk> .
And our <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
We 've been over 15 years ago .
The process has <unk> a lot of <unk> , <unk> with a <unk> <unk> before <unk> experiments .
But we found that DNA <unk> is very difficult .
There are <unk> of thousands of cars in the world that <unk> little <unk> of DNA , the <unk> of 30 to 50 <unk> and it 's a <unk> process . <unk> the longer are <unk> .
So we had to develop a new way to <unk> these <unk> and <unk> the <unk> .
And this was our first <unk> , from digital information of <unk> genome <unk> <unk> .
It 's a little virus that bacteria can <unk> .
We 've designed <unk> , we <unk> the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> a DNA <unk> about about <unk> <unk> .
The interesting part is when we took this piece of <unk> material , and we <unk> it in bacteria , the bacteria have <unk> to read this code , and <unk> particles .
The <unk> particles have been <unk> by cells , are <unk> back , and they <unk> <unk> <unk> .
I talked about recent members of the <unk> industry that they have certainly <unk> this model .
They <unk> over over over you .
And I think that 's a situation where software can actually build its own <unk> in a <unk> system .
But we wanted to do the bigger things .
They wanted to build the entire <unk> <unk> .
They 're more than <unk> <unk> code .
So we thought about <unk> in the size of the virus , so that we can change the <unk> to understand what the <unk> are the <unk> of a <unk> cell .
<unk> is <unk> , and if you <unk> information with a computer , these must be very <unk> .
When I first <unk> this genome for the first time in <unk> , the standard <unk> was a <unk> for every 10 <unk> <unk> .
We found , <unk> , <unk> <unk> . If you used that original sequence , we will never be able to do it .
One part of the process is to design <unk> 50 <unk> that <unk> with all the other <unk> <unk> to build smaller <unk> that <unk> together .
<unk> elements here .
You probably read that <unk> us in the <unk> .
So , we have a <unk> code that we have a <unk> <unk> on four <unk> : A , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> of those <unk> <unk> together , <unk> about 20 <unk> , and there 's a <unk> order to <unk> every <unk> .
So we can use the code to write words , <unk> , <unk> .
What we did at the beginning was <unk> .
Some of them were <unk> by the fact that it wasn 't <unk> .
We 've designed these <unk> to just <unk> with <unk> .
There are <unk> that <unk> them and <unk> them .
And we started to <unk> parts , <unk> with <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> to seven <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> to <unk> them to <unk> <unk> .
But every step we 've produced these <unk> <unk> so that we 're <unk> to create an extremely <unk> <unk> , because we 're <unk> to create an extremely <unk> <unk> .
We 're trying to <unk> the process .
So , this looks like the <unk> of a <unk> <unk> .
When you get to these <unk> <unk> , a lot of <unk> , more than 100 <unk> , you don 't get to directly into the <unk> .
You get to the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> biology .
So we 've <unk> other <unk> .
<unk> of another <unk> called <unk> , which in biology , <unk> <unk> to <unk> DNA that can <unk> <unk> .
Here 's an example .
This <unk> , called <unk> , can <unk> three million <unk> <unk> .
You can see in the <unk> <unk> like its <unk> is <unk> .
<unk> -- 12 hours it 's been <unk> exactly like it was first .
<unk> thousands of organisms that can do that .
These organisms can be completely <unk> .
You have to live under <unk> .
I 'm absolutely sure that life <unk> in space , and they 're <unk> to find new <unk> of water .
And actually , NASA showed that this is .
This is an image of the <unk> that we 've built these <unk> , just using these <unk> , just using these <unk> <unk> design <unk> .
<unk> <unk> them <unk> .
This picture was not <unk> with a <unk> <unk> , but with a <unk> <unk> .
It 's such a big <unk> that we can <unk> with a <unk> <unk> .
These are pictures that <unk> a time of about six seconds .
This is the <unk> that we 've done a little time ago .
They 're more than <unk> code .
It 's the largest <unk> of a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> by man .
It has a <unk> weight <unk> to 300 million .
If you <unk> it with a <unk> <unk> , you will be <unk> pages to <unk> this code .
Now , how do we make it work ? How can we <unk> ?
Of course , a virus is a <unk> .
It 's a little bit more <unk> when you use of the bacteria .
It 's <unk> cells as well as when it comes to the <unk> cells like our : you just <unk> the <unk> and <unk> another , which is that almost the process of <unk> .
In <unk> <unk> , the <unk> is <unk> in the cell , but we <unk> <unk> that we are able to make a <unk> <unk> of a cell to another cell <unk> .
We <unk> a <unk> <unk> from a species .
<unk> are different as the men from <unk> .
We 've <unk> some <unk> <unk> in a way that we could decide which to choose what to do for this <unk> .
And then he <unk> it with the <unk> so that we <unk> all the <unk> .
And when we put it in the cell , it was <unk> , and we <unk> our <unk> the new <unk> went into the cell .
And <unk> <unk> that we don 't want to go beyond , but we tried to <unk> more <unk> in there .
This is one of the major <unk> of evolution .
We discovered that <unk> species <unk> a second or a third <unk> , <unk> somewhere , <unk> in a second thousands of new <unk> to that species .
So who thinks about evolution as a <unk> only <unk> at the time you <unk> has no <unk> of biology .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> that was in the cell didn 't <unk> one .
The <unk> <unk> that we <unk> <unk> .
It 's <unk> , and it has <unk> the other <unk> as a <unk> , has <unk> it , and we <unk> with only cell , and the new <unk> .
It 's become blue because of the genes that we 've <unk> .
And in a short <unk> of time , all the <unk> of a species are <unk> , and it 's <unk> all over a new species , <unk> on the new software that we <unk> in the cell .
All the <unk> are <unk> , the <unk> are <unk> , and when you <unk> the code , they <unk> exactly what we 've <unk> .
Now , this could be <unk> <unk> , but <unk> the software we can change things in a pretty <unk> way .
Now , I <unk> that 's not about <unk> -- but from progress from three million years and a half million years from <unk> and evolution , and I said that maybe we 're going to create a new version of <unk> <unk> that we can <unk> new species on this digital process .
Why do that ?
I think it 's pretty <unk> when we think about our <unk> .
We 're going to go from six billion and a half billion people to <unk> billion in the next 40 years .
Right to give an example : I was born in <unk> .
Now , there are three people on the planet to <unk> in <unk> ; there 's going to be four .
We 're <unk> now to find food , water , <unk> water and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , six and a half billion people .
I 'm going to get to do it for nine billion .
<unk> more than five billion <unk> , over 30 billion <unk> .
That means 100 million <unk> a day .
When we try to find <unk> <unk> , or any kind of process to <unk> , it will be a huge challenge .
In more we have to realize that all of CO2 <unk> from these materials that <unk> in the atmosphere .
At the day , because of the <unk> <unk> around the world , we have a <unk> with about 20 million genes , and I like to think that are the <unk> <unk> for the future .
The industry is only about a <unk> about <unk> , and you think about how many different things are <unk> out .
Our <unk> here are <unk> data from the <unk> reality and our imagination .
Now we have <unk> , <unk> to these <unk> <unk> <unk> , able to create what we call what we call <unk> <unk> .
We 're able to build a big robot that can produce a million <unk> a day .
Think of <unk> these 20 million different genes or try to <unk> the <unk> to produce <unk> or <unk> , new <unk> , we can change , because of a small team , and create more <unk> biology now that in the last 20 years of science .
And it 's just a standard <unk> .
We can choose to <unk> , <unk> chemistry or <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
This is a <unk> of some software <unk> that we 're working on to be able to <unk> and design species to computers .
Well , we don 't know what they 're going to be .
We know exactly what their <unk> code is .
Now we 're <unk> on the <unk> generation .
You 've also seen that <unk> from the <unk> was a finished experiment .
We 've <unk> second and third generation that we 're going to <unk> enough to <unk> <unk> <unk> like <unk> or different kinds of <unk> .
But the only way that biology can have a big impact without <unk> to <unk> the food cost of food and <unk> the <unk> would be <unk> CO2 as much as we 're working on to design that can achieve this purpose , and we can think that we can have the first <unk> <unk> in about 18 months .
<unk> light <unk> with CO2 is a <unk> , but in our <unk> <unk> , we found different <unk> .
This is a <unk> that we <unk> in the <unk> .
It 's about <unk> feet deep to the temperature of <unk> to water .
They 're <unk> by CO2 using hydrogen <unk> as the source of energy .
We 're trying to understand whether we can <unk> CO2 , which can easily be <unk> by <unk> , <unk> that CO2 in <unk> , to drive this process .
So <unk> we think that we could be able to <unk> what the basic question that the basic question that what is life is , we , we have the <unk> goal to <unk> the whole industry .
<unk> . If you can 't do it from TED , where can you ?
<unk> a main source of energy .
And we 're working on to use the same <unk> to create <unk> .
You 've seen this year with the flu , we always go back to a year and with a dollar in less when it comes to find the right .
I think that 's going to be building <unk> <unk> in <unk> .
That 's how the future could start to look <unk> , now , the tree of evolution , <unk> evolution with bacteria , <unk> , <unk> , and finally cells <unk> .
We 're in so <unk> to <unk> people .
Our purpose is to make a <unk> to make a long enough to try to <unk> . Thank you very much .
<unk> I 'm going to show you , the <unk> possible , some fundamental work , some of the new technology that we 've <unk> to <unk> <unk> to a year ago . This is <unk> .
It 's a environment that you can <unk> both at the local level that <unk> with a huge amount of data .
Here we 're seeing <unk> <unk> <unk> with a kind of <unk> <unk> and <unk> , for a quick <unk> , <unk> , <unk> images as we want .
And no matter how big the amount of information that we see , how big it is these <unk> of data or <unk> .
Most of them are common pictures , but this is a <unk> <unk> from the <unk> of the <unk> , and <unk> in the <unk> .
It 's not any difference because the only thing that <unk> <unk> the <unk> of a system like this is the number of <unk> on your screen at any time . It 's also a very <unk> architecture .
This is a whole book , example of data not images .
This is the <unk> <unk> <unk> . Every <unk> is a <unk> .
And to <unk> that 's just about this , and not <unk> of images , we can do something like that , to actually see it 's a real <unk> of the text , not a picture .
It could be a little <unk> to read a little <unk> .
I don 't <unk> it .
This is an <unk> example . It 's a <unk> example . It 's a number of The <unk> .
Every big image is the beginning of a <unk> .
And it really gives you the pleasure and beautiful experience of reading the real version of a <unk> or a <unk> , which is for nature a <unk> kind of a <unk> .
We also did something with the corner of the <unk> number in particular <unk> .
We created a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , much higher than you use in a normal <unk> , and we 've <unk> you <unk> the <unk> content .
If you want to see the <unk> of this <unk> , you can see here .
Or other models , or even <unk> <unk> .
And this really <unk> some of these ideas to <unk> the <unk> of space on the screen .
And I 'm going to show that <unk> to <unk> and other <unk> like that , you don 't have to be <unk> .
Of course , <unk> is one of the most <unk> <unk> for this kind of technology .
And I don 't want to lose time , if not to say that we have <unk> to give us <unk> to <unk> in this field .
These are all the streets <unk> on a NASA <unk> picture .
So now we 're going to go to something else .
This is actually live in the Web ; you can see it .
It 's a project called <unk> , which <unk> two different technologies .
One is <unk> and the other is a very interesting research that has been done by <unk> <unk> , a <unk> student of Washington , with the <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> . A <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And it 's alive on the Web , <unk> by <unk> .
You can <unk> when we do this kind of <unk> , where we can go from a picture to another , and you can get this kind of experience .
But the <unk> <unk> of the images here actually has a meaning .
The <unk> of the computer <unk> have <unk> these images together , so that they <unk> to the places that are <unk> <unk> <unk> in which <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> on the <unk> <unk> have been <unk> . Here you see some <unk> <unk> , or <unk> <unk> , these things were <unk> at the <unk> level .
I don 't know if I 've got time to show you some other environment .
There are a lot more <unk> .
I want to spend directly directly to one of the <unk> of <unk> data , and this <unk> from a <unk> <unk> that we 've done to work for the first time , to show you what 's really <unk> is the key behind this technology , <unk> technology . And it 's not <unk> looking for so <unk> that we 've put in the website .
We had to <unk> some <unk> and so on .
This is a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> images from <unk> . <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> and <unk> and <unk> images of types in <unk> , other <unk> and so forth . You can see these <unk> <unk> , there 's a picture that 's discovery .
So they 're all <unk> images and they 're all <unk> <unk> <unk> and they 're all <unk> at the same level .
And it 's possible to <unk> this <unk> way .
You know , I would never thought of end up to work to <unk> .
It 's very <unk> to <unk> this kind of <unk> here .
I think you can see that it 's a lot of different kinds of <unk> : from those <unk> to <unk> <unk> , a <unk> number , <unk> . <unk> number , <unk> <unk> in this environment .
And if I can , I can , I try and , I can try and , I can try and , and if I can , I can , <unk> to look for the <unk> .
Many are <unk> by <unk> , etc .
There 's a series of pictures here -- <unk> .
This is a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
We can go from <unk> to <unk> physics of this environment .
The <unk> is that we can do things with social environment . This is now <unk> data from the whole memory of how we <unk> the earth , from the point of view , <unk> , from the point of view and <unk> all that data together .
All those pictures become <unk> together , the greater than the <unk> .
You have a <unk> model of the whole <unk> model .
Think about this as the <unk> of the work of <unk> <unk> on Earth .
It 's something that <unk> in <unk> complexity that people are <unk> , and which <unk> for who are <unk> with the use .
Their pictures are <unk> with <unk> <unk> by other people .
If somebody else is the idea of <unk> all these <unk> <unk> , my picture of <unk> <unk> <unk> , my picture of <unk> <unk> <unk> , you know , and I can use it as a <unk> <unk> to <unk> in that space , in that <unk> , using the pictures of anyone else , and have a social experience .
Of course , a <unk> of this is very , very <unk> models of every interesting part of the earth , <unk> not just to <unk> <unk> and <unk> images and <unk> and <unk> , but from <unk> memory .
Thank you very much .
Chris Anderson : I understand ? What 's your software ? What your software will be doing is that at some point in the next few years , all the photographs that are all going to be <unk> together ?
<unk> : Yes . What 's doing is it 's basically discover .
It 's creating <unk> , if you want , between images .
And it 's <unk> it 's <unk> .
And the thing becomes very interesting if you think about the <unk> of <unk> information that many of these <unk> images .
As a <unk> is a <unk> <unk> and the text , you <unk> a <unk> and the text on the page has a lot of information about images .
Now , what happens if that picture is going on on all your pictures ?
So , the amount of <unk> <unk> and the amount of <unk> that <unk> is really huge . It 's a <unk> effect .
CA : <unk> , it 's really incredible .
<unk> : I 'm going to tell you a lot .
One of the major <unk> when you <unk> and one of the <unk> research is to be able to live in the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , who <unk> the past in the wind , the <unk> <unk> <unk> from the <unk> , the <unk> <unk> of plants .
You think that <unk> <unk> <unk> still <unk> <unk> , or that the <unk> of <unk> <unk> are still <unk> <unk> <unk> are still <unk> <unk> <unk> , or that <unk> , <unk> <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> , to <unk> the <unk> of <unk> , and that the idea that the world we live in in which , is not <unk> sense , but only a model of reality ,
the <unk> of a particular <unk> of <unk> choices that our <unk> has done , good or evil , many <unk> .
And , of course , we 're all <unk> <unk> .
Everybody <unk> . Everybody <unk> .
We 're <unk> to <unk> <unk> .
We have to deal with the <unk> of death , so we don 't <unk> that if you <unk> and <unk> --
We all have an art .
What <unk> is the <unk> particular <unk> of the song , the <unk> of every culture .
It doesn 't matter that matter the <unk> <unk> of <unk> , or the <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> , or the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , or the <unk> <unk> <unk> , or a <unk> in the heart of the <unk> .
He was my <unk> journey in the <unk> a month ago , or a <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> , on the world 's <unk> .
All of these <unk> <unk> that there are other ways of <unk> other ways of thinking , other ways of moving around the world .
And , if you look a moment , it 's a concept that can give you hope .
<unk> , the <unk> of the world create a <unk> of <unk> life and <unk> that <unk> the planet and it 's important to the <unk> of the planet as the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And you can think about this <unk> <unk> as a <unk> and you can <unk> the <unk> of all the <unk> , dreams , <unk> , <unk> , ideas , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> in being by the <unk> imagination .
<unk> is the fantastic <unk> of humanity .
It 's the <unk> of what we 're and what we can be as as <unk> .
And <unk> <unk> was <unk> <unk> <unk> was successful at <unk> and <unk> very <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , for example , <unk> that 50 percent of all species has been or is on the <unk> of <unk> , because it 's <unk> , or -- in the <unk> <unk> -- in the field of the <unk> diversity -- and you don 't even even <unk> <unk> -- the <unk> diversity .
The <unk> of this is , of course , the <unk> <unk> .
When you 're <unk> <unk> <unk> on this planet .
A language is not just <unk> by a <unk> or a series of rules .
A language is the <unk> of the spirit .
It 's the <unk> that the <unk> of every culture comes in the material world .
Every language is a forest of mind , a <unk> , a thought , a <unk> of <unk> .
And those <unk> <unk> , while we 're sitting here in <unk> , at least half is no longer being <unk> in the <unk> of children .
It 's not <unk> to children , which means not to <unk> that you don 't understand something , which are dead .
What 's more <unk> than being <unk> by the <unk> , the <unk> of being the last last to talk about a language , not to <unk> the <unk> of <unk> or <unk> <unk> ?
This <unk> <unk> was the state of somebody in some world every two weeks : every two weeks , a <unk> <unk> and <unk> with itself in the <unk> <unk> language .
And I know some of you know , " <unk> 't you know that , " <unk> 't you do it ?
The world wouldn 't be a better place if you all know the same language ? " So , then we 're all <unk> .
<unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> what it means not to be able to talk about their own language .
I 'd like to make you today to make a journey through the <unk> --
a little journey in the <unk> to give you a <unk> of what we 're <unk> .
Many of us <unk> that when I say " different ways of <unk> . " I mean , " I really mean different ways of <unk> .
<unk> for example this <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , the <unk> of <unk> , which <unk> to the <unk> <unk> from the <unk> <unk> from the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
It 's a <unk> that 's not able to <unk> the blue color from green because the green <unk> because the <unk> is <unk> in the forest , which we <unk> the <unk> .
They have a <unk> language and a <unk> rule , " <unk> <unk> " : you have to <unk> a person talking about a different language .
All of that has been <unk> in the past <unk> , the <unk> is that in these <unk> families that you 're talking six or seven <unk> because of <unk> <unk> <unk> nobody 's .
They <unk> to hear and then <unk> talk to .
<unk> one of the most interesting <unk> I lived with , the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , an incredible <unk> that had the first <unk> in <unk> .
In <unk> , I got a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
They did <unk> by the top pictures that <unk> them in <unk> that <unk> <unk> , <unk> that this <unk> forest <unk> had never seen anything .
They <unk> the <unk> pictures , they have <unk> to <unk> a form or a <unk> , not <unk> . They have <unk> that <unk> <unk> , and they <unk> the five <unk> with the <unk> .
But <unk> not only <unk> <unk> .
They <unk> themselves .
<unk> percent of <unk> was <unk> by themselves .
We 're <unk> to eight <unk> and found two <unk> cases , and when we <unk> to know , they <unk> that one of them was <unk> so that he died , and then they <unk> it itself . And then they <unk> it . But anyway , they had an incredible knowledge of the forest .
<unk> were able to recognize the animal <unk> from 40 <unk> and <unk> the species .
<unk> <unk> , I was <unk> a really interesting job when my <unk> <unk> <unk> me , if I wanted to go to <unk> in <unk> society , at the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
To make sense of <unk> , I should have understand <unk> culture , and that <unk> is not <unk> <unk> .
It 's pretty much of a <unk> view of the world .
Very interesting .
If you ask to <unk> the big <unk> of the world , what would you like ?
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , etc .
A continent comes out , thinking about thinking that <unk> Africa has no <unk> . And instead and yes and <unk> , it 's not the <unk> of these <unk> <unk> <unk> .
What makes the <unk> of <unk> is the <unk> relationship between life and death .
So <unk> are <unk> <unk> .
<unk> can be <unk> by the <unk> <unk> , <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> and <unk> <unk> to the <unk> of the live in such such a short moment , the <unk> becomes the <unk> .
So , for <unk> <unk> to say , " <unk> go to <unk> to talk about God .
We <unk> in <unk> and <unk> God . "
And from the time that you 're <unk> , is the spirit that <unk> you can make you bad ?
So , you 're <unk> to these incredible events : <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a pretty <unk> of the power of the body , when it 's <unk> in a state of <unk> <unk> .
<unk> all the <unk> that I lived with the <unk> I lived with the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , in the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> of <unk> civilization , which once <unk> on the <unk> <unk> of <unk> in <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> on the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
In a <unk> continent , this <unk> has never been <unk> by <unk> .
And I 'm <unk> today , I 'm <unk> by a <unk> , but their <unk> is extraordinary .
<unk> <unk> are <unk> by <unk> to the <unk> families from three or four years , and they live in a world that they 're <unk> to <unk> <unk> for 18 years .
Two <unk> years old <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
For that time , they 're <unk> to values that <unk> their own <unk> , <unk> that <unk> their <unk> and only their <unk> <unk> <unk> -- or to say the <unk> <unk> .
And then the <unk> of this incredible <unk> , they get <unk> out and the first time in their life , at the age of 18 , see an <unk> . And in that moment of the first <unk> <unk> , when the sun <unk> <unk> , everything they have been <unk> in theory is <unk> all the <unk> in the theory is <unk> in its <unk> . <unk> makes a <unk> <unk> , and he says .
" <unk> ? <unk> as I told you .
It 's <unk> . Now it 's now <unk> to you . "
They 're in <unk> and they say that we , <unk> <unk> , we are the <unk> of the world .
This level of <unk> is extremely important .
When we think about the <unk> <unk> and the <unk> environment , and the old history of <unk> <unk> , which is a <unk> concept in its <unk> or maybe <unk> <unk> and say that these <unk> are <unk> <unk> to the Earth of us .
<unk> <unk> are not <unk> or <unk> by <unk> .
There 's no space for these things in the <unk> <unk> of <unk> or <unk> <unk> , but because of time and <unk> , they created a <unk> <unk> of the Earth <unk> not to the <unk> <unk> <unk> , but on a <unk> <unk> , the concept that the Earth can live only because it 's <unk> by the human consciousness of the <unk> .
What does it mean ?
And I mean that a <unk> of the <unk> that <unk> <unk> the mountain is a <unk> spirit that <unk> its <unk> will be a human being <unk> different human being . And it 's going to be a very different relationship with the mountain or that place , a <unk> <unk> of <unk> that <unk> <unk> a mountain , a <unk> <unk> to be <unk> .
which is a <unk> of a spirit or a <unk> <unk> is <unk> .
What 's interesting is the <unk> that <unk> the relationship between <unk> and the natural world .
I grew up in the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> to be <unk> .
And that made me a human being different from my <unk> friends who believe that <unk> are the <unk> of <unk> and the <unk> <unk> and the <unk> <unk> that live in the world 's <unk> , <unk> that live in the world , <unk> that are <unk> in the world , <unk> that they <unk> during the <unk> <unk> .
If you start <unk> that these <unk> can make different , we start to understand some of their <unk> <unk> . They start to understand this <unk> .
I took this picture to <unk> in the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> some of you have heard about <unk> , the most powerful <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> .
And what makes <unk> is not the <unk> potential of <unk> , but his <unk> . It 's <unk> by two elements .
On one hand , this <unk> <unk> that has a series of <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , <unk> .
<unk> only has a <unk> <unk> a little <unk> , which <unk> a little bit , but it 's <unk> with the <unk> of a family <unk> said <unk> .
This <unk> has <unk> <unk> , very similar to <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
If you ever see the <unk> <unk> <unk> on the <unk> , the <unk> that are doing from a different <unk> of species , it has <unk> .
<unk> that <unk> on the <unk> is a little bit like being <unk> by a <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> on a sea of electricity .
I often <unk> with my <unk> , Richard <unk> <unk> , the man who <unk> was <unk> , with his discovery of the <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> .
And my <unk> can 't be <unk> these <unk> as a <unk> because if you did not tell anybody to be <unk> . <unk> <unk> can 't be <unk> because they 're <unk> by a <unk> that is , of course in <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
It 's possible to <unk> <unk> only if you could <unk> with other <unk> <unk> that <unk> .
Now , it 's the <unk> that are in this <unk> are <unk> <unk> , the same kind of <unk> to <unk> the <unk> . The question <unk> <unk> is , in a <unk> of <unk> species , like these <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> species , like these <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , they make a <unk> version that 's <unk> <unk> to the <unk> of the parts ?
We use the big <unk> of evidence and <unk> , which can <unk> .
But if you go to the <unk> , we 'll be " The plants talk . "
What does it mean ?
This <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in the forest , and that <unk> <unk> in the forest , and our eyes <unk> in the same species .
If you <unk> how to <unk> their <unk> , you know , " I 'm going to talk , " I said , " No , "
The solution is : You take the <unk> <unk> in a night moon at a <unk> and <unk> with a different <unk> .
And you don 't get <unk> to <unk> , but it 's much more interesting than <unk> <unk> .
Now , [ <unk> ] the problem is that even those of us who have to the heart <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> them , but somehow <unk> to the <unk> of history of the <unk> of the world , <unk> <unk> .
In fact , the <unk> century , in 300 years , not <unk> <unk> for its <unk> or its <unk> <unk> , but rather as the <unk> was where we <unk> and <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> diversity and <unk> and <unk> on the planet on the planet . Now the problem is not the change .
All <unk> through the <unk> have been <unk> in a <unk> for new possibility of life .
And the problem is not technology .
<unk> <unk> don 't have <unk> to be <unk> when they put <unk> <unk> and <unk> like the <unk> have no <unk> to be when they <unk> don 't <unk> to be <unk> when they put out <unk> and <unk> .
It 's not the change or technology that <unk> the <unk> of <unk> . It 's the power .
The <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And if you look at the world , you know , you know , you know , you know , you can 't <unk> them .
They 're <unk> creatures and <unk> <unk> out of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> .
And I think it 's <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> --
a <unk> <unk> <unk> , in the <unk> <unk> , a <unk> that has been <unk> in the forest to a generation <unk> to a generation of <unk> , where you can see the <unk> <unk> from the <unk> <unk> , where you can see the <unk> <unk> from the <unk> seems to <unk> <unk> , where the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , where the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , where the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> ,
I started to <unk> the <unk> with the <unk> <unk> to the forest .
Or , in the case of <unk> , are the diseases that are <unk> with the discovery of <unk> .
If you <unk> on the <unk> , where I 'm doing a lot of research , you 'll see the <unk> <unk> of politics .
As a <unk> , <unk> physics of a <unk> , is <unk> to the <unk> level , but <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> .
And you can 't understand the <unk> of the <unk> until you start .
I <unk> miles from <unk> to <unk> China through the <unk> <unk> , <unk> to <unk> with a young <unk> , but only <unk> <unk> to <unk> with a young <unk> , but only <unk> <unk> to <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> million people from the <unk> during the <unk> <unk> .
And the father of this guy was <unk> to the <unk> <unk> .
And that means that it was <unk> at the time of Chinese <unk> .
<unk> <unk> is <unk> with <unk> <unk> during the <unk> that led the <unk> <unk> .
My mother was <unk> and his <unk> was being <unk> .
It was taken of <unk> in <unk> at the age of two years old <unk> under its <unk> because it couldn 't have been able to live without him .
<unk> , which has done the same , was <unk> in <unk> field .
One day he <unk> a <unk> <unk> , and , for this <unk> , it was <unk> to the work <unk> for seven years .
The <unk> of <unk> can be <unk> , but the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> is from the present .
And then , it 's all <unk> to a choice .
Do you live in the <unk> world of <unk> or want to <unk> the world of diversity ?
The big <unk> <unk> <unk> , before he died said that his greatest fear was that , in our <unk> to go to this <unk> <unk> <unk> of human imagination to a <unk> <unk> of human imagination to a <unk> <unk> of human thinking , but a day we <unk> from a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that there were other possibility .
And it 's <unk> to remember that our species is <unk> for <unk> years .
The <unk> <unk> , which gave us <unk> to the <unk> of <unk> , <unk> the <unk> <unk> with the <unk> of the <unk> with the <unk> of the <unk> with the <unk> of <unk> , creating the <unk> of <unk> , and we talk about <unk> years ago .
The <unk> world has been <unk> 300 years .
That <unk> story doesn 't <unk> me that we have answers to all the challenges that we can face in the <unk> to come .
When these <unk> <unk> <unk> of the world is asked what it means to be human , <unk> with <unk> different <unk> .
And it 's in these answers that we all <unk> the ability to be what we are , a <unk> species , which has to <unk> the <unk> and all the <unk> can <unk> . And there are great moments of <unk> .
I <unk> this picture on the north of <unk> , when I went to <unk> <unk> with <unk> , and this man , <unk> me the wonderful story of <unk> .
The government <unk> was not always <unk> with the <unk> <unk> and in the <unk> to <unk> our <unk> , we <unk> them into <unk> .
The <unk> of this man <unk> <unk> .
<unk> family , <unk> for his life , <unk> <unk> all the <unk> , and all his <unk> .
You want to know that <unk> doesn 't <unk> the cold , <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> were made of fish <unk> in skin of <unk> .
The <unk> of this man didn 't <unk> <unk> from night or <unk> .
It 's <unk> , it <unk> the <unk> in skin of <unk> and <unk> in your hand . When I did it , I <unk> it by making it , he <unk> them by making a <unk> .
He <unk> <unk> on the <unk> of this <unk> <unk> , and when <unk> <unk> , he <unk> a dog .
He <unk> the dog and created a <unk> , with the <unk> <unk> has created a <unk> , has <unk> a dog , and it 's <unk> to <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
What 's going to talk about <unk> ? [ <unk> ] And that , in different ways , [ <unk> ] [ <unk> ] [ <unk> ] and all the world 's <unk> .
<unk> <unk> the <unk> government has <unk> to <unk> the <unk> control of a larger area of California and <unk> <unk> together .
It 's their new <unk> . It 's called <unk> .
It 's a <unk> <unk> . It <unk> all the <unk> <unk> .
One <unk> example of how a <unk> can <unk> with its <unk> .
And , finally , I think it 's pretty <unk> at least who has been in these <unk> <unk> <unk> areas on the planet , that they realize that they 're not not going to happen .
For somebody is home .
<unk> <unk> of human imagination that <unk> to the <unk> of the time . And for us all , the dreams of these children , like the dreams of our children , they become part of the <unk> hope of that .
<unk> , we <unk> <unk> , we are <unk> that <unk> never <unk> to anything .
I 'm going to say that <unk> --
And they 're not <unk> , but we believe that stories can change the world , and maybe we are the best to tell the stories of the world . Every month our website <unk> million <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> our <unk> .
Our <unk> are <unk> by millions of people .
Our work is <unk> in <unk> to bring our audience to our audience to <unk> places that <unk> away from what they saw and , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> world in <unk> , and we need to find a <unk> <unk> of <unk> , the <unk> world of <unk> in <unk> , and we need to find a <unk> world and <unk> .
where the <unk> of all the <unk> can <unk> to our <unk> <unk> .
Thank you .
I 'm going to talk about some things that I wrote in this book that I hope you 've heard some of it and <unk> to <unk> some <unk> , in the case you don 't .
I want to start with what I call " the <unk> <unk> . "
<unk> <unk> what ?
The <unk> of all the <unk> society will be . The <unk> <unk> <unk> : " If we want to <unk> <unk> of our citizens . " The way to do it is to <unk> freedom . "
And the reason is , from one side , in fact that freedom is <unk> is <unk> itself , <unk> <unk> to human beings .
On the other one is that if we 're <unk> , each of us can act to <unk> to their own <unk> , without anybody who 's going to <unk> our own <unk> , without anybody who <unk> .
The way to <unk> the freedom is to <unk> .
The more <unk> people , the more <unk> are <unk> , and the greater about their freedom , the <unk> is their <unk> .
This is , <unk> , <unk> is so <unk> in the society that no one <unk> <unk> .
And it 's also <unk> <unk> in our lives .
So , I 'm going to show you some examples of what the progress has made possible .
This is my <unk> . It 's not particularly big .
I <unk> a simple note on the <unk> to <unk> .
In my <unk> , there are <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> and the 12 <unk> <unk> that you can buy a huge number of <unk> in the <unk> that nobody already <unk> in the <unk> <unk> that no one of the <unk> <unk> is <unk> .
That 's what <unk> is .
Then you go to the <unk> store to buy a <unk> : <unk> , <unk> , radio , <unk> , <unk> , radio , <unk> , <unk> .
And in the single <unk> store , there 's a big number of <unk> <unk> .
We can make six million different <unk> using the <unk> that there are only one store .
<unk> <unk> that there is <unk> .
<unk> <unk> : the world of <unk> .
Once , when I was a kid , you could get all the services <unk> , to <unk> that they were <unk> by <unk> <unk> .
You <unk> the phone , you don 't <unk> it .
And a <unk> of that , it was that the phone never <unk> .
These days are gone .
We have a <unk> <unk> <unk> , especially between cell phones .
That 's cell phones .
My <unk> is in the middle , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> of <unk> , and <unk> for the <unk> <unk> .
If you haven 't seen it in the store , you 're very well , very very soon that they soon <unk> .
And what happens is that people <unk> into the <unk> and ask this question . And you know what the answer is , " No . "
It 's not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn 't face .
So , in other <unk> of life that are much more important than <unk> , you <unk> the same <unk> .
<unk> <unk> : <unk> is not going on in the United States that you 're <unk> from the <unk> and the <unk> you what you have to do .
Instead , <unk> from the <unk> , and the <unk> says , " OK , we could do A , or <unk> " A , you know , you can do it . " And he mean , " he 's got these <unk> and these <unk> . What do you ? "
You <unk> him : " What do you do ? "
And the <unk> says , " <unk> has these <unk> and <unk> these <unk> , and <unk> has these <unk> and <unk> these <unk> . "
" What do you want to do ? "
And you say , " <unk> if you were me , what would you do ? "
And the <unk> : " But I 'm not her . "
And the result we call " <unk> <unk> , " <unk> " , " which makes it look like a very good thing .
But actually , it 's not a <unk> that <unk> the weight and the responsibility to make decisions from someone who knows something , <unk> the <unk> , to <unk> something that doesn 't knows -- and almost certainly <unk> -- and so not in the <unk> <unk> to make the patient decisions .
There 's a huge <unk> of <unk> products , <unk> to people like me and you , that if you think about it doesn 't make sense , because we can 't <unk> .
But if we can 't <unk> , why can we get them ?
The answer is that they want to <unk> the <unk> to <unk> the <unk> .
And <unk> to <unk> that is the <unk> of <unk> , as you see in this <unk> . " We don 't want to <unk> children . <unk> their sex at the right time . " We don 't <unk> . " We 're not going to be <unk> .
And we can <unk> how many times we <unk> .
which means every <unk> , <unk> , you have to decide that kind of person .
<unk> to the family and <unk> , a common time perspective , to almost everybody , it was that <unk> <unk> as soon as possible , and you <unk> to <unk> the <unk> possible .
The only real choice was with who , not when , and not even what to do later .
<unk> , it 's really to play .
They were <unk> very smart students , and they <unk> 20 percent less than a time .
And not because they 're <unk> , not because they 're <unk> .
But why are they <unk> , they ask <unk> , " <unk> <unk> or not ? "
" <unk> <unk> <unk> ? I have to think about <unk> or children or career ? "
They 're <unk> <unk> .
And they try to answer these questions , even though this <unk> , even though , I don 't get the <unk> that I don 't get the <unk> that I 'm going to try to answer my <unk> .
And they really have to do that . They 're important questions .
Now , the work : we 're <unk> , as <unk> <unk> , because the technology <unk> us to work every day , from every day , from every day , on the planet , <unk> that from the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , there 's a <unk> , and I 'm not going to tell anybody what , where the <unk> works .
I don 't tell you , because I want to use it .
What does this mean , this incredible choice that we have about the work ? It 's that we need to <unk> , <unk> at every moment , if we need to work or not .
We can go to see our son to play <unk> , with the cell phone in one <unk> , the other , and the <unk> , <unk> .
And even though they 're all <unk> , every minute we see our son , we 're also <unk> , " I have to answer this call ? "
" I have to answer this <unk> ? I have to take this letter ? "
And even when the answer is " no , " that makes the experience of the <unk> of your <unk> very son that would be in other conditions .
So , from any <unk> , you know , small things , big , materials and <unk> and <unk> , life is a question of choices .
And once the world was this : <unk> , there were some possibility , but it was not a question of choice .
The world today is to <unk> this : The <unk> is , " Is it a <unk> , or <unk> ? "
The answer is <unk> .
<unk> <unk> we all know , so I 'm going to talk about the <unk> .
<unk> this choice is two effects effects effects of people .
The first one , <unk> is that <unk> instead of <unk> .
With many <unk> between which choice , it becomes very difficult to do .
I 'm going to give you an example . A study on the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
A <unk> of my <unk> to the <unk> data , the <unk> society to <unk> <unk> , with about a million <unk> in different companies .
What she discovered is that for every 10 solutions that are <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> two percent .
With 50 <unk> <unk> , there 's 10 percent less than <unk> <unk> to when they 're only <unk> . Why ?
Because with 50 <unk> between which choice , is to be difficult to decide , and the choice is <unk> to the <unk> .
And <unk> , and again , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and of course , <unk> , never comes .
<unk> that doesn 't mean that just it doesn 't just mean that these <unk> <unk> food to <unk> because they don 't have enough money , it means that the decision is so <unk> that they 're also <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> , they 're not <unk> , they 're <unk> up to <unk> <unk> <unk> for year from the work , which would be well <unk> to <unk> .
So <unk> is a <unk> of having <unk> choices .
And I think we 're going to <unk> the world like this .
" And finally , to end the <unk> : <unk> , <unk> or <unk> ? "
They 're really going to make the right decision , if it 's for the <unk> , isn 't it ?
You don 't want to choose the wrong wrong , and <unk> the <unk> wrong .
So that 's the first effect . The second is that even if we can <unk> <unk> and make a choice , at the end of how we 're <unk> by the result of how to <unk> .
And that 's for different reasons .
One of them is that with many <unk> between which choice , if you <unk> one , you know , it 's not perfect , it 's easy to imagine that they could make a different choice that would be better . And what 's happening is that the <unk> <unk> <unk> us to <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> <unk> by <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> <unk> ,
even when it was a <unk> decision .
The more choices there are , <unk> <unk> of any <unk> that <unk> <unk> of <unk> .
And there 's what <unk> call .
Dan <unk> has <unk> very well <unk> like the value that we give things to <unk> from what <unk> <unk> .
<unk> , when you get a lot of <unk> possible , it 's easy to <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> and being <unk> <unk> .
Here 's an example . I 'm <unk> with all the ones that are not in New York .
But that 's what 's probably <unk> .
There 's this <unk> <unk> .
A place of <unk> .
<unk> <unk> . <unk> day . It 's all about them .
It doesn 't <unk> anything . But what he thinks is , " Well , <unk> , it 's <unk> . "
" All my <unk> are away . "
" <unk> <unk> just in front of the home . "
And it 's going to take two weeks from the idea that 's <unk> -- every day -- the <unk> <unk> where it wants .
The <unk> <unk> for what we have , even when the choice was <unk> .
And the <unk> that we have from <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , you <unk> against how to <unk> .
Here 's another example .
This <unk> tells us a lot of things .
It 's about living the moment , and maybe a living slowly .
But the most important point is that anything you 're going to happen , you 're not doing the other .
The things that don 't <unk> have a lot of <unk> that can make less <unk> what we do .
<unk> <unk> .
I tried it on my skin <unk> a new couple of <unk> .
It 's almost always <unk> .
Once the <unk> were a only guy , they <unk> them and <unk> from <unk> , were <unk> , only after they had a life and <unk> a lot of times , they <unk> to go well .
So , I went to <unk> a new couple , when the <unk> were gone , and I said , " I need a couple of <unk> , this is my <unk> . "
And the <unk> said , " <unk> wants to <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> ? "
Do you want them to <unk> or <unk> ? "
" Do you want them to <unk> ? "
" <unk> wants to <unk> them or <unk> ? <unk> <unk> <unk> -- " <unk> to <unk> .
I was <unk> , and after a little bit I was able to say , " I want the guy that -- which was the only guy , " he had no idea what it was , so for an hour , I all <unk> <unk> <unk> , and then <unk> out from the store , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> the best <unk> I had ever .
It was the <unk> . With all that choice , I had better .
But I <unk> it .
Why ? I wrote a whole book to <unk> .
And the reason I was worse is that with all that choice my <unk> were <unk> , the <unk> <unk> to be <unk> .
I had <unk> <unk> . I didn 't tell you anything about <unk> when I just <unk> one like , but when I <unk> 100 different , I <unk> , at least one kind had to be perfect .
What I had <unk> was good , but not perfect .
After <unk> that , I <unk> with what I was <unk> in <unk> to <unk> .
The <unk> of <unk> in the lives of people don 't make the <unk> that they have <unk> to the <unk> of the same .
And this <unk> <unk> , even when the results are good .
<unk> in the world of <unk> is <unk> .
Because if you <unk> it , I don 't understand what I 'm talking about .
The <unk> truth is to this .
" It was better when you were worse , " The reason you were worse when he was worse , when he was worse , it was <unk> that when he was worse , he still <unk> .
<unk> , in the world that we live in -- <unk> , <unk> citizens with the <unk> -- the <unk> that we can <unk> is that things are <unk> to the <unk> of <unk> .
You 've never seen <unk> because your <unk> , my <unk> , <unk> are <unk> .
The <unk> of happiness -- what you 're here -- is , " <unk> <unk> " Yes , you want to . "
I mean , little <unk> moment -- which I 'm really <unk> and my wife is really <unk> .
I couldn 't have done better , I didn 't <unk> .
But <unk> not always <unk> .
<unk> , a <unk> of buy a couple of <unk> , when you have that only the kind of <unk> is that when you 're not <unk> , and you say , " Why ? "
Who is <unk> ? " <unk> is <unk> . "
The world is <unk> . What can I do ?
When you have hundreds of types of <unk> , and you get one <unk> , and you <unk> a <unk> , and you <unk> that you are .
I could have done better .
With hundreds of <unk> available , there are no <unk> to <unk> .
So when people make decisions , even though the <unk> is <unk> , they <unk> <unk> and give their own <unk> .
In the last few years , the <unk> is <unk> in the world .
I think a <unk> <unk> -- not the only , but important -- of this <unk> <unk> is that people have <unk> experiences because the standard are too <unk> .
And when they need to <unk> this situation they think that <unk> is them .
So the final result is that we 're better , <unk> , <unk> , but we 're worse .
I 'm going to tell you .
This is the <unk> <unk> , what we all take for good and is completely <unk> .
There 's no <unk> that a little bit of choice is better than <unk> at all , but from this doesn 't make a lot choice is better than a little bit .
There 's a <unk> value , <unk> . I don 't know what it is .
But I 'm quite sure we <unk> from a piece the level that the choices <unk> our lives .
Now , from the <unk> point -- I 'm almost done -- from the point of view , the <unk> is <unk> .
And what allows all this choice in the <unk> society is the material .
There are many places in the world , and you know , you know , where the problem is not that they have <unk> choice .
The problem is they have too <unk> .
So the <unk> I 'm talking about is a <unk> <unk> of <unk> , <unk> society .
And what <unk> does <unk> and <unk> is this : <unk> <unk> <unk> talked about yesterday about how the <unk> and <unk> <unk> to be <unk> . It 's a <unk> <unk> .
I mean that these choices , <unk> and <unk> , not they just <unk> .
They 're <unk> <unk> .
They make us worse .
If a little bit of what in our society allows choice to be <unk> in those where people have too few people , it wouldn 't just be their life to <unk> , but our own .
This is what <unk> call a <unk> <unk> .
A <unk> of <unk> is good for everybody -- not just to the poor -- because of this choice in <unk> that we have .
So to end : " <unk> , you can get all the way you want to get ...
<unk> , people of culture , <unk> : " But what 's going to happen ? "
" It 's <unk> that you can 't do anything in a <unk> <unk> . "
" A <unk> imagination , a <unk> view of the world --
and <unk> I <unk> it like this , at the beginning .
But then , <unk> , I realized that that fish knows it 's a long .
Because the reality of <unk> is that if you <unk> in <unk> <unk> , so that it 's possible , " you can 't <unk> the freedom . You <unk> the <unk> .
If you <unk> the <unk> so that it 's going to be possible to <unk> the <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> .
Everybody needs a <unk> .
This is almost certainly too <unk> , maybe even for the fish , and certainly for the fish , and certainly for us .
But the <unk> of some <unk> <unk> is a <unk> for <unk> and , <unk> , for <unk> .
Thank you very much .
