<unk> year I showed these <unk> for <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , which for almost three million years , has had the size of the United States <unk> , <unk> is <unk> 40 percent .
We <unk> this <unk> the <unk> of the problem because it 's not <unk> the ice <unk> .
<unk> <unk> is , in a certain sense , the heart <unk> of climate <unk> system .
They <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
The next <unk> is going to be a <unk> <unk> on the last 25 years .
<unk> <unk> are <unk> in red .
You see , you 're <unk> up to the blue <unk> .
That 's the ice in <unk> , which is <unk> in summer .
You can see the <unk> ice <unk> , of five years or more , is like the blood , which here <unk> from the body .
In 25 years , it 's <unk> , like this .
This is a problem because the <unk> <unk> <unk> around the ocean <unk> where there are are enormous amount of <unk> <unk> , <unk> , they 're <unk> , <unk> , they 're <unk> , <unk> , and they 're <unk> in <unk> .
<unk> at the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> , that amount of <unk> could <unk> , <unk> this point of not <unk> .
In some <unk> <unk> <unk> is already <unk> by the water .
<unk> <unk> <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> ! <unk> : <unk> <unk> . She 's good . The question is if you 're <unk> .
One reason is this <unk> <unk> <unk> .
This is a <unk> river <unk> .
<unk> had never <unk> <unk> <unk> .
This is the <unk> river , in the <unk> of the <unk> .
If you want to know how the <unk> level of the sea level for the <unk> of <unk> , here is where the sea .
These <unk> are <unk> <unk> .
<unk> on the other hand of the planet : <unk> , the biggest <unk> of the planet .
<unk> month , the <unk> scientists who <unk> the <unk> of the ice is in <unk> , and that <unk> <unk> <unk> , is particularly <unk> in <unk> .
<unk> <unk> feet of the <unk> , like <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , the third <unk> of ice , you see new <unk> , which few years ago , they were <unk> .
40 percent of the world population <unk> <unk> water from <unk> .
<unk> <unk> : This is the source of the water <unk> of this city .
<unk> is <unk> .
But when you <unk> , the same happens to the water .
In California , <unk> <unk> is <unk> <unk> percent .
<unk> <unk> are in crisis .
<unk> , like you read , they 're <unk> .
<unk> <unk> in the world 's <unk> to a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> are <unk> to a normal <unk> , and without <unk> .
<unk> sometimes in the last 30 years than <unk> <unk> <unk> .
This is a <unk> of all <unk> .
If you look in the context of the <unk> context , you can see the <unk> .
In the last five years , we 've <unk> <unk> <unk> of CO2 every day .
Look at the <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and on both parts of the <unk> <unk> , where there 's a <unk> <unk> of oxygen in the ocean .
The biggest <unk> of global warming , together , with <unk> , which is 20 percent , is the use of <unk> <unk> .
<unk> is a problem , and <unk> is even even even even even even even even even even even even even even .
The United States are one of the two countries with <unk> emissions , together .
And they 're <unk> to build a lot of other <unk> .
But we 're <unk> to a <unk> of direction .
These are the <unk> projects in the last years and some <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And then , there 's a <unk> politics in our country .
<unk> <unk> and oil have <unk> <unk> <unk> million dollars in the last year to <unk> <unk> <unk> , which is a <unk> .
I 'm going to <unk> something --
<unk> <unk> , in <unk> , where I live , there was a <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Maybe you saw the <unk> .
This is the <unk> <unk> in America .
It 's happened around <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> of one of <unk> <unk> was this .
<unk> : <unk> ♫ ♫ <unk> is a kind of <unk> and happy .
It 's <unk> here in America , and it 's going to <unk> our economy .
<unk> the <unk> is more <unk> .
It 's <unk> , <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> here is a lot of the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The biggest <unk> society on the <unk> is <unk> . This is his <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> -- <unk> <unk> -- <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> -- not know what they 're talking about about .
<unk> : So <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
This is a one of them , a part .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> <unk> to see the changes <unk> like a <unk> <unk> to our business .
So , this <unk> is <unk> a great amount of money in a <unk> <unk> to make public <unk> to make it <unk> to make it public <unk> .
In fact , the <unk> is not <unk> .
We think it 's <unk> -- it 's also a good <unk> .
So we don 't <unk> about climate change .
We 're going to do it .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> -- you 've heard about a very much .
So , we <unk> a <unk> structure for the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> ! <unk> are a little <unk> , but this is the sound of the <unk> of <unk> technology .
<unk> <unk> is between the <unk> of global <unk> , but the <unk> technology of global <unk> , but the <unk> technology that you see changes everything .
<unk> look at a : this is the <unk> technology of <unk> <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to the economic question and <unk> of the national security .
<unk> : <unk> America is in crisis ; the economy , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> crisis .
The <unk> that <unk> all of <unk> : our <unk> <unk> <unk> , like <unk> <unk> and <unk> oil .
Now , there 's a new , <unk> solution to <unk> .
<unk> America : 100 percent of <unk> energy , in 10 years .
A plan for <unk> America to work , more <unk> , and to help <unk> global warming .
<unk> , a solution that we <unk> to solve our problems .
<unk> America . <unk> of more .
<unk> : This is the last .
<unk> : It 's <unk> energy to America .
One of the most <unk> ways of <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> our planet .

<unk> : A old <unk> says , " If you want to go to <unk> , you go to <unk> , you go to .
If you want to go away , you go together . "
We have to go away , quickly .
Thank you very much .
<unk> year , I did a <unk> <unk> on the <unk> .
And they <unk> to <unk> it on how the car works .
So , there 's <unk> . And for those that the other time , there were not , the <unk> is the <unk> <unk> .
His task is to <unk> the conditions that were in less than a <unk> of a <unk> of the universe -- to <unk> million times a second .
All of this is just <unk> .
This is the car under <unk> .
They <unk> these <unk> into the <unk> .
This is what I work . It 's called <unk> -- it 's <unk> <unk> feet and it has a <unk> feet .
This is a <unk> image of <unk> in building so you can see the <unk> .
The 10 <unk> of the last year we <unk> the car for the first time .
And this picture was <unk> by <unk> .
It was because of <unk> <unk> in the room of control .
It 's an image of the first <unk> particles that had done everything <unk> around the <unk> , <unk> , with a part of the <unk> , and <unk> particles in the <unk> .
In other words , when you <unk> this image of the 10 <unk> , <unk> the <unk> machine , the <unk> <unk> , which is a great <unk> .
I don 't know if it was this <unk> to do it more or this , when somebody <unk> on Google and <unk> that the <unk> page was this .
What we had a <unk> impact over the scientific <unk> .
<unk> a week later , there was a problem with the car , we had to have these <unk> here -- these <unk> <unk> .
These <unk> <unk> <unk> when the car works at the <unk> of the <unk> .
Now , <unk> between you <unk> <unk> and <unk> , " It 's not true . I 'm <unk> too <unk> . "
And they can do that because they 're very <unk> <unk> <unk> .
So , at less <unk> degrees , at a temperature temperature <unk> to the stars , these <unk> can bring that <unk> .
In one of the <unk> of <unk> <unk> in the <unk> , there was a <unk> <unk> .
So the <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
This was the result .
Now , this is more <unk> if you think that these <unk> <unk> <unk> more than 20 <unk> , and that you 're <unk> about 30 <unk> .
They 're about 50 <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , what we did .
We <unk> them and <unk> .
They 're going to <unk> all their <unk> place .
We <unk> the end of <unk> <unk> is going to be again .
We <unk> it , and we <unk> it to get data to <unk> or <unk> , and we continue to <unk> what the <unk> <unk> the universe .
Now , of course , in a way , these <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> of science and engineering <unk> . It 's easy to <unk> . It 's easy to <unk> .
I think the fact that it 's so hard , the fact , the <unk> <unk> , I think it 's the value of things like <unk> .
I 'd like to <unk> with the words of a <unk> <unk> , which , <unk> , <unk> , which , <unk> , in <unk> <unk> <unk> , he said , " It 's not <unk> for the <unk> of the human mind as the <unk> of human mind as <unk> , which is <unk> , <unk> , that there are not <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> . "
Thank you .
I want to start <unk> to <unk> when , children , <unk> with <unk> .
As <unk> as <unk> and <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , actually , to actually think about <unk> problems and <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> is <unk> to the way we <unk> a lot of the world around us .
So , from <unk> <unk> from the <unk> of our <unk> with <unk> objects , with my <unk> <unk> , and my <unk> <unk> <unk> , I started <unk> , and I started <unk> <unk> , " And if we use a computer , instead of having the <unk> <unk> like <unk> , <unk> <unk> , like a <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> ,
and <unk> to our <unk> ?
The question was so interesting that we 're going to <unk> the answer , building <unk> .
In a few words , a <unk> is a great computer like a <unk> .
In a few words , a <unk> is a great computer like a <unk> .
You can <unk> with the hand , they can <unk> them , " <unk> , " <unk> , " <unk> , " <unk> , " <unk> . "
But <unk> , they 're <unk> , like <unk> , you can <unk> <unk> .
<unk> is the <unk> example of a new <unk> of tools for <unk> information information .
And as they become more <unk> , <unk> of the <unk> movement , of others , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , we can explore and <unk> <unk> of <unk> .
We 're going to <unk> with some simple example .
This <unk> is <unk> to show you a video : if you <unk> it in a direction , the video <unk> , so , if you 're going to go back to a <unk> .
These <unk> <unk> are <unk> of others .
If you <unk> them , you 're going to <unk> them ,
If they <unk> it , they can <unk> it and they can <unk> it .
If they <unk> it , they can <unk> it and they can <unk> it .
They also <unk> their movement and <unk> .
We 're <unk> that one of the interesting <unk> of the <unk> was that we can use <unk> <unk> on data , to example , " <unk> a color like it was a <unk> .
In this case , we have three <unk> <unk> like <unk> <unk> and I can <unk> it for <unk> <unk> of color , where they <unk> .
and I can <unk> it for <unk> color , where you 're <unk> .
We can <unk> it too much , we can <unk> it a little bit .
I 'm also <unk> <unk> <unk> , like <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> games where people can try and and <unk> the results .
Now I 'm --
This is a <unk> sequence that I do with a <unk> program .
Here we have a <unk> of words that 's <unk> half of <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> , at every <unk> <unk> a letter to every <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , to every <unk> <unk> , and <unk> , at <unk> , and as <unk> <unk> words , he <unk> him on a <unk> .
Then , after about 30 seconds , and you have a new <unk> of <unk> and you have a new <unk> , and you have a new <unk> <unk> .
Thank you .
Here 's here of the children in <unk> <unk> , I did it in a way that <unk> them and I <unk> a video .
They 're very <unk> .
And one of the interesting things of this kind of <unk> is that you don 't have to <unk> people .
They just say , " <unk> , " and they know exactly what to do .
Here 's other people who <unk> it .
This is our <unk> <unk> <unk> , there right .
It 's actually wanted to <unk> .
They were just <unk> , for him .
Now , this is a <unk> of a <unk> <unk> .
We wanted to build a tool for the <unk> of the <unk> . He 's <unk> .
It can <unk> new characters in the scene , <unk> their <unk> .
It can <unk> new characters in the scene , <unk> their <unk> .
So here 's doing the sun .
<unk> : The sun is <unk> .
David <unk> : Now he took a <unk> in the scene .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> .
<unk> ! Yeah ! <unk> !
So , we <unk> the <unk> and <unk> can <unk> the characters --
<unk> : <unk> !
<unk> its story .
<unk> : <unk> !
<unk> : It 's a <unk> story , and you can decide it as you <unk> .
<unk> : It 's a <unk> story , and you can decide it as you <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> , <unk> .
<unk> : The last example I have the time to show you is a tool , <unk> <unk> , for <unk> and <unk> music .
It 's a recent <unk> , for <unk> and <unk> music .
The <unk> here <unk> <unk> like , <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> of these has four different <unk> , and you can choose what to use .
You can also <unk> these <unk> in a sequence from <unk> to your <unk> .
And they just <unk> it <unk> a <unk> " sound , " and a <unk> . "
These are actually <unk> that you can control out of the live , like <unk> and <unk> .
We <unk> it to a particular sound and then <unk> it for <unk> .
And then there are the <unk> of time and <unk> , which is <unk> to the whole sequence .
<unk> like it works .
<unk> : <unk> : <unk> a <unk> <unk> in two <unk> <unk> , " <unk> in a series , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> ,
Now , you 'll <unk> a <unk> line .
<unk> : <unk> <unk> . Now <unk> <unk> --
<unk> : And now I <unk> the <unk> to the <unk> , so I can control the <unk> effect .
<unk> : <unk> : I can <unk> the whole time by one side or another .
<unk> : And now we 're going to <unk> the <unk> to give more <unk> .
<unk> : <unk> : I can <unk> the sequence . "
So I don 't have to <unk> before , but I can <unk> , <unk> , <unk> more or more <unk> .
And now , finally , I can <unk> the whole <unk> sequence on the left the <unk> <unk> .
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is to build new <unk> <unk> more <unk> to how they work work in our brain and body .
And today , I had time to show you one of the results of this way , and even some possibility that we try to take out of the lab .
The concept I want to <unk> is that 's <unk> this new generation of objects <unk> to <unk> with the media , which is <unk> information in our world , which is <unk> information in our world ,
Thank you very much .
I don 't see the <unk> now of you .
I 'm a <unk> .
<unk> books is my <unk> , but it 's more than this , of course .
It 's also love and my <unk> of my life .
And I don 't think that it can change .
But , I said this , something particular is happened in my life and in my career , who <unk> me to <unk> the whole relationship with this work .
The particular thing is that I wrote this book , this <unk> called " <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , " which , <unk> , " which , <unk> , " which was <unk> , " <unk> , " <unk> .
And the result is that everywhere now , people <unk> me like if I was <unk> .
<unk> -- <unk> , <unk> !
I 'm going to <unk> all <unk> and they say , " You don 't have fear to do better ?
You don 't fear to write all the life without the more able to be able to create a book that can <unk> to somebody ? "
that can <unk> <unk> to somebody ? "
It 's <unk> , you know .
But it could go worse , I remember that more than 20 years ago , when I was saying to say to people -- I was a <unk> -- I was I wanted to be a <unk> .
I 'm going to <unk> the <unk> <unk> .
And people said , " Don 't <unk> to be <unk> ?
You don 't fear that <unk> you <unk> ?
You don 't fear to do this <unk> for all life without anything you ever <unk> and die on a <unk> of <unk> <unk> with the mouth of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> ? "
So , you know , you know .
The short answer to all these questions is , " Yeah . "
Yeah , I fear of all those things .
I 've always had fear .
And I also fear of a lot of other things that people don 't have .
As the <unk> and other things <unk> .
But , for how do I 'm going to write what I thought and <unk> <unk> is why ?
Is it <unk> ?
It 's <unk> that anybody who <unk> to be <unk> by a job that you feel born for a <unk> <unk> .
But what 's so particular <unk> in <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> about <unk> health health <unk> about a way that other <unk> <unk> doesn 't do ?
As my father , for example , he was a <unk> <unk> and I didn 't remember one time in his 40 years of activity in the 40 years of activity that he was asked to be <unk> ?
It 's never -- that <unk> of <unk> John , how do you go ?
<unk> 't that , <unk> ?
<unk> , the engineers like a group of course , in <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> to be <unk> <unk> .
We <unk> , we have this <unk> , and not only <unk> , but <unk> of all these kinds , we have this <unk> of being <unk> <unk> .
And we don 't want to look at the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> that , only in the <unk> century , <unk> young and often for their .
And those who don 't seem to be really <unk> by their <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , before they were going to die , in the last <unk> said , " Every book , " A <unk> <unk> about work about their life .
But we don 't <unk> when you say , because we heard these things so much <unk> we have a <unk> <unk> and <unk> the <unk> that creativity and <unk> are in some way we have a <unk> and <unk> , to the <unk> , at , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , always <unk> .
And the question I want to <unk> all here today is : you 're going to do with this idea ?
You 're going to be good for a <unk> distance to me not good for anything .
I think it 's <unk> .
And I think it 's <unk> and I don 't want to <unk> in the next century century .
I think it 's better <unk> our great <unk> to live .
And I think , in my case -- it 's going to be very <unk> to start <unk> to start to <unk> to <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in which I 'm in my career .
<unk> -- you 'll see , I 'm young , I 'm a 40 years .
I still about four <unk> of work in me .
And it 's very <unk> that any <unk> of now , what 's going to be <unk> by the world like the work that <unk> after <unk> <unk> of my last book .
<unk> <unk> , because we 're all more or less friends here -- it 's <unk> that my biggest success is to my <unk> .
Oh , <unk> , who thought !
You know this is the kind of thought that <unk> a person to start <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> at the nine of morning and I don 't want to do it .
I 'm going to continue to do this work that I love .
So , the question becomes , how do we ?
So , I think , after a lot of <unk> , which the way to work to write is to write about <unk> is to create a <unk> <unk> , right ?
I have to find a <unk> distance of security <unk> between me , which I 'm <unk> , and my natural <unk> on which is going to get out , and I was <unk> for all the last year models of how to do you <unk> to look through the time , looking through the time , looking at at time , and find more <unk> <unk> <unk> , if you have better ideas and <unk> <unk> <unk> , and find more society to find more society to find more <unk> society .
about how to help people <unk> <unk> <unk> of creativity .
And that research <unk> me to <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
They 're going to go back and then <unk> back .
<unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> -- people don 't believe that creativity <unk> of <unk> , OK ?
It <unk> that creativity was this <unk> spirit and <unk> to <unk> men from a few <unk> <unk> and <unk> , for reasons <unk> and <unk> , for reasons <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> <unk> these <unk> <unk> of creativity , " <unk> . "
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> to have a <unk> <unk> <unk> from <unk> .
<unk> were the same idea , but they <unk> that kind of <unk> spirit of <unk> .
The <unk> is <unk> , because <unk> <unk> didn 't really <unk> that a <unk> was somebody who was <unk> <unk> .
<unk> that a <unk> was this kind of <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> literally <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of a artist , like <unk> <unk> , and that <unk> out to <unk> <unk> the work of the artist and <unk> the result of that work of the artist and <unk> the result of that work .
<unk> <unk> here , that 's the distance of the distance that I talk -- that <unk> you 're going to <unk> you from the results of your work .
And everybody <unk> that was so <unk> , right ?
So artists were <unk> by <unk> things , like example , for example , <unk> <unk> , right ?
If your work was <unk> not <unk> to <unk> all the <unk> , all of <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> by this <unk> <unk> .
If your work , you didn 't know all your <unk> , right ?
All you know , it was your <unk> to be a <unk> .
And so the people <unk> creativity in <unk> for a long time .
And then the <unk> <unk> and all of <unk> , and we <unk> this great idea ; we put the human being on the center of the universe , all of the <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and without more space and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> without <unk> space .
This was the <unk> <unk> and people <unk> to think that creativity <unk> <unk> of <unk> .
And for the first time in the history , they <unk> to <unk> this or that artist like a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And I have to <unk> , I think it was a big <unk> .
I think that I would <unk> to somebody , a simple person to believe that as a <unk> , <unk> and <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> it 's a <unk> <unk> , <unk> and <unk> is a <unk> <unk> <unk> to human <unk> .
It 's like to somebody of <unk> the sun .
<unk> and <unk> the completely <unk> and create all these <unk> <unk> on the <unk> .
And I think it 's this pressure to have <unk> artists in the <unk> 500 years .
And , if this is true , and I think it 's , the question becomes , and now ?
We can do that <unk> ?
We 'll go back to a more understanding of the relationship between humans and <unk> <unk> .
Or maybe no .
Maybe we can 't <unk> 500 years of <unk> thinking in a <unk> <unk> of <unk> 18 minutes .
And there 's people in the audience that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> on the <unk> of <unk> , you <unk> , you <unk> people <unk> <unk> on their projects .
You probably don 't <unk> you all about this thing .
But the question I 'd like to <unk> is -- why ?
Why don 't you <unk> it in this way ?
Because it 's more sense of every other thing that has ever heard to explain the <unk> of the <unk> process .
A process that , as anyone who ever <unk> to do something -- so , we 're going to be <unk> .
And in fact , it can be completely <unk> .
I did this <unk> <unk> with the amazing <unk> <unk> , who has now now 90 years , but it was a <unk> for all life and he said that during his <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> out in the <unk> , and <unk> it , in the <unk> , in the <unk> , and <unk> , in the <unk> , if you <unk> from <unk> .
He said she was like a <unk> <unk> .
And that <unk> <unk> to her from <unk> .
We <unk> it , because he was <unk> the land under his feet .
They had to have one thing to do that point and it was , words , " <unk> like a <unk> . "
And so we <unk> it to the house and it was <unk> by this <unk> , and it didn 't have to take a piece of paper and a <unk> enough <unk> , as the <unk> , <unk> and <unk> on the page .
Sometimes I didn 't <unk> to be <unk> enough , so <unk> and <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> without able to get home and she would <unk> it through and she would <unk> it up with the <unk> , and he would <unk> it , and he would <unk> it . "
Then there were those times -- this piece of never -- there were the moments -- there were the moments where the was almost <unk> , right ?
So , he was <unk> home and he was looking at home and <unk> the <unk> through , and he <unk> a <unk> , just in the <unk> , and then he said , it was like , if you <unk> with the other hand and <unk> .
<unk> the <unk> of the tail and the <unk> in his body and the <unk> on the page .
And in these cases , the <unk> would be <unk> on the page and <unk> , but at the last word .
So when you <unk> it -- it 's <unk> , it 's <unk> , it 's <unk> to my <unk> process .
I don 't know my <unk> process -- I 'm not a <unk> !
I 'm a <unk> , and my way of <unk> is ; they <unk> it <unk> every day and <unk> and work and work and <unk> on <unk> .
But even I , in my <unk> , I <unk> against that thing , sometimes .
And I think that many of you <unk> the <unk> .
You know , even if the work and ideas <unk> me <unk> me from a certain source I couldn 't <unk> .
And what is this thing ?
And how we can <unk> it to it <unk> it in a way we don 't have to <unk> your mind , but rather , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> ,
So , as I 'm going to be <unk> for the <unk> <unk> <unk> , which I <unk> <unk> <unk> , which I <unk> different years ago for a <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> , and you know , <unk> , for the <unk> of life was the <unk> of the artist artist <unk> , trying to control , <unk> these species of <unk> <unk> <unk> .
But then <unk> , he was <unk> , and a day as he was <unk> on a <unk> <unk> , <unk> it for him .
<unk> <unk> , and it 's all of a <unk> <unk> this little <unk> of <unk> , who comes into his mind as a <unk> <unk> , and you want , you , it 's wonderful , and you know , but it doesn 't know how to <unk> .
It doesn 't have a <unk> piece , it doesn 't have a <unk> ,
So it starts to hear this kind of old <unk> <unk> in him , like , " I 'm going to <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> from this <unk> song .
I 'm not <unk> enough , and I can 't <unk> . "
And instead of go in <unk> , they <unk> .
<unk> the whole <unk> process and did something completely new .
<unk> just the sky and he said , " <unk> , you don 't see that I 'm <unk> ? "
" You know , you can write a song now ?
If you really want to <unk> , you 're going to take care of you .
<unk> , <unk> to <unk> <unk> more today .
They 're going to <unk> <unk> <unk> . "
And his <unk> process after this .
I didn 't work , the work was still <unk> like always .
But the process , and the <unk> that <unk> was <unk> when <unk> the <unk> , the <unk> that was <unk> when he <unk> the <unk> , and he <unk> it back from , and he was <unk> that it didn 't have to be a <unk> .
but <unk> this <unk> , wonderful <unk> <unk> a conversation between <unk> and this thing <unk> and <unk> , but it wasn 't <unk> .
So , how <unk> this story to change a little bit about the way I <unk> and already <unk> me .
This idea , I was <unk> when I was <unk> , " <unk> , " and <unk> , " and <unk> , " and I <unk> it in a <unk> that we 're working on something and we can 't think that a <unk> , it 's going to be the <unk> book .
Not just <unk> , just <unk> , just <unk> .
And we 're going to think of <unk> this project .
But then I 'm going to <unk> me that <unk> to the air and <unk> .
So I <unk> my face in the <unk> and <unk> my <unk> to a <unk> <unk> <unk> of the room .
And I said to <unk> <unk> , " <unk> , what , is , both we know that if this book is not going to be <unk> <unk> , no ?
Because as you see I 'm going to show you all that I 'm not going to be <unk> .
So if you want it to be better , you have to <unk> your part .
OK . But if you don 't do it , you know what , I don 't do it .
I 'm going to write the same because it 's my work .
And I 'd like to say that I 'm going to <unk> me to do my <unk> . " Because it 's so , it 's like , " <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , people <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> of the moon , and <unk> music that <unk> <unk> , <unk> music that <unk> <unk> for hours to <unk> .
And they were always <unk> , because the <unk> were <unk> and they were <unk> .
But every <unk> , something <unk> , and something <unk> of these <unk> artists <unk> actually <unk> .
And I know you know what I talk about , because I know you 've got it all of a <unk> , a <unk> like this .
It was like , if the time <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> through a kind of <unk> and he wasn 't doing anything different from <unk> , as the <unk> <unk> , before , but everything <unk> .
And at a sudden not just like a human .
But they <unk> from <unk> and <unk> under the <unk> of <unk> .
And when this <unk> , to the people <unk> what was , they <unk> it with her name .
<unk> your hands and <unk> to <unk> , " <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , God , "
That 's God , you know .
<unk> <unk> -- when the <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> this <unk> with them and <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> , " <unk> , " <unk> , " <unk> , " <unk> , " <unk> , " <unk> , " <unk> , " <unk> , " <unk> , " <unk> , " <unk> , " <unk> , " <unk> , " <unk> , " <unk> , " <unk> , " <unk> , " <unk> , " <unk> , " <unk> , " <unk> , " <unk> , " <unk> , "
In <unk> , when a artist has done something impossible and <unk> , " <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> -- a <unk> , <unk> -- a <unk> of God .
And it 's <unk> because we need .
But , the problem comes the day after , for <unk> , when you <unk> and <unk> that are <unk> 11 of <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> God 's <unk> . There 's no more .
It 's just a <unk> with a <unk> <unk> , and maybe never <unk> <unk> to <unk> that <unk> .
And maybe nobody <unk> the name of God still as <unk> , and so what it has to do with the rest of his life ?
It 's hard .
This is one of the most <unk> <unk> to do in a <unk> life .
But maybe it 's not to be so <unk> if you 're <unk> to <unk> , <unk> , that the <unk> <unk> of your being being being from you .
But <unk> just that you 're <unk> data in <unk> from a <unk> source of this <unk> part of your life you have to go to <unk> .
And , you know , if we think about this way .
So I started <unk> , and it 's <unk> , and it 's <unk> , I 'm <unk> for different months during the book that I was <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> of my <unk> success .
And what I have to continue to <unk> when I feel like this is , I 'm not going to be <unk> .
<unk> <unk> . <unk> just your work .
<unk> to <unk> your <unk> , any of the way , you can be .
If your work is <unk> , you 're <unk> .
If the <unk> , you 're going to <unk> you <unk> <unk> <unk> some kind of <unk> , for only <unk> <unk> , then , " <unk> ! "
<unk> , you 're doing the same <unk> .
And " <unk> ! " You 're going to do it .
I think , and I think it 's <unk> .
" <unk> ! " You know , even for <unk> love and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Thank you .
Thank you .
<unk> <unk> : <unk> !
You know , I 've already talked about some of these projects on the human genome , what can <unk> and <unk> new <unk> of genes .
We 're <unk> a new way , we started <unk> biology and now start <unk> biology and now start from that digital code of biology , <unk> and <unk> life .
We 've always tried to <unk> big questions .
" <unk> is life ? " It 's something that many <unk> I think they have <unk> to understand to different levels .
We 've tried a different <unk> , <unk> to the <unk> terms .
We 're <unk> by almost 20 years .
When we have <unk> the human genome <unk> to go from the world of biology world 's biology in the digital world of the computer .
Now we <unk> <unk> : we can <unk> life , or create new life from this digital universe ?
This is the map of a little <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , which is the <unk> species from the <unk> genome <unk> .
And we tried to <unk> the genome to <unk> a <unk> <unk> a more <unk> .
We 're able to <unk> a <unk> of <unk> about 500 genes that are here .
But when we take a look at his <unk> map , it 's simple than our .
<unk> , this is simple .
But when we look at all the genes that we can <unk> , one at the time , is very <unk> that this can take to take a <unk> cell .
So , I <unk> the only <unk> <unk> this <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> for some of these <unk> questions .
So we started the <unk> of the " <unk> , we can we <unk> a <unk> ? "
Can you have the <unk> chemistry to make these big molecules that we never have to create before we 're going to do before ?
And , in case , we can make a <unk> ?
A <unk> is just a <unk> piece of <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The speed that we 're able to <unk> life is <unk> <unk> .
Our ability to write the <unk> code , instead , rather <unk> , but it 's <unk> .
And our <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> of a <unk> <unk> .
We have more than 15 years ago .
<unk> has <unk> a lot of <unk> , <unk> with a <unk> <unk> before <unk> the first experiments .
But we found out that <unk> is very difficult .
There are <unk> of thousands of cars in the world that <unk> little <unk> of <unk> , <unk> of 30 <unk> <unk> , and it 's a <unk> process : the <unk> is <unk> , and it 's a <unk> process .
So we had to develop a new <unk> to <unk> these <unk> and <unk> the <unk> .
And this was our first <unk> , to start <unk> information <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> .
It 's a little virus that <unk> bacteria .
We designed the <unk> , <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> a <unk> of DNA <unk> of about <unk> <unk> .
The interesting part is when we took this piece of <unk> material <unk> and we <unk> it in bacteria , bacteria have <unk> to read this code and <unk> particles .
<unk> particles have been <unk> by the cells , they 're <unk> back and they <unk> <unk> .
I 've talked about the recent <unk> <unk> industry that they have certainly <unk> this model .
They have more than you .
So , that this is a situation where software can actually actually build its same <unk> in a <unk> system .
But we 're going to do the most <unk> things .
We wanted to build the whole <unk> of <unk> .
I 'm more <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
So we thought we 're going to <unk> in the <unk> of the virus of the virus , so that we can change the <unk> to understand what they 're the <unk> of a <unk> cell .
<unk> is <unk> , and if you 're <unk> with information information in a computer , these have to be very <unk> .
When we <unk> this genome for the first time in the <unk> <unk> was a <unk> for every 10 <unk> <unk> .
We found out , <unk> , 30 <unk> . If we 're used that original <unk> <unk> <unk> never been able to do that work .
A part of the process is <unk> 50 <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> with all other <unk> <unk> <unk> to build more little than <unk> .
We 're going to be <unk> here .
You probably read that that <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> : We have a <unk> <unk> on four <unk> : <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> of those <unk> <unk> together , about 20 <unk> , and there 's a <unk> order to <unk> every <unk> .
So we can use the <unk> code to write words , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
What we did at the beginning was <unk> .
Some of the <unk> that it wasn 't <unk> .
We designed these <unk> to <unk> <unk> .
There are <unk> that <unk> them and <unk> <unk> .
And we started <unk> <unk> , <unk> with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to their <unk> <unk> <unk> .
In every step , we 've made these <unk> in <unk> so that we 're <unk> to create a <unk> <unk> <unk> that we 're <unk> to see in a minute .
We 're trying to <unk> the process .
So , this looks like the <unk> of a <unk> <unk> .
When we started <unk> , we 're going to be <unk> , more than 100 <unk> <unk> , they didn 't <unk> directly in the <unk> <unk> .
It 's <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> of the biology <unk> .
So we have <unk> other <unk> .
We 're going to <unk> a <unk> <unk> , which in biology <unk> to <unk> the DNA <unk> in biology can <unk> .
Here 's a example .
This <unk> , called <unk> <unk> , it can <unk> three million <unk> <unk> .
You can see the <unk> <unk> like his <unk> <unk> is <unk> .
In 12 hours -- 24 hours it 's <unk> exactly like it was before .
We have thousands of organisms that are able to do that .
These organisms can <unk> <unk> .
They 're going to live under <unk> .
I 'm absolutely sure that life in space , and they 're <unk> to find new <unk> <unk> of water .
In fact , NASA has shown that this is .
This is a <unk> image of the <unk> that we built these <unk> , just using these <unk> , just using the <unk> design <unk> .
<unk> <unk> them .
This image was not <unk> with a <unk> <unk> , but with a <unk> <unk> .
It 's a <unk> so big that we can <unk> with a <unk> <unk> .
These are pictures that <unk> a time of about six seconds .
This is the <unk> we did a little time ago .
I 'm more <unk> <unk> of <unk> code .
It 's the biggest <unk> of a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
It has a <unk> weight to 300 million .
If you <unk> it with a <unk> 10 <unk> , we <unk> <unk> pages for this <unk> code .
Now , how do we work ? How do we <unk> ?
Of course , through a virus is a <unk> of kids .
It 's a little bit more <unk> when you 're using bacteria .
It 's more simple when it 's about <unk> cells like our : you can just <unk> the <unk> and <unk> another , which is actually the <unk> process .
In <unk> <unk> , the <unk> is instead of <unk> in the cell , but we have <unk> <unk> that we 're able to do a <unk> <unk> of a <unk> cell to another and <unk> .
We <unk> a <unk> <unk> from a kind of <unk> .
<unk> are different than men from <unk> .
We have some <unk> <unk> <unk> in more way to decide what to choose to this <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> all the <unk> <unk> so we <unk> all the <unk> .
And when we put it in the cell was <unk> and <unk> our <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> our <unk> <unk> is <unk> in the cell .
And we <unk> that we didn 't go beyond , but we tried to <unk> more in there .
This is one of the biggest <unk> of evolution .
We found out that <unk> species have <unk> a second or a third <unk> , <unk> in a second thousands of new <unk> to that species .
So who think about evolution as a <unk> <unk> at the time they <unk> doesn 't understand a lot of <unk> .
We <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> that was in the cell <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> that we <unk> it .
It 's <unk> , and it <unk> the other <unk> like <unk> material , and we 're <unk> with only <unk> , and we 're <unk> with only the cell and the new <unk> .
It 's become blue because of the genes we have <unk> .
And in a short <unk> of time , all the <unk> of a species are <unk> . And it 's <unk> , and it 's <unk> of all in a new software , <unk> , which we <unk> into the cell .
All the <unk> are <unk> , the <unk> are <unk> , and when you <unk> the <unk> code exactly exactly what we <unk> .
Now , this could be <unk> <unk> , but we can change the things in a <unk> , you can change the things in a <unk> .
Now , I 've already <unk> that here is not about <unk> -- but of progress to go from three million years and a half years of evolution , and I already said that maybe we 're going to create a new <unk> version of the <unk> <unk> <unk> in which <unk> new new species on this process .
Why do that ?
I think it 's pretty <unk> when we think about our <unk> .
We 're going to have six billion and a half billion people in the next 40 years .
<unk> for a example : I was born in <unk> .
Now there are three people on the planet to <unk> <unk> in <unk> ; they 'll be four years , there will be four .
We 're <unk> problems now at food , water <unk> and <unk> , <unk> and <unk> and <unk> , <unk> and <unk> and a half billion people .
We 're still <unk> to do that for nine billion .
<unk> more than five billion <unk> , more than 30 billion <unk> <unk> .
That means percent million <unk> a day .
When we try to find <unk> <unk> , or any kind of process to <unk> , it 's going to be a huge challenge .
In the most <unk> we have to <unk> the <unk> of CO2 from these materials that <unk> in the atmosphere .
At the day , with the <unk> <unk> around the world , we have a <unk> with about 20 million genes , and I like to think they 're the <unk> <unk> for the future .
<unk> industry only a <unk> about <unk> , and think about how many different things are <unk> out .
Our <unk> here are data from the <unk> reality , and from the <unk> reality .
Now we have <unk> , because of these <unk> <unk> <unk> , to these <unk> <unk> , to create what we call <unk> <unk> .
We 're able to build a big robot that can make a million <unk> a day .
Think of <unk> these 20 million genes or <unk> to try to <unk> <unk> <unk> to produce <unk> or <unk> , new <unk> , we can change , with a little team , and create more biology biology biology now that in the last 20 years of science .
And it 's just a <unk> <unk> .
We can choose to <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
This is a <unk> of some software software <unk> that we 're working on to be able to <unk> and design species to the computer .
Well , we don 't know how they 're going to be .
We know exactly what the <unk> code .
We 're <unk> on the <unk> of <unk> generation .
You saw you also <unk> from the <unk> <unk> was a <unk> experiment .
We have <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> enough to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , like <unk> or different kinds of <unk> .
But the only way that biology can have a big impact without <unk> <unk> the cost of food and <unk> <unk> the <unk> would be <unk> CO2 in matter , so we 're working on to <unk> cells that we 're working on the first <unk> generation in <unk> generation , and we think we can have the first <unk> of <unk> generation in about 18 months .
<unk> light <unk> with CO2 is a <unk> , but in our <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of the world , we found different <unk> .
This is a <unk> that we <unk> in <unk> .
<unk> in the ocean , about <unk> feet of <unk> <unk> <unk> .
We 're <unk> from CO2 using hydrogen <unk> like <unk> energy .
We 're trying to understand whether we can <unk> the CO2 , that can be <unk> through <unk> , <unk> that CO2 in <unk> , to drive this process .
So , we think that short we think we might be able to <unk> what the <unk> question of " which is the life , " is , we <unk> the <unk> goal of <unk> industry .
<unk> . If you can 't do that TED , where you can 't you do it from TED , where you can 't you .
We 're going to have a <unk> of energy .
<unk> , we 're working on to use the same <unk> to create <unk> <unk> .
You saw this year with flu , we 're always <unk> back to a year and with a dollar in less when it 's about <unk> .
I think what you can change building <unk> in <unk> .
So , here 's how to start <unk> , now , the tree of evolution , <unk> evolution with bacteria <unk> , <unk> , and finally <unk> cells .
We 're at so much from <unk> people .
Our purpose is to do in a way to live enough to try to try to try to try to try . Thank you very much .
First of all , I 'm going to show you , the <unk> <unk> , some <unk> work , some <unk> of the new technology that we 've <unk> at the <unk> <unk> almost a year ago . This is <unk> .
It 's a <unk> environment that you can <unk> is <unk> with a local level that <unk> with an enormous amount of data .
We 're seeing <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> with a kind of <unk> <unk> and <unk> , for a <unk> <unk> , <unk> images like .
And it doesn 't matter how big the amount of information that we see , how much of data are great .
Most of the common photographs , but this for example is a <unk> <unk> from the <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> , and <unk> in the <unk> of 300 <unk> .
It doesn 't make any difference because the only thing <unk> the <unk> of a system like this is the number of <unk> on your screen in any moment . It 's also a very <unk> architecture .
This is a whole book , example of data is not images .
This is <unk> <unk> . Every <unk> <unk> <unk> . Every <unk> <unk> .
So , in <unk> that 's just a <unk> of images , we can do something like that , to <unk> see that it 's a real <unk> of the <unk> , not a picture of a picture .
It could be a a way to read a <unk> book .
I 'm not going to <unk> it .
This is a more <unk> example . It 's about a <unk> number of <unk> .
Every image is the beginning of a <unk> .
And it gives you really <unk> to you know the <unk> <unk> version of a <unk> or a <unk> , which is for nature of a half a a half .
We also did something with the corner of this <unk> in particular number of this particular <unk> of <unk> .
We created a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
If you want to see the <unk> of this <unk> , you can see here .
Or another models , or even <unk> <unk> .
And this really <unk> some of these ideas to <unk> the <unk> of space on the screen .
We thought this <unk> <unk> to <unk> and other <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , not <unk> to be <unk> .
Of course , the <unk> is one of the most <unk> <unk> for this kind of technology .
And on this doesn 't want to lose time , if we don 't say that we have <unk> to give it in this field .
These are all the streets in the United States <unk> a NASA <unk> image .
So now I 'm going to <unk> something else .
This is actually actually <unk> in the web ; you can see it .
It 's a project called <unk> , which <unk> two different technologies .
A <unk> is <unk> and another is a very interesting research that <unk> <unk> <unk> , a student of <unk> Washington , with help <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . A <unk> <unk> . A <unk> <unk> . A <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And it 's alive on the web , <unk> <unk> .
You can <unk> when we do this kind of <unk> , where we can <unk> from another image to another and have this kind of experience <unk> <unk> .
But the <unk> of images here has actually actually a meaning .
<unk> <unk> of <unk> computers have these images together , so that <unk> to <unk> places that <unk> to <unk> places that <unk> <unk> all <unk> on the <unk> <unk> <unk> on the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . So you see some <unk> <unk> , and these things are all <unk> .
I don 't know if I have time to show you some other environment .
There are a lot more <unk> .
I want to go to one of the <unk> data <unk> and this <unk> <unk> from a <unk> <unk> of <unk> that we did work for the first time to show you what <unk> is really the key behind this technology , the <unk> technology , and it 's not so <unk> <unk> <unk> . And it 's not so <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that we have in the website .
We had to <unk> <unk> <unk> and on .
This is a <unk> of <unk> <unk> images from <unk> <unk> . <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> and <unk> images of <unk> and <unk> images of <unk> and <unk> . <unk> of these <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . It 's <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
So I 'm all <unk> images from <unk> and they 're all <unk> <unk> .
And it 's possible to <unk> this way .
You know , I would never have thought to work for <unk> .
It 's very <unk> <unk> <unk> this kind of <unk> here .
I think that 's a lot of a lot of different kinds of <unk> : <unk> <unk> <unk> , a number of <unk> , a <unk> number , <unk> together in this environment .
And if I can , I can <unk> <unk> <unk> .
Many are <unk> by <unk> , etc .
<unk> here is a <unk> of photographs -- <unk> .
This is a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
We can <unk> from the physics of this environment .
The <unk> is that we can do with social environment . This is now <unk> data from <unk> <unk> from the whole memory of <unk> as <unk> <unk> , from the <unk> <unk> , from the <unk> <unk> , and <unk> all those data together .
All those pictures are <unk> together , more than the <unk> of the parts .
You have a <unk> of the entire land that <unk> .
Think of this as a <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> on Earth .
It 's something that <unk> in complexity , you know , and the <unk> that <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> that <unk> <unk> with the use .
Their pictures are <unk> with <unk> <unk> from other people .
If somebody 's <unk> , you 're all these <unk> <unk> , my <unk> picture , my <unk> picture of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of all those data , and then , as a <unk> , using pictures of everybody , and have a social experience <unk> .
Of course , a <unk> of all of this is very <unk> <unk> of every interesting part of the land , <unk> not only <unk> <unk> and <unk> images and <unk> .
<unk> <unk> .
Chris Anderson : I realized that your software <unk> us to do is that your software <unk> us to do is that at some point , in the next years , all of all the photographs of anybody in the world will be <unk> together ?
<unk> : Yeah . What 's doing is actually <unk> .
It 's making <unk> , if you want , between images .
And it 's doing it in the <unk> of the images .
The thing becomes very interesting if you think about the <unk> <unk> information that many of these <unk> images .
As you do a research images on the web , you <unk> a <unk> and the <unk> page on the web has a lot of information about images .
Now , what happens if that picture is going on if that picture is that picture ?
So the amount of <unk> <unk> and the amount of <unk> that is really enormous . It 's a very huge <unk> . It 's a <unk> effect of the network .
CA : <unk> , it 's really incredible .
<unk> : I 'm going to tell you very much .
One of the main <unk> when you <unk> and one of the <unk> <unk> is the <unk> that we can live in in the wind , who <unk> the past <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
We think that <unk> <unk> <unk> still over the <unk> <unk> , or that the <unk> <unk> of <unk> are still <unk> <unk> <unk> , or <unk> , or <unk> , or <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , to remember the <unk> <unk> , to remember the <unk> <unk> , and that the idea that the world that the <unk> <unk> <unk> , but it 's <unk> <unk> , is a <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , but it 's a a <unk> <unk> ,
the <unk> of a particular <unk> of <unk> choices that our <unk> has done , well or <unk> , a lot of <unk> .
And , of course , all of the <unk> <unk> .
All of <unk> . All <unk> .
We 're <unk> to <unk> <unk> .
We have to <unk> the death of death , so we don 't <unk> it , if you 're <unk> --
We all have a art .
What <unk> is the particular <unk> of the song , the <unk> of <unk> <unk> every culture .
<unk> 't matter that are the <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> , or <unk> <unk> <unk> , or <unk> <unk> <unk> , or <unk> <unk> <unk> , or a <unk> in the heart of <unk> , or a <unk> in the heart of the <unk> .
He was my <unk> of the journey in the <unk> a month ago , or a <unk> <unk> of <unk> , on the <unk> , the <unk> , on the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , <unk> , on the <unk> ,
All these <unk> <unk> that there are other ways of <unk> other ways of <unk> , other ways of <unk> , other ways of <unk> in the world .
And , if you 're going to <unk> a minute , it 's a concept that can give you hope .
<unk> , <unk> of the world <unk> create a <unk> of life , and <unk> <unk> the planet is important for the <unk> of the planet , so as the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And you can think about this <unk> <unk> like a <unk> and you can <unk> the <unk> <unk> of all the <unk> of all the <unk> , dreams , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> ,
<unk> is the <unk> of humanity .
It 's the <unk> of what we 're and what we can be in how <unk> species .
And <unk> the <unk> was <unk> <unk> <unk> was successful to <unk> and <unk> <unk> much more quickly .
<unk> <unk> , for example , <unk> that 50 percent of all the species was or <unk> , because it 's <unk> , or -- in the <unk> <unk> -- or -- in the <unk> <unk> -- and you don 't even even even even <unk> -- that <unk> <unk> <unk> -- that diversity .
<unk> of all that is , of course , <unk> <unk> .
When you 're <unk> <unk> <unk> on this planet .
A language is not just a <unk> or a <unk> <unk> of a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
A language is the <unk> of human spirit .
It 's the middle with which <unk> of every culture comes in the world .
Every language is a forest of mind , a <unk> , a thought , a <unk> <unk> of <unk> .
And of those <unk> <unk> , as we 're sitting here in <unk> , at least half the <unk> of the children 's <unk> .
They don 't get <unk> to children , which means , less than <unk> , they 're already died .
What 's more <unk> of the <unk> of being <unk> by <unk> , of being the last to speak a language , of the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> , or <unk> <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> , or <unk> <unk> <unk> ,
This <unk> <unk> was a few of somebody in the world every two weeks : every two weeks , two weeks , a <unk> <unk> and it 's <unk> with it in the <unk> <unk> of a <unk> language .
And I know that somebody of you <unk> " <unk> is not better ?
The world doesn 't have a better place if you 're all the same language ? " <unk> , then we 're talking about <unk> . <unk> .
<unk> <unk> .
<unk> a <unk> thing means that they doesn 't talk to their language .
I 'd like to give you a journey to do a journey ,
a little journey in the <unk> to give you a <unk> of what we 're <unk> .
Many of us <unk> that when I say , " I 'm going to be a very different ways of <unk> .
<unk> for example , this <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , which <unk> <unk> <unk> , which <unk> to <unk> <unk> from the <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> .
It 's a <unk> that 's not able to <unk> the blue color <unk> because the <unk> <unk> is <unk> in the time of the <unk> <unk> .
They have a <unk> language and a <unk> rule , " <unk> <unk> , " <unk> <unk> , " you have to <unk> a different language .
And all this has <unk> in the past <unk> , though , is that in these <unk> families in which you talk six or seven <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> no <unk> .
They <unk> to hear and then <unk> to talk about it .
I think one of the most interesting <unk> with which I lived , the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , an incredible <unk> that had the first <unk> in <unk> .
In <unk> five <unk> have <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> .
They did <unk> by the top of photographs that <unk> them in <unk> that <unk> <unk> , <unk> that this <unk> of <unk> forest had never seen anything <unk> .
They <unk> the <unk> of the land , they <unk> to research a form or a <unk> , and they don 't <unk> , they <unk> that <unk> <unk> , and they <unk> the five <unk> with <unk> .
But <unk> not only <unk> the <unk> .
They <unk> <unk> .
<unk> percent of the <unk> <unk> was <unk> by their own .
We 're <unk> for eight <unk> and we found two cases of death and when we <unk> <unk> to know , they have <unk> that they died , and then they <unk> it <unk> it . They <unk> it <unk> it . They <unk> it <unk> it . They <unk> it .
<unk> were able to recognize the animal <unk> from 40 <unk> and <unk> the species .
I was <unk> a very interesting task , I was <unk> a very interesting task when my <unk> <unk> me if I wanted to go to <unk> <unk> with <unk> society <unk> <unk> and <unk> , and <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk>
To give a sense of <unk> , I should have to understand the <unk> culture and that <unk> is not <unk> .
It 's pretty a <unk> <unk> <unk> of the world .
Very interesting .
If you <unk> to <unk> the great <unk> of the world , what I <unk> ?
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , etc . .
A continent is always <unk> out , thinking that Africa <unk> doesn 't have <unk> <unk> . And instead , <unk> and <unk> is not another that the <unk> of these <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> .
What makes the <unk> is the <unk> between life and death .
So <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> can be <unk> by the <unk> <unk> , <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> to the <unk> of the live in the <unk> , it becomes the <unk> .
So , for this <unk> <unk> to say , " <unk> <unk> <unk> to talk about God .
We <unk> in <unk> and <unk> God . "
And the moment you 're <unk> , is the spirit that you can <unk> you , how do you can you <unk> it ?
So they <unk> these incredible events : <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a pretty strong <unk> of the power of mind when it 's <unk> <unk> <unk> .
I think the <unk> with the <unk> that I 've lived the most <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , in the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> that once on the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> on the <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> on the <unk> <unk> .
In a <unk> continent , this <unk> is never been <unk> by <unk> .
In <unk> , I 'm <unk> from a <unk> , but their <unk> is extraordinary .
<unk> are <unk> on the families at the families to three or four years , and they live <unk> in a world <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> for 18 years .
Two years of nine years <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
So , for all this time , they 're <unk> to values that their <unk> and <unk> their <unk> <unk> -- or just <unk> <unk> <unk> -- or to say the <unk> <unk> -- or to say the <unk> <unk> .
At the <unk> of this incredible <unk> , they 're <unk> <unk> and for the first time in their life , at age of 18 years , they see a <unk> . And in the moment of the first <unk> , when the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , everything they have been <unk> in theory is <unk> , and they 're going to be <unk> . <unk> : <unk> and <unk> <unk> . <unk> :
" <unk> ? I 'm going to say you .
It 's <unk> . Now it 's <unk> . "
They call it <unk> and they say that , <unk> <unk> , we 're the <unk> of the world .
This is extremely important .
When we think about <unk> and <unk> environment <unk> and the old <unk> <unk> , which is a <unk> concept in his <unk> <unk> , or maybe <unk> <unk> , or maybe <unk> <unk> , and we say that these <unk> are more <unk> to Earth .
<unk> <unk> are not <unk> <unk> .
There 's no space for these things in the <unk> <unk> of <unk> or <unk> <unk> , but <unk> , <unk> , but <unk> , with the time and to <unk> , they created a <unk> of the Earth <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , but on a <unk> <unk> <unk> . But it 's a human <unk> . It 's <unk> <unk> , because it 's human <unk> .
What does that mean ?
<unk> to say that a <unk> of the <unk> that the mountain is a <unk> <unk> that <unk> its <unk> <unk> is going to be a human <unk> , and it 's going to have a different relationship with the mountain or that place as a <unk> <unk> that <unk> a mountain is a <unk> <unk> <unk> to be <unk> .
which is the <unk> of a spirit or a <unk> <unk> is <unk> .
What 's interesting is the <unk> that <unk> the relationship between the <unk> and the natural world .
I grew up in the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to be <unk> .
So , that <unk> me a human being different from my friends who believe that <unk> are <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> that live in the <unk> of the world , <unk> that <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> .
If you start <unk> that these <unk> can actually create different , they start to understand some <unk> <unk> <unk> . We can start to understand some <unk> <unk> .
I <unk> this picture of <unk> in <unk> <unk> .
Maybe some of you have heard about <unk> , the most powerful <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
What makes the <unk> is not the potential of the <unk> potential of <unk> , but his <unk> . It 's <unk> by two <unk> .
From one side , this <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
<unk> the only <unk> <unk> a little <unk> that <unk> a little bit of the <unk> , but it 's <unk> with the <unk> of a <unk> of family <unk> said <unk> .
This <unk> <unk> <unk> , very similar to <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
If you 'll see the <unk> <unk> on the <unk> to the <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> that <unk> on the <unk> is a little bit like to be <unk> by a <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> on a <unk> of electricity . <unk> 't it doesn 't create a <unk> of the reality ; it doesn 't create the <unk> of the reality of the <unk> .
I often with my <unk> , Richard <unk> <unk> , <unk> man , the man who <unk> <unk> was <unk> , with his discovery of <unk> <unk> in the ' <unk> .
My <unk> is not <unk> these <unk> , because they 're <unk> like <unk> because if you 're <unk> <unk> .
It 's possible to <unk> it only if you 're <unk> with other <unk> <unk> .
Now , it 's the <unk> that are in this <unk> are <unk> of <unk> , the same kind of <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> . The question <unk> question : in a <unk> of <unk> <unk> species , like these <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> , like these <unk> <unk> <unk> .
We use the great <unk> of <unk> and <unk> , which can <unk> <unk> .
But if you 're going to <unk> , we 'll say , " <unk> <unk> us . "
What does that mean ?
This <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , who <unk> <unk> <unk> in the forest , and that <unk> <unk> in the forest , and that our eyes <unk> in the same species .
If the <unk> like <unk> their <unk> <unk> <unk> , " <unk> <unk> <unk> , " <unk> <unk> , " I said , " No . "
<unk> is : <unk> <unk> in a night of the moon <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> with a different <unk> .
With this <unk> is not <unk> , but it 's much more interesting than <unk> <unk> .
Now , [ <unk> <unk> the problem is that even the ones of us that have to heart <unk> <unk> , but in some way to <unk> the <unk> of the history of our world , about the real world , and <unk> .
In fact , the <unk> century , in 300 years , not <unk> <unk> for his <unk> or his <unk> <unk> , but rather like the <unk> was where we <unk> and we <unk> <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of diversity and <unk> of the planet . Now , the problem is not the change .
All the <unk> through the <unk> have been <unk> in a <unk> for new possibilities of life .
And the problem is not the technology .
<unk> <unk> don 't have <unk> to be <unk> when they put it out of the <unk> and <unk> like <unk> <unk> , as they <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
It 's not the change or technology that <unk> <unk> . It 's <unk> . It 's power .
<unk> <unk> .
And if you 're going to take a look at the world , that these are not <unk> <unk> to <unk> .
They 're <unk> creatures and <unk> <unk> out of the <unk> forces that go beyond their <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of <unk> <unk> --
a <unk> <unk> of <unk> , in <unk> <unk> , a <unk> that has lived in the forest to a generation ago , and now <unk> to <unk> the <unk> of <unk> , where you can see the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , which you can see the <unk> <unk> <unk> , where the <unk> <unk> , where the <unk> <unk> , where the <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , where the <unk> <unk> ,
We <unk> the <unk> with the <unk> <unk> to the forest .
Or , in the case of <unk> , are the diseases that are <unk> with the <unk> discovery of <unk> .
If you <unk> on the <unk> of the <unk> , where I 'm doing a lot of research , you 'll see the <unk> of <unk> politics .
As <unk> <unk> , <unk> physics of a <unk> , is <unk> <unk> to <unk> , but <unk> , the <unk> of the <unk> of life of a <unk> , not only , but <unk> <unk> <unk> in some <unk> , because it 's a part of <unk> , because it 's a part of the <unk> .
And you can 't understand the <unk> of the <unk> until you can 't be part of the beginning .
I have the <unk> miles from <unk> in the <unk> China , <unk> to <unk> with a young <unk> , but only they <unk> it with a young <unk> , but just <unk> it to <unk> it .
They <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> million people <unk> from the <unk> during the <unk> <unk> .
The father of this guy was <unk> to <unk> <unk> .
which means that it 's been <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> is <unk> with <unk> <unk> during the <unk> that <unk> <unk> in <unk> .
<unk> mother was <unk> and his <unk> was <unk> to be <unk> .
It 's been <unk> <unk> at the age of two years <unk> <unk> his <unk> <unk> because he didn 't have to live without him .
<unk> , who did the same , was <unk> in the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> a day <unk> a <unk> <unk> and , for this <unk> , was <unk> to <unk> work for seven years .
The pain of the <unk> can be <unk> , but the spirit of the <unk> <unk> is <unk> .
And then , everything <unk> to a choice .
<unk> to live in the world of <unk> or we want to <unk> the world of diversity ?
The great <unk> <unk> <unk> , before they were going to die , and he said that his biggest fear was that , in our <unk> <unk> <unk> of the world , not only <unk> the whole <unk> of human imagination to a <unk> of human imagination , but a day <unk> us from a <unk> <unk> <unk> that there were other possibility .
And it 's <unk> that our species is <unk> for <unk> years .
<unk> <unk> , which has given us to <unk> , which has <unk> us to <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> , <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> , <unk> <unk> , creating <unk> , creating <unk> <unk> , and we talk about <unk> years ago .
The <unk> world has <unk> <unk> <unk> .
That <unk> story I didn 't think we have the answers to all the challenges that we 're going to <unk> .
When these <unk> of the world is asked what they want to be human , <unk> with <unk> <unk> <unk> .
And it 's in these answers that we all <unk> the possibility of being what we are : a <unk> species , which has to <unk> a way that all the <unk> and all the <unk> can <unk> . And there are great great moments of <unk> .
I <unk> this picture on the <unk> <unk> of <unk> island , when I went to <unk> <unk> with <unk> <unk> , and this man , <unk> me , and this man , <unk> me , and this man , I 've got this wonderful story of his <unk> .
The <unk> government was not always <unk> with the <unk> <unk> and in the ' <unk> <unk> for our <unk> , we <unk> them in <unk> .
<unk> of this man <unk> <unk> .
<unk> , <unk> for his life , <unk> <unk> , and all his <unk> , and all his <unk> .
We wanted to know that the <unk> <unk> , <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
The <unk> of this man didn 't <unk> <unk> at night or <unk> <unk> .
It 's <unk> , you 're <unk> <unk> <unk> in skin <unk> and <unk> in your hand . When I did it <unk> , they <unk> it , <unk> it <unk> <unk> .
He <unk> <unk> on the <unk> of this <unk> <unk> , and when <unk> <unk> , he <unk> a dog .
He <unk> the dog and created a <unk> , with the <unk> <unk> has created a <unk> , he <unk> a <unk> , and it 's <unk> on the <unk> , <unk> in <unk> .
<unk> <unk> with anything ? [ <unk> ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] is the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> and all the <unk> <unk> of the world .
<unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> government <unk> to <unk> the total control of a <unk> area of <unk> <unk> <unk> .
It 's their new <unk> . It 's called <unk> .
It 's a <unk> <unk> . We <unk> all the <unk> resources .
One <unk> example of how a <unk> can <unk> with his <unk> .
And , to end , I think it 's pretty <unk> at least at least who 's been in these <unk> <unk> of the planet , <unk> that they 're not <unk> at all .
For somebody 's home is home .
<unk> <unk> of human imagination that <unk> to <unk> <unk> of the time . And for us all , dreams of these children , as the dreams of our children , they become part of the hope of the <unk> hope .
So , we 're <unk> <unk> , we 're <unk> <unk> that <unk> never <unk> .
<unk> that <unk> --
<unk> <unk> <unk> , they 're not <unk> , but we believe that stories can change the world , and maybe we 're the best <unk> to tell the stories of the world . Every month our <unk> <unk> <unk> million <unk> .
We <unk> <unk> our <unk> <unk> .
Our <unk> are <unk> by millions of people .
Our work is <unk> in <unk> to take our public places that <unk> from <unk> <unk> from which <unk> <unk> from <unk> , and they <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , once the <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> : the world 's <unk> in diversity , and we need to find a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in the diversity , and we need to find a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> world .
where the <unk> of all the <unk> can <unk> our <unk> <unk> .
Thank you .
I 'm going to talk about some things that I wrote in this book that you 've already heard and <unk> <unk> <unk> some <unk> , in the case you 've got it in the case you 've got it to be <unk> .
I 'd like to start with what I call " <unk> . "
<unk> <unk> of what ?
The <unk> <unk> of all the society <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> : " If we want to <unk> our <unk> of our citizens , " <unk> , " <unk> <unk> . "
The reason is , from one side , in fact that the freedom is in the same value , is <unk> , <unk> , <unk> for humans .
<unk> is the other is that if we 're <unk> , each of us can do that to do everything that <unk> our <unk> , without no one that <unk> our <unk> .
The way to <unk> the <unk> is <unk> .
<unk> people have , more choices , and they 're more <unk> , and it 's <unk> , more , is their <unk> .
This , <unk> , it 's so <unk> <unk> in society that no one <unk> <unk> in <unk> .
And it 's also <unk> <unk> in our lives .
I 'm going to show you some examples of what progress is possible .
This is my <unk> . It 's not particularly big .
I <unk> a simple note about <unk> to <unk> .
In my <unk> , there are <unk> , without <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that you can buy for a huge number of <unk> in the <unk> <unk> that no <unk> <unk> is <unk> of your <unk> .
That 's what the <unk> .
Then you go to the <unk> <unk> for <unk> : <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
And in this single <unk> store , there 's a big number of <unk> <unk> .
We can make six million different <unk> using the <unk> that there are in a only store .
<unk> <unk> that there is <unk> .
<unk> <unk> : the world 's world 's <unk> .
<unk> , when I was a child , they could get all the services <unk> , to <unk> that they were <unk> by <unk> <unk> .
They <unk> the phone , you 're not <unk> .
One of that , <unk> , was that the phone never <unk> .
These days , they went .
We have a <unk> <unk> almost <unk> , especially between the phones .
Here 's the <unk> of the future .
My <unk> is that in a half , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> for <unk> <unk> .
If you don 't have the <unk> in the store under the house , you 're very <unk> that soon <unk> .
And what the end is happening is that people <unk> into the <unk> and does this question . And you know , is the answer ? The answer is " No . "
It 's not able to buy a cell phone that doesn 't face things .
So , in other ways of life that are much more important than <unk> , they 're <unk> the same <unk> of choices .
<unk> <unk> : It doesn 't take it from the United States that you 're going to <unk> <unk> you have to do .
Instead , <unk> from the <unk> , and the <unk> says , " OK , " Well , we could do it , or <unk> , " <unk> , " <unk> <unk> these <unk> , and these <unk> . What you want to do ? "
You <unk> : You 're going to do it ? "
And the <unk> says , " <unk> these <unk> and these <unk> , and <unk> has these <unk> and <unk> these <unk> . "
" What do you want to do ? "
And you 're going to say , " <unk> if she was me , what do ? "
And the <unk> : " But I 'm not her . "
The result we call it " <unk> " , " <unk> , " <unk> that makes it seem like a beautiful thing .
But it 's not a <unk> the weight and <unk> of <unk> to take decisions from somebody who knows something knows something , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and so not in <unk> -- and so not in <unk> <unk> to take it in <unk> for <unk> to take decisions .
There 's a huge <unk> of <unk> products , <unk> people like me and you , that if you think about it has no sense , because we can 't think about it doesn 't <unk> .
But if we can 't <unk> , why do we <unk> them ?
The answer is that they want to <unk> the <unk> to <unk> <unk> .
<unk> of how to <unk> is a <unk> of <unk> is a question of choice , like , you see in this <unk> , " We don 't want to <unk> . We don 't want to <unk> <unk> . We don 't want to <unk> .
And we can <unk> how many times we <unk> .
The <unk> means that every <unk> , you have to <unk> , you have to decide that kind of person want to be .
<unk> to family and <unk> , a <unk> time , <unk> almost for anyone , was that <unk> <unk> as as as possible , and you could <unk> <unk> children .
The only only choice was with who , not when , and even what to do after .
<unk> , all of it 's really to play .
They 're going to <unk> <unk> , and they <unk> their 20 percent less than a time .
And because they 're not <unk> , because they 're less <unk> .
But why they 're <unk> , <unk> to <unk> , " <unk> or not ? <unk> <unk> or not ? "
" <unk> <unk> <unk> later ? I have to think about children or to career ? "
They 're <unk> <unk> .
And they try to answer these questions , even if this <unk> doesn 't <unk> the <unk> that <unk> and not to get a beautiful <unk> to my <unk> .
And they really have to do that . I 'm important questions .
Now , the work : we 're <unk> , like <unk> <unk> , because the technology allows us to work every minute , every day , from every day of the planet , <unk> that <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , there is a <unk> , and I 'm not going to say no one which is where the <unk> works .
I 'm not going to tell you , because I want to use it .
What does , this incredible choice of choice that we have about work ? It 's that we need to decide , <unk> in every moment , if we have to work or no .
We can go to see our son to <unk> , with the phone in a <unk> , <unk> in the other , and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , on the <unk> .
And if I 'm all <unk> , every minute that we see our son <unk> <unk> , we 're also <unk> , " I 'm going to answer this called ? "
" I have to <unk> this <unk> ? I have to <unk> this letter ? "
And even when the answer is , " it 's " no , " everything makes the experience of your son very different than that would be in other conditions .
So , from any part of any <unk> , things , little and great things , <unk> materials and <unk> , life is a question of choices .
So , one the world was this : <unk> , there were some possibility , but it was not a question .
The world today today is , <unk> <unk> is : " It 's a <unk> thing , or <unk> ? "
The answer is <unk> .
<unk> <unk> them all , so I 'm going to talk about the <unk> .
We 're going to be two effects of people on people .
The first , <unk> , is that it makes <unk> <unk> .
With many <unk> of the <unk> , it becomes very difficult to do .
I 'm going to give you a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
A <unk> my <unk> has had access to the data , <unk> society <unk> , with about a million <unk> <unk> in different <unk> .
What she 's found her is that for every 10 solutions that are <unk> in more , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
With 50 <unk> <unk> , there is 10 percent less than <unk> when they 're available to <unk> . Why they 're available . Why ?
Because with 50 <unk> <unk> , is <unk> hard to decide , and <unk> , and <unk> is <unk> to <unk> .
And in <unk> , and again , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and of course , <unk> , and of course , <unk> , and of course , <unk> , and of course , of course , <unk> , and of course , of course , <unk> , and of course , of course , <unk> , and of course , of course , <unk> , and of course , <unk> , and of course , of course , and of course , <unk> , <unk> , and of course , <unk> , <unk> , and
<unk> that doesn 't mean that these <unk> <unk> <unk> food for <unk> <unk> , because they don 't want to say that the decision is so <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> of work .
They 're not <unk> , they 're <unk> until five <unk> <unk> for a year <unk> of work , which would be very well <unk> .
So the <unk> is a <unk> of <unk> choices .
And I think the world like this .
" And to end , to <unk> : <unk> , <unk> or <unk> ? "
They <unk> to take the right decision , if it 's for <unk> , right ?
You don 't want to choose the bottom , and you 're going to <unk> the wrong .
So this is the first effect . The second is that even if we can <unk> <unk> <unk> and make a choice , at the end , we 're less <unk> by the result of how to <unk> them .
And this for several reasons .
One of these is that with many <unk> of which you 're going to have a <unk> and it 's not <unk> , is easy to imagine that it 's better . And what 's what 's going on is that <unk> <unk> <unk> us to <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> ,
So , when it was a <unk> decision .
<unk> is <unk> , it 's easier to <unk> any <unk> <unk> ,
<unk> , there is what <unk> call <unk> .
Dan <unk> has <unk> very good <unk> like the value that we give things <unk> from what we <unk> .
<unk> , when there are many <unk> , is easy to <unk> the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> and be less <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> and being less <unk> .
Here 's a example . I 'm going to <unk> with all the <unk> of New York .
But it 's what you probably <unk> .
There 's this <unk> to <unk> .
A <unk> place .
<unk> <unk> . <unk> day . It 's all about them .
<unk> <unk> . But what he thinks is , " Well , <unk> , it 's <unk> . "
" All my <unk> <unk> are on the <unk> . "
" <unk> <unk> <unk> right to the house . "
And it <unk> two weeks from the idea that 's <unk> -- every day -- the <unk> <unk> where it wants .
The <unk> <unk> for what we have , even when the choice was <unk> .
And the most <unk> we have <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> on the <unk> <unk> on how to <unk> .
Here 's another example .
This <unk> tells us a lot of things .
It 's about the moment , and maybe in the <unk> of living <unk> .
But the most important thing you 're going to <unk> , you 're going to <unk> , you 're going to <unk> .
The things that they don 't have a lot of <unk> that can make less <unk> what we do .
<unk> <unk> : <unk> <unk> .
I tried it on my skin <unk> a new couple of <unk> .
They 're almost always <unk> .
They had the <unk> of a kind , they <unk> them and <unk> <unk> , they were <unk> , only after <unk> , they were <unk> , only after <unk> a lot of times , they <unk> to go .
So , I started <unk> a couple of when the <unk> were <unk> , and I said , " I need a couple of <unk> , this is my <unk> . "
The <unk> said , " <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> ? "
<unk> <unk> or <unk> ? " <unk> , " <unk> , " or " <unk> , " <unk> , " or " <unk> , " <unk> , " or " <unk> ? "
" <unk> <unk> ? "
" <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> or <unk> ? <unk> <unk> <unk> -- " <unk> <unk> . "
I was <unk> , and after a little bit I was able to say , " I want the guy -- that was the only kind of -- that was a <unk> <unk> me , so for a <unk> <unk> <unk> , and then <unk> <unk> , with the best <unk> , <unk> , with the best <unk> that I had ever had .
It was <unk> . With all that choice I had <unk> the best .
But I 'm going to be worse .
Why ? I wrote a book for <unk> .
The reason I was <unk> with all that choice is that with all my <unk> <unk> were <unk> , <unk> to be <unk> .
I had <unk> <unk> . I didn 't know anything I was <unk> when I was just a kind , but when I was going to go to a different kind of <unk> , at least a kind of being perfect .
What I had <unk> was good , but not perfect .
After they had <unk> to <unk> the <unk> with what I was <unk> in <unk> .
<unk> <unk> in life , people don 't do <unk> the <unk> that these have <unk> than <unk> <unk> .
And this <unk> less <unk> , even when the results are good .
<unk> in the world of the <unk> world if you 're <unk> .
Because if you 're <unk> , I 'm not talking about what I 'm talking about .
The <unk> truth in this .
" He was better when he was <unk> , " The reason he was <unk> , " The reason he was <unk> as as he was still <unk> <unk> .
<unk> , in the world that we live -- <unk> , <unk> citizens with <unk> <unk> -- the <unk> that we can <unk> is that the <unk> of the <unk> .
You never <unk> <unk> because your <unk> , my <unk> , you 're <unk> .
The <unk> of happiness -- what you 're here -- is , " <unk> <unk> , " Yes , " , " Yeah , you want . "
I mean -- little <unk> moment -- that I 'm really <unk> and my wife is really <unk> .
I couldn 't have to do better , I 'm not <unk> .
But <unk> is not a <unk> thing .
<unk> , a <unk> of buy a couple of <unk> <unk> when there is just that kind of <unk> is that when you 're not <unk> , and you 'll <unk> you , " Why ? "
" Who is <unk> ? " <unk> is <unk> .
The world is <unk> . What I could you do it ?
When there are hundreds of <unk> <unk> , and you 're going to <unk> them , and you 'll <unk> you who is the <unk> , it 's <unk> <unk> that you 're .
We could have it better .
With hundreds of <unk> available , there are not <unk> for <unk> .
So , when people take decisions , even though , even though , they <unk> <unk> and they <unk> their own .
In the last years , the <unk> is <unk> in the <unk> world .
I think a <unk> <unk> -- not the only , but important -- of this <unk> of <unk> is that people have experiences because the <unk> are too <unk> .
And when they have to <unk> this situation they think that the <unk> is .
So the final result is that in general , we 're better , but we 'll <unk> it .
Let me tell you .
This is the <unk> , what we all take for good and it 's completely <unk> . It 's not true .
There 's no <unk> that a little bit of choice is better than <unk> , but from this doesn 't <unk> that much better than a little bit better .
There 's a <unk> value , <unk> . I don 't know what it is .
But I 'm sure we 've got a piece of a piece of the level that <unk> our life .
Now , from a <unk> <unk> -- I 'm almost <unk> -- I 'm going to be <unk> -- from the <unk> is <unk> .
What it allows all this choice in society is the <unk> material .
There are a lot of places in the world , and you 're <unk> <unk> , where the problem is not <unk> choice .
The problem is that they 're too <unk> .
So the <unk> I 'm talking about is a <unk> <unk> of <unk> , <unk> society .
And what <unk> does <unk> and <unk> is this : <unk> <unk> <unk> you talked about yesterday of how <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> . It 's a <unk> of money . It 's a <unk> of money .
I mean that these choices , <unk> and <unk> , is not that they 're just <unk> .
They 're <unk> <unk> .
They do it worse .
If you have a little bit about what our society will <unk> choice was <unk> in those people have too few people , not only their life , but also , even our life .
This is what <unk> call a <unk> <unk> .
A <unk> of income is good at all -- not only to the poor -- because of this choice in <unk> that <unk> us .
So , to <unk> , you can actually actually be everything you want to --
<unk> , people , <unk> , " But what do that fish ? "
" It 's <unk> that you can 't make anything in a <unk> of glass . "
" A <unk> <unk> , a <unk> view of the world --
and I <unk> it so , at the beginning .
But then , <unk> , I realized that fish knows what the long <unk> knows .
Because the reality of <unk> is that if you <unk> the <unk> , you know , " <unk> , " <unk> <unk> . " It 's <unk> . It 's <unk> . It 's <unk> .
If you <unk> the <unk> that everything we could <unk> the <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , and <unk> the <unk> .
They all need a <unk> .
This is almost too <unk> , maybe even for the fish , and it 's <unk> for us .
But the <unk> of some <unk> is a <unk> for <unk> and <unk> , for <unk> .
Thank you very much .
