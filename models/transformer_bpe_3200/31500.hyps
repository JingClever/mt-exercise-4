And last year , I showed these demonstrate demonstrate that the arctic calotter , which for almost three million years has had the size of 48 , the size of 48 , the size of the 48 , is remarkable of 40 percent .
But this subvaluable to gravity the gravity of the problem because it doesn 't show the shore of the ice .
The arctic glacial calotter is , in a sense , the clear heart of global climate system .
It 's expanded up and retreats .
The next slide is going to be a rapidly carrelated to the advvocate over the last 25 years .
Space aces are signed in red .
You see , they expand until the blue wall .
That 's the ice in winter , which is rats of summer .
You can see that cosidm , at five years or more , is like blood , is like blood , which is like blood , which is like blood , which is like blood , which is like blood , which is like blood , which is like blood , which is like blood , or more , is like blood , which is like blood , you can see that cosid
In 25 years , it 's past , at the way .
This is a problem because the heat the whole thing is the glaciated the ground around the ocean where there are huge carbon where there are huge carbon carbon congelated that , the leaving of the microbes .
It turns out to the totality of the atmospherical pollution , the amount of of global warming could double-raged , overcome this point of not .
In some little deep in Alaska , a methane of the methane , is already rebling from water .
The professor Katey Walter in the University of Alaska 's fairly a fent team in a team of a fent last horrian .
Video : Wow ! Al Gore : Wow ! The question is if we 're going to be .
A reason is that this termicity exchange Groenland from the northermal .
This is a glacial regime .
The brought hadn 't reached .
This is the Kangerlussuaq , in the southwest of the Groenland .
If you want to know how to the sea level for the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice sea level for the shelter .
These current current are increasing .
At the other side of the planet : Antarctica , the largest block of the planet .
The last month scientists have dichieve that the pathway is in the negative , and the Antarctica , which pogams on some islands , is particularly rapidly rapid in the mouseholds .
It 's about six feet feet of the acque , like Groenland .
You see the Himalaya , the third largely block of ice , you see new laghi , which few years ago , it 's a glacier .
40 percent of the world population is getting half of the world 's water from that melt water .
Sulle Ande : this glacier is the source of water source .
The landed is increased .
But when he diminues it comes , the same way on the potable water .
In California , the newnow on Sierra Nevada is decreased 40 percent .
Onnirics are in crisis .
The predictions , like you read , are grabs .
The growth in the world leads to a remarkable increase .
The environmental disaster disaster , is increasing out of the normal and without previous .
Four times more numheroes in the last 30 years than the previous 75 .
This is a whole insustainable way .
If you look at it in the context of the context .
In the last five years we 've added 70 million tons of CO2 every 24 hours -- 25 million tons in the ocean every day .
Look at the Eastern Pacific , from the Americas , towards the Eastern Pacific , where there 's a radical inor obsial parts , where there is a radical impoverty in the ocean .
The major causes global warming , together to deforestation , which is 20 percent , is the fossil fuels .
Or is a problem , and the carbon is even worse .
The United States is one of the two more emissions , together to China .
And it proposing to build a lot of other carbon carbon .
But we 're seeing a direction change .
These are the anullated projects in the last few years and some green proposals of alternative .
Everything , there 's a political lower in our country .
The carbon industry and the oil have spent 250 million dollars in the last year to promote carbon , which is a oxide .
And that I 'd remember something --
Natal Tennessee , where I live , there was a 3.8 billion gallons of 3.8 billion gallons of carbon .
Maybe you 've seen in the news .
This is the second biggest flow of last flow in America .
It happened around Natale .
The Nalization of one of the carbon industry is this .
Video : I 've got the carbonaio is a kind of allegro and happy .
It 's abundant here in America , and grow our economy .
Frosty the carbonaio is more and clean .
It 's good price , adorable and the work keep the stypend standing .
Al Gore : At here 's a lot of West Virginia .
The biggest mineral society on the mountains is Massey Coal . This is his administrator .
Video : Don Blankenship : Sark Al Gore , Nancy Pelious , Harry Re-- they don 't know what they 're talking about .
Al Gore : So the Alleance for the Clima has two campaign .
This is one of them , one part .
Video : Acore : Acy COOALergy , we see climate change as a sery to our business .
So , our priority is to invest a lot of money in a commercial effort to make public and confused it on the carbon .
In fact , carbon is not sporite .
We think it 's clean -- it 's also a good profur .
So , not preocupatites of climate change .
Let me do it .
Video : Acore : Carbone 's 's heard a lot of it .
So let 's take a turn into a snail in a structure to the sweet of sleeping carbon .
Straordinary ! The machines are a little rainer , but this is the sound of the puly-lights technology .
The carbon consumption is between the main causes of global warming , but the remarkable technology of the clean that you see changes everything .
You look at a look , this is the hataten carbon technology .
Al Gore : Finally , the positive positive is conduct to the economic issue and the national security .
Video : The America is in crisis ; the economy , national security , national security crisis .
The golles that lines all , our dependence from fossil fuels , like the fossil fuel , like the sporite and oil .
Now , but , there 's a new , audace solution to use it .
Repower : 100 percent of clean energy , in 10 years .
A plan to put America to work , make more sure , and help us make more sure , and help us stop the global warming .
So , a solution that bees to solve our problems .
Repower . Scoprite more .
Al Gore : This is the last .
Video : Comment : It 's about resolving energy to America .
One of the fastest ways of getting fastest ways to independence that killing our planet .
So , it 's the future is here . Vent , a new energy network .
Nump Novi investment for the ben jobs for the work , very much .
Repower America . It 's time to be realists .
Al Gore : A old African proverbio says , " If you want to go fast , go to fast , go to fast .
If you want to go away , go together . "
We have to go away , fast .
Thank you very much .
LHC last year at TED , I introduction at TED ,
And promise to rate to get back to how the machine .
So here I did . And for the ones that the other time there was no , LHC is the biggest scientific experiment ever -- 27 kilometers of circuit .
Her task is to reconstructions that were at least than a billion billion on the universe -- until 600 million times a second .
All of that is just ambitious .
This is the Ginevra .
We 're doing this min-Big Bang in the detectors .
This is what it 's working on . It 's called ATLAS -- is about 44 feet .
This is an ATLAS picture in building , so you can see proportions .
Ten september last year , we have accesum the machine for the first time .
And this picture was taken by ATLAS .
It was because of immense festeggams in control .
It 's an image of particles that had done all the whole LHC , entering in collision , in collision , with one part of the LHC , and spread particles inside the detector .
In other words , when we see that picture , when we saw that picture , we did the machine , we did the machine , which is a great writing .
I don 't know if it was this exultate more or this , when somebody went on to Google and saw the initial page was this .
That means we have had a cultural impact beyond .
At a week later , there was a problem with the machine , just had to these files here -- these files here -- these files here .
These files are 13,000 ampant when the machine is the power of the power of power of power .
Now , technical technical between you are looking at the files and say , " It 's not true . I 'm too very subtle . "
And they can do it because when they 're very co-called the superconvicts .
So at least 271 degrees , at least 271 degrees , at that time in the space between stars , these are going to bring that current .
In one of the giunture of the magneti magneti in the LHC , there was a fect of fabrication .
So the file surgeon , and the 13,000 prints suddenly met , and the 13,000 prints .
This was the result .
Now , this is even more impressive if you think that these weighs more than 20 tons , and you 're moved from about 30 centimeters .
They 're damage 50 magnets .
We had to take them , what we did .
We represent them and fixed them .
They 're coming back all on their place place underground .
By the end of the march is going to be again integral .
We 're going to accurate it , and we expect to get the data or bunch or bluly , and we 're going to keep that that are the morning in the universe .
Now , of course , in a certain way , these accidents reach the debate on the value of science and engineering in front of science and engineering in front . It 's easy to rear .
I think the fact that it 's so hard , the fact that it 's the value of things like LHC .
I want to end with the words of a English scientist , Humphrey Davy , which , I guess , in a defense of the inuseful experiments of his pupile , his pupile was Michael Faraday , said , " Nient is so dangerous for the progress of the human mind that the rent that the science is definitive to be there are no sticer-in-class of nature 's 's completely . "
Thank you .
I want to start asking you to rethink of when children , you play with the morning in the morning .
While you understand how to reach them and to move them , take them and move them , and get them , learn , and you know , learn how to think and solve problems with space , and by spatial relationship .
The spatial reasoning is deeply connected to the way we understand a lot of the world around us .
So , from the inspired information ual , we can focus an inspired , with my physical consultant , and my collaborator Jeevan Kalanithi , I started asking , " And if we use a computer , instead of having the cursor of mor multi-polpastrer that moves on a desktop of the Clpastrer that moves on a desktop of the information with both hands , with both your hands ,
and how do it to our pleasure ?
The question was interesting , we decided to explore the answer , building Siftable .
In a few words , a Siftable interactive is a great interactive computer as a biscoothing .
In a few words , a Siftable interactive is a great interactive computer as a biscoothing .
You can move with their hand , can " see " between them , " You know , " You know their movement and they have a screen and a wireless wireless .
But most importantly , I 'm physical objects , like the morning , can just move them to simply grandchildren .
Siftable is the example of a new ecosystem of tools to manipulate digital information .
And as they become more physical , achieves of the movement , other , and as they become more physical , conscious of motion , of other , how we move them , we can explore new and fun , we can explore new and fun and fun .
I 'm going to start with some simple example .
This Siftable is configured to show of video : if you 're going to stop the video rotable , the video road road like this , if you 're going to stop on the other side .
These interactive portraits is conscious reaction of other other .
If you face them , they 're interested in what they 're around .
If they 're surrounded , they can see it a little bit .
If they 're surrounded , they can see it a little bit .
They also great-like movement and inclination .
We then realized that one of the most implications of the interaction was able to use common managed to use common data , to example , " a color like it was a liquid .
In this case , we have three Siftable as a buck buck and I can use them to figuring color in the central , where you mix .
and I can use them to pay for the color in the central , where they 're mischieve .
We 're too too , we can put a little place .
There are also beautiful possibility of learning , like language , and mathematics , and logic games where people can prove things very quickly , and see the results results .
Now , I 'm --
This is a Fibonaccount that I do with a program of equations .
Here we have a words that 's in half of the Scarabeer and Boble .
Pratically , at every turn-range , you get a letter on every Siftable , Pratically , to every turnal Siftable , and as you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you 're controlling to a dictionary .
Then , after about 30 seconds remisses , and you have a new lecket and new chance to try .
Thank you .
Here 's the children came to the Media Lab , I did so I tried them and I went to a video .
They 're like that . They 're very pleasant .
And one of the interesting things of this kind of application is that you don 't have to give people a lot of education .
You 've got to say , " " " " " " and they know exactly what to do .
Here 's the other people try it .
This is our younger tester 's younger , there on the right .
It just wanted to stop them .
They just were bronceases , for him .
Now , this is an application of an interactive cardboard .
We wanted to build a tool for the apprentice of Lui is Felix .
It can put the characters in the scene , lifting the Siftable to them .
It can put the characters in the scene , lifting the Siftable to them .
So , it 's doing the sun .
Video : The sun is source .
David Merrill : Now , she took a tretor in the scene .
Video : The arange arange .
Bel work ! Yeah !
So , by the Siftable and put the neighbors can get the characters --
Video : Bau !
-- inventing your story .
Video : Hi !
DM : It 's a story with the open , and it can decide him like it .
DM : It 's a story with the open , and it can decide him like it .
Video : From , that all .
DM : The last example I have the time of showing you is a tool , made of recent , to samamamamamamamong and execececect-music .
It 's a tool , made of recent , to trampioning and to make music .
Siftable here aging sound as the bass and the bacteria .
Every one of these has four different variations , and you can choose which use .
You can also put these sound in a sequence to get your pleasure .
And it just to move it by making a sunny sound and a sequence . "
These are actually able of the vial , like the reverberbal and the filter .
You attacks to a particular particular sound and then fix for them .
And then there are the general effectively , as time and volume , which is going to be able to sequence .
Let 's look at how it works .
Video : We 're going to start putting a two-Siftable in two Siftable , we 're going to put it in a series , we add , add , we add to the other basic .
Now I put a baseline .
Video : DM : Now , I add percussions --
Video : DM : And I 'll put the bacteria , so I can control the effect from the alive .
Video : I can be able to recognize the whole sequence time from one side or another .
Video : DM : And now I 'm going to add the bottom to give more expression .
Video : I can recombine the sequence to the sequence . "
So I don 't have to plan it before , but I can improvisit , make it longer or corner .
And now , finally , I can spring the whole sequence of the Siftable on the left , the Siftable .
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is to build new mo-sil-miles more and more sounds like our brain and body .
And today , I 've had time to show you one of the results of this path , and also some chance we try to bring out of the lab .
The concept I want to transmit is coming up this new generation of designed objects to interact with digital media media , that will take information in our world in the way we want .
Thank you very much .
I don 't see the time I 'm talking to all of you .
I 'm a writer .
I 'm going to take books is my profession , but it 's more than this , obviously .
It 's also love and the fascination of my life .
And I don 't expect that it can change .
But , I said , something particular happened to my life and my career , which has led me to wealthy the whole relationship with this work .
The particular thing is I have recently written this book , this whowy called " Mangia , " Ama , " Ama , " Ama , " Ama , " Ama , " Ama , " Ama , " Ama , " Am , " Ama , " Am . " And the interational .
And the result is that everywhere is is going to be convicted .
Really -- you know , convicted !
They 're going to be all worried and they say , " You don 't have it afraid to do better ?
You don 't care of continuing to write for all life without being able to create a book that could important to someone ? "
that could be importance to someone ? "
It 's ruring , you know .
But it could go worse , except that I remember that over 20 years ago , when I started saying to people -- I was a writing writing -- I wanted to be a writing writing .
I was going to injuried to the same reaction that was a fear .
And people said , " Don 't I could not do succeeded ?
Do you don 't care that the ulife-killed you ?
Do you don 't care about making this wearing for all life without anything to come up and dying on a cumulation of the infrants with the mouth of behind the motion of love with the moth of moth ,
So , you know .
The answer -- the short answer to all these questions is , " Yes . "
Yeah , I 'm afraid of all those things .
I 've always got afraid .
And I 'm afraid of many other things that people can 't inguess .
Like the algae and other things .
But , as much as I was writing what I thought and I asked a few of course is why ?
Is it rational ?
It 's logical that anyone should wait to be slowed by a job that you hear .
But what is this particular is in the creative impress that makes us nervous health mental , and it 's about the mental health , in one way that other careers don 't do ?
How father my father , for example , he was a chemical engineer and I remember one time in his 40 years of activity in his 40 years of activity that was asked if he was afraid to be engineer ?
There was never -- that block of engineer John , how do it ?
It didn 't work like that , you know ?
Onestly , chemical engineers like group don 't have certainly , in the centuries , guadvanced the reputation of being alcofied maniaces .
We have writers , we have enough this reputation , and not just writers , but creativity of every kind , we have this reputation of being enormous .
And it 's not something else that look at the triad of deaths of the deaths of creative magnificments that , only in the 20th century , they die young people .
And the ones that don 't have been suicide to be really disfacing from their dunes .
Norman Mailer , before he died , in the last interview said , " Every my book killed me a little more " an extraordinary affermation about the work of your life .
But we don 't beat the boy when we heard that that , because we 've heard these things so long that somehow we have completely interiorized and accepted the notion that creativity and suffering the notion that creativity and suffering are in some way .
And the question I want to take to everywhere today is , are you agree with this idea ?
You 're going to do this thing -- because even the watching a hundred distance to me not well for this support .
I think it 's hated .
And I think it 's dangerous and I don 't want to see the perpetuated in the next century .
I think it 's better encouraging our big minds to live .
And I certainly know that , in my case -- in my situation -- it would be very dangerous to start fuse to fix the circumstances that are in my career .
It 's really -- you look at it 's pretty young , I 've got about 40 years .
I still have about four work decades .
And it 's very likely that whatever I 'm going to be judged by the world like the work that was going to come out of my last book .
I 'm slavery because we 're all more or less friends here -- it 's likely that my great successful is my behind .
Oh , Gesus , what I thought !
You know this is the kind of thinking that leads a person to start to drink gin in the nine in the morning and I don 't want to do it .
I 'm going to keep doing this work that we love .
So , the question becomes , how ?
And so I think , after a lot of reflections , that the way to keep writing is to create a psychologic constructed protective , OK ?
I have to find some way to find a safety distance between me , I 'm writing , and my natural anxial about what the reaction is writing that , it 's going to do it , and as I was trying to figure out how to start doing it , and try and find other society to see if they could have better ideas and more healthy and sane and more healthy .
about how to help people creative manage inerent risks of creative emotional risks of creativity .
And that research took me to the Grek and ancient Rome .
I 'm giving it because I 'm coming in in the circle and then it comes back .
In the ancient Grek and ancient Rome -- people didn 't seem to believe that creativity came from men , OK ?
It thought creativity was this rehealthy , and they 're selling to come from men from a few distant and unknown , for distant distant reasons , and unknown for distances .
The greatest reef the waters of creativity , " demon creativity " demand . "
Socrate , wonderful , he believed to have a hand-elareas as as a far away .
The Roomes were the same idea , but they called the species of spirit without a genius .
That 's great , because the Roands didn 't think a genius was somebody who really really was somebody genius .
They believe that a genius was this kind of divine , which had literally believed in the walls of an artist study , a little bit like the elpho Dobby , and that came out to assisting the bate job of the artist and models the result of that work .
Extional -- here 's the distance of which I talk -- that psychologic construction that protected you from your job .
And everybody knew it was how it worked , right ?
So the anti-artists were protected to things , like , too much , like the too too narcible , right ?
If your work was exceptional , you couldn 't take the whole whole deserve , everybody knew that you were helped by this incorporate genius .
If your work failure , it wasn 't your whole hit , right ?
Everybody knew it was your genius to be a unable .
And so people han conceieived creativity in the West for a long time .
Then the Rinascement came and everything changed , and the whole whole thing was changing , and we got the human being in the middle of the universe over the middle of the universe over and mysteries and no longer space to make the writing .
This was the principle of humans and rational people started thinking about creativity came out of crecreative self-completely hydividness .
And for the first time in history , you start to refer to this or artist as a genius of a genius .
And I have to tell you , I think it was a big mistake .
I think I allow someone , a simple person to believe that they 're like a recipient like the source , the essence and the source of all the mysteries , creativity and inknowable and ethern is a very large file to give to the fragile of human psychology .
It 's like to ask someone to ingoiate the sun .
Deform and destoration completely the ego and creates all these these ingestishes on performance .
And I think it 's been this pressure that they have been destroyed in the 500 years .
And , if this is true , and I think it 's , the question becomes , and now ?
Can we do it ?
Maybe I got to go back to a more ancient understanding of human relationship and creative mystery .
Or maybe not .
Maybe we can 't sing 500 years of rational thinking about 18 minutes in a dear talk .
And there 's probably people in the audience that would have a legitimate scientific , in the notion of , you know , they do that people spend in people are doing the next facing people in their projects .
I 'm not really convince you all about this thing .
But the question I want to take is -- why isn 't not ?
Why don 't I think that way ?
Because it 's more of anything else I ever heard about to explain the exabove impreveals of the creative process .
A process that , as anyone who ever attempt to do something -- so , basically , everybody here -- you know , you don 't know rationally .
And , in fact , it can sometimes seem completely paranormous .
I did this meeting recently with the Ruth Stone , who has now 90 years , but that was a poetter for all life and said that in his childhood in the rural Virginia , worked out in the rural Virginia , and he felt , when a poetry poem .
He said that was like a fragherous air tracy .
And that was rotolling to her from the landscape .
He felt that , because he was to tremendous , because he was going down under her feet .
He knew I had one thing to do that point and was , words her , " Would like a match . "
And it 's going to hand-home and it was sweet , and it shouldn 't have to get a piece of paper and a match , and a matite enough , and a math , and the granded , collect it .
Sometimes he couldn 't be enough enough , so it 's fast and correcves and correcves without able to get to home and the rotolar her lost her back and she loved and he would continue to rot through the landscape , looking for , like she said , " another poet . "
Then there were those times -- this piece never deal with it -- there was some moments where the was almost losing , OK ?
So , he was running home and he was trying to get the card through , and he was looking for the paper in while he was going , and then he said , " which was like if he was going , like , if he was going to fit with the other hand and the steffed .
He had the poem from the tail and remamain his body and transcitten on the page .
And in these cases , the poem would have been presented on the perfect page and the contrary , as the last word at the first .
So when I heard it -- I was crazy , it 's exactly the same same thing my creative process .
Not all my creative process -- I 'm not a convict !
I 'm a mule , and my way to work is ; you know , wake up to the same horarian every day and play and play on the gotten over .
But even I , in my aggin , I 've been striped against that thing , sometimes .
And I guess that even many of you the han did .
You know , even though the job and ideas came to me from a certain certain source , I could not know .
And what is this thing ?
And how do we relate to it in a way that we don 't have the head , but , rather , what does it remain san ?
As I 'm about , the best example of the contemporary example I have is the musician , Tom Waits , which I 've been a few years ago for a newspaper newspaper .
We were talking about this , and you know , Tom , for the majority of life is the incarnation of the artist tomented in contemporary , trying to control , manage , dominating these species of impulses .
But then he invite , he got calculated , and one day while she was driving on a Los Angeles , and he changed it for him .
He was going to fast and everything with this little sent of melody , which is in his head as the inspiration , and it 's going to get it out , and the desider , and the desider , and the desidera , but it doesn 't know how to take it .
It 's not a paper , it 's not a pitch , it 's not a math , it 's got no regier .
So it starts to hear this species of old anxiety growing up in him , " I 'm going to lose , and I 'm going to remarrage , and I 'm going to report a very .
I 'm not good enough and I can 't do it . "
And instead of going to go to the panic , stop .
He got the whole mental process and made something completely new .
He just just just the sky and said , " Scussian , you know , I 'm driving ? "
" You think it 's going to write a song now ? "
If you really want to exist , you get a more opporting time when I can take care of you .
Otherwise , you 're going to importun-qualcement .
You know , to disturbing Leonard Cohen . "
And his work has changed after this .
Not the work , the work , it was still dark .
But the process , and the heavy anics that attack was released when the genius was remained when the genius was handed to the other problems and liberated it back where it was , making it .
but you don 't have this peculiar , wonderful bizarre collaboration in Tom and this strange and external thing that was not Tom .
So , as I felt that story started to change a little bit even the way I worked and save me once .
This idea , I got to save when I was writing " Mangia , Prega , Ama , " and falls in one of those cave disperation where we 're all working on something and we can 't start to think that it will be a disaster , which is the worst book writing .
Not just bad , just the worst book written .
And I started thinking about giving this project .
But then I remind I was talking about Tom that was talking about the air and I tried .
So I raised my face on the wild manufacturing and I was doing my committer , and I was in the room .
And I said , " Look , what , you know , both of you know , if this book is not going to be bright , I 'm sure if this book is not going to be bright ?
Because as I see I 'm putting everything I have , I don 't have this .
So if you want to be better , you have to present you and do your side .
OK . But if you don 't do it , you know what , I don 't do anything .
I 'm going to write the same because it 's my work .
And I want to do for that that was recorded that I 've got to do my part , " Because -- at the end is so , OK -- I mean , " -- centuries ago in the North Africa people were duned for dancing dancing , dance and music that went on and hours to the dances that went on for the double-foreign Africa , and to the date .
And they were magnificent , because the ballers were professionals and they were great .
But every so , rarely , something happened , and one of these artists had become transformer .
And I know you know what I talk about , because I know you all saw it , a performance so .
It was like the time , and the dancer walked through a kind of landed by a kind of land-a-, and it was doing nothing else from the usual , like 1,000 notes before , but everything was aligned .
And suddenly , it doesn 't look at the same as a human .
But it 's accent from the divinity of the divinity of the divinity .
And when this happened , when this was the people knew what was called her .
They had their hands and started singing , " Allah , Allah , Allah , Allah , God , " God , " God , "
That 's God , you know .
Kids 's great note -- when the Mori the Spain , I got this habitude with them and the pronounced up in the centuries from " Allah , Allah , " to " Ole , " , " which you can still hear in the corries or in the flames or the fleamed .
In Spain , when a artist did something impossible and magic , " Allah , " Allah , " Abbout , " incomprehensible , " Take , " A last of God .
And it 's great because we need .
But , the problem comes the next day , for the dancer , when you wake up and discover that are 11 in the morning of Martedesday and the last last of God .
It 's just a mortal with gran bad ginoches , and maybe never get it to make that height .
And maybe nobody 's going to sing the name of God 's still going to go and what does it to do with the rest of his life ?
It 's hard .
This is one of the most path-in-dolorous life .
But maybe it doesn 't have to be so anguess if you can 't believe , and mostly , that the most extraordinary aspects of your being come from yourself .
But you would just believe that you 're going to prested by an inimaginable source of this team is a little bit of your life that you have to go to somebody else when you 're finished .
And , you know , if we think it 's all changes .
And so I started thinking about it , and it 's certainly how I thought I was a lot of several months in the book , which I 'm going to give you a dangerous , attesissues followed my my great successful .
And what I have to keep telling me when I feel electric .
It 's not to just your work . It 's just your work .
It 's a presentation to your side , any can be .
If your job is dancing , balling .
If the divine , absurd genius to give a few kinds of wonderful , just just to leave some kind of wonderful , for one moment through your effort , then " Ole ! "
Otherwise , you do the same dance .
And " Ole ! " You know the same .
I think and I should teach it .
" You know , " at you , even just for human friendly and testing tale of tale , to make you go to present you continue .
Thank you .
Thank you .
June Cohen : Ole !
As you know I 've talked about some of these projects on the human genome , what can mean and discovery new new set of genes .
Now we 're starting a new path : we started to digitize biology and now starting from that digital code are entering in a new biology , designing and design and synthesizing life .
We 've always been trying to take big questions .
What is life ? " It 's something that many biologists have tried to understand various levels .
We 've tried different approaches , reduced it to the minimum .
We 're digitizing by almost 20 years .
When we sequenced the human genome was treated by the analome of the world 's analome of the digital world of the computer .
Now we ask us , can we regenerate life , or create new life from this digital universe ?
This is the map of a little organism , Mycoplasma genitalium , which is the species from the smallest genome of the little organism between those that can authory .
And we tried to reduce the genome for creating one more little .
We can eliminate a hundred genes of genes about 500 .
But when we look at the metabolic map , it 's relatively simple than our own .
I believe me , this is simple .
But when we look at all the genes we can eliminate , one at the time , it 's very unlikely that this can bring a living cells .
So we decided that the only way we decided to synthesize this chromosome in a way that could modify the components to bring some of these fundamental questions .
And so we started the adventure of " Can we can synthize a chromosome ? "
Can the chemistry to make these big molecules that we never had to create these big molecule that we never did before ?
And , in the case of affermative , can we make a chromosome ?
A chromosome is just a piece of inert material .
The speed with which we can digitize life is growing up to exponential life is growing exponential .
Our ability to write the genetic code , instead , progret , but it 's getting improving , but it 's improving .
And our most recent results the return to a exponential curve .
We started over 15 years ago .
The process has been asked a lot of passages , starting with a bioethical required before we started the first experiments .
But we found that synthesize is very difficult .
There are tens of thousands of machines in the world that produces little DNA checks , of 30 to 50 letters , and it 's a degenerative process : the more the segment is longer , there are .
So we had to develop a new method to assemble these fragments and correct the mistakes .
And this was our first attempt , starting from the digital genome , from the digital genome of Phi X 174 .
It 's a little virus that kills bacteria .
We designed the fragments , effectuated the correction of errors and get a DNA molecule of the DNA molecule .
The interesting part is when we got this piece of the inert material , inert material , and we put it in the bacteria , the bacteria have started reading this genetic and viral particles .
The viral particles have been released by cells , they 're back and back and they destroyed the E.
I 've been talking about recent with the oil industry tells that they 're certainly saying they have this model .
They have recognized you .
We believe that this is a situation where the software can actually build its own hardware in a biological system .
But we wanted to do things largest .
We wanted to build the whole chromosome of the bacteria .
It 's over 580 thousand reading of the genetic code .
So we thought we could build it in the cassets of the size , this is that that can change the cassets of a living cells that .
Does crucial , and if we start with digital information in a computer , these must be very accurate .
When we sequencenced this genome for the first time in 1995 accuracy accuracy was a mistake for every 10 thousand low .
We found , resequence it , 30 errors . If we had that original sequence we never would have been able to do it work .
One part of the process is designing 50 leckers that dreams with all the other other other than 50 letters to build little bit smalls for building small subunits to build little little bit more subunits to build subunits .
We try to unique elements here .
You probably read that we 're sitting in the filanded that we put in the filand-up .
Think about this , we have a genetic code on four letters : A , C , GDs and T.
Three of those letters put together with about 20 friminoid amminominoacids , and there 's a specific order of reading for every friminds .
So we can use the genetic code to write words , frases , thoughts .
What we did at the beginning was autographed .
Some of them have been dolusers from the fact that it wasn 't poeia .
We designed these segments for a few checkers just joining them with enzymes .
There are enzymes that repair them and put them up .
And we started assemble parts , starting with segments from five to seven thousand leckets , uncles in a way that forming segments in the way to form 72 thousands and 72 thousand lect-hand-achieved .
Everything we have produced these segments in abundance so that we can sequence them out of creating an extremely robutobestoking -- as you 'll see in a minute .
We 're trying to automatize the process .
So , this looks like the tabellon of a basket player .
When we get these very long , more than 100 thousand low-thousand bottom , they 're not going to grow more directly in E.
You get to the modern instruments of molecular biology .
So we 've been considered other mechanisms .
We knew another mechanism called recombination omologue , which in biology is to repair the DNA segments to join the DNA segments .
Here 's an example .
This organism , called Deinococcus radiodurans , can absorb three million radiation .
You can see in the superior as his crumosome as his crumosome ,
In 12 -- 24 hours , it 's been replaced as it was before .
There are thousands of organisms that are able to do it .
These organisms can sit to completely .
They can live under vacuum .
I 'm absolutely sure that life exist in space , and you hear places to find new environments of water .
At the true , NASA showed this .
This is an image of molecule that we 've built these processes , just using these processes , just using the lights on the segments from insert to insert .
The lights assemble them .
This picture wasn 't taken taken with a microscope , but with a microscope , but with a microscope .
It 's a molecule that we can see it with a microscope .
These are pictures that cover a period of about six seconds .
This is the ads we 've done a little time ago .
They 're over 580,000 lecter-genetic code .
It 's the biggest molecule of a defined structure ever created by man .
It 's got a 300 million molecular fish at 300 million .
If you stampassiase it with a 10 without spaces , it would take 142 pages just to transfer this genetic code .
Now , how do we do it work ? How do we do it ?
Of course , you 're tramed to a virus is a game .
It 's a little bit more complicated when you use bacteria .
It 's simpler cells as well as it 's eucariariote like our : you can just extract the nucleus and put another one , which is basically the process of cloning process .
In the archaea bacteria , the cell is instead in the cells , but we have recently demonstrated that we 're able to do a whole whole bunch of a cell cell from another and to activate it .
We clear a crumosome from a microbial cycle .
two are different as the men from the mouse .
We added some gene gene in a way that I could decide what to this chromosome .
And then , the golved with the enzymes so that killing all the proteins .
And when we put it in the cells was study -- and you 'll open our sophisticatomic graphical graphical graphical graphical graphical graphical graphical graphical graphical graphical graphical graphical graphical graphical graphical graphical graphic graphical graphical graphical graphical graphical
And we started thinking that we couldn 't go beyond , but we 've tried anymore in the way .
This is one of the greatest mechanisms of evolution .
We found that a lot of species have added species to a second or third chromosome , and I add in a thousand tracts in a second thousand tracts in that species .
So the people think about evolution as a gene only once it 's a gene and at the time that has not understand a lot of biology .
They 're actually making the enzyme called restriction enzyme that I 'll make the DNA .
The chromosome that was in the cells , you can 't have one .
The cell phone , the cell phone that we have inserit-down .
He expressed the other as an expressed , and recognized the other as the extreme as an estean material , and we 've got all found with only the cell and the new chromosome .
It became blue because of the genes we put .
And in a short sorts of time , all the characteristics of a species are gone . And you turn into a new species , based on the new software that we put in cells in the cells .
All the protects have changed , the members have changed , and when we read the genetic code exactly at what we 've transferred to .
Now , this may seem to look like alchemy genetic , but altering the software , we can change things in substantial way .
Now , I 've already explained that there 's not about genesis -- but of progress starting from three million and a half of evolution , and I said that maybe we 're going to create a new version of Cambrian explosion where we 're going to create new species on this digital process .
Why do that ?
I think it 's pretty obvious when we think about our needs .
We 're going to move from six and a half billion people in the next 40 years .
Right give you an example : I 'm born in 1946 .
Now there are three people on the planet for each existing in 1946 , there 's four years .
We 're having problems now to find food , freshold and clean , medicine and bulus , medicine and a half billion people .
It 's going to be more harder to do it for nine billion .
We use more than five billion carbon , more than 30 billion carbon , more than 30 billion bulles of oil .
That means a million bullets a day .
When we try to find organic processes , or whatever kind of process to replace them , it 'll be a huge challenge .
And we have to keep the whole CO2 emission of all the emission of CO2 , in the atmosphere .
At day , thanks to the scientific discoveries all over the world , we have a database with about 20 million genes , and I love to think they 're the designed components for the future .
The electronics only has a dozen about the dozen of components , and think about how many different things are coming out .
Our limitations are just just the mainly of the biological and our imagination .
Now we have some techniques , because of these quick methods , in the degree synthesization , in fact , we call it combinatory genomics .
We can build a million crubber robot that can produce a million chromosomes a day .
Think about these 20 million genes are different genes or to optimize the processes to produce eight or drugs , new vaccines , we can change , thank you very new vaccines , and create more biology now that in the last 20 years of science .
And it 's just a standard selection .
We can choose to survival , chemical production or fuel , or fuel production , or fuel production .
This is an instantaneous instantaneous instantly , we 're working on to be able to seats us and design species to computers .
Well , we don 't know how they 're going to be .
We know exactly how their genetic code .
Now we 're focused on the fourth generation of the fourth generation .
You also saw you that extract ethanol from grate was a finial experiment .
We have cool cool and third generation that are going to use enough sugar with sugar , in the higher , as the eight-carbon or different kinds of butanol .
But the only way biology can have a great impact without increasing increasing more the cost of food and limitary the cost of food and limitary the cost of food and limitary the cost of the first , so we 're working to design cells that can achieve this purpose , and we think we can have the first carbs of fourth generation in about 18 months .
The solar light with CO2 is a metodo-- but in our discoveries all over the world , we have found different metods .
This is a organism that we described in 1996 .
He lives in the deep ocean , at about 2,500 feet deep at the temperature of water .
They create a methane from CO2 molecular as a molecular energy .
We 're trying to figure out if we can incanalate CO2 , that can easily be transported through tubes , converting that CO2 in the carburant , to drive this process .
So , short , we think we could be able to increase what the basic question of " What is life " is " We , " greatest " is " We , " We have the modress of replace the oil industry .
Exactly . If you can 't do it from TED , where do you can ?
It would become a main the source of energy .
And also , we 're working for using the same metods to create instantaneous instantaneous vaccines .
You 've seen this year with the flu , we 're always back to a year and with a dollar , when it comes to find the fell .
I think what you can change with combinable vaccines in advaccines .
That 's how the future could start to seem changing , the evolution of evolution , accelerating evolution with the synthetic bacteria , areas , and finally cells cells .
We 're so from improving people .
Our purpose is to make it long enough to try to do it . Thank you very much .
First of all , I 'm going to show you , the fastest possible , some fundamental , the new technology that we 've taken to Microsoft , almost a year ago . This is Seadron .
It 's a environment in which you can interact is the local level that remote with a huge amount of visual data .
Here we 're seeing a lot of gigabyte digital photograph with a kind of sudden , and continuous , for a panoramic fast , and by a panoramic fast , and having the images like we want .
And it doesn 't matter how much much much much much of information we see , how big these things are these things that are great , these things are these things that are great , these things that we see , how big these things are the amount of information that we see , how big the amount of information that we see , how big the amount of information that we see , how big the amount of information that we see , how big these things are these things that are big ,
Most of them are digital photographs , but this is a scanning scanning from the Library of Congress , and it recome back in the gamel of 300 megapile .
It doesn 't make any difference because the only thing that 's the only thing that the prestation of a system like this is the number of pixels on your screen in any time . It 's also a very flexible architecture .
This is a whole book , example of data not images .
This is the Casa desolate Dickens . Every colonna represents a chapter .
To demonstrate that it 's just like , and not images , we can do something like that , to actually actually make a real representation of the text , not a picture .
It could be a way a little artificial to read an electronic book .
I don 't know it .
This is a more realistic example . It 's a number of the Guardian .
Every picture is the beginning of a section .
And it really gives you the plepleasure , and the becomes to the real cartaceea 's version or a newspaper , which is for nature of a moltex .
We also did something with the corner of this particular number of the Lardian .
We created a higher ads higher resolutioneer than you use in a normal ads , and we put it in an advertising .
If you want to see the characteristics of this automobile , you can see here .
Or other models , or even the specific techniques .
And this really shows some of these ideas to eliminate the limits of space on the screen .
We hope that that means you put up to the end up the pop-up and other porcheries , no longer to be necessarily .
Of course , the map is one of the most obvious applications for this kind of technology .
And I don 't want to lose time , if we don 't know that we have contribute to this field .
These are all the streets in the U.S. and the U.S. geospacatial picture of NASA .
So , we 're going to do something else .
This is actually the alive on the Web ; you can go to see .
It 's a project called Photosynthy , which combine two different technologies .
One is a Seadragon and the other is a very interesting computer visual in Noah , a student of Noah Snavely , a student of Steve Seitz 's aid , with Steve Seitz 's Seitz 's UW Szi , Rick Szones . " At the collaboration . "
And it 's from the Web , managon the Weadragon .
You can see it when we do this kind of screen , where we can go from a picture to another and have this kind of experience to the other and have this kind of experience .
But the space-spaces of the images here has actually a meaning .
The algorithms of computers have been recorded these pictures together , so that they 're all lined to reals in the real places that I imagine -- all the close of the Br. British Rockiceous canadesishes -- they 're screen . Here you see the elements of a de-de-mandated or panoric imaging panoric , and these things are all the space-de-in-de-manued landed level lines ,
I don 't know if I have time to show you some other environment .
There are a lot more space-lot more spaces .
I want to move directly to one of the original Noah-- and this is from a previous prototype of Photosynthy that we have done for the first time last summer . S-- to show you what I think is really the key key to be the key key to the right thing that I think is really the key key to the environments we have put in the Web .
We had to worry about legal aspects and so on .
This is a reconstruction of Notre Dame pictures press by Flickr . Basta digitary Notre Dame , Flickr and you get pictures of the kind of shirts , other than these orange hang hang 's out of this picture that 's discovered to this model .
So , they 're all pictures of Flickr and they 're all linked at the spatial level in this way .
And it 's possible to navigate this very simplest way .
You know , I 'd never thought I 'd end to work for Microsoft .
It 's very gratificent to get this kind of acachievement here .
I think you can see that it 's a lot of different kinds of fotoss -- from those of the cell phones to those of the SLR , a meaning , put together in this environment .
And if I can , I try and try and look at those strange .
Many are blocked by faces , etc .
Somewhere there is a series of photographs -- here 's a series of photographs -- here .
This is a Notre Dame recorded correctly .
We can go from the poster to the physics of this environment .
The essential is that we can do things with social environment . This is now taking data from the sudden , the whole memory of how it looks like the land , from the visual point of view -- and links all those data together .
All those pictures become linked together , greater than the sum of the parts .
You have a model of land that emerges emerges .
Think about this as a Stephen Lawler 's work on Earth .
It 's something that grows in complexity as people use it , and the people who use it . And the advantages to increase with the use .
Their pictures are hushed with inseries on other people .
If you get somebody is the idea of contracting all these sannotion , my photographs of Notre Dame suddenly arriches of all those data , and I can use it as a remarks of those data , and I can use how to immergerm to that space , in that metaph-like photos , and have a cross-user experience , and cross-user experience .
Of course , a consequence of all that are virtual models , extremely elaborate of every part of the land , and it doesn 't just give you a very much of the achievement of the collective memory .
Thank you .
CA : I got understood ? What your software ? What your software is going to take us to do is that , at a certain point , in the next years , all of photographs are going to be made a certain point in the world are going to be made a lot of connected together ?
BAA : Yeah . What 's doing is actually discover .
It 's creating hyperlink , if you want to pictures .
And it 's doing it in the content of images .
The thing becomes very interesting if you think about wealth of semantement information that many of these pictures have .
As you do a picture of images on the Web , you have a phrase and the text on the web page is a lot of information about pictures .
Now , what happens if that picture is you 're relates to all your pictures ?
So the amount of semantical interconnection and the amount of wealth that is really huge . It 's a classic effect of the network .
CA : Blaise , it 's really amazing . Compliments .
BAA : I thank you very much .
One of the main pleasures when you travels up and one of the thetnographics is the way to live in the people who don 't forgotten the anti-traditions , you know , the past the wind , the tooth-wind , you get out of the glower plant .
Bastes think that the sciamans Jaguar vision still , the Lattea , or that the people 's 's Mitites are still in meaning , or that in Himalaya , the buddists still sets the breath of the Dharma , to remind the central importance of anthropology , and that the idea that the central importance of the ange of anthropology , and that the idea that the world we live in absolute ,
the consequence of a particular adaptative choices that our stes did , well or evil , many generations ago .
And , of course , we all share the essential tracts .
Everybody is hidden . We all procreation .
We 're subjects to start .
We have to deal with the inexorability of death , so we don 't surprising a death .
We all have an art .
What it hits is the particular rhythm of the song , the rhythm of every culture .
It doesn 't matter that are the Penan Ir. or the following Vodoo or , the Ws of the Vodoo 's the Kenya , or the Curander 's Curander in the Spectenth , or a cameras in the heart of the Sahara .
He was my journey company in desert a month ago , or a month ago , or a yak from the Web of the world 's values .
All these people are teaching us that there are other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , other ways of moving in the world .
And if you think a moment , if you think it 's a concept that it can give you hope .
And with , the myriades of the world create a ragnonoela of spiritual and cultural life that is happening the planet and it 's important for well-being of the planet as the wear biology note as biosphere .
And you can think of this cultural ragnoishes like an etnosphere and you can define the whole sum of all the conception of all the concepts , dreams , ideas , intuitions , ideas , intuitions , ideas , bringing to be from being from being from being the human imagination from the alba of consciousness .
The thnosphere is the fantastic patrimonium of humanity .
It 's the symbol of what we 're and what we can be as inququest species .
And because the biosphere was very much consumed as the biosphere has been consumed to the etnosphere and unfortunately .
None biologist , for example , that would say that 50 percent of all species has been or is on the orders of the extinction just because it 's fake , or the most apocaly-to-great-based , and not getting close close to the most optimistical hypothesis -- that the cultural diversity .
The index of this is , of course , the language loss .
When you 're born 6,000 languages on this planet .
One language is not just a vocabulary , or a series of a series of rules .
One language is the sprace of human spirit .
It 's the half the animal of every culture is coming in in the material world .
Every language is a forest , a wine , a thought , a kin , an ecosystem possibility .
And of those 6,000 languages , as we 're in Monterey , at least half the hasn 't come up in Monterey , and the children .
They 're not taught to children , which means , unless we shouldn 't sheets something , which is already death .
What 's more sad than the sad of being , you know , the last language , to be the last language , the way to talk a language , the wisdom of you know , you know , you know ,
This is horrigging was in some of the world every two weeks , every two weeks a old one weeks , a old mostly muor and door with it in the tombol .
And I know somebody of you will tell , " Is it not much better .
The world wouldn 't be a better place if you talk all the same language ? " Benissim , then we talk all about yoruba . We talk about the dot-handed yoruba .
We talk about kogi .
You know , it 's a tractable thing that can 't talk about your own language .
I 'd like to do a journey through the thnosphere --
a little journey in the etnosphere to give you a hip of what we 're losing .
Many of us forgot that when I say , " different ways of existing , " I mean , " I mean , " different ways of exists , " I mean , " different ways of us . "
We take for example , Barasana Barasana , in the settlement , the people of the anacond , which creates the myth to come from the river of the east in the west sacred sacred in the west sacred sacred sacred sacred .
It 's a popular people who can 't distinguish the color blue from the green because the time is identified in the forest , which depends on the population , which depends the popular .
They have a strange language and a matrimonial , detailed language , " " " " You have to marry a person who 's talking to a different language .
All of this has radical in the past mythologic , the particularity is that in these exhibition , is that in these existing families , and none of the mystons of nobody practical advance .
They 're just listening to listen and then start talking .
We take one of the most interesting tribes I have been visited , Waorans of Ecuador north , an amazing popular , an amazing popular that has had the first contacts in 1958 .
In 1957 , five missionaries have been trying to make a fatal mistake .
They did down the photographs that they 'd come down to the photographs that they 'd come back to the gain , forest that this population forest never seen anything bi-size .
They 've been collected to the photos , they spend it to the shape or a shape or and , they 're not finding nothing , they 'd like to do it , and killed the five missionaries with the lance .
But Waorans don 't kill the souls .
They killed them between them .
54 percent of the mortality was caused by themselves .
We 're sended up eight generations and we found two natural death and when we got a natural death , and when we got a lot of them was aged so he 's been invecently , and then killed it killed it . You know , you know , they had an amazing knowledge of the forest .
The hunters were able to recognize the urine animal , from 40 steps and recognize the species .
In the early ' 80s , I 've been assigned a very interesting task when my Harvard professor asked , if I wanted to go to Haiti to sweat the base of the power of Duvalier and Tonton Machchchcheap . And the Tonton Macold , and I got to make my whisisissue to do the gombies .
To give a sense of miraculous way , I should have to understand Vod-od-Can culture , and the Vodoo is not magic .
It 's pretty much about a complex view of the world .
Much interesting .
If I asked you to tell me the great religions of the world , what would you say ?
Cristianity , Islam , Buddismo , Ebraism , Ebraism , etc .
A continent is always left out , thinking that sub-Saharan Africa doesn 't have any religious feels . And they 're doing it , and Vodoo is not the other than the distilside of these religious concepts in the tragic concepts of slavery .
What makes the interesting voodoo is the intense relationship between life and death .
So , the alien have to hidden the spirits .
The spirits can be invoced by the Great Acqua , they respond to the dance of dance and they 're replacing temporarily at the time that the vial , for a short moment , the following acks .
So , for this voodooists , you go to the God .
We give God to the temple and we become God . "
And from the moment you 're possessed , is the spirit that you , how bad do you ?
So you see these incredible events , follow voodoo in the state of trance that touch hits are infuzzons that are infuzzes of the power of the mind when it 's catalized in the state of the body when it 's catalized in the state of the mind when it 's catalized in the state of exciting extreme .
And so , in the people I 've lived the most extraordinary of the Sierra Nevada , in the Sierra Nevada , in the Santa Marta , in the Santa Marta , in the Sectentrional ,
Inscending civilization of the ancient civilization that once had been living on the caraibia 's accounter-cycle , the people were rating on the vulcanic massive plants that the caraibs of the caraibical planning .
In a continent macchievement , this people never have been conquisted by the Spanish .
But now , they 're governed by a clero , but their formation is really extraordinary .
The young people have been taken out of the family , three or four years , and they live in a world of buy and shadow in a world that 's made of dark and shadow in the bottom of the glaciers for 18 years .
Two doubles of nine years choghts to reproduce the nine months of management that spend in in the user-and-a-half years in the user-Mother .
For this time , they 're acculturate to the values of their society , values that predict their prayers and only their prayers to keep the cosmic balance -- or to say the balance balance .
At the end of this amazing initiation , they 're suddenly landed out and for the first time in their life , at 18 years , they see an alba . And in that moment , when the sun was the bloose valle valles , when the sun was the byscape , all of this . And the predict a step back and said , " It 's a step back and say , " It 's a step back and said , "
" Where ? "
It 's amazing . Now , it 's going to protect it . "
They call the greater brothers and they say that we , the minor brothers , we 're the destruction of the world .
This is extremely important .
When we think about the Ingene populations and the environment invoice , we call Rousseau and the old story of wilvacuum , which is a razous concept in its simplicity , maybe I call " Thoreau and we say that these people are closer to the Earth .
Inental people are not feeling or feeling or nostalone .
There is no space for these things in the malarithal paluat or in the winds of the Tibet , but thank you for time and back , they created a mystical mystical idea of the Earth 's not about the concept of the most of the idea that the Earth can live in the Earth can only live because it 's infused by the human consciousness .
What does it mean ?
It wants a little little girl of Ande who grow up in the mountain is a destroke of Apu who 's going to leave her deef , is going to be a deeply different human being being able . And it 's going to have a very different report with the mountain of Montana who grow up in a mountain of rock .
That 's a demnow of one spirit or a mineral was irrelevant .
What 's interesting is the metaphor that debes the relationship between the individual and the natural world .
I grew up in the British 's Columbia credden that forests to be cuted .
And that made me a human being different from my friends Kwautl who believe that the forests are the Hamkuk 's dimora of the paradise and the bage of the paradise and the channibal that are living in the extreme of the world , the spirits that they 're in the Hamatsa .
If you start to consider that these cultures can create different reality , you can start to understand some their own feeling feeling . We take this plants .
I 've taken this aprile in the nordoctor Amazon Amazonia .
Mayathy some of you have heard about the ayath-powerful , psycotive , the most powerful psycotive .
What makes it fascinating the ayahuash is not the farmacological potential of the sustaining , but his elaboration . It 's made by two things .
On one side , this leather , this lian lian lian leav-carboline , harmor and harmoline , harmful .
Take the only plants , you have a blure that you a little bit about consciousness , but it 's measurements with a family 's family 's called Psychoth-hand-year-old hand-old hotrian arblueas .
This plant is a powerful powerful triptamines , very similar to the serotonin , dimethoxtonin , methoxyptttine .
If you ever see Yanomami you 'll pull the Yanomami to the nose sustaff that make a different set of species , kind of , you get methoxt-ptamine .
Tiring that poor is a little bit like being disparated by a paper of paper dipinkes and landing on a sea of electricity . You can 't create a distorsion of electricity . You know , it creates the reality of the reality .
I was a lot of my professor , Richard Evan Shultes , the man who got down the psychedelic , with his discovery , with his discovery in the ' 30s in Messico .
Second my arguesis , you can 't classifer these triptamines like hallucinogens because if you 're not told anybody to be hallucinated . You can 't tell anybody to be sunced , because I 'm denial from a enzyme , " I 'm denially in the intestine , we can 't actually use it .
It 's possible to be at the orally only if you get asking with other chemicals that deny the MAO .
Now , the beautiful carbs , the beauts that are in this lian lian inhibitors of MAO , the same kind of necessary to potential the triptamines . The question is , in a flour , like these people have to find two morogenic species , like these people have to find two morogenic dees not sit , but that if you combints in this way , create a biochemical version that 's suareas to the sum sum of the sum of the sum of the sum of the parts of the sususuperior of the sum of the suarity of the suaper of the sum of the suaper of the sum of the sum of the susual amounts
We use the great eupherror of the proof and error mistake , which can reveal infruit .
But if you ask the Indian , they 'll tell us , " The plants are talking about . "
What does it mean ?
This tribes , the Cofan , has 17 varieties of ayahuash , which is narely in the forest , and that our eyes would come in in the forest , and that our eyes would come in in the forest .
If you ask them how they 're going to stand they 'll tell us , " I thought , " I thought , " I thought , " I thought , " I said , " No . "
The solution is : You take the 17 varieties in a night of moon , and each one will sing with a tone .
With this doesn 't have a Harvard , but it 's much more interesting than content the stones .
Now , [ applausi is that even the problem is that the people of us who have to heart people find them are paintings are paintings , but somehow reduced in the margins of the story that we have to have a real world , and pass .
In fact , the 20th century , in 300 years , it 's not going to remind for its gueres or innovations , but rather as the one was where we stopped and acactively actively or accepted accepted , or accepted accepted , or accepted , the problem is not the change .
All cultures through the centuries have been involved in a dance for new life possibility of life .
And the problem is not technology .
The Indian Sioux , they don 't have stopped in the Sioux , when they put in the American and recice as Americans don 't have to be Americans when they put in the horse and calute .
It 's not the change or technology that threatened the integrity of the thnosphere . It 's the power .
The flight of the domination .
And if you look at the world , you 'll find that these are not destinated cultures that are not destinated cultures that are not destinated cultures that are not destinated cultures that are not destinated cultures that are not destinated cultures that are not destinated in the world , you 'll find that these are not destinated cultures that are not destinated cultures that are not destinated in the world ,
They 're living creatures and dynamic creatures out of the existence of hyperforces that go beyonic forces .
I know that you 're disboscation in the patria of Penan --
a people of Sarawake , in the west Southeest , a popular that lived in free to a generation , and now reduced to a generation ago , and now reduced to the servitoes , where you can see the river 's river , where you can see the river fabababove the report that seems to take away the back to the horizon Meridional Meridional Meridional Meridional Meridional , where the horizoning the horizonte ,
Women to fill the stone stone of the subtle to the forest .
Or , in the case of Yanomami , are the disease that have come with the discovery of the gold .
If we move on on the mountains of Tibet , where I 'm doing a lot of research , you 'll see the hard hard flight of politics .
Like the genocide , the physics of a popular popular , is convicted to the universal level , but the nice , the destruction of life of a popular life , not only is convicted , but addicted in certain environments , because it makes part of the strategy , because it makes part of development .
And you can 't understand the Tibet 's suffering of Tibet until you 're in the beginning .
I 've been path the 6,000 miles from Chengdu in Western China through the West , you get to Lhasa with a young colleagues , but only come to Lhasa young colleague , but only came to Lhasa , I got the statistics of which we feel talking .
6,000 sacred sacred in dust and cenjoy .
1.2 million people killed by the military during the Cultural Rivolution .
The dad of this guy was ascriticized at Panchen Lama .
That means that it 's been killed in the temples of the Chinese invasion .
His , the uncle was sitting with Sua durity in Santity , he 's got brought in Nepal .
Sua mother was imprigioned and his colpe was to be rich .
It was brought to the age of two died in the age of two years from under his gonna because he couldn 't live without him .
The sister , who did the same , it was put in reeducational field .
A day he inavailably calculated a day of Mao and , for this transgression , was put on the seven-year-old jobs for seven years .
The Tibet of Tibet is unoverwhelmed , but the reesterday of the people 's people 's 's tener .
At the end , everything is a choice .
Do we want to live in the monothopic world of the monothost of the world 's policy ?
The great anthropologiet Mead , before he died said that his biggest fear was that , in our way to do this advance , not only we 'll see the whole range of human imagination reduced to a very constitute about a sleeping constitute for thinking , but one day we 're going to wake up from a sleeping slead to the slead to the world .
And it 's umillion remembering that our species is exist for 60,000 years .
The Neolitic Rivolution , who gave us the agriculture , which has done us subject , which has done us subject the share with the skiaming with the skiaming , creating the hip of the skies of specialization , and talk about 10,000 years ago .
The industrialized world has 300 years old .
That 's a story is not suggest that we have the answers to all the challenges that we 're going to have to face in the millennia to come .
When you get these myriades of the world is asked what it means to be human , they 're going to say , they 're going to be human , they 're going to say what humans is human , they 're asked to say what humans mean to be human , they 're asked what it means to be human , they respond to be human , they 're asked what it to say to be human , they 're asked what it to say to be human , they 're asked what it 's human ,
And it 's in these answers that we 're all going to be what we 're : a kind of conscious , that has to make all the people and all the garden can fire . And there 's great moments of optimism .
I 've taken this picture on the northern end of Baffin the island of Baffin the island of Baffin the whales with Inuit , and this man , Olaya , and this man , Olayas , he told me the wonderful story of her grandfather .
The Danadian government has been well-time with the Inuit 's people in the ' 50s to store our supremies our supremies our supremies our colon-to-hon-up .
The grandfather of this man refuted to go .
The family , I teming her life , took him all the time , and all of his attitude .
You have to know that Inuit doesn 't temon the cold , they exploit .
The packs in the origin were made of fishing skin .
The grandfather of this man didn 't have to stand at night , or from the library of the library .
It 's sgattaiolated , it 's calculated the pantalone in the photos and defecated in your hand . When I did it did it , they got a lama .
He sprained on the pink of this hell of this hell of hell and when it became solid , he killed a dog .
It 's taken a glass and created a brighter , with the actic cassa has created a sleep , he got up another chane and he 's disappeared on the banker , hell of the coat , hell in the remains .
We want to talk about cavarself-in-flag . And this , in different ways , [ Applausi is the symbol of resilience of the people in the world .
In the april of the California government has reached the total control of an area of an area of the most of the California and Texas I put together .
It 's their new pathetic . It 's called Nunut .
It 's an independent territory . They 're all the mineraries of the mineraries .
One of the splendidate of how a natione-state can recognize with his people .
And , I think , I 'm obvious , I think it 's pretty obvious than the people of us has been in these remote argue that they 're not remote .
For someone is home .
They represent sections of human imagination that rest to the dawn of temple . And for us all , the dreams of these children , are part of our children , become part of the geography of hope .
First , we 're in National Geographic is really convinced that politicians will never come to nothing .
We believe that the polemids --
[ Applausi is not persuasive , but we believe that the stories can change the world , and maybe we 're the best institution to tell the stories of the world . Every month is our website is to tell 35 million visits .
156 countries transmit our television channel .
Our reviews are lett from millions of people .
Our work is to travel in the etnosphere to bring our audience of wonderful cultural places that will go out of how to blew out how they 're going to have seen , and , abbracching once the central reveal of anthropology : the world of existing anthropology , and we have to find a lifestyle in a world of pluralist and multicultural multicultural life in a world of pluralist and multicultural and multicultural reveal .
where the wisdom of all the people can contribute to our collective well-being .
Thank you .
I 'm going to talk about some things that I 'm writing in this book that I hope you 've already heard and I 'm going to try to figure out some links , in the case , you wouldn 't see them .
I want to start with what I call the " Dogma officer . "
The officer of what ?
The officer of all the West 's factory society , the West 's official dogma is , " If we want to massive well-being of our citizens . " " " " " The way to do it is massive freedom . "
The reason is , from one side , in the fact that freedom is in itself a value , is a useful , is , useful , essential for humans .
Over the other is that if we 're free , each of us can act for just doing it for doing everything that massive to do everything that massive our well-being , without no one that decides in the name of our well-being , without any that decides .
The way to massive massive freedom is massive choice .
More choice people have , the more are free , and greater is their freedom , the wealth , the wealth , the wealth .
This is , I think , it 's so deeply radicated in the society that nobody would dream to put it in doubt .
And it 's also roadicated in our lives .
I 'm going to show you some examples of what progress has made possible .
This is my supermarket . It 's not particularly big .
I lose a simple note on condition .
In my supermarket , there are 175 conditions , without content the 10 varieties of the olive oil and 12 acures that you can buy for a huge number of conditions that you can buy to you a huge number of conditions in the cystation that nobody of the 175 pron-print oil is your degrees .
That 's how the supermarket .
Then you go to the electronic store to buy a store : casse , CD , radio , radio , piaright , the prinlificator .
And in this single store of electronic , there 's a big number of growth .
We can make six million and a half million different combinations using the components that there are only one store .
You have to admit that there 's lots of choice .
Other fields : the world of communications .
Once , when I was a child , you could get all the desire telephone , at the break , which was a mom of Mom Bell .
He had the phone , you didn 't buy it .
One consequence of that , by the way , it was the phone never reached .
These days are gone .
We have a varieties almost illimited variety of telephones , especially the cell phones .
Here 's the cell phones of the future .
My favorite is that in the middle , reader MP3 , stops , and the binch of the baby me .
If you don 't have yet seen it in the store under home , you 're hen certain that soon is going to get .
And what happens is that people come in in the gods and ask this question . And you know what the answer is , " No . "
It 's not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn 't do too much .
So , in other aspects of life that are much more important than the purchases , it 's really the same choice .
Assistence health care : no longer in the United States that you go from the doctor and say what you have to do .
Instead , you go to the doctor , and the doctor says , " OK , we could do A , By Be , " A has these benefits and the risks . What do you want to do ? "
You say , " Dotic , what should I do I ? "
And the doctor says , " A has these benefits and these risks , B , and you have these gases and these risks . "
" What do you want to do ? "
And you rebat , " Would if she were me , what would you do ? "
And the doctor , " But I 'm not . "
The result we call it " mality " , " expression that makes it look like a nice thing .
But it 's actually not that one smooth and responsibility to make decisions from somebody who knows something , which is the doctor , to someone else you know , and almost certainly is maled -- and so it doesn 't know anything that 's not about ideal condition to make the patient .
There 's a huge marketing of products , drug it to people like me and you , that if you think , it 's not a sense , because we can 't buy them .
But if we can 't buy them , why do you get them ?
The answer is that they want to domorning , we call the doctor to ask them to change the recipe .
Something that is the identity is our identity is a question of choice , as you see in this wooden , " We don 't want to force children . " We don 't want to give the children . " We don 't know more an identity : we have to invent it .
And we can reinvent how many times we do it .
That means that every morning , at the risk , you have to decide that kind of person want to be .
It turns out to the family and marriage , a time perspective , a time perspective , which was that there there was the most earest possible , and it was that it was that you married the most pron possible .
The only real choice was with people , not when , and even what to do after .
Over , it 's really to play .
I teach very intelligent students , and I do 20 percent in less than a time .
And it 's not because they 're not just bright , because they 're not not because they 're not not because they 're not just a bright .
but why am I impensieriteriteration , I 'm going to married or not ? Would I marry or not ? Would I do that now ? "
" Would I married to marry ? "
They 're interrogatives logoranants .
And they 're looking for the answer to these questions , even though this is not complete the companies that I 'm checking and not getting a vote of my examples .
And they really have to do it . They 're important .
Now , the work : we 're lucky , like Carl underolder , because technology allows us to work every minute , every day , from every day , from every day , from every day , from every day , from every day , from the Hotel Randolph .
And I 'm talking about , there 's a corner , and I 'm not going to tell nobody what the WiFi works .
I don 't know , because I want to use it .
What does this mean , this amazing freedom of choice that we have to work ? It 's that we have to decide , continuously , if we have to work or not .
We can go to see our son playing hot , with the cell phone , the cell phone in the other , and the Blackberry in the other , and the notebook , and the notebook , and the notebook , and the notebook , behind .
And even though they 're all spent , every minute that we see our kids finished , we 're also asking this called ?
" Did I have to answer this email ? I got to abbozzy this literal ? "
And even when the answer is " no , " no , " all this makes the experience of your son 's 's party .
So , anywhere we look at , little , and large materials , and large materials and life , life is a question of choice .
Once the world was this : Of , there were some chance , but not all was a question of choice .
The world is now good at this : The dilemma is , " Is it a good thing , or negative ? "
The answer is Sorry .
The positive latest ones we know , so I 'm going to talk about negative people .
All this choice compories are two negative effects on people .
The first , paradoxically , is that produces instead of liberation .
With a lot of options between the choices , becomes very hard to do it .
I give you an example : a conduct example : a condot in the volunteers .
A table of my colleagues had access to Vange , giant source society , with about a million million employees in 2,000 different companies .
What she found is that for every 10 solutions that are offered in more , the percentage of adesion , one 's percentage falls down two percent .
With 50 offerals , there 's 10 percent in less adhhesions than the adhesions are only five . Why ?
Because with 50 fourds in 50 four-four-foundly difficult to decide , and choice is remain to the initial .
And tomorrow , and I still asked tomorrow , tomorrow , and tomorrow , and of course , tomorrow ,
You know , it doesn 't just mean that these work from old people will eat food for the dogs because they 're not going to have enough money , it also given that decision is so host that the decision is so host that allowed the dator of work .
They 're not participating , they 're losing until five thousand dollars for year from the work , which would be well-displace .
So , the paralysis is a consequence of having too many choices .
And I think it makes the world that is .
" And finally , " Would you end up , ketchup , senape or maion ? "
You would just take the right decision , if it 's for ethernity , is it ?
You don 't want to choose the wrong bottom , and you 're not going to pick the wrong condition .
So this is the first effect . The second is that even though we can avoid the paralaliis and make a choice , we 're fewer by the result of how we were being done with less options , as we were done with less options .
And this is a lot of reasons .
One of these is that with a lot of condition , you know , if you buy one and not perfect , it 's not easy to imagine that you could have been doing a different choice of the result of the choice , and the replace is that the alternative to imagine you like choice , and the reflect of choice , and the replace as the decision is the replace that you would have to be a little bit of the decision ,
even when it was a very good decision .
Over the more choice , it 's easier than any details that it 's insophister than the choice is insophisting of choice .
And also , there 's what economists call expensive ex-opportunity .
Dan Gilbert has clear very well stamattine like the value that we give things to the things depends on what we 're confronted with .
And then , when there are lots of options , it 's easy to represent features of alternative showing the attractive feat the option that you 're choice .
Here 's an example . I 've been schooling with all the ones that are not New York .
But that 's what you probably think you 're going to think .
There 's this couple to Hamptons .
A place of lussian place of leaf .
It 's splendida . Otma day . It 's all about them .
It 's not nothing . But what he thinks is , " Well , maledition , is Agor . "
" All my neighbors in Manhattan are away . "
" I could talk about giving just the home of the home . "
And it 's going to spend two weeks of losing -- every day -- the chance of parking -- the chance of parking where it wants .
The constantly decrease the satisfaction for what we have , even when the choice was an excellent .
And the options that we have to consider , the more the actractive features to us are going to return with how exist opportunity .
Here 's another example .
This is telling us a lot of things .
It 's about life , and maybe in the life , and maybe to live slowly .
But the most important thing is that you get to , you get down to do not do other .
The things we don 't choose to take a lot of attractive , which can make less attractive what we do .
Third point : the spiral growing of expectations .
I tried it on my skin buying a new jeans .
I 'm almost always jeans .
Once the jeans were just like , buy them and bought , and they were brought , they were discomodissimes , only after having a life and work a lot of times , starting to go .
So , I went to buy a couple of new when the old people were gone , and said , " I need a couple jeans , this is my cutter . "
The commit said , " Lake wants slim , leather , lead , relaxed ? "
He wants to the cerniera or with the bottons ? " Stonewashed , " or " acidasases ? "
" Would you want to strate ? "
" Wotter wants or stretch ? " Bla bla -- " Continuated it . "
I was sbalord , and after a little bit , I could say , " I want the guy to say , " I want the only guy , " I want to know , " I want to know all jeans . " I want to say , " " I want to know , " jeans , " I want to say , " " " jeans that I ever had .
It was the massive . With all that choice I had the best .
But I felt worse .
Why ? I 've written a whole book to understand it .
The reason I was worse is that with all that choice is that with all that choice , the jeans had to be perfect .
I was at the beginning . I didn 't expect anything except when I was there there was only one guy , but when I saw 100 different , steps , accidents , at least a kind of had to be perfect .
What I had taken was good , but not perfect .
After I had a choice with what I was trying to do is unabsolutely uncomfortable in front of the waiting .
The added options in the life of people don 't do that increase the expectations that have respect to the excellence of options .
And this is going to produce less satisfaction , even when the results are good .
None in the world of marketing , you know ,
Because if they knew it , you wouldn 't know what I 'm talking about .
The truth looks more at this .
" You know , it was better when it was worse was worse when it was worse was even even when it was worse was still possible to meet of surprised as much as the pleasure .
And it 's all about the world we live in -- opulent , industrialized citizens with the expectancy of performance -- the massive we can hope is that things are on the altitution of expectation .
You never have surprised pleasant because your waiting , my waiting , my waiting , you 're ingiant .
The secret of happiness -- what you 're here -- is , " Baxis , " You know , " Yes , " You know , " You want it . "
I mean , little whologists -- that are really married and my wife is really amazing .
I couldn 't do it , I couldn 't do it . I 'm not accounted .
But it 's not always a bad thing is not always a bad thing .
And finally , a consequence of buying a couple of jeans when there is only that jeans is that when you 're not satisfactory , and ask you , " Why ? "
" Who is responsible ? " " The answer is clear .
The world is responsible . What could I do you do ?
When there are hundreds of kinds of jeans , and buy a insophister , and you ask you who is the responsible , it 's the accountaable , is the clear , it 's the closer , you .
You could have done better .
With hundreds of varieties , there are no skeeps for insuccess .
So when people take decisions decisions , even though the result is valive , they 're feeling and they give the hit to them , they 're satives they 're going to do it .
In the last years , the depression is exploded in the industry .
I think that a meaningful factor -- not the only one , but important -- this wave of depression is that people have dollar experiences because standards are too high .
And when they have to explain this situation think that the colence is they think they 're .
So the final result is that we 're better , objectively , but we heard about it .
Let me remember you .
This is the officer dogma , what we all take for good and it 's completely fly . It 's not true .
There 's no doubt that a little bit of choice is better than I have to do , but by this doesn 't take a lot of choice is better than a little bit .
There 's a critical value , magic value . I don 't know what it is .
But I 'm sure we 've been enough that we 've overcome from a piece of the level where the choices make our life .
Now , from the political point of view -- I 've almost finished -- from the political point of view , the following of the political nocccore is .
What it allows this choice in the industrial society is wealth .
There are many places in the world , and you know , you know , the problem is not that they have a choice .
The problem is they have too pop .
So the factory I 'm talking about is a malbeing exusive to modern , wealthy society , Western society .
And what it does deprimy and climbing is this : Steve Levitt Levitt talked about yesterday of those expensive and discoveries of money .
I mean that these choices , complicated and available , it 's not just unuseful .
I 'm very deleteries .
They 're doing it worse .
If a little bit of what in our society is actually allowed to be reversed in those where people have too much chance , it would not just be their life to improve but our life .
This is what economists call a parety-improving improving .
A distribution of income re-income distribution to all the poor -- because of this choice in excess .
To conclude , " You can become everything you want " --
You , people of culture , you think , " What does that create that fish ? "
" It 's obvious that you can 't make anything in a glass box . "
" A imagination , a strated view of the world -- "
and I 'm going to get the interpretted so , at the beginning .
But then , I think , I 'm realized that the fish is the long .
Because the fact is that if you 're missing the box , so that " everything is possible , " you can 't get the freedom . "
If you break the box , you know , it 's decreases possible decrease .
You know , you 're going to reduce the well-being .
Everybody needs a sphere .
This is almost too closely , maybe even for the fish , and it 's certainly for us .
But the absence of some symbolic symbolic symbolicity and , I 'm afraid of a sudden .
Thank you very much .
