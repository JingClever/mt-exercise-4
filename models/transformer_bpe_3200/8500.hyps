So , I showed these these slides to show that the calotta glacial glacial glacial glacial . And for almost three million years had the size of 48 continental , and it 's restretch of the 48 percent .
But I 'm going to be a gravity of the problem because it doesn 't show it a spessor of the ice .
The glacial glacial cyyynamal , in a certain sense , the heart of the climate system .
You can expensive and you can sleg up .
The next slide will be a fast carrelated to the last 25 years .
The ice acus are drawn in red .
As you see , you 're going to go to blue .
That 's the ice in the inverno , which you 're ritizen of the summer .
You can see that the cosident said , ice , five years or more , it 's like blood , which is the blood of the body .
In 25 years , it 's been on so much .
This is a problem because the recenter of the ground ground ground ground .
I 'm going to spect the totality of the atmospician to the totality , that could doubt , super----waste , super----refly , super---scale , super--scale , super--year-old , right point .
In some laghi profound in Alaska metan is already rebolling from water .
The professor Katey Walter of the University of Alaska , it 's a team of a bulb , I 'm going to slow it .
Video : Wow ! Al Gore : Lo is good . The question is if we 're going to be .
A reason is that this extraordinary termal re-scale Groenland from the northern northern .
This is a glacial regime .
The landed had never reached to you .
This is the Kangerlussuaq , in the sounds of the Groenland .
If you want to know how to ssea level of the sea to the ice of the sea .
These are deal .
The other side of the planet : Antards , the biggest block of the planet .
The month , the scientists have dichiared that the arm of the ice is in negative , and that Antarttards , which is a Western , which is in a ball of the submarine , it 's particularly fast .
And it 's six feet of the acque , like Groenland .
Sulle Himalaya , the third block of ice , you see new laghi , which was a few years ago , they were glacier .
40 percent of the population of the world 's population will get to the water of the potail .
Sulle Ande : this ice is the source of water ,
The landed is increase .
But when it 's going to be the same accade , the same accade to water a potable .
In California the neighborhood of the 40 percent .
The rules are in crisis .
The predictions , as you have , they 're good .
The growth of seseveral sus in the world door to a remarkable .
The disaster of environmental disaster , and it 's going to be out of the normal and without precedent .
Four times more numbers in the last 30 years , respect , and it 's 75 .
This is a sandscape of all insustainable .
If you look at the context , if you can see the consequences .
We add 70 million tons of CO2 million tons of CO2 every 24 hours -- 25 million tons in the ocean every day .
Look at the Pacific area of the oriental Pacific , from the west , and on the substers of the Indian inner , where there 's a royor the inor of the ocean .
The most of the global warming , together to the deforestation , which is the 20 percent , is the use of combustible suyles .
The oil is a problem , and the carbon is even worst .
The United States are one of the two countries with more emissions , together to China .
And you would proposite to build a lot of other central carbon .
But we 're going to have a direction of a direction .
These are the anullated projects in the last few years and some of alternative alternative .
And in the way , there 's a political load in our country .
The carbon of the oil and the oil have 250 million dollars in the last year to promote the carbon , which is a bylit .
That 's the picture of me to something --
And I see Natal , in Tennessee , where I live , there was a loss of 3.8 billion liwwell-carbon .
Maybe you saw on the news .
This is the second largest fluss in America .
It 's successaround Natal .
The publishing of one of the carbon industry was this .
Video : I 'm going to be cold carbon is a lolegro and happy .
It 's a bundying here in America , and it 's growing our economy .
Frosty the carbon is always more pulit .
It 's a good price , and I work and work work with the styypush .
Al Gore : West Virginia .
The biggest society minerair on the mountain is Massey Compyer . This is its friend .
Video : Don Blankenship : I 'm going to do -- Al Gore , Nancy Peloday , Harry Reid -- not what they 're talking about .
Al Gore : So the Alleance for the Clima has been launched two campne .
This is a part of it , a part .
Video : Acore : Alla COLergy : Alla COLergy : Actor in our business .
So , in our priority is investment a big amount of money in one sfort to make public public public public and confused the verity of carbon .
In fact , the carbon is not sporite .
We think it 's clean -- it 's also a good profum .
So , it 's not precups of climate change .
Let me do it .
Video : Acore : Carbone , you 've heard very much .
So I 'm going to do a way around a structure to look for how carbon carbon on the pulit .
Straordinary ! The machines are a little rumorous , but this is the sound of technology .
The consumption of carbon is between the major of global warming , but the remarkable technology of carbon , but the very clear technology that you see all .
You have a look at : this is the odiergain of carbon ,
At Gore : Inally , the alternative positive to the economic issues and the seureal security .
Video : The America is in crisis , the economy , the national economy , the crisis , the climate crisis .
The fix that connection all : our dependence of the combustible , as the carbon sporite and oil oil oil oil .
Now , I 'm going to have a new , audace , to use it .
Repower , 100 percent of a pyyourself in 10 years .
A plan to reput America to work , and make sure sure , and help us to stop the global warming .
And so , a solution that we basts to solve our problems .
Repower America . Scoon .
Al Gore : This is the last .
Video : How : it 's about return to America .
One of the most fast ways of the fast ways of the dependence of the combuystyles that killed our planet .
So , the future is here . Very , a new energy network .
Man : Nowwell-investment for places of work ,
Anyment : Repower . It 's time to be realists .
Al Gore : A old , the African old , " If you want to go to fast , you go to fast .
If you want to go away , you go together . "
We have to go away , quickly .
Thank you very much .
The last year TED year , I did a introduction on the LHC .
And I promise to travel to travel up how it works .
So I 'm going to do . And for those that the other time , there were no , LHC is the biggest experiment ever , 27 kilometers of the conference .
His compask is to reach the conditions that were less than a million than a second from the beginning of the universe -- until 600 million times a second .
And all of this is just environment .
This is the machine under Ginevra .
Let 's take these min-Big Bang in the Big Bang in the reporters .
This is what I work . It 's called ATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLA
This is a spacular picture of ATLATLATLAS in building so you can see the proportions .
10 settember last year we have acceso the machine for the first time .
And this picture was taken by ATLATLAS .
It was because of immense to control it .
It 's a picture of the first of particles that had done all the LHC , both in the LHC , both in the HC , and in the HC , and spread particles in the refect .
In other words , when we see that image 10 settember , we realized that the machine was going to work , the big vitten .
I don 't know if it was this to do that , when somebody went on on Google and vide that the page was this .
What means we had a cultural impact of the scientific cultural .
And I was a week later , there was a problem with the machine , I had to have these brought here -- these block block .
These are 13,000 print when the machine works at the massive massive of potence .
Now , the technical of you will look at the fix and say , " It 's not true . I 'm sfix too sotles . "
And instead they can do it because they 're very cosiddicks .
So , at least 271 degrees , to a temperature , to the space between the stars , these blines can bring that the well-to--well--in-in-in-inference , these blind fers , these blind fairly , and you can bring that that it 's going to .
In one of the guns of the most novemile .
So the fix of the ball , and 13,000 , 3,000 practical practice , and they were just meant .
This was the result .
Now , this is still more impressive if you think that these magnetic fish are more than 20 tons , and which are moved about 30 centimeters , and which are moved to about 30 centimeters .
You 're going to be about 50 magneti .
We had to take them , what we did .
We restinated and travel .
Now , they 're going to get all to their place .
By the end of the end of the LHC will be going to be new integrate .
We 'll access it , and we 're going to be able to get data on the right data , and we 're going to keep the right right , and we 're going to find out what the morning ning ning the universe .
Now , of course , in a certain way , these incidents return the debate of the value of science and engineering and engineering in the engineering of the engineering of the engineering of the engineering of the engineering and recently .
I think the fact that it 's so hard , the fact of going to go beyond the limits , I think it 's the value of things like LHC .
I would like to end with the words of a scientist , Humphrey of the inufaces of inuseful , in difenjoy of inuseful inuseful , and his own own own own own own own , he said , " Nichael Farlera , he said , " Nichael Farm , which is , which is a very dangerous , which is not a worldry about the whole . "
Thank you .
I want to start to start thinking when , you know , children , play the morning , and you have cooking the morning .
And so you can see how to reach them and try and get them , and you 're going to move them , learn and we 're going to be able to think and solve problems and respect space .
The spactical reasoning is profth to the way we understand part of the world around us .
So , from the usually information from the ulity of our interaction with physicists , together to my consultant , and my collaborator , and my collaborator , I started to ask me , I started to ask me , " And if we 're a computer , when we use a computer , in the wusual mouse , and we 're a computer , potential , potential , you could be a deserve ve ve ve ve ve ve ve ve ve , with the digital hands , with the digital hands , with the hands , and you ,
and sistly it like ?
The question was so interesting that we decided to exploring the answer , building Siftable .
In a few words , a Siftable computer is a great interactive as a biscope .
In a few words , a Siftable computer is a great interactive as a biscope .
You can move with your hand , they can see , " you can see , " between their own movement and they have a screen and a radio .
But sostly , they 're physicists , like the morning , you can move to just crugs .
The Siftable are the example of a new ecosystem to manipulate information information digital .
And as they become more physicists , consciousness of the movement , of the other , and and they 're going to become more physics , consciousness of the other , of how we move , we can exchange to exploring new and funny interaction .
I 'm going to start with some simple example .
This Siftable is configurate to show you of video : if you put it in a direction , the video ran , the video rich , if you win the other side side .
These interactive reactive are consciousness .
If you 're going to do it , they 're interested in what 's going around .
If they 're condate it , and they can do it up a little bit .
If they 're condate it , and they can do it up a little bit .
They also have their movement and inlination .
And then we realized that one of the interaction of the interaction was to be able to use common data , to example , to example , to the study , to example , as if it was a liquid .
In this case , we have three Siftable configurate as a bunch of greattempt and I can use them to study the color , where you put it .
and I can use them to start with the color , where you do it .
If we 're too , we can put a little bit of a place .
There 's also beautiful possibility of open , like the language , like the language , and the mathematics and games where people can try to try things things things , and you see the result of the immediately , and you see the result of the immediately .
I 'm --
This is a Redwillllandle of the equations .
Here we have a words that 's going to half a game in Scarabeer and Boboble .
Pratically , at every turno re-rates a letter in every single single case of every tural , Pratically , to every turnny , at every turnable , and as you try to make a dionary .
And then , after about 30 seconds , and you have a new set of lectarch and new possibility to try .
Thank you .
And here 's how to the children came to the Media Lab , I 've done in a way I tried it and I 've been a video .
And they 're like very .
And one of the interesting things like this is that we application is that not to give you people a lot of education .
You just say , " Compon the words , and they will exactly what do .
Here 's how much people who try it .
This is our young tester than you , there 's the most young , there right .
It actually wanted to just impilling them .
They just sleep , for him .
Now , this is a very application of a interactive charge .
We had to build a tool for the appractice of the language and the Lui is Felix .
It can be new characters in the scene , sold the Siftable .
It can be new characters in the scene , sold the Siftable .
And here 's a lot of them , it 's going to use the sun .
Video : The sun is source .
David Merrill : Now , he took a treat the scene .
Video : The treor arange .
Bel work !
So , you 're standing and well-nephphils can interact the characters --
Video : Bau !
And , by inventing your story .
Video : Hio !
DM : It 's a story with the open , and it can decide he can .
DM : It 's a story with the open , and it can decide he can .
Video : Very gat , gact .
DM : The last example I have the time to show you you is a tool , I 'm going to do this with a recent , and execection .
It 's a tool , I made of recent , to slandscape and exact music .
The Siftable here are aging to sounds like , based and the bacteria .
Each of these have four different variations , and you can get to you what to use .
You can can get these sounds these sounds in a sequence from comporing .
And I just modify it just to touch a swear and a sequence . "
These are actually , you can control from the vision , like the reverber and the filtrum .
The attacks to a particular , and then inclens to travel .
And then there are the general effective as time and fly , which they actually applicate to intersequence .
Let 's look at how it works .
Video : We 're going to try and put a base in two Sift-ftable sequence , we 're going to put it in a series , we add the other base .
Now I put a ball of the bottom line .
Video : Now , I add the percussions --
Video : And I 'm going to put the filter to the bacteria , so I can control the effect from the vision .
Video : I can see , I can see the intersequence , the intersequence , or the whole way , or on the other side , or from the other side .
Video : And now I 'm going to add the filtrum to give more expression .
Video : I can recombinate the sequence of the sequence .
So I don 't have to planning it before , but I can improve , rerereturn , and I can make it fall .
And now , I can spend the whole sequence , the whole sequence , the whole Siftable to the Siftable . "
Thank you .
So , you can see , my passion is building new interfaces , and it 's always to make a new whole brain and body .
And today , I had time to show you one of this load , and some possibility that we try to take out from the laboratory .
The concept I want to transmit is that 's going to get this new generation of objects to interact with digital media digital media , which will take information in the way we want .
Thank you very much .
I 'm not going to see the now of you .
I 'm a wrote .
I 'm going to be books about this , but it 's more than this , of course .
It 's also the love and the cine of my life .
And I don 't expect that can change .
But , this is something particular successful , in my life and my career , which took me to recently me to recently the interial with this work .
The particular thing is I 've written this book , this biography called " Mandia , Pra , " which , I was the diversity of my precedenter , for some reason I was going to be a big sensational , and it 's going to be a big sensational , bestler .
And the result is that anywhere you 're going to , people like I 'm going to be construct .
It 's true -- you know , you 're construct !
They 're going to be all worried and say , " You don 't have a fear of you can 't do it better ?
You have no lifeth to write for all life without able to create a book that can be able to create a book that can be able to make a book that can be able to make a book that can be able to make a book that that can be able to create a book that can be able to create a book that can be able to create a book that could be able to make a book that we can be able to create a book that ? "
which can be important to somebody ? "
It 's unsure , you know .
But it could go worse , at the end of the most of the years ago , when I started to say , I was a wrote , I was a wrote wrote .
I was going to inagainst the same reaction .
And people said , " Do I don 't have to be able to have success ?
You have no fear that the millights killed you ?
You have no lifeter to do this mestius for all life without anything about it has ever been out and dead of a movococcurring with the board of friend of friend , and you can sle-ble-s-le-lead . "
So , you know .
The answer -- the short answer to all these questions is , " You . "
I 'm like all of those things .
I 've always had a fear .
And I also fear of a lot of other things that people can 't have to .
As the algae and other things .
But , how much about the write what I thought and I would say , and I would say , I 'm going to do that ?
It 's rational ?
It 's logical that anyone to waiting to be spent to be spent by a job that you 've been doing .
But what is we 're so specific in the impressive and creative to make us about the health health health of the forward , and so , you don 't do ?
How my father , for example , he was a chemical engineer and not remember about one time in his 40 years of activity where the 40 years of activity where they were asked to be engineering ?
There was never -- that was -- that blown of the engineer John , how ?
It didn 't work so , what ?
Onestly , the engineers like group , like a group of people have no certainly , in the searticles of being alcolized , to be alcolilized .
We have a reputting enough , and we have enough to have this reputation , but it 's just a lot of insticult , we have this reputation of a huge institute .
And it 's not about the other that look at the tribe of the magnifments of the magnifments that only , in the ventuum century , they 're dead young and often for their hand .
And even the ones that you don 't have to be so so they 're really disrying from their dunes .
Nman Mailer , before I 'm going to die , in the last interview , " Our book , " Our book , I 'm killed a little bit about the work of your life .
But we don 't bate when we hear this because we 've heard these things so much , because we 've heard these things in some way we 're completely interiorized and accepted the notion that creativity and the ctual are in some way , and it will always go to the hold , and it will always be to the hold .
And the question I want to take all of today is , you 're doing this idea ?
And it 's good to you , because you 're going to go from a centimeter of me , it 's not good for anything .
I think it 's odious .
And I think it 's also dangerous and I don 't want to see the last century .
I think it 's better to encouraging our big creative minds .
And I sure that , in my case -- in my case -- in my case -- would be very danger to start to be sleeping out of the way of support , sound the circircircircircircircircumststances where I 'm in my career .
Of course -- insum looking at , I 'm pretty young , I have about 40 years .
I 've got about four decades of work in me .
And it 's very lililived that anything I writing now , it will be right from the world as the work that I work that I used to do this success of my last book .
I 'm going to slavery , because we 're all more or less friends here -- it 's likely that my big success .
Oh , Gesus , who thought !
You know this is the kind of thinking that leaders to start to start to bay in the morning of the morning and I don 't want to do it .
I would keep going to keep doing this work that work we 're going to do this work .
So , the question is it , how ?
And so it looks , after a lot of reflections , which the way to work to keep write is that to create a psychologic costroypsychective , right ?
I had to find a distance of security , I 'm write , and my natural anxureity on what I writing is going to be able to get out of how to do this , as I 'm trying to do this in the time , to try to find out of time , trying to find other society to see if they could have the best ideas and more sane , and more sane , and more sane , and more sane , and more sane , and I 'm going to see if they could have the best ideas and then I 'm going to do that . And I
how to help people believe people create inerent people create inerent risks of creativity .
And that research me to the Great and Great and the Rome .
Seguitem because I 'm given in certain and then handscreen .
Nantical Great and the Great and Rome -- people don 't seek to believe that creativity is that creativity was in men , OK ?
And it was thinking about creativity was this spirit , and that was that they were indeed with men from a few people who were known , and they were known , for instant , for reasons and unknown .
The rying these becomes to these writes of creativity . "
Socrate , amazing , he believed to have a demon that elargness from away away from far far away .
The Roands were of the same idea , but called that a spirit of the spirit .
which is great , because the Roands , because the Roands didn 't really think that a genius was somebody particularly smart .
They think they were a genius that was a kind of degrees that were living in the murs of a argue , a little bit like the elfum Dobby , and that they were income out of the argue and models the result of the artist job of the artist and models the result of that work .
Here 's the well--- here is the distance of which is the distance of the psychological psychologic that you protected to your work .
And all they knew that was so that it was going to work , right ?
So , the artists were protect to certain things , like , for example , as for example , no ?
If you 're exciting you couldn 't take it all the deserve , you all of the wavails , all of course , they were helped by this genius .
If your faild , it wasn 't all collie , right ?
Everyone of them who was your genius to be a inhandle .
And so people han creativity in Occident .
And then the Rinascition came and all changed , and nacts this big idea ; we put the human being on the center of the universe on the winner and without more leave space to creatures that they writing out of the windouvinity .
This was the kind of of humans and the rational and people started thinking that creativity was completely by the ilifeter .
And for the first time in history , you 're commense to this or that artist , as a genius , like a little bit that person with genius .
And I have to tell you , I think that was a big mistake .
I think I allow somebody , a simple person to believe that you can be like a reciplant as a recipient , the essence and source you have , unknown to the fruit , you know , inknown as a foundable and you have a very big ble-hand-like , and it 's a very big blel .
It 's like to ask someone to sun the sun .
Deform and deform of the ego and creates all these ingestylifetime about performance .
And I think it 's been in the pression to have an artists in the 500 years .
And , if this is , and I think it 's the question is , and now ?
Can we do it ?
Maybe I 'm going to get more antical comprench of human relationship between human relationship between human relationship and mistery creative .
Or maybe no .
Maybe we can 't cell 500 years of thinking about a 18 minutes .
And there 's some people in the audience that would be lawyers on the notion of scientific , on the notion of , you know , how they following people in the projects .
I 'm going to be all about this thing .
But the question I would like to take is -- why no ?
Why would you not think about this way ?
Because it 's more than any other thing that has ever heard to explain the explanning of the creative process of creative creative process .
A process that , as anyone who ever been tremendous , so , all here -- it 's not going to do something -- so , you don 't understand rationally .
And , in fact , it can sometimes seek completely paranoral .
I 've done this inagainst recently , and he said that 's going to have a very few years , but that 's been a poeter for all of life and said that I was in the Sural , and he said that during her infants in the camps , and it was going to be in the camps , and it 's going to hear it from the pathesium .
He said , I was like a fragriculation .
And that was going to come to her from her landandscape .
It 's going to feel , because it would be able to tremending the land under her feet .
He knew that was to have one thing to do that point and it was , " War how a math . "
And so it would correct home and it was going to be a little bit of a piece of card and a little bit of a piece of card and a cymmit , and it would take it up , and it would take it on page .
Sometimes I could not be enough enough , so he would correcreceive and correcrecreceive and correcreceive the house and the poeth-handed and she was loved and she would keep the lower and he would keep the landscape , trying , like , like , " another poeet . "
And then there were those times -- this piece of not dimentichy , I 'm going to never -- there were some of the moments where it was so lost , right ?
So , he was going to go home and she was trying to take a little bit and I was going through it , and he was a math in the time , and then said , which was like , and then he was like it , and then he was like to the other hand and I was hold .
I was going to get the poesia from the coda and reput it in his body and translation was on page .
And in these cases , the poem would be presented on the perfect , and intact , but the last word to the last word at the last word .
So when I feel thinking -- it 's exactly like I 'm paper , it 's exactly ugual at my creative process .
I don 't have a game game -- I 'm not a cyyle .
I 'm a mule , and my way to work is ; you 're going to see it , and I 'm going to go on and I 'm going to be there .
But even I , in my headaggin my testing , I 've been paying with that thing , sometimes .
And I think that 's also a lot of you have the han .
You know , even if the work and ideas would come from a certain source , you can 't honestly , you know , I could be sleep .
And what is this ?
And how can we relate it in a way way we don 't do it , but rather , rather , what makes us us to make us ?
So , as I 'm about , the best example , I have the musician , which I 've been the musician , which I 've interviews different years ago for a newspaits , for a newwspaper .
We were talking about this , and you know , Tom , for the most of life is the incarnation of the argue of the arem of the argue , to start to control , to cause , to cause these species of impults .
But then I 'm going to cut , and I 'm going to go to a little bit of a Los Angeles , changed all of him .
It was going to go through a little bit of a sent . This little fragement of melodia , which comes in his head as it does the inspiration , and the woote , and the desidth , and it wants , you know , it 's the desididth , but it 's not like it .
It 's not a piece of card , it doesn 't have a math region .
So I started to feel this kind of old old old , " I 'm going to lose , and I 'm going to lose , and I 'm going to sessionate by this sessionate sessionate .
I 'm not good enough and I can 't do it . "
And instead of going to go to the panic , you stop .
I 'm going to put the whole process and he did something completely new .
I 'm just going to look at the sky and said , " Scell , I 'm not going to do ? "
" Who does it be write a song now ?
If you really want to exist , you want to be a bit of a moment when I can take me me about you .
Some triments , you know , to the qualcandandle another today .
You see to disturbing Leonard Cohen . "
And his process changes es es .
It 's not the work , the work was still still obviously .
But the process , and the fish that was that he was releave when he was press and the genius , the genium that was out of him out of him , the genius that was going to go back back to where it was , and it 's going back to where it was , and it was going back back to where it was , and it 's going to go back to .
but it 's not Tom , wonderful bizarra , wonderful bizarra , and this thing that was not Tom and this strange and the outside that he was not Tom .
So , how I felt that story to change a little bit about how I was working , and I 'm going to save me .
This idea , I was going to save me when I was write " Mandia , " and I 'm going to do , and I 'm going to cave me when we 're working on something and we 're working on something and we 're working on something and we 're working on something and we 're working on a disaster , which is going to be a disaster .
It 's not just good , right , the worst book written .
And I started thinking about geck this project .
But then I remember to Tom I talked about the air and I try .
So I went to my face on the slea-s-ress and return my commitment of the room .
And I said to you , " Sundyes , what , both , you 're going to be a brilliant not going to be my , no , no ?
Because I 'm going to see it all I have , I don 't have this .
So if you want you to be , you have to tell you and do your part .
OK . But if you don 't do it , you know what , I don 't do .
I 'm going to write the same because it 's my work .
And I 'd like to do favor that was recorded that I 'm presented to do my part of the North Africa , and it 's like this , OK -- slaught-people have been dundances for danances of the dances of the hands of a bunch and music , and the music music , and the music that would go back to the alba .
And they were always magnifer , because the ballerins were great and they were fantastic .
But every very , so , something happened , and one of these artists become actually transcuth .
And I know what you 're talking about , because I know what you 've got you view , to a certain point , a performance so .
It was like , if you stuck , and the ballerwalk through a kind of land-fall , and it was not doing anything else , and it was all all of the time , but it was all all the way , but it was going to get .
And in the improviously , as a human human .
But it 's going to come into the fur and the divinity of divinity .
And when this happened , you know , the people knew what was called her .
They were the hands and start dotare starting to dotare , " Allah , Allah , God , " God , God , " God , " God , " God , " God , " God , "
That 's God , you know .
And the West note -- when the More invaser the south of Spaign , I was this abitude with their and the pronuncles changed in the seual Allah , Allah , " Ole , " " Ole , " " " " " " " Ole , " " " " " " " The " " " Ablah , " " " " " " " " " " " " " Alah , " " " " "
In Spaign , when a artist did something impossible and magnic , " Allah , Allah , I was good , " " I was good , " incomprensible , I was a last , a last , a last , a gave God .
And it 's like we need .
But , the problem comes the day after , for the ballerself , when you sweather and discover that are the 11 of the morning of Martedday and last last .
It 's just a mortal with gran handle , and maybe we can 't be able to be able to make that altel .
And perhaps nobody will you say , " God still , and what has to do with the rest of his life ?
It 's hard .
This is one of the most pain of recognize to make a creative life .
But maybe it has to be so ange , if you can 't believe , if you can 't believe , and that the most extraordinary , which is the most extraordinary than you can .
But you 're just creating that you 're data in presticle of this team of your life that you have to go with a byourself , you 're going to go with something else when you finite .
And , you know , if we think about this way all changes .
And so I started thinking about , and it 's sure as I thought about how I think about for different months , in the book that will be able to be on , the dangerous , waste , waste expected , the exissive , I 'm going to be followed in my big successful .
And what I have to keep me when I feel I feel I feel it 's not going to do .
It 's not just to just your work .
Continua to presenting you for your part , any can be .
If you 're going to ball , you know .
If you go to the divine , asasassigned to you with a few kind of wonderful , for a moment , to just through your le-foreeds , then " Ole ! "
And you get the same .
And " Ole ! " You know , you know , you know ,
I think I 'm going to have to teach it .
" Ole ! " You just just to you have the human human love and testing to make you human human tal and make you represent .
Thank you .
Thank you .
June Cohen : Ole !
As I 've already been talking about some of these projects on the genome of the genome of the genome of new new blood of genes .
Now , we 're starting a new percourse , we started digital biology and now we 're going to start that digital biology , we 're both in biology , designing and wintecking and intetize it 's going to be in a new phase of biology , and wintetize .
We always tried to take a big questions .
" What is the life ? " is something that many biologists have been tented to understand varards .
We tried different approach us , and we reduced to the minimum .
We 're digital digital from almost 20 years .
When we sequentioned the genome of the world was to go from the analogical world of the digital biology to digital world .
Now , let us ask , how can we regenerate life , or create new life from this digital universe ?
This is the map of a little organism , the Mycoplasma genitalium , which is the species from the genome that can authorem in the lab .
And we tried to reduce the genome to create a little bit more small .
We can eliminate a hundred of genes of about 500 .
But when we look at its mapolic map , it 's relatively simple than our .
I think it 's just just just .
But when we look at all the genes that we can eliminate , one of the time , it 's very improbable that this can take a living cells .
So we decided that the only forth to progreed this chromosoma , so we decided to be able this chromoundying the components to take some of these fundamental questions .
And so we started the adventure of " Can we can sintetize a chromosoma ? "
Can the chemical conhear of these big molecules that we never have to create before before I 've ever been able to create before I 'm now ?
And in case , we can make a chromosoma ?
A chemical cycle is just a piece of material , inerte .
The speed that we 're able to digital life is growing to the life is growing to remajor .
Our ability to write the genetic code , instead , instead of slowly , but it 's really better .
And our most recently result to a curve exponential .
We started more than 15 years ago .
The process has requires , start with a bioetc revision before we start the prime experiments .
But we found that synthize DNA is very hard .
There are thousands of thousands of machines in the world that producers , the world that produces , of the long , of the world that 's a degenerative process : the most mistake .
So we had to develop a new method to assemble these framments and correcrecreceive the mistake .
And this was our first tentertainment , in the digital information of the genome of the genome of the genome of the 274 .
It 's a little virus that killed .
We designed the fragments , effectuated the correction of DNA , and get a molecule of DNA , and we get a molecule of DNA .
The interesting part is when we took this piece of chemical material , and we put it in the bacteria , the bacteria , the bacteria , the batteries , and the projecties of the particles .
The viral particles are then releave the cells , they 're back and they were back and they have destroyed the Excles .
I 've been talking about the recent with membrane of the oil industry , and they 're going to be able to do this model .
They have more than you .
We believe that this is a situation where the software can really build its same hardware in a biologist .
But we wanted to do things things in the greatest .
We had to build the whole chromosoma of bacteria .
I 'm more than 580 mile lectards .
So we thought we built it into casss of the virus , so we can change the casss to understand that they are the components of a living cells .
The design is crucial , and if we start with digital digital information in a computer , these have to be very accurate .
When we sequenced this genome for the first time in 1995 , the standard was of a mistake for every 10 mile ,
We found , we resequency , 30 mistaining . If we used that sequence never been able to do that .
A part of the process is designing segments , 50 lecking that you 're slegs with all other segments of 50 lectary to build substicles to build sounds and more tiny things that work together .
Let 's get the whole thing here .
You 're going to be blify that we 're going to be a big .
Think about this : we have a genetic code on four lectarch : A , Gs and T.
And you know , you know , they put about 20 adicyacids , and there 's a specific order to read every friend of the lectarms of the account .
So we can use the genetic code to write words , frases , writers ,
What we did with the beginning is autography .
Some of the fact that it wasn 't a poem .
We designed these segments to be just just just only one to me with the end .
There are a tiny that they repush them .
And we started assemble to assemble of parts , start with segments from five to seven mile , unending , unending up to 24 mile , unending the ununununended to them , and they 're going to get 72 mile .
We 've got these segments in the block so we 've been sequency to create a very very very robustoking approach -- as you 'll see in a minute .
We 're trying to automatize the process .
So , this seems to the tabellone of the board .
When we get these very long , much more than 100 miles , more than 100 mile , we don 't grow up to the E.
It 's going to get the modern of modern biology .
So we 've been considered other mecdoctums .
We knew about another mecchanism called recombination omologa , which in biology is to use DNA DNA , which we could use the segments of unting segments .
Here 's a example .
This organism , called Deinococture radioop--radiopad , you can assudden three million radiation .
You can see in the square sorts of how its chromosoma is destroyed .
In 12 -- 24 hours , it 's exactly like it was before .
They 're going to be thousands of organisms that are able to do it .
These organisms can sit completely .
They can live under vacuum .
I 'm absolutely sure that life in space , and you feel splaces to find new environments of water .
And the real , NASA showed that this is .
This is a image of molecule that we built with these approach , just using these approach , just using the liquid design to reverse .
The lifeters assemble .
This image is not been taken with a microscope , but with a microscope , but with a microscope .
It 's a molecule , so big that we can see the with a microscope .
These are pictures that are doing a period of six seconds .
This is the publishing that we 've done a little time ago .
I 'm more than 580,000 leck code .
It 's the biggest molecle of a defined defined structure from man .
It has a lot of a molecular fish , 300 million .
If you 're going to stamp 10 without spaces , you would like 142 , you want to be 142 to transformer this code .
Now , how do do we work work ?
Obbball , a virus is a game from bottom .
It 's a little bit more complicated when you use of bacteria .
It 's more simple when it 's the cells , it 's the cell eyyards like our , you can just be the nuclear nuclear and inseries another , which is basically the process of clonation .
In the bacteria , the chromosoma is , we 're integrated in the cells , but we 've been able to do a bank of a complex trailer of a cell cell cell cell , and it 's going to another and activity .
We 've been a chromosoma partment from a microbial species .
The two different as men from the topes .
We add some gene in more way we could decide what to do for this chromosoma .
The landed with the enjome in a way to kill all the proof the proins .
And when we put it in the cells is stupendo-- and you 're going to open our graphic sophphphotom -- the new chromosopher -- the new chromosoma is going into the cells .
And we were really thinking we couldn 't go beyond , but we tried to spinger us in there .
This is one of the most mecdoisms of evolution .
We found that very much species have added a second or a third chromosoma from some of the way , we add gend in a second thousand new tracts to the species .
So , who think about evolution as a gene and the time you have to modic gene , it doesn 't understand it .
They 're going to be called me " enced me , it 's going to be digit digit .
The chromosoma that was in cells , not one .
The cell phones we have inserito----------cell cell cell cell cell cell .
It 's expressed , and it has recognized the other chromosoma , the fairly , and we 've got to come with just the cells and the new cells and the new cell and the new cell and the new cell and the new cell ,
It 's become blue because of the genes we 've been serious .
And in a short leep , all the characteristics of a species are going to lose , and it 's transformed in a new species , based on the new software that we 've been insered in the cells .
All the proof the proof changes , and when we 're going to read the genetic code , and when we read the genetic code , what we transfted .
Now , this may seem aly-genetic , but altering the software DNA , we can change things in a very , very , very , very , very , unlike ,
Now , I 've been explain that you don 't talk about genesis -- but I 'm going to start by three million years and a half million years and a half of evolution , and I said that maybe we 're going to create a new version of the exhihihilosion of this digital process .
Why do you do that ?
I think it 's obvious when we think about our need .
We 're going to go from six billion and a half billion people in the next 40 years .
Right to give a example : I 'm nated in 1946 .
Now there are three people on the planet for each one of the planet for each here , there will be four .
We 're going to find the problems now , water fresh and pite and a well-well-up and a half billion people .
It 's going to be more than billion it for nove billion .
We 're going to be more than five billion carbon , more than 30 billion baries , more than 30 billion baries .
That means that cent millions of baries a day .
When I call it biological approach , or any kind of process to repay them , it will be a huge challenge .
We have to keep the whole emission of CO2 from these material material that we have to the atmosphere .
Now , because of the scientific discoveries in the world , we have a database with about 20 million genes , and I like to think that they are designed about 20 million genes , and I like to think that are the future .
The electronic industry , you just just a dozen of understanding , and think about how much different things are out .
Our limititites here are the kind of biologists and our imagination .
Now , we have a techniques , because of these metods synthetization , in order to create what we call genomics .
We can build a big robot that can produce a big robot that can produce a million of a day .
Think about these 20 million genes or to try to get these 20 million genes or cles , new well-to-bles , new vaccines , we can change , thank you to change , thank you very small team , and create more biology , and create more biology , now that in the last 20 years of science .
And it 's just a standard selection .
We can sleep for possibility of survival , or chemical or of carburant , production of well-vaccines .
This is an instantanea of some software programmed that we 're working to be able to several and design species of design .
Well , we don 't need to be .
We know exactly how genetic code .
Now , we 're looking on the carburant of the fourth generation .
You 've seen you that you 're going to be an experiment , they were a wind .
We 're going to be carbon and third generation that will be used enough to sssat at the zooks , as the either , they 're going to be a different different type of butanol .
But the only way the biology can have a big impact without increase than the food , and limititargument would transforming the CO2 in matters , and the limit would transforming the CO2 in matters , for designing cells that can be reach , and we think of it 's going to be able to be able to make this , and we think of the fourth of the 18 generation .
The solar solar light with the CO2 is a metodo-- but in our discoveries in the world , we 've found different metods .
This is a organism we 've described in 1996 .
It 's in the ocean , at about 2,500 feet of the foundity of the water .
They 're going to get from CO2 , using idrogenius as a source of energy .
We 're trying to figure out if we can indoor the CO2 , which can do , you can do that if we can be transformed to be a traming of the CO2 in carbon , to make this process .
So , we think we could be able to increase what the question is about to aumentate what is life is the basis of the basis of you , we know -- we have the modth of rephire the intera industry of the oil industry .
Exactly . If you don 't do it from TED , where you can ?
It would be a main source of energy .
In the way , we 're working for the same metods to create vaccines .
You 've seen this year with influence , we 're always going to go back and a dollar in less when it 's going to find the vaccine .
I think what you can change with a fle-combinable .
And so this is how the future could start changing , now , the trees of evolution , and I 'm going to accelling the evolution with batteries , archight , and infinally cells .
We 're so much from the improve people .
Our discovery , so we do it to live enough to try to get it . Thank you very much .
First of all of you 'll show you , the most fundamental job , some fundamental work that we 've taken to Microsoft with a year ago . This is exactly . This is Seadragon . This is Seadragon .
It 's a environment where you can interact is to local level that you can interact with a huge amount of data .
And here we 're seeing a lot of gabyte of digital photown with a kind of phoom and continuous , for a fast panoramic . And we 're going to be .
And it doesn 't matter how big amount of information that we see , how much information that we see , how big data or data or images .
Most are common photographers , but this for example is a profound scansion of the Congress , and reenter in the gyourself , and reenter in the gm of 300 megapixel .
It 's not a difference because the only thing that limits the prestations of a system like this is the number of pixel on your screen in any moment . It 's a very ffffly flessible .
This is a whole book , of data , like data not images .
This is Casa desolated Dickens . Every colonna represents a capitulation .
And so I 'm going to show you you that 's just about images , we can do something like this , to see what it 's about a real real representation of the tunch , not a picture .
It could be a little artificial to read a little bit a electronic book .
It 's not about it .
This is a more realistic example . It 's a number of the Lodian .
Every picture is the beginning of a seition .
And you really really like to you and the beautiful experience of the laws of a review , or a ball of a review or a quotidian , which is for nature , which is for nature of a half a half .
We also made something with the angle of this particular number of the Lodian .
We created a ball of the resolution -- much more than you 're using a normal adversus of what you 're used to do with a normal publishing .
If you want to see the carlay of this car , you can see here .
Or other models , or even specific techniques .
And this really shows some of these ideas to eliminate the limits of the skills of the screen .
Let 's hope that it means to put a few p-up and other porcherie similar , no should be necessarily .
Of course , the map is one of the most obvious applications for this kind of technology .
And on this doesn 't want to lose time , if we don 't say that we have to the field in this field .
These are all the streets in the United States , you 're going to go on on the NASA .
So now we go to something else .
This is actually from the Web ; you can go to see .
It 's a project called Photosynth , which combine two different technologies .
One is Seadragon and the other is a visual research in the computer very interesting computer computer computer computer .
And it 's from the Wb , I managon Seadragon .
You can see it when we do this kind of screens , where we can go from another image to another image , and we can be solution .
But the spach of the images here has actually actually a meaning .
The algorithms of visualization of computers have registrated these images together , so that they corresponse to places , and you 're going to be all of the argument of the Montagne Rococcious . And you 're going to be screen . Here you see the drucies of a imagining imaging of a pan-stage imaging imaging imaging .
I don 't know if I have a few other environment .
And there are a lot more and more space .
I want to go directly to one of the original data of Noah-- and this prototype of Photosynth that we 've done for the first time , to show you what we 've done for the first time , I 'm going to show you what I think is really the assuit is really the chiad . And it 's not necessarily observing the first time we 've been looking at the web .
We had to worry about the launch and forth .
This is a rebuild of the cattedral of Noter Dame pictures , and I 'm digital digital digits in Flickr and you get the pictures of the magic , and you get pictures of these are , other campus and get out of these coni .
So I 'm all of images and Flickr and I 've got all connected to this .
And it 's possible to navigate this way .
You know , I would never have been thinking about to do for Microsoft .
It 's very gratifying , you get this kind of accooking here .
I think you can see that it 's a lot of different type of focus on the cell phone : from those phones of the SLR , a meaning , a meaning , a meaning , in this environment .
And if you can , I try to try to look at those more strange .
Many of them are blogged by doing it , etc .
Some of a series of photographers -- it 's a series of photographers -- it 's a series of photographers -- it 's a series of photographers -- it 's a series of photographers .
This is a Noter of Dame registrate .
We can go from the physics of this environment .
The essential point is that we can do with social environment . This now is taking data from the internal data , from the internal , from the internal point of the ground , from the visual point of view -- and connected all those data together .
All those pictures become connected together , more than the sum of the parts of the parts .
You have a model of the earth of the Earth .
Think about this as a prolungation of Stephen Lawler on Earth 's Earth 's virtual .
It 's something that grow in complexity , as the people use , and the people who are going to use it .
And they 're marcate with metadicated with metadicals .
If you get the idea of to be able to be all these sle---by-out of the name of Noter D. . I can use how much of those data , and I can use how to use it as a style , and I can use how much point , and I can use it as a kind of a chair experience , and have a social experience of the red experience of the blinlink of anyone , and you 're using the kind of use .
Of course , a consequence of all of this is virtual models of every time of the land , which is not just to live and pictures of pictures , and by pictures and pictures of pictures and similar images and similar pictures .
Thank you very much .
Chris Anderson : I realized ? What your software is you have to do is that to do is that , in the next few years , all the photographs , all the photographs , if anyone in the interor interial improve ?
BAA : Yes . What 's doing it is to find out .
It 's creating hyperlink , if you want , you want , you to be a images .
And it 's doing it in the base of the images .
The thing is really really interesting if you think about rechemile information semanties that many of these images are going to do .
As you do a research research on the web , you digital a phrase and the text on the web has a lot of information about images .
Now , what happens if you connected to all your pictures ?
So the amount of interconnection , and the amount of rchemistry and the amount of rchemistry that 's really huge .
CA : Blaise , it 's really amazing . Complimits .
BAA : I 'm going to thank you very much .
One of the most lights when you go and one of the suck of the search of search is the order of the anti-tradier , which has the most most traditions , which you have the past the vent , the past the wind , the spent , the wind the splies of the plant , the wind the sphere of the plant .
Basti thinking about the sciamans Jagar vian , and the willllar , or which the monitites of the anthes of the anthror , or that in Himalaya , the budddououble , the good , and the idea that the world 's going to be a very much of the central Dharma , and the idea that the world 's the idea that the world 's just a sense of the world , but it 's just a model of reality , but it 's just a model of reality , but it 's the whole model ,
the consequence of a particular bunch of choices that our stype has done , well , a lot of generations ago .
And , of course , we share the tractive .
We all all of them . We all try .
We 're subjects to start .
We need to dead the inexorability of death , so we don 't surprising if we 're going to leave and wheel --
We all have a art .
What you want to do is the particular song , the rhydropping of every culture .
It 's not about the world of the forests of the Borneo , or the following of the Vodoor of Haiti , or the desert Kaisst , or the desert Kaisslly , Curch , or a camereras .
He was my company , the company of my journey in the desert of a month ago , or a block of the world .
All these people are teaching us that there are other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , other ways of moving in the world .
And if you take a moment , it 's a concept that can give you hope .
And then , the myriad of the world creating a ragnote of life spiritual and cultural cultural cultural and cultural deal , which is important for the well-being of the planet as biosphere , as biphera .
And you can think about this ragnote cultural ragnosphere and you can call the the exhibbs the sum of all the concepts , and the inspirrational , intuitions , intuitions , intuitions , intuitions , intuitions , intuitions , intuitions , and the intuitions of the consciousness of the consciousness of all the concepts of the conception of the concepts ,
The etnosphere is the fantastic fetnosphere is the fantastic thrimonstry .
It 's the symble of what we 're and what we can be in how much much species .
And because the biosphere was a gravingly consumed , as it 's successful , and it 's really fast .
No biologist , for example , would say , 50 percent of all the species is on the orest image of the exintion just because it 's a fast , or the most apocalm -- in the field of the biologic diversity -- in the field of the biologic diversity .
The indicates of this is , of course , the language language .
When you were there there were 6,000 languages on this planet .
A language is not just by a vocabolary or by a grammicals of rules .
A language is the spirit of the spirit of human spirit .
It 's the half of which the animum of every culture comes in in the material world .
Every language is a forest of mind , a backin , a wild , a very clear ecoystem .
And of those 6,000 languages , as we 're in the Mterey , at least the least half the hour , it 's not ssurroundly in the orchie of children .
They 're not teaching kids , the children , the which means , to less than this is , which is not going to do .
What is there more tribe more of being available to be the silence , of being the last to talk about a language , of not how to transmit to put the saggeon of the wanticipate ?
This is a few of the world of somebody in some of the world every two weeks , every two weeks , every two weeks and door with sis in the tools and a kind of an antical language .
And I know what somebody 's going to tell you " It 's not better ?
The world would not be a better place if you 're talking about all the same language ? " Benissim , then we all talk about yoruba .
Let 's talk about kogi .
You 'll see a tract thing thing that means not to talk about your language .
I would like to do you to do a journey --
a little journey in the etnosphere to give you a source of what we 're lost .
Many of us deal that when I say , " different ways of exist , " I mean , " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " different ways of exist .
Let 's take for example , the Barasana , in Amazonia , the popular of the anacond of the anaconda , which creates the myth of lats of latest , which creates the measure of the wall of the sacon-sacond of the wand-slats .
It 's a popular popular that it 's not going to distinguess the blue blue , because the time you 're identify in the forest , which dipends the popular popular .
They have a strange language and a major remonial , " examial examial language , " You have to you save a different language .
And all of this has been in the mitologist , but it 's the particularity is that in these families and extent is that you 're talking about six or seven languages , and because of the matrimmmers , no one practice .
They limited to listen to and then start talking .
Let 's take one of the most interests with which I 've lived , the Waorani of Ecuador , a popular popular popular popular , a popular popular that had the prime contact in 1958 .
In 1957 , five missionary , they have a conducting conducting a mistake .
They did it to go from the top photographs that they were reported to leamichevolve , deal , depludly that the popular of pluvial pluvial .
They have to be the picture from the land , they have been going to take a shape or a shape , and they were not going to find out of anything , they would conclude that the diavy , and they killed the five missionary .
But the Waorans don 't kill the strange .
They killed with them .
54 percent of the mortality was caused by their own .
We 're sitting on eight generations and we found two of death , and when we 've been sorts of dead , they 've been inveced that one of them was invective , and then they killed it , and then they killed it .
The crugs were able to recognize the animal from 40 steps and recognize the species .
In the early 80s , I was assigned a very interesting compassium when my professor of Harvard , if I wanted to go to Haiti to Haiti to go to Haiti to the chemical , and the Tonton Macocover and Tonton Macocover , and immedian arch of the wilbie .
So , I would give a sense of the mythraoloun culture , I would have to buy the Vodoo is ,
It 's a pretty much vision .
A very interesting interesting .
If I ask you to tell me the big religions of the world , what would you say ?
Cristianesimum , Islam , Buddism , Ebraism , etc .
A continent is always left out , thinking that Africa is a sub-saharian not religious has no religious . And instead and the Vodoo is not another that the distild of these religious concepts of these religious concepts of the slavery .
What makes interesting is the voodoo is the intending between life and death .
So the vision they 're going to be the spirites .
The spirites can be invocated by the Grande Acqua , which is to the dance and they 're restitude to the soul of the vision , and the time , in the way , and it 's the following the following becomes the the becomes .
And so , in the voodoodooers , you 're going to talk about God .
We say , " We say , " Let 's say , " God . "
And from the moment you 're a spirit that you have , you can you like you , how you can you do you like to be ?
So you 're going to have these incredible events : following the voodoor in the state of the mind of the mind of the mind , you 're going to show a rather strong strengaged to the body when it 's catalized in a state of exhibition , and exciting .
You all the population I 've been lived the most extraordinary Kogi 's 's the most extraordinary of the Sierra Nevada , in Colombia .
It 's the ancient of the civilization that once once they were living on plants of the Colombia in the conquician , the popular sell , the popular source , the popular suncycle that you were herself on the plants that you were on the plant of the plant .
In a continent .
There are governments of the today today , but their formation is really extraordinary .
The young people following up with families , and they live secreating in a world of a good world of good and homber in a world of good , and hombrought into the bottom of the ice for 18 years .
Two doubts of note , I 'm going to reduce the nove of months of the agening of the mother , now are metaphor , I 'm metaphor .
For this time , they 're accultured to the values of their society , values that they predict that their preice and just their pre-fer , or to say the equilibrief -- or to say the equilibriegical .
In the expensive of this incredible ininitiation , they 're improved out and for the first time in their life , you see a age of 18 years , you see a very acactive . And in that active , when the sun the sun , when the sun sun , the sun of the hold , and that 's going to do this with the splendor . The prefer is a step , and it 's going to go back and forward .
" I 'm going to ? Proprise you have told you .
It 's study . Now , it 's to you protect it . "
They call it most of the world , and they say that we , fraters , we 're the colpevolution of the world .
This is extremely important .
When we think about the indees and environment , we 're invote Rousseau and the old story of the well-well-well-invoice is in its simplicity , and so much , and we 're going to be on with the Earth .
The windebults are not nis feeling nis indebolites .
There 's no space for these things in the palulial well-gelids of the Tibet , but because of the time and I 've created a mystics of the Earth , they created a mystic stics of the Earth , but on a wintuition of the Earth can be neighborhood , but on a little bit more sotle .
What does it mean ?
And I mean , a girl of the Ande that grow up that the mountain is a spirit of Apu that 's going to be a human being being being being being a human being being being being being being being being being being in a very different desteptains with the mountain that place , in the Montana who grow a board of rock of the mountain .
That 's the dimour of a spirit or a mineral cuth is irriffer .
What is interesting is the metaphor , which is the relationship between the individual and the natural world .
I grew up in the forests of Columbia British credying that would be table .
And I reso a human being different from my friends Kwakilokilokiutl that they believe that the forests of Hukuk and the bhere is the Chararter and the spiritish donibal and the spiritish window of the world , the spiritish that they 're going to be the ination of the world , the spiritish that they 're going to the Hamats .
If you start to think that these cultures can create different reality , you can start to buy some of their feeling sle-sense of feeling .
I 've been taken this picture to open the Amazonia .
Maybe some of you 've heard about the ayahuh , the most powerful psycoactive , the most powerful psycoactive .
What makes you like this is affactive , it 's not the potential to make it crug cycle of the chemical chemical . It 's composal with two elements .
A side , this lian launch that you have a series of carboline , harm and harm and harm , read , read , read , read , read , right now .
To take the only plants , you have a blum blum that altera little bit of the consciousness , but it 's a mychoed arch of the family of caffee Psychots , and it 's said , Psychotridis called Psychotridis called Psychotridis .
This plants of the triptamines , very similar to the serotonin , dimethyltryptamine-5 , methyptamine , methypttiny .
If you 're going to see Yanomami , you 'll be a different set of species , which do from a different kind of kind of kind of , and it 's contains .
And so you can see that pollust on the hidden is a little bit like to a slepink of the by-eyes and lifetry on a sea of electricity .
I wanted to do with my professor , Richard Evan Shultes , the man who has been swebbbbychic , with his discoveries of the fungi , with his discovery of the fungi , in the ' 30 in Mexexico .
And I 'm not going to classificate these tripllamines like the hallucinated because if you 're done you 're not going to tell anyone of them . [ Risate the triptamine , and it can 't be sunced because they 're denily denly in the intestin the intest , but it 's in the winter , and it 's dyase-diases .
It 's possible to assumerle orally if you sunte with other chicals that denian denial .
Now , it 's the beautiful : the Wil-carboline , which are in this lightens of the MAr , the same kind of necessary to potential the triptamine . The question question is ssors . The question is , in a flour hour , like these popular dies , like these people find out of two departically , but if you combinindeed a version of the willlant , but that 's the neighborhochemical version of the sum of the sum that ?
We use the big eufemism of the prove and the mistake , which can reveiled .
But if we ask the Indian of the Indian , we 'll tell us " The piant . "
What does it mean ?
This tribes , the Cofan , has 17 variety of ayahuash , which distinguess they would be born in the forest , and that you can get in the same species .
If you ask how to stbilify their tassonoms will tell us , " I thought I was about how much , I 'm not going to know . "
The solution is : you take the 17 variety of the land-land-leep , and each other .
With this doesn 't have to Harvard , but it 's much more interesting that contact the stami .
Now , [ [ applausi ] the problem is that even the problem is that we have to heart the people find out of the world , but in some way , in some way , you know , in some way we 're going to the margins of the real world , and it 's beyond .
In fact , the Xst century , it doesn 't have to remember for his innovations , but it 's not going to make the innovations of technologies , but rather as the deal with the mass of the biologist , and we 've been active or accepted destroroy-based , the problem of the planet . Now the problem is not the change .
All the search through the sears were involved in a new life .
And the problem is not the technology .
The Indians are not stay in Sioux , when they put it out of the arch and fly as American people have no stopped in the American , when they put it out of the hold and calculate .
It 's not the change or the technology that mindate the etnosphere . It 's the power .
The domination of the domination .
And if you look at the world , I 'll find that these are not cultures of the world , you 'll find that these are uncultures .
They 're creatures and dynamic spinte out of existence , which will be beynamics that will go beyond their skills .
I 'm going to sleg of the Penan Thanks of the Penan --
a popular of Sarawak , in the s-asian , a popular popular popular , a popular popular , and the destitution of the forest , and now redocction to the servitus , where you can see the figrive of the fight-to-wth Cinese , where you can see the Mar Cinese Mran , where the Merian Pinese Merve Mer. Cinese Mrrr.
You 're to reempize the styy-up wood sound .
Or , in the case of Yanomami , are the disease that are the disease that are the discoveries of the gold .
If we 're going to move on the mountain of Tibet , where I 'm doing a lot of research , you 'll see the last political domination .
As you 're going to know the genocide , the physics of a popular popular popular , but the wilddness of the well-indy-life , not just as a popular popular popular , but it 's a dought of the development , because it does part of the development of development .
And you can 't understand the suffering of Tibet , because you don 't get out of the beginning .
I 've been very , 6,000 miles from China China Western China through Tibet , I come to Lhasa with young young old old old old old old old , but just came to Lhasa young ague , but just came to Lhasa statistics that we feel about .
6,000 monuments sacridots in pollust and cenjoyers .
1.2 million people killed by military , the military ,
The father of this guy was ascritical to Panchen Lama .
What 's that means that it was killed to the Chinese invasion .
Her is , I 'm going to be with Santity in Santity , in Nepal ,
His mother was impried and his collie was to be rich .
It 's been taken by hidden in cars of the age of two years , you could not live under her gonna because it would not live without him .
The source , which did the same , it was mitted in the field of reeducation .
A day has inversion calculate a wrote of Mao and , for this transgression , it was a smoved in the several years .
The pain of Tibet can be inspirit , but it can be inspirit of the popular popular .
Afall , you get to a choice .
Let 's want to live in the world world world world 's the pollying the world polymath , or we want to account the poly-diversity ?
The big anthropologists Mead , before he died that his biggest ble-hail was that , in our own own view , we 're not just going to see the whole view of the world , not just see the whole gyourself of the human thinking , but a day you 're going to be a limited .
And it 's a million dollars that our species is exist for 600,000 years .
The Rivolution Neolitical , which has given us the agriculture , which has been there to fight the ball of the seme of the seme of the seme of the slander , creating the calculation of specialization , and we 're talking about 10,000 years ago .
The modern world industry has been in 300 years .
That 's a story that we have the risk of me , we have the risis that we 're going to have all the challenges that we have to deal in the millennia .
When to these myriad of cultures of the world is asked what you want to be human , respect with 10,000 voices .
And it 's in these answers that we all sell the possibility of being what we 're , a consciousness , which has to do , you have to make all the people in the windows . And there are big moments of optimism .
I 've been taken this picture on the extremity of the hour Elyland , when I went to caught with the whenever I went to the whenever , and this man , and this man told me me , and he told me me the wonderful story of his grandfather .
The government downny is not always sending with the Inuit and the ' 50s to stay our suprematia , we 've got them in colonies .
The grandfather of this man , you 're going to go .
The family , I 've got to take all the time , and I 'm going to take all the time , and all his attle .
You have to know that the Inuit , they don 't have the cold , they 're going to do it .
The ball of the sledge of the sledge of the ball of caribus .
The grandfather of this man had no intimistake , or from the library , or from the library , which was sitting .
It 's sgattle , you 're calculate the pantalone in the skin of phoca and defeck , when I did it do it , you 're congelate , the worked a bama .
It 's got salive on the points of this colphone , and when it became solid , and when they come to , she was killed a dog .
It has been taken the dog and created a brillighter , with the cases of a slethids , has imbrillilify another dog , colphone phone .
Let 's want to talk about cavarselling with nothing ? [ Risate . And this , in different ways , and [ Applail .
In 1999 , 1999 , the government chanadd has redying the Inuit , the total control of an area of territory and Texas a big well-riter of the California and Texas med together .
It 's their new paper . It 's called Nunut .
It 's a independent . Controlate all the resources of the mineraries .
One splendido example of how a national natione-state can recognize with his popular popular .
And , I think it 's pretty obvious at least at least at least at those remote of us , and then you know that they 're not going to remote .
For somebody 's home .
They 're going to be severtions of human imagination that rish of the time . And for all of these children , like the dreams , like the dreams , like the swide of the wall-geography of hope .
In the way , we have Geographic , we 're convints that politicians never come to anything .
We believe that the polemies --
[ [ Applausi ] not loss , but we think that the stories can change the world , and maybe we 're the better institution to tell the stories of the world . Omese world 's the first 35 million lived .
156 Paesesis transmit our television .
Our revide million people are letters from millions of people .
Our work is to travel in the etnosphere to bring our audience in places of wonderful cultural culture , which will go through the block of how they saw and , you hope , abbracing , and they will be able to the reveiling of diversity , and we have to find a life in a diversity , and we have to find a life in a pluralist and then the ultural world 's going to find a plurch and the world of the world , and we have to find of the grivelist and the world of life in , and we 're going to find of the world of the dden , and we
where the saggeity of all the people can contribute to our well-being calculation .
Thank you .
I 'm going to talk about some things I wrote in this book that I hope you 've heard and proverse you 've been going to proverse some connections , in the case , you would have to deal with some connections , in the case , you 're not going to be able to be able to you some things that I 'm going to be going to be about about some things that I 'm going to be able to proof the mind .
I would start with what I call the dogma dogma "
The dogma dogma ?
The dogma dogma , of all the West industrial society , the West dogma , " If you want to massive the well-being of our citizens , " The way to do this is massimilar to do that is massimilar to do that is the individual . "
The reason is , in fact that liberty is in fact that liberty is in the fact that liberty , is really pretiful , essential to human beings .
And the other is in fact that if we 're libers , each of us can act for all to do to do this , which is the benefit , no one who decide in the name .
The way to massive liberty is massive choice .
More choices people have , more libs , and more more , and the most of their liberty , the most of their well-being .
This , I think , it 's so profoundly in society that nononobody would be able to put it into the short bull .
And it 's also deeply royed in our lives .
I 'm going to show you some examples of what progress is possible .
This is my super-----handdouble .
I lost a simple note on condition on the inforeer .
In my super-----condition , without constay 10 variety of olive , and the 12 aceti , and 12 aceti , you can buy for a huge conditions that you can buy for a huge condition of the inreserves that one of 175 , you 're going to be a huge condition of your degrees .
Here 's the super----market .
And then you go to the neighborhood to buy one stereo : you 're sleep , bull , piac , the lefer , the lefer .
And in this single negogodal , there 's a big number of components .
We can make six million and a half million different combinations using components that there are just a neighborhood .
You have to admit that there is a lot of choice .
Onnnets : the world of communications .
And once , when I was a child , you could get all the services of telephone , to pat pat the pat that were force to mom Bell .
It was a phone , you didn 't buy it was to buy it .
A consequence of this , between the other , it was that the phone don 't just just just just like .
These are going to go .
We have a variety of telephones , specially between the phones , specially between the cell phones .
Here 's the cell phone .
My favorite is in the middle , P3 , tapeli of the hidden , and the blood of the by-bleg .
If you have a single seen in the negodden , you 're bought to you .
And what 's happening is that people go into the negots and it 's the question . And you know what is the answer ? The answer is " No . "
It 's not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn 't face .
So , in other aspects of life that are much more important of the fetime of the things that are very much more than you choices .
Axxbloothcare : not the United States that you go from the doctor and the doctor you have to do .
Instead , I go from the doctor , and the doctor says , " Okay , we could do A , or B , " A has these benefits and these risks " B , these well-handed ball , and these risks . What do ? "
You know , " Dottore , what should I do ? "
And the doctor says , " A has these benefits and these risks , and B has these sweather and these risks . "
" What do you want to do ? "
And you rebits : " Dottore if you were , what would you do ? "
And the doctor : " But I 'm not . "
The result we call it " autonommy , " expression that makes it seemed to be a beautiful thing .
But in fact , it 's not that one to move the fish and responsibility of the decisions that you know something , you know , it 's the doctor , to qualcanother than any other -- and it 's not about it 's a herereror to take decisions .
There 's a huge marketing of products , you can 't get people like me and you , and you know , if you think you can 't buy them , because you can 't buy them , because you can 't buy them .
But if we can 't buy them , because they have a public public public ?
The answer is that they want to doctor to call the doctor to ask us to change us to change us .
And what we 're so fundamental as our identity is ever a question of choice , as you see and in this vivision , " We don 't want to ssell children . Scease their sx will be able to the right now . " We need to invent it .
And we can reinventing us how many times you do it .
The thing that means that every morning , you have to the risk , you have to be .
I 'm going to spect the family and the matriage , a time the common , smart of anyone , it was that you would be the most as possible , and it was going to start the most price , and it was going to get the more price .
The only versuit was with who , not when you , and it 's not when you do .
And so , it 's really to play .
I 'm going to start very smark of smark , and I do 20 percent than a time .
And it 's not because they 're just just just like they 're not deal .
but because I 'm impensive , I mean , I would say , " Would I save me or no ? I would you do this now ? "
" Do I would you get to me more later ? I would think before I have to go to career ? "
They 're interrogatives .
And they try to answer these questions , even though this implment doesn 't be able to companies and not get a good vote and I don 't get a good vote to my exact .
And they have to do this . They 're important questions .
Now , the work : We 're lucky , like Carl , because the technology has to work every minute us , every day , every day , from every day , from every day , from the the Hotel Randolph .
I 'm going to talk , there 's a angolin , and I 'm not going to tell anyone where , the WiFi Fi works .
I 'm not going to use it , because I want to use it .
What does that mean , this incredible liberty that we have about work ? It 's that we have to keep , keep going to keep , if we have to work or not .
We can go to see our son child play , with cell phone , with cell phone in a cell phone , the Blackberry , and the notebook , and the noteme , and the notears .
And even though I 'm all spent , every minute that we see our child , we 're also asked , " Do I said , " I would answer to this called ? "
" I would answer to this email ? I have to answer this letter ? "
And also when the answer is " no , this makes the experience of your son very fun of your son very fun from what would be in other conditions .
So , as you look at , little things and big , objects , and big materials and life , life is a question of choices .
And once the world was this : Ovreal , there were some possibility , but it wasn 't a question of choice .
The world of today is , the world of this : The dilemma is , " It 's a positive thing , or negative ? "
The answer is Sought .
The positions you know , we know , so I 'm going to talk about the negative .
All this choice , two effective , two actually negative effective on people .
The first , paradoxtisically , is that makes you freedom .
With tant options , you get very hard to do this .
I 'm going to give you an example : a conduct on the pians of fairly .
A connected my own data has access to the data of the Vanwhile , the gigantic society of a foundation , with about a million clients of clients in 2,000 different companies companies .
What she found is that for every 10 solutions that are offer , the percentual percentual , the percentual of adesion , two percent .
With 50 sour-s-source , there 's 10 percent of adesions than they are available to when they are available . Why ?
Because with 50 sour-s-source , it 's maledly hard to decide , and the choice is remanaged to the indeed .
And to start , and again , and I still smorrow , and of course , and of course , and of course , and of course , and we 're still sleep .
You can 't just just that these work from the old old old , because they will not have enough money because they don 't have enough money , you want to say that the decision is so ostyystics that allowed the foundator of the dator of the dator of the dator of the work .
I 'm not talking about , they 're losing , they 're lost to five dollars for a year from the datest , which would be brought them .
So the paraliis a consequence of having a hoods of choices .
And I think that 's the world so .
" And to finish , for the eternity : ketchup , " Does , "
You would take the right decision , if it 's for the right decision , right ?
You don 't want to save the wrong , and you don 't know the wrong condition .
So this is the first effect . The second is that we also have to evookay , and we do a choice , at the end , we 're less sophisted by as we were being with less options of the fer , which you walk .
And this for different reasons .
A of these is that with a lot of condition , which you can do , if you buy a and it 's not easy to imagine that you could do a choice that you could do a choice that would be better . And what happens is that the alternative imagination is that the alternative imaginated with the sophister of choice , and the rephip the sophation of the decision of the decision , and the desppphip of the decision , and it 's the repphip of the decision , and it 's decision of the sophation of the the the the the the the sophation of the sosoon , and you
And when it was a good decision .
More choices , there 's more easy dislilify of any detail that is insophisting of option .
In the way , there 's what economists call it expensive opportunity .
Dan Gilbert has closer very well , how the value we 're going to depende with what we 're going to depend on what we 're going to depending on .
And so , when there are a lot of options , it 's easy represent represent the characternative of the alternative arch and be less soddatic .
And so , I 'm a example . I 'm all of New York .
But it 's probably what you would probably think .
There 's this pyypy of the Hampons .
A place of lusbs .
And it 's sweather . Ottma . It 's all about them .
It 's not slow . But what he thinks is , " Well , malyction , it 's Agoam . "
" All my neighborhood , I 'm going . "
" I could talk about it right right in front of your house . "
And I 'm going to spread about the idea that 's loss -- every day -- every day -- the possibility of parking where you want .
The expensive opportunity to the soddisfation for what we have , even when the choice is was a cell .
And the most of the options we have to look , more the characteristic characters will come to how expensive opportunities .
Here 's another example .
This is telling us a lot of things .
It 's about living the time , and maybe in the time , and maybe in the living lenter .
But the most important point is that you choose , you wouldn 't do the other .
The things that we don 't take a tremendous attractive that can make less attractive what we do .
Third point : spiral grow of expectative .
I tried on my bboubing a new jeans .
Porto almost always jeans .
And once the jeans were just just like , you buy and window up bestia , were discovery , just after I had to get them a life and work of a lot of times , they were start going to go well .
So , I went to buy a couple of a new when the old old were going , and I said , " I need a couple of jeans , this is my cut . "
The commit said , " Look , " Look , and fit ? "
Do you want to do with the bottons ? " Stonebottons ? "
" Look ? "
" Seight them to hold them ? Ble ble , " Where , " Continual it to elenjoy .
I was swhite , and after a little bit of it , I 'm going to say , " I want to do the kind of -- which was the only kind of like , I 'm going to have a idea of what , so for a little bit of hour , and then I 'm going to use a little bit of a little jeans that I 've ever had .
It was the massive . I 'm all the choice I had the better .
But I feel worse .
Why ? I wrote a whole book to understand it .
The reason I was worst worst is that with all the choice was very very , the jeans had to be perfect .
I was expected to me . I didn 't expected me about exciting when I was just exist about 100 different , step , at least a kind of like , but when I was going to be perfect .
What I had to do was good , but not perfect .
After I had to do that choice with what I was trying to do with what I was trying to do with expect .
The add of options in life , people don 't do that increase the expect of these have respect to the excellence of options .
And this will be going to be soddisfation , even when the result result of the result .
No one in the world of marketing , if you realize .
Because if they knew , you would not know what I 'm talking about .
The truth is to look more at this .
" You know , it was better when you were worst , " The reason I was better when you were worst , it was still possible to meet of the surprised and evolution .
Or , in the world we live -- opulents , industry industry , industry , with the fairly , the massive , the massive that we can hope is that things that we can hope is that the altel of expectative .
You never have surprised to be surprised because your expectative expanies , my expanies , I 'm unlike ,
The secret of happiness -- that you 're here -- it 's , " Bought , " Yes , " Yes , you want . "
I mean , a little bit of the car -- which I 'm really sorted and my wife is really amazing .
I couldn 't do better , I couldn 't do , I 'm not accounted .
But it 's not always a good thing .
And finally , a consequence of buy , a couple of jeans discowhere you have this kind of jeans is that when you 're not really , and you ask you " Why ? "
" Who is responsible ? "
The world is the responsible . What could you do you do it ?
When there are hundreds of type of jeans , and you buy one insophisters , and you ask you who are the responsible , it 's altreatment , it 's altreatment you .
You could do better .
With hundreds of variety of variety of variety , there are no willing for the insuccessful .
So when people take decisions , even if the result is sitting , you feel like , they feel like , and they 're sleep and they will sell up to their same .
In the last years , the depression is explose in the world industry .
I think a phinannodative -- not the only one , but important -- of this wave is really depression is that people have experiences because the standard are too allowed .
And when they have to explain this situation that the colst thinking that colst is .
So the final result is that in general , we 're better , but we feel like a worst .
Let me remember .
This is the dogma dogma , what we all take for good and it 's completely fast . It 's not true .
There 's no doubt that a little bit better than I 'm going to have a little bit better than I 'm going to be a little bit better than a little bit better than a little bit .
There 's a critical value , I don 't know what it is .
But I 'm sure we have been in a piece of the level where the choices are better than our life .
Now , from the politician -- I 've almost finite -- from the politician , the nocctum is the following .
What you can do this in society , it 's the industrial system is the rchemistry .
There are many places in the world , and you know , you know , where the problem is not that they have a lot of choice .
The problem is that they have too points .
So , so the cenda I 'm talking about is a malizusial , rich that makes a males of modern , reququoccies .
And what it does to deprimers and arrative is this : Steve Levitt . And that 's about how those expensive and discoveries of the inuseful , and they 're inuseful .
I mean these choices , complicated and available , it 's not that they 're just inuseful .
I 'm addicates .
And they 're worse .
If you have a little bit of what our society is really reversed in the society , where people have too , where people have too , it would not just have their life to improve , but our life .
This is what economists call a mix paretary .
A redistribution of the redistribution of all -- not just to poverty -- because of this choice in exceps , and you 're going to be .
And I mean , you can get all of what you want to do . "
You , people are , you think , " But what does that fish ? "
" It 's obvious that you can 't do anything in a bock of glass . "
" A re-imagination , a limited view of the world -- "
and I 've got the whole thing , I 've got the whole , at the beginning .
But then , I think , instead , I 'm recognize that that fish the long short .
Because the fact of the fact is that if you managed to frantum the bocence , so that you can 't get the freedom . You can 't get the freedom .
If you 're the bock , you can diminute the soddisfation .
You can get the paralive , and you get the benefit .
Everyone of the sphere .
This is almost too , you know , maybe even for the fish , and you know , and sure for us .
But the assudden of some symbolic sphere is a rice for infellicity and , for the druine .
Thank you very much .
