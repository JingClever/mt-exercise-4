Last year I showed these these slides to show that the Player 's calculus , which almost three million years had the size of 48 million years had the size of 48 continental .
But that 's this undervaluable to gravity , because it doesn 't shows the spent of the ice .
The arctic glacial calculator is , in a sense , the clean , the clean of global climate system .
You expanies of winter and retired of extreme .
The next slide will be a quick related to the advanced several of the last 25 years .
The glaces are signed in red .
You see , you expand until the blue .
That 's the ice in winter , which is ratch of summer .
You can see that the lower ice lower ice , five years or more , is like blood , which is like blood , which is like blood , which is like blood .
In 25 years , it 's been there , so .
This is a problem because the heat interest the heavior glacier around the ocean where there are huge carbon , where there are enormous amount of carbon dioxes , are transformed in the middle of microbes .
And it turns out that the totality of the global warming , that amount could doubling , super-scale could doubled , overcome this point of not return .
In some little bit deep in Alaska , in Alaska metane is already rebolling from water .
The professor Katey Walter of the University of Alaska , a team in a team , a team in a team , the last winter .
Video : Wow ! Al Gore : Wow . I 'm going to be good . The question is if we 're going to be .
This is that this termal exchange Groenland from the norththththroenland from the norththththwrote .
This is a glacial regime .
The layed never reached to levels them .
This is the river Kangerlussuaq , in the west of the Groenland .
If you want to know how the sea level of the sea level for the sea path of the ice land , here is where the sea .
These current are going to be very quickly .
The other part of the planet : Antartide , the largest block of the planet .
The last month scientists have dichied that the bilannotion of the ice is in negative , and that the Western Antarctica , which pogy on some iso-to-sun , is particularly fast , it 's particularly fast in the month .
It 's 2222222-miles of the sea level of the sea level of the sea level of the sea level of the sea level of the sea level of the activity , like in Groenland .
The Himalayas , the third largest block of ice , you see new laghi , which few years ago , they were glaciers .
40 percent of the world 's population half of the potail of the potail .
Sulle Ande : this glacier is the foundation of the potail of this city .
The luck is increased .
But when you decrease , the same happens to the water .
In California , the nenow , the nenow , the nenow , the 40 percent .
The idricrical kins are in crisis .
The predictions , like you 've read , you are good .
The growing secuse secups in the world , a remarkable remarkable to the inceness of the inceness of the inceness of the world .
The environmental disaster disasted to a rhythm out of the normal and without precedenting .
Four more numbers in the last 30 years , I respect 75 .
This is a whole insustainable way .
If you look at it in the historical consequences , if they can see the consequences .
In the last five years we added 70 million tons of CO2 , 25 million tons of CO2 , 25 million tons in the ocean every day .
Look at the area of the oriental Pacific , the American American , to the west , and in both parts of the continent to the parts of the substpoverty in the ocean .
The major of global warming , together to deforestation , and that 's the 20 percent , is the use of fossil combustile .
The oil is a problem , and the carbon is even worse .
The United States is one of the two countries with more emissions , together to China .
And it was proposing to build many other carbon .
But we 're seeing a way of a direction .
These are the anullated projects in the last few years and some green proposes of green veries .
Everything , there 's a political lower in our country .
The carbon industry and oil oil have spent 250 million dollars in the last year to promoting carbon , which is a oxide .
And that was a picture , I would remember something --
Natal , Tennessee , where I live , there was a 3.8 billion ligallons of carbon dioxes .
Maybe you saw it on news .
This is the largest flow of flowing in America .
It happened around Natal .
The nor advertising ads was this .
Video : It 's going to be a kind of allegro and happy .
It 's abundant here in America , and it 's growing our economy .
Frosty carbon , it 's more and more and more .
It 's good price , adorable and work , they keep the wild .
Al Gore : Froginia . It 's got a coal of West Virginia .
The biggest minerair of the mountains is Massey Coal . This is his administrator .
Video : Don Blankenship : I 'm going to be clear -- Al Gore , Harry Reid -- not know what they 're talking about .
Al Gore : So the Alleance for Protext of Clima Clima has two campaign .
This is a one of them , one part .
Video : Attore : ALergy : ALergy , we see the climate change as a sea sery to our business .
So , our priority is to invest a large amount of money in a commercial effort to make public and confused in the real real , and it uses the truth .
In fact , carbon is not pushed .
We think it 's clean -- it 's also a good profum .
So , not pre-cupatate of climate change .
Let me do it .
Video : Attore clean : Carbone -- you heard about it .
So , let 's make a lot of the horses in a structure of the pulit of the pulit carbon .
Stranspordinary ! The machines are a little rainy of coal technology , but this is the sound of carbon technology .
The carbon consumption is between the major cause of global warming , but the remarkable of carbon height that you see changes everything .
You look at a look at this , it 's the pulit of coal technology .
Al Gore : From , the positive alternative of the economic issue and the national security .
Video : Comment : America is in crisis ; the economy , the national security crisis , climate crisis .
The file that connections all of our fossil fuels , like fossil fuel , like carbon fuel , like carbon oil .
Now , there 's a new , audace , audace solution to use it .
Repower : 100 percent of clean energy , in 10 years .
A to put America to work , to make sure more certainly , and help stop the global warming .
Finally , a solution that basts to solve our problems .
Repower . It 's more .
Al Gore : This is the last one .
Video : How to report : It 's about requires to America .
One of the fastest ways of the dependence of the combustible that killing our planet .
So the future is here . Vent , a new energy network .
Noowers for two : Neggs for the bunch of work .
Comment : Repower America . It 's time to be realists .
Al Gore : A old proverbio , the African says , " If you want to go to fast , you go from soldiers .
If you want to go away , you go together . "
We have to go away , fast .
Thank you very much .
Last year at TED , I introduction to the LHC .
And promise to get back to how the machine works .
So here I went . And for those that the other time , the LHC is the larlargest scientific experiment ever that we were -- 27 kilometers of circummmulti-scientific experiment .
His task is to return the conditions that were at less than a billion people in the universe -- until 600 million times a second .
All of that is just ambiitious .
This is the machine in Ginevra .
We take these min-Big Bang in the remarkers .
This is what I work . It 's called ATLAS -- is large-44 meters and has a danger of 22 meters .
This is a spectacular picture of ATLAS in building , so you can see proportions .
To10 settembers of the last year , we acceso the machine for the first time .
And this picture was taken by ATLAS .
It was made of immense festeggams in control .
It 's an image of the first particles that he had all the LHC , entering in collision , in collision , with a part of the LHC , and spread particles inside the relevant .
In other words , when we saw that picture , we looked at that picture , we knew that the machine worked , which is a great writing .
I don 't know if it was this to exultate us more or this , when somebody went on on Google and vies the page was this .
That means that we have a cultural impact beyond to the scientific .
About a week later , there was a problem with the machine , just to these file here -- these fixes .
These files 13,000 amping when the machine works at the massim of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the massive .
Now , the technicians of you will look at the file and say , " It 's not true . I 'm file too . "
And they can do it because when they 're very cosiddic cosiddics .
So , at least 271 degrees , at least 271 , the inferior of the space between stars , these things can bring that current .
In one of the giunture of the grid of the LHC , there was a phrainy defect .
So the file of the file , and the 13,000 amping phones , and 13,000 ampefully met a electric resistance .
This was the result .
Now , this is even more impressive if you think that these magneti fish more than 20 tons , and that you 're moving about 30 centimeters .
There are damn about 50 magneti magneti .
We had to take them , what we did .
We restinated them and traveled .
They are now now coming back to their land .
And I 'm the end of the mostly in the LHC is going to be integral .
We 're going to access it , and we 're expecting to the right data or the bunch or the lude , and continue so our adventure to discover what they 're going to be the universe .
Now , of course , in a way , these accidents reaccent the debate on the value of science and engineering in front of science and engineering in front . It 's easy to the future .
I think the fact that the thing is so difficult , I think it 's the value of things like LHC .
I want to end with the words of a English scientist , Humphrey Davy , which , in defense of inuseful experiments of the pupillo , his clello , his clelly Michael Faday , he said , " Nient is so danger for progress of the human mind how the science that the idea of science of science how the report that the science of science is definition is that our own own new ways of our own own new ideas of the world 's not a new monds ,
Thank you .
I want to start asking you about when , you play cookid , play cowers .
As you can understand how you reach them and make them , take them and move , and you 're going to move them , and you 're going to be able to think and solve problems .
The space reasoning is deeply connected to the way we understand most of the world around us .
So , from the inspiring of our interaction with physical objects , together to my Pactant , and my Packing Jeevan Kalanithi , and I started asking to ask me , " And if , when we use a computer , instead of using the Couse , I started to ask ourselves , we could deal with a desktop , we could deal with a sweet , we could deal with a source information with hands , you could deal with an ent-orders ,
and how do it to our please ?
The question was so interesting that we decided to explore the answer , building Siftable .
In a few words , a Siftable is a big interactive computer as a biothing .
In a few words , a Siftable is a big interactive computer as a biothing .
You can move them with her hand , they can see , " between them , you know , hear their own movement and they have a screen and a wireless wireless .
But most importantly , they 're physical objects , like the morning , you can move to the mistake .
The Siftable is the example of a new ecosystem of tools to manipulate digital information .
And as they become more physical , conscientists , consciousness of the other , and as they become more physical , consciousness , of how we move them , we can explore new things , we can explore new things and different styles of interaction .
I 'm going to start with some simple example .
This Siftable is configured to show the video : if you 're going to the video , if you 're going to the back in a direction , video will turn it like that , if you 're going to the other end .
These interactive rates are conscious about other .
If you face them , they 're interested in what they 're around .
If they 're surrounded , they can act a little bit .
If they 're surrounded , they can act a little bit .
They also greatest and inclination .
We then realized that one of the interesting implications of the interaction was to use the common to data , for example , " a color like , " a color like a liquid .
In this case , we have three Siftable as a bunch sleck and I can use them to the color in that central , where you mix .
and I can use them to be a deal , where you mix .
If we live too much , we can put a little bit of place .
There are also beautiful possibilities of apprentice , like language , the mathematics and games where people can try to prothings fast , and you see the immediately results .
Now I 'm --
This is a Fibonaccount that I do with a equation program .
Here we have a words that 's half in the Scarabeo and Boble .
Pratically , at every turnal you get a letter in case on every Siftable , Pratically , at every Sifable to a letter in the Sifable , and as you look at any of them to be able to do with a dictionary .
Then , after about 30 seconds of the landed , and you have a new letters of reading and new possibilities to try .
Thank you .
Here 's the children came to the Media Lab , I did in a way that tried and I did a video .
They 're loved very pleased .
And one of the interesting things like this kind of appliation is that you don 't have to people many instructions .
You just say , " Compons of words , and they know exactly what to do .
Here 's what people do it .
This is our beta young tester tester , there on the right .
It actually wanted to just impilling them .
They were only only morning morning , for him .
Now this is a appliation of a interactive cartoon .
We wanted to build a tool for the apprentice of Lui language is Felix .
It can insert new characters in the scene , lifting Siftable .
It can insert new characters in the scene , lifting Siftable .
So , it 's doing the sun .
Video : The sun is smile .
David Merrill : Now he took a hold hold in the scene .
Video : The hold 's the handle .
Bel ! Yeah !
So , you know , the Siftable and put them close to interact with characters --
Video : Bau !
-- by inventing your story .
Video : Hi !
DM : It 's a story with open , and it can decide him how you becomes up .
DM : It 's a story with open , and it can decide him how you becomes up .
Video : Vola on , yard .
DM : The last example I have time to show you is a tool , made of recent , to sample and executive music .
It 's a tool , it 's a tool , to samp and exeguing music .
The Siftable here , the bass and the bacteria .
Every one of these has four different variations , and you can choose that use .
You can also inserver these sounds in a sequence that you can compories .
And it 's just just to touch a " sound , " and a sequence . "
These are actually actually actually , you can control from the live , like the reverbero and filter .
You attacks to a particular sound and then inclens to enjoyle it .
And then there are the general effects as time and volume , that they applied to the internal sequence .
Let 's look at how it works .
Video : We 're going to start with a two-path in Siftable sequence , we put it in a series , we put it in a series , we add the other basic .
Now I put a bass line .
Video : I add the percussions --
Video : And I 'm going to put the bacteria , so I can control the bacteria , so I can control the effect from the live .
Video : I can be able to quick the intersequence , by the way , or the other hand , or on the other .
Video : I 'm going to add the lower filter to the lower phild phild .
Video : I can recombine the sequence of the flight .
So I don 't have to do it before , but I can improvisate , and I can improvisate , make it over the most cord .
And now , I can spend the whole sequence on the left , the whole sequence on the left Siftable .
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is to build new mo-similar machine interfaces to how our brain work and body .
And today , I have time to show you one of the results of this path , and also some chance we try to bring out from the lab .
The concept I want to transmit is that 's coming from this new generation of design objects to interact with digital media , which will take information in our world , and we want .
Thank you very much .
I don 't see the now to talk to all you .
I 'm a writer .
And I think I 'm going to be the profession , of course .
It 's also love and the fascinating of my life .
And I don 't expect that it can change .
But , he said , something particularly happened in my life and career , that led me to report the whole .
The particular thing is that I recently wrote this book , this whography called " Mangia , Prega , Ama , " which is diversly by my precedented , for some reason used to use in the world and became a big international feelational ,
And the result is that everywhere , is , people treatment treatments treatments .
It 's true -- convicted , convicted .
They 're all about me , and they say , " Did you don 't know how to do you do better ?
You don 't care about continue to write for all life without being able to create a book that can be able to create a book that can be somebody ? "
that can be somebody that 's important to somebody ? "
It 's certainly , you know .
But it could go worse , part of the one remember , I remember that more than 20 years ago , when I started to say , I was a writing -- I wanted to be a writer .
I was going to inch the same reaction ,
And people said , " Don 't you to have success ?
Do you don 't care that the ulikely killed you ?
Do you don 't care about this to walk for all life without anything anything else that 's ever out and die on a cumulation of the wild of dreams with the blow left-up .
So , you know .
The answer -- the short answer to all these questions is , " You know . "
You know , I 'm fear to all those things .
I always had fear .
And I also have fear with many other things that people can 't inhit .
As the algae and other things .
But , for the way I thought I was thinking about and I 'd ask me , and I would ask me , is why ?
Is it rational ?
It 's logical that anyone who has expected to be spended by a job that 's song to do .
But what is that that 's so in the advanced , it 's about the mental health health health care .
How my father , for example , he was a chemical engineer and I don 't remember one time in his 40 years of activity that he asked him if he had fear to be engineer ?
There was never -- that was that , that block of engineer John , how does it happen ?
It didn 't work like that , you know ?
Onestly , chemical engineers like group they don 't certainly , in the centuries , waradagnation of being alcolized , and the depressives .
We have a writers , we have enough this reputation , and not only not just writers , but creative of all kinds of instainable to be enormous .
And it 's not to look at the sad of the deaths of the magnificments of the creative magnificments that , only in the 2th century , they die young and often .
And even the ones that are not sounds like to be really disfaced by their dunds .
Norman Mailer , before he died , in the last interview said , " Every my book killed me a little more extraordinary affermation about the work of their life .
But we don 't beat the boy when we heard these things so long that in some way we completely have interiorized and accepted the notion that creativity and suffering are in some way , and that 's going to end , at the end , at the end , it 's going to always the analygoal .
And the question I want to take to all of today is , you agree with this idea ?
It 's good , because it also is , you look at a centimeter of a distance to me , it 's not good for anything .
I think it 's odious .
And I think it 's dangerous and I don 't want to see the perpetuated in the next century .
I think it 's better to encourage our big minds to live .
And certainly , I know , in my case -- it would be very dangerous to start fuse to the sudden feeling to that the sudate of suppointed , most of the circumstances that are in my career .
It 's very good -- you look at , I 'm quite young , I have about 40 years .
I still have about four decades of work in me .
And it 's very likely that anything writing in the world , as the work that I used to go from the world like the work that I used to go after the success of my last book .
I 'm going to slavt , because we are all more or less friends here -- it 's likely that my greatest success is to my behind .
Oh , Gesus , who thought !
You know this is the kind of thinking that leads a person to start to behind the nine of the morning and I don 't want to do it .
I would continue to do this work that we do .
So , the question becomes , how ?
So , I think it seems to be , after many reflective , which the way to do to continue to do is to create a psychological construct , right ?
I have to find some way to find a safety distance of security between me , which I 'm writing , and my natural anxial of which reaction is going to be able to get to the time , trying to find other society to see if they could have better ideas and more sane to see if they could have better ideas and more sane ideas and more sane , trying to find more and more sane ideas that they could see if they could have have better ideas and more sane ideas and more sane ideas and more sane
how to help people make creative to manage emotional risks of creativity .
And that research has taken me to the ancient Grek and ancient Rome .
Seguiteating because I 'm giving in circle and then back .
In the ancient Grek and ancient Rome -- people didn 't seem to believe that creativity came from men , OK ?
And it was thinking that creativity was this spirit , and that they come to the men from a few people distant source and unknown , for reasons and unknown , for reasons and unknown .
The Great were called these spirites of creativity , the demons of creativity " demons . "
Socrate , wonder , he believed to have a elecareas that electric wisdom from far away .
The Rooms were the same idea , but called that kind of spirit without a genius .
which is great , because the Rooms didn 't think that a genius was a particularly intelligent .
They believe that a genius was this species of divine entity that he had literally sitting in the walls of an artist study , a little like the elpho Dobby , and that came out to be able to use the job of the artist 's work .
Here 's the distance -- here is the distance of which I talk -- that 's the distance of psychological construct you protects of your work .
And everyone knew that it was so that it worked , right ?
So , antiks were protected to things , like , for example , the example of the too much narcisixm , right ?
If your work was exceptional , you couldn 't take everything everything , they would all know that the wirds , all of you know that the wireless .
If your failed work , it wasn 't your whole , you know , you know , you know , if your failure , it was not your failure , you know , if your failure , it was not your failure , you know , if your failure , it was not your own , you know ?
Everybody knew that it was your genius to be a inable .
And so people han conceived in Ecccient for very long .
Then the Renurched came and all this big idea , and nacked this great idea ; we put the human being over the center of the universe above all and the mysteries and no more leaving space to creatures that writing from divinity .
This was the rational principle of humanity and the people started thinking that creativity came from from the idivided .
And for the first time in history , you start to referred to this or artist as a genius , like a rather than a person with genius .
And I have to tell you , I think it was a big mistake .
I think that allow somebody , a simple person to believe that it 's like a recipient as a recipient as a recipient , creativity and inknowable , inknowable and etheran responsibility , and inknowable , and inwiteran , and you know , inknowledge , and you can give a fragile the human human .
It 's like to ask someone to enjoying the sun .
Deform and demand , you create all these things expectations on performance .
And I think it was this pressure to have destroyed the artists in passed 500 years .
And , if this is true , and I think it 's the question , the question becomes , and now ?
Could we do it very different ?
Maybe you can go back to a more adantical understanding of the relationship between humans and mystery creative .
Or maybe not .
Maybe we can 't cell 500 years of rational thinking about 18 minutes .
And there are people in the audience that would be reading scientific sosports of scientific so-named scientific so-known , they follow people to spend the next people in their projects .
And so it 's probably not convince all of this thing .
But the question I 'd like to take is -- why not ?
Why do not think about this way ?
Because it 's more sense of everything that I 've ever heard to explain the exasperts of the creative process .
A process that , like anyone who ever tried to do something -- so , basically , all of here -- you don 't compare , you all here -- you don 't compete .
And , in fact , it can sometimes seem completely paranormal .
I did this meeting recently with the recently Ruth Stone , who has now 90 years , but that was a poetry for all life and said that during her childhood in the rural Virginia , working out in the rural Virginia , and feel it inside if a poem came from the landscape .
He said that it was like a fragorous tracy of air .
And that was rotolling to her from the landscape .
He felt it , because he was going to be able to tremendous the land under his feet .
He knew he had one thing to do at that point and it was , her , her , " to run like a mart . "
And so he 's going to hold it and he was sitting by this poem , and he wouldn 't have to take a piece of paper and a pretty quickly in the trapassed , and the mistake , and the mistake , and the mistake it .
Other couldn 't be enough , so it would like to be fast , so it and correcrecef and correcef without getting to the home and the rotolar , and he would continue to rotolar through the landscape , looking for , how she said , " another poet . "
Then there were those times -- this piece of time -- this piece I never -- there were moments where the was almost losing , OK ?
So , he was running home and he was trying to do it , and he was trying to mistake up , and he was a mark in the way that he was going , and then he said , that it was like if you walk up with the other hand and steffing .
He cutting the poethesia from the coda and reput it in his body and transported it on the page .
And in these cases , the poetry would be presented on the perfect page , and the last word , from the last word to the first .
So when I heard it , I heard , it 's exactly the same thing , it 's exactly the same thing .
Not all my creative process -- they 're not a construct !
I 'm a mulo , and my way to work is ; you know , you know , you know , I 'm going to get up at the same orarian .
But even I , in my aggin the aggin , I 've stripped that thing , sometimes .
And I think that also many of you the han .
You know , even if the work and ideas came up with a certain source you can 't west windoor wwalk .
And what is this thing ?
And how can we relate to it in a way that you can 't lose the head , but rather , rather , than , what does it remain sane ?
As I mean , the best contemporary example I have is the musician . Tom Waits , which I interviews different years ago for a day .
We were talking about this , and you know , Tom , for the majority of life has been the incarnation of the incarnation of the incareer , looking at , and domining these species of impulses .
But then he invent , he calculated , and one day , he was driving on a highway in Los Angeles , he changed everything for him .
He was going to be fast and everything with a traat of the melody framment , which is coming in in his head as the inspiration , elusive and the wild , and you know , it 's wonderful , and it 's not to take it .
It doesn 't have a piece of paper , he doesn 't have a matt , he 's not a matt register .
So , I started to hear this species of old old old old , " I 'm going to losing , and I 'm going to remarred , and I 'm going to rehold it from this song .
I 'm not good enough and I can 't do it . "
And instead of going to go in the panic , he stopped .
He 's going to take the whole mental process and made something completely new .
He just just just the sky and said , " Scuses , you don 't see that I 'm driving ? "
" Do you think it can write a song ?
If you really want to exist , you 're going to get me more opporting , when I can take care of you .
And then you go to importantly to importunk somebody else today .
You know , to disturbing Leonard Cohen . "
And his process changed after this .
Not the work , the work was still dark .
But the process , and the fish that was require was releft when the genius , the genius that he caused to be a grandchildren from the other things that was going to be , and he was going to get the back where it was , realized that he had to be a interized and removed .
but you know , it 's a little bit of a collaboration between Tom and this is a conversation between Tom and this strange and outside that it was not Tom .
So , what I felt that story started to change a little bit even the way I worked and I was already save me once .
This idea , I was saving , " Mangia , Prega , Ama , and , " Ama , and it 's fall in one of the disperation where we 're working on something and we can 't start thinking that 's going to be a disaster , which is going to be the worst book .
Not only bad , just the worst book .
And I started thinking about this project .
But then I remind to me about Tom that I talked to the air and I tried to us .
So I raise my face on the sluethed and I 'm going to make my common to a vacuum of the room .
And I said , " Sints , what , you 're both , we know , if this book is not going to be brilliant , not my mind ?
Because I 'm putting everything I have , I 'm putting all , I have no more than this .
So if you want to be better , you have to presentate you and do your part .
OK . But if you don 't do it , you know what , I don 't do anything .
I 'm going to writing the same because it 's my work .
And I want to say that it was recorded that I was presented to do my part , " Because -- finally , then , OK -- that 's so , OK -- centuries ago in Northern Africa , people would date for damly dances to the bunch of the likely to the date , and to the alba .
And they were always magnifically , because the ballerini were professionals and they were fantastic .
But every time , rarely , something happened , and one of these artists became transcendent .
And I know what you know , because I know you all saw , at a point , a performance so .
It was like if the time stopped , and the dancing walking through a kind of labor and not doing anything else from the solved , like 1,000 night before , but everything was all all the place .
And suddenly , not just appears as a human .
But it 's it from the divinity in the winity of divinity .
And when this happened , when he was , the people knew what was , called him .
They 'd like to go to dotch , " Allah , Allah , Allah , God God , " God , "
That 's God , you know .
Curious note -- when the Spain , I invaded this bunch with them and the Spain , I was this abitude with them and the doctor changed in the centuries , and you can still hear in the corrids , the rules , you can still hear in the corries or in the flamp .
In Spain , when a artist did something impossible and magic , " Allah , , " Allah , " Alah , " By , " incomprerehly , " incomprehensible , it , it 's a God .
And it 's great because we need it .
But , the problem comes up the day , for the dancer , when you sought up and discovering that are 11 in Martedesday and the last of God .
It 's just a mortal mortal with leinock , and maybe never will never get to get that altitude to that altness .
And maybe nobody will you not have the name of God , and what do with the rest of his life ?
It 's difficult .
This is one of the most painful recognized liations to be .
But maybe it doesn 't have to be so angoscious if you can 't believe , mostly , that the most extraordinary things in your being from yourself .
But you know , you just believe that they 're prested by an inimaginable source of this team that 's a sea team that you have to go to somebody else when you finished .
And , you know , if we think it 's in this way .
And so I started thinking , and it 's certainly how I thought for different months in the work of the book that I 'm going to afford , the dangerous , attesissively , attesissively , attesissively , attesinking , and it 's certainly success .
And what I have to continue to tell me when I feel electric .
It 's just your work . It 's just your work .
You can get your part of your own part , any can be .
If your work is dancing , bat .
If the divine , absurd genius to leave some kind of wonderful , for one moment , for only one moment through your effort , then , " Ole ! "
And you 're going to do the same your dance .
And , " Oh , you ! " You know .
I think and I think it 's a lot of teaching it .
" Ole ! " You know , even only for having human love and wild testing tali tali to make you continue to make you continue .
Thank you .
Thank you .
June Cohen : Ole !
You know , I 've already talked about some of these projects on the human genome , what can mean , and what can mean , and on the purposes of new genes .
Now we 're starting a new path : we started digitizing the biology and now now we started to digital code , we 're entering a new phase of biology , design and winting and synthize life .
We always tried to ask a big questions .
" What is life ? " It 's something that many biologists have tried to understand vary levels .
We tried different approaches , reduced to the minimum terms .
We 're digitizing from almost 20 years .
When we sequenced the human genome was treated to go from the analogical world of the digital biology in the digital world .
Now we ask us , can regenerate life , or create new life from this digital universe ?
This is the map of a little organism , Mycoplasma genitalium , which is the smallest genome in the lab .
And we tried to reduce the genome to create a more smaller .
We 're able to eliminate a hundred genes of about 500 genes that are here .
But when we look at his eyed mapolic map , it 's relatively simple than our .
And I believe me , this is simple .
But when we look at all the genes that we can eliminate , one at the time , it 's very unlikely that this can bring a living cells .
So we decided that the only way to progreatest the synthesize this chromosome way to modify the components to bring some of these fundamental questions .
So , we started the adventure of " Can we can synthize a chromosome ? "
Can it confeeling to produce these big molecules that we never could create these big molecules that we never could create before ?
And , in case , we can make a chromosome ?
A chromosome is just a piece of inert chemical material .
The speed that we are going to be growing up to exponential .
Our ability to write the genetic code , instead , proproproproproproproproproproprogret .
And our most recent results the recently exponential .
We started more than about 15 years ago .
The process required many steps , starting with bioetic revision before the experiments ,
But we found that synthesize DNA is very difficult .
There are tens of thousands of machines in the world that make small segments of DNA , long , long , the longer of 30 letters and it 's a degenerative process : the more the segment is , more than the segment is down , the more mistakes there are .
So we had to develop a new method to make these framments and correct the mistakes .
And this was our first attempt , to particularly digital information of the genome of Phi X-4 .
It 's a little virus that kills bacteria .
We designed the fragments , effectuated the correction of the mistakes and get a molecule of DNA .
The interesting part is when we took this piece of inert chemical chemical chemical material , and we put it in bacteria , the bacteria , the bacteria have started reading this genetic and viral particles .
The viral particles have then been released by the cells , they come back and they destroyed .
I talked to recent with membranes of oil industry , and they 're saying that they 're certainly understood this model .
They have more than you .
We believe that this is a situation where the software can really build his same hardware in a biological system .
But we wanted to do things in big .
We wanted to build the whole chromosome of bacteria .
They 're more than 580 miles of genetic code .
So we thought we made it in the size of the virus , so that we can change the cassets to understand what the cassets of a living cells .
The design is crucial , and if we start with digital information in a computer , these have to be very accurate .
When we sequenced this genome for the first time in 1995 accurategy was a mistake for every 10 miles .
We found , we were resequenced , 30 mistakes . If we used that original sequence never been able to do that work .
One part of the process is design that 's a 50 leckers that are very long to reach with all the other segments of 50 letters to build underneath the smaller that worked together .
We try to unique elements here .
You probably read that we 're going to read that we put in the filiquid .
So we think that we have a genetic code based on four letters : A , C , G and GDs and T.
Three of those letters together codificate about 20 amminods , and there 's a specific order to letters for every friend .
So we can use the genetic code to write words , frasases , thinking .
What we did at the beginning is autographed .
Some have been dollar from the fact that it wasn 't poetry .
We designed these segments to just only only only only only to only only only only with enzymes .
There are the enzymes that they repair them and put them .
And we started assembly to assembly , starting with segments from five to seven miles , and engments in a way to form segments , 24 miles , and they only only only only to get to 72 mile miles .
Everything we made these segments in abundance so that we can sequence them to make an extremely road -- as you 're trying to create an extremely robusto-- as you 'll see in a minute .
We 're trying to automatize the process .
So , this seems the tabellon a basket .
When we get these very long , more than 100 miles , more than 100 miles , they will not grow in E.
You get to the modern of modern biology .
So we looked at other mechanisms .
We knew about another mechanism called recombination omologa , which in biology is to repair the DNA to repair the DNA to unite to unite the DNA to unit .
Here 's an example .
This organism , called Deinococcus radioduring , it can absorb three million radiation .
You can see in the upper square like his croromosome , the destroyed .
In 12 -- 24 hours it 's replaced as a before .
There are thousands of organisms that they can do it .
These organisms can sit completely .
They can live under empty .
I 'm absolutely sure that life exist in space , and you feel to find new rich environments of water .
In the real , NASA showed that this is .
This is an image of molecule that we built by using these processes , just using this labor design appropriate design of the segments to insert .
The lights assemble them .
This picture wasn 't taken with a microscope with a microscope electric microscope .
It 's a molecule that we can see it with a microscope .
These are pictures that covers a period of about six seconds .
This is the advertising that we did a little time .
They 're more than 580,000 letters .
It 's the largest molecule of a defined structure from man .
It 's got a 300 million molecular weight .
If you stamp it with a caratter 10 without spaces , you 'd like 142 pages to transcend this genetic code .
Now , how do we work ? How do we do that ?
Of course , you 're tramed a virus is a game from kids .
It 's a little more complicated when you use bacteria .
It 's simply even when it 's the eucariote cells as our , you can just extract the nucleo and put another one , which is basically the process of cloning .
In the archaea bacteria , it 's instead of integrated in the cells , but we recently demonstrated that we are able to do a complete transplant of a cell cell by another cells to another and activate it .
We can clear a chromosome from a microbial species .
The two are different as men from the topes .
We added some genes more so that we can decide what to do is to decide what this chromosome .
The skied with the enzymes to kill all protein .
And when we put it in the cells , and you will appreciate our own sophisticatooes -- the new crum is going inside the cells .
And we started thinking that we couldn 't go beyond , but we tried to push us more than that we could spinger us in there .
This is one of the major mechanisms of evolution .
We found that a second , we 've added a second or a third chromosome , add in a second thousand new traits to that species .
So who think about evolution as only one gene , it doesn 't have any good at the time of biology .
They 're going to be the enzyme called restriction , which adverse digerating the DNA .
The chromosome that was in the cells , it doesn 't .
The cell phones that we put it up to the chromosome , it has the way .
It express , and it recognized the other as express as express , the other as the summed material , and we found with only the cells and the new cell .
It became blue because of the genes we put .
And in a short leaving time , all the characteristics of a species , you know , and it turned all into a new species , based on the new software that we put in the cells .
All the proteins have changed , and membrane have changed , and when we read the genetic code , exactly what we 've transfitted .
Now this may seem altering altering , but altering the software , we can change the things in a fundamental way .
Now , I 've already explained that it 's not about genesesis -- but of progress to start from three million years and a half million evolution , and I said that maybe we 're going to create a new kind of a new version of Cambrian exhibition where they create new species on this process .
Why do that ?
I think it 's enough obvious when we think about our necessity .
We 're going to move from six and a half billion people in the next 40 years .
Just to give an example : I was born in 1946 .
Now there are three people on the planet for each existing in 1946 , there will be four .
We 're having problems now to find food , fresh water and clean , medicine and clean , medicine and well-half billion and a half billion people .
It 's going to be more than to do it for nine billion .
We use more than five billion carbon carbon , more than 30 billion baries .
That means a million baries a day .
When we try to find biological processes , or any kind of process to replace , it will be a huge challenge .
We have to keep the whole of CO2 emission of these materials that 's going to end in the atmosphere .
At the day , thank you to discover the scientific discoveries in the world , we have a database with about 20 million genes , and I like to think they are the design components .
The electronics is only a dozen about components , and think about how many different things come out of .
Our limitations here are the data that is actually a biological reality and our imagination .
Now we have techniques , because of these rapid synthetization , in able to create what we call genomics .
We 're able to build a million robots that can produce a million a day .
Think of processing these 20 million genes or to optimize the processes to prove eight-up , new vaccines , we can change , and we can change , we can change , because of a little team , and create more biology now that in the last 20 years of science .
And it 's just a standard selection .
We can choose for survival , chemical production or carburant , production of chemical , production of chemical vaccines .
This is an instantaneous instantaneous software programmed that we 're working to be able to sitting and design species to do .
Well , we don 't know how it will be .
We know exactly what their genetic code .
Now we 're focusing on the fourth of the fourth generation .
You see even even you can extract ethanol from the gran experiment .
We have carbon on , and third generation that they 're going to use enough to the blood of carbon than the higher value as the eight-up or different kinds of butanol .
But the only way the biology can have a big impact without increasing the cost of food and limitargue would transforming the cost of food and limitarne would transforming CO2 in matter before , so we 're working to design cells that can achieve the cells that can achieve this purpose , and we think we can have the first carbon , about 18 months .
The solar light solar light with CO2 is a metodo-- but in our discoveries , we found different metods .
This is a organism that we described in 1996 .
It 's about 2,000-footage , about 2,500 meters of the ebollidge of the water .
They create metane from CO2 using hydrogen molecular as a fource of energy .
We 're trying to understand if we can incanalate CO2 , which can easily be transported through the tramed , to drive that CO2 in the carbon , to drive this process .
So , we can be able to increase what we could be able to increase what the basic question of " which is our life " Noothing , greatest , we have the hot goal of the replace the oil industry .
Exactly . If you can 't do that from TED , where can ?
It would be a main energy .
And also , we 're working for using the same metods to create vaccines .
You saw this year with flu , we 're always going back to the flu , and with a dollar when it comes to find the right vaccine .
I think what you can change by building vaccines in ancient advaccines .
Here 's how the future could start looking like , now , the tree of evolution , accelerating evolution with synthetic bacteria , archy , and initially , an eucariote cells .
We 're so much from improving people .
Our purpose is to do that , we can live enough to try to do it . Thank you very much .
First of all I 'm going to show you , the most fastest work , some fundamental work , of the new technology that we brought to a buy almost a year ago . This is Seadragon .
It 's a environment where you can interact with a huge amount of visual data that remote with a huge amount of data of visual data .
Here we 're seeing a lot of digital picture of digital photographs with a kind of expensive phoom , and then for a fast fast spelling , and we 're going to .
And it doesn 't matter how big it 's the amount of information that we see , how big this is the amount of data or images .
Most are common photographs , but this is for example , is a scanning from the Library of Congress , and reenter in the gamel of 300 megaxiel .
It doesn 't make any difference because the only thing that you have the prestation of a system like this is the number of pixel on your screen in any time . It 's also a very flexible architecture .
This is a book , interior , for example of data not images .
This is the Casa desolate of Dickens . Every colonna represented a capital .
To show you that it 's just about the text and not images , we can do something like that , to actually see that it 's a real real representation of the text , not a picture .
It could be a way a little artificial to read a electronic book .
You don 't know it .
This is an example of the most realistic . It 's a number of the Guardian .
Every picture is the beginning of a section .
And it really gives you the pleasure of you and the becomes to the real version cartacy of a magazine or a quotidian , which is for nature molteplant .
We also did something with the corner of this particular one of the Loook at the Guardian .
We created a higher advertising ads -- much higher than that you use in a normal advertising ads in a normal advertising .
If you want to see the characteristics of this automobile , you can see here .
Or other models , or even the techniques .
And this really shows some of these ideas to eliminate the limitations of space on the screen .
We hope that this means to put up to the end of a pop-up and other things , like , you don 't have to be necessary .
Of course , the map is one of the most obvious applications for this kind of technology .
And on this is not going to lose time , if we don 't say that we have contribute to give in this field .
These are all the streets in the United States , there 's a geospace ,
So , we 're going to go to something else .
This is now actually from the Web ; you can go to see it .
It 's a project called Photosynthrowing , which combine two different technologies .
One is Seadragon and the other is a very interesting visual computer for Noah Snavely , a student of Steve Snavely , a student of Steve Seitz 's aid of Microsoft Rick Seitz and Rick Szeliski . At a optime of Microft Research . At optime .
And it 's from the Weadragon .
You can see it when we do this kind of pattern , where we can go from one image to another one and have this kind of experience , and have this kind of multiple solution .
But the space collocation of here has actually a meaning .
The algorithms of computers have recorded these pictures together , so that corresponding to the real places that correspond to the real places that I imagine -- all of these things are , and you 're sitting on the Magne Rocking doadesi-- they 're scatten . Here you can tell you the elements of a de-show or imaging .
I don 't know if I have time to show you some other environment .
There are some more space .
I want to go directly to one of the original data of Noah-- and this is from a precedent prototype of Photosynthrowing that we 've done for the first time the ext ext . And to show you what I think is really the key key to show you what I think is really the key key to the check . And it 's not necessarily evident that we put in the environments that we put in the website .
We had to worry aspects and forth .
This is a re-built of the Notre Dame pictures of Nototre Dame images and Flickr . Bao digitch Notre Dame and get pictures of the sorts of light , and the other of the campus and on the campus , and by saying . You have a picture that is discovered to this model .
So they 're all related pictures of Flickr and they 're all related to this way .
And it 's possible to be able to be able to do this very simple way .
You know , I never thought I would be working for Microsoft .
It 's very gratificent you get this kind of acking here .
I think you can see that it 's a lot of different kinds of fotoxes of photos : from those of the phones to those SLR , a meaningful number , put together in this environment .
And if you can , I try to look at those strange .
Many are blocked by faces , etc .
Some of some part here is a series of photographs -- here .
This is a poster of Notre Dame recorded .
We can move from poster to the physics of this environment .
The essential point is that we can do things with social environment . This is now taking data from the properties of how the Earth 's collective memory of how it looks like the Earth , from the sight , from the view , from the view of visual view -- and links all these data .
All those pictures become linked together , more than the sum of the parts .
You have a whole land model of the land that emerging .
Think about this as a prolungation of Stephen Lawler on Earth .
It 's something that grows in complexity as people use it , and the people use it , and the advantages to increase with the use .
Their pictures are hushed with inseries of other people .
If you can somebody 's the idea of contradication all these sorts of things to be the name , my picture of Notter Dimprovised Dimprovised to be required to be able to use this , and I can use how to immergerms to the scale , and I can use the picture of anyone else , and having a little bit of a kind of cross-to-user experience .
Of course , a consequence of everything that 's what 's what we 're extremely elecaborated models of every interesting part of the Earth , you can 't just alive it from alive and satellitaries and similar pictures , but by the collective memory .
Thank you .
Chris Anderson : I realized ? What your software is that your software is that you can do is that at a certain point , in the next few years , all of the picture , all of the photographs are going to be clink together ?
BAB : Yes . What 's doing is basically discovered .
It 's creating hyperlink , if you want , you , in the pictures .
And it 's doing it in the base of the pictures .
The thing becomes very interesting if you think about wealth of semantics information semantics that many of these pictures are edding .
As you do a research on the web , you digit a phrase on the web page , has a lot of information about the picture .
Now , what happens if that picture you links all your pictures ?
So the amount of semantic interconnection and the amount of wealth is really enormous . It 's a classic effect of the network .
CA : Blaise , it 's really incredible . Compliments .
BAA : I thank you very much .
One of the main pleasure when you travels and one of the ethnographics , is the able to live between who has no forgotten antial traditions , among the past , the wind , the wind the wind , the tools of the wind , the wind it in the wind levigate , the leververt-balls .
Bastes think that the sciamani Jaguar vision beyond the Via Lattea , or that the advance of the ancient Do Inuit , or Himalayas , the buddists still in the respair of the anthropology , and that the idea that the anthropology of anthropology , and that the idea that the world in which we live in which is not , but it 's only a model ,
the consequence of a particular adaptative set of adaptative choices that our estrpe , many generations ago .
And , of course , we all share of the essential tracts .
We all have . Everybody probelieve .
We 're subjects to start .
We have to dead the inexorability of dead , so we don 't surprise us if we 're going to smile ,
We all have a art .
What it 's the particular song of the song , the rhythm of the dance of every culture .
It 's not the people who are the Polests of the Borneo , or the Curander of Haiti , or the desert Kenya , or the desert Kenya Septentrional , the Curander of the Ande , or a cammelt in the Sahara .
And he was my journey of journey in desert a month ago , or a aleat of Qomolang-lifestrace in the values of Qomold , the world 's mother .
All of these people teaching us that there are other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , other ways of moving in the world .
And , if you think , a bad concept that it can give you hope .
In the world , with myries of cultures of the world creating a spiritual of spiritual life and cultural life that 's important to well-being of the planet and it 's important to the well-being of the planet as the biosphere .
And you can think about this ragnosphere , as an ethnosphere , and you can defining the etnosphere , and it can defining the extra supply , all , the mites , intuitions , intuitions , intuitions , intuitions ,
The etnosphere is the fantastic patriage of humanity .
It 's the symbol of what we are and what we can be in how inquisitive species .
And because the biosphere was gravously consumed allowed to the etnosphere , and very quickly , very quickly ,
Nothing , for example , it would say that 50 percent of all species is or is on the orders of the extinction , just because it 's fake , or -- in the highest ipotesthesis , or -- in the highest issue of the most optimistic ispocalm -- that the most optimistic -- that the cultural diversity .
The indication of all of that is , of course , language losing language .
When you were born 6,000 languages on this planet .
One language is not just a vocabulary or a series of a grammical rules .
One language is the sprar of human spirit .
It 's the middle of which the animal of every culture is in the material world .
Every language is a forest , a backin , a thought , an ecosystem , a thought , an ecosystem ecosystem of the possibilities .
And of those 6,000 languages , as we are here in Monterey , at least half the half of the half of the horeck in the orches of children .
They 're not teaching kids , the people who want to say , unless you 're not going to chak something , which are already died .
What is more sad than you 're having the silency , of being the last to talk to a language , the human language , the wisdom of the wisdom of the savailable to the wissue of the children ?
This is a few of the world 's state of somebody in the world every two weeks , every two weeks a old old old , a half a weeks of an ancient language .
And I know somebody who 's going to say , " Don 't it ?
The world wouldn 't be a better place if we talk about all the same language ? " Benissim , then we talk about yoruba . Let 's talk chance .
Let 's talk about kogue .
You 'll see a tract thing that you can 't talk about your language .
I 'd like to give you a journey through the etnosphere .
a little journey in the etnosphere to give you a kind of what we 're losing .
Many of us forget that when I say , " different ways of exists , " I mean , " I mean , " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " different ways of us . "
We take for example this Barasana Barasana , in Amazonia , the anaconda , the anaconda , which creates the mid-sandwich snars of saconest sacond in the west panx of sacond sacond sacond .
It 's a popular people who can 't distinguess the blue blue blue from the green , because the moves is identified in the forest , which depends on the forest , which is depends .
They have a strange language and a major marriage , detailed exogamia , " examist " You have to marry a different language .
All of this roots in the past mitological , but the particularity is that in these expensive familiar with marriage , and they 're talking about six or seven languages , because of the mystons of the mysts .
They 're limitate to listen and then start talking .
We take one of the most interesting tribes I lived , the Waoran Ecuador , an incredibly popular people who have the early contacts in 1958 .
In 1957 five missionaries have a made contact mistake .
They did from high photographs that they were reported to them in a friend that they were going to be lowing , forest that this people of the forest pluvial forest pluvial .
They collected the land , they turned the research , they turned it to the research of a shape or a shape , and , not finding anything , they were going to be the hell , and they kill the five missionaries with the lance .
But the Waorani doesn 't kill the strict .
They kill them between them .
54 percent of the mortality was caused by their own .
We 're sitting at eight generations and found two cases of natural morath and when we insisted to know , they loave a lot of them , they aged that one of them was aging , and then they were killed , and then they were killed , and then killed it .
The crude were able to recognize the 40 steps and recognize the species .
In the early ' 80 , I was assigned a very interesting task when my Harvard professor asked me if I wanted to go to Haiti to Harvard , if I wanted to go to Haiti to the base of Duvalier and Tonton Macope cope , and impossessing about the lead , and impossessing of the flikely .
For a sense of miracolder , I should understand the Vodn culture , and that Vodoo is not magic .
It 's quite a very complex , metapphysics of the world .
Very interesting .
If I ask you to tell me the big religions of the world , what do you ?
Cristianesimum , Islam , Buddhic , Ebraism , etc .
A continent is always left out , thinking that Africa has no religious feels to religious feels . And yes and Vodoo , and the Vodoo 's not the other than the distilside of these religious religious concepts in the tragic sea slavery .
What makes the interesting voodoo is the intense rate between life and death .
So , you know , they hide the spirits .
The spirits can be invoced by the Great Acqua , they respond to the rhythm of the dance of the dance of the vial , and they replace the way that for a little bit of active the following becomes the becomes to the becomes the becomes to the becomes up the becomes up the becomes to the becomes up the back of the back of the back of the dance of the dance of the dance of the dance of the dance of the dance of the dance of the dance of the dance of the dance of the dance
So , for this voodooists like to say , " You white , you go to talk about God .
We say , we love in the time and we say God . "
And from the moment you 're married , is the spirit that you , how bad you do you ?
So you 're seeing these incredible events : follow vote in the state of trance , which touches are impunted to be a rather strong demonstration of the power of mind , when it 's catalyzed in a state of extreme , excited about the power , when it 's catalyzed excitation .
Those all of the people I lived the most extraordinary Kogi of Sierra Nevada in Santa Marta Marta , in Colombia , in the Santa Marta .
The advantical civilization that once they lived on the caraight on the caraibia , the people were going to be on the major of the people in the securring of the major , the people source on the massive volcanic planning .
In a continent macked continent , this people never been conquyed by the Spanish .
But now , they 're governmented by a clero , but their formation is really extraordinary .
The young people followed away from the families to three or four years , and they live sitting in a dark world , and sitting in a world that 's made of buy and hitting in the bottom of the ice for 18 years .
Two daily nine years of proposition to reproduce the nine months of management that they spend in the user of the mother , they 're now metaphically in the Grank .
For all this time , they 're acculting to the values of their society , values that prefer their prayers , and only their prayer , they 're going to be the cosmic equilibrio -- or to say the ecological balance .
At the term of this incredible initiation , they 're improvised out and for the first time in their 18 years , in the age of 18 years , they see an alba . And in that active , in the wild , when the sun the sun is the valles of the beautiful , all that they learned in theory . The first one of the splendor removed in theory . And the prete a step back , and it 's going back and say ,
" I said , " I 'm going to tell you .
It 's amazing . Now it 's about you protect it . "
They call the major brothers and say that we , the minors , we are the minords of the destruction of the world .
This is extremely important .
When we think of Ingene and the environment of invote Rousseau and the old story of wild , which is a razy concept in his simplicity , which is a razoreau and we say that these people are closest to the Earth of us .
The Ingenes are not feeling or feeling , or indebolites .
There is no space for these things in the Asmsmaller of the Asmat the winds of Tibet , but thank you and the ran , and they created a mystics of the Earth 's nearly not on the concept of the Earth can live only only because it 's not about the neighbors .
What does it mean ?
And that means that a little bit of Ande who grow up the mountain is a spirit of Apu that will leave her destiny , it will be a different human being deeply different human being a different human being deeply different relationship with the mountain that growing a mountain of the Montana who grow up a mass of rock proning a mass of rock pronto be scavated .
which is the dimora of a spirit or a mineral cutting is irrelevant .
What 's interesting is the metaphor that defines the relationship between the individual and the natural world .
I grew up in the forests of Columbia , and the forests that provivivivision to be cut .
And that made me a human being different from my friends Kwakiutl that believe that the Hukuk 's dise and the bow of Hukuk and the bats of the paradise and the blind of the world , spirits that they live in the Hamatsa .
If you start to look at that these cultures can create different reality , you could start to understand some of them sensational discoveries . We take this plants .
I 've taken this picture to open up in the nordocction .
Mayahuasking some of you heard about ayayathrowing , the most powerful psycotive substance of the the sciamanic repertoire .
What makes it fascinating the ayahuash is not the farmacological potential of the substance of the substance of the substance , but his election . It 's made by two elements .
On one side , this lian legnose that makes a series of beta-carboline , harmful and harmful , slightly well-up .
Take the only plants , you have a blums that altery a little bit that you altery , but it 's measured with leaves of a coffee family , he said Psychotridis called Psychotridis .
This plant is a fairly powerful triptamine , very similar to the serotonin , dimethoxptamine-5 , methoxpamine-5 , methoxtine .
If you 'll never see Yanomami , pulling on the bird of the substance that they do by a different species , anchologist , you will have methoxtiny methoxtine .
And I can see that poor on the nose is a little bit like to be disappeared by a card of painbareyes and land on a sea of electricity . [ Risate not creates a distorsion of the reality .
I was often with my professor , Richard Evan Shultes , the man who did the was schedelical , with his discovering the load of the load , with his discovering of the hallucinogenes in Mexico .
I think my road can 't classificate these triptamine as you can 't tell anybody to be allowed . Because if you 're not able to tell nobody to be allowed .
It 's possible to be sounds with other chemicals that denial qualities that denize the MAO .
Now it 's the beautiful : Is the carboline injobs that are in this liana are injeckers of MAO , the same kind of potential to potential triptamine . The question is the sorts of spontaneous , how these people have two dealogically not , but that if you combined in this way , create a biochemical version that is sounds like these , they create a biochemical version that 's danging .
We use the great eupherror of proof of the proof and mistake , which can reveal infrumption .
But if you ask the Indian , they 'll tell us , " The plants are talking to us . "
What does it mean ?
This tribes , the Cofan , has 17 variety of ayahuasks , which are neply in the forest , and that our eyes would remain the forest , and that our eyes would be in the species .
If you ask them how to stabilize their tassonomy . They will tell us , " I realize it 's plants , and you don 't know everything ? " I said , " No . "
The solution is : take the 17 variety of variety in a night , and each one will give each other , and each one will downtowards a different tone .
So , this is not in Harvard , but it 's much more interesting than contest that constructs stami .
Now , [ applaushes the problem is that even the people of our heart people are in their wild , they 're going to be paintorescles , but somehow reducts in the world , and pass .
In fact , the XX century , in 300 years , it 's not going to remind for his drives or innovations , but rather as the thing that we were in and active actively , or accepted , or accepted step of the world 's biology and cultural mass of diversity and cultural mass of biological diversity and cultural of the planet . Now the problem is not the change .
All cultures through the centuries have been involved in a dance for new life .
And the problem is not technology .
The Indian Sioux have no stopped to be Sioux when they put from the arc and they received as the American people don 't have stopped from the horse and calving .
It 's not the change or technology that threatening the integrity of the etnosphere . It 's the power .
The last flight flight .
And if you give a look at the world , you 'll find that these are not destinated cultures destinated .
They 're living creatures and spinspiring out from the existence to identificables that go beyond their adaptation .
I know , I 'm a pathries in the Penan --
a popular nomad , in the west Sarest , in the asian south-libero , and now reduced to a generation , and now reduced to the servite and prostitution on the sought of the rivers , where the river is that it seems to be able to be able to Mar Cinese , where the Mar Is the Mar Meridional Merian , where the gianese Mar 's gianant the horizonte , where the sitting ,
You 're going to fall into the forest woooowned .
Or , in the Yanomami , are the disease that they got with the discovery of the gold .
If we move on on the mountains of Tibet , where I 'm doing a lot of research , you 'll see the hard hard hard .
As you will know the genocide , the physics of a popular , is convicted to the level level , but the etnocide , the destruction of life of a popular life , not only is convicted , but advvanced by advvanced in certain environments , because it 's part of development .
And you can 't understand the suffering of Tibet until you 're the beginning .
I loved the 6,000 miles from Chengu in Chengu Chengu , through Tibet sudoriental , coming in Lhasa with a young connection , but only coming in Lhasa young connection , I realized what we have been talking to .
6,000 sacres in the dust and cenry .
1.2 million people killed by military in the Cultural Rivolution .
The father of this guy was ascriteria in Panchen Lama .
which means that it was killed in the Chinese invasion .
I 'm worse with Santity in Santity in Santity , in the diaspora that has brought the people in Nepal .
His mother was imprigioned and his colpe was to be rich .
It was brought to the age of two years of hidden by the age of two years of bird below his gonna , because he could not have any of him .
The sister , which did the same , it was mit in reeducational reeducation .
A day he inavailed calculating a Mao and , for this transgression , was mit to seven years old .
The Tibet 's pain can be inoverlaugh , but the recenter of the people 's people .
And then , all of the end , all you reduce to a choice .
We want to live in the world in the monoonia or we want to accover the policy , the poliction of diversity ?
The great anthropologist Margaret Mead , before he said that his greatest fear was that , in our way to this frightening view of love , we won 't only see the whole range of human imagination to a very limitate about the human human imagination , but one day we 're going to see that there were other chance .
And it 's umillion years of our species is exist for 60,000 years .
The Neolitics , who gave us the agriculture , which has made us underfighting the seed of the seed , replacing the poem of the smoke , creating the little bit of the smoke , and we talk about 10,000 years ago .
The industrialized world has been 300 years .
That 's the story that you don 't suggests that we have the answers to all the challenge that we have to deal in the millennia to come .
When to these myries of cultures of the world is asked what it means to be human , they say , they say , they say , they 're going to be human , they say , what humans .
And it 's in these answers that we all all risk the possibilities of being what we are , a kind of conscious species , that 's got to make all the people and the gardens can fighting . And there are great moments of optimism .
I went to the northwrote this picture of the northwin Baffin , when I went to the whales with the Inuit , and this man , Olaya , Oaya , and Olaya , he told me the wonderful story of his grandfather .
The canadese government is not always gentle with the Inuit , and in the ' 50s to stabilifestablies , we have to give them them them up in colonies .
The grandfather of this man refused to go .
The family , I teming her life , I 'll take it all the me , and all of his acts .
You have to know that Inuit doesn 't temon the cold , they disdisappear .
The pattins of slitters in origin were made of pain the skin of pain .
The grandfather of this man didn 't intimight from the night or from the librarian that suffering .
It 's sleeping , it 's calculated the pantalone in the skin of foca and defecated in your hand . When I did it , I did it , they work creating a blow .
He sprring on the points of this caccess , and when he became solid , he killed a dog .
He has taken the dog and created a brid , with the cartotototown . He created a slitta , he imbridge another dog and it 's disappeared on the bank , he 's hit on the bunk , he 's caccess to the remain .
Let 's want to talk about cavarself-.
In the aprid of 1999 , the canadese government replacement to the total control of an area of the greatest territory of California and Texas mitted .
It 's their new patria . It 's called Nunavut .
It 's an independent territory . They all about all the resources .
One splendido example of how a natione-state can rerecognize with his people .
And , I think it 's quite obvious at least at the people who are in these remote song of us in these remote song of the planet , to realize that they 're not going to be remote .
For somebody 's home .
They represent several of human imagination that are going to get the dawn . And for us all , the dreams of these children , like the dreams of our children , become part of the geography of hope .
From , we have Geographic , we convinced that politicians will never come to anything .
We believe that the polemies --
[ Applausi is not persuasive , but we believe that stories can change the world , and maybe we 're the best institution to tell stories of the world . Every month of our site . Every month is our site . Every month is to our own 35 million lived .
156 countries transports our television canal canal canal .
Our rivers are letters from millions of people .
Our work is to travel alone to bring our audience in places that are going to be able to bring our audience in a places that they 're going to be absolved by how they saw and , you will , you will , you know , the world 's the existing of the world 's anthropology , and we have to find a life in a pluralyle world , and multicultural world , and multicultural muralist and multicultural world 's life in a pluralone of life in a plurallowly and multicultural world ,
where all the wisdom of all the people can contributing to our eating well-being collective .
Thank you .
I 'm going to talk about some things I wrote in this book that I hope I call more more more more than you 've heard and proverse to evidence , in case , not notice you .
I want to start with what I call " the official dogma official .
The official dogma of what ?
The official dogma of all the Western industrial dogma . The official dogma official , " If we want to massimilar the well-being of our citizens . "
The reason is , from one side , in fact that freedom is in itself a value , is pretious , is pretiful , use , essential for human beings .
The other one of us can act for all the way that if we are free , each of us can act for all all of what massimilar is , without no one that we 're going to be , without no one that we decide in our own .
The way to massimilar the freedom is massimilar to massimilar .
More choices people have , more libed , and the more more more than the freedom , the more of the freedom .
So , this is so deeply radically radically radically , in the society that nobody would dreams to put it in the doubt .
And it 's also deeply rown in our lives .
I 'm going to show you some examples of what progress has made possible .
This is my supermarket . It 's not particularly big .
I lose a simple note about conditions for the insalate .
In my supermarket , there are 175 conditions , without contest 10 variety of the oil oil oil oil , and 12 aceters , and the wheat 12 aceters that you can buy for the cut of the room that nobody of nobody already , that nobody of one of the 175 print , it 's your degrees .
Here 's what the supermarket .
Then you go to the stereo , and you go to buy a stereo : CD lector , radio , radio , the leck .
And in this single store of electronics , there 's a big number of audio components .
We can do six million and a half million different combinations , using the components that there are in only only negospaper .
You have to admit that there is a lot of choice .
Other fields : the world of communications .
Once , when I was a child , you could get all the wish services , to pat the path that they were forborn by mom Bell .
You had the phone , you didn 't buy it .
One of the consequence of that , the phone was that the phone never break .
These days are going .
We have a variety of telephones , especially between the phones .
Here 's the cell phones of the future .
My favorite is that in the middle , MP3 , cut out of the nose , and the blind for the brulelt .
If you don 't have seen it in the near store under the house , you 're handed to come .
And what happens is that people enters in the smoke and the question . And you know what 's the answer is , " No . "
It 's not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn 't do too much .
So , in other aspects of life that are much more important than the acquired of the acquired , the same idea of choice .
Axistence : no more in the United States that you go from the doctor and the doctor you say , " You need to do .
Instead , you go from the doctor , and the doctor says , " OK , we could do A , or B , " You have these benefits and the answers . What do you want to do ? "
You say , " You say , " Doctor , what should I do ? "
And the doctor says , " You have these benefits and these answers , and B has these benefits and risks . "
" What do you want to do ? "
And you say , " Would you like , what would you do ? "
And the doctor , " But I 'm not . "
The result of the result , we call it " almy maluth , expression that makes it look like a beautiful thing .
But it 's actually not that one to move the weight and responsibility to make decisions from somebody who knows something , which is the doctor , to someone else you know , and almost certainly , and it 's not about it , and it 's not in the ideal condition to make the patient .
There 's a huge marketing of products drug products , direct to people like me and you , that if you think it doesn 't make sense , because you can 't buy them , because we can 't buy them .
But if we can 't buy them , because you can 't buy them ?
The answer is that they want that to domorning , we call the doctor to ask them to change the rich .
What 's so fundamental as our identity is our orever orever is a question of choice , like , " We don 't want to force children . You 're going to give the children children . " You 're not going to make the right right right now . " Don 't want to be an identity : we need to invent .
And we can make us us us how many times us do it .
That means that every morning , at the answers , you need to decide that kind of person .
And it was that you can get the family and marriage , a time perspective , almost for anyone , it was that there was the most soon possible , and it was that it was that you were married the most soon possible .
The only real choice was with who , not when , and it 's not when , and even what do after .
Over day , it 's really to play .
I teach students very smart , and I do 20 percent in less than a time .
And it 's not because they 're not just like that they 're not not because they are not unless .
but why are it impensieritors , I mean , I should tell you , or not ? I should do that ? "
" Do I have to think about the children or career ? "
They 're interrogative logorants .
And they look for the answer to these questions , even if this implic untops , and not getting a beautiful vote to my own own .
And they have to do it . I 'm important questions .
Now , the work : we are lucky , like Carl , because technology allows us to work every minute , every corner of the planet , except from every corner of the planet , except from Hotel Randolph .
In parententyourself , there 's a angular , and I won 't tell anybody what WiFi works .
I don 't tell you , because I want to use it .
What does that mean , this incredible freedom of choice that we have to work ? It 's to continue , continue in every moment , if we have to work or not .
We can go to see our son play cell phone , with the cell phone , in a cell phone , Blackberry in the other , and the notebook , typically , and the cell , typically , on the gock .
And even if they 're all spent , every minute that we see our child supply , we 're also asking , " Do you say to this call ? "
" I have to answer this email ? I have to absolutely this letter ? "
And even when the answer is " no , " all this makes the experience of your son , very different than what would be in other conditions .
So , from any of the look at , little , and big materials , and large materials , life is a question of choice .
Once the world was this : Ovreal , there were some chance , but it wasn 't a question of choice .
The world of today is a sidemma is , " Is it , " It 's a positive thing , or negative ? "
The answer is Surprior .
So , positive latest lattempt . I 'm going to talk about the negative .
All this is this compories two effects of the people .
The first , paradox , is that producing a paralysis that producing .
With a lot of options between which I choose , becomes very difficult to do it .
I offer an example : a meaningful study of volunteer pensionally .
A connection of my connection to the Vand data , the gigantic society of pouring pension , with about a million clients in 2000 different companies .
What she found is that for every 10 solutions that are offered in more , the percentage of adesion , the percentage of two percent .
With 50 four-offer-four-percent , there is 10 percent in less adhhand-up adesions . Why ?
Because with 50 fources between which I choose , is maledtly difficult to decide , and choice is to sent the intomorrow .
And to ask tomorrow , and I still wonder , tomorrow , and of course , tomorrow , and of course , tomorrow , and of course , tomorrow , and of course , tomorrow , and I still wonder .
You know , it doesn 't mean that these people will eat food for dogs , because they won 't have enough money , even he wants to say that the decision is so hostics that allow the decision is so host that lose the dator of the work .
They 're not talking about , they 're losing until five dollars for the year from the work , which would be dator to be brought to be .
So , paralysis a consequence of having too many choices .
And I think it makes the world .
" And finally , for ethchup , the ketchup , senape or maion , send or maion ? "
You 'd like to take the right decision , if it 's for the eternity , right ?
You don 't want to choose the wrong wrong , and you 're even the wrong condition .
So this is the first effect . The second is that even if we can avoid paralysis and do a choice , we 're less , we 're going to be done with less options , we were in the end of the result of how we 're going to be with less options between which choose .
And this for different reasons .
One of these is that with many conditions that you wooods , if you buy one and it 's not perfect , it 's easy to imagine that you could do a different choice that would be better . And what happens is that the alternative , you know , you know , the alternative inininspiring of choice , and the recentule of the choice , and the reveness re-up the result of the decision of the result of the result ,
even when it was a good decision .
More choices , there are more you displeased than any details that it 's unlike insophistant of choice .
And also , there is what economists call .
Dan Gilbert has clothly stamacine as the value that we do things depends on what we compare .
The rest , when there are many options , it 's easy to representing the features of alternative artate , and be less sodaunt of the option that you are choice .
Here 's an example . I have a schools .
But that 's what you probably think you would be .
There 's this copy in the Hamptons .
A lussides .
It 's all about splendida . Otly day . It 's all about them .
Not anything . But what he thinks is , " Well , maldying , it 's Agoam . "
" All my neighbors in Manhattan are away . "
" I could talk about it just in front of the home . "
And he 's two weeks of a bright idea that it 's losing -- every day -- the chance of parking where it wants .
The constantly decreases the sodatifation for what we have , even when the choice was excellent .
And the more are the options that we have to look at , more the active characteristics will come up with how expensive opportunity .
Here 's another example .
This is a lot of things .
It 's about the living time , and maybe in the living of the living , and maybe live in the living of the time .
But the most important point is that you choose , you walk 't .
The things that we don 't choose to be active , that they can make less attractive what we do .
Third point : spiral of the expectations .
I tried it on my skin buying a new jeans .
I 'm almost always jeans .
Once the jeans were just kind of , buying them and bestished , and they were besty , only after having a lifesty , only after having a life and work , they were going to be good .
So , I went to buy a couple of a new when the old old people were going , and I said , " I need a couple of jeans , this is my cut . "
The commit said , " Look , you want slim , fit , the axed , relaxed ? "
Do you want to the cernian or " Hed , " Stonebottles ? "
" Look , " Look ? "
" Do you want to leave them to lead ? Bil bla -- " Continured to elenjoy .
I was skeeping , and after a little bit , I could say , " I want the guy to say , " I want the guy that was the only guy . I tried to do all jeans , and then I tried to say , " I 'm going to use the jeans , and I 'm going to use it from the best pair of jeans that I ever had .
It was the massive . With all that I had the best .
But I felt I feel worse .
Why ? I wrote a whole book for understanding it .
The reason I was worse is that with all that I was with all that choice , the jeans had to be perfect .
I started expectations . I didn 't expect anything excited when I was just one guy , but when you live in 100 different , steps , steps , at least one had to be perfect .
What I was buy , but not perfect .
After I had to talk about that I was unlike that I was sationally in confronted to the expectations .
The add of options in life , not doing that they 're expectations that these are respecting to the excellence of options .
And this will be less satifenjoy , even when the result is good .
Nobody in the marketing world , if you realize .
Because if they knew it , you wouldn 't know what I 'm talking about .
The truth looks more at this .
" You know , " You know , " The reason that was the reason that was better when it was worse is that when it was worse is that when it was worse is even possible meet .
Over the world , where we live -- opulent , industry , industrialized citizen -- the massive that we can hope is that things that we can hope is that things are things in the altitude of expectations .
You never surprised as you , because your expectations , my expectations , you 're ungigantic .
The secret of happiness -- what you 're here -- is , " Basasis , " Yes , you want . "
I mean , little car time -- which is really married and my wife is really married and my wife is really amazing .
I couldn 't do better , I couldn 't do it .
But it 's not always account is a bad thing .
And finally , a consequence of buy a couple of jeans when there is only that this jeans is that when you 're not satisssatisfacts , and you ask , " Why ? "
" Who is responsible ? " , the answer is clear .
The world is responsible . What can you do ?
When there are hundreds of kinds of jeans , and you buy one insodatisfacing , and you ask you who is responsible , is the clear , is the clear , it 's the clear one of you .
You could do better .
And with hundreds of variety of variety of variety parts , there are no insuccess .
So when people take decisions , even if the result is the valid , they feel unlike , and they 're sationally insodated and they date the hold them .
In the last few years , the depression is explose in the industry of industrialized world .
I think a meant factor -- not the only one , but important -- of this wave is that it 's just that the people have a dish experiences , because the standard experiences , because the standard are too high .
And when they have to explain this situation think that the colame is they think that the colpe is .
So the final result is that we are better , objectively , but we feel worse .
Let me tell you that .
This is the official dogma , what we all take for good and it 's completely fake . It 's not true .
There 's no doubt that a little bit of choice is better than I don 't have any affact , but from this doesn 't really want to be better than a little bit .
There 's a critical value , I don 't know what it is .
But I 'm sure we 've been overcome from a piece of the level where the choices make our life .
Now , from the politician -- I almost finished -- from the political point of view , the noction is the followest .
What it allows this all of choice in industrial society is the material rich .
There are many places in the world , and you know , you know , where the problem is not that they have any choice .
The problem is that they have too pop .
So the reason I 'm talking about is a males I 'm talking about is a malbeing exclusive to modern society , Western society .
And what it does depress and climbing is this : Steve Levitt talabout how those expensive and discoseats for babs to baby , and the babs are unuseful .
I mean that these choices , complicated and available , it 's not that they 're just inuseful .
I 'm sure I 'm a dollar of the wild .
They 're doing worse .
If a little bit of what in our society is allowed by the result of what our society is reversed in those where people have too poor , it would not only be their life to improve , but also .
This is what economists call a parallian improving .
A redistribution of income redistribution to all -- not only to the poor -- because of this choice in excess that you get .
And so , you can become everything you want to be , you can become everything you want to . "
You , you , you 'll think , " But what does it believe that fish ? "
" It 's obvious that you can 't do anything in a glass . "
" A imagination , a limited vision of the world --
And I 'm going to be a whole thing , I interpret .
But then , I think , instead , I realized that that that the heavily fied the long .
Because the reality of the facts is that if you mand in frantums , so that , " everything you can 't get freedom . You get the paralysis .
If you break the box in a way that everything divent possible diminug .
You can get the paralysis , and you reduced the well-being .
Everybody needs a sphere .
This is almost certainly too close , maybe even even to the fish , and certainly for us .
But the above of some symbot is a recipe for childhood , for the midden .
Thank you very heart .
