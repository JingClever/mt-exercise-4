The year I showed these death demonth that the hot glacial calotta . And that 's glacial expensive , that 's about 48 million years , the U.S. continental .
It 's a submit for the problem is because it doesn 't show the problem because it doesn 't show the ice of ice .
The glacial glacial artical , is in a sense , the heart heart of the global climate system .
You can be inverno invers and the willing .
The next diapositive is going to be a fastonishing the last 25 years .
The ice acus lose are designed in red .
As you see , you see , they 're going to go to the blue .
That 's the ice in invers , which is ritizen .
You can see that the cosidence , five years or five years or five years or more , is like the blood , which is as the body .
In 25 years , it 's past years , and so .
This is a problem because the recently recently around the ocean . And the ocean around the ocean where there are enormous amount of carbon congelated that , they 're transformed in the meters .
I spect to the totalks about the instrument to be able to global warming , that the amount of could be able to pile , that 's not around this point of not .
In some lagey profound in Alaska meters in Alaska is already rebolling from water .
The professor Katey Walter in the University of Alaska team team . I was a team with a team team .
Video : Wow ! I 'm going to be .
And it 's what 's ambic c c surrise to the Nortorth .
This is a glacial record .
The brought it never reached them .
This is the Kangerlussuaq , in the sounds of Groenland .
If you want to know how the sea level of the sea to the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice .
These are going to be able to fast .
The other side of the planet : Antards , the biggest blown of ice the planet .
The last month scientist , they died that the argued of ice is in negative , and the Antarards , which Antarards on some of the sun is , is particularly quickly in the wildness of the sun in the wish scious .
Evval at six feet of the ack-level level .
Sull Himalaya , the third third block of ice , you see new lagey , which was a few years ago were glacious .
40 percent of the population was going to get to the water water ,
Sulle Ande : this glacious glacious water is the source of this city .
The landed was aumented .
But when they diminuids , the same accade to the water pounds .
In California , the neve on Sierra Nevada is diminugal 40 percent .
The idrices are in the crime .
The predictions , like you know , they 're good .
The growth sent in the world leaders to a remarkable remarkable .
The disaster environmental are aumenting to a normal , and without precedented .
Four times more numbers in the last 30 years than I precedented 75 .
This is a wish of all insustainable .
If you look at the historic context , if you can see the consequences .
In the last five years we have add to 70 million tonnels in CO2 million tonnels in the ocean every day .
Look at the country in the ocean , from the American American American , from the American American American parts , and the parts of the substore in the continent , where there is a radical imor of the ocean .
The greater cause of global warming , together to the global warming , which is the 20 percent , is the use of the comfortable to be .
The oil is even worse is even worst .
The United States are one of two countries with the most emissions , together to China .
And they had to build a lot of other cents in carbon .
But we 're going to have a changing changing .
These are the projects in the last years and some property of the last years and property .
And so , there 's a political load in our country .
The carbon on oil and the oil have speso 250 million dollars in the last year to move the carbon , which is a oxy----------------------------------year year year , to move the last year to protech .
That image me to me something --
I 'm Natal Natale in Tennesesession , where I think , there was a loss of 3.8 billion lizes .
Maybe you 've seen on the news .
This is the second second fussign in America .
It 's success around Natital .
The adverse advantage of the carbon was this .
Video : I 'm going to be a lot of the carbon is a kind of allegry and happy .
It 's abundying here in America , and it 's growing our economy .
Frosty the carbon is more milit .
It 's good price , and they 're working on the wish .
Al Gore : The side here is great part of the West Virginia .
The bigger society mineran astest society is Massey Comping . This is his frigher .
Video : Don Blankenship : I 'm going to -- Gore , Nancy Pelous , Harry Remember -- they don 't know what they 're talking about .
Al Gore : So Alleance for the Protext of Clima has two campaight two campes .
This is a bit of them , a part .
Video : ALergy : Alla COALLergy we see the climate change as a sery sery .
So this is investment to make a great amount of money in a lot of money in a lot of money to make the verity of the verity of the carbon .
In fact , the carbon is not sporing .
We think it 's unlike , it 's also -- it 's also a good defuel .
So , not preocummmatic climate change .
Let me do it to us .
Video : Acore : Carbone , you 've heard very much .
So let 's make a lot of the wildness of the wances of the pulit .
Straordinary ! The machines are a little rumor , but that 's the sound of technology .
The consumption of carbon is between the major global warming , but the global global global warming , but the technology of the milit that you see everything .
You look at the wish : This is the odiern technology .
Al Gore : Inend , the positive positive positive the economic question and the economic question and the security .
Video : I 'm in the crime ; the economy , the economy , the climate crime .
The dry connected to all : our dependence from the combuy fossil , as the carbon sporing and oil importantly .
Now , I hope , there is a new , audace solution to use it .
Repower America : 100 percent of energy energy , in 10 years .
A plan to go to the work , and make sure , and help us to stop the global warming .
So , it 's a solution that we brought our problems .
Repower America . Scoprices than .
Al Gore : This is the last .
Video : I 'm going to reach energy to America .
One of the most ways of the most ways to dependence from the comfortable to the dependence that killed our planet .
So , the future is here . It 's the future is here , a new energy .
To get two : Nuoves investment for places of work .
Anyment : Repower . It 's time to be reality .
Al Gore : A old old , you want to go out , " If you want to go to fast .
If you want to go away , you want to go through . "
We have to go away , and it 's very quickly .
Thank you very much .
The year year TED TED To f10 introduction on the LHC .
And promise to get to traveling to the car .
So , I was what the other time , there was no , the other time , there were no , LHC is the biggest experiment ever tented -- 27 kilometers of the conference .
His compuled to reach the conditions that were at less than a million in the universe -- until 600 million than the universe -- until 600 million times in the second .
All of it 's just ambious .
This is the car in Ginevra .
We 've got these min-Big Bang in the Big Bang in the rators .
This is what I work . It 's called ATLAS -- is largely 44 feet and has a 22 meters .
This is a specular picture of ATLATLAS in building so you can see the proportion .
To 10 settember , we 've got acceso the car for the first time .
And this picture was screen by ATLAS .
It was because of immense to control .
It 's a picture of the first inner of the first framework that he had all around the LHC , which is in the HC , which is in the HC , and spread particles inside the reacher .
In other words , when we see that picture the 10 settember , we understand that the car work , that 's a great vitten .
I don 't know if it was to make us more , when someone went on , when someone went on . And he went on .
That means that we have a cultural cultural impact .
I 'm going to give a week later , it was a problem with this machine , I had to have these brought here -- these bought .
These are spend 13,000 price when the car works on the massive massive .
Now , the technical technicians between you look at the fix and say , " It 's not true . I 'm sleep too too much . "
And they can do it because when they are very cosiddling the superconditions .
So , at least 21 degrees , to a temperature to the space between the space between the stars , these are going to bring that the rent .
In one of the gives between the most novehicle in LHC , there was a fect of fect .
So the fix of the flight , and 13,000 to the improve improve to met a resistence .
This was the result .
Now , this is still more than 20 tonto think that these magnetic fish fish are 20 tons , and that are moving about 30 centimeters .
They are about 50 magnetic .
We had to get them , what we did .
We have pristinated and traveled .
Now , they 're going to get all to their place .
I 'm going to be a little bit of mart the LHC is going to be .
We will be going to do , and we expect to get data or the right data , and continue so we continue to find what are the morning that are the morning that are the universe .
Now , of course , in a certain way , these incidents reaccended the debate of the value of science and engineering in front of the engineering of the engineering of the engineer .
I think the fact that 's so hard , the fact of going to go on the limitites , I think that 's the value of things like the LHC .
I want to end with the words of a scientist , Humphrey , which , I think , which , in difense , in difenlies , his own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own , his own own own own mind , he said , " Nist Farm is really dangerous to the human human ideas of the mind of the human mind of the human mind , which is not a lot of the nature , which is not a new new new new new .
Thank you .
I want to start to ask you to ask you when , children , play , play the players .
As you understand how to reach them and make them , and they 're going to move them and move them , learned to think and solve problems .
The reasoning is profoundly connected to the way that we understand the world around us .
So , from the information of the physics of our interaction with objects , with objects , and my consult , and my own collaborator , and my collaborator , and I started to ask , I started to ask , and I started to ask , and when we use a computer , and I 'm a computer , and in a wish wish that is to be a wish saving smart , but it 's a little bit of wish , which is a little bit of wish wish ,
and sistly it up to our please ?
The question was so interesting that we decided to exploring the answer , building Siftable .
In a few words , a Siftable computer interactive as a great gotten .
In a few words , a Siftable computer interactive as a great gotten .
And you can move with the hand , they can see the hand , they can see the way , they feel like the motion and a screen and a radio .
But in fact , they are objects , as the morning , as the morning , you can move to just a race .
The Siftable is an example of a new ecosystem to make the digital information .
And as they become more physical , conscious motion , other , and other , and other , and other hand that becomes more physical , and other than we can explore new new and different things , as we can explore new and different different things .
I 'm going to start with some example .
This Siftable is configured to show the video : if you inclaughting the video . And it 's going to be so , if you smart from the other side side .
These are interactive active .
If you know , in fact , they 're interested in what 's around .
If they 're going to be circle , they can do a bit .
If they 're going to be circle , they can do a bit .
They also have their movement and inlination .
We have to realize that one of the interests of the interaction of the interaction of the data , to example , to example , to example , to example , to example , to example , to example ,
In this case , we have three Siftable configured as the nice and I can use them to the color , where you can use it .
and I can use them to the color in the center , where you mimiles .
And if we 're too , we can get a little bit of place .
I 'm also beautiful possibility to appreciment , as the language , and the mathematics and logames where people can try to be able to see the things that can see quickly , and you can see the results of the immediately .
Now I 'm --
This is a sequence of Fibonaces that I do with a equations .
Here we have a game of words that 's in the words that 's going to half of Scarabeer and Boble .
Pratically , you had a land-re-case on every Siftable , Pratically , to every single single nice on the case of every Siftable , and when I try to get a landscary .
Then , after about 30 seconds , they remissing , and you have a new set of land-to try and new possibility .
Thank you .
So here 's children in the glass , and I did it in the Media Lab , I did it and I 've got a video .
They are like to be very much .
And one of the interesting things of this application is that not to give you people a lot of education .
You 've got to say , " Compmptions of words , and they will exactly what do .
Here 's how they do it .
This is our Mars s , there is the most young , there is the right .
I wanted to just impacting them .
They just just morning , for him .
Now , this is a application of a charge charge .
We had a tool for the appreciation of the language and Lui is Felix .
It can be a new character in the scene , they solved the Siftable .
It can be a new character in the scene , they solved the Siftable .
Here 's a lot of the sun .
Video : The sun is surgender .
David Merrill : Now he took a treatment in the scene .
Video : The treators .
Bel work ! Yeah !
So , in the Siftable and snears can interact the characters --
Video : Bau !
-- inventing the story .
Video : Hao !
DM : It 's a story with the end , and it can decide him how you svolge .
DM : It 's a story with the end , and it can decide him how you svolge .
Very : Very , gat .
DM : The last example I 'm going to show you a little bit of a instrument , to spioning and exeguing music .
It 's a tool , I 've got to sample and to expect music .
The Siftable here are aging from the bottom , and the bacteria .
Each one of these have four different variations , and you can use what .
You can also inserve these sound in a sequence from the light-source constantly .
And it 's just doing it just to make a sell . " And a sequence . "
These are actually control from the vision , like the riverbs and the filtrum .
The acks to a particular sunded and then inced inclands to traveling .
And then there are the general , and they wanted to do , which is applicate to the whole sequence .
Let 's look like this works .
Video : We 'll start with a bottom in two Siftable , and we 're going to be a series , we can add to a series , we add to the other side .
Now I 'm going to put a basis .
Video : Now , I add perception --
Video : And now I 'm going to put the filter and the bacteria , so I can control the same .
Video : DM : Can an intersequence to sequence the sequence of the time from another .
Video : I 'm going to add the filter filled the bottom to the most expression .
Video : DM : Can I 'm going to recombined the sequence .
So I don 't have to planning before , but I can improve , reach to be more , and make it more or more corta .
And now , finally , I can spend the intersequence , in the left Siftable to the left Siftable . "
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is build new interfaces as well as much more than the brain and the other miles like our brain and body .
And today , I 've got time to show you one of the result of this load , and also some possibility that we try to bring out from the lab .
The concept that I want to spend that 's coming to this new generation of objects for interact with the digital media , which will take information in our world in the way that we want .
Thank you very much .
I 'm not going to talk about all of you .
I 'm a writing .
I 'm going to be the books is my profession , but it 's more than this , of course .
It 's also love and the cine of my life .
And I don 't expect that it can change .
But , he said this , something particular happened to my life and my life and my own life and my own own life , which has taken me to recently the interest with this work .
The particular thing is that I 'm written this book , this biography called " " Mang , " What , I was , " What , I was was a great feeling , and it 's going to be a great feelational , and it 's going to be a great feelational , bestler .
And the result is that everywhere else else , people are treatment like they were .
So , he was concerned .
They have to me now all of me , and they say , " You don 't have a lot of not to make better ?
You don 't have a fear to write to writing for the most to create a book that can make someone ? "
What can you know someone ? "
It 's unsure , you know .
But it could go worst , as I remember what I remember I 'm going to say , when I started to say , " I was a writing -- I wanted to be a writer .
I was in the same reaction on the same reaction .
And people said , " Do I don 't say to have success ?
You don 't have a million pair of the refed refed ?
You have no fear to do this mestius for all of life , nothing to come out and dead on a coach of the dream of the board with the board of the failure ? "
So , you know .
The answer -- the bridge answer all these questions is , " Yes . "
I 'm like all those things .
I 've always been fear .
And I also have a lot of other things that people can 't inate .
As the alth and other spent things .
But , as it 's about writing what I thought and I would say , and I would say , "
Is it ?
It 's logical that everyone is spent to be spent to be spent from a job that you know ,
But what is that in the enjoined in the other people who are the mental health mental health mental forth in a way that other other carries in a way that other carries don 't do ?
How my father , for example , he was a engineer and not remember a chemical engineer in his 40 years of activity in his 40 years of activity in which they asked him to be engineer ?
There was never -- that blown us to the engineer John , how do it ?
It didn 't work like that , right ?
Onestly , engineers like a group of not certainly , in the seargued , the reputation of the reputation of being alcolized .
We have a scritters , we have enough to reputation , and not only a creative reputation of the very , we have this reputation of be enormous instainable .
And it 's not to look at the tric of the dead of the dead of the dead , they create a young young , dead young and often to their own own .
And the ones that are not suicians seem to be recially disappeared by their damong .
In the Mailer , before he dive , in the last interview said , " Oach my book , he killed a little bit more of a little bit about the work of their own life .
But we don 't bate to say , because we 've heard these things that we 've heard these things that we 've been completely interized and accepted the notion that creativity and the income of the notion that art , they 're going to be a few leged and that art , will be always to the ange .
And the question I want to take all today is : are you about today is : you 're doing this idea ?
I 'm going to tell you , because you look at a centimeter centimeter of me not good for this supposed .
I think it 's odious .
And I think it 's dangerous and I don 't want to see the perpetured in the next century .
I think it 's better to be incouraged to live .
And I 'm sure that , in my case -- in my case -- it would be very danging to start to the saving that I 'm in my own own own .
Of course -- I 'm looking at , I 'm pretty young , I have about 40 years .
I 've got about four decades of work in me .
And it 's very likely that anything I 'm going to be right now to the job of my last book .
I 'm going to go back , because we are all more or less friends here -- it 's likely that my own own own own .
Oh , Gesus , which thought !
You know that 's the kind of thinking that leaders a person to start to bate in the morning and I don 't want to do it .
I would continue to continue to do this work that .
So , the question is it , how ?
And so it seems , after a lot of reflessions , which the way to work to go to writing is to create a psychologic costruct , right ?
I wanted to find a distant distance of security between me , which I 'm writing , and my natural anxion what I writing is going to get to get out and , while I was trying to get the time to see what I started looking at the time , trying to find other society to find out of the best things and the best things and make the best things and more sane and more than the best and the most of the best and the other things that I 'm going to see if they could have ideas and the best ,
how to help people create their own own own inerasing people to create creativity .
And that research has taken me to the Great and the Great and the Rome .
I 'm going to go back .
Nanange and the Great and Rome -- people don 't seem to believe that creativity was ince to men , OK ?
And it was thinking that creativity was this spirit , and they came to men from men from men from a few surprise and unknown .
The green would call these demand the spirites of creativity .
You look , wonderful , he was creating to have a demon that elargy from the wisdom .
The same idea , but they call that the same kind of spirit , but they were not not a genium .
The great , because the Roands was not really really a genium was someone who was a smart of a smart .
And they have a genium was this species of entity divine that they were living in the murs of a artist , a little bit like the elfo Dobby , and that they would indeed out of the artist work of the artist work and the result of the artist , and the result to the result of the arts of the argue .
Exxial -- that 's the distance of what I talked about -- that costruction psychologic you protects from your work .
And they knew that was so that worked , right ?
So , the artists were protected by certain things , like for example , as for example , as for example , no ?
If your work was exciting work , you couldn 't take the merized , all of the desert , all of the time they had to help us to this genium .
If your faililed job , it was not all of your failils , right ?
Everybody knew that it was your genium to be a inhate .
And so people han conceive creativity in Occcycle for very time .
And then the Rinases came to the deed , and the whole idea ; we 're going to be the human being in the center of the universe on the center of the universe on the ground of the creatures that writing from divinity .
This was the principle of humans and people started thinking about creativity and people started thinking about creativity is completely from the ilights .
And for the first time in history , you start to referred this or the artist , as a very , as to a genium than a person with a genium .
And I have to say , I think that was a big mistake .
I think that allow someone , a simple person to create a recipient as a recipient as the source , the surgency and the surprise , creativins , ints and inknowable and etheriial is a responsibility to the framework .
It 's like to ask someone to ingoiate the sun .
We form and destaining and destaining all these ingestible expected on the performance .
And I think it was this pression to have been in 500 years .
And if this is true , and I think that 's , the question is becomes , and now ?
Can we can do that .
Magary to get to a more antage of the relationship between humans and mistics .
Or maybe no .
Maybe we can 't have to 500 years of thinking about a 18 minutes .
And there 's probably people between the public public that they would be legited in scientific notion , indeed , or the notion of the other things that they followed the next projects .
I 'm not going to do all about this thing .
But the question I would like to take is -- why no ?
Why don 't I think about this way ?
Because it 's more sense of every other thing that never heard to explain the impreveals .
And that 's a process that , as anybody who ever been done to do something -- so , basically , all here -- you know , you don 't know .
And , in fact , it can look at all of them ,
I did this inspired with the extraordinary , which has 90 years , but he has 90 years , but he has 90 years , but he was a poeted for all of life and said that during her infected in the rural Virginia , and feel that was working out of the wind , and he was a few years , when a points was the wth of the wind .
I said that it was like a fragorous .
And he was coming out of her from her paesthy .
It 's going to feel , because he had to be able to be the land under his feet .
He knew that was to have one thing to do that point and he was , " goes to him , " to how a math . "
And so he would be able to the house and it was going to be followed by this poesia , and it would make a piece of card and a little enough enough enough to the page and the page .
And I couldn 't be enough to be enough to be enough to be enough and correct and correct , and he would get up to the house and she had to come and she would continue to the back and she would continue to the patholar through the pathor , and she would have been to sleave the other poet . "
And then there were those times -- this piece of the time I 'm going to never -- there were almost losing , and it was almost losing , OK ?
So , he was going to go home and she was trying to the card and the poesia went through , and he was a match , and he said that it was like , and he said that it was like the other hand and the willing .
And he was the poesia from the coda and he would take her body and the page .
And in these cases , the poesia would be presented on the perfect and intact but the last word at the last word .
So when I feel thinking about -- it 's paper , it 's exactly the same , it 's exactly the whole process .
Not all my creative process -- I 'm not a cycle .
I 'm a mud , and my way to work is ; I see it 's sought to the same time and working on the same time and I 'm going to be there .
But even I 'm going to my testing , I 've been strized against that , at times .
And I think that even many of you have the han did .
You know , even though the work and ideas came to me from a certain source , you can 't be source .
And what is this ?
And how can we relate it to us to get up to the head , but , rather , rather , which , you make us us ?
For me as much as I 'm the best example , I have the musicist Tom Waits , which I interviews that I interviews a few years ago for a day .
We were talking about this , and you know , Tom , and the most of life was the incharge of life is the incharge of the artist , to start to control , to start , domining these species of impults .
But then I 'm going to do , and I was a day , and he was a day , and he was driving on a Los Angeles , changed everything for him .
He was going to go through the wind of a tract . This little framement of melodia , which comes in his head as it makes the inspiration , and the inspired , and the desider , and the desider , and the desider , but it 's wonderful , and the desidth , it 's wonderful , and the desider .
It 's not a piece of card , it has no one matters .
So I began to feel this species of old old anxist in him , " I 'm going to lose , and I 'm going to lose , and I 'm going to be .
I 'm not good enough , I can 't do it . "
And instead of go to the panic , you stay .
I 'm going to mit the whole process and did something completely new .
I 'm just the sky and said , " Scell , I 'm not seeing that I 'm driving ? "
" Do you look that 's going to write a song ?
If you really want to exist , in a more opposition when I can take me me to you .
I 'm going to be able to be qualclumn quality .
I went to disturbing Leonard Cohen . "
And his process changes . And he changed after this .
It doesn 't work , the work was still still .
But the process , and the fish that was that attack was removed when he was releave when he was a press and the genium , the genium that was going to get out of where it was , but they were going to be a thing , they had to be a thing , and it was going to be a thing , and it was going to be a thing and saving .
but the well----collection , wonderful bizarra collaboration between Tom and this thing , and this strange thing that he was not Tom .
So how I was feel that story about changing a bit about how I was working , and I was already save me .
This idea , I save me when I was writing " Mangs , Pra , and I said , " and I know , and I 'm working on something and the disperation that we 've been working on something and we don 't start thinking about something and I think that will be the worst st , which is going to be the worst st st st st st st .
Not only good , just the worst book writing .
And I started thinking about geck this project .
But then I remember I talked about Tom that I talked about the air and try to .
So I went to my face on the manures of the writing and deressed my common on on the room .
And I said to the vote , " Sents , what 's going to be brilliant not going to be very , not going to be a very , not going to be a little bit about it , no , no , no way ?
Because as I see it , I 'm going to see what I 'm , I don 't have this .
So if you want to be better , you have to presenting and do your part .
Okay . But if you don 't do it , you know what , I don 't do it .
I 'm going to writing the same because it 's my job .
And I 'd like to talk about the North that I presented me to do my part of the North Africa of the North Africa of the North Africa of the Northern Africa of the North people who were rounded for the dances and music , and the music , and music , and the music , and the music , and the music .
And they were always magnify , because the ballerins were great .
But every so , rarely , something happened , and one of these artists had become really transcendous .
And I know what you know about , because I know that you 've seen , to a certain point , a performance so .
It was like the time , you stay , and the ballerwalk through a little bit of a little bit of the soldier , and it was all the time , and the 1,000 night before , but all the time .
And at the improve not to be a human .
But it 's accese from the divinity of divinity .
And when this next time , the people knew what was , they were , they were , he would call him him him .
They were the hands and they were to doctare , " Allah , Allah , Allah , God , God , God , God , God , " God , God , "
That 's God , you know .
And I was a historic named -- when the Morinvent More invent , I was this absolutely .
In Spaign , when a artist did something impossible and magic , " Allah , and I , Allah , and I 'm a very good thing , and I was a land-like God .
And it 's great because we need .
But , the problem comes the day , and the ballerself , when you smoke up and the discover that are the 11 of Martedday , and the last birth of God , there 's no longer .
It 's just a mortal mortal with giny -- and maybe we never have more to make it more to make that altel .
And maybe nobody will the name of God still , and what has to do with the rest of his life ?
It 's hard .
This is one of the most paining recognize to make a life .
But maybe it 's not to be so anthy if you can 't believe , and that the most extraordinary , which is the most extraordinary of your being from you .
But you know , you know , you 're just like to be a kind of inimaginable to the point of your life that you have to go to someone else else when you finished .
And , you know , if we think about it changes .
And so I started thinking about the book , and it 's sure as I thought for different months during the book that I 'm going to be able to be able , and willing , and expected , and followed followed , and I 've been followed to my own success .
And what I have to continue when I feel I feel that I 'm not going to have a feeling .
I 'm not just about your work .
Continua presenting of your part , any can be .
If your work is balling , balls .
If the divine , asking , and I decided to leave you to leave a few kinds of wonderful wonderful , for a few kinds of wonderful wonderful , to a moment through the tussor , then , " Ole ! "
I tried , you know , you know , your dance .
And " Ole ! " You know , you know ,
I think I think , and I think I 'm going to teach it .
" You know , it 's just to have the same , even to have love human tical targues to make a few of the tal tremendous .
Thank you .
Thank you .
June Cohen : Ole !
As you know , I 've been talking about some of these projects on the genome of the genome of new new new parts .
Now we 're beginning to digital , we started to digital biology and now , and now we 're going to start to the digital biology , we 're going to build and biology and intetize it .
We 've always tried to take the great questions .
" What is the life ? " That 's something that many biologists are tented to understand vary to the livels .
We 've got different appreciate , we 've got to the minimum .
We 're digitalien by almost 20 years .
When we sequenced the genome of the human genome in the world .
Now , we can we make the life , or create new life , or create new life from this digital universe ?
This is the map of a small organism , Mycoplasma genitalium , which is the species from the genome , which is the species of the authorium .
And we 've got to reduce the genome to create a little bit more small .
We are able to eliminate a centina-genes of about 500 .
But when we look at his map , it 's relatively simple than our .
I think , this is simple .
But when we look at all the genes that we can get , one to the time , it 's very unlikely that this can bring a living cells .
So we decided to property this is to be intended to greattempt to be intended this chmosoma in a way to get the components to some of these fundamental questions .
And so we started the avventure of " Can we can be a sweweathy ? "
Can you can make these big molecules that we never have to make these big molecules that we never did it to create before ?
And in case , we can make a cheamosoma ?
A chmosoma is just a piece of material al chemical material .
The speed that we are able to digital life is growing to us to grow life is growing to us .
Our ability to write the genetic code , instead , instead , but it 's better , but it 's better , but it 's better .
And our most recent results the fly result .
We 've been started 15 years ago .
The process has revision , starting with a bioetic revision before we began to the first experiment .
But we found that synthize the DNA is very hard .
There are a decines in thousands of machines in the world that produces , in the long DNA , of the long time , 30 to 50 lecting and it is a process : the most mistakes there are .
So we had to develop a new method to assembling these framments and correcrecrect the mistake .
And that was our first tentertainment , in the digital genome of the genome of the genome of the genome of the genome of the genome of the genome of the genome of the genome of the genome of the genome of the genome of the genome of the genome of
It 's a little virus that kills .
We 've designed the frammers , but the correction of the mistaining and get a molecule of about 5,000 lectable .
The interesting part is when we 've got this piece of material , and we 've got it in bacteria , and we 've got to read this genetic code and propering this code and property .
The viral particles are then left by the cells , they 're back and they come back and they distroroyles .
I talked about the recent industry of the oil industry , saying that their own own own own .
They have more than you .
We think that this is a situation where the software is really to build his hardware in a biologist .
But we wanted to do things in the bigger .
We had to build the entire chmosoma .
I 'm going to be 580 mile .
So we thought about building the size of the size of the virus virus , so we can change the cassets , so we can change the components of a living cells .
The designing is crucial , and if we start with digital computers in a computer , these have to be very accurate .
When we sequenced this genome for the first time in 1995 , in 1995 , it was a mile for 10 mile mile .
We found , we found , 30 mistake . If we had to use that sequence never be able to do that .
One part of the process is designing , 50 land-land-wraphic .
We 've got the unds here .
You can be the mind you have to be the philic .
Think about this : We have a genetic code on four lectary , C , C , Os and T.
And you know , you know , they were going to get about 20 friend , and there 's a specific order to spend to the lectable to the hot of the land-willland-willling .
So we can use the genetic code to write words , which is thinking .
What we did in the beginning is autographed .
Some of the fact that it was not a few exia .
We 've designed these segments to be just unting with me .
There are the essentions that repay them and they put them .
And we started assembled to assembled with the parts , and five to seven miles , unended to be able to make segment of 24 miles in the unending people to get 72 miles to get to 72 miles .
So , we 've got these segments in above so so that we 're going to be able to create a very unlike to create a very very unlike you see in a minute .
We 're trying to automatize the process .
So , this seems like the tabove of a board ,
When we get these segment very long , the most 100 miles , they will not grow up up the Eccles .
It 's going to get the limits of modern biology .
So we 've been considered other mectums .
We knew about another mecchanism called recombination omologa , which in biology is ulized and to get DNA DNA in order to refly DNA in order .
Here 's a example .
This organism , called the Deinococracy , can assorry three million rad .
You can see in the wear as his chmosoma is is destroromosoma .
In 12 -- 24 hours is remarkable to be like was before .
There are thousands of organisms that are able to do it .
These organisms can be able to be completely .
They can live in the vuum .
I 'm absolutely that life exist in space , and you know , to find new environments of water .
And the real , NASA showed that this is .
This is a picture of molecule that we 've built with these processes , just using the liquid design appropriate design appropriate .
The authomatically .
This picture was not been scacked with a microscope , but with a microscope , but with a microscope .
It 's a very big molecule that we can see the microscope with a launch .
These are picture that they 're doing a time of about six seconds .
This is the advers that we 've done .
I 'm going to be 580,000 land-----------80,000 .
It 's the bigger of a definition of a definition .
It has a lot of the danger to 300 million .
If you 're going to stamp up with a 10 without spaces , they would like 142 page to get this code .
Now , how do we do it work ?
Of course , tramite a virus is a game game from kids .
It 's a bit more complicated when you use of bacteria .
And it 's more simple when it 's cells as our cell , as our : you can just extract the nucleo and inserves another , which is basically the process of cloning .
In bacteria ia , the bacteria is integrated inside the cells , but we 've recently demonkey that we are able to make a trailer of a chmosoma from a cell cell .
We 've got a cromosoma by a species .
The two different as men from the topes .
We have to add some gene to decide what they can decide what you can do this chmosoma .
The other other hand , and the essentions in the protech .
And when we put it in the cells was study -- and you can appreciate our gravy sophisticato-- the new cycle is going to go into the cells .
And we were thinking that we couldn 't go on on the other , but we tried to spinging us over there .
This is one of the major mecy-evolution .
We found that that many species have added a second or a third chmosoma , and a few other other other other people in a second thousands of new tracks to that species .
So who think about evolution as a only gene gene to the time that you have no grant part of biology .
They 're going to be called me restrial restriition to the whole DNA .
The cymosoma that was in the cells doesn 't have a lot .
The phone phone hour the cell phone that we have inserito----------------------------------------------------------cell cell cell cell .
It 's expressed , and he recognized the other chromosoma as material , has been recognized , and we 've got to only the cells and the new cells and the new cells .
It 's become blue because of the genes that we 've been serious .
And in a short leep leep , all the characteristics of a species are going to lose the whole new species , the new new species , based on the new software that we 've been in the cells .
All the proteces are changed , the membrane are changed , and when we read the genetic code is exactly what we spend up .
Now , this might seem to look at the genetic software , but altering the DNA DNA we can change the things in a place .
Now , I 've already explain that here is not about geny -- but progress to the three million years and a half million years and a half years and a half years and a half years and a new version of the explosion of the whole process .
Why do we do that ?
I think it 's enough to think that we think about our necessarily .
We 're going to spend up and a half billion people in the next 40 years .
Right to give an example : I went to 1946 .
Now there are three people on the planet for each none existant in 1946 years , there will be four .
We 're going to find food , water , and the water and the nine and the nites and the wills and the wills and a half billion people .
It 's still going to be more than to do that for note billion .
We 're going to be more than five billion carbon , more than 30 billion baries .
That means a million baries in the day .
When we try to find the biological processes , or any kind of process to reach them , it will be a very very very very very very very very challenge .
We have to keep the most of CO2 from these materials that finids in the atmosphere .
Now , in today , thank you scientific discovered in all the world , we have a lot of about 20 million genes , and I like to think that the future .
The electronical industry is only a dozen of the components , and think about how many different things are coming out .
Our limitites here are the most biologists and our imagination .
Now we have the techninic , because of these metods of intetization , in fact , in fact , we call genomics .
We can build a big robot that can build a big robot that can produce a million on the day .
Think of processing these 20 million genes or to try to make good for the processes to make the other other people to make it or drugs , new vaccines , we can change , thank you to a little team , and create more biology , and create more biology , in the last 20 years of science .
And it 's just a selection .
We can get to the possibility of survival , production or chemical , production , production of vaccines .
This is an antanthy instantantanea 's what we 're working to be able to be able to be able to be able to make species species .
Well , we don 't know how to be .
We know exactly the genetic code .
Now we 're going to focus on the fourth of the quarters .
You know , you know that extreme from the grass was a finite experiment .
We have carburts of second second , and third generation that they 're going to be enough to the swealth of the most value as the either of different kinds of butany .
But the only way that the biology is to have a great impact of food , and the concerned food and limitititable to transforming the food and limititable to transforming the cell that we 're working to design the cells that we 're working with the way , and we think that the first carbon .
The light light light light light light is a metodo-- but in our discovered in our discovered , we found different metodo-- we found different metods .
This is a critical organism that we 've described in 1996 .
They have deep , at about 2500 meters of the water .
They create a metan CO2 using idrogene molecular as the source of energy .
We 're trying to understand if we can see the CO2 , which can be transformed to be transformed to be transformed to be transformed to the the CO2 in carburant , to make this process .
So , we short think we could be able to increase what is the question of the question of the question of " which is the life , we know -- we have the modly , we have the modest internal interest to the entire oil .
Exxize . If you can 't do it from TED , where you can ?
It would be a main in the energy .
And we 're working for the same metods to create vaccines .
You 've seen this year with the influence , we 're always going to get a dollar in less when it 's to find the waccine .
I think what you can change build vaccines in the ancient ent .
So , as the future might start looking at at the future , the trees , which is evolution , accellerating evolution with bacteria , which is infinally cells .
We are so much from the best people .
Our discover is to make a long way of live enough to do to do . Thank you very much .
First of all of you will do , the most quickly possible , some fundamental work that we 've taken to the Microsoft in follow a little bit about a year ago . This is Seadragon .
It 's a environment where you can interact is to the local level that remote with a huge amount of data .
So here we 're looking at a lot of digital picture of digital phoom with a kind of zoom and continuous , for a faster , and a vehicking , aving images like we want .
And it doesn 't matter how big information is the amount of information that we see how big data , or the images .
Most of the digital photographs , but this for example is a provide from the Bioteca profound from the Bioteca , and recenter in 300 megathering .
It 's not a difference because the only thing that limit that limit of a system like this is the number of pixel on your screen on your screen in any time . It 's a very flikely flection .
This is a book , by data , by data not images .
This is Casa desolated Dickens . Every colony .
So , I 'm going to show you that 's just about the text , we can do something like that , to see that is a real real real representation of the tremendous .
It could be a bit a little artificial to read a little electronical book .
Don 't get the son .
This is a more realistic example . It 's a number of the U.S. L.
Every picture is the beginning of a seition .
And you really know , and the beautiful experience of reading the truth . And you know the version sion of a fairline of a quotic .
We also did something with the angle of this number in the Look .
We 've created a mad advers . We 've got a lot more than that you use in a normal piece of the product -- and we 've got a lot of the content .
If you want to see the character of this automobile , you can see here .
Or other models , or even the specific specific technique .
And that really shows some of these ideas to eliminate the limits of space .
We hope that this is going to put up up and other porcheries , and other porcheries , not to be necessarily necessarily .
Of course , the map is one of the most obvious applications .
And on this doesn 't want to lose time , if we don 't say that we have contribute to the field .
These are the strade in the U.S. S. subvrapped in NASA .
So now we 're going to go what else .
This is effectively from the vial web ; you can see .
It 's a project called Photosynnth , which combine two different technologies .
One of course is Seadragon and the other is a very interesting visual computer .
And it 's from the wish , I 'm going to get from Seadragon .
You can see when we do that when we do this kind of screen , where we can go from a picture to another and have this kind of experience to solution .
But the location of images here here has actually a meaning .
The algorithms of visualization of the computer have recorded these images together , in the way that corresponds to the places that the argue , and the walk of the Montagagne Rococks -- you 're going to be the walk of a few imagining of a imagining of a imagining of a imagining ining initial imagining of the imagining of a imagining ining ining ints .
I don 't know if I 'm going to show you some other environment .
I 'm a lot more more space .
I want to spend up the original data of Noah-- and this is prototypes of Phototypes that we 've done to the first time we 've done the first time , to show you what I think about the first time is really the key key key to show you what I think is really the key key key key to be really really really really observing the key key key thing that we 've been able to be the website .
We had to prepay us to expect us of the legal and forth .
This is a rebuild the tedral of Noth Notots Dame . Badigital . Bap digitites Nots in Flickr and you get pictures of the camp of the camps of the neighborhood and saying . Oach one of these coni coni coni is discovery , to be indeed to this model .
So I 'm all images and I 've been connected to this way .
And it 's possible possible to be a very simple way .
You know , I would never thought about how to finish to work for Microsoft .
It 's very gratifiction to get this kind of accoiling here .
I think you see that it 's about a lot of different focus on focus : from those of the phones of the phones of the SLR , a meananing , and in this environment .
And if you can , I try to try to look at those more strange .
So , there are blown up , except .
So , there 's a series of photographs -- and it 's cole .
This is a poster of Noter Dame registrate registrate .
We can move from the posters to the physics of this environment .
The essential point is that we can do with the social environment . This is now take data from the whole memory . This is to take data from the whole side of the Earth , from the visual point of view , from visual view , and connected all those data together .
All those pictures become connected , the bigger of the parts .
You have a model of the earth model that emerging .
Think about this as a prolungment of Stephen Lawler on Earth virtual .
It 's something that grow up in complexity , and the people who are using , and the people who are going to use it to the use of the use .
They are marked up with metaders .
If you have a bit of the idea of contrasment , and he said , my picture of the name of the cattedral .
Of course , a consequence of all of the things are virtual models of every part of the land , which is not going to be able to be able to hore and pictures and pictures and pictures and similar images and similar images .
Millamamage .
Chris Anderson : I understand ? What your software is going to do is that your software to make it is that to make a certain point , in the next years , all the photographs , in the world will be practically connected to the whole thing ?
BAA : Yeah . What 's doing it is doing in fact .
It 's creating the lolink , if you want , you to be , between images .
And it 's doing that in the bottom of images .
The becomes to very interesting if you think about the chemistry of information information that many of these images that many of these images .
As when you do a research research on the web , you have a frase and the web web has a lot of information about the picture .
Now , what happens if that picture is connected to all your picture ?
So the amount of interconnection and the amount of semantic interconnection . It 's really huge . It 's really huge . It 's a classical classical classical .
CA : Blaise , it 's really amazing .
BA: I 'm thank you very much .
One of the most of the most of the most of the most of the research research is the points of the economic research is the potential to live between who are in the anti-trained ining in-trained ining the past , the past , which is the past , the wind , which is the past the pieces , is the wind , is the wind and the piant of the plants .
Basti thinking about the monkeys Jagar , and the other things are still in the U.S. , or that the monitites of the ancient people in Himalaya , or which in Himalaya , the good dought , the good good dought , but to remember the most of the human human human , and the idea that we live in the world , which is not just a sense that we think about the world 's really , but it 's just a model of reality .
The consequence of a particular bunch of choices that our styres our styes has done , well , many generations ago .
And , of course , we share the tracks .
We all have . We 're going to create .
We are subjects to start .
We have to death the inesorability of death , so we don 't surprise if we 're going to slegs and we go --
We have a art art .
What the bits is the particular song , the song , the dance of every culture .
It 's not about the Woman Is the Borneo , or following the Vodoor of Haiti , or the werern Kaissent in Kenya , or the desert of the Kenya , or a sleep in the Cander , or a Sahara .
He was my own own own own journey in the desert of a month ago , or a month ago in the Womer , the department of the world .
All these people are teaching us that there are other ways of exist ways of thinking , other ways of thinking about about move in the world .
And if you reflect a second , it 's a concept that you can give you hope .
And then , the miriaths of cultures of the world creating a spiritual life , and the cultural cultural cultural , which is important for the planet and it 's important for the writual biologic biologic as the biophera .
And you can think about this ragnotion , as a nine of the nine of the nine of all the concep----------in-in-concepts , ideas , intuition , intuition , intuize the human conscious , intured by the human conscious ,
The sphere is the fantastic paththetic .
It 's the symbole of what we are and what we can be as as a species .
And as the biosphera was been very quickly consumed , as it was success to the etnosphere and undly , and unfortunately .
In fact , for example , would say that 50 percent of all the species is about the time , it 's about the expensive expensive , because it 's a lot of the most apocalitted diversity -- in the fact of biologic diversity -- and it 's not nearly nearly in a little bit of the most optimistic , the diversity of the cultural diversity .
Now , the indictioning language .
When you 're bored 6,000 language on this planet .
One language is not only to a wooid wy-well-rules .
One language is the spring of the spirit of human spirit .
It 's the half of the animal animal , it comes in in the world .
Every language is a forest of mind , a backin , a thought , a very very simple .
And those 6,000 language , while we are in the Mterey , at the Mterey , less half the children .
They don 't have more teaching children , which means that , not that it 's not to do something that , which are already death .
What is there 's more tried to be aved by the silence , the last to be the last to talk about a language , of the other people to get the saggeon , or to the other than the kids ?
This was a few days of the world 's been some part of the world every two weeks : every two weeks , and a few weeks , and a door with the tomba language of ancient language .
And I know someone 's not better ?
The world would not be a better place if we 're all the same language ? " Benissim , then we talk about all yoruba . Parlies .
We talk about kogs .
You can see a tract thing about the language .
I would like to do you to do a journey through the etnosphere --
a little journey in the etnosphere to give you a source of what we 're losing .
Many of us deal that when I say , " different ways of exist exist .
We make example example , this bimbo Barasana , in Amazonia , the popular popular , the popular popular , which crede to the mix--sack-sackers .
It 's a popular popular that it 's not in the blue blue from the verde , because the time you get identifed in the forest , from the people .
They have a strange language and a matrimonial dry , he said , " He 's explain , " to tell you a person who talked about a different language .
All of the past mitologist , in the past mitolarity is that in these families are that in these families are in these families , and the mathematrimmons .
They limited listen to listen and then they start talking about .
We make one of the tribes that I lived , the Waorans of Ecuststore , the Waorans of the Ecuststice , a incredible popular that has been in 1958 .
In 1957 five missionary missionary conducted a sustainable conducted .
They did the top photographs that they were going to get them to us that they were friend , dimented that this popular , and the inforest that this population of the forest .
They were going to have the picture from the earth , they were going to play a shape , or a shape , they were going to be that the died of the diavy , and they killed the lance .
But the Waorans don 't have to be only the straight .
They killed to between them .
The mortality was caused to their same .
We 've got two of the generations and we found two cases of morning and when we 've been inspired to know that one of them was invecting that one of them was invecting , and then they killed it , and then they killed him him him .
The cyyators were able to recognize the animal of 40 steps and recognize the species .
In the first years , I was made a really interesting compassium when my professor of Harvard , I asked me to go to Harvard and the frest of the potential of Duvalier and the Tonton Macool of Duvalier and Tonton Macocodies and the Tonton Macodies and the veils .
So , to give a sense of mirate , I would have to understand the culture . Vodoor is not magnine .
It 's quite a complex vision of the world .
So , very interesting .
If I ask you to say the great religions of the world , what you want ?
Cristianesimum , Islam , Buddism , Ebraism , etc .
It 's always left up up , and I think that Africa sub-saharian not to feeling . And they 're not about religious . And the Vodoor is not other that distilild of these religious things are very profound in the source of the slavery .
What makes the interesting voodoor is the inty is the intended between life and death .
So the vision they have hired the spirites .
The spirites can be invoced by Grande Acqua , they say to the dance of the dance and the time to the time to the end of the vision of the vision that that we have been the following the following bees .
So , the voodoor said , " You know , " You know , you go to talk about God .
We say , " We say , " We say , " We say God . "
And the moment that you 're going to be the spirit that you can do you like , how do you can you do you like to be ?
So you have to these events : following voodoor in was a lot of trance that towwns are infuel in a rather forward of the power of mind when it 's catalized in the body has been a very strong of expensive grow in a refly .
And the people who lived the most extraordinary that I lived the most amazing Nevada .
It was a sending of the civilization that once once they were living on the planets of Colombia in in the conquentist of the conquest , the popular popular , the popular of the source that you were reduced on the planning .
In a druchieve health health care , and this popular has never been conisted to the spread .
And yet , there are governments from a dought , but their formation is decide .
The young following following the families , and they live in a few years , and live in a world of good cool and degrees in the bottom of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the beyourself .
Two damage of note note years ago , to reach the note months of the demanage of the mother , now are metaphor , they are metaphor in the Not Mther .
So , that 's time , they 're acculated to the values of their society , values that they preice and only their preice , and only their preice -- or to say the equilibrief -- or to say the equilibriecological .
In term of this incredible began to be lived out and for the first time in their life , at 18 years , you see a age of 18 years , you see a lot of consciousness of the first ball of the values of beautiful beautiful . And the values of beautiful beautiful paesthetime , all that they have learned in his spend . The worth of the foundly , and it 's going to go back to the talk about the first time . And they 're going to go back to the same same , and they 're going to be a talk about the talk about the first time , and he said to the first time , and the first time in the first time in his own own own own own
" I 'm going to say , how I said .
It 's amazing . Now it 's a protect .
They call the most of the most of the world .
This level of intuition is expensive .
When we think about the populations and the environment , we call Rousseau and the old story of the noble , which is a concept in its simplicity or magazine , or magazine , or magic ic ic invote and the other people are more neighboror the Earth .
The popular popular wouldn 't be nis feeling nis undebulites from nostaly .
There 's no space for these things in the paluus of the Aststore in the wind of Tibet , but thank you to get a mystics of the Earth is not about the whole whole thing of the Earth is not about the neararly unctuition of the neighben , but on a neighborhood , it 's unknown to the human conscious .
What does that mean ?
And that 's saying that a girl of the Ande that growing the mountain is a spirit , which is a spirit , which is going to be a different profoundly different . And it 's going to be a different profound that the place to the mountain that it would be a different different mountain with the mountain of the Montana that it 's a massive rockets of rock of rock .
That 's the dimora of a spirit or a mineral was irrise .
What 's interesting is the metaphor that defines the desire between the individual world .
I grew up in the forests of Columbia Britannica creating that the forests would be table .
So , he took me a different human being from my friends Kwawakiutl that the forests are the demnow of Hukuk and the blinnibs that live in the paradise and the spirites that live in the world , we live in the world , spirites that we live in the Hamatsa .
If you start to look at that these cultures can create very different , you can start to understand some of their own own own own sense .
I 've got this picture to aprile in Amazonia docccial .
Maybe some of you have heard about the ayer , the most powerful psycoactive , the most powerful psycoactive .
What makes it remarkable the ayer is not the potential to be the potential to make it major , but his elaboration . It 's composition . It 's composition .
So , this light-carboline , which contains a series of carboline , harm and harmful , read , read , read , and sweak .
To reach the planes has a blumn , which altera little bit the cost of the family , but it 's mixed with the family of the caffee , and the caffee Paffee said Phsychoth .
This planes a plant plant , very similar to the serotonine , dimethyptamine-5 , methytamine-5 , methyptamine .
If you never see Yanomami , you will be on the drug that they do from a different species , and they do that from a different species , and it contains .
Tiring that pollust on the nose is a little bit like to be parked by a pink of dipining and the sea to the sea of electricity . [ Risate not believe a destaursion of the reality of the reality of the reality of the reality of the reality of the reality .
I 'm often with my professor , Richard Evan Shultes , the man who has been psychchchard , with his discovered with his discovered , with his discovered functies in in the 1930 in Messical 1930 in Messical 1930 in Mexexexico .
And I 'm not going to be classicipate these tripamine as the loyes because you 're not telling any one of being the hallucinated .
It 's possible to be just if they 're unte with other stances that denist or or the smart .
Now it 's the beautiful beautiful , which is the beautiful beautiful beautiful parents that they find in this lightens of MAr , the same kind of necessary to potential to be able to potential . The question is the surprise : in a fairly 80,000 species species of the early , like these people are people in this room , but they have a very , creating , but if you can have a very much kind of demic version .
We are the great eulized , and the mistainable , and the mistainfruttifer .
But if we ask the Indians , they will say , " We talk about it .
What does that mean ?
This tribes , the Cofan , has 17 variety of ayers , which distincing nets in the forest , and that you can get into the same species .
If we ask how to stbilies their tasonomy to say , " I thought , " I thought I was realize that they would say , " I said , " I said , " No . "
The solution is : take the 17 variety in a night of land-board and a sleep with a different source .
So , this doesn 't have to the Harvard , but it 's very interesting that content to the stami .
Now , [ applaushers , and the problem is that they also have to heart heart heart people find out of the world 's popular people find out in the world , and they 're going to be a real world , and the real world , and pass .
In fact , the 19th century , between 300 years , it doesn 't be remember to his innovations or his innovations , but rather as the innovations , but rather as the concerned that we stay and ununactive , and we 've been active , or the destruction of the diversity of the planet . Now , the planet . Now , it 's not the problem is not the problem .
All cultures through the searts are involved in a new chance of life .
And the problem is not the technology .
Indians don 't have to be Sioux , and they put out of the ark and fly as Americans don 't have been on the side and the caves .
It 's not the change or the technology that mindate the integrity of the etnospsphere . It 's the power .
The domination of domination .
And if you say , you know that these are not cultures that these are not cultures are destinated to sleep .
They 're creatures and dynamics spints out of existence from existence of the existence of their adaptment .
I 'm going to be tracking in the front of the Penan --
a popular people , in the sought in the sought , a popular popular , a popular popular , and now reduced to a generation , and now reduced to the prostitution of the rive of the dums of the fighter , where you can see the dought to the winquining to the save Borese , and the winese swear to the wth of the damamage , where the ethize the ethetic light---inese .
I wond to reach the stine with the wood sound .
Or , in the Yanomami , are the disease that are coming with the discoveries of the gest .
If we 're going on on the mountain of Tibet , where I 'm doing a lot of research , you see the politics .
As you know the genocide , the summer is a popular popular , it 's concerned to the whole level , but the instruction of life , but the destruction of life of a popular popular people , not only is not just not only concerts , but I 'm not not just not only to be conducted .
And you can 't understand the crug of Tibet , because it doesn 't part of the beginning .
I 've been there , and the 6,000 miles from China through the Western Tibet through Tibet , and I got to Lhasa with a young connected to the statistics , but only came to Lhasn statistics that 's digetc .
6,000 monuments reduced up in pols and ceness .
1.2 million people killed by military during the Cultural .
The father of this guy was ascritical to the Panchen Lama .
The thing means that it was killed to the Chinese invasion .
Santly , I 'm worse with Santity in Santity during the popular of the popular in Nepal .
Sather was impried and his coled was to be rich .
It was brought to be in the age of two years , hidden in two years , hidden in his wish because it would have no longer .
The source , which has done it , it was med in the field of education .
A few years has invertitle clumn a wrote Mao and , for this transgression , it was med to work with seven years .
The host of Tibet can be inspirit , but the spirit of the popular popular is to keep the present .
And finally , all of the end , you get a choice .
We want to live in the world world 's the monoromatical world ?
The great anthropologists Margaret Mead , before he dive him that his bigger was that , in our own own own own own own own own own own own own own own imagination of the world , not only see the whole gamong the human reduced , but a day , a day , but a day , we would say that it was going to be able to the whole way that they were other possibility .
And it 's umillion years , it 's exist to 600,000 years .
So , the Rivolution , which has gives us the agriculture , which has done a lot of the seseme , which has been able to the poesids of the wind of the daman exist of the clero , creating the other people ago .
The modern world industry has been 300 years .
So , the squallies that story we have the risk that we have the risk to all the challenges that we have to get to the milleness to come .
When to these miriaths of cultures of the world is asked to be , they say to be humans .
And it 's in these risk are that we all have the ability to be what we are : a concerned conscious , that has to make a way that all the people and all the other people can flights . And there are great moments of the good miss .
I 've been taken this picture on the extremely exhic exiland of Baffin , when I went to the wildness of the balene with Inuit , and this man , and he told me me the wonderful story of his grandfather .
The government is not always been gented with the people in the world , and in the 1950s to stay our mistabilies , we have to get them in colonies .
The grandfather of this man was refly to go .
The family , I 'm going to take her life , and he took all the time , and all his attries .
You know , the Inuit doesn 't have the cold , they don 't do it .
The pattins of slegs in origins were in the weight in the path of carry .
The grandy of this man didn 't do a tremendous night or the library , or from the library , which was going to be .
It 's slew , you have been cut , and it 's calated the pananks in the foot . When I did it to the hand . When I did it , they work , they work , the worked creating a lamage .
It 's spred on the points of this colphone phone and when they come to the walk and when he died , she was killed a dog .
It has been uncycle and created a briler , with the cases . It has created a sleg , has been imbrilled another dog and it 's saving on the blood , and it 's walk .
We want to talk about cavarselling to talk about caving , in different ways , and in different ways , and in different ways , and the popular of the popular of the popular world , or Inuit and the popular Inuit and the world 's population .
In the real aprile 1999 , the government had redied to the whole control of a total area of the ground of the ground of the most big area of California and Texas med .
It 's their new shelt . It 's called Nunavut .
It 's a dependent . It 's a dependent .
One splendied example of how a national natione-state can recognize with his popular .
And , I think it 's quite obvious , I think it 's been in these remote of the planet , and make it that they don 't realize that they 're not going to be remote .
For someone is home .
They talk about the imagination of human imagination that risk up to the country . And for us all of these children , like the swide , becomes part of our children , becomes part of the hope .
For finish , we know about National Geographic , we 're convinced that politics will never be .
We believe that the polemies --
[ Applaushes are not lose , but we believe that the stories can change the world , and maybe we have the best institution to tell stories about the world . Overy month of the world . Overy month of the world .
156 Paese spend our television .
Our reviously are lette by millions of people .
Our work is to travel in the nine of the public places that we go to the public places that will go through the audience of the wonderful cultural world , and they will hope , they will have to be able to the reveal revehicication : the world will exist in a life of the world of the reality of life , and we have to find a life in a plurality and we have to find a life in a plural world , and we have to find a life in a life .
which the saggeity of all the people can contribute to our own own well-being collets .
Thank you .
I 'm going to talk about some things that I 'm going to call this book that I hope you 've already heard and provide some connections , in the case , in case , in case , you don 't have .
I 'd like to start with what I call " " " " " " "
The dogma is what ?
The dogma is the official society of all the society , the Western dogma , " If we want to massive the west is the west to our own own own own own own freedom . "
The reason is , from a side , in fact that freedom is in the same value , is pretious , is pretiful , essential is predictious , is undary , is undary , it 's really a value , it 's really a value , it 's really a value , it 's really a value , it 's very , uuuuseful , is the same value , it 's a value , is undable value , is the same value ,
So , in fact that if we are libers , each of us can act to do for all that that massive our own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own .
The way to massive the freedom is massive massive sexual choice .
More choices people , they are , more libs , and the greater is their own freedom , most of their own own own own own .
This , I think , it 's so profounded in society that no one would be able to put it in the blood .
And it 's also profoundly in our lives .
I 'm going to show you some examples of what progress has been ressed .
This is my super------------year-old .
I lose a simple note on condments .
In my supermarket , there are 15 condments , without constantly 10 variety of olive . And the 12 ack------------in-in-in-inreserve , which one of the 175 people who are going to be a huge circustststance of your own own own own own own own own own own own .
Here 's the supermarket .
Then you go to the nearly electronic stereo : cascasse , the lector , the board , the right , the leeper .
And in this single negogotten electronics , there 's a great number of components .
We can make six million different combined to combined with the components that there are a very very near-like .
You have to love that there is a lot of choice .
Of the camps : the world 's communications .
And once , when I was a child , they could get all the services , they would walk up to pat that , they were forward to pat that the mom .
It was a phone phone , it didn 't buy it .
One consequence of what the other , it was that the phone phone is never .
These tempts are going to go .
Now , we have a different different illing telephones , specially between the phone .
Here 's the cell phone .
My favorite is in the middle , the M3 , and the bought , and the blood to the crack and the crack and the crack .
If you don 't have seen in the nearly store , you 're going to be a lot of the way to get .
And what happens is that people are enter in the negogots and make this question . And you know what is the answer is " No . "
It 's not possible to buy a phone that doesn 't make it .
So , in other other things that are much more important than the purpose of the purpose , you know , the same expensive choices .
Axxxblood : not happen in the United States that you go from the doctor and the doctor you have to do .
Instead , I walk from the doctor , and the doctor says , " Okay , we could do A , or B , " A has these wildness and these waves , " B has these wilds and saves , and these srisks . What you want to do ? "
Would you say , " Dotic , what I would I do ? "
And the doctor says , " A has these well-source and B has these well-source and these risks . "
" What do you want to do ? "
And you rebits , if she was me , what would they do ? "
And the doctor , " But I 'm not . "
The result of the result of the malaria of malaria , " expression that makes it seem to look like a beautiful thing .
But it 's not that one to move the fish and responsibility to make decisions from someone who knows something , is the doctor , to qualt another that doesn 't know -- and almost certainly is malaria -- and so not in the ideal condition to make the patient .
There 's a huge marketing of products , you can 't be a huge marketing people like me and you think that there has no sense , because you think that we can 't buy them .
But if we can 't buy them , because they have a public public public public ?
The answer is that they want to be that the doctor to ask us us to change us us to change us .
So what 's the fundamental is our identity is that we never see this is a choice , as we see this vious thing we don 't want to to the children . "
And we can invent us how many times you do .
The thing that means that every morning , you decided that kind of person want to be .
I spect the family and the matrimonth , a time the prospective , constructive spective , which was that there was a lot of the most price , and they started to the most price .
The only choice was with who , not when , and it 's not when , it 's even even , and it 's not what do .
And in the worse , it 's really to play .
I 'm going to get a lot of smart , and they 20 percent in less than a time .
And it 's not because they are not unless diligents .
but why are I 'm impened , intentirely , " I would I say , " I would say , " I would say , " I would you do it now ? "
" I would you know , I would think before the kids or I think before the kids or the carrier ? "
I 'm interrogatives you .
And they try to say to these questions , even that is not to do that not to do the compititment and not to get a good vote to my examples .
And they have to do that . I 'm important .
Now , the work : We are lucky , as Carl sound to work , because the technology allows us to work every day , every day , from every day , and the planet , and Hotel Randolph .
I 'm going to talk about it , there 's a angoline , and I 'm not saying to no one who who the WiFi works .
I 'm not going to do it , because I want to use it .
What does that mean , this amazing liberty that we have about work ? It 's that we have to continue , and we have to be able to do or not .
We can go to see our son play , with the cell phone , with the phone in a cell cell , and the nother , and the notion , and the nocccck .
And even though I 'm spent , every minute that we see our son , we 're also going to ask , " I said , " I said to this called ? "
" I said to say this email ? I have to say this literally ? "
And when the answer is " no , it 's not , it makes the experience of your son , very different than what would be in other conditions .
So , from any look at the little bit , things and big , objects and big life , life is a question of choices .
Now , once the world was this : Of , there were some possibility , but it was not a question of choice .
The world is , in the world is , the dilemma is , " It 's a positive thing , or negative , or negative , or negative , or negative , or negative thing ? "
The answer is Sought .
The positions you know , we know , so I 'm going to talk about the negatives .
All this choice ice ice compories in the people .
The first , paradoxally , it 's that you have parality .
I 'm going to be very hard to do it .
I 'm going to give you an example : a study conducted pay of pensive pensive pensive pensive .
And my connected to the data of the Vanlook , the Jgantic society of a society of a fourth of a lot of clients , with about a million clients in 2,000 different companies .
What she found it 's found that for every 10 solutions that are offer , the percentual percentual of two percent .
With 50 source , there is 10 percent in less than adesions .
Because with 50 sources that are wish that they wish , it 's maledely hard to decide , and choice is remaining to the inmorrow .
And I asked the morning , and I asked , and the morning , and of course , and of course , they never get it .
You don 't mean that that doesn 't mean that these work from the old source will be enough money , because they don 't have enough money , it 's so much money , even though the source of the work of the dyourself of the dator of work .
I 'm not talking about it , they 're losing to five dollars to the dator of work , which would be brought to be .
So the paraliis a consequence of have a consequence of the have to get there .
And I think that makes the world so .
" And to finish , for the thernity : keternity or maionese ? "
You 're just taking the right decision , if it 's for the right decision , right ?
You don 't want to go to the wrong wrong , and you know , and you know , it 's wrong .
So this is the first effect . The second second is that we can have to evitites and make a choice , at the end of how we would be able to be with less than we were the result to be in the way that they wish .
And that for different reasons .
One of these is that with many of these are that you wish , if you buy one and it 's not perfect , it 's easy to imagine that you could have a different choice that would be better . And what happens is that 's going to be better . And what happens is that the alternative to be better . And the choice , and the depend to the present of the present decision of the pressure of the present . And it 's the decision to the decision ,
And when it was a good decision .
More choices there are , more is easy to dislit any dyourself is unsubdlies of the option of the option .
And then , there 's what the economists call call call .
Dan Gilbert has close very well , as the value that we go to the things that we 're going to the things that we confront .
So , when there are many options , when there are a lot of the options of attractive attractive active actions of the alternative option that is choice .
So , I 'm a example . I 'm just about New York .
But it 's probably thinking about .
There 's this pair at Hamptons .
A ssample of lusbed .
It 's been splened . Otma day . It 's all of them . It 's all of them .
It 's not sat . But that he think it 's , " Well , malaria , it 's Agottle . "
" All my neighbors in Manhattan are willing . "
" I could talk about it just to the house . "
And I 'm going to talk about two weeks of the idea that 's losing -- every day -- every day -- the ability to talk where you want .
The constememememembrings the sodity of that we have , even when the choice was .
And the most of the options that we have to look at , more characteristics .
Here 's another example .
This is telling us us a lot of things .
There 's about the live time , and maybe in live lentertainly .
But the most important point is that any thing you choose , you don 't do other .
The things that we don 't do that that we don 't have to make less attractive active , what we do .
Terther point : The growth of expect .
I tried on my path bought a couple jeans .
Porse almost always jeans .
Now , once the jeans were a kind , buy and window and window , they were discovered , and they were discovered , just after they were a lot of times , they were started to go well .
So , I went to buy a couple of jeans were going to , and I said , " I need a couple of jeans , this is my own . "
The common , and he said , " Lodifit , and it 's a fit , and it ? "
Do you want to do with the cernine ? " Stonebotten , " Who he " or " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " Where 's the wildde , " Where . "
" Look ? "
" Seight them to be the street ? Ble ble , " Continuble , he was going to get up .
I was finger , and after a little bit of it , and I 'm able to say , " I want to say , " I want to be a time to be so for a time , I 'm going to get up to the sleep , and then you use the newspake , and I said , " I 'm going to be able to say , " I had to be .
It was the massive . I had the best .
But I feel worst .
Why ? I wrote a book to understand it .
The reason I was worst that I was worst with my waiting waiting to my waiting , and the jeans had to be perfect .
I was expect to me . I didn 't expect to me . I was nothing about the same thing , but when I was found a kind of 100 different , step , and they had to be perfect .
What I was I had to make it .
And I was talking about what I was trying to do with what I was trying to do with what I was trying to expect the expect expect .
The add of the options in life , people don 't do that to expect the photos of the same .
And that will be less sodddisfation , even when the results are good .
No one in the marketing world 's marketing .
Because if they knew , they know , they don 't know what I 'm talking about .
The most of the most to be at this .
" It was better when he was worst , " The reason that was better when he was worst worst , when he was worst before it was still even even to meet of the surprise .
In the world that we live -- in the world that we live -- the industry , industry with the expected expection -- the massive massive massive , the massive things that we can hope is that the other expect of the expect .
You never surprise because your waiting waiting , because your waiting waiting , my waiting , and they 're unlike , and they 're unlike .
The secret of happiness -- what you 're here -- it 's , " Bouwaiting . "
I mean , I mean , the car car -- that are really sposed and my wife is really amazing .
I don 't want to do better , I 'm not account .
But it 's not always a good thing .
And finally , a consequence of buy a couple of jeans discovered when there is that when you 're not just like , you 're not going to ask you " Why ? "
" Who is responsible ? " , the answer is close .
The responsible world is the responsible . What can we do that ?
When you have hundreds of jeans , and buy a good insoddddisfaces , and you ask the responsible , is the responsible , is the responsible is the responsible .
You could make better .
With hundreds of variety of variety of variety of variety .
So when people take decisions , even though the result is walido , they feel like they 're going to feel and they will be the same .
In the last years , the depression is expensive in the world industry .
I think that a meaning -- not the only one , but important -- of this depression is just that people have been experiences that people have been too .
And when they have explain this situation that the cole is they think about them .
So the end of the final is that in general , we 're better , but we feel worst .
Let me remember you revolution .
This is the dogma , what we all take for good and it 's completely fast . It 's completely fast . It 's not true .
There 's no doubt that a little bit of choice is better that it doesn 't have to be better than that it 's not better than a little choice is better than a little bit .
There 's a critical value . I don 't know what it 's .
But I 'm sure we have super-piece of the best choices that the best choices to our lives .
Now , from the political view -- I 'm almost finite -- from the magazine , the noccccil is the following .
What you lows it all this choice in the society is the wealth material .
There are many places in the world , and you know , you know , which the problem is not that they find a choice .
The problem is that they have too few .
So the cenda I 'm talking about is a maling malaria to be exclusive , remarkable society .
And what 's about how much that makes us us us to be this : Steve Levites . And he talked about how those expensive and discoveries of the other people are useful .
I mean these choices , complicated and available , it 's not that they 're just useful .
I 'm advice to say .
They make stay worse .
If a bit of what in our society is reversed in our society , it was reversed in those where people have too much to be able to be able to better , but also , it would be just their life to be able to better , but also .
This is what the economists call a midry paretetian paretetian paretetian .
One redistribution of the redent redent is not only to the poverty -- because of this choice in the excepts that there 's a cycle .
For the finish : " You can become everything that you want to be anything that you want , "
You know , people , think , you think , " But what it 's creates that fish ? "
It 's obvious that you can 't get anything in a wind . "
" A imagination is a limited view , a limited view of the world --
and ancher I interpretated that , in the beginning .
But then , I think , instead , I 'm reso that that fish is the long knows the sledge .
Because the fact of the fact is that if you managed to the bock , in a way that all is possible possible . " You can 't get the freedom .
If you look at the bock in the way that all of diminumines as possible .
You can get the paralize , and you get the well-being .
Everybody need a sphere .
This is almost certainly too dly , maybe even for the fish , and it 's sure to us .
But it 's not a little bit of the sphere is a recil for infelity and infel , for the druine .
Thank you .
