I showed these slide demonstrate that the calotta glacial calotta , which is about three million years , had the size of the 48 of the United States of the 19th of the continental .
But this subject of the problem because it doesn 't show the spent of the problem because it doesn 't show the ice of the ice .
The glacial calottical , is in a sense , the heart of the climate system .
You 're invers and extend of ext and ext .
The next depositive will be a fast , it will be a faster than the last 25 years .
The ice ice ice perennia are designed in red .
As you see , you 're going to go to blue until the blue .
That 's the ice in the inverno , which is retired of ext .
You can see that the cosit said ice the ice of five years or more , it 's like health , you 're on the body , you 're going to be on the body .
In 25 years , it 's been on so ,
This is a problem because the warming warming , the extreme of the ground . And the ice of the rich , where there are huge amount of carbon , where there are huge amount of carbon microbes .
I 'm going to spect the totality of the inatmospspread from warming to the global warming , that amount could be dopay , super---re-come point .
In some of the laghi profound in Alaska metan is already rebolling from water .
The professorse Katey Walter of Alaska , and I got a team of a blow team of a blow fly .
Video : Wow ! Al Gore : I 'm going to be if you 're going to be .
A reason is that this is that this is that the termal re-scale .
This is a glacial regime .
The landed had never reached to be similar .
This is the Kangerlussuaq , in the sought of Groenland .
If you want to know how to know the sea level of the sea , you want to know , you 're going to be where the sea .
These deal are going to be fast .
The other part of the planet : Antards , the biggest block of the planet .
The month scientists have dichied that the bilange of the ice is in negative , and that Antards , which Antards , which is a few of sun , is starting to fastly in the sun , and it 's starting .
It 's six feet of the sea level of the acts , like Groenland .
Sulil Himalaya , the bigger , the third of ice , you see new laghi , who was glacious .
40 percent of the world 's worth half of the water will get to the water of the potail .
Sulle Ande : this glacier is the source of the water ,
The landed has increased .
But when you 're deminuble , the same happens to water potable .
In California , the neve on Sierra Nevada is diminusually .
The idrics are in crisis .
The predictions , as you know , you know , I 'm free .
The growth of sesecurity in the world , a remarkable .
The environmental disasterves a moment of the normal and without precedent .
Four times more numheroes in the last 30 years , I was 75 .
This is a whole sorts of all insustainable .
If you look at the context of the historic consequences .
In the last five years , we 've added 70 million tons of CO2 every 24 hours -- 25 million tons in the ocean every day .
Look at the area of the Pacific , from the American , from the American , and to come out , and on the subcontinent , where there is a degree , where there is a degree of the nexgene .
The major ccause of global warming , together to the deforestation , which is 20 percent , it 's the use of combustible .
The oil is a problem , and the carbon is even worse .
The United States are one of the two of the several countries , together to China .
And it was proposing to build many other central carbon .
But we 're going to have a changing changing .
These are the projects in the last few years and proposes some of alternative alternative .
every way , there 's a political lower in our Paese .
The carbon industry of oil , they have spent 250 million dollars in the last year to promote the carbon , which is a obsiggggold .
And I remember the picture of something --
I know Natale , in Tennesst , where I live , there was a 3.8 billion light-lighter light-slegs .
Maybe you saw on the news .
This is the second larger flow of last last brought in America .
It 's happened around Natale .
The publicity of one of the carbon industry was this .
Video : â™« Frosty coal is a kind of allegro and happy .
It 's abundying here in America , and it 's growing our economy .
Frosty carbon is always more pulit .
It 's a good price , and they 're working with the horable .
Al Gore : So , here is gran part of West Virginia .
The bigger society minerary on the mountain is Massey Comper . This is his friendly .
Video : Don Blankenship : I 'll be clear -- Al Gore , Nancy Peless , Harry Reid -- they don 't know what they 're talking about .
Al Gore : So , the Alleance for the Protextion of Clima has two campaight .
This is a part of them , a part .
Video : Acore : Alla COALergy we see the climate change as a sery to our business .
So , our priority is to invest a big amount of money in a public public , and it uses uses the verity of the carbon .
In fact , it 's not sporite .
We think it 's clean -- it 's also -- it 's a good profum .
So , you don 't precummmultiply .
Let me do it .
Video : Acore : Carbone , you 've heard a lot of talk about .
So we 're going to make a structure to look at the building for the carbon as much of carbon .
Straordinary ! The machines are a little bit of rumorous , but this is the sound of the carbon technology .
The carbon consumers is between the main of global warming , but the remarkable of global warm , but the technology of carbon , you see changes all .
You have a look : this is the technology of carbon .
Al Gore : Inally , the alternative , the alternative , and the sesesecurity and the security of the national security .
Video : The America is in the crime ; the economy , the national economy , the national climate crime .
The fix that we can all , our dependence from combustible , as carbon sporite and oil oil .
Now , I 'm going to have a new new , audace ,
Remember , America : 100 percent of energy , in 10 years .
A plan to go to the work , and it makes us sure , and help us to stop the global warming .
Finally , a solution that we baste to solve our problems .
Remember America . Scoprite of the most .
Al Gore : This is the last .
Video : How much : I 'm going to report energy to America .
One of the fastest ways of the faster than the combustible from combustible to help our planet .
So , it 's the future is here . I 'm here . I 'm going to a new energy .
Exxxist : Nures for the four of work of work ,
Anyment : Repower . It 's time to be realists .
Al Gore : A old proverbio African old , says , " If you want to go to faster , you go to fast .
If you want to go away , you go together . "
We have to go away , so quickly .
Thank you very much .
Last year year , I 'm a introduction on the LHC .
And I promise to traveling to traveling on how the car works .
So , I 'm going to do it . And for those that the other time , the LHC is the biggest experiment ever , the big experiment ever , 27 kilometers of conference .
His compask is is to rereach the conditions that were less than a billion times in the universe -- until 600 million times in the universe -- until 600 million times a second .
All of this is just environmentally .
This is the machine under Ginevra .
We have a hour , we have these min-Big Bang in the refer .
This is what I work . This is called ATLAS -- it 's a 44 feet and has a diameter of 22 meters .
This is a spacular picture of ATLAS in building so you can see the proportions .
10 sets of sets last year , we acceso the car for the first time .
And this picture was taken by ATLATLAS .
It was made of immense to festeggiving in the health of control .
It 's a picture of the first of particles that had done all the LHC , both of the LHC , and you 're going to be collision , with a part of the HC , and spread particles into the reflit .
In other words , when we see that the 10 sets of the 10 sets , we understand that the machine was going to work , the big vitten .
I don 't know if this was this to make us more or this , when someone went on on Google and vide that the pages was this .
That means we had a cultural impact of the scientific ,
And I was a week later , there was a problem with the car , to these brought here -- these files here -- these files here .
These file file 13,000 print when the machine works in the massive of potence .
Now , the technicians between you will look at the children and say , " It 's not not . I 'm too too too too sotles . "
And instead they can do it because they 're very cosiddling the super---tails .
So , at least 271 degrees , to a temperature of the space between the stars , these things can bring that walk .
In one of the giuntures between the most noveal noveal , there was a defect of fect fect .
So , the file of the bits , and 13,000 of the focus of the 13,000 , they were met a resistence .
This was the result of the result .
Now , this is more impressive if you think that these magneti fish are more than 20 tons , and you 're moving about 30 centimeters .
They 're sitting about 50 magneti .
We had to take them , what we did .
We 've been repressed and travel .
They 're going to get all to their place .
By the end of the LHC will be going to be again .
We 'll access to get , and we expect to get data or the right right , and we 're going to go to find what the morons that are the morning that are the universe .
Now , of course , in a way , these incidents return the debate of the value of science and engineering the engineering of the engineering and engineering in front of the engineering .
I think the fact that the fact that the fact of the limits , I think this is the value of things like LHC .
I want to end with the words of a English scientist , Humphrey , which , imagine , you can 't imagine , in difense of the experiments of his own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own human mind , how human riters are , and the human human beings of human mind , which is that there are not a whole whole whole . "
Thank you .
I want to start to start to ask you , when , you 're played by children , play the morning on the morning .
And as you can understand how to reach and take them , and you take them , and you 're going to move and solve problems and solve problems and solve problems .
The space is deeply connected to the way we understand the way we understand the way we understand the way around us .
So , from information to the inspired of our interaction with objects , with my own own own paper , and my collaborator , and my collaborator , and my collaborator , I started to ask me , " And if , when we use a computer , instead of having the winner of the mouse of the mouse that it 's going to be a sor , we could be able to look at a sor , you can 't have a sleep sor or your hands , with a sor , with a sin , with your hour ,
And it would you like our please ?
The question was so interesting that we decided to explore the answer , and it 's going to build the answer , and it was so interesting .
In a few words , a Siftable computer is a great computer interactive as a biscot .
In a few words , a Siftable computer is a great computer interactive as a biscot .
And you can move with your hand , they can see , " between them , " You can see the way , you feel the way and a wireless .
But it 's basically , they 're physical objects , like the morning , you can just be able to be able to be able .
The Siftable is an example of a new ecosystem to manipulate information to digital information .
And man who are going to become more physical , conscientists , of other , and and hand that become more physical , and they 're going to be more physical , of how we move , we can exchange new new and different different different interaction .
I 'm going to start with some simple example .
This Siftable is configurate to show you a video : if you put it into a direction , video rotherwise , the other side of the other side of the back .
These reforms are conscientists are conscious to others .
If you know , you know , they 're interested in what they 're interested in .
If they 're going to be circumit , and they can be a little bit .
If they 're going to be circumit , and they can be a little bit .
They also have their movement and injlination .
We 're realized that one of the interests of the interaction of the interaction was able to use the common data , to example , " a color like a liquid as if it was a liquid .
In this case , we have three Sifle-configurate as a bunch of vernice and I can use it to the color , where they put it .
and I can use to use it to the color , where they 're missing .
If we 're too too , we can get a little bit of place .
I 'm also also beautiful possibilities of the mathematics and games , the mathematics and games where people can try things things as well , and you see the results of the time , and you see the results of the time .
Now I 'm now --
This is a Fibonaccount , I do with a program of equations .
Here we have a game of words that 's going to half a little bit of the Scarabeo and Boble .
Pratically , at every turnal , you 're a literally in the Siftable , Pratically , to every Sifly on the Sifts of any of the Sifable of a dead .
And then , after about 30 seconds , and you have a new set of land-s-set and new possibilities to try .
Thank you .
So , here 's how children came to Media Lab , I did it in a way I tried to put them and I went a video .
They are very please .
And one of the things of this , you know , it 's not to give people many education .
You just say , " Compon the words , and they 'll be exactly what to do .
Here 's how other people are trying to do it .
This is our young tester tester than there , there 's right .
It was actually wanted to just impilate them .
They 're only morning , for him .
Now , this is an application of a interactive carton the interactive .
We wanted to build a tool for the Lui of the language .
It can be new characters in the song , you can get their own associated .
It can be new characters in the song , you can get their own associated .
Here 's , it 's doing the sun .
Video : The sun is source .
David Merrill : Now , she took a treat the scene .
Video : The treat the hold .
Bel work !
So , you 're going to get the Siftable and put neighborhood --
Video : Bau !
-- inventing your story .
Video : Han .
DM : It 's a story with the open , and it can decide him how you svolts .
DM : It 's a story with the open , and it can decide him how you svolts .
Video : Very on , thiron ,
DM : The last example I have the time to show you is a tool , I 'm going to show you , to camp and exeguing music .
It 's a tool , I made of recent , to camp and exegut music .
The Siftable here are aged by the bottom and bacteria .
Everybody of these have four different variations , and you can get to use .
You can also insert these sues in a compories to your pleasant .
And it just to make a sell , they 're going to take a " sequence . "
These are actually actually able to control from the vision , like the reverber and the filter .
It 's a particular , and then the inclins to get it .
And then , there are the general effects as time and fly , they 're applicating to the intersequence .
Let 's look at how it works .
Video : We 're going to be able to make a base in two Siftable sequence , we 're going to put a series , we 're going to go , and we add the other basic .
Now I put a based line of the bottom line .
Video : Now I add to go to percussions --
Video : And I 'll put the filter to the bacteria , so I can control the effect of the bacteria ,
Video : I can fasted the intersequence to the whole sequence , the way on the other side of the other .
Video : And I 'll be now now add the filter to give more expression .
Video : I can look back to the sequence . "
So I don 't have to planning , but I can improved , and then then the longer or the cords .
And now , I can spend the intersequence to the whole sequence to the Siftable to the Siftable . "
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is to build new new interfaces like our brain and body to work our brain and body .
And I had time to show you one of the result of this performs , and some chance that we try to get out from the lab .
And I 'm going to get to you is that it 's coming to this new generation of objects to interact with digital media media , which will take information in our world that we want .
Thank you very much .
I don 't see the now of you .
I 'm a wrote .
I 'm going to be books is the profession , of course .
It 's also love and the love of my life .
And I don 't expect that it can change .
But , this particular , something particular , it happened to my life and in my life , and I got me to get to recalibrate the interior I 'm going to get the interior with this work .
The particular thing is I 've written this book , this whography called " Mang , Pra , " which , diversely , diversely , the diversity of my books , and it 's a great feelational , and it was a great feelational , bests , bests , bests , bests , bests , bests , you know , you know , you know ,
And the result is that everywhere where you go now , people are treated as if you were conconstructed .
It 's true -- you 're confted .
They 're going to get up and I 'm going to tell me , " You don 't have a little bit more to do ?
You don 't have a little bit of going to write for all of life without able to create a book that can be able to create a book that can be able to make someone ? "
What you can important to someone ? "
It 's unsure , you know .
But it could go worse , at the way , I remember , I 'm going to say to people -- I was a wrote , I was a wrote -- I wanted to be a wrote writing .
And I was inagainst the same reaction .
And people said , " Do you don 't have to be successed ?
You don 't have a billion of the refied of the refly killed you ?
You have no fear to do this mestius for all of life without nothing nothing to go out and die on a cure sleep on a cure sample of a pig of sleep ? "
So , you know .
The answer -- the short answer to all these questions is , " You . "
I 'm just just just all of those things .
I 've always had a lot of feeling .
And I also have a lot of other things that people couldn 't have to indeed .
As the alth and other things spent .
But , how much about I was going to write what I thought and I 'd ask me last monstrstraight me is because ?
It 's rational ?
It 's a logical that everyone to expect to be spent from a job that you sent to do .
But what is that 's so particular in the impressive creative and make us nervous to the health health health health foreign , and so other people don 't do ?
How my father , for example , he was a engineer engineer and not remember one time in his 40 years of activity in his 40 years of activity in which the people were asked if they were paper ?
There was never -- that block of the engineer John , how ?
It didn 't work so , you know ?
Onestly , the engineers like group have no certainly , in the sees , in the several , reputation of the reputation of being alcolized .
We have to scrators , we have this reputation , and not just scrats , but creatives of every , we have this reputation of a huge met .
And it 's not to look at the trials of the magniques of the magniques that , only in the ventesimum century , they die young and often for their own , they 're often going to young and often .
And even the ones that you don 't have to be so so they 're not going to be so so they 're not going to be made by their dones .
And Johman Mailer , before , in the last interview , he said , " Everything my book , he killed a little bit more extraordinary of their life .
But we don 't have the final , when we feel these things so much of the things that in some way , we 're totally interiorized and accepted the notion that creativity and the art , and the art , and the art , and that art , at the end , to be always going to to get the ange .
And the question I want to take all today , you 're doing this idea ?
And you know , you know , because you 're also looking at a centimum of a hundred of distance to me not this support .
I think it 's odious .
And I think it 's also dangerous and I don 't want to see the next century .
I think it 's better to encourage our big minds .
And I know , in my case -- in my case -- in my situation -- it would be very dangerous to be able to start to be able to be able to be able to be able to be in my career .
Of course -- I look at , I 'm pretty young , I 'm pretty young , I have about 40 years .
I 've got about four decades of work in me .
And it 's very lilikely that everything I 'm going to be right now to come from the world as the work that used to be used to success of my last book .
I 'll slavery , because we 're all more or less friends here -- it 's likely that my big success was my own own own .
Oh , Gesus , who thought !
You know , this is the kind of thought that door a person to start to be on the day in the morning and I don 't want to do it .
I would keep going to keep this work .
So , the question is it , like ?
And so , it seems to be , after many , which the way to work to keep the way to be able to make a psychological costruct , OK ?
I had to find a lot of security between me , I 'm writing , and my natural anxial , and my natural anxial , and I 'm trying to get to go through the time , and I 'm trying to look through the time , to look through the time , to look through time , to find other society to see if they could have the best ideas and more sane and more sane to see if they could have to have the best ideas and sane to have the best ideas and sane of the best and to have to be able to see if they could have the
how to help people believe that are creative to make people people create inerent risks of creativity .
And that research , I took me to the Great and old Rome .
Seguiteme because I 'm gira in cere and then it back .
In the ancient of Great and anthic Rome -- people don 't seem to believe that creativity came to men , OK ?
And it was thought that creativity was this spirit to be the wine and that they came to men from a few people who are , and you know , for the distant distant and unknown , to know .
The greats were called these becomes to the search of creativity .
Socrate , wonderful , he believed to have a demon that , and they were going to be able to get away from away .
The Roands were of the same idea , but we were the kind of spirit ,
Which is great , because the Roands didn 't really think that a genius was somebody particularly smart .
They think that a genius was this species of degrees that were living in the murs of a study of a study artist , a little bit like the elf of a jobby , and that I would be able to be able to come out of the argue and the result of that work .
Here 's the wildness -- here , that 's the distance of which I 'm talking -- that costruction psychological struction that you protects of your work .
And they all knew that was so that he worked , right ?
So , the artists were protected by certain things , like , for example , as a too narcisive narcisive , no ?
If your work was excited you couldn 't take it all the wild , you all knew that you were helped by this genius .
If your work faild , it wasn 't all all of your work , right ?
And they were all knew that was your genius to be a inhererent .
And so people han creativity in Occient ,
And then the Rinasure came and all the changed , and the big idea ; we put the human being on the center of the universe on all the way on the universe on all the misters and without the largest space to believe that they 're windanced from divinity .
This was the principle of humans and the people began to think that creativity came to think that creativity came from the ilighter .
And for the first time in history , you 're starting to referred to this or that artist as a genius to a rather than a person with genius .
And I have to say , I think it was a big mistaining .
I think it allow somebody , a simple person to believe that as a recil of being like a recipient as the source , and the source of all the mysteries , creativous and the indict of an injury , and you have a sability to be too big to give to the human psysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysysynthetern .
It 's how to ask someone to ingoal .
It 's deforms and deforming and creates all these informance and expaning all these ingestors .
And I think it was this pressure to have destruction to have been in 500 years .
And if this is true , and I think that 's , and I think that 's the question , and now ?
We can do it .
Maybe I 'll go back to a more antical companies of human relationship between human relationship between human relationship between human relationship between human relationship between humans and mystery .
Or maybe no .
Maybe we can 't have 500 years of thinking about a deal in a talk of 18 minutes .
And there are probably people in the audience that would be laited to the scientific subjects on the notion of , insuspect that they followed people to get the next to the projects .
I 'm going to be able to convince you all about this thing .
But the question I 'd like to take is -- why no ?
Why don 't you think about this way ?
Because it 's more more than any other thing that has ever heard to explain the imprevision of the creative process of creative process .
A process that , as anybody who ever ever I 've been doing something -- so , basically , all here -- you don 't understand .
And , in fact , it can be completely paranoral paranoral .
I did this inagainst recently , with the extraordinary Ruth Stone , who has 90 years , but he was a few years , but he was a few of the source in the rural Virginia , and he felt , and I felt , and I felt , if a pounds , when a poor was the wild of the wild .
And he said that it was like a fragorous of the air .
And that came out to her from the paesh .
It 's going to feel , because it was to try to get the land under his feet .
He knew that was one thing to do with that point and was of , his words , " Would you like a matta . "
And so you can see it on the home and it was going to come from this poor , and it would not have to get a piece of card and a match enough enough enough , as the traph , and it was going to page .
And I couldn 't be fasted enough , so he would correct and correct and correct without getting home and the poor and she was going to get home and she had to go to the paper , and she had to go through the paesper , trying , like she said , " another poet . "
And then there were those times -- this piece of not dementiches , I 'll never -- there were almost losing , OK ?
So , he was going to go home and she was trying to get the poor and she was a math , and he was a math in the time , and he was going , and then he said , " as if you get the other hand and the stefferted .
And he was going to get the poesist from the coda and he would come into his body and the page of the page .
And in these cases , the poesia would be presented on the perfect page , and I 'm in the last word to the first word .
So when I feel the thought -- it 's paper , it 's exactly the same thing to my creative process .
I don 't have my creative process -- I 'm not a construct !
I 'm a mud , and my way to work is ; I 'm going to go to the same orary every day and work and go back to work and go into the goal .
But even I , in my wider , I 've been on the front of that , I 've been on the front of that , sometimes .
And I think that even many of you have the han .
You know , even if the work and ideas , they came out of a certain source , you can 't be source .
And what this is ?
And how can we relate to it in a way to make us , but , rather , rather , what we do you get to do it ?
As I 'm going to be a better example , I have the best example I have the musician of the Waits , which I interviewed a few years ago for a day .
We were talking about this , and you know , Tom , for the majority of life was the injury of the articst of the argued of several , trying to control , to control , and to start , to start to control these species of impults .
But then I 'm going to invecting , and a day as he was driving on a car in Los Angeles , changed all for him .
It was going to go faster and all of a tract of a little bit of melodia , who came into his head like , and it 's going to be , elusional , and you know , and you know , it 's wonderful , and you know , it 's wonderful , and you know , but it 's not like to take it .
It 's no piece of card , it has no card , it has no registrator .
So I began to feel this species of old species of old old growing up , " I 'm going to lose , and I 'm going to go out to this sessionate sessionate .
I 'm not good enough and I can 't do it . "
And instead of going to go to the panic , you 're going to stop .
And I 'm going to go to the whole process and did something completely new .
I 'm just going to look at the sky and said , " Scuses , I 'm not seeing that ? "
" You know that it 's going to write a song now ?
If you really want to be , you know , you can take a more opporting when I can take me me of you .
And you 're going to be able to important qualcone more today .
You 're going to disturbing Leonard Cohen . "
And his process worked changed after this .
It 's not the work , the work was still always always always always .
But the process , and the fish that was that he was reted when he was reted when the genius , the genius of him out of him , and the freef of the other things and libered to go back to where they were , and it was going back to where they were , and I 'm going to be a whole thing and I was .
But it 's a little bit of , wonderful bizarra , a collaboration between Tom and this strange and this strange and the outside .
So , how the story that I was so so , I was also going to change a little bit the way I was I I was going to have a time .
This idea , I was going to save me when I was write , " Mang , and I 'm going to be a disastern , and I 'm going to be able to be able to do something and we 're working on something and we 're going to start with something and I 'm going to be a disaster , which is going to be the worse .
It 's not just good , right , right , right , the book written .
And I began to think of geping this project .
But then I remember to Tom I talked to the air and I try to go to the air and I try .
So I was my face on the sought and I get my face to a vacuum of the room .
And I said to go , " Surch , what , you 're going to be brilliant not going to be so colst , no internally , no internally , no internal ?
Because as I see I 'm going to see all I have , I don 't have this .
So if you want to be better , you have to tell you and do your part .
OK . But if you don 't do it , you know what , I don 't do anything .
I 'm going to write the same because it 's my work .
And I 'd like to do favor that I 'm just going to do my part of my part of the time , I 'm so , OK -- it 's so , you know , in the desert of the Northern Africa , people were roundances to slea , and music , and music , and music and music that they were going to forward to the way and the way to the way .
And they were always magnifer , because the ballerins were great , and they were fantastic .
But every so , you know , something happened , and one of these artists became actually transcendent .
And I know what you know , because I know , because I know you all saw , a moment , a performance so .
It was as if the time , and the ballerwalk through a species of the ballerwalk through a species of the military , and it was not different from the soldier , and it was all all of them .
And at the improviously , I don 't look at a human .
But it 's acceping from the divinity of divinity .
And when this happened , I was , you know , the people knew what was , they were , they were called him .
They were the hands and began to dot , " Allah , Allah , Allah , God , " God , God , God , " God , "
That 's God , you know .
And it was a note -- when the More invaser , I was the More of the Spaign , I was this above their and the pronunced to the sears , Allah , " Ole , " Ole , " Ole , " You , " Ole , " which you can even feel in the cords .
In Spaiaign , when a artist has done something impossible and magic , " Allah , Allah , I was good , " incompanies , you know , it 's a last thing .
And it 's great because we need .
But , the problem is coming up the day , for the ballerself , when you slow and discover that are the 11 of Martedday and I 'm going to go to the day , and it 's not .
It 's just a mortal with gran bad bad bad to the ginock , and maybe they don 't have to make it altail .
And maybe nobody will you have the name of God still , and what 's to do with the rest of his life ?
It 's hard .
This is one of the sweweweet to make in a creative life .
But perhaps not to be so angoscious if you can 't believe , and so many of your own being being from you can 't believe , you know , you 're going to be from you .
But you 're just going to have you to be good data in prested by a source of this team of your life that you have to go to somebody else else .
And , you know , if the pend , we think , in this way .
And so I began to think , and it 's sure as I 've been thinking about for different months in the book that I 'm going to be going to do on , the dangerous , I 'll be followed to my big successful .
And what I have to keep me when I feel electured me when I feel it 's not not to have feeled .
It 's not just your work . It 's just your work .
Continua to presentation to your part , any can be .
If your work is balling , you know , you know .
If the divine , it assurgeon , you assigned to let me take some kind of wonderful , for a just moment through your own own , then , " Ole ! "
And you 're , you 're going to do the same dance .
And " Ole ! " You know , you know , you know ,
I think I 'm going to teach it .
" Ole ! " You know , you know , even for having love human testods and testing to make you continue to make you continue .
Thank you .
Thank you .
June Cohen : Ole !
As I 've been talking about some of these projects on genome , on what it can meant and the discovery of new genes of genes .
We 're starting a new perast : we started to digital biology and now now now we 're going to digital that digital , we 're both into a new phase of biology , design and so intetize .
We 've always tried to take big questions .
What is the life ? " That 's something that many biologists I think of the lives of smoves .
We 've been trying to get different , and then you get to the minims .
We 're digital digital from almost 20 years , we 've never .
When we sequenced the human genome was treated . And when we came from the analogical world of the digital biology of the computer biology of the computer .
Now , we can we take the life , we can we regenerate life , or to create new life from this digital universe ?
This is the map of a little organism , the Mycoplasm Mycoplasm , which is the species of the little bit of those who can authorian income .
And we tried to reduce the genome to create a little bit more .
We 're able to eliminate a hundred of genes of about 500 .
But when we look at a met to his map , it 's relatively simple than our .
It 's just a great .
But when we look at all the genes that we can get , one at the time , it 's very improved that this can bring to a living cells .
So we decided that the only forth to progreed was to be intended this chromosoma in a way to be able to provide some of these fundamental questions .
And so we started the adventure of the " Can we can be a chromosoma ? "
It can be able to make these big molecules that we 've never been able to create before ?
And , in case , we can make a chromosoma ?
A chromosoma is just a piece of material chemical material .
The speed we 're able to digital life is growing to go to report life .
We have to write the genetic code , instead , instead , but it 's really really really better .
And our most recent results the exponential on a curve .
We 've been began more than 15 years ago .
The process of a biothetic revision , starting with a bioetc revision before I began to experiments .
But we discovered that synthesize DNA is very hard .
There are a few thousands of cars in the world that produces are small segments of DNA , in the long , and it 's a degenerative process : the biggest segment is , the most mistakes .
So we had to develop a new method to assembling these frammines and correcrect the mistakes .
And this was our first tentertainment , and we began to the digital digital genome of the X 174 .
It 's a little virus that kills that kills .
We designed the fragments , effective the correction of the mistakes and get a molecule of DNA to about 5,000 lectary .
The interesting part is when we took this piece of chemical material , and we put it in the bacteria , and we insered in bacteria , and they began to read this genetic code and protected particles .
The viral particles are then then left by cells , they 're back and they destructed the cells .
I talked about recent with a Coundate of the oil industry , and they 're saying that they 're certainly understood this model .
They have more than you .
We think this is a situation where the software can really build his same hardware in a biological system .
But we wanted to do things things in big .
We wanted to build the whole chchromosoma .
I 'm more than 580 mile of code code .
So we thought we 're building it in the size of the virus , so we can change the cassets of the virus , so that they 're the components of a living cells .
The design is crucial , and if we start with digital information in a computer , these have to be very accurate .
When we sequenced this genome for the first time in 1995 , the accurate , it was a mile for every 10 mile .
We found , we found , 30 mistake , 30 mistaining , we used that sequence never been able to do it work .
One part of the process is designing , and 50 land-s-up , and they 're very little bit of 50 land-land-up , to build subunity to build subunits to build subunits work together .
We 're going to be the only one here .
You can be able to read that we 're going to look at the fire .
So , think , we have a clude code on four lectary , and C , and To .
And of those lepts together , they 're going to take about 20 frighghter , and there 's a specific order to spend every frighght-to-wish .
So we can use the genetic code to write words , frants , you can think .
What we did at the beginning was autograped .
Some of the fact that it wasn 't .
We designed these segments to be just just only only one to be able to come with the essentially .
There are some of them that are refly and put them .
And we started to assemble of parts , starting with segments from five to seven mile , unended up to 72 segments , 24 4 , the land-up landed to 72 .
So , every step we 've produced these segments in abond so to be able to create a extremely robbits -- as you 'll see in a minute .
We 're trying to automatives the process .
So , this seems to be the tabellon of a board of the boket .
When we get these sitting in these very long , more than 100 miles , they don 't grow up , they 're not going to grow up in the E.
It 's coming to the modern of the modern tools of biology biology .
So we 've been considered other mechanisms .
We knew about another month called recombination and recombination , which in biology , in biology , and it 's ulized DNA to refly the segments .
Here 's a example .
This organism , called Deinococcus radiodurans , you can assupply three million radiation of radiation .
You can see in the sometimes as his chromosoma came up .
In 12 -- 24 hours , it was reassemble as it was before .
They 're using thousands of organisms that are able to do it .
These organisms can sit completely .
They can live under the vacuum .
I 'm absolutely sure that life in space , and you feel to find new environment .
And the real , the NASA has showed that this is .
This is a picture of molecule we built with these processed , just using the liffet-up design design of segments .
The lived on the authomatically .
This picture is not been taken with a microscope of electronic microscope , but with a microscope .
It 's a molecule we can see the whole with a microscope .
These are photo covered a period of about six seconds .
This is the publishing that we did little time ago .
I 'm more than 580,000 land-claunch .
It 's the bigger of a definite structure of a defined structure of man .
It has a lot of several superior 300 million .
If you 're going to stick a caratter 10 without spaces , you 'd like 142 page to be about this code .
Now , how do we work ?
Of course , a virus is a game from kids .
It 's a little bit more complicated when you use of bacteria .
It 's simply simple when it 's the cells , it 's the cell of our : you can just be able to be the nucleo and inseries another , which is basically the process of cloning .
In the bacteria , the chromosoma is , instead of integrated into the cells , but we have recently demonstrated that we 're able to make a little bit complex cell to another and active .
We 've got a chromosoma , we 're going to be a microbial ,
The two are different as men from the topes .
We 've added some gene in the more way to decide what to do for this chromosoma .
And then I 'm going to be able with the protects .
And when we put the cells , it was study -- and you 're going to be study -- and you 're going to be the new chromosopher -- the new chchromosoma , it 's going to into the cells .
And we began we were not able to go beyond , but we tried to spinging us over there .
This is one of the major mecchanisms of evolution .
We found that many species have added a second or a third chromosoma somewhere , add in a second thousand new traits in the species .
So who think about evolution as a gene , as a gene , you know , it doesn 't understand gran part of biology .
They 're sitting in the maintain , called me , " It 's going to be able to digerve DNA DNA .
The chromosoma that was in the cells that it wasn 't one .
The cell phone chromosoma we have insert to the chromosoma that has .
It 's expressed , and he recognition the other chromosoma as material , and we 're recognized with only cells , and we 're just just going to get the cells and the new cell .
It became blue because of the genes we 've been insered .
And in a short levers of time , all the characteristic , and you have been transformed in a new species , the new species , the new new species , which we have insered in the cells .
All the proteins have changed , the membrane , and when we law the genetic code , and when we 're going to read .
Now , this may seem alchmy genetic genetic , but altering the software , and we can change things in a lot of ,
Now , I 've already explain that here is not talking about genesis -- but I 've been going to go to three million years and a half of evolution , and I said that maybe we 're going to create a new version of the Cambrian exhibition where they 're going to be new species on this digital .
Why do you do this ?
I think it 's enough enough when we think about our necessity .
We 're going to go to six billion and a half billion people in the next 40 years .
Right to give a example : I 'm born in 1946 .
Now , there are three people on the planet for every country in 1946 ; in 40 years , there are four .
We 're going to get to find food , water , and you 're going to find food , and you 're a half billion and a half billion people .
It will be more than billion to do it for nine billion .
We 're going to be more than five billion carbon , more than 30 billion baries , more than 30 billion baries .
That means that I 'm a millions of baries to day .
When we try to find biologists , or any kind of process to get them , it will be a huge challenge .
In the most we have to keep the whole of the CO2 , these materials that you end into the atmosphere .
In the day , thank you to discovered scientific discovered all the world , we have a database with about 20 million genes , and I like to think that are designed for the future .
The electronic industry , it 's just a dozen of components , and think of these different things are out .
our limits here are the constent data from the biological reality and our imagination .
Now , we have a techniques , because of these metods of synthetization , in order to create what we call genomics .
We 're able to build a big robot that can produce a big robot that can produce a billion chromosomes .
Think of processing these 20 million genes or to try to get to get the processes to produce either , and they can change , new vaccines , and we can change , thank with a little team , and create more biology now now now now now that in 20 years of science .
And it 's just a standard ,
We can choose for possibilities of survival , production or chemical , production of waccines .
This is an instantanea of some software programmed that we 're working to be able to several and design species species to be able to make us design species .
Well , we don 't know how they will be .
We know exactly , it 's their genetic code .
We 're now fourth of the generation of the generation of the generation of the fourth of the generation of the fourth of the generation of the carburts .
You know , you know that I 'm going to extract from the gram was a final experiment .
We have carburant second and third generation that they 're going to be able enough to the slow of the neighborhood as the either , they 're different kinds of deal .
But the only way the biology that biology can have a big impact without increasing the cost of food and limititaren the concert of food and limitbility to be transforming the cell that you can be able to design cells that you can reach this to design cells that you can get the first carburts of a few , and we think of it , and we can see the first carburts .
The light solar light with the CO2 is a metodo-- but in our discovered in our discovered , we found different metods .
This is a organism we described in 1996 .
It 's going to go out , about 2,0000--foot temperature of the water .
They 're using the CO2 using idrogene molecular as a source of energy .
We 're trying to understand if we can indeed the CO2 , which can be transformed to be transformed to be transformed to the CO2 in carbon , to make this process .
So , we can think we could be able to be able to aumentate what the question of the base of " which is the life , " We 're going to be able to repay the whole thing of the food industry .
Exactly . If you don 't do it from TED , where you can ?
It would be a main of energy .
And then , we 're working for the same metods to create vaccines .
You 've seen this year with the influence , we 're always going to go to a dollar , and with a dollar , and it 's going to find the wine .
I think what you can change with vaccines in a little bit of anticiicipate .
Here 's how the future could start to change , now , the trees , now , the trees of evolution with bacteria , you 're going to be able to be able , or cell cells .
We 're so on the best people .
Our discover is to make a way of living enough to make it . Thank you very much .
First of all of you can see , the faster possible , some fundamental , of the new technology that we took to Microsoft , and a almost a year ago . This is Seadragon .
It 's a environment where you can interact is to a local level of visual data that remote with a huge amount of visual data .
So , we 're seeing a lot of gabyte of digital phoom , with a kind of zoom , and it 's continuous , for a fastern , you have the images like we want .
And it doesn 't matter how big the amount of information that we see , how big these things are , and these images .
Most of the digital photographs , but this for example is a provide of the library of the Congress , and I get into the gams of 300 megaxing .
It 's not a difference because the only thing that limits to the prestations of a system like this is the number of pixel on your screen in any moment . It 's a very ffly ffly .
This is a book , for example of data , of data not data .
This is Casa desert of Dickens . Everybody represents a check .
So , I 'll show you that it 's just about images , and you can do something like this , to see that it 's a real representation of a tonight , not a picture of a picture .
It could be a way to read a little artificial read a book book .
It 's not not about it .
This is a more realistic example . This is a number of the Last .
Every picture is the beginning of a seition .
And you really have the pleasant and the beautiful experience of the paper of a review of a review or a quotidian , or a quotidian , which is for nature of a mold of a half .
We also have something with the angle of this particular number of the Last Lodian .
We have a badvertional advertional advertional , which is more than that you use in a normal advert -- and we put you in the content .
If you want to see the carlall of this car , you can see here .
Or other models , or even the specific specific techniques .
And this really demonstrates some of these ideas to eliminate the limits of space .
We hope this means that we put the end to a few p-up , and other porcheries , you don 't have to be necessary .
Of course , the map is one of the most obvious to this kind of technology .
And on this one I don 't want to lose , if we don 't tell you that we have contribute to give this field .
These are all the streets in the United States , you 're all the stretch of the NASA .
So , we 're going to go to something else .
This is actually actually from the vial on the web ; you can go to see .
It 's a project called Photosynth , which combine two different technologies .
One is Seadragon and the other is a very interesting computer , in the world 's very interesting to do for the the world of Washington , a student of the University of Washington , with the aid of UW and Rick Seitz Rick Szelisi of Microsoft Research . " At the Research . "
And it 's from the wider , I managon to Seadragon .
You can see it when we do this kind of screens , where we can go from a picture of the other and have this kind of experience to solution multiple .
But the spacecual collocation of images here has actually a meaning .
The algorithms of visualization , they have been registrated these images together , so that you can see the places -- all of the argu-- all of the way , you can imagine -- all slagne Rococcurs -- you 're slegs -- you 're sweet .
I don 't know if I have time to show you some other environment .
And I 'm some of the most space .
I want to go directly to one of the original data of Noah-- and this protected from a precedent prototypes that we did for the first time , to show you what the first time to show you what it is really the chieved thing that we have to be the key to deal with this technology , Photosynthosynth that we 've been looking at the website .
We had to prerest to be worry and forth .
This is a reconstruction of Noter 's press of Noter , Bast digm . Bast digital , and you get to Notre Dame and you get kinds of images of these things in magician , and you 're saying . Ogning one of these coni arts and to this model .
So , I 'm all pictures of Flickr and you 're all connected to this way .
And it 's possible to be able to be able to be very simply .
You know , I would never have to end work to work for Microsoft .
It 's very gratififer , I get this kind of account here .
I think you can see that it 's a lot of different fotoss of fotoss , and those of the phones to those professional professional , a number of meaning , put together in this environment .
And if you can , I try to try to look at those more strange .
So , you 're blown up , etc .
So , somewhere here , you find a series of photographs -- it .
This is a poster of Noter registrate Dame registrated .
We can go from the poster to the physically of this environment .
The essential point is that we can do things with social environment . This is now taking data from the whole memory -- from the internal memory of how to look at the land , from the point of visual , and all those data together .
All those pictures become together , more than the sum of the parts of the parts of the parts .
You have a model of the internal model .
Think of this like to the prolungment of Stephen Lawler on Earth .
It 's something that grow in complexity , as people use , and the wantages of the people are using it .
They 're mart with metaded metaded by other people .
If you get the idea of to contrassigning all these things , you know , my picture of the name of a catchtedral of Noter , you can use to be able to use them to use as a point of expensive , and I can use as a point , and I can use it as a kind of source and a social experience of any other experience , and you have a social experience of a kind of smo-mo-out of source and to use .
Of course , a consequence of everything , they 're extremely elaborated , and you 're very interesting to the land , you can 't go to you see and images and images and images and images and similar images , but from the memory .
Mille thank you .
Chris Anderson : I understand ? What your software you 're going to do is that , you know , in the next years , all of the next few years , all the photographs , all the photographs will be able to interior going to be practically connected together ?
BAA : Yeah . What 's doing it is doing it .
It 's creating hyperlink , if you want , you to go , between images .
And it 's doing it in the contail of images .
The thing is become very interesting if you think about the several information of semanties that many of these images are going to be .
As you have a research research on the web , you digm a phrase and the text on the page of the web has a lot of information about images .
Now , what happens if that picture you can all all your picture ?
So the amount of interconnection and the amount of rchemistry and the amount of rchemistry that is really huge .
CA : Blaise , it 's really amazing . So , you 're very amazing .
BAA : I 'll thank you very .
One of the major of the wild , and one of the search of search is the order of the ants that you can live in in who has no deal , between who who are in the wind , you have the past in the wind , you get it into the wind , you 're going to be fly in the wind , you wild .
Basti think of the monkeys Jaguar vision , or that the wild of the Lattea , or that the wild of the people of the people , or that in Himalaya , they 're still collied , the buddists still the respier of Dolma , to remember the way , and the world that the world 's way we live in the world , but it 's just a lot of reality , but it 's just a model of reality ,
consequence of a particular set of choices that our stypes has done , well , very bad , many generations ago .
And , of course , we all share the trust .
We all all of them . We all try .
We 're subjects to start .
We have to deal to death the inesorability of death , so we don 't sell it --
all of a art .
What you want to cold is the particular of the song , the riting of every culture .
It 's not the people who are the Penan ange of the Borneo , or the Woman Haiti , or the wooodoo Haiti , or Kaisst in Kaiss-up , Curander , Curander 's Curander , or a swear in the heart of Sahara .
And he was my company , my journey in the desert of a month ago , or a high high school , in the Everest , the Everest , the dead of the world .
All these people are teaching us that are other ways of existing , and other ways of thinking , other ways of move in the world .
And if you 're a moment , you can give you a bad concept that can give you hope .
And then , the myries of cultures of the world creating a ragnote of life life , and it 's important to the planet , and it 's important for the well-being of the planet as the well-being like biosphere .
And you can think about this ragnotion as a cultural , as a hetnosphere and you can call the extra sum of all the concepts of all the concepts , and ideas , inspirations , inspirations , intuitions , intuitions ,
The etnosphere is the fantastic paper of humanity .
It 's the symbox of what we 're and what we can be in how inquisitive .
And because the biosphere was a big , it was a very , unununfortunately , and it was very quickly , and it 's very quickly .
In a biologist , for example , it would say that 50 percent of all the species was or the exintion of the exintion of the exintion of the exintion of the biological diversity -- in the field of biological diversity -- and you don 't have to be able to be able to neighborhohood -- that diversity .
And it 's all about this is , of course , the perdent language .
When you 're born in 6,000 language on this planet .
One language is not only to a vocabolary or a series of rules or a series of rules .
One language is a human spirit .
It 's the middle of the animal , which the animal of every culture comes in the material .
Every language is a forest of mind , a backin , a winner , a way of the spiritual possibilities .
And of those 6,000 language , as we 're in the Monterey , at least the half the horecchie , they 're going to be ssurrounds .
They 're not teaching kids , the kids , the people who want to say , to less than that , you 're already death .
What is there more tried to be able to be able to be able to talk about a language , of the last talk about a language , of not not to get the saggeon of the several of the children ?
This is a few of the world of some of the world every two weeks , and a few weeks , a few weeks , and a door and door with sis in the tomas .
And I know someone of you will say , " Do you don 't have it better ?
The world would not be a better place if you 're going to talk about the same language ? " Benissim , then we 're talking to all yoruba .
We 're going to talk about kogs .
You 'll see a tract thing thing means that you can 't talk to your language .
I 'd like to do a journey through the etnosphere --
a little journey in the etnosphere to give you a source of what we 're losing .
Many of us deal that when I say , " different ways of existing , " I 'm going to be different ways of exist .
We take for example , this bimbo Barasana , in Amazonia , the popular of the anacond of anacond , which cret the myth of latest in the pants of sacond in the pants of sacond of sacond .
It 's a popular that it 's not able to distinguing the blue color of the verde because the time you 're identified in the forest , where the people are the popular .
They have a strange language and a matrimonial , he said , " You have to you to have a different person who talked about a different person who talks about a different language .
All of this has been in the past mitologist , in the past mitologist , it 's in these families , and they 're talking to six or seven language .
They 're limited to listen and then start talking to .
We take one of the most interestingly in the most interested in which I lived , the Waorans of Ecuador nural , a incredible people who had the first contact in 1958 .
In 1957 , five missionary , they have a cont cont cont a made of a supply .
They were going to get out of the photographs that they were revered to come out of the degrees , degrees that this popular of the forest .
They collect the picture of the land , they were the research , and they were going to be a shape or a shape and , I 'm not going to come to the diable , and they killed the five missionary , with the lance .
But the Waorans don 't kan the strange .
They killed to them .
54 percent of the mortality was caused by their same .
We 're sitting up to eight generations and we found two of death , and when we were death to know , they were inveced that one of them was invectually invecting , and then they killed the same .
The cruers were able to recognized the animal to 40 step and recognized the species .
In the first ' 80s , I was assigned a really interesting compask when my professor , I 'm going to go to Haiti to go to Haiti to Haiti to go to Haiti to go to Haiti to the major of Duvalier and Tonton Macocool , and I 'm going to make the vehhict for me of the veils .
To give a sense of mirrerous , I would have to understand the culture Vodoo , and that Vodoo is not magnine .
It 's pretty much about a complex view of the world .
So , a lot of interesting .
If I ask you to tell me the big religions of the world , what would you say ?
Cristianesimum , Islam , Buddism , Ebraism , and it was , etc .
A continent is always left out , I think the sub-Saharan , no people don 't have any other religious . And instead is not the other that the distild of these religious concepts of these religious concepts in the slavic tragic ,
What makes the interesting voodoo is the intended between life and death .
So the vision of the spirits .
The spirites can be invoced by the Grande Aqua , they 're going to come to the dance of the dance and they have been time to the sought of the vious , in a short , the following the following .
So , for this voodoers , you know , you 're going to talk to God .
We say , " We 're going to deep and dead God . "
And from the moment you 're you 're sitting , is the spirit that you , how you can you do it ?
So you 're going to have these incredible events : follow voodoor in the state of trance , you 're going to be able to be able to be a rather force of the power of mind when it 's catalized in a state of extraordinary extraordinary , but exciting .
And all the people who lived the most extraordinary of the most extraordinary of the Sierra Nevada Santa Marta , in Colombia , in Colombia .
They were of the vantical civic civic civic civic , they were living on planned , the world 's popular , the people were the people , the people were sitting on the sesevere , the sunch of sleep that you 're on plants .
In a snine of blood , this popular , this popular , it has never been conflict to the drug .
And so , there are governed by a clero , but their formation is really extraordinary .
The young people following come from from families , three or four years , and they live in a world of good , and they live in a world of good , and they 're going to be able to hold the bottom of the glacier for 18 years .
Two ddenods of nine years of the propost for the nother months of the managing of the mother , now are metaphorically in the the uter of the Grance Mfather .
So , you 're going to acculturate values of their society , values that predict that their pregnant , and only their preyer to be the equilibriecological -- or to say the equilibriegical .
In the term of this incredible , they 're improved out and for the first time in their life , at the age of 18 years , you see a moment of the first time , you see a sun of the first ball , when the sun sun , when the sun sun is sun , and it 's a fly , all that they 've learned in the whole splendor . The pret of the fer . The pret refect . The pret of the first time , and he 's going to go back and say ,
" I 'm going to ? Propriprise as I said .
It 's study . Now , it 's a protect . "
They call it greators and say that we , the fastern , we are the cold of the world .
This is extremely important .
When we think about the wild , and the old environmental environment , and the old story of the old old old , which is a concept in the simplicity in its simplicity in his simplicity in the simplicity of the neighborhood and say that these people are close to the Earth of us .
The wouldn 't be born 't feeling .
There 's no space for these things in the palua or of the Aststore in the Tibet , but thank you to go , and I got a time and I got a mystical sweapons of the nearards , but on a well-neards , but on a wintuition of human .
What does it mean ?
And that 's going to say that a girl of the Ande that grow up , it 's a spirit of Apu that will be a human being a human being , and it will be a human being , and will be different to have a human respect with the mountain of the mountain of the Montana that growth that grows a mountain of rock , and it 's a sleaved mountain of rocce of rocks to be a sell of rock of rocks to be a sell of rock of rocce .
Which is the dimour of a spirit or a mineral was a mineral .
What 's interesting is the metaphor that defines the export between the individual and the natural world .
I grow up in the forests of Columbia British cret , they were growing up to be table .
And this reso a human being different from my friends , Kwakiutl that believe that the forests are the forests of Hukukuk and the wild of the paradise and the spirits that are going to live in the world , the spirits that will be in the beginning of the Hams .
If you start to look at that these cultures , you can start to buy some different things , you can start to buy some sense of their feeling .
I 've been taken this picture to open in the Western Amazonia .
Mayan some of you have heard about the ayahusion , the most powerful psycotively ssue .
What makes you like this , the ayahusion is not the potential to make it chologist of the place , but his elaboration . It 's composal by two elements .
So , a side , this lian launch of a series of carboline , harm and harm , light-sleep , ladies .
To take the only plants , you have a smoke , which altera little bit the consciousness , but it 's a little bit of the family of coffee Psychots said Psychots said Psychots .
This plants of the tripptamine , very similar to the serotonin , dimethyptamine-5 , methyptamine .
If you 'll ever see Yanomami , you 'll be able to see the bird of the stance that they do from a different species , and it contains .
And then that polar that is a little bit like to be parked by a sleep , and you can get up on a sleep of dipink and land on a sea of electricity . [ Rinate . It 's not creates a destaursion of realm .
I wanted to be often with my professor , Richard Evan Shultes , the man who had been schedelic , with his discovery , with his discovery of the fungi of the fungi of the fungi in the 1930 in Mexico .
I 'm my tesis , you can 't classified these trippamine as as you 're not going to tell anybody to be hallucinated . And they 're not going to be slegs . They can 't be sunds to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be natural in the wild , he 's worth , and it 's a slegs .
It 's possible to be able to be able to be able to sunds with other chemicals that dens , you know , the MAO .
Now , it 's the beautiful : the carboline that are in this light-carboline , of the same same same necessary to potential sorts of the same same needs to potential . The question question of sample , in a flour , like these people are in the sample of plants , like these people are in this way , but if you combints in this way , you think if you combinate a version of biochemical version that is the neighborhochemical version of the sus of the sm of the sum of the sum of the sum of the ss of the sus of the sus of the sus of the sm of the ss of the sm , but the sity of the same same same same same
We use the great eufemissing of prove and the mistaining and the mistainfruttifer .
But if we 're going to say , " The raft , you 'll tell you " The pist .
What does it mean ?
This tribes , the Cofan , has 17 variety of ayahuash , which are nice in the forest , and you can get into the same species .
If you ask how to stbilit their tasonomy will tell us , " I thought I was going to understand the piant , of the rest , I said , " No . "
The solution is : you take the 17 variety of a sleep , and each of a piena and each other .
So , you don 't read to Harvard , but it 's much more interesting that content the stami .
Now , [ [ applausi ] the problem is that even those of us have been cuor the people find their own own own own own own own own own own , and they 're going to margins , and I 'm going to go back to our real world , and pass .
In fact , the X-century , between 300 years , it doesn 't have to be able to his innovation , but rather as the world , rather as the world , and we had to stop and used and absolutely accepted or accepted to the destroy-to-to-based , it is not the change .
All the cultures , through the sees are involved in a new new chance of life .
And the problem is not the technology .
The Indians Sioux , they don 't have been to be Sioux when they put up in the American and freceived so as American American American American American , when they put in the hore and calve .
It 's not the change or technology that they 're minding the power of the etnosphere .
The during the domination of domination .
And if you go to the world , I 'll find that these are not cultures of these are not destinated to be disappeared .
They 're living and dynamics , I 'm living living on the existence of identify , they 'll go beyond their ability to adaptation .
I know that it 's sboscrees in the paper of Penan --
a popular note , in Sarawak , in the sought , a popular , a popular , and now redot to a generation , and now redot to a generation , and now redot to the destitution of fies , where you can see the fighter of the sought to the wish of Borneo to Merese Meridian , where the land-Cinese Meridional Meranese , where the land-Cinese ,
You 're going to take the wood with the dream of the dream .
Or , in Yanomami , are the disease that are the disease that are coming with the discovery of the gold .
If you 're going to move on the mountain of Tibet , where I 'm doing a lot of research , you 'll see the hard of political domination .
As you 'll know the genocide , the physical expensive of a popular , but the destroyle , the destroyle of life , not just is not just not just is not just a popular , but it 's not just not just to be able , but add celebrate in certs , because it 's part of the development of .
And you can 't understand the suffering of Tibet until you 're part of the beginning .
I 've been very high school in Chengdu in China in China through the Tibet , I came to Lhasa with a young , I came to Lhasa young colleagagague , but just come to Lhasa , I understand what we feel about .
6,000 monuments redots in pols and cencourt .
1.2 million people killed by military , during the Cultural ,
The father of this guy was ascritical at the Panchen Lama .
Which means that it was killed to temple to the temple of the invasion of the Chinese invasion .
Hey is , I 'm going to Santity , during the diaspora that took the popular in Nepal .
Spean mother was been imprigioned and his cold was rich .
It was taken by hidden to the age of two years , hidden , you could not live under his wild because it couldn 't live without him .
The source , that has been mitted in the reeducated .
A day has inversion of a day , I 'm going to get a wrote of Mao and , for this transgression , was mitted to the journ-year-old .
The pain of Tibet can be indeed , but it 's the spirit of the popular of the popular .
And then , all of the end , all of a choice choice .
We want to live in the world world world 's going to be able to be able to account the world policy ?
The big anthropologies , first of dead , before he died her bigger was that , in our own own own own own lives to this view of the world , we don 't see the interest of human imagination , we 're going to see the whole guns of human thinking , but a day , you know , but a day , a day to look at the way that there were other possibly possibly possibly possibly possibilities .
And it 's ubillion to remember that our species is existed for 60,000 years .
The Rivolution Neolitc , who gave us the agriculture , who has been fight us to fight the seme of the seme of the seme of the slegs of the sleep , creating the rich of specialization , and we 're talking about 10,000 years ago .
modern world industry has been been stent 300 years .
That squallies that we don 't suggested that we have the answers to all the challenges that we 're going to get into the millennia .
When to these myries of cultures of the world is asked what human , they want to say , they 're going to be humans .
And it 's in these answers we all rised the possibilities of being what we are : a conscious species , which has to make all the people and all the gives . And there are great moments of optimissing . And there are great moments of optimism .
I 've been taken this picture on the extremely north of Baffin , when I went to the whales of the whales of the whales , and this man , and this man , and he told me me , and he told me me me , and this man .
The government had no long-term government has not always been sent with the Inuit and in the ' 50s to stopped our our supremimiles , we can thank them in colonies .
The grandfather of this man , I 'm going to go to .
The family , I 'm going to take all the time , and he took all the ards , and all his attle .
You know , you know , the Inuit doesn 't have the freeze , they 're going to be .
The pattins of slees were made of fish were made of sweight .
The grandfather of this man had not been been intimistic or from the library , or from the library , or from the library .

It has spring on the points of this coltelem , and when they came up , and when they come up , she was killed a dog .
It has been source to a brillighter , with the cast of the actic , he had imbrillighter , he was a sleg on the band , he 's sleep on the blind ,
We want to talk about caving with nothing ? [ Rate , and this , in different ways , [ Applausi , and it 's the symbest of the resilience of the world .
In the 1999 , 1999 , the government redied to the Inuit , the South the whole control of an area of territorer , and the Texas a big of the California and Texas a mitted together .
It 's their new paper . It 's called Nunavut .
It 's a independent territory . They 're all the resource .
One of the one of the like a national national , you can recognized with his popular .
And , to finish , I think it 's pretty obvious at least than you have been in these remote of the planet , and then you 're not going to be able to remote .
For someone is home .
They 're going to be able to the human imagination that are rising to the time . And for all of us , the dreams of these children , like the dreams , they become part of our children , become part of hope .
In the finish , we know , of National Geographic , we 're not going to go to nothing .
We believe that the polemies --
[ [ Applausi ] they 're not persuahead , but we think that the stories can change the world , and maybe we 're the best institution to tell the stories of the world . EEverymonth of 35 million lived .
156 countries , they 're going to get our television .
We 're going to be lette by millions of people .
Our work is to travel in the herself to bring our audience in places of wonderful cultural places from which will go through the way they have to go through and , you hope , abbraced , and they will be a central reveal in the diversity of the diversity of the diversity of the diversity , and we have to find a life in the world , and we have to find a life in a pluralth of life in a world , and we have to find a life in a world of life in the world of life in the world ,
So the saggeon of all the people contribute to our benefit .
Thank you .
I 'm going to talk about some things that I wrote in this book that I hope you 've already heard and proverted to you , in the case , you 're not going to be able to tell them .
I want to start with what I call the dogma dogma . "
The dogma of what ?
The dogma of all the company of all the society , the Western official , " If you want to massive well-being of our citizens of our citizens , " The way to do it is a different different different freedom . "
And the reason , from a side , in the fact that the liberty is in the same value , it 's useful , it 's useful , essential to humans .
And the other is that if we 're libers , every one of us can act to do everything to do everything that is that the massive of our well-being , no one who decided to name our .
The way to massive freedom is massive to choice the choice of choice .
More choices people , more are , they are more libs , and the greater is their well-being .
This , I think , it 's so deeply roadicated in the society that nobody would to put it into the society .
And it 's also deeply roed in our lives .
I 'm going to show you some examples of what progress has made it possible .
This is my super--market . It 's not particularly big .
I loved a simple note on the condition of the inforce .
In my super---condition condition , and I can 't count 10 variety of the olive , and 12 acetes , 12 acetes that you can buy for you to make a huge number of condition , in the windcircustance that nobody of 175 , you 're already going to be your degrees of 175 to be able to your degrees .
Here 's the super--market .
And then you go to the negod of electronic electronic , you know , the CD , radio , piac , you , you get the pian hold .
And in this single negogod of electronic , there 's a great number of components .
We can make six million different combinations of different using the components that there are in a snice .
You have to admit that there is a lot of choice .
Spppes : the world of communications .
And once , when I was a child , you could get all the services services , to pat the wish of the Bell .
It was a phone , they didn 't buy it was to buy it .
One of this consequence of this , the other , it was that the phone .
These days are going to go .
We have a various various of telephones , especially between the phones .
Here 's the cell phone of the future .
My favorite is in the middle , I cut up , and I can brought the bird , and the fort for the brand for the bruleld bruleless .
If you don 't have the negotten under the snice , you 're going to be going to come .
And what the end happens is that people are going to go into the negots and this question and you know what the answer ? The answer is " No . "
It 's not possible to buy a cell phone that you don 't have a cell phone .
So , in other aspects of life that are much more important of the purpose of the purpose of the purpose of choices .
Axxist : it doesn 't happen to the United States that you go from the doctor and the doctor you have to do .
And , you know , you know , you know , and the doctor says , " OK , you could do A , or B , " A has these benefits and these well-s-up , and these well-up , and these source . What you want ? "
You know , " Dottore , what I would you have to do ? "
And the doctor says , " A has these benefits and these sets , and B has these wells and B has these answers . "
" What you want to do ? "
And you rebits , " Dottore if she was , what would you do ? "
And the doctor , " But I 'm not . "
The result of the result of the maled , " autonomous , " expression that makes it look like a beautiful thing .
But it 's not that one to move the fish and responsibility to take decisions to make decisions from somebody who knows something , you know , you know , you know , or another one of course , and it doesn 't know , and so much of course , and so not in the ideal condition to take decisions .
There 's a huge marketing of products , you can 't buy , you know , you know , if you think if you think no sense , you can 't buy them , because you can 't buy them .
But if we don 't understand them , because they have to be able to be able to buy them ?
The answer is that they want to doctor , we call the doctor to ask the rect of us to change the rich .
And so , what 's so fundamental as our identity is a question of choice , as you see and in this vignant , " We don 't want to force the kids . They 're going to be able to the right time , " We don 't need to invest .
And we can reinvented us many times , we can make it .
Which means that every morning , you have to say that kind of person want to be .
I 'm going to spect the family and the matrimony , a time , it was almost to anybody , it was that there was a little bit of the soon possible , and it began to make the most price , and it began to make the fest possible .
The only versible was with who , not when , and it 's not what to do after .
And I 'm all going to play .
I 'm going to start very intelligence , and I do 20 percent of the work of the time .
And it 's not because they 're just just just just like diligent .
But I 'm just sure I 'm going to ask , " I would you to do it or not ? I would you have to do it ? "
" Do I would you to think I 've been going to think before I 'm going to go to the career ? "
I 'm interrogatives .
And they try to answer these questions , even if this implation doesn 't get the companies that asn 't get a good vote and I don 't get a good vote to my exam .
And they have to do this . I 'm important questions .
Now , the work : We 're lucky , like Carl , because the technology allows us to work every day , every day , from every day , from every day , and every day , and the Hotel Randph .
And I 'm going to go , there is a angerous angerous , and I don 't tell anybody where the WiFi works .
I don 't tell you , because I want to use it .
What does this amazing liberty of choice that we have about work ? It 's that we have to keep , continually , if we have to work or not .
We can go to see our son play cell , with the cell phone in a cell phone , the Blackberry in the other , and the notebook , and the notebook , and the notebook ,
And even though I 'm all spent , every minute we see our son , we 're also going to answer this ? "
" I wanted to answer this ? I had to answer this literally ? "
And even when the answer is , " no , all this makes the experience of your children , very different than you 'd be in other conditions .
So , you know , you 're looking at , little things and big , objects and life , life is a question of choice .
And one time the world was this : Of , there were some possibilities , but it wasn 't a question of choice .
The world of today , the world 's the dealth is , " It 's a positive thing , or negative ? "
The answer is Sef .
The positioned positive them , so I 'm going to talk about the negatives .
All this choice choice : All of two of the negatives on people .
The first , paradoxally , it 's that produced paradoxted .
And so many options of the things that you get to do it .
I offer an example : a study of a condot , I 'm going to be a foundly .
A my colleagagaged to the data of the Vand , the Janugantic society , with about a billion clients in 2,000 different companies .
What she discovered is that for every 10 solutions that are offered in the most , the percentual percentage of two percent .
With 50 source , there is 10 percent in less than adesions than they 're available to when they 're available to five . Why ?
Because 50 source of the whose you get , it 's hard to decide , and the choice is remaining to the inmorrow .
And to tomorrow , and again , and again , and of course , and of course , and of course , and we never get .
And you don 't mean that only these work from old old old , they 're going to be able to say that the decision is so much money , it 's so ostyy-in-source , they also want to say that the decision is that allowed the danger of work .
I don 't talk about , they 're losing until five dollars to five dollars to the dator of work , which would be brought to be able to be able to be able to be .
So the paralive is a consequence of having a consequence of choices .
And I think it makes the world .
" And to end , to end , for the keternity : keternity or maionese ? "
You 're just going to take the decision of just , if it 's the eternity , right ?
You don 't want to choose the wrong wrong , and you know , the condition of the wrong condition .
So this is the first effect . The second is that we can also have to evookay , and we do a choice , at the end of how we were going to be able to be able to be with less options to be able to be able to less options .
And this for different reasons .
One of these is that with many of these are , with many condition , if you buy a and not perfect , and it 's not perfect , it 's easy to imagine that you could have a different choice that would be better . And what 's going on is that alternative to be able to be better . And the replaced of choice , and the replaced of the present of the choice of the decision of the decision of the decision of the decision of the reachce of the present ,
And even when it was a good decision .
So , you choice , there are , more is easy to have any detail that it is unsubsional of the option of opping option .
So , there 's what economists call call it expensive expensive opportunity .
Dan Gilbert has asked very well , as the value that we 're going to depend things that we 're going to depend on what we 're going to depend on .
So , when you 're in the way , when there are lots of options , it 's easy to represent the character of the alternative , and it 's less subsisit .
Here 's a example . I don 't know , I 'm a lot of New York .
But it 's what you would think .
There 's this pair from Hamptons .
A place of lussian place .
It 's sleaved . Ottma . It 's all of them .
And it 's not missing . But what he thought is , " Well , it 's Agosia . "
" All my neighborhood , I 'm going to Manhattan . "
" I could talk to go to just just right to go to home . "
And I 'm going to go to two weeks , you 're losing -- every day -- every day -- the possibillions of park where you want .
The opportunity to deminds the subsit of what we have , when the choice was , when the choice was excellent .
And the most of the options that we have to look , more the characteristic characteristic character .
Here 's another example .
This is telling us a lot of things .
It 's talking about living time , and maybe in living lentered .
But the most important point is that you choice , you wouldn 't do the other .
The things that we don 't have to be able to attractive , that we can make less attractive what we do .
So , third point : It 's going to be growing of expected .
I tried on my skin buying a couple of jeans .
I 'm almost always jeans .
And once the jeans were just a kind of , buy and they were to besty , they were discovered , just after I had to go well , just after you have a lot of times , they were starting to go well .
So , I went to buy a couple of old when the old old were gone , and I said , " I need a couple jeans , this is my cut . "
And he said , " Look wants to do it , and it 's going to be , and fit ? "
And I want to want to take the bottons ? " Stonebottons ? " I 'm going to be ? "
" Look wants ? "
" Sotto take them to the rot ? Bil bbbil -- " Continured to elenhot .
I was swhord , and after a little bit , and I could say , " I want to say , " I want to be the one of the negogotten , so for a few of jeans , and then you use , and then you use , and I used by the negogos , and I had never been .
It was the massive . I had the choice . I had the best .
But I feel worse .
Why ? I wrote a whole book to understand it .
And the reason I was worse is that I was worse with all that choice was altime , the jeans had to be perfect .
I was expected to expected me . I didn 't expected any excited when I was only one of the same thing , but when you live 100 different , accidents , at least a kind of like to be perfect .
What I had to buy , but it wasn 't perfect .
After I had to have paragoned what I was trying to do with what I was trying to expected to expected .
And it 's add options in life , not to get the expectations that these have respect to the excellence of the options .
And this will be going to be less subddisfation , even when the results are good .
None in the marketing of the marketing , if you 're realized .
Because if they knew , you 're not knowledge to talk about .
The truth of the most to this .
" You were better when it was worse when it was worse when it was worse when it was worse when you was worse was worse to met of the resolds .
Ose , the world we live -- opulents , industry , industry , industry , industry with the massive , the massive of the perperspective , which we can hope is that things to the althematics .
You don 't have surprised because your expected expected , because your expected expected , I 'm ungantical .
The secret of happiness -- you 're here -- it 's : " Bash , " Well , you want . "
I mean , I 'm going to say -- I 'm really sposed and my wife is really study and my wife is really study .
I couldn 't do better , I couldn 't do , I 'm not going to do , I 'm not going to do .
But it 's not always a good thing .
And finally , a consequence of buy a couple of jeans discovered when there is just that kind of jeans is that when you 're not going to ask , " Why ? " Why ? " Why ? "
" Who is responsible ? " " " , the answer is clean .
The world is the responsible . What could you do you do ?
When you 're hundreds of kinds of jeans , and you buy a baby , and you ask you who are responsible , and you ask the responsible , you 're going to be responsible you .
You could do better .
With hundreds of various various , there are no insuccessful .
So , when people take decisions , even if the result is wild , you feel like , and they 're going to be able to come .
In the last years , the depression is explose in the industry of the industry of the industry .
I think a few meaning -- not the only one , but important -- of this ond of depression is that people have experiences because the standard are too too high .
And when they have to explain this situation that the colst of them .
So the final result is that we 're better , objectively , but we feel worse .
Let me remember .
This is the dogma of the official dogma , what we 're going to buy and it 's completely fleep .
There 's no doubt that a little bit better choice that I don 't have to be able to do this , it doesn 't actually have a little bit better than a little bit better than a little bit .
There 's a critical value , magic . I don 't know what it is .
But I 'm sure that we have been super-piece of the level of the price , which are the best choices to our life .
Now , from political view -- I 've been on the political , I 'm just from the way , the nocction is the followed .
What allows this all of the industrial , it 's the rchemistry .
There are many places in the world , and you know , you know , where the problem is not that they have been so many choice .
The problem is that they have too too few .
So the thing I 'm talking about is a maling malist of modern modern , requires that society are a Western society .
And what it does depress and arrheat is this : Steve Levitt , Steve , you have talked about how those expensive and discover ways of those things are inuseful .
I mean these choices , complicated and you have to say , it 's not that they 're inutions .
I 'm add deleterie .
They 're worse .
If a little bit of what in our society , you know , you know , you know , the people have too too few chance , it would not only have their life to improve but also our own life .
This is what the economists call a mistaining a little pareth .
A redistribution of the redistribution of all -- not only to poverty -- because of this choice in except that you can get up .
So , I 'm going to end , you can be everything you want to be , "
You , you know , people are you think , " But what it makes that fish ? "
It 's obvious that you can 't make anything in a boct of wind . "
" A imagination of castrated , a limited view of the world --
And I 'm going to interpretated so , at the beginning .
But then , I think , instead , instead , I 'm realized that what it 's going to be .
Because the reality of fact , it 's that if you 're in frantums , so that , " everything is possible , you can 't get the freedom .
If you 're going to get the box in a way that all deminute , you can be able to deminute .
And you 're excited to go , and you 're going to reduced the well-being .
All they need a sphere .
This is almost certainly too , too , maybe even to the fish , and you know , and sure for us .
But it 's a few symbolic symolic smart is a recipe for infants .
Thank you of heart .
