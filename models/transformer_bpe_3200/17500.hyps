Last year I showed these slides to show that the glacial calotta , which is about three million years has had the size of the 48 , in the continental , is about 40 percent .
But this subvalley the gravity of the problem because it doesn 't show the spent of the problem because it doesn 't show the spent the path .
The artical calotta is , in a sense , the clean , the clean of global climate system .
You expanies .
The next slide will be a rapid carrelated to the advent of the last 25 years .
The glaces have been signed in red .
As you see , you expand it up to the blue scall .
That 's the ice in the winter , which is ritizen .
You can see that cosidged the pice , of five years or more , is like blood , which is as blood , which is as a blood , which was in the body .
In 25 years , it 's so ,
This is a problem because the heat in the heavior glaciated around the arctic ocean where there are huge carbon where there are huge carbon of carbon congle , come out of the microbes .
I 'm going to take the totality of the atmospherical reming , that amount could double , super-scale , super-scale .
In some of the laghi , in Alaska is already rebolling on the water .
The professor Katey Walter in the University of Alaska was a team in a blow last last invertis-winter .
Video : Wow ! Al Gore : I 'm going to be good .
One reason is that this termal re-scale scratators the Groenland from the northern North .
This is a glacial river .
The landed had never reached to levels .
This is the Kangerlussua-the-west of Groenland .
If you want to know how to be the sea for the pace of the glaces on the ground , here is where the sea .
These currently currently .
Another side of the planet : Antartide , the largest block of the planet .
The month of the scientists have died that the bill of ice is in negative , and that the Antargative Antnegative , which pogen on some islands , is particularly fast in the leaves .
It 's six to six feet feet of the acque , like Groenland .
Sulla Himalaya , the biggest third of ice , you see new laghi , which is a few years ago .
40 percent of the world population half of the world 's population half of the pounds that the protection .
Sulle Ande : this glacier is the source of the pounds of this city .
The luck is increased .
But when you diminues , the same happens to the potax water .
In California , the newspaper in Sierra Nevada is 40 percent .
The idrices are in crisis .
The predictions , as you read , they 're very good .
The growing ss in the world leads to a remarkable remarkable .
The environmental disasters are increasing a rim outside of the normal and without previous .
Four times more numbers in the last 30 years , which is 75 .
This is a whole unsustainable .
If you look at the context of the historic if you can see the consequences .
In the last five years we added 70 million tons of CO2 every 24 hours -- 25 million tons in the ocean every day .
Look at the area of the oriental Pacific , from the American , to the west , and in the west part of the indeed , where there is a radical imor of oxygen in the ocean .
The major causes of global warming , together to deforestation , which is 20 percent , is the fossil use of fossil fuel .
Of course , it 's a little bit worse .
The United States is one of two countries with more emissions , together to China .
And you would try to build many other carbon carbon carbon .
But we 're seeing a direction of a direction .
These are the anullated projects in the last few and some green proposes of green .
So , there 's a political lot in our country .
The carbon industry and oil have spent 250 million dollars in the last year to promoting carbon , which is a bunch .
And that 's a picture of me me something --
Verice Natal , in Tennessee , where I live , there was a 3.8 billion lights of carbon .
Maybe you 've seen the news .
This is the second largest flow in America .
It happened around Natal .
The nalization of one of the carbon industry was this .
Video : I 'm going to be a carbon is a kind of alleg and happy .
It 's abundant here in America , and growing our economy .
Frororosty carbon is more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and
It 's good price , adorable and the work , they 're going to keep the stage .
Al Gore : From here is a lot of the West Virginia .
The biggest mineral society on the mountain Coal . This is his administrator .
Video : Don Blankenship : I 'll be , Al Gore , Nancy Pelooid , Harry Reid -- they don 't know what they 're talking about .
Al Gore : So the Alleance for Protext of Clima has launched two campaign .
This is a part of them , a part .
Video : Acore : ALergy : ALergy , and we see the climate change to our business .
For our priority is investing a great amount of money in a bunch of money in a advertising , and confused the truth of carbon .
It 's actually not sporite .
We think it 's clean -- it 's also a good profum .
So , not preocupatate of climate change .
Let me do it .
Video : Carbone : Carbone -- you 've heard a lot of speak .
So let me take a turn into a structure to the avaning of the pulit of how much carbon coal .
Straordinary ! The machines are a little rumorous , but this is the sound of carbon technology .
The carbon consumption is between the main coal warming , but the remarkable technology of carbon heat that , but the remarkable technology that you see all the way .
You look at a look : this is the odiergn technology .
Al Gore : Instead , the alternative alternative to the economic issue and the national security .
Video : Comment : America is in crisis ; the economy , the security crisis .
The figes that connects all : our dependence from fossil fuel , like carbon fuel and oil oil is important .
Now , there 's a new , audace , audace solution to use it .
Repower : 100 percent of clean energy , in 10 years .
A plan to remaining to put America to work , and make us sure , and help stop the global warming .
Finally , a solution that bables solving our problems .
Repower .
Al Gore : This is the last .
Video : How about return out energy to America .
One of the faster ways to take the dependence of the combustible that kills our planet .
Comparse : The future is here . Very , a new energy network .
Nuarsa : Nuoves for the investment of ben work .
Comment : Repower America . It 's time to be realists .
Al Gore : A old proverbio African , he says , " If you want to go fast , go to fast .
If you want to go far , go together . "
We have to go far , speak , speak .
Thank you very much .
Last year at TED , I introduction in the HC .
And I promise to get update about how the machine works .
So here I was . And for the ones that you had no , the LHC is the biggest scientific experiment ever tented -- 27 kilometers of circuit .
His compask is to rereturn the conditions that were at less than a billion billion second on the universe -- until 600 million times a second .
And that 's just unambious .
This is the machine in Ginevra .
We 're going to take these min-Big Bang inside the detectors .
This is what I work . It 's called ATLAS -- is about 44 meters and has a diameter of 22 meters .
This is a spectacular picture of ATLAS in building so you can see the proportions .
Too 10 to settember last year we have the machine for the first time .
And this picture was taken by ATLAS .
It was because of immense festegators in control .
It 's an image of the first fascies that had done all the LHC , entering in collision , deliberately , with a part of the LHC , and spread particles inside the remarkable .
In other words , when we see that image 10 to settember , we realize that the machine worked , which is a great wittory .
I don 't know if it was this to make us more or this , when somebody went on on Google and vide that the initial page was this .
That means we 've had a cultural impact over the scientific impact .
About a week after , there was a problem with the car , just had to these file here -- these figrid here -- these figers .
These files are 13,000 print when the car works at the massive of the power of the power of the power .
Now , the technical between you will look at the files and say , " It 's not true . I 'm very subtle . "
And they can do it because when I 'm very cool cosiddles .
So , at least 271 degrees , to a inferior a temperature between the stars , these children can bring that running that currently .
In one of the giuntures of the most noveil in the LHC , there was a difed defect .
So the files they would be able to read , and the 13,000 practice suddenly met a electrical resistance .
This was the result .
Now , this is even more impressive if you think about that these weighs more than 20 tons , and that you 've been moved about 30 centimeters .
And they 're damage about 50 magnetes .
We had to take them , what we did .
We 've restinated and enried .
Now they 're going to get all the subland .
By the end of the LHC is going to be a new integral .
We 'll access it , and we expect to get the data to jumping or the lusters , and we keep our adventure to discover what I 'm in the morning that are the universe .
Now , of course , in a way , these accidents return the debate on the value of science and engineering in front of science and engineering in front .
I think the fact that it 's so hard , the fact that it 's so hard to be the value of things like LHHC .
I want to conclude with the words of a English scientist , Humphrey , which , imagine , in difense of unuseful , and his clello , his clello was Michael Faday , his clello . He said , " Niant is so dangerous for progress of human mind how the retain report the ideas of science are definitive to human human speak , which is not a conflict . "
Thank you .
I want to start asking you to start thinking about when , children , play with the morning .
As you can get them to get them and take them , take them and move , you 're going to get them and get them , you know , actually , and you know , you know , and you know , space relationships .
So the space reasoning is deeply connected to the way we understand a lot of the world around us .
So , from information useful of our interaction with physical objects , together to my physical consulent , and my collaborator Jeevan Kalanithi , I started to ask me , " And if we use a computer instead of having the mouse as a pollyer that 's just a computer , we could deal with a deal , we could deal with an enty entle-digm , we could deal with an entle-hand hand hand hand hand hand hand hand hand hand , we could actually deal with a computer dad ,
and how to stand our lifestimate ?
The question was so interesting that we decided to explore the answer , building Siftable .
In a few words , a Siftable , a Siftable computer as a biscoscoothing .
In a few words , a Siftable , a Siftable computer as a biscoscoothing .
You can move them with your hand , they can see , " between them , " you can see the movement and they have a screen and a wireless .
But in fact , I 'm physical objects , like the morning , you can move to be able to make them .
The Siftable is an example of a new ecosystem to manipulate information information .
And as they get more physical , you know , the other movement , of the other , and as they get more physical , and the other , of how we move them , we can explore new and different ests of interaction .
I 'll start with some simple example .
This Siftable is configured to show video : if you 're going to put it in a direction , video that will road on the other side .
These interactive rates are conscious .
If you deal with them , they 're interested in what they 're around .
If they 're circuit , they can get a little bit .
If they 're circuit , they can get a little bit .
They also have their movement and inlination .
And then we realized that one of the most implications of the interaction was able to use common management , to example , " a color like , " we 're going to take a liquid .
In this case , we three Siftable configured as a vernice and I can use them to the central color in that central , where you mix .
and I can use them to the color in that central , where you mix .
If we 're too too far , we can put it a little place .
I 'm also a beautiful chance of apprentice , like language , the mathematics and logic games where people can try things , and you see the results of it .
Now I 'm --
This is a Fibonacks that I do with a equations that I do with a equations .
Here we have a words that 's half between Scarabean and Boggle .
Pratically , at every turnal receive a literal case on every Siftable , Pratically , at every Siftable , and when you 're looking at any of your words of compories , and as you 're looking at a dictionary .
And then , after about 30 seconds of the remisses , and you have a new letters and new possibilities to try .
Thank you .
Here 's the children came to the Media Lab , I did so much how we tried them and I tried a video .
They are very liked .
And one of the interesting things that kind of appliliance of this kind of applilies .
You just say , " Compons of words , and they know exactly what do .
Here 's what other people do .
This is our young girl tester , there on the right .
It was actually wanted to impilling them .
They 're only morning in the morning , for him .
Now , this is a appliation of a interactive chart .
We wanted to build a tool for the Lui is Felix .
It can put new characters in the scene , you 're just going to Siftable .
It can put new characters in the scene , you 're just going to Siftable .
Here 's , he 's doing the sun .
Video : The sun is source .
David Merrill : Now , she brought a hold hold in the scene .
Video : The treat atment .
Bel work !
So , you know , Siftable and put them close to interact with characters --
Video : Bau !
-- by inventing your story .
Video : Heep !
DM : It 's a very open story , and it can decide how you want to fly .
DM : It 's a very open story , and it can decide how you want to fly .
Video : Very on , that all .
DM : The last example I have time to show you is a tool , I made of recent , to campaign and exectations .
is a tool , I made of recent , to campaign and make music .
The Siftable here are the sounds like the bass , the bacteria .
Every one of these has four different variations , and you can choose to use .
You can also put these sounds in a sequence to get your lifestimate .
And you 're just doing touch a sound and a sequence . "
These are actually , you can control from the vial , like the reverber and the filter .
You attacks to a particular , and then inclens to enjoy it .
And then there are the general effects as time and fly , that they applied to the sequence .
Let 's look at how it works .
Video : We 're going to try to get a base in Siftable , " We 're going to be a series , we 're going to add other base .
Now I put a baseline .
Video : DM : I 'm going to say , "
Video : DM : And I 'll put the filter to the bacteria , so I can control the effect from the vial .
Video : DM : I can be fast the whole sequence of the time from one side or another .
Video : DM : And I 'll add the bottom of the lower to the expression .
Video : DM : I can recombine the sequence of the flight .
So I don 't have to planning , but I can improvisate , make it longer or cords .
And now , finally , I can spring the whole sequence of the Siftable to the Siftable .
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is to build new mo-for-machine acks like our brain and body work .
And today , I 've had time to show you one of this path , and some chance we try to bring out of the lab .
The concept I want to transmit is that 's coming in this new generation of design objects to interact with digital media , which will bring information in our world in the way we want .
Thank you very much .
I don 't see the hour with all of you .
I 'm a writing .
I 'm going to be books is my profession , but it 's more than that , of course .
It 's also love and the fascination of my life .
And I don 't expect that it can change .
But , I said , something particular happened in my life and in my life and in my life , which has brought me to report the entire relationship with this work .
The particular thing is that I recently written this book , this biography called " Mangia , " The which , diversity from my previous previous books , for some reason I came out in the world and became a big , bestyle , and it became a great feeling , bestyle .
And the result is that everywhere in , people treatment treatment .
It 's true -- conconvices , convict .
They 're going to be all worried and they say , " You can 't do it not to do better ?
You don 't have fear to keep writing for all of life without being able to create a book that can be able to be someone ? "
that can be a lot of somebody ? "
It 's uncertainly , you know .
But it may go worse , at the one I remember that more than 20 years ago , when I started to say , I was a writing writing -- I wanted to be a writer .
I would go to the same reaction from the fear .
And people said , " Don 't you could not do it ?
Don 't you fear that the laws of the refit killed ?
You don 't have fear to do this mestize for all of life without anything about it came out and die on a cure of dreams with the pile of the pile of failure ? "
So , you know .
The answer -- the short answer to all these questions is , " Yes . "
You know , I 'm fear of all of those things .
I 've always had fear .
And I also fear of many other things that people can 't have to inguess .
How the algae and other spent things .
But , as about how about this is , and I thought , and I would ask me , and I would say , "
Is it rational ?
It 's logical that anyone who has to be spent from a work that I felt to do .
But what 's this particular in the impress , creative , and it turns out to us about mental health care .
How my father , for example , he was a chemical engineer and not remember one time in his 40 years of activity when I was asked if you 're going to be engineer ?
There was never -- that blog of the John engineer , like that ?
Don 't work , you know ?
Onestly , the chemical engineers like group have not certainly , in the centuries , I 've been doing the reputation of being alcolized maniaces .
We writers , we have enough this reputation , and not just writers , but creatives of any kind , we have this reputation of being enormous .
And it 's not not else that you look at the triad of the magnifes of the magnifet-century dead , they die young and often died young and they die .
And the ones that you don 't have to be suiciates to be really dismade by their dones .
Nortman Mailer , before he died , in the last interview said , " My book had killed a little more " an extraordinary affermation about the work of your life .
But we don 't do that when we hear this because we heard these things so long that in a long way we 've completely interiorized and accepted the notion that creativity and suffering are in some way and suffering is in some way and suffering and that art , at the end , it will always be a few ways and that art , at the end , it will always be able to ange to the ange .
And the question I want to take all of the today is : you 're all all of the right ?
It 's good to you , because it 's just just looking at a centimeter of distance to me , it 's not good for this supposition .
I think it 's odious .
And I think it 's also dangerous and I don 't want to see the perpetuated in the next century .
I think it 's better to encourage our big creative minds .
And I surely I know that , in my case -- in my situation -- it would be very dangerous to support that I knew about support , I 'm going to give them the circumstances where I 'm in my career .
It 's very -- you look at , I 'm pretty young , I 'm pretty young , I 'm pretty young .
I 've got about four decades of work in me .
And it 's very likely that anything write about now is going to be judged by the world as the work that came out after the success of my last book .
I 'm going to be slavery , because we 're all more or not here -- it 's likely that my great success is to my behind .
Oh , Gesus , who thought !
You know , this is the kind of thought that leads a person to start to get a little bit in the morning and I don 't want to do it .
I would take this work that I love .
So , the question becomes , how ?
And so it looks like , after many reflections , that the way to work to continue to write is to create a psychological construct , OK ?
I have to find a distance of security between me , I 'm going to write , and my natural anxime that writing that writing that writing the writing that writing the time , trying to find other society to see if they could have better ideas and more healthy and more healthy and more healthy and more healthy ideas and more healthy unless healthy and more healthy un-like , and I 'm going to see if you could have the best ideas of the way I I can can get that I
how to help people in creative agrees managing the inerent emotivity .
And that research has brought me to the Greek and old Rome .
I 'm going to go to and then go back .
In the ancient Greek and ancient Rome -- people didn 't seem to believe that creativity came from men , OK ?
And it thought that creativity was this spirit , and that came to humans from a few distant source and unknown , for distant reasons and unknown , for distant reasons and unknown .
The green demand called these spirites of creativity of creativity " demons . "
Sococrate , amazing , he believed to have a elecargyzes that wisdom wisdom from far far .
The Roomes were the same idea , but they called the " inspirit species .
That 's great , because the Roands didn 't really think that a genius was somebody particularly intelligent .
They thought that a genius was this kind of divine that was living in the waste of the study of a painting , a little bit like the elpho Dobby , and that came out of the work of the areas of artist , and that came out of the areas of artist and modeling the rest of that work .
Here 's the distance of -- that 's the distance of which is the distance of which is the distance of your work .
And they all knew that it was so that it worked , right ?
So the anti-artists were protected by certain things , like , for example , too much of the way , not ?
If your work was exceptional , you couldn 't get all the rest , you can all know that the brought to this genius .
If your failed work , it wasn 't all your failed , right ?
And they all knew that it was your genius to be a inable .
And so people han conceived creativity in Occcient for a long time .
And then the Rensaving came and all this big idea ; we can put this great idea ; we put the human being in the center of the universe over all the way , and the myths that writing out of the universe and the mitizes that writing out of divinity .
This was the principle of humanth rational principles and people started thinking that creativity came from completely issues .
And for the first time in history , you start to refly this or that artist as a genius , like a genius ,
And I have to tell you , I think that was a big mistake .
I think that allows somebody , a simple person to believe that they 're like a reciple as a reciple , the essence and the source of all the mysteries , creativity , unknown as a responsibility of human physical .
It 's like to ask someone to enjoy the sun .
Deform and dead dead and destrot all these informance expanations on performance .
And I think it was this pressure that they 've been dested in 500 years .
And , if this is true , and I think that 's , the question becomes , and now ?
Can we can do that diversity ?
Maybe I 'll come back to a more comprerepreneurs of the relationship between humans and creative .
Or maybe not .
Maybe we can 't just 500 years old rational thinking in a 18 minutes .
And there 's probably people in the audience that would be reading the scientific subjects on the notion of , you know , you know , people spend up with the people are doing the next faced of their projects .
I 'm probably not going to convince you all about this thing .
But the question I want to ask is -- why not ?
Why don 't I think about this way ?
Because it 's more sense of anything that I 've ever heard to explaining the expant imprevedibility of creative process .
One process that , as anyone who ever tried to do something -- so , basically , all here -- you know , you 're not understanding .
And , in fact , it can sometimes be completely paranormous .
I did this inagainst recently in the Ruth Stone , who has now 90 years , but that 's been a few years , but he was a few few years , and he said that during his infant in the rural Virginia , and I felt it , in the camps , and I felt it , in the camps .
And he said that it was like a frageous trade .
And that was rotolating to her from her landscape .
He felt that I get , because she did so much to get the land under his feet .
He knew I had one thing to do is to do that point and was , and she was , and his words , " running like a matta . "
And so he would have to go home and come from this poem , and he wouldn 't have any other than take a piece of paper and a math of a fast and a math of a fast , and the focus on the page .
Sometimes he couldn 't be fast enough , so he would have a fast , and he would have no fast to get in home and the rotolating and she would continue to rotolate through the landscape , looking at the landscape , looking at the other poet . "
And then there were those times -- this piece of time , I 'm going to say , " " I 'll never say , OK ?
So , he was running home and she was trying to the card and the poetry was going through , and he was a matched in the way , and then said , that it was like if you go to go to the other hand and he would get it .
I coda and put it in his boundary and put it in his body and transcalculated on the page .
And in these cases , the poetry would be presented on the perfect , and the last word to the first word to the first .
So when I felt I thought -- it 's crazy , it 's exactly the same same as my creative process .
Not all my creative process -- I 'm not a construct .
I 'm a mule , and my way to work is ; you can see me at the same orarian every day and work and go over the goal and go over the gotten .
But even I , in my testing testing , I 've been striped against that thing , sometimes .
And I guess that many of you have the han made .
You know , even if the work and ideas came to me from a certain certain source you can 't honestly know .
And what is this thing ?
And how can we relate to it in a way that we don 't lose your head , but rather , rather , what do you do you get to be healthy ?
For me , the best example , the best example I have is the best example I have is the musician to Tom Waits , which I interviewed different years ago for a day .
We were talking about this , and you know , Tom , for the majority of life was the incarnation of the article , trying to control , managing these species of impults , to dominating these species of impults .
But then I 'm going to get , and I 'll just calculating a day , and a day , and he changed all for him .
It was going to be fast and all of a tract , and it 's a little framment of melodia , and it 's all the way it 's in his head as the inspiration , and you want , you to know , it 's wonderful , and the desider doesn 't know how to take it .
It 's not a piece of paper , it 's not a math , it 's not a math .
So I started to hear this species of old old old , I 'm going to go , " I 'm going to lose , and I 'm going to go and married by this song , and I 'm going to lose .
I 'm not good enough and I can 't do it . "
And instead of going to go to the panic , and he stopped .
I 'll be able to the entire mental process and made something completely new .
I just just watched the sky and said , " Scuses , I 'm not going to see that I 'm going to go ? "
" Who seem to write a song .
If you really want to exist , you 're going to get me about you .
At , you go to importunch someone else today .
I got to disturbing Leonard Cohen . "
And his process changed after this .
Not work , the work was still obvious as I always .
But the process , and the anxist that attitured was require when he was in and the genius , the genius that 's out of him , and I 'm going to get it back to where , and I 'm going to go from where , realizing that he didn 't have to be a thing that was an interiorized and remajor .
but you know , it 's a little bit of a conversation between Tom and this strange and this strange and outside that it was not Tom .
So , as I felt that story started to change a little bit even the way I worked and I was always save me .
This idea , I 'm going to save me when I was writing , Prega , Ama , " and I , and I 'm going to be a disperation where we 're working on something and we can 't start thinking about something and we can 't start thinking that it will be the worst book written .
Not just bad , right , right the book written .
And I started to think about this project .
But then I reminded me that I talked about the air and I tried .
So I came up with my face on the wall-sites and made my common to a vacuum of the room .
And I said , " See , what , you 're going to be able to be able to be a brilliant not be brilliant colate my , no ?
Because as I see I 'm going to put all of that I have , I don 't have this .
So if you want to be better , you have to introduce you and do your part .
OK . But if you don 't do that , you know what , I don 't do it .
I 'll get to write the same because it 's my work .
And I want to favor that was recorded that I 've been presented to do my part of the " Because -- at the end is so , OK -- I 'm so , OK -- centuried in the North Africa people were unrating to the close of the dancing of the moon , and music that go to the hour and the houses that went on to the hour and hours to the hand-up .
And they were always magnify , because the ballerins were fantastic and they were fantastic and they were fantastic .
But every so much , I was made , and one of these artists became actually transcendent .
And I know you know what I 'm talking about , because I know you 've all seen , at a performance so .
It was like if the time , and the ballerine , and the ballerine walked through a kind of land-up , and it was all about 1,000 notes before , but all it was all all all of them .
And suddenly , not just as a human .
But he 's accentioned from the divinity of the divinity of the divinity .
And when this next , he was , the people knew what was , they were called him .
They were the hands and I started to dog , " Allah , Allah , Allah , Allah , God , " God , " God , " God , " God , "
That 's God , you know .
Curious note -- when the More invaded the south of Spain , I was this abitude with them and the change in the centuries from " Allah , Allah , " " " Ole , " which you can still hear in the couraging or in the flamk or in the flamk .
In Spain , when a artist did something impossible and magic , " Allah , " Allah , " Allah , " incomprerensive , I was a last -- a last -- a last thing .
And that 's great because we need .
But , the problem comes the day after , the ballerine , when you go up and discover that 's 11 in the morning and I 'm going to see that 's 11 in the morning and last God is no longer .
It 's just a mortal with a mortal core , and maybe never more to get more to get to that altitude .
And maybe nobody will you go to the name of God still , and what do you have to do with the rest of his life ?
It 's hard .
This is one of the most painful recogniliations to make in a creative life .
But maybe it doesn 't have to be so angoal , if you can 't believe , and you can 't believe , and and that the most extraordinary aspects of your being from you .
But you would just believe that you 're being data in prested by an inimaginable source of this team that 's going to go to someone else when you finished .
And , you know , if we think we think in this way all changes .
And so I started thinking about , and it 's certainly how I thought about a different months in the work of the book that I 'll be going to give you , the dangerous , attesism , attesissum followed in my great success .
And what I have to keep me when I feel I feel electritried by this is , it 's not not to do .
It 's not just your work . It 's just your work .
You can get to introduce your part , any can be .
If your work is ball , you know .
If the divine , absurd genius to take you a few kind of wonderful , to let me take some kind of wonderful , for one moment through your horses , then " Ole ! "
At the same , you do the same one .
And " Ole ! " You know .
I think , I should be teaching it .
" Ole ! " You know , even , even for being human and testing tals to make a lot of tals to make you continue .
Thank you .
Thank you .
June Cohen : Ole !
As you know I 've already talked about some of these projects on the human genome , what can mean and about the discovery of new genes .
Now we 're starting a new way : we started to digitize biology and now we started to digital code , we 're going to get a new phase of biology , design and I think that 's a kind of a life .
We always tried to ask a big questions .
" What is life ? " It 's something that many biologists have tried to understand vararies .
We tried different approaches , reduced the minimds .
We 're digitizens from almost 20 years .
When we sequenced the human genome was treated to go from the analome of the world in the digital world .
Now , we ask , we can regenerate life , or create new life from this digital universe ?
This is the map of a little organism , the Mycoplasma genitalium , which is the species from the smallest genome that can authoring in the lab .
And we tried to reduce the genome to create a little bit more .
We can get to eliminate a hundred genes of about 500 that are here .
But when we look at his metabolic map , it 's relatively simple than our .
I think that 's simple .
But when we look at all the genes that we can eliminate , one at the time , it 's very unlikely that this can bring a living cells .
So we decided that the only way to progree was to synthesize this chromosome way to get to mosome of these fundamental questions .
And so we started the adventure of " Can can be able a chromosome ? "
Can you confeeling to produce these big molecules that we never have to create these big molecules that we never had to create before ?
And , in case , we can we do a chromosome ?
A chromosome is just a piece of inert material inert .
The speed with which we 're going to be growing up the life is growing riting .
Our ability to write the genetic code , instead , progret rather slowly , but it 's better .
And our most recent results the refer to a curve .
We started more than 15 years ago .
The process said , a lot of passages , starting with a biothetic revision before we started experiments .
But we discovered that synthize DNA is very difficult .
There are decines of thousands of cars in the world that make little segments of DNA , the long , of 30 to 50 letters and it 's a degenerative process : the longer longer , the error , there are .
So we had to develop a new method to make these framments and correct the mistakes .
And this is our first attempt , to partative information of the digital genome of the X 174 .
It 's a little virus that kills bacteria .
We designed the fragments , effectively effectively resters and get a molecule of DNA , and we 've got a molecule of about 5,000 lettes .
And the interesting part is when we took this piece of inert , inert , and we put it in bacteria , and we put it in bacteria , and we started to read this genetic code and viral particles .
The viral particles have then been released by cells , they 're back and come back and they 've been reported the E.
I talked to recent a membres of the oil industry , and they 're certainly understood this model .
They have more than you .
We think that 's a situation where the software can really really build its hardware in a biological system .
But we wanted to do things in big .
We wanted to build the entire chromosome of the bacteria of bacteria .
I 'm over 580 miles in the genetic code .
So we thought we made it in cassets in the size of the virus , so that we can change the cassets to understand what are the components of a living cells .
The design is crucial , and if we start with digital information in a computer , these have to be very accurate .
When we sequenced this genome for the first time in 1995 accurattaste was a mistake for every 10 mile .
We discovered , we found , 30 errors . If we used that original sequence , we would never be able to do it work .
One part of the process is design , is design a long time to make 50 lectations that are underpaying with all the other 50 lectations to build sounds of the smallest and work together .
We try to the unique elements here .
You probably have a bed that we 're going to be a great filifetime .
Think about four letters : We have a genetic code on four letters : A , C , Gs and T.
Three of those letters together with about 20 admit , and there 's a specific order to read for each other .
So we can use genetic code to write words , frasasases , thinking .
What we did in the beginning was autographed .
Some of them were delusers from the fact that it wasn 't poem .
We designed these segments to just just just a few chologists just just a lasts .
There are me that there are them and put them .
And we started assembling with the parts , start with segments from five to seven milettes , and unending the leck in a way to make a few lettle .
So , every step we made these segments in abundance so that we 're trying to get a very robustothing -- as you 're going to see in a minute .
We 're trying to authoman to authoman .
So , this looks like the tabellone of the boket .
When we get these very long , much over 100 mile , over 100 mile , the low-cost , they will not grow in the E.
It comes to the limits of modern biology of molecular biology .
So we looked at other mechanisms .
We knew about another mechanism called the omologa , which in biology , and in biology to repair the DNA to repair the DNA to repair the segments .
Here 's an example .
This organism , called Deinococcus radiodurans , can absorsorbed three million radiodurans .
You can see in the soma reward as his chromosome as his chromosome .
In 12 -- 24 hours , it 's replacement as it was before .
There are thousands of organisms that I 'm able to do it .
These organisms can take completely .
They can be below .
I 'm absolutely sure that life exist in space , and you know , places to find new rich water .
ASA showed the NASA showed that this is .
This is a picture of molecule that we built using these processes , just using the lappropriate design of the segments to insert .
The lights assemble le .
This image is not taken with a microscope , but with a microscope , but with a microscope .
It 's a molecule so we can see the tremendous microscope .
These are pictures that they 're doing a period of about six seconds .
This is the advertising that we did a little time ago .
I 'm over 580,000 letters .
It 's the largest molecule of a defined structure that man .
It has a 300 million inherate 300 million .
If you 're going to stick it with a 10 without spaces , you 'd like to 142 page to transcause this genetic code .
Now , how do we do that ? How can we activate it ?
Of course , a virus is a game from kids .
It 's a little bit more complicated when you use bacteria .
It 's simpler also when it 's about eucariote like our : you can just get the nucleo and put another , which is practically the process of cloning .
In the bacteria , the chromosome is integrated inside the cell , but we recently demonstrated that we 're able to make a complete training of a cell cell of another and active it .
We clean a chromosome , where we can make a microbial .
The two are different as humans from the topes .
We added some gene in a way that we can decide what to do is this chromosome .
And then I 'm going to kill all the protein way to kill all the protein .
And when we put it in the cells is stupendo-- and you 'll appreciate our underpace graphic graphic graphic graphic graphic graphic .
And we started thinking that we couldn 't go beyond , but we tried anymore in there .
This is one of the major mechanisms of evolution .
We discovered that a lot of species have added in a second or a third chromosome , and add gend a second , and in a second thousand tracks .
So who think about evolution as a only gene and the time you have modies not understood a lot of biology .
They 're in the enzyme called " " " " " " " " " It 's going to be a DNA DNA .
The chromosoma that was in the cells doesn 't have one .
The mobile phone is the cell phone that we inserito------cell phone .
It 's expressed , and he recognized the other crumosome as an estranean , and we 've got it all the time , and we 've got all the time with only cells and the new chromosome .
It became blue because of the genes we 've inserted .
And in a short leverage of time , all the characteristic of a species , went through a new species , based on the new software that we 've put in a new species , based on the new software that we 've inserted in cells .
All the proteins have changed , the membrane has changed , and when we read the genetic code . And when we read the genetic code .
Now , this may seem alchemy genetic , but altering the software , we can change things in a way of substantial enough .
Now , I 've already explained that 's not about genesis -- but of progress from three million years and a half million evolution , and I said that maybe we 're going to create a new version of Cambrian explosion in which will be created new species on this digital process .
Why do that ?
I think that 's enough obvious when we think about our needs .
We 're going to move from six and a half billion people in the next 40 years .
Right for an example : I was born in 1946 .
Now there are three people on the planet for each of the planet in 1946 ; in the 1946 .
We 're having problems now to find food , and fresh water and a bywine , and well-to-half billion and a half of people .
It will be more about it to nine billion .
We use more than five billion carbon , 30 billion carbon , more than 30 billion baries .
That means is a million baries a day .
When we try to find biological processes , or any kind of process to replaced them , it 's going to be a huge challenge .
We have to keep the whole of the CO2 emission of these materials that finished in the atmosphere .
At day , thank you very much scientific discovery in the world , we have a databases with about 20 million genes , and I like to think that are the design components .
The electronic industry , it 's about a dozen of understanding , and think about how many different things are coming out .
Our limitations are constructum data in the biological reality and our imagination .
Now we have techniques , thank you very quickly synthesization , in order to create what we call fighting genomics .
We can make a big robot that can produce a million calculate that can produce a million calculus a day .
Think of processing these 20 million genes or to get to get the processes to get the processes to make either , new vaccines , and we can change , thank you very much , and create more biology , so in the last 20 years of science .
And it 's just a standard selection .
We can choose for survival , chemical production or carbon production , or carbon production , or carbon vaccines .
This is an instantanea of some software programs that we 're working on to be able to seats and design species in the computer .
Well , we don 't have to be able .
We know exactly what it is the genetic code .
Now we 're focusing on the fourth of the fourth generation .
You 've seen you that you can get ethanol from the grant was an experiment , it was a finished experiment .
We have carbon on , and third generation that will be going to be like the either , in the higher carbon , as the either either or different kinds of butanol .
But the only way that biology can have a big impact without increasing the cost of food and limitations the cost of food and limitations the cost of food and limitations the cost before , so we 're working on to design cells that they can reach this purpose , and we think we can have the first carbon , and we think we can have the first carbon , about 18 months .
The solar solar light with the CO2 is a metome -- but in our discovery different discovery , metods in our discovery different metods .
This is a organism that we have in 1996 .
It 's about 2,000 feet of the deep-half meters in the ocean temperature in the water .
They create a metane from CO2 molecular hydrogen as a source of energy .
We 're trying to understand if we can can inge CO2 , which can easily be translated to tramate that CO2 in carbon , to drive that process .
So , a little bit about that we could be able to increase what the question of " which is Noothing is , " which is Nooobidden , we have the goal of repair the bottom of repair the whole oil industry .
Exactly . If you can 't do that from TED , where you can ?
It would be a main energy source .
And also , we 're working for use the same metods to create vaccine vaccines .
You 've seen this year with influence , we 're always going to go back to a year and with a dollar when it 's about the wine .
I think what you can change constructing vaccines in ancient .
Here 's how the future might be able to look at , now , the tree of evolution , to accelerating the evolution with bacteria , and finally cell cells .
We 're so much from the improve people .
Our purpose is to do that in a way of living enough to try to get it . Thank you very much .
First of all I 'll just do you see , the fastest , some fundamental work , the new technology that we brought to a pretty much year ago . This is Seadragon .
It 's a environment where you can interact with a huge amount of data that remote with a huge amount of data visual .
Here we 're seeing a lot of giant digital photograph with a kind of photos with a kind of photos and continuous , for a panoramic panoric , I have the pictures like we want .
And not matter how much much it is the amount of information that we see , how big the amount of data or images .
Most are digital common photographs , but this for example is a scanning from the Library of the Congress , and recenter in the gamel of 300 megathering .
It doesn 't make any difference because the only thing that the prestations of a system like this is the number of pixel on your screen in any time . It 's also a very flexible architecture .
This is a book , an example of data not images .
This is Casa desolate Casa desolate chapter .
To show you that it 's about text and not images , we can do something like that , to actually see that it 's a real real representation of the text , not a picture .
It could be a way a little artificial to read a electronic book .
Not the advice .
This is an example . It 's a maker . It 's a number of the Look .
Every image is the beginning of a sexual .
And it gives you the pleasure and the beautiful experience of reading the versues version of a magazine or a quotidian , which is for a molteplice .
We also did something with the angle of this particular number of the Ladian .
We 've created a higher advertissue -- much more higher than what you use in a normal advertising advertising .
If you want to see the carlypes of this car , you can see here .
Or other models , or even the specific specific techniques .
And this really shows some of these ideas to eliminating the limits of space on the screen .
We hope that that means to put up to a few things , and other porcheries , and other porcheries , you don 't have to be necessariarily .
Of course , the map is one of the most obvious applications for this kind of technology .
And on this is not going to lose time , if we don 't have to get to the field .
These are all the streets in the United States in the United States , over a geospa-scenes of NASA .
So now we go to something else .
This is actually actually from the Web ; you can go to see it .
It 's a project called Photosynth , which combine two different technologies .
One is Seadragon and the other is a very interesting computer visual in the computer , in the very interesting computer that was made by Noah Snavely , with aid of Steve Seitz Rick Seitz 's 's Seitz Rick Szeliski Rick . " At Research . " At a great collaboration .
And it 's from the Web , I managon the web , I managon .
You can see this when we do this kind of screen , where we can go from one image to another and have this kind of experience to the last multiple solution .
But the space collocation of the images here actually has a meaningful .
The algorithms of visualization , and that 's recorded these pictures together , so that they 're going to go to the back of the argue -- all the near of the Blagne Roccious , and you 're stopped . Here we give you a slightly . Here you see that the elements of a slightly , and these things are all lines have been all lines to a panoric or imagints .
I don 't know if I have time to show you some other environment .
There are some more space .
I want to go directly to one of the original data of Noah-- and this is from a previous prototype of Photosynth that we 've done for the first time time , I 'll show you what I think is really the key key to show you what I think is really the key key to get this technology , Photosyth . And it 's not necessarily obviously , we 've put in the website .
We had to worry about the legal aspects and forth .
This is a reconstruction of Notre Dame pictures made by Flickr . Bast digitrom Notre Dr. And you 're going to get pictures of the campus , and you get pictures of these cones , other of these cones and you get . And you have one of these unbelief is discovery , it turns out to this model .
So I 'm all pictures made by Flickr and they 've been all linked to the space level in this way .
And that 's possible to navigate this very simple way .
You know , I would never be going to end up to work for Microsoft .
It 's very gratifying to get this kind of accooking here .
I think you can see that it 's a lot of different kinds of photos : from those of the mobile phones that are the mobile phones to the SR , a meanative number of meaningful , put together in this environment .
And if I can , I try to try to those strange .
A lot of people are stuck by doing it , etc .
Some part here , you find a series of photographs -- here .
This is a poster of Notre Dame record Dame recording .
We can go from the poster to the physics of this environment .
The essential point is that we can do things with social environment . This is now taking data from the whole memory of the collective , from the interal point of view -- and you can connect all those data together .
All those pictures become connected together , the higher of the parts .
You have a model of the land that emerging .
Think about this as a prolungation of Stephen Lawler on Earth .
It 's something that grows in complexity as people use , and the advantage to people use , and the advantage to the use .
They have these pictures are marked with meaded by other people .
If you get the idea of to contradicate all these sundrug said the name , my picture of Notter Dr. Do suddenly , I can use this data , and I can use this as a place , I can use how much of those things , and I can use this place in that metap-tains , using the photo to anyone else , and have a kind of a kind of cross-mountain .
Of course , a consequence of all of this is extremely elected , and that 's all the interesting thing about the land , and you know , you 're going to open and similar pictures and similar pictures , but from the collective memory .
Thank you .
CA : I can do that ? What 's good ? What your software is going to take us to do is that at a point , in the next few years , all the photographs that we shared anyone in the entire world will be able to be practically connected together ? What 's your software is going to be practically connected with ? What about your software is going to be doing is that at a point , and you can do that ? What your software is going to be able to do you do is that .
BAA : Yes . What 's doing is doing in practice is to discover .
It 's creating of hyperlink , if you want , you , you 're going to be in pictures .
And it 's doing it in the base at the bottom of the pictures .
The thing becomes very interesting if you think about the receptical retrouble information that many of these images possible .
As when you 're doing a research on the web , you have a phrase and the text on the web page has a lot of information about the pictures .
Now , what happens if that picture is you links to all your pictures ?
So the amount of semantics and the amount of wealth that is really enormous . It 's a classic effect of the network .
CA : Blaise , it 's really amazing . Compedents .
BAA : I 'm going to thank you very much .
One of the main lights when you travel and one of the ethnographics is that we can live between who has no dimented the antials , you have the past in the wind , you 're going to have the past in the wind the wind , you stick in the wind the stage of the plant , the pushing in the wind and levertt-plant .
Basti thinking that the monstramans , and that the world still is beyond the Lattea , or that the monites are still still in the herself , or in Himalaya , or in Himalaya , the budddists still the respair the central of anththropology , and that the idea that the world in which we live in sense , but it 's just a model ,
the consequence of a particular set of adaptative choices that our styrpe has done , well , many generations ago .
And , of course , we all share of the essential tracts .
We all procreates .
We 're subjects that are all the time .
We need to dead dead dead , so we don 't surprising , so we don 't surprise if we can dog and wheless ,
We all have a art .
What it 's the particular one of the song , the ritth of the dance of every culture .
It 's not about that that they 're the Penan forests of the Borneo , or the Cander 's the Cander , or the werrit of Kenya , or a Sath-settle in Kenya sectentya , or a campaign in the heart of the Sahara .
He was my company in the desert a month ago , or a month ago , or a yak in the world 's values .
All of these populations teaches us that there are other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , other ways of moving in the world .
And , if you think you 're going to be a second , it 's a concept that can give you hope .
And then , the myries of the world creating a re-in-spiritual life and cultural , which is the planet and it 's important for the well-being of the planet as the ragnote .
And you can think about this reach cultural cultural ragnosphere , and you can call the etnosphere , and it 's total of all the concepts , dreams , ideas , inspiration , which is inspired , intuitions , that we 're going to be from the imagination from human beings from the consciousness .
The etnosphere is the fantastic patriage of humanity .
It 's the symbbol of what we can be in how much inquisitive species .
And because the biosphere was gravously consumed at the time has been very quickly consumed at the etnosphere and unfortunately .
Nothing , for example , would say that 50 percent , which is about 50 percent of all the species was or is the orgate of the simplest diversity -- in the earth of the oldest diversity -- in the oldest of biological diversity -- and you don 't have a little bit of a little bit -- that of cultural diversity .
It indicates all of that is , of course , the language .
When you were born 6,000 languages on this planet .
A language is not only composed by a vocabolary or a series of rules .
A language is the spraft of human spirit .
It 's the middle with which the animal of every culture comes in the world .
Every language is a forest , a backin , a thought , a backin , a spiritual possibilities .
And of those 6,000 languages , as we 're in Monterey , at least half the half of them , it 's not more ssupply in the orches of children .
They don 't get teached kids , the people who mean , at least that doesn 't really chbed something , which are already died .
What is there more sad than being made from the silence , of being the last to talk about a language , the language , the wisdom of the people of the hand-a-like , you know , the promise of the children ?
This is a little bit of a few of the world every two weeks : every two weeks , every two weeks , and a advancing language and he 's in a ancient language .
And I know somebody who will say , " isn 't that much better ?
The world wouldn 't be a better place if we 're talking about the same language ? " Well , then we talk all about yoruba . Parlian dotonese .
We talk kogi .
You 're going to have a tract thing that means we can 't talk about your language .
I 'd like to do you to do a journey through the etnosphere --
a little journey in the etnosphere to give you a asp of what we 're losing .
A lot of us deal that when I say , " different ways of exist , " I mean different ways of exist .
We take for example , Barasan Amazon , in Amazon , the popular people of anaconda , which creates the myth of the anaconda , which creates the midden of the west in the pants of the west in the west pants of the west in the pants of the west in the pants of the west in the pants .
It 's a popular people that 's not able to distinguess the bllue color from the verge because the time you were identified in the forest , where the popular people .
They have a strange language and a matrimonial rules , said , " " Toks " " " " You have to tell you a different language .
And all that has radical been in the past mitologic , but the particularity is that in these families are in these households where they 're talking to six or seven language .
They 're limited to listen and then they start talking .
We take one of the most interesting tribes that I 've lived , the Waorani of the Ecuadd Ecuad-the-ununbelieved that has had the first contacts in 1958 .
In 1957 , five missionaries have a construct pacting a mistake .
They did get up on the photographs that they reraw them in a place that they were going to come up with that , and that this population of the forest pluvial forest had never seen anything bi-size .
They collected the picture from the land , they 've got to find a shape or a shape and , not find anything , they concluded that it was the hell , and they kill the five missionaries with the lance .
But the Waorani doesn 't kill the straim .
They killed them between them .
54 percent of mortality was caused by them .
We 're alites to eight generations and we found two cases of natural morning and when we 've been born to know , they 'd admit that one of them was invecently so they were invecently , and then they killed him him him the same . [ Raate ] Ad any way , they had an unbelievency of forest .
The cruers were able to recognize the animal from 40 steps and recognizes the species .
In the early ' 80s , I 've been assigned a very interesting task when my professor Harvard , if I wanted to go to Haiti to sweapons between society , and the Take of the potence of Duvalier and Tonton Macooling and Tonton Macooling the Watcooling and I was going to get the grid of the house .
To give a sense of a miracolic , I should buy the Vodoun culture , and the Vodoo is not magic .
It 's pretty much about a metaphoral vision of the world .
A lot of interesting .
If I ask you to tell me the great religions of the world , what do you say ?
Cristianesimum , Islam , Buddism , Ebraism , etc .
A continent is always left out , and I think that Africa has no long-Saa-Saaa-Syan , and the Vodoo is not the other that the distillside of these concepts of the slavery .
What makes the voodoo is the intense rate between life and death .
So , the vision they hide the spirites .
The spirites can be invoced by the Grande Acqua , who are replaced at the end of the dance and the temporarily to the soul of the way that for a short , that for a short , I 'm going to follow the following becomes the .
So , the voodooists like to say , " You white who go to the God .
We say , we say in the temple and say God . "
And from the moment you 're stpossitting , is the spirit that you 're driving you , how you can do you get bad ?
So you 're seeing incredible events : I following the voodoor in the state of trance that touches are impunts a rather strong demonstration of the power of the mind when it 's catalyzed in a state of extreme .
To all the populations with which I 've lived the most extraordinary of Sierra Nevada : the most extraordinary Marta , in Colombia .
It was a refer of the tyranges that once they were living on the caraissn plant , the popular of the conquicist , the popular people were in the conqueren massive , which is rating on the caraibical plants .
In a continent macked in a continent , this popular is never been conquisted by the Spanish .
But they 're now government today , they 're government from a clero , but their formation is very extraordinary .
The young people follows are taken from the families to three or four years , and live in a world of buy and hombrought in a good world , and hombats on the bottom of the glacial for 18 years .
Two periods of nine years choices to reproduce the nine months of the management that transformation in the user of the mother , I 'm not in the utterer of Grande Mother .
For this time , they 're accultured to the values of their society , values that predict their prayers and only their prayers are the cost of the construct balance -- or to say the balance balance .
At the term of this incredible initiation , they 're very landed out and for the first time in their life , at 18 years , you see a hba . And in that active , when the sun is , when the sun sun , when the sun is value of beautiful landscape , all that we learned in theory is conscious , everything that they 've learned in theory . The pret a step back , and he 's saying , and he 's going to be saying , and he 's a step back and he 's the first time in the front of them .
" I said , " With ? I said ,
It 's amazing . Now it 's about you protect it . "
They call them greater brothers and say that we , the minors , we are the collipaign of the world .
This level of intuition is extremely important .
When we think about the Ingene and the environment of the wild , and the old story of the nobile , which is a razen concept in his simplicity or maybe invote Thoreau and we say that these people are closer to the Earth of us .
The Ingenes are not no imental feeling , no imental indebolites .
There is no space for these things in the paludi , or in the wind gelids of the Tibet , but thank you to the time and recover , and they created a mystic intuition of the Earth can only be neighbor about an intuition of the Earth can only live because it 's unhappy .
What does that mean ?
It 's a little girl of the Ande that grow up credating that mountain is a spirit of Apu that will be a human being deeply different . And it will be a very different human being deeply different , and it will have a very different relationship with the mountain that place to a mountain tain tain a massive massive mass of rock proning to be a massive massive mass of rocks to be a rock of rock .
That 's a demour of a spirit or a mineral cutt is irrelevant .
What 's interesting is the metaphor that defines the relationship between individual and the natural world .
I grew up in the forests of the Columbia credating that forests to be cuted .
And I made me a human being different from my friends who believe that the forests are the dimora of Hukukuk and the blind of the paradise and the blind of the paradise and the cannibal that are living in the Hamatsa .
If you start to start considering that these cultures can create reality , you can start buy some of them discovery .
I 've taken this picture to open up in the northern Amazon .
Maybe some of you 've heard about the ayath-like psychologist , the most powerful substance of the repertory .
What makes fascinating the ayathuasking is not the potential of the substance , but his election . It 's made of two things .
At one side , this lian reading land-up set of beta-carboline , harmful and harmful , and harmful , and very hallucinative .
Take the plants has a blum that altera little bit that altera little bit of conconconsciously , but it 's measure with the leaves of the family of coffee said Psychotrist .
This plants contains powered , tripptamine , very similar to serotonin , dimethyltryptamine .
If you 'll ever see Yanomami , you 'll see Yanomami to the birth chor the place that they 're going to have a different set of species , anchropamine .
Tiring that polar on the nose is a little bit like to be disappeared by a carric of paintings and land to land a electricity . [ Risate not believe a distoration of reality ; it 's really not believe the distoration of reality .
I was often a professor with my professor , Richard Evan Shultes , the man who has taken the psychchology , with his discovery of the fungi of the fungi of the fungi of the fungi in the ' 30 in Mexico .
And I think , I can 't be classification , you can 't stop these tripptamines because if you 're not going to tell no one of being hallucinated . But the tripamine pamine pamine allowed by a zoom that is obvious , because I 'm dened by a zoo-sum , because I 'm dened by a monothine .
It 's possible to take the horally , if they 're assume with other chemicals that denize the MAO .
Now , it 's the beautiful : Is s that are in this lian un-inhip vertisers . The question is the kind of necessary to potential trippamine . The question source : in a ffffly , in a flour of 80,000 species , like these people who are not similar , but that if you fighting a biotic track . But if you combined in this way , they create a biochemical version ?
We use the great eupherror of the proof and the mistake , which can reveal infrumption .
But if we ask the Indians , they 'll tell us " The plants are talking about . "
What does that mean ?
This tribes , the Cofan , has 17 varieties of ayathrows , which are neply in the forest , and that you 're going to be in the species .
If you ask the way they 'll say , " I said , " I thought I was going to tell you about the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the respect of all ? "
The solution is : you take the 17 variety in a night and the downloves with a different tone .
With not in Harvard , but it 's much more interesting that content the stones .
Now , [ applaushes the problem is that even the problem of us that have to heart popular people have been pittorthesks , but somehow we reducts to our real world , and pass .
In fact , the 20th century , between 300 years , it 's not going to be reminded , or technologies , but rather as the thing we stopped and actively acked actively or accepted it , or accepted , the destruction of the biological diversity and cultural tural calculation of the planet . Now , it 's not the problem is not the change .
All cultures through the centuries have been involved in a dance of life .
And the problem is not technology .
The Indians Sioux not to be Sioux when they put it in the ark and they 're like this , and they 're not stopped as well as well as well as well as they put in the horse and calute .
It 's not the change or technology that are the integrity of the etnosphere . It 's the power . It 's the power .
The hard of the domination of domination .
And if you give a look at the world , you 'll find that these are not destinated cultures .
They 're living and living dynamics and spints outside of the existence of the forces that go beyond their adaptation of adaptation .
I know , I 'm sitting in the patria of Penan --
a popular noad , in the souther-west , a popular popular , a popular , which has lived in the forest to a generation , and now reduced to the servitore and prostitution on the re-in-fired , where you can see the fix is that it looks like to take away from Borneo Merian , where the snaves the wrote , where the snaves the gylatest Meric 's , where the gonds are the re-being the wastergonte ,
I 'm going to take the wood wood with the subtract forest .
Or , in the case of Yanomami , are disease that I came with the discovery of the golden .
If we move on the mountain of the Tibet , where I 'm doing many research , you 'll see the hard hard hard to the politics .
As you know the genocide , the physical extinction of a popular , is convicted to the Ethnocide , the destruction of life , not just not just convict , but advice celebrated in certain environments .
And you can 't understand the suffering of the Tibet until the beginning .
I 've been on the 6,000 miles from Chengdu in Western China through the Western China , coming in Lhasa with a young link , but only arrived in Lhasa with a young link , but only arrived in Lhasa I realized what we hear .
6,000 sacres reducts in the polar and cenjoy .
1.2 million people killed by military during the Cultural Rivolution .
The father of this guy was ascritical in Panchen Lama .
That means that it was killed by the temple of the Chinese invasion .
I was worse with Santity in Santity during the diaspora that has brought the popular Nepal .
See mother was imprigioned and his colpe was rejected .
It was brought to the age of two years from the age of two years , hidden under his gonna because he couldn 't have any of him .
The sister , who did the same , it was mitted in reeducation reeducation .
A day , he had a day I put a coffign in a cofferigant , and for this transgression , it was mit to seven years .
The Tibet can be unlikely , but the spirit of the popular is to keep in the popular is to keep .
At the fin , all of a choice .
We want to live in the world in the world of the world of the world , or we want to accoooome of diversity ?
The great anthropologist , first of the first died to die , and he said that his biggest was that , in our view of the world , not only we 'll see the entire gamoring of human reduct reduced in a construct modality of human reduction , but one day we 'll see from a sleep deal , we 're going to get other possibilities .
And it 's a look at the species is about 60,000 years .
The Neolitic Riffly , which has gives us the agriculture , which has done us socket , and it 's a little bit of the sm of the smoke with the prosa of of the chaming of specialization , and we talk about 10,000 years ago .
The modern world indualized has 300 years .
And that 's a story not suggests me that we have the rispounds that we 're going to take all the challenges that we 're going to deal in millennia to come .
When we were in these myriades of the world is asked what it means to be humans , they resident with 10,000 voices .
And that 's in these answers that we all have the chance to be what we are are : a kind of conscious , that has to get all the people and all the gardens can be what all of the people and all the gardens can be what we 're going to do .
I 've been taken this picture on the northern extremity of Baffin , when I went to the whales with the Inuit , and this man , Or , and this man , Olaya , he told me the wonderful story of his grandfather .
The canadese government is not always been given with the Inuit 's in the ' 50s to stabilizes our , and we 've got them in colonies .
The grandfather of this man refutt .
The family , I teming for his life , and she took me all the acts .
You 've got to know that Inuit doesn 't have the cold , they stand it can do it .
The pattins of the slitters in the skin were made of heavly in the skin .
The grandfather of this man didn 't have to intimidle or from the libraries that was made .
It 's sgattle , you 've been pantalone in the skin in skin and defocused in your hand . When I did I did it , you 've been doing it , and you 've been working creating a lama .
It 's got spring on the dog of this cock , and when he came up , and when he came solid , he killed a dog .
It 's got a sleep and created a brillighter , with the cast . It 's made a slitta , and it 's disappear to the bone , and it 's disappeared on the bone .
We want to talk about cavarsela with nothing ? [ Risate ] . And this , in different ways , [ Applastic is the symble of the resilience of the popular Inuit and all of the Inuit 's cycle of the world .
In the april 1999 , the world 's replaced the total of the world of the largest territory of the largest California and Texas I put together .
It 's the new patria . It 's called Nunavut .
It 's a independent territory . They all the mineraries .
One of the way of how a natione-state of how a natione-state can recognize with his popular popular .
And , to finish , I think it 's pretty obvious at the people who 's been in these remote artment of the planet , and realizing that they 're not going to be construct .
For somebody 's home .
They represent several human imagination that we have to the date of the time . And for all of these kids , like the dreams of these kids , like the dreams of our children , become part of the hope .
First , we of National Geographic , we convince that politics will never come to nothing .
We think the polemies --
[ Applausi is not persuasive , but we think that stories can change the world , and maybe we 're the best institution to tell the stories of the world . Every month of our website to tell the stories of the world .
156 countries transmit our television down-up canal down-up .
Our revists are thletters from millions of people .
Our work is to travel in the etnosphere to bring our audience in the places that will go out and cultural place that will go out and , and hope , they will be able to , and they 'll be able to , and they will be a clearly , the world deserve in a pluralist and we have to find a life in a pluralist and we have to find a multicultural world and we have to find a multicultural world and we have to find a life in a pluralist and cultural world and and then we have to find a ctured tent .
where the wisdom of all the people can contribute to our well-being collective .
Thank you .
I 'm going to talk about some of the things I written in this book that I hope you 've heard and try to get to prove some of the links , in case , you 're not notice .
I want to start with what I call the official dogma official dogma .
The official dogma of what ?
The official dogma official society all the Western industrial society . The official dogen official : " If we want to massive our citizens . "
The reason is , from one side , in fact that freedom is in itself , is pretious , is pretious , is a useful , it 's pretious , to humans .
And then , the other one of us can do that if we 're free , each of us can act for all that massimilar to our well-being , without no one that decide in our name .
The way to massive freedom is to massive to massive choice .
The more choices people have , more libits , and more , and the freedom , the more or is their well-being .
This , I think , is so deeply radical in society that nobody would have to put it in the dbabe .
And it 's also deeply radical in our lives .
I 'll show you some examples of what progress made possible .
This is my supermarket . It 's not particularly .
I lost a simple note on the conditions .
In my supermarket , there are 175 conditions , without contate the 10 varieties of the extract , and 12 acks that you can buy a huge number of conditions that you can buy you to get a huge amount of conditions that nobody of your degree that nobody of your degree .
Here 's what 's the supermarket .
And then you go to buy a store : you 're going to buy a store : cast , the CD , radio , radio , the light .
And in this single crude , there 's a great number of audio components .
We can make six and a half million different fighting fighting the components that there are in a negogoal .
You have to admit that there is a lot of choice .
At camps : the world of communications .
Once , when I was a child , you could get all the wish services , to pat the daunt that were fornitable by mom Bell .
It was going to panish the phone , you didn 't buy it .
One consequence of that , between the other thing , was that the phone never made .
These days are going .
Now we have a newspaper variety of telephone , especially between mobile phones .
Here 's the mobile phones .
My favorite is that in the middle , lettor P3 , cut out of the nose , and force to the brulb and the hand-up , and the hand-up .
If you don 't have the store under the store under house , you 're just ben to get it .
And what 's going on is that people come in in the negots and this question . And you know , you know , the answer is " No .
It 's not possible buy a cell phone that doesn 't make too many things .
So , in other things that are much more important than the acquired of the acquired , you know , the same explosion of choices .
Axxtustence : not going on in the United States that you go from the doctor and the doctor you have to do .
Instead , I go from the doctor , and the doctor says , " OK , we could do A , or B , " Ages , " Again , " has these well-up and these " Bases and these risks . What do you want to do ? "
You say , " Dotore , what should I do ? "
And the doctor says , " He 's got these benefits and said , " It has these benefits and risks . "
" What do you want to do ? "
And you rebits , " Doctor if she was me , what would do ? "
And the doctor : " But I 'm not . "
The result we call it " autonomous " , " expression that it makes it look like a beautiful thing .
But actually , it 's not that a fishing the weight and responsibility to get decisions from someone who knows something , is the doctor , to someone else that 's not about -- and so much of course , in the ideal condition to make decisions the patient .
There is a huge marketing of products , direct people like me and you , that if you think you can 't buy them , because you think you can 't buy them .
But if we can 't buy them , why do you have public ?
The answer is that they want to domorning , we call the doctor to ask the require .
What we 're fundamental as our identity is a question of choice , as you see in this vigasks , " We don 't want to force children . "
And we can reinvented how many times we do it .
That means that every morning , you have to decide that kind of person you want to be .
I 'm going to take family and matrimony , a time the common perspective , unexpected almost to , it was that you were allowed to be able to be , and he started to get the more price .
The only versus it was with who , not when , and you know what do after .
And so , it 's really about play .
I teach very smart students , and I do 20 percent than a time .
And it 's not because they 're not not because they 're not not because they 're not not because they 're just a brilliant .
but why am I impensive , I mean , I mean , I would say , " Doo I want to get to do it now ? "
" Do I have to get me later ? I have to think before or career ? "
I 'm interrogative logative logorating .
And they try to say , this questions , even if this implation is not complete the compitors that I 'm going to get a beautiful vote to my examples .
And they have to do it . I 'm important questions .
Now , the work : we are lucky , like Carl , because technology allows us to work every minute , every day , from every day , from every day , from every angle of the planet , except that from the Hotel Randolph .
I 'm talking about , there is a angle , and I 'm not going to tell anyone where , where the WiFi works .
I don 't tell you , because I want to use it .
What does that mean , this amazing freedom of choice that we have to work ? It 's to continue , and we have to get any time , if we have to work or not .
We can go to see our son play calcil , with the mobile phone in a rk , Blackberry in the other , and the notebook , and the notebook , typically , on the gink .
And even if I 'm all spent , every minute that we see our son , finished , we 're also asking , " Do I have to say this called ? "
" Do I have to say this email ? I have to get to do this literal ? "
And even when the answer is " no , " all this makes the experience of your son very fun from what it would be in other conditions .
So , anywhere we look , little , things and big , materials , and life , life is a question of choices .
Once the world was this : Of , there was some possibilities , but it was not a question .
The world of today looks like this : The dilemma is : " Is it a positive thing , or negative ? "
The answer is Same .
And positions you know , so I 'll talk about the negative ones .
And all this choice compories two negative effects on people .
The first , I have a paradoxually , is that it produced ed as liberation .
With a lot of options between which choose , it becomes very difficult to do it .
I give you an example : a meanative study on the flap of flight .
A my connects had access to the data of Vanguard , the giant giant society , with about a million clients of a million clients in 2,000 different companies .
What she discovered is that for every 10 solutions that are offered in more , percentage of two percent .
With 50 fundamental fundamental , there 's 10 percent of adesions than when I have only five . Why ?
Because with 50 source fources between which choose , is malttly difficult to decide , and choice is remaining to the tomorrow .
And I asked the tomorrow , and I asked the tomorrow , and of course , I would never come .
You know , it doesn 't mean that these work from the old work for the dangers will be food for not enough money , because they don 't have enough money , it also allow the decision is so hostics that allow the decision is so hostics that allowed the dator of work .
It 's not participating , they 're losing until five to the dator of work , which would be brought to be there .
So the paralalian is a consequence of having too many choices .
And I think that makes the world like this .
" And to finish , for the ethchup : ketchup , send or maion ? "
You would take the right decision , if it 's for the ethernity , right ?
You don 't want to choose the wrong wrong , and you can 't have to choose .
So this is the first effect . The second is that we can avoid paraling and do a choice , at the end we 're feeding , we 're less substantiated by the rest of how we were to be with less options between which chooses .
And that for different reasons .
One of these is that with a lot of people who choose , if you buy a little bit of a and not perfect , it 's not easy to imagine that you could do a different choice that would be better . And what happens is that the alternative imagined us of choice , and the replacening the soddisfing the soddisfing the soddisfing reaching the soddisfenaged by decision , and the reef the soddisfing .
And when it was a good decision .
And so , you know , there 's more easy to dislit than any detail that is unlifetime that is unlike option .
And also , there 's what economists call .
Dan Gilbert has close very well as the value that we value to things depends on what we 're confront of what we confront .
And so , when there are many options , you can be represent the accounteristic active active active active alternative arated and be less subjectate of the option that you 're choice .
Here 's an example . I 've all been in New York .
But that 's what you probably think you 're probably going to think .
There is this copy in Hamptons .
A lussian place .
It 's all about them . It 's all about them . It 's all about them .
Not all . But what he thinks is , " Well , there 's Agotten . "
" All my neighbors in Manhattan is . "
" I could talk about your own front of your home . "
And it 's two weeks I looked at the idea that 's losing -- every day -- every day -- the ability to talk where it wants .
The constantly is deminule opportunity to what we have , even when the choice was excellent .
And the options that we have to look at , more the characteristic active active active active , and they will find out how constitude .
Here 's another example .
This is a very much thing to us .
It talks about the time , and maybe life of the living , and maybe life of the living ,
But the most important thing is that you 're going to be , you go to not do other .
And the things that we don 't choose to attractive , that can make less attractive what we do .
Third point : the spiral growing of expectations .
I tried I tried to my skin buying a new jeans .
I 'm just jeans .
Once the jeans were just a kind of , buy them and bestic them , and they were discovered , only after I had them to be good .
So , I went to buy a couple of new when the old was going to , and I said , " I need a couple of jeans , this is my cut . "
And he said , " Look at the slim , what 's going to do you know , and the relationship to ? "
And you want to do you with the certainer , " Stoneashed " or " " " acidasash " or " " acidases ? "
" Look like ? "
" Have you want to get them to the bla bla bla bla -- " Contince was using it .
I was slord , and after a little bit , I was able to say , " I want to say , " I want to know , " I want to say , " I want to have all the jeans , and then I came out of jeans , and then used the jeans , I would have a better jeans that I 've ever had .
It was the massive . I had the best .
But I felt I worse .
Why ? I wrote a whole book for understanding it .
The reason I was worse is that I was with all that choice was very high , jeans had to be perfect .
I was the beginning I had expectations . I didn 't expect any exciting when it was only one guy , but when I saw 100 different , steps , at least one of 100 different kinds of you should be perfect .
What I had a good thing , but it was good , but not perfect .
After you have to talk about what I was trying to do is I was sationally in confront of the expectations .
The add of options in life , people don 't really want to increasing the expectations that these are respect to the excellence of the options .
And this will be deal with unddisfation , even when the rest of the rest .
Nobody in the world of marketing , and it realized .
Because if they knew , you 're not aware of what I 'm talking about .
The truth is more to this .
" It was better when he was worse , " The reason that was better when he was worse was worse is that when you 're worse was even possible to meet of the resolution .
And so , in the world we live in -- opulents , industrialized citizes with expectation of feeling -- the massive that we can hope is that things are to expectations .
You 're never going to have a pleasant , because your expectations , my expectations , I 'm ingigantic .
The secret of happiness -- what you 're here -- is , " Baswaiting . "
I mean , little biographic moment -- that I really have married and my wife is really amazing .
I couldn 't do better , I couldn 't do , I don 't have any contempted .
But it 's not always a bad thing .
And finally , a consequence of buy a couple of jeans that when there 's only that kind of jeans is that when you 're not really sation-up , and you know , " Why ? "
" Who is responsible ? " , the answer is clear .
The world is the responsible . What could you do you ?
When there are hundreds of jeans , and you buy a insoddisfacing , and you ask you who is the responsible , it 's a clear clear that the responsible you 're in you .
You could do better .
With hundreds of variety of variety of variety , there are not excited for the insuccess .
So when people take decisions , even if the rest is , you 're all satic , they feel insoddisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisappear .
In the last years , the depression is explode in the world .
I think that a significant factor -- not the only , but important -- of this honave of depression is that people have a delusion , because the standard are too high .
And when they have to explain this situation think that the colst is they think that colst is their own .
So the final result is that in general , we 're better , objectively , but we hear a worse .
Let me remember you .
This is the official dogma , what we all take for good and it 's completely fake . It 's not true .
There 's no dbabe that a little bit of choice is better than I have to do , but it doesn 't really get a little choice is better than a little bit .
There is a critical value , I don 't know what it 's .
But I 'm sure we 've been overcome from a piece of the level where the level of choices are better .
Now , from political point -- I 've been a political point -- from the political point , the nocction is the following .
What allows all this choice in the industrial society is rechef .
There are many places in the world , and you know , you 're talking about , where the problem is not that they have any choice .
The problem is that they have too few .
So the fenda I 'm talking about is a males of modern , reflusive , recial society , recial society .
And what it does deprimers and climbing is this : Steve Levitt Levitt talked about how those expensive and discovered that they 're unuseful . It 's a sprite of money .
I mean that these choices , complicated and available , it 's not that they 're just useful .
I 'm very deleteries .
They 're worse .
If a little bit of what in our society is allows , and it 's reversed in those where people have too few possibilities , it would not only have their life to improve but our own own life .
This is what economists call a parety-scale .
A redistribution of the income redistribution is all -- not only to the poor -- because of this choice in excess that we get us .
To conclude , " Filillole , you can become all that you want to --
You , people of culture , you 're going to think , " What do that fish that fish ? "
" It 's obvious that you can 't do anything in a glass . "
" A castrated , a limited vision of the world --
and I 'm going to interpret this this , at the beginning .
But then , I think , instead , I realized that that fish is a long way .
Because the reality of fact is that if you 're sitting in frantum , so that , " everything is possible " you can 't get the freedom . You get the parald .
If you break the bocce in a way that all deminured possible diminured the soddisfation .
And you 're going to get the paralysis , and you 'll reduced the well-being .
Everybody needs a sphere .
This is almost certainly too much , maybe even for fishes , and it 's a surance for us .
But the absolutely symbolic symbolic , is a recil for infelity and , for the sudden .
Thank you very much .
