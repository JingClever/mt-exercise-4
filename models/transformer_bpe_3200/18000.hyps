Last year I showed these slide to show that the glacial calottica , which for almost three million years had the size of the 48 size of the 48 continental .
But this subject of the problem of the problem because it 's not the shape of the ice .
The artical ice ice ice is , in a sense , the clear of the global climate system .
You 're expanded up and you retreat the winter .
The next slide will be a quick , is going to be a quick related to the last 25 years .
Space are signed in red .
As you see , they 're expanded to the blue wall .
That 's the ice in the winter , which is ritizens .
You can see that the cosidln , of five years or more , is like blood , which is like blood .
In 25 years , it 's past , at that .
This is a problem because the heat in the height of the ice , the glacier around the ocean , where there are huge amounts of carbon congle , they 're transformed in the middle of microbes .
I think about the totality of the atmospherical inner from global warming , that amount of of global injectory , that amount of not back .
In some of the laghi , in Alaska is already rebolling by water .
The professor Katey Walter of Alaska is Alaska team of a team of a team pressure of a team of a blow last pin-bottom .
Video : Wow ! Al Gore : Wow ! Al Gore : I 'm going to be , if we 're also going to be .
A reason is that this termal exchange of the Groenland from North .
This is a glacial record .
The landed had never reached to levels .
This is the Kangerlussuaq , in the south-west of the Groenland .
If you want to know how to be the sea level for the ice of the ice for the ice of the ice of the ice , it 's where it reaching the sea .
These current current are .
The other side of the planet : Antartide , the biggest bloclock of the planet .
The month of the month scientists have dichieve that the paint of ice is in negative , and that Antartide , which pogers on some of the submarine islands , is starting to the walk in the welerd .
It 's six feet feet of the activity , like Groenland .
Sulla Himalaya , the biggest third block of ice , you see new latory block , which a few years ago .
40 percent of the world population half of the world 's population half of the potail .
Sulle Ande : this glacier is the source of water .
The luck is increased .
But when it 's when it diminds , the same happens to water .
In California , the nenow , in the Sierra Nevada is diminured 40 percent .
Once idrices are in crisis .
The predictions , as you read , they 're good .
The growing smart smart in the world door to a remarkable .
The environmental disaster of the environmental , and without previous .
Four times more numer-year-old numer-year-old numbers .
This is a whole thing that 's insustainable .
If you look at the historical context if you can see the consequences .
In the last five years we add 70 million tons of CO2 every 24 hours -- 25 million tons in the ocean every day .
Look at the Eastern area of the Eastern Pacific , to the west parts of the substance of the continent parts , where there 's a radical imor oxygen in the ocean .
The major cause of global warming , together to deforestation , which is 20 percent of fossil fuel combustible .
Or is a problem , and the carbon is even worse .
The United States are one of the two countries with the most emissions , together to China .
And he was proposing to build a lot of other carbon .
But we 're seeing a direction .
These are the anullated projects in the last few years and some versus of the versus .
And so , there 's a political load in our country .
The carbon industry and oil have spent 250 million dollars in the last year to promote carbon , which is a bunch of bunch , which is a oxygolden .
That 's a picture of a little bit of a --
And Natal , in Tennessee , where I live , there was a pair of 3.8 billion guns of a 3.8 billion gaps .
Maybe you saw it on the news .
This is the second biggest flow of last phie in America .
It 's happened around Natale .
The advice of one of the carbon industry was this .
Video : It 's going to be a high--a-like , and happy .
It 's abundant here in America , and it 's growing our economy .
From CExium is more and more and more cleaning .
It 's good price , adorable and the work of the work , they 're going to be penon .
Al Gore : From here is a lot of coal West Virginia .
The biggest minerair , the bigger minerair Coal . This is his administrator .
Video : Don Blankenship : I 'll have to have -- Al Gore , Nancy Peloid Peloid -- they don 't know what they 're talking about .
Al Gore : So the Alleance for Protext of Clima has launched two campaigns .
This is one of them , one part .
Video : Actually : Actually , the climate change change , like a minute of a minacting to our business .
So , for our priority is to invest a big amount of money in a bunch of money in a public effort to make public and confused the truth .
It 's actually , carbon 't sporite .
We think it 's cleaned -- it 's also a good profum .
So , not preocubia change climate change .
Let me do it .
Video : Actually : Carbone , you 've heard a lot of talk .
So we 're going to do a turn into a structure to avaning out of carbon ,
Straordinary ! The machines are a little rumor , but this is the sound of carbon technology .
The carbon consumption is between the main cause of global warming , but the remarkable of carbon , which is the pulilit that you see everything .
You look at a look : this is the carbon odiergn .
Al Gore : Infinally , the positive alternative , and that 's conflict to the economic issues .
Video : The America is in crisis , the economy , the economy , the national security .
The fix that connects all of the : our dependence of fossil fuel combustible , like carbon fuel and oil .
Now , there 's a new , of solution , of solution to use it .
Repower : 100 percent of cleaning energy in 10 years .
A plan to reput America to work , to make sure more , and help stop the global warming .
Finally , a solution that babs to solve our problems .
Repower America . Scot 's more .
Al Gore : This is the last .
Video : How to report energy to America .
One of the fastest ways of bring to dependence by combustible , which is , they 're going to kill our planet .
Comparsa : The future is here . I feel , a new energy network .
Norts : Neggs : Neggs for ben retribits .
A Repower : Repower America . It 's time to be realists .
Al Gore : A old African , says , " If you want to go fast , you 're going to go fast .
If you want to go back together . "
We have to go back , fast .
Thank you very much .
Last year , at TED , I did a introduction in the LHC .
And I promise to return to get back to you about how the machine works .
So there 's a few . And for the ones that 's not , the LHC is the biggest scientific experiment that 's ever tremendous scientific experiment ever , 27 kilometers of circuit .
His complished is to return the conditions that were present less than a billion billion billion times a second from the beginning of the universe -- until 600 million times a second .
And that 's just just environmentous .
This is the machine in Ginevra .
We 're going to take these min-Big Bang in the detectors .
That 's what I work . It 's called AS -- is large-foot 44 meters and has a diameter of 22 meters .
This is a spectacular picture of ATLAS in building that so you can see proportion .
TTTTs , we have accesished the machine for the first time .
And this picture was taken by ATLAS .
It was cause of immense festeggies in control .
It 's an image of the first of particles that had done all the LHC , entering in collision , deliberately , with one part of the LHC , and spread particles inside the detector .
In other words , when we see that image 10 sets , we realized that the machine worked , which is a great witory .
I don 't know , I don 't know that , if you 're going to do that , when someone went on on Google , and he saw that the page was this .
What it means we have a cultural impact beyond .
About a week after , there was a problem with the machine , which was just to these file bles here -- these figored .
These files are going to take 13,000 amping when the machine works , the massive of the power of the power of the power of .
Now , the technical technical between you will look at the file and say , " It 's not true . I 'm fixed too sot-. "
And they can do it because when they 're very cosiddles of the Buils , they can do it because when they 're very cool cosiddles .
So , at least 271 degrees , at least 271 degrees , in the middle of the stars , these bucks can bring that running .
In one of the giuntures of the magneti notes in the LHC , there was a phabycle difed .
So the file is surrounding , and the 13,000 amping suddenly met a electrical resistence .
This was the result .
Now , this is more impressive if you think that these magneti fish more than 20 tons , and that 's moved about 30 centimeters .
They 're sorts of cut , about 50 magneti .
We had to take them , what we did .
We have represent them and enaged them .
They 're recently return all to their place place .
By the end of march the LHC is going to be integrate again .
We 're going to access it , and we 're expected to get data , and we 're going to continue so our adventure to find out what the universe is the morning that 's the universe .
Now , of course , in a way of these , these accidents return the dibate on the value of science and engineering in front of science and engineering in front .
I think the fact that it 's so hard , the fact of going to be beyond the limits , I think that 's the value of things like LHC .
I would like to end with the words of a English scientist , Humphrey Davy , which I imagine , in difenhurt , the inusey of the cannot have a bunch of the idea of what the idea that the idea of report of human mind , which is not a lot of the human mind as the progress of the human mind , which is definitive science of the human mind , which is not a new monstor of the world . "
Thank you .
I want to start asking you to rethink about when , as a children , play cookid .
And as you can understand how to reach and get them , take them and move them , and you know , you know , actually , and you know , and you know , and you know , and you know , and you know , and you know , and you know , and you know , and you know , and you can actually get them to be able to think and solve problems .
The space reasoning is deeply connected to the way we understand a lot of the world around us .
So , from information usulabor of our interaction with physics , together to my physical physical objects , and at my collaborator Jeevan Kalanithi , I started to ask ask ask ask ask ask , " And if , when we use a computer instead of having the only cursor , we could deal with a gyp-woooooden , we could deal with a drug , with an information , we could affect your hands , with your hands , with your hands ,
and how to make it as a please ?
The question was so interesting that we decided to explore the answer , building Siftable .
In a few words , a Siftable , a great thing like a biscope .
In a few words , a Siftable , a great thing like a biscope .
You can move with the hand , they can see , " between them , " You can see " between them , you know , and they 're going to get a screen .
But basically , they 're physical objects , like the morning , can move away from just mistake .
The Siftable is the example of a new ecosystem to manipulate digital information .
And as they get more physicist , you know , the other motion , and as they 're as more physical , conscious , of how they die , we can explore new and different sticks of interaction .
I 'll start with some simple example .
This Siftable is configurated to show the video : if you 're going to put it in a direction , video , the video rate , the way , if you 're going to hit .
These interactive rats are conscious to other people .
If they 're interested in what they 're interested in what they 're around .
If they 're circumb , they can see it and they can do a little bit .
If they 're circumb , they can see it and they can do a little bit .
They also have their crossing and inclination .
We then realized that one of the interaction of the interaction was that they could use common managed managed to the data , for example , " we 're paid . "
In this case , we have three Siftable , as a bunch blow and I can use it to blow color in that central , where you 're mix .
and I can use them to the color in that central , where you 're mixed .
If we 're too too , we can put a little bit of place .
I also have to you , you know , the mathematics and logical games where people can try and things that are very quickly , and see the result of it , and see the result of it .
I 'm now --
This is a Fibonaccount of the equations I do with a program .
Here we have a words that 's half between Scarabeer and Boboble .
Pratically , at every turn-re-case letter , in every Siftable , Pratically , at every turnal turn-case , on every Siftable , and while you 're looking at the end of the dictionary .
Then , after about 30 seconds of the remisses , and you have a new set of lecture and new chance to try .
Thank you .
Here 's what children came to the Media Lab , I did it in a way that triased them and I went to a video .
They are very please .
And one of the interesting things of this kind of application is that you don 't have to give people a lot of education .
You 've got to say , " Compons of words , and they know exactly what to do .
Here 's what 's what they 're going to do .
This is our young Is tester , and on the right .
It was actually wanted to impilling them .
They only were morning , for him .
Now , this is an application of a interactive chart .
We wanted to build a tool for the appricing of language Lui is Felix .
It can put new characters in the scene , you 're just going to get the Siftable .
It can put new characters in the scene , you 're just going to get the Siftable .
So , it 's doing the sun .
Video : The sun is smile .
David Merrill : Now , she 's taken a treat .
Video : The treat treat .
Bel work ! Yeah !
So , by eight and the Siftable and can make your characters --
Video : Bau !
And by inventing their story .
Video : Hio !
DM : It 's a story with the open-up , and it can decide him how you 're going to sell .
DM : It 's a story with the open-up , and it can decide him how you 're going to sell .
Video : Very on , y-to-.
DM : The last example I have time to show you is a tool , which is a tool , which is a tool , to sample and exececececectual .
It 's a tool , it 's a tool , to tramples and executionary music .
The Siftable here , they 're aging sound as the bass and bacteria .
Each one of these has four different different variations , and you can choose to use .
You can also insert these sound in a sequence of understanding your please .
And it 's just just doing touch a sound , and a sequence . "
These are actually actually that you can control from the vial , like reverber and the filter .
It 's acks a particular , and then inclens for them .
And then there are the general effective as time and volume , which is applied to the entire sequence .
Let 's look like it works .
Video : DM : We 're going to try and and put a base in two Siftable , we 're going to put it in a series , we 're add .
Now I put a bottom line .
Video : DM : Now I add of perception --
Video : DM : And I 'll put the bacteria , so I can control the effect of the bacteria , so I can control the effect .
Video : DM : I can get the entire sequence of inclining time by one side .
Video : DM : And I 'm going to add the bottom of the bass to give more expression .
Video : DM : I can recombine the sequence of the flight .
So I don 't have to do it before , but I can improve , make it over the longer .
And now , finally , I can spread the entire sequence on the left is the Siftable .
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is to build new interfaces of the most of the best machine as the brain work and body .
And I had time to show you one of the result of this path , and also some chance we try to bring out of the lab .
The concept I want to put you is that 's coming to this new generation of designed objects to interact with digital media , which will bring information in our world that we want .
Thank you very much .
I don 't see the now of talking to all of you .
I 'm a writer .
I 'm going to cross books is the profession , but it 's more than that , of course .
It 's also love and the fascination of my life .
And I don 't expect that it can change .
But , I said , something particular , something happened in my life and in my life , and in my career , which has brought me to recalibrate the entire relationship with this work .
The particular thing is that I recently written this book , this biography called " Mangia , Prega , " which is a kind of a bookstage , for some reason why I came out in the world and became a big , bestyle , and it 's a great feelational , bestyle .
And the result is that everywhere is now , people treat me as if I was concerned .
And that 's really -- you 're conconconvicted .
They 're all about me , you 're all worried and say , " You can 't you do it more than doing better ?
You don 't have fear to continue to writing for all of life without being able to create a book that can be someone ? "
which can be importance to someone ? "
It 's recertainly , you know .
But it may go worse , part of the one remember , more than 20 years ago , when I began to say , I was an adolescent -- I wanted to be a writer .
I was in the same reaction , I was in the same reaction .
And people said , " Don 't you could not do it success ?
Do you don 't care that the launch killed you ?
You don 't care of doing this to mestize for all of life without anything that anything else is ever out and die on a cue pile of dreams with the pile of failure .
So , you know .
The answer -- the short answer to all these questions is , " Yes . "
Yeah , I fear with all those things .
I 've always had fear .
And I also fear of many other things that people can 't have to inguess .
As the algae and other things .
But , for that , what I thought , and I would ask me , and I have a last multiply is why ?
Is it rational ?
It 's logical that anyone who has been waiting to be spent by a job that you know .
But what 's this particular , in the business business of creative , and it 's nervous , in a way that other career .
How father , for example , he was a chemistry engineer and not remember one time in his 40 years of activity that he was asked if he was paar to be engineer ?
There was never -- that block of the engineer John , how does it go ?
It didn 't work that , you know ?
Onestly , the chemicals like group have no group of them , in the centuries , warning the reputation of being alcolized .
We 've been writers , we have this reputation , and not just writers , but creativity of every kind of , we have this reputation of being enormous .
And it 's not the other than you look at the triad of the magnifetime of the magnifments of the magniftent century , they die young people and often .
And the ones that you don 't have sound to be really disfaced by their dunones .
Nortman Mailer , before he died , in the last interview said , " Every , a little bit more , an extraordinary affermation about the work of their life .
But we don 't really understand that when we heard these things so much long-term , because we 've heard these things so long , and accepted the notion that creativity and suffering is in some way of reading and that art , at the end , it will always have to get to the ange .
And the question I want to ask all of this today is : you know , you know , what ?
You 're good to you , because it 's looking at the way of a distance to me , not good for anything .
I think it 's odious .
And I think it 's also dangerous and I don 't want to see the next century .
I think it 's better encouraging our big creative minds .
And I certainly know that , in my case -- in my situation -- it would be very dangerous , I 'm going to start with that disruption , substances of the circumstances that are in my career .
Of course -- I mean , I 'm pretty young , young old , I 'm about 40 years .
I still have about four decacades of work in me .
And it 's very likely that anything I 'm going to be judge from the world as the work that came out after the world as the work .
I 'm going to be slavef , because we 're all more or less friends here -- it 's likely that my greatest success is .
Oh , Gesus , who thought !
You know , this is the kind of thought that leads a person starting to bar in the nine of the morning and I don 't want to do it .
I would continue to do this work we 're going to continue to do this work .
So , the question is the question , what ?
And so I think , after a lot of reflection , which way to work to continue to continue to writer is that to create a psychological psychologic , OK ?
I have to find a sense of security between me , which I 'm writing , and my natural anxiety that wrote , and I was looking for all last year , looking for all last year , looking for the whole year , looking at the time , looking at the time , looking at the time , trying to find other society to see if they could have better ideas and more healthy and sane , if they could have some of the best ideas and sane , and then I 'm writing
how to help people creative inerent people managing inerent emotional risks .
And that research took me to the Grek and ancient Rome .
Seguiteas because I 'm giving in your circle and then back .
In the ancient Greek and ancient Rome -- people didn 't seem to believe that creativity came from men , OK ?
It was thinking that creativity was this spirit , and that came out of men , and that they were in the way , and they were indicated by some kind of distant and unknown .
The Great were called these spirites , the spirites of creativity .
Sockitches , he believed to have a bunch that helping to have a sague that was .
Roands were the same idea , but they called that kind of spirit without a genius .
That 's great , because Roands didn 't really think that a genius was somebody particularly smart .
And they have to have a genius was this kind of divine that was living in the muri of an artist , a little bit like the elpho Dobby , and that 's like the elpho Dobby , and that came out of the argue of the artist and models the result of that work .
Extional -- here is the distance of which I talk -- that 's the psychological construction that you protected from your work .
And they all knew that it was so that it worked , right ?
So the anti-artists were protected by certain things , like , for example , too much , not ?
If your work was exceptional , you couldn 't take it all the deserve , all of you know that they had been helped by this genius .
If your fails work , it wasn 't all your own own , right ?
Everybody knew that it was your genius to be a unable .
And so people han conceived creativity in Occient for a lot of time .
And then the Rensiting came and everything , and it 's going to change this big idea ; we put the human being in the middle of the universe on the middle of the universe .
This was the principle of the rational principle and people begins to think that creativity came out of the ililishing .
And for the first time in history , you start to refert this or that artist like a genius , like a genius , like a person with genius .
And I have to tell you , I think that was a big mistake .
I think I allow someone , a simple person to believe that they 're like a recipient like the source , the absorges of all the mysteries , creatives , unknown , and creatives , unknown , and you know , and that 's a lot of too big human beings .
It 's like to ask someone to enjoy the sun .
Deform and deform of the ego and creates all these ingestablishment .
And I think it 's been this pressure to have artists in the past 500 years .
And if that 's true , and I think that 's the question , the question becomes , and now ?
Can we do that diversity ?
Maybe back to a more antical understanding of the relationship between humans and mystery creative .
Or maybe no .
Maybe we can 't cell 500 years of rational thinking in a 18 minutes .
And there 's probably people in the audience that would be reading the scientific sospects on the notion of , you know , they follow the people spend up the next people 's given in the projects .
I 'm not going to tell you all about this .
But the question I would like to ask is , why ?
Why don 't I think that in this way ?
Because it 's a sense of anything that has ever heard to explain the imprevedibility of creative process .
A process that , as anyone who ever taught of doing something -- so , basically , all of course , you 're all here -- you don 't compories .
And , in fact , it can sometimes seem completely paranormous .
I did this inagainst recently in the Ruth Stone , who has now 90 years , but that 's a poeter for all of life and said that during his infection in the rural Virginia , working out in the rural Virginia , and he felt it , when a poem was a landscape .
He said that it was like a frageous train of air .
And that was rotating towards her paesished .
He felt it to get it , because he was going to get down under his feet .
He knew I had one thing to do to do at that point and he was , words , " run like a matta . "
And so he 's going to correct home and it was going to be able to take a piece of paper and a piece of paper and a matit 's fast enough , and the trapon , and the herself on the page .
Sometimes he couldn 't be enough to be fast enough , so he 's correcve and he 's not going to get to the house and poem , and she was going through and she loved it and she would continue to round and she would continue to round the landscape , looking for , as she said , " another poet . "
And then there were those times -- this piece of not dementize , I 'm going to be , right ?
So , he was running home and he was looking for the card and the poetry was in the way , and he was a math in the way , and then he said , that it was like if you 're going to go with the other hand and the wild .
It was the poetry of the poetry and put it in his body and transcscscreen .
And in these cases , the poetry would have been presented on the perfect page , but by the last word .
So when I heard that -- it 's crazy , it 's exactly the same same as my creative process .
Not all my creative process -- I 'm not a concert .
I 'm a mulo , and my way of working is ; you know , you know , and I 'm going to play and go on on the goal and work on it .
But even I , in my testing heading , I 've been brought against that thing , sometimes .
And I also imagine many of you have done the han .
You know , even if the work and ideas came to me from a certain source , you can 't honestly sake it .
And what is this thing ?
And how can we relate it to it it in a way that we don 't lose your mind , but rather , what does it remain sani ?
And as I mean , the best example , the best example , I have is the musician Tom Waits , which I 've interviewed different years ago for a newspaper .
We were talking about this , and you know , Tom , for the majority of life has been the incarnation of the argue , looking for control , looking for control , to control these species , domining these species of impults .
But then I 'm invited , I 'll put it , and one day , and one day , while he was driving on a road in Los Angeles , it 's all for him .
He was going to be fast and everything of a sent traat this little framtion of melody , which comes in his head as the inspiration , and it 's hallpointed , and you know , it 's wonderful , and you know , it 's wonderful , and the desider doesn 't know how to take it .
It 's not a piece of paper , it 's not a match , it 's not a recorder .
So I was going to hear this kind of old old old , and he 's going to go out , and I 'm going to lose , and I 'm going to lose and hasn oxxioned by this song .
I 'm not good enough and I can 't do it . "
And instead of going to go to the panic ,
He 's got the entire mental process and he did something completely new .
And I just just just the sky and said , " Scuses , you can 't see that I 'm driving ? "
" Who looks like that can write a song .
If you really want to exist , you 're going to get me about you .
Actually , you 're going to importantly someone else today .
I got to disturbing Leonard Cohen . "
And his process worked after that .
Not the work , the work was still dark .
But the process , and the fish that was remajor was releaved when the genius , the genius that outside of him , the genius of him out of him , and it 's going to go back from where , realizing that didn 't have to be a whole thing .
But yes , yes , this peculiar , wonderful bizarre in the Tom and this strange and exterm that it was not Tom .
So , as I heard that story to change a little bit that way I worked and I was always saved and I 'm always saved .
This idea , I was , when I was writing , " Mangia , Prega , " and it 's a bunch of those cave the disperation that we all of when we 're working on something and we can 't start to think that will be a disaster , which is the worst book book that 's the worst book book that 's worst book written .
Not only bad , right , right the worst book written .
And I began to think of gave this project .
But then I remember Tom who talked to the air and you tried to it .
So I was my face in the dark and I 'm breaking my committed and a vacuum of the room .
And I said , " Supper , " Supper , what we know that if this book is not going to be brilliant , not going to be brilliant , no ?
Because as I see you all see I 'm going to do with all I have , I don 't have this .
So if you want to be better , you have to present you and do your part .
OK . But if you don 't do it , you know what , you know , it 's not a gift .
I 'm going to write the same because it 's my work .
And I would like to please that it was recorded that I 've been presented to do my part , " Because -- finally , finally , OK -- you know , and then , and it 's the sacket of the bunch of bunch and music that would go on for the dams and the music that went on for the datyes , and the dalone .
And they were always magnify , because the ballerins were professionals and they were fantastic .
But every time , rarely , something happened , and one of these artists became actually transcendent .
And I know you know what I 'm talking , because I know you all saw , at a performance so .
It was like the time , and the ballerine walked through a kind of land-up , and it was doing anything different from the solitititness , like 1,000 night , but everything was all of it .
And suddenly , it doesn 't look like a human .
But he 's accese from the divinity in the fire of divinity .
And when this happened , the time , the people knew what was , they called it .
They would say , " Allah , and they began to dog , " Allah , Allah , God God , " God , God , " God , " God , God , "
That 's God , you know .
Curious note -- when the Mori invaser the Spain , preserent this abitude with them and the pronounced by " Allah , " to " Alah , Allah , " to " Ole , " the " one , " which you can still hear in the corries or in the flamp .
In Spain , when a artist did something impossible and magic , " Allah , Allah , , Allah , By , , the baby , which is , in God .
And it 's great because we need .
But the problem comes the day after , for the ballerin the same , when you 're waiting and discover that are 11 of the morning and Martedouble , and that 's not .
It 's just a mortal with gran bad wink , and maybe it 's never more to do it .
And maybe nobody 's the name of God , and what 's going to do with the rest of his life ?
It 's hard .
This is one of the most paint recognize to make in a creative life .
But maybe it doesn 't have to be so angoal if you can 't believe , and you can 't believe , and more extraordinary aspects of your being from yourself .
But you would just say that they 're data in prested by an inimaginable source of this team that you have to go .
And , you know , if we think about this way everything changes .
And so I started thinking about , and it 's certainly how I thought about it for different months in the work of the book that I 'm going to public book , the dangerous , spaving , attesissued , waiting for the success .
And what I have to continue to tell me when I feel electritried by this is , it 's not fear .
It 's just just your work . It 's just your work .
You 're going to present you for your part , any can be .
If your work is ball , you know .
If the divine , absurd on you assigned to you , you know , just a few kind of wonderful , for a moment through your effort , then , you know .
And you 're doing the same dance .
And , " Ole ! " You know . "
I think , and I think I have to teach it .
" Ole ! " You know , it 's just for human-to-wel tale of the tal tali tali to make you continue .
Thank you .
Thank you .
June Cohen : Ole !
As I 've already talked about some of these projects on genome , what it can mean and on the discovery of new set of genoes .
Now we 're starting a new path : we started to digitalize biology and now we 're coming from that digital code we 're coming into a new phase of biology , design and design and synthesizing and synthesize .
We 've always tried to ask a big questions .
What 's the life ? " It 's something that many biologists have tried to figure out of vary .
We 've tried different approaches , reduced the minimum .
We 're digitizens from almost 20 years .
When we sequenced the human genome was treated by the world analome of the world of the digital world .
Now , we can we regenerate life , or create new life from this digital universe ?
This is the map of a small organism , Mycoplasma genitalium , which is the species from the small genome that can authorean .
And we tried to reduce the genome of creating a little bit more small .
We can get to eliminate a hundred genes of genes of about 500 that are here .
But when we take a look at his metabolic map , it 's relatively simple than our .
I think , this is simple .
But when we look at all the genes that we can take , one at the time , it 's very unlikely that this can bring to a living cells .
So we decided that the only way we decided to make this only crumosoma to prove some of these crumosoma , so that we could have the components to bring some of these fundamental questions .
And so we started the adventure of " CCan we can synthesize a chromosome ? "
Can it conhear that chemistry of produce these big molecules that we never have to create before ?
And in case of affermative , we can make a chromosome ?
A chromosome is just a piece of inert material chemical material .
The speed with which we 're able to digitalize life is growing to rethrow exponential .
Our ability to write the genetic code , instead of progrek , but it 's better .
And our most recent result of the exponential curve .
We 've started more 15 years ago .
The process require a lot of passages , starting with a biothetic review before we began to the first experiment .
But we found that synthesize DNA is very difficult .
There are tens of thousands of cars in the world that produce small DNA segments of DNA , in the long age of 30 to 50 letters and it 's a degenerative process : the most eror or segment is longer .
So we had to develop a new method to make these framments and correct the mistakes .
And that 's the first attempt , to start by digital information of the genome of the British information genome .
It 's a little virus that kills bacteria .
We designed the fragments , effective the correction of the mistakes and get a molecule of DNA , about 5,000 letters .
The interesting part of the thing is when we took this piece of inert material , and we put it in bacteria , the bacteria have started read this genetic code and produring the viral particles .
The viral particles have then been released by cells , they 're back and back and they have destructed the E.
I talked to recent recent with the oil industry is saying their own which they have certainly compressed this model .
They have recently reporter .
We think that 's a situation where the software can actually actually actually build his hardware in a biological system .
But we wanted to do things in the big .
We wanted to build the entire chromosome of bacteria .
They 're over 580 miles of the genetic code .
So we thought we built it in the cassets of the virus , so that we can change the cassets to understand what are the components of a living cells .
The design is crucial , and if we start with digital information in a computer , these have to be very accurate .
When we sequenced this genome for the first time in 1995 , the most-awardness was of a mile for every 10 miles .
We found it , resequenced , 30 errors . If we used that original sequence , we would never have been able to do it work .
One of the process of designing is design segments that are underpaying with all the other 50 letters to build sover-up subunits to build sounity little bit of the work together .
We 're going to try to the only one here .
You probably have a bed thing that we 're going to have a lot of fligrade .
And we think about this : we have a genetic code on four letters : A , C , Gs and T.
Three of those letters together , they 're about 20 admit , and there 's a specific order to read for every friend of the letters for every fright-to-a-.
So we can use the genetic code for write words , thinking .
What we 've done in the beginning is autographed .
Some of the people have been delusers from the fact that it wasn 't poem .
We designed these segments for a few chologists just just just to get with zyourself .
There are some of them to get them and put them .
And we started assembly assembly with segments , starting with segments from five to seven , and they can make a bunch of 24 miles in a way to get 72 miles to their time to 72 miles .
And we made these smodly , we made these segments in abundancy , so that we 're trying to create a very very robustobey-like , you 'll see in a minute .
We 're looking for self-self-remarkable .
So , this looks like the tabellon of a basket .
When we get to these very long , much more than 100 miles , over 100 miles , they will not grow more directly in the Eccles .
It 's to the limit of modern biology is molecular biology .
So we looked at some other mechanisms .
We knew about another mechanism called recombination omologue , which in biology is ulizy to repair the DNA to repair the DNA .
Here 's an example .
This organism , called Deinococcus radiodurans , can absorb three million radiation .
You can see in the sound squarer as his chromosome of the crossing .
In 12 -- 24 hours , it 's replaced as it was .
They 're able to do that .
These organisms can sit completely .
They can live under vacuum .
They 're absolutely sure that life exist in space , and you feel to find new environments of water .
ASA showed the NASA showed that this is .
This is an image of molecule that we built by using these processes , just using the design of appropriate design , and you just use the design of appropriate .
The authomatically assembly .
This picture was not taken with a micro-digit was not taken with a microscope . But with a microscope .
It 's a molecule that we can see it with a light microscope .
These are pictures that 's a time of about six seconds .
This is the advertising that we did a little time ago .
They 're over 580,000 letters of the genetic code .
It 's the biggest molecules of a defined structure .
It 's got a lot of perior in 300 million .
If you 're going to stick it with a 10 without spaces , you would like 142 page , you would like 142 , you want to do that .
Now , how do we do it work ?
Of course , you 're tramitely , a virus is a game .
It 's a little bit more complicated when you use bacteria .
It 's easier when it comes from eucariote cells like , you can just extract the nucleo and put another , which is basically the process of cloning .
In the bacteria is the chromosome is integrated inside the cells , but we recently demonstrated that we 're able to do a complete trapieces of a cell cell . But one cells a cell that one cells to another and activate it .
We can get a chromosome , starting from a microbial .
The two are different as men from the topes .
We add some gene gene in a way that they can decide what to this chromosome .
And then I 'm skid with the enzymes to kill all the proteins .
And when we put it in the cells is stupenciple -- and you will open our own own paint -- the new chromosome -- the new chromosome of it .
And we begin , we were thinking that we couldn 't go beyond , but we tried to spingerve .
This is one of the major mechanisms .
We found that tanti-to-to-like , or a third chromosome , add in a second thousand new tracks of that species .
So who thinks about evolution as a gene , and at the time you have no understood free of the biology .
They 're going to be called " " " " " " " " " " " " It 's going to be a DNA DNA .
The chromosome that was in the cells doesn 't have one .
The cell phone chromosome that we have inserito--shit .
It 's expressed , and he recognized the other chromosome as a cross-like material material , and we 've got round with only cells and the cell the new cell .
It 's got blue because of the genes we 've got inserted .
And in a short leap of time , all the characteristics of a species , you know , and it 's transformed all in a new species , based on the new software that we 've inserted in cells .
All the protecs have changed , the membrane has changed , and when we read the genetic code . And when we read the genetic code .
Now , this may seem altering altering , but altering the software , we can change things in a substantial enough .
Now , I 've already explained that you don 't talk about genesis -- but to progress from three million years and a half of evolution , and I said that maybe we 're going to create a new kind of a new version of the Cambrian explosion of the Cambrian explosion of this process .
Why do that ?
I think it 's obvious when we think of our necessarily .
We 're going to move from six billion and a half billion people in the next 40 years .
Right for example , I was born in 1946 .
Now there are three people on the planet for each existing in 1946 , in 40 years , there will be four .
We 're having problems now to find food , fresh water and pull , medical water and heavy for six billion and a half billion people .
It 's going to be more than that .
We 're using more than five billion bucks , more than 30 billion bariles of olider .
That means a hundred millions of baries a day .
When we 're looking at the biological processes , or any kind of process to replacing them , it 's going to be a huge challenge .
We have to keep the whole whole emission of CO2 , from these materials that finished in the atmosphere .
At the day of today , because of the scientific discoveries in the world , we have a database with about 20 million genes , and I like to think they 're the designed for the future .
The electronics is only a dozen of about components , and think about how many different things are coming out .
Our limitations are just the data from the reality and our imagination .
Now we have techniques , because of these rapids of synthetization , in order to create what we call genomics .
We can build a big robot that can produce a million chromosomes a day .
Think of processing these 20 million genes of genes , or to optimize the processes to produce either or drugs , new vaccines , we can change , thank you very small team , and create more biology now that in the last 20 years of science .
And it 's just a standard selection .
We can choose for possibility of survival , chemical production or carbon production , or production of vaccines .
This is an instantanea of some software programmed software program that we 're working on to be able to seat and design species in the computer .
Well , we don 't know what they 're going to be .
We know exactly what the genetic code .
Now , we 're focusing on the fourth of the quarter generation .
You 've seen even even you who extract ethanol was an experiment that 's been an experiment .
We have carbon , and third generation that are going to have enough enough to be herself as as the either , or different kinds of value as the either either , like the either or different kinds of butanol .
But the only way that biology can have a big impact without increasing the cost of food and limit the cost of food and limitation the cost of the food , it would be transform CO2 in matter before , so we 're working on to design cells that they can reach this , and we think of that that we have the first carbon , and we think we can have the first carbon ,
The solar light with the CO2 is a metodo-- but in our discoveries , we 've found different metods .
This is a organism we 've described in 1996 .
He lives in the ocean , about 2,500 meters of deep--foot , at the temperature of water .
They have a half of CO2 using hydrogen molecular hydrogen .
We 're trying to figure out if we can intubes the CO2 , which can easily be translated to tramitate that CO2 in carbon , to drive this process .
So , we think we could be able to increase what we could be able to increase what the basic question of " which is Noi , verorem -- we have the modth of replacement that we can be the bottom industry .
Exact . If you can 't do it from TED , where you can ?
It would be a main of energy .
And , we 're working for using the same metods to create vaccine instant vaccines .
You 've seen this year with the flu , we 're always back to a year and with a dollar in less when it 's going to find the win .
I think what you can change with vaccine vaccines in anticipating .
So , what the future might start to look like , now , now , the tree of evolution , accelling evolution with bacteria , archetc cells , archetical , , and infinally cell .
We 're so much from the improving people .
Our purpose is to do that in a way of live enough to try and do it . Thank you very much .
First of all of you will do , the most quickly possible , some fundamental work , the new technology that we took the Microsoft , following a year ago . This is Seadragon .
It 's a environment where you can interact with a local level that remote with a huge amount of data visual amount of data .
And here we 're seeing a lot of gabyte digital picture with a kind of phoom , and it 's a little bit , for a patheless , and I have images like we want .
And it doesn 't matter how much much much much of information we see , how big information is the big amount of data or images .
Most of the digital photographs , but this for example is a scanning from the Congress of Congress , and recenter in the gampieces of 300 megaxel .
It 's not any difference because the only thing that limit is a lot of the prestations of a system like this is the number of pixel on your screen in any time . It 's also a very flexible architecture .
This is a book , an interior , example of data not images .
This is Casa desolen desolate . Every colonna represents a caple .
And to show you that 's just about it , and not images , we can do something like that , to actually see that is a real real representation of the tonus , not a picture .
It could be a little artificial way to read a electronic book .
You don 't have the advice .
This is an example of the realistic example . It 's a number of the Guardian .
Every picture is the beginning of a sexiety .
And it really gives you the please of read the versus version of a magazine , or a quote , or a quote , which is for nature molectidian .
We also did something with the corner of this particular number of the Ladian .
We 've created a advertional advertioner -- much more higher than what you 're used in a normal advertis-ads advertising .
If you want to see the characteristics of this automobile , you can see here .
Or other models , or even the specific techniques .
And this really is a few of these ideas to eliminate the limits of space on the screen .
We hope that this means to put up to the pop-up , and other porcheries , not to be necessarily .
Of course , the map is one of the most obvious applications for this kind of technology .
And on this is not going to lose time , if we don 't say we have contribute to give them in this field .
These are all the streets in the U.S. sover-to-up picture picture of NASA .
So now we 're going to go with something else .
This is actually actually from the live on the Web ; you can go to see it .
It 's a project called Photosynthius , which combine two different technologies .
One is Seadragon and the other is a research visual computer computer computer in Noah Snavely , a student of Washington , with the help of Steve Seitz Rick Seitz Seitz Rick Szeliski Szi Rick Szi . An n n n . Anononountle . An a great collaboration .
And it 's from the Web , managon the Weadragon .
You can see it when we do this kind of screen , where we can move from one image , and have this kind of experience to the last multiple .
But the space collim of images here has actually a meaning .
The algorithms of visualization , in the computer , where you 're all linked together , so that they 're all skeed to the back places that I imagine -- all of all the nearly down-up . And here you see the buns of a slide -- they 're scated . Here you see the elements of a slide , or imaging paper stable , and these things are all lined to the level .
I don 't know if I have time to show you some other environment .
There are some of the most space .
I want to move directly to one of the original data set of Noahhsynthroy-prototype of Photosynthius that we 've done for the first time , so that we 've been working for the first time , to show you what I think is really the close behind this technology , the technology Photosynthroy-nth . And it doesn 't necessarily look at the same environments we put in the web .
We had to worry about the legal aspects and forth .
This is a rebuild re-built of Notre Dame images in Dame images , by Flickr , Notter Dame Flickr and you get images of type , and you get pictures of these blind cones , other bits of these conants representation is discovery , a picture of this picture that is discovery , that 's discovery , a picture of it 's discovery , that 's discovery , the picture of it is discovery .
So they 're all taken images in Flickr and they 're all linked to this way .
And it 's possible to navigate this way .
You know , I would never have to finish work for Microsoft .
It 's very gratifying to get this kind of accooks here .
I think you can see that it 's a lot of different kinds of photocameras : from those of the phones of the SLR , a meaning , a meanant number of meaning , put together in this environment .
And if I can , I try to try to those strange .
Many of them are blocked by , etc .
Somewhere you find a series of photographs -- there 's a series of photographs -- there .
This is a poster of Notre Dame recording correctly .
We can move from the poster to the poster to the view of this environment .
The essential point is that we can do things with social environment . This is now taking data from the whole memory of how to the Earth looks like the Earth , from the entire memory of view -- and connects all of view -- and connects all of the data .
All those pictures become linked together , more than the sum of the parts .
You have a whole model of the ground that emerge .
Think about this as a prolungation of Stephen Lawler on Earth Earth 's 's worldwide .
It 's something that grows in complexity , as people use it , and which advantage to people use it .
Their pictures are marked with meadapes from other people .
If you get the idea of contrast to all these sunning saying the name of the Notter , my picture of of Notter Dame improvised , you 're going to be requires of all those data , and I can use of all those data , and I can use the picture of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of kind of cross-user experience of cross-modes and cross-user experience of cross-user .
Of course , a consequence of all of this are virtual models of all interesting elaborated , the hasn 't just to live plane and enhy images , but from the colthland-memory images and similar images , but from the colthlengage .
Milles .
Chris Anderson : I realized ? What your software is going to take us to do is that at some point , in the next years , all of the next years , all of photographs are going to be practically linked from anyone in the entire world will be practically linked together ?
BAA : Yes . What 's doing is basically discover .
It 's creating hyperlink , if you want , you to have ,
And it 's doing it in the base of the images .
The thing is really interesting if you think about the receptional information information semantes that many of these images .
As when you do a research of images , you have a phrase and the text on the web page on the web picture has a lot of information about images .
Now , what if that 's going on on all your pictures ?
So the amount of semantics and the amount of receptical interconnection , it 's really huge classic . It 's a classic effect of the network .
CA : Blaise , it 's really amazing . It 's really amazing .
BAA : I thank you very .
One of the major pleasure when you travel and one of the phetnographics is that we can live between who has no forgotten forgot to the past in the wind , you know , the past in the wind , you touch out of the plants , the levert of the plants , the levert wind and loads the plants .
Baster thinking about monkeys Jaguar vidlargely , the world 's Via , or that the monitors are still collilied , or that in Himalaya , or that in Himalaya , the good good thing , or in Himalaya , to remember the central importance of the Dharm , but that the idea that the world 's not in any sense , but it 's just a model of reality , but it 's just a model ,
the consequence of a particular adaptative choices that our stypes has done , well , many generations does .
And , of course , we all share of the essential tracts .
We all all of the hidden . We all of them .
We 're subjects to start .
We have to dead death the inexorability of death , so we don 't surprising if we can dog and --
We all have a art .
What 's the particular one of the song , the rhythm of the song , the rhythm of every culture .
It 's not the people 's Penan inforests of the Borneo , or the follow of the Vodoo 's the Kaisut 's Kaisut in Kenya setty Kenya , or a settle in the heart of the Sahara .
He was my journey of journey in the desert a month ago , or a yak , in the Everest , the Everest , the Everest , the Everest , the mother of the world .
All of these populations teaches us that are other ways of exist other ways of thinking , other ways of moving in the world .
And if you reflect a second , it 's a concept that it can give you hope .
And , the myries of the world creating a ragnonote of life , creating a spiritual life and it 's important for the well-being , and it is important for the benbeing of the planet as biosphere .
And you can think about this ragnosphere , as a ethnosphere , and you can call the etnosphere is the total sum of all the concepts , dreams , ideas , inspirations , inspirations , intuitions , inspiration ,
The etnosphere is the fantastic patriage of humanity .
It 's the symbol of what we are and what we can be in how much species inquisitive .
And because the biosphere was gravously consumed , as a fast as it 's happened to the etnosphere , and it 's very quickly .
Nothing that would be a biological example , it would say that 50 percent of all species has been or is on the orlo of simply because it 's fake , or the most apocalyptic -- in the oldest of biological diversity -- and you can 't even even close to the most optimistic -- that of cultural diversity .
It 's all of that is , of course , the language persites .
When you were born 6,000 languages on this planet .
A language is not only a bunch of a series of a series of rules .
A language is the spraft of human spirit .
It 's the middle with the animal of every culture comes in the world .
Every language is a forest is a forest , a background , a thought , a ecosystem possibilities .
And of those 6,000 languages , as we 're sitting in Monterey , at least half the half of them .
They 're not teaching kids , the people who mean , not not that the thing , that 's already death .
What 's the most sad of being availed by silent , of being the last thing , of being the last talk , of you don 't have to move the sagness of the sackness of the children ?
This is a little bit of a world of someone in the world every two weeks : every two weeks , a couple of weeks , a bunch of a tonight , and a language language .
And I know someone of you will say , " Do you know ?
The world would not be a better place if you 're talking about all the same language ? " Well , we talk about yoruba . We talk to the dotonese .
We talk kogs .
You 're going to have a tract thing that means that we can 't talk about your language .
Today I 'd like to do a trip through the etnosphere --
a little trip in the etnosphere to give you a bunch of what we 're losing .
Many of us forget that when I say , " different ways of exist , I mean , different ways of exist .
Let 's take for example , Barasana , in Amazon , in Amazon , popular anaconda , who credit up the myth of sandwest in the west of latte in the west sandwest in the west of slats .
It 's a popular people who 's not able to distinguess the blue color from the verde , because the time you 're identified in the forest , which depends on the population .
They have a strange language and a matrimonial rule , called " exogamia language , " You have to tell a different language .
All of that has radical in the past mitologic past , yet the starts , which is that in these families , where they 're talking about six or seven languages , which is a language .
They just just just just listen to them .
Let 's take one of the most interesting tribes that I 've been visited , the Waorani of the North Ecuador , an amazing population that had the first contact in 1958 .
In 1957 , five missionaries have tremendous contact a practice .
They did come up with the photographs that came up with the photographs that they were reporting that this population forest , and forest that this population of pluvial forest had never seen anything bi-dimensional dimensional .
They collected the picture of the land , they 've got to research research , or a shape , or a bunch and , not find out of it , they were deal with the rate , and they killed the five missionaries with the launch .
But the Waorani doesn 't kill the southern .
They killed them between them .
The 54 percent of mortality was caused by their own .
We 're sorts of generations and we found two cases of natural morning and when we 've been recently re-inspired , they had a lot of them , and then they had an inveck , and then they killed it the same .
The caciers were able to recognize the animal .
In the early years , I 've been assigned a very interesting task when my professor of Harvard , if I wanted to go to Haiti to sweet the base of the power of Duvalier and Tonton Macool and Tonton Macooling , and dies of the veiling arly use to do the zome .
To give a sense of a miracle , I should have to understand the Vodoun culture , which Voodoo is not magic .
It 's quite a complex vision metapsics of the world .
Very interesting .
If I ask you to tell you the great religions of the world , what would you say ?
Cristianesimum , Islam , Buddhist , Ebraism , etc .
A continent is always left out , thinking that the sub-Saharan Africa has no feds of religious . And yes and the Vodoo is not the other than the distilside of these religious concepts in the tragic tragic inic , the willling of the schiavism .
What makes the interesting voodoo is the intense relationship between life and death .
So the vision they 're going to hide the spirits .
The spirites can be invoced by the Great Acqua , they say , the back to the end of the dance and they replace time time to the vive the way that for a short time to the follow .
And that 's the voodoost to say , " You white , " You white , you 're going to talk about God .
We say , we 're in the temple and say God . "
And from the moment you 're married , is the spirit that you drive , how can you do it hurt ?
So you 're seeing incredible events , following the voodoo in state of trance that touch impunts a strong demonstration , a strong strong , in the power when it 's catalyalized in a state of extreme , exciting .
In all the populations with which I 've been in the most extraordinary of the Sierra Nevada Santa Marta , in Colombia .
It was a recently civilization that once once they were living on the carais-to-board plants , the popular population of conquationy , the popular popular .
In a continent macked continent macked , this popular , this popular has never been conquisted by by the Spanish .
But they 're governmentally in the government , but their formation is so extraordinary .
The young people following the people are taken by families to three or four years , and live secreating in a world of buy and hombar in a world of buy and hombar at at the base of the glacier for 18 years .
Two da-nine years choices to reproduce the nine months of managed to reproduce the nine months of managed that they spend up in the uter of the Grande Mother .
And for all of that time , they 're acculturated to the values of their society , values that preglect the prayer and only their prayer , or to say the balance balance , or to say the balance balance .
At the end of this incredible initiation , they 're actually taken out and for the first time in their life , at the age of 18 years , they see an alone . And in that active , when the sun the sun , when the sun backyle valles of beautiful paespecially , everything they 've learned in theory . The first ball of his splector . The first thing is , which has learned in the whole splandle . The first time is saying ,
" I said , " Would you like I said .
It 's amazing . Now it 's about you protect it . "
They call them as much as the major brothers , and they say that we , the faster of the world .
This level of intuition is extremely important .
When we think about the populations and invote in the invote Rousseu and the old story of nobile , which is a concept of razens , which is a razer , or maybe invok Thoreau and say that these populations are closer to Earth .
The indeed of indebolites are not feeling by nostaly .
There 's no space for these things in the Asmallat the Asmallat or in the gelids of Tibet , but thank you to time and reach , they created a mystics of the Earth 's not about the concept of human beings .
What does that mean ?
It 's saying that a little bit of Ande who grow up up in a wild , which is a spirit of Apu who will lew his destiny , a human being destiny , and it 's going to have a different human being being a little bit different rate with the mountain that place a little bit of rocket that was a little bit of rock of rocks that mountain a rock of rocks that 's a little bit of rocks .
That 's the dimora of a spirit or a mineral , it was irrelevant .
What 's interesting is the metaphor that deep-defines the relationship between individual and the natural world .
I grew up in the forests of the Columbia credating that forests to be cut .
And that 's a different human being different from my friends Kwautl who believes that the forests are the Hukukuk and the blow historical bees of the paradise and the donibs that live in the world , spiriters that are going to be in the beginning Hamatsa .
If you start to consider that these cultures can actually create really different reality , you can start to understand some their sensational feelings . We take this plants .
I 've taken this picture of aprimp in Amazon Amazon .
Mayatheist of you have heard of ayahuasca , the most powerful psychoppertoire .
What makes it fascinating the ayahuasca is not the potential of the substance , but his elaboration . It 's composed to two elements .
On the side , this lian launch of a series of beta-carboline , harmful and harmful , and harmful , and hallucinly .
Take the only plants have a blum blum that altery a little bit of the consciousness , but it 's choice with the fleas of a family family family , Psychotrist said , Psychotridis .
This plants contains powerful , very similar to serotonin , dimethyltryptamine-5 , methoxyptamine .
If you ever see Yanomami , you 'll see Yanomami , the substance that they do by a different species , which is a methoxydimethoxtamine .
And I think that poor on the nose is a little bit like to be dissolve from a bunch of paper paints and land on a sea of electricity . [ Risate not creates a distoration destauration . It creates the dissolution of reality .
I was often , I was a lot with my professor , Richard Evan Shultes , the man who has been psychchased the psycholic fungi , with his discoveries of the fungi of the lower fungi .
And I think my aren 't going to classificate these triptamines like hallucinated because you can 't tell no one of being hallucinated . You can 't tell anyone to be sunced . They can 't be assumpted by a zyme that 's denially , because they 're dened by a zoooy-wages .
It 's possible to be at the orally only if they 're assume with other checks that denium ,
Now , it 's the beautiful carboline that are in this lian inhibit of MAO , the same type of necessary to be able to potential the trippamine . The question is the question of spontaneous , like these population , like these popular ar-like , they 're not similar , but that if you fight in this way , creating a track version ?
We use the great eupheror of the eror , which can reveal infrures .
But if we ask the Indians , they 'll say , " The plants will tell you . "
What does that mean ?
This tribes , the Cofan , 17 varieties of ayahuasca , which is not in the forest , and that 's our eyes return into the forest , and that 's our eyes would remain species .
If you ask them how they stbilishing their tassonomed , they 'll say , " I realized that I was a lot of plane , you don 't know everything ? " I said , " No . "
The solution is : you take the 17 variety of a bunch and each one will give a different sorts of gaps .
With this doesn 't have a bunch of Harvard , but it 's much more interesting than contact the stami .
Now , [ applaushes the problem is that even the problem of us that have been a heart of the popular ingenes are paintoresks , but in some way we have been paintorgins , and it beyond .
In fact , the X-century , between 300 years , it 's not going to have reminded for his guerre or innovations technologies , but rather as the one was in which we 're stopped and actively accepted , or accepted by the mass of the biological diversity and cultural culture of the planet . Now the problem is not the change .
All the cultures through the centuries were involved in a new chance of life .
And the problem is not the technology .
The Indians Sioux have no stopped to be Sioux when they put up in the arch and they 're like that Americans don 't have stopped by being in the horse and calute .
It 's not the change or technology that threats the integrity of the etnosphere . It 's the power .
The domination of the domination .
And if you give a look at the world , you 'll find that these are not destinated cultures .
They 're living and living dynamics and spints out of the existence of hyperperforming their adaptation of adaptation .
I think of disboscing in the pathries of the Penan --
a population of Sarawak , in the earth of the asian asian , a popular popular , and now reduced to a generation ago , and now reduced to the servite and prostitution on the remarkable , and you can see the fix of the baby of the lights , that seems to be able to the butter Meridiond Cinese Meridian , where the blind the bony bull illuminate ,
Woke it up to react the stones with the subtract to the forest .
Or , in the case of Yanomami , are the disease that have come with the discovery of the golden .
If we move on on the Tibet , where I 'm doing a lot of research , you 'll see the hard hard of politics .
As you know the genocide , physics of a popular popular , is constructed to universal level , but the ethnocide , the destruction of life , not only is not just convicted , but I 'll advice celebrated in certain environments , because it 's part of the development of the development .
And you can 't understand the Tibet 's suffering for the Tibet , until the beginning .
I 've been there in the 6,000 miles from Chengdu in China in China , through Tibet , coming to Lhasa young ady with a young colleague , but only came to Lhasa young colleague , but only came to Lhasa , I realized what we 're going to talk .
6,000 worlds in polluts in horried and cenjoy .
1.2 million people killed by military military during the Cultural Rivolution .
The father of this guy was ascritical at the Panchen Lama .
which means that it 's been killed by the temple of Chinese invasion .
And the uncle is in Santity in Santity in Santity that 's taken popular in Nepal .
Her mother was imprigioned and his colp was to be rich .
It 's been brought to the age of two years hidden in the age of two years , because it couldn 't live without him .
The sister , which has done the same , it was mit in reducing .
A day he inavailed a day , a wild fascinating a wild fashion , and for this transgression , it 's been mit to seven years .
The Tibet 's pain can be inhibit , but the recently spirit , but the recenter of the popular .
And finally , everything is reduces a choice .
We want to live in the world world 's polycling or we want to accover the world polycling polycling the world of diversity ?
The great anthropologue , Margaret Mead said that his biggest bigger fear was that , in our own own own view of the world , we 're not only going to see the entire gamorer of human imagination reduced , and one day , we 're going to see from a day , we 're going to get from a sleep willing .
And it 's a million million years .
The Neolitics of the Neolitica , who gave us the agriculture , which has been subject to the seed of the seed of the smop with prosa of the clero , creating the hierarchy of specialization , and we talk about 10,000 years ago .
The modern world industrialized 300 years .
That 's not about history , I didn 't suggested that we have the rispointing all the challenges that we have to deal in millennia to come .
When to these myriads of the world is asked what they 're going to say to be humans , they say , they 're responding 10,000 different voices .
And it 's in these answers that we all have the chance of being what we 're , a kind of conscious , which has to make all the population and all the given the population of the background . And there 's great moments of optimism .
I 've taken this picture of the northern extremity of Baffin , when I went to the whaled of the Inuit , and this man , Olaya , and this man , Olaya , and this man , he told me the wonderful story of his grandfather .
The down-of-year-old government has no always been given with the Inuit 's in the 1950s to stbilizes , we 've got to reach colonies .
The grandfather of this man refuted .
The family , I 'm teming for his life , and all of his life , and all his attles .
You 've got to know that the Inuit doesn 't have the cold , they can 't do it .
The pattins of slitters in origin were made of fishing skin .
The grandfather of this man didn 't have intimidnight or from the library of that man had .
It 's sgattaipitch , you have the pantalone in the skin of phocal and defecated it . When I did I do do it , they 're working creating a lama .
He spring up on the dog of this coltelevision of this coltelem , and when he became solid , he killed a dog .
It 's taken out of the dog and created a gright hauce , and he 's made a slethttty another dog and he 's disappeared on the bunch , coltellim , coltellim , coltellim , hit 's bunch of the dog .
We want to talk about cavarsely with nothing ? [ Risate ] . And this , in different ways , [ Applausi is the symbol of the resilience of the world .
In the april 1999 , the downnine has redied by the total control of an area of the bigger California and Texas I put together .
It 's the new paper . It 's called Nunut .
It 's an independent territory . They 're all the time . They do all the time .
One of the splendid example of how a natione-state can recognize with his popular .
And , to finish , I think it 's quite obvious at least who 's been in these remote song of the planet , and realizing that they 're not really remote .
For someone 's home .
They represent sexiety of human imagination that are rising to the dawn of the time . And for all of these children , like the dreams of these children , they 're part of the hope .
First , we of National Geographic , we convince that politicians will never have anything .
We think the polemies --
[ Applausi is not losound , but we believe that stories can change the world , and maybe we 're the best institution to tell the world stories . Every month of our website has 35 million visits .
156 countries transports of our television dog .
Our reviews from millions of people .
Our work is to travel the ethnosphere to bring our audience in places of beautiful cultural places that will go through the way they 've seen and , they 're hoping , above , they will be hoped , absolutely , they 're going to be a clearly , and we have to find a life style , and we have to find a life style in a world , pluralone , and we have to find a life , and multicultural world 's life in a world , and we have to find a life , and we have to find a buncut to get to get to get to get the daught our
where the wisdom of all of the populations can contributing to our benbe collective well-being .
Thank you .
I 'm going to talk to you about some things that I hope to do this book that I hope you 've heard and try to get evidence some links , in case you 're not bortails .
I would like to start with what I call the official dogma official .
The official dogma official thing ?
The dogma official official , the Western official society , the dogma official , " If we want to massive to do that is massive to do that is massive to do that is massive freedom individual freedom . "
The reason is , from one side , in fact that freedom is in itself a value , is useful , use , essential , uncious , for human beings .
Another is in fact that if we 're free , each of us can act for all of us can act for all of what massive is , no one that you 're not not not any one that you 're going to name .
The way to massive freedom is massive choice .
More choice people have , more libed , more , and more , it 's their freedom , more , they 're well-being .
This , I think , it 's so deeply round in society that nobody would have to put it in the doubt .
And it 's also deeply royed in our lives .
I 'm going to show you some examples of what progress has made possible .
This is my supermarket . It 's not particularly big .
I lose a simple note on the conditions .
In my supermarket , there are 175 conditions , without contact 10 varieties of extract , and 12 acet-to-a-to-a-to-a-shrid of the cut of the ingenious circumstance that nobody of one of the 175 proning is of your degrees .
That 's what 's the super-market .
And then you go to the near store , to buy a stereo : CD lector , radio , piaright , printing .
And in this single core , there 's a big number of audio components .
We can make six million and a half million different combinations , using the components that there are in a negoal .
You have to admit that there 's a lot of choice .
Once the world of communications .
Once , when I was a kid , you could get all the telephone services , and they were forced by Mom Bell .
He was a little bit of the phone , you didn 't buy it .
A consequence of that , between the other one , it was that the phone had never break .
These days are gone .
We have a variety of nearly illecphones , especially between the phones .
Here 's the cell phones of the future .
My favorite is that in the middle , lets of the nose , and the bune and forced the bulb and the bruling for the brulelt .
If you haven 't seen it in the store under home , you 're well certs that will be .
And what happens to the end is that people come to the negots and make this question . And you know , the answer is " No . "
It 's not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn 't do too many things .
So , in other aspects of life that are much more important than acquires of the acquiably choices .
And , in a health care : it 's not going to be in the United States that you go from the doctor and the doctor you have to do .
Instead , you go to the doctor , and the doctor says , " Well , we could do . " Or , " Ages these benefits and said , " Ages these benefits and risks . What you want to do ? "
You say , " Dotore , what should I do ? "
And the doctor says , " A has these benefits and these risks , and B has these benefits and sks . "
What do you want to do ? "
And you say , " Dotore if she was me , what would you do ? "
And the doctor : " But I 'm not . "
The result of the call of maled , " autonomous , " expression that makes it look like a beautiful thing .
But it 's not that one to move the fish and responsibility to make someone who knows something , which is the doctor , or whatever , or whatever you know -- and almost certainly maled -- and so not in the right condition to make the patient .
There 's a huge marketing of products , you 're directed to people like me and you , that if you think it 's no sense , because you can 't buy them .
But if we can 't buy them , because they have public icizes them ?
The answer is that they want to domorning , we call the doctor to ask them to be changing the rich .
What we have so fundamental as our identity is a question of choice , as you see in this jeet . " We don 't want to prove the children . "
And we can reinvent , what many times we have to do it .
which means that every morning , at the answering , you have to decide that kind of person you 're going to be .
And it was to the family and marriage , a time the common perspective , unlifeted by anyone , it was that there was the most price possible possible .
The only versus it was with who , not when , and it 's not even what to do after .
And it 's really about it .
I teach students very smart students , and I do 20 percent of the work .
And it 's not because they 're not not because they 're not not because they 're not not because they 're good .
but why are I impensierites , I mean , I would you say , " Do I would you have to do that now ? "
" Do I have to tell me later ? I have to think before you go to the children or career ? "
They 're interrogative logorants .
And they 're looking for the answer to these questions , even if this impliation is not to do the companies that assume , and not getting a bel vote to my examples .
And they have to do that . They 're important questions .
Now , the work : we 're lucky , like Carl was , because the technology allows us to work every day , from every day , from every corner of the planet , transformer from the Hotel Randolph .
And there 's a little angle , there 's a angle , and I won 't tell anyone , where where the WiFi works .
I don 't tell you , because I want to use it .
What does this mean , this incredible freedom of choice that we have to do about work ? It 's going to continue in every moment , if we have to work or not .
We can go to see our son player , with the cell phone , with the cell phone in one pockberry , and the notebook , and the notebook , typically , on the ginochia .
And even if they 're all spent , every minute we see our son , we 're also asking the game , we 're also asking , " Do I have to answer this call ? "
" I have to answer this email ? I have to get this literal letter ? "
And even when the answer is " no , all of this makes the experience of your son 's game , very different than what it would have been in other conditions .
So , as we look at all , small and big materials , objects and life , life is a question of choice .
Once the world was this : Ovreal , there were some possibilities , but everything was a question of choice .
The world of today looks like this : The dilemma is , " Is it a positive thing , or negative ? "
The answer is Same : The answer is Same .
We all know , the positive latest latest ones .
All this choice is two effective , two effective effective , people .
The first , paradoxtioning , it 's that it 's a lot of liberation .
With a lot of options between which choose , it 's very difficult to do it .
I offer you an example : a meaning of pindication .
A connected of a link had access to the SSSSSydigantic society , with about a million clients of pink , with about a million clients .
What she turns out that it 's that for every 10 solutions that are offered in more , the percentage of adesion , two percent .
With 50 source source , there 's 10 percent of adhhesions than when they 're available to only five . Why ?
Because with 50 source source between which choose , is maledtely difficult to decide , and choice is remainly difficult to the tomorrow .
And to wonder , and again , tomorrow , tomorrow , and of course , I would never come .
You know , it doesn 't only means that these work from old work for the old old old old , because they 're not going to say that the decision is so ostics that allow the decision is so ostics that allow the birthday of the dator of work .
It 's not participating , they 're losing until five , six dollars a year from the workers of work , which would be bony .
So the paralysis is a consequence of having too many choices .
And I think it makes the world that .
" And to finish , for the ethernity : ketchup , send or maionese ? "
You would say you 're just taking the right decision , if it 's for ethernity , right ?
You don 't want to choose the wrong wrong , and you can 't have to choose .
So that 's the first effect . The second is that we also can avoid parality and do a choice , at the end we 're less , we 're absolutely satic .
And this for different reasons .
One of these is that with many of those are that choose , if you buy one , and it 's not perfect , it 's easy to imagine that you could do a different choice that would be better . And that 's what happens to be better . And that 's that the alternative inspiring us of choice , and the replacement replacement of choice , and the replacement of the choice , and the replacement of the soddisfying ,
And when it was a good decision .
More choice , there 's more easy . You 're just dislilifetime that 's insophisting of option .
And , there 's what economists call to expensive opportunity .
Dan Gilbert has close very well stamatin the value of things that we 're going to depends on what we 're confronted .
And , when there are many options , when there are a lot of options , it 's easy to represent the active characternative arrow and be less soddaunting .
Here 's an example . I 've been with all of the ones that are not New York .
But that 's what you probably think you 're going to have .
There 's this copy of the Hampons .
A lussian place .
It 's all about splendida . It 's all for them . It 's all for them .
Not nothing . But what he thinks is , " Well , malaria , maling , it 's Agotten . "
" All my neighbors in Manhattan is . "
" I could talk about it just in front of you home . "
And it 's two weeks , you 're going to go up -- every day -- every day -- the opportunity to talk to where it wants .
The opportunity deminuble deminuous opportunity to what we have , as well as choice is excellent .
And the options we have to consider , more , the most of the attractive characteristics will report to us as expensive .
Here 's another example .
This is a lot of things .
It 's about the world 's time , and maybe live in slowly .
But the most important point is that you 're going to do , you 're not doing other .
The things that we don 't choose to be active attractive , which can make less attract what we do .
And third point : The spiral of the expectations .
I tried it on my skin buying a new couple of jeans .
I 'm going to be jeans .
Once the jeans were just a type , and they were bought , they were unbey-up , they were only after they were shown them a life and work a lot of times , they began to go well .
So I went to buy a couple new when the old old old who had gone , and I said , " I need a couple of jeans , this is my cut . "
The commit said , " Looodies want to do , and the phit ?
And you want to do with the cernier with the bottons ? " Stonehed , " Halye ?
" Look like , the latest looks like ? "
" Seight them to them or stretch ? Bil bla bla -- " Contint was going to get it .
I was sent sites , and after a little bit , I want the guy that -- that was the only guy , " You know , " Do you know , " Do you all the jeans , and then I tried to all jeans , and then I 'm used to say , " I want to know all the jeans .
It was the massive . I had the best .
But I felt I was worse .
Why ? I wrote a whole book for understood it .
The reason I was worse is that with all of that choice is that with all of the expectations were very perfect .
I was the beginning I had expectation . I didn 't waiting for anything that there 's just a guy , but when I live live live 100 different , steps , close , at least one guy had to be perfect .
What I had to buy was good , but it 's not perfect .
After I was talking about the chosen with what I was trying to do , I was insodded in confronted .
The add of options in life doesn 't do that increase the expectations that these have respect to the excellent options .
And this will be less satifation , even when the result of it is good .
Nobody in the world of marketing , if you realize .
because if they knew it , you would not know what I 'm talking about .
The truth of the truth .
" He was better when you were worse . " The reason that he was better when he was worse was worse , when he was worse was worse , you can meet the surprised .
The world we live in the world we live -- opulent , industrialized citizens with expectancy -- the massive that we can hope is that things that things are at the alteness of expectations .
You 're never surprised to be surprised because your expectations , my expectations , they 're ingantic .
The secret of happiness -- what you 're here -- it 's , " Baswaiting . "
I mean , small , the careographic moment -- that I 'm really married and my wife is really amazing .
I couldn 't do it , I couldn 't do , I didn 't acked it .
But it 's not always a bad thing .
And finally , a consequence of buy pair , which is that when you have just that kind of jeans is that when you 're not satissssatic , and you ask , " Why ? "
Who 's responsible ? " , the answer is close .
The world is responsible . What can you do ?
When there are hundreds of kinds of jeans , and buy a bought a unlike , and you ask you who is the responsible , it 's the clear that the responsible you .
You could do better .
With hundreds of variety available , there are no use for the insuccess .
So when people take decisions , even if the result is , they feel insophisted , they feel insoddisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdiscut .
In the last years , the depression is explode in the world .
I think a significant factor -- I don 't only have the only one , but important -- of this honate depression is that people have a delusion of the people have been too high .
And when they have to explain this situation , they think that cold is their colp .
So the final result is that in general , objectively , but we feel worse .
Let me remember you .
This is the official dogma , what we all take for good and it 's completely fake . It 's not true .
There 's no doubt that a little bit of choice is better than I have no business , but it 's not that much better than any of this .
There 's a critical value , magic . I don 't know what it is .
But I 'm sure we 've been super-scale , the level where the level of choices are improved by a piece of the level that choices to our life .
Now , from the political point of view -- I 've almost finished -- from the political point , the noction is the following .
What allows all this choice in the industrial society is the wealth of material .
There are many places in the world , and you know , you know , where the problem is not that they have a choice .
The problem is that they have too pop .
So the factory I 'm talking about is a malbeing exclusive , re-several society .
And what he does to depress and climbing is this : Steve Levitt Levitt talked about how much those expensive and discoveries of baby . It 's a sprec of money .
I mean that these choices , complicated and available , it 's not that they just use .
I 'm untough deleteries .
They 're worse .
If a little bit of what in our society allows , it 's reversed in those where people have too pool to be , it would not just be their life to improve , but also .
That 's what economists call a parety-to-like improvement .
A redistribution redistribution is good for all of -- not only to poor -- because of this choice in excess that we get .
And you can be like , " You can become everything you want to do . "
You , you 're going to think , " What does that fish ?
" It 's obvious that you can 't make anything in a glass . "
" A imagination castrated , a limited vision of the world --
and I 've got the interpreted so , at the beginning .
But then , I realized that , instead , I realized that that fish is the long one .
Because the reality of the fact is that if you mands up the bock , so that you can 't get the freedom . You get the paralysis .
If you break the box in a way that everything diving possible diminures .
You can get it up , and you 'll reduct the well-being .
Everybody needs a sphere .
This is almost certainly too much , maybe even in fishing for fish , and certainly for us .
But the absolutely symbolic symbolic , is a recipe for infeless .
Thank you very much heart .
