Last year , I showed these slides to show that the glacial calott-glacial calottica , which is almost three million years had the size of 48 United States .
But this subvalute the gravity of the problem because it doesn 't show the spent of the problem because it doesn 't show the spent of the ice .
The arctic glacial calotter is , in a sense , the clean is a clean , the heart of the global climate system .
It 's going to be up and retired .
The next slide will be a quick carried to be a quick carried on the last 25 years .
The glaces are reported in red .
As you see , you 're expanded to the wall .
That 's the ice in the winter , which is ritions of extreme .
You can see that the cosidamage , five years or more , is like blood , which is like blood , which is as blood , which is as a blood .
In 25 years , it 's been there , in 25 years ,
This is a problem because the heaving heat at the ground of the ice ice ice of the arctic around the ocean where there are huge amounts of carbon congelated that , leaves , are transformed in the microbes .
I 'm going to go to totality of the atmospheric , that amount of of global warming , could double , overcome this point of not return .
In some , a little bit profound in Alaska a metane is already rebolling on the water .
The professor Katey Walter of the University of Alaska was a team pressed blow on a team in the last winter .
Video : Wow ! Al Gore : Wow . You know , and the question is if we also have it .
And that 's why this is the termal exchange the Groenland from the northermal .
This is a glacial regime .
And he had never reached levels of that .
This is the Kangerlussuaq , in the southwest of the Groenland .
If you want to know how the sea level of the sea for the sea of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the sea .
These running out of the current .
The other side of the planet : Antarctica , the largest block of the planet .
The month last month scientists have dichied that the bilannose is in negative , and that the West Antarctica , which poges on some issun . It 's particularly rapid to the month .
It 's a six feet of the miles of the acque , like Groenland .
Himalaya , the third largest block of ice , you see new laghi , which is a few years ago , which is a glaciers .
40 percent of the population is going to be half of the world 's population .
Sulle Ande : this glacier is the source of the potaable water .
The brought is increased .
But when you decrease , the same happens to the water water .
In California , the nenow on Sierra Nevada is deminuity .
The kidrices are in crisis .
The predictions , as you 've read , are good .
The growing safity in the world leads to a remarkable of inceness .
The environmental disasters are increasing a rhythm outside of the normal and without previous .
Four times more numbers in the last 30 years , which I have been reverted .
This is a whole thing that is insustainable .
If you look at the context of the historical context , you can see the consequences .
In the last five years , we added 70 million tons of CO2 every 24 hours -- 25 million tons in the ocean every day .
Look at the area of the oriental Pacific , and the American American American , to the walk into the parts of the substant ina royal oxygen in the ocean .
The major because of global warming , and the deforestation , which is 20 percent , is the fossil fuel use .
The oil is a problem , and the carbon is even worse .
The United States are one of the two countries with more emissions , together to China .
And it was proposing to build a lot of other carbon .
But we 're seeing a way of a direction .
These are the projects in the last few years and some green proposes of alternative .
And every way , there 's a political lost in our country .
The carbon industry and the oil have spent 250 million dollars in the last year to promote carbon , which is a oxide , which is a oxymold .
And that image , I would reminded me something --
Natal , in Tennessee , where I live , there was a loss of 3.8 billion lithons .
Maybe you 've seen it on the news .
This is the second largest flowing in America .
It 's happened around Natale .
The nalist ads of one of the carbon industry was this .
Video : Srosty the carbon is a kind of allegro and happy .
It 's abundant here in America , and it 's growing our economy .
Frosty carbon is more and cleaning .
It 's good price , and it 's working and work , they keep the stypend .
Al Gore : At here is a lot of the West Virginia .
The biggest minerair society on the mountain is Massey Coal . This is his administrator .
Video : Don Blankenship : At Al Gore , Nancy Pelosy Peloses , Harry Reid -- they don 't know what they 're talking about .
Al Gore : So the Alleance for the Clima Protext has launched two campaign .
This is a one of them , a part .
Video : Acore : Acore COALergy : ALergy , and we have a tiny tiny to our business .
So , our priority is to invest a great amount of money in a bunch of public and confused to make public and confused the truth .
In fact , coal is not spored .
We think it 's clean -- it 's also a good profum .
So , not preocupatate of the climate change .
Let me do it .
Video : Ater , Carbone : Carbone -- you heard a lot of .
So let me go around a structure to a turn into a structure to the avaning of the puly-lit .
Straordinary ! The machines are a little rumorous , but this is the sound of the technology of coal .
The carbon consumption is between the main causes of global warming , but the remarkable technology of coal , but the technology of the pullic-lit technology that you see changes everything .
Date a look : this is the odierglass technology .
Al Gore : Finally , the positive positive is connett to cheap and the national security .
Video : The America is in crisis ; the economy , the national security , the national security .
The file that we all of the fossil fuel , and our dependence of fossil fuel , like carbon fuel and oil practice .
Now , but , there 's a new , audace ,
Repower : 100 percent of clean energy , in ten years .
A plan to reput America to work , make us sure more , and help to stop the global warming .
Finally , a solution that is to solve our problems .
Repower . Scoprite more .
Al Gore : This is the last .
Video : How to return to America .
One of the fastest ways to bring to the dependence of the combustible that will kill our planet .
Sunce : The future is here . Vent , a new energy network .
Nooi investment : Negi investment for a bunch of work .
Comment : Repower . It 's time to be realists .
Al Gore : A old proverbio .
If you want to go back , you go together . "
We have to go back , faster .
Thank you very much .
LHC . Last year at TED , I 've got a introduction on LHC .
And it promise to come back to how the machine works .
So here I was here . And for the other time , there was no , the LHC is the largest scientific experiment ever tried -- 27 kilometers of circumsted .
His task is to rerereturn the conditions that were at least of a billion billion , from the beginning of the universe -- until 600 million times a second .
And that 's just ambiitious .
This is the machine in Ginevra .
We 're going to take these min-Big Bang in the relevening .
This is what I work . It 's called ATLAS -- is large-foot diameter , and it 's a diameter .
This is a spectacular picture of ATLAS , building so you can see proportions .
To10 of the last year , we have acceso the machine for the first time .
And this picture was taken by ATLAS .
It was because of immense festeggiving in control .
It 's a picture of particles who had done all the way around the LHC , entering , entering in collision , deliberately , with a part of the LHC , and spread particles inside the remarker .
In other words , when we see that image 10 writing , we realized that the machine was working , which is a great witory .
I don 't know if this was going to be exultar , or this , when someone went on Google and vies that the page was this .
That means we have had a cultural impact on the scientific impact .
It 's a week later , there was a problem with the machine , just to these file here -- these fixed blocks .
These file file 13,000 amping when the machine works at the massive .
Now , the technicians in you will look at the physics and say , " It 's not true . I 'm physics too much . "
And they can do it because when they 're very cosiddetti saughed by the way .
So , at least 271 degrees , at least 271 degrees , and they can bring that run .
In one of the juntures of the most novemile in the LHC , there was a fect fect defect .
So the file , they surrounding , and the 13,000 to make improvisely met a electrical resistance .
This was the result .
Now , this is more impressive if you think that these magneti fish , and that you 've been moved about 30 cents , and that you 've been moved about 30 centimeters .
They are damage about 50 magneti .
We had to take them , what we did .
We restinated them and traveled them .
They 're now now coming back all of their subground .
By the end of the third LHC is going to be again integral .
We 're going to access it , and we 're expected to get to the data or the luly , and we keep our adventure to find what are the morning is that they 're in the morning that are the universe .
Now , of course , of course , these accidents return the debate on the value of science and engineering the value of science and engineering in front . It 's easy to confuture .
I think the fact that it 's so hard , the fact that it 's the value of things like LHC .
I want to end with the words of a English scientist , Humphrey Davy , which , I imagine , in defense of inuseful experiments of his pupille , his pupille was Michael Faday , said , " Nient Faday , he said , " Nithing that the reencies of the human mind as the rinely reencountered , which we don 't have a new monade .
Thank you .
I want to start asking you to rethink about when , kids , you play with the morning on the morning .
While you understand how you get them and get them , and get them , and you 're going to move them and get them , you know , and you know , and solve problems and manipulating the relationships .
The space reasoning is deeply connected to the way we understand a lot of the world around us .
So , from the information usually inspired by the usulity of our physical objects , together to my consulent Pactor , and my collaborator Jeevan Kalanithi , I started asking , " And if , when we use a computer , we just have the cursor of the mouse as a pollyer , we could actually deal with your hands on a desktop , we could deal with your hands , and I 'm going to be a a computer ,
and how would it to do it ?
The question was so interesting that we decided to do to explore the answer , building the Siftable .
In a few words , a Siftable computer is a great interactive computer as a biscoscoscope .
In a few words , a Siftable computer is a great interactive computer as a biscoscoscope .
You can move with the hand , they can see " between them , " and they can see " and they have a screen and a screen and a screen and a radio wireless .
But most importantly , they are physical objects , like the morning , you can just be able to be able to erandle erandle .
The Siftable is the example of a new ecosystem of tools to manipulate digital information .
And as they become more physical , consciousness , and as they become more physical , and as they become more physical , consciousness , and we can explore and different estyle , and we can explore and different estyle and different estyle of interaction .
I 'm going to start with some simple example .
This Siftable is configured to show the video : if you 're going to hold the video , it will road on a direction , video , it will road on the other side .
These interactive rats are aware of the other .
If you affianing them , they 're interested in what they 're around .
If they 're surrounded , they can see it and they can do it .
If they 're surrounded , they can see it and they can do it .
They also have their movement and inlination .
And then we realized that one of the interesting implications of the interaction was to be able to use managed to the data , for example , " a color , " we 're going to be a liquid .
In this case , we have three Siftable configurate as a bunch band , I can use them to the color in that central , where they mix .
and I can use them to the color in that centries , where they mix .
If we 're too too much , we can get a little bit of a place .
There are also beautiful possibility of learning , like language , and the mathematics and logic games where people can try things very quickly , and see the results of the midly immediately .
Now , I 'm --
This is a Fibonaccount that I do with a equations of equations .
Here we have a words that 's a half a words that 's half Scareo and Boble .
Pratically , at every turn-re-one letter , Pratically , at every Siftable , Pratically , every Siftable , and while you 're looking for words , and while you 're looking for words , and while you 're looking for a devictionary words , and you know , and you know , you 're going to be able to do with words .
Then , after about 30 seconds they remischieve , and you have a new letter set of reading and new possibilities to try .
Thank you .
Here 's the children came to the glows in Media Lab , I did so that I tried them and I turned a video .
They are very liked .
And one of the interesting things that kind of applied is that you don 't have to give people a lot of instructions .
You just say , " Compons of words , and they know exactly what to do .
Here 's here to other people who try it .
This is our beta younger header , there on the right .
It actually wanted to do it .
They only were morning ,
Now , this is a appliation of a interactive chart .
We wanted to build a tool for the apprentice for the Lui language is Felix .
It can put in the scene , in the snail , and they 're associated .
It can put in the scene , in the snail , and they 're associated .
So , here 's , he 's doing the sun .
Video : The sun is smile .
David Merrill : Now , she took a treat the scene .
Video : The arange haningly .
Bel work !
So , you know , Siftable and put them close to interact the characters --
Video : Bau !
-- inventing your story .
Video : Hi !
DM : It 's a story with the final , and it can decide him how you 're going to be going to do .
DM : It 's a story with the final , and it can decide him how you 're going to be going to do .
Video : Vola .
DM : The last example I have time to show you is a tool , and to do it is a recently , to sample and execececectous music .
It 's a tool , you know , recently , to sample and make music .
The Siftable here are act as a basic , based and the bacteria .
Each of these has four different variations , and you can choose what to use .
You can also put these sound in a sequence of comporing to your pleasure .
And it just just by making a fabove a sune and a sequence . "
These are actually actually actually , you can control from the vial , like the reverber and the filter .
It 's attacks to a particular sound and then inclens for them .
And then there are the general effectively as time and volume , which is applied by the way .
Let 's look at how it works .
Video : We 're going to start making a basic basic in Siftable sequence , we can put it in a series , we put it in a series , we add the other basic .
Now I put a bottom line .
Video : DM : Now , add the percussions --
Video : DM : And now I 'll put the filter to the bacteria , so I can control the effect .
Video : I can be able to be able to be able to sequence the intersequence on the other .
Video : DM : And now , I 'm going to add the bottom to give more expression .
Video : I can recombine the sequence of the flight .
So I don 't have to do it before , but I can improvising , making it longer or the shortly .
And now , finally , I can spend the whole sequence on the left . The Siftable on the left Siftable .
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is to build new interfacuuum machine and more and more sounds like our brain and body .
And today , I had time to show you one of the results of this path , and also some chance we try to get out of the lab .
The concept I want to get to you is that it 's coming to this new generation of designed to interact with digital media , which will take information in our world in the way we want .
Thank you very much .
I don 't see the time to talk to all of you .
I 'm a writer .
And I 'm going to be books is my profession , but it 's more than this , of course .
It 's also love and the fascination of my life .
And I don 't expect that it can change .
But , he said this , something particularly happened to my life and in my career , which has brought me to replace to me the whole thing .
The particular thing is that I recently wrote this book , this whography called " Mangia , Prega , Ama , " which , diversly from my previous books , for some reason came out in the world and became a great feelational , besttional , besttile .
And the result is that everywhere , people treat me as if you were convicted .
It 's true -- conconconvicted ,
They 're going to be all worried and they say , " Do you don 't have fear to do better ?
Do you don 't have fear to continue to write the whole life without being able to create a book that can be able to create a book that can be able to be someone ? "
that can be importance to someone ? "
It 's certainly , you know .
But it could go worse , part of the one reminme that I was more than 20 years ago , when I began to tell people -- I was a writing .
I was going to go to the same reaction .
And people said , " Don 't you could not do it to be successful ?
Do you don 't know that the umillion reflights .
Do you don 't do this to walk up and all life and die on a life , and to die on a cue of dreams with the mouth of a pile of dreaming with the mouth to lead to lead to the failure the wildlife ? "
So , you know , you know .
The answer -- the short answer to all these questions is , " Yes . "
Yes , I 'm fear to all of those things .
I 've always had fear .
And I also fear to many other things that people may not have to stand .
As the algae and other things .
But , for how to write what I thought and I 'd like to say , and I would say , and I would say , "
Is it rational ?
It 's logical that anyone who has been waiting to be spent by a work that you 've been born to do .
But what is that 's so particularly in the creative and make us nervous of the mental health .
How my father , for example , he was a chemical engineer and not remember one time in his 40 years of activity that he was asked if he was asked if he was a fear to be able to be capita ?
There was never -- that was that block to engineer John , how does it go ?
It didn 't work that , you know ?
Onestly , chemicals as they don 't have certainly , in the centuries , drivers the reputation of being alcolized .
We have been writers , we have enough to do this reputation , and not just writers , we have this reputation of being enormous .
And it 's not to look at the sad of the deaths of the magnificments of the magnificments that , only in the 2th century , they die young and often for their hand .
And the ones that don 't have been suicide to be really disfaced by their dunes .
Norman Mailer , before he died , in the last interview said , " Every book , " Every book , and he killed me a little more " an extraordinary affermonation about the work of your life .
But we don 't get it up , when we hear that , because we 've heard these things so long that we 've been completely interiorized and accepted the notion that creativity and suffering are in some way , and that art , at the end , it will always be a shake and that art , at the end , it will always be a shake .
And the question I want to take all of here today is : you agree with this idea ?
It 's good this -- because it also looks at this , and it 's a centimeter of a distance to me , it 's good for nothing .
I think it 's odious .
And I think it 's dangerous and I don 't want to see the perpetuated in the next century .
I think it 's better to encourage our big creative minds .
And I surely to my case -- in my case -- in my situation -- it would be very dangerous to start fuse to that wish ball of suppoison , especially date circumstances where I 'm in my career .
It 's true -- I mean , you know , they 're pretty young , I have about 40 years .
I still have about four decades of work in me .
And it 's very likely that everything I 'm going to be judged by the world as the work that was used to be judged after the success of my last book .
I 'm going to be slavery , because we are all more or less friends here -- it 's likely to my great success is to my shoulder .
Oh , Gesus , who thought !
You know this is the kind of thought that leads a person to start to becoming back to the nine of the morning and I don 't want to do it .
I would like to keep doing this work that we love .
So , the question is it , how ?
And so it looks , after a lot of reflective , which the way to work to continue to be writing is to create a psychological construct , right ?
I have to find a way of security disafety between me , which I 'm writing , and my natural anxial anxial , which reaction is going to be able to get it . And , while I was trying to find other societies to see if they could have to be better ideas and more healthy and make a societies of how to be able to see if they could have to have some better ideas and more and sane and make unless and more healthy and make it out of the societies to see if they could see if they
about how to help people creative to manage people who are motional to do the emotional risks .
And that research took me to the ancient Grek and the ancient Rome .
Heguitem , because I 'm giving in circle and then back .
In the ancient Grek and ancient Rome -- people didn 't seem to believe that creativity was in men , OK ?
And it was thought that creativity was this spirit to be and that came to men from a few people distant and unknown , for distant distant reasons and unknown , for reasons and unknown .
The Great was called these spirites were called the demon .
Socrate , wonder , he believed to have a demon that elargives sague from a distant .
The Rooms were the same idea , but they call that kind of spirit species .
which is great , because the Rooms didn 't think that a genius was particularly cleaned .
They believe that a genius was this kind of divine entity that was literally in the walls of a artist , a little bit like the elpho Dobby , and they come out to be there to be a little bit of the work of the artist and models the work of the artist and models the result of that work .
Here 's what you 're going to -- that 's the distance of which I talk about -- that psychological construct that you protects you from your work .
And they all knew that was how it worked , right ?
So , the anti-artists were protected to certain things , like , for example , the too much narcible , no ?
If your work was exceptional , you couldn 't take all the place , you could all know that the deserve , they all know that the herself .
If your failure , it was not all your failure , right ?
Everybody knew that was your genius to be a inable .
And so , people han conceived creativity in Occcient for a long time .
Then the Renciement came and all changed , and it changed this great idea ; we put the human center of the universe on the center of the universe on the top of the universe and the mysteries and without leaving space creatures that wrote from divinity .
This was the principle of humanity , and the people began to think that creativity was completely from the hydgen .
And for the first time in history , you start to refer to this or that artist as a genius rather than a genius .
And I have to tell you , I think was a big mistain .
I think that I let somebody , a simple person to believe that they 're like a recipient as a source , the essence and the source of all the mysteries , creatives , unknowable and etheres is a very much of the human physical responsibility .
It 's like to ask someone to enjoy the sun .
Deform and deforming and destand completely creates all these things expectations on performance .
And I think it was this pressure that I was destroyed to the artists in the pass .
And if this is true , and I think that it 's , and now ?
Can we do that diversity ?
Maybe you can get back to a more comprehension of the relationship between humans and creative mystery .
Or maybe not .
Maybe we can 't get 500 years of rational thinking about 500 years .
And there 's probably people in the audience that would be legitimed to scientific sospicians on the notion of , you know , they follow the next to their projects .
It 's probably not really convince you all about this thing .
But the question I want to bring is -- why not ?
Why don 't you think about this way ?
Because it 's more sense of everything that I 've ever heard to explain the imprevedibility of the creative process .
A process that , as anybody who ever tried to do something -- so , basically , all here -- you don 't know , you don 't compored .
And , in fact , it can sometimes be completely paranormous .
I did this meet Ruth Stone , who has now 90 years , who has now 90 years , but he was a poetry for the whole life and said that during his life and said that in his childhood , and he was working out in the rural Virginia , he was in the walk , and he was in the middle .
He said he was like a fragorous tracy .
And that was rotoling to her landscape .
He felt it , and he was going to get the land under his feet .
He knew he had one thing to do to do that point and it was , and then , her to run as a mart . "
And so it 's going to be home and come up with this poetry , and it would not have to have to get a piece of paper and a cymity , and a pretty quickly , and they would reach it and ererit on the page .
Sometimes he couldn 't be enough to be enough , so it would correcve and correcreceive and the rotoling and the rotolar and she would continue to reach through and she lost and she loved and she would continue to reach through the landscape , and she would continue to be able enough . "
Then there was those times -- this piece of time , I 'm going to never -- there were a moments where the was almost losing , OK ?
So , he was running home and she was trying to card and the poetry was going through , and he was going to be a married , and then said , which was how if you 're sat with the other hand and steffed .
It was coda and he would remain the coda and remain his body and transclued it on the page .
And in these cases , the poetry would be presented on the perfect page and the last word to the contrast , and the last word to the first .
So when I heard it -- it 's crazy , it 's exactly the same thing that was equal to my creative process .
Not all my creative process -- they 're not a construction .
I 'm a mulo , and my way to work on is ; you know , wake up to the same orary every day and work and go on the gotten .
But even me , in my heada-, I 've striped against that thing , sometimes .
And I think that also many of you the han .
You know , even though the work and ideas came to me from a certain source , you can 't honestly know .
And what is this thing ?
And how can we relate it to it in a way that we don 't lose your head , but , rather , that , what do you remain san ?
And as I 'm about , the best example , I have is the best example I have the musician Tom Waits , which I interviews different years ago for a newspaper .
We were talking about this , and you know , Tom , for the majority of life is recently recently , and then you know , and to control these species , and to make these species of impulses , and domining these species of impulses .
But then he was going to get , and he was driving on a road in L.Angeles , he changed all over a way to Los Angeles , changed everything for him .
It was going to be fast and all of a traits of the melodia , which comes in his head as inspiration , and it comes in his head as inspiration , and the okay , you know , it 's wonderful , and the desider , but it 's not knows how to take it .
It has no card , it 's not a piece of paper , it has no register .
So he begins to hear this old species of old , and I 'm going to be able to lose , and I 'm going to lose , and I 'm going to be obsessed by this song .
I 'm not good enough and I can 't do it . "
And instead of going to go to the panic , and he 'll stop .
He was going to be the whole whole process and made something completely new .
And he just just just just the sky and said , " Scell , you know I 'm driving ? "
" Do you think it can write a song now ?
If you really want to exist , you 're going to get me care of you .
And then , you go to importantly something else today .
You 're going to disturbing Leonard Cohen . "
And his process has changed this process .
It was not the work , the work was still dark .
But the process , and the fish , and the fish , and the fish , the genius was require , the genius that was out of him , and the genius that was going to be remain it back where it was , realized that he had no interized .
But you know this peculiar , wonderful bizarre collaboration between Tom and this strange and this strange and external thing that was not Tom .
So , how I heard that story began to change a little bit of the way I was working and I 've already saved me .
This idea , I was saving when I was writing " Mangia , Prega , and falls in one of those waving cave of the disperation where we all of when we 're working on something and we can 't think that it will be a disaster , which is going to be the worse book .
Not just good , just the worst book written .
And I started thinking about this project .
But then I remembered to me of Tom who was talking to the air and I tried to me .
So I stand up my face on the wild and I return my comments to a vacuum of the room .
And I said to high voices , " Sologist , what , both we know that if this book is not going to be brilliant , no ?
Because as I see you 're putting all I have , I don 't have this .
So if you want to be better , you have to presented you and do your part .
OK . But if you don 't do it , you know what , I don 't do it .
I 'm going to write the same because it 's my work .
And I want to favor that was recorded that I was presented to do my part , " because -- finally , OK -- it 's so , OK -- they 're in the deserts of the North Africa , the people would date and sacred and music that they were going to go on and sacred and to the dances that were going on and hours to the dawn .
And they were always magnifeted , because the ballerins were great and they were great .
But every long , rarely , something happened , and one of these artists was really really transcendent .
And I know what I know , because I know you all of what you 've seen , at a certain point , a performance so .
It was like the time , and the dancing time , and the dancing walked through a kind of labor and was doing nothing else from the solimite , and it was all there .
And suddenly , not just as a human .
But it 's accentioned from the divinity in the winter of the divinity .
And when this happened , when this was , the people knew what was , they called him .
They were conged their hands and began to dotar , " Allah , Allah , God , " God , God , " God , " God , "
That 's God , you know .
And the historical note -- when the Mororge Minvases , I was this abitude with their and pronounce changed in the centuries , and they 'll change in the centuries , Allah , Allah , Allah , " Ole , you can still hear in the corrids or in the floor .
In Spain , when a artist did something impossible and magic , " Allah , " Allah , " Allah , " I was , " incomprerehrensible , it , it 's a last of God .
And it 's great because we need .
But , the problem comes the day , and the dancer , and the dang up , and discover that are 11 in the morning of Martedday and the last of God 's morning and the last of God .
It 's just a mortal mortal with gran bad , and it 's maybe it 's going to be able to get that altel to that altel altness .
And maybe nobody will you have the name of God still while yellow , and what do you have to do with the rest of the life ?
It 's hard .
This is one of the most paining recognizations to do in a creative life .
But maybe it doesn 't have to be so much if you can 't believe , and you can 't believe , and in fact , and the most extraordinary aspects of your being from yourself .
But you would just believe that that they 're going to be a unimaginable source of this team that you have to go to someone else when you finished .
And , you know , if we think that in this way , it 's all changes .
And so I started thinking about , and it 's certainly how I thought I think about a different time for the book that I 'll be going to help me soon , the dangerous , attesissue , attesissue , and we 've been followed my my great success success .
And what I have to continue to me when I feel electired by this is , it 's not fear .
It 's not just your work . It 's just your work .
It 's going to present you for your side , any can be .
If your work is dancing , ball .
If the divine , I listen to you , and it 's just just just a few kind of wonderful , for one moment through your efforts , then you know , " Ole ! "
And you have to do that your dance .
And " Ole ! " at you yourself .
I think and I think , and I have to teach it .
" Ole ! " at you , even only for the human love and heada-text tal winds to make you continue .
Thank you .
Thank you .
June Cohen : Ole !
As you know , I 've already talked about some of these projects on what can mean and the discovery of new new set of genes .
Now we 're starting a new path : we started to digitalize biology and now we 're going to start to digital code are entering in a new phase of biology , designing and design and synthize life .
We 've always been trying to take great questions .
" What is life ? " is something that many biologists have tried to understand vary vary of levels .
We 've tried different approaches , reduced it to the minims .
We 're digitizing from almost 20 years .
When we sequenced the human genome was being being about to go from the analogical world of the digital world .
Now , we ask , can we , can we regenerate life , or create new life from this digital universe ?
This is the map of a small organism , Mycoplasma genitalium , which is the smallest genome between those who can authorem in the lab .
And we tried to reduce the genome to create a little bit more .
We can get a hundred genes of genes of about 500 that are here .
But when we look at his metabolic map , it 's relatively simple than our .
And he thought me , this is simple .
But when we look at all the genes that we can eliminate , one at the time , it 's very unlikely that this can bring a living cells .
So we decided that the only way to progree to be synthize this chromosoma in a way to get to get some of these fundamental questions .
And so we started the adventure of the " can we " can we " "
Can you get to make these big molecules that we never have been able to create these big molecules that we never had to create before ?
And , in case , we can we make a chromosoma ?
A chromosoma is just a piece of chemical material .
The speed with which we 're able to digitalize life is growing to report the life is growing up .
Our ability to write the genetic code , instead , progret , but it 's improving .
And our most recent results the results to a curve curve .
We 've got over 15 years ago .
The process of required , and starting with a biothetic revision before we began to the first experiments .
But we found that synthesize DNA is very difficult .
There are tens of thousands of cars in the world that produce small segments of DNA , long , long , and it 's a degenerative process : the most of the segment is longer , there are .
So we had to develop a new method to assemble these framments and correct the errors .
And this was our first attempt , particularly , particularly digital genome of Phi X 174 .
It 's a small virus that kills .
We 've been designed the fragments , effective the correction of the errors and get a molecule of DNA about 5,000 lectargument .
The interesting part is when we took this piece of chemical chemical material , and we put it in bacteria , the bacteria have started reading this genetic code and produring the viral particles .
The viral particles have then been released by the cells , they 're back and they 've been reported .
I talked about recent members of the oil industry in oil industry , and they have certainly understood this model .
They have recently .
We believe that this is a situation where the software can really build its own hardware in a biologist system .
But we wanted to do things that in great .
We wanted to build the entire chromosoma .
They 're more than 580 mile of genetic code .
So we thought we built it in cassettes of the virus , so we can change the cassets to understand what the components of a living cells .
The design is crucial , and if we start with digital information in a computer , these have to be very accurate .
When we sequenced this genome for the first time in 1995 to accurate standard was a mistaining for every 10 mile .
We found , we 've discovered , 30 errors . If we had that original sequence , we would never be able to do it work .
One part of the process is designing 50 lecking long time to make a long time to be a 50 leckly to make subunits that they 're working together .
We try to get the unique element here .
You probably have read that we 're going to read that we 're in the side of the magic .
So , think , we think , we have a genetic code on four letters : A , C , Gs and T.
Three of those letters together with them with about 20 minoacids , and there 's a specific order to be a specific order to be a leck for every friend .
So we can use the genetic code to write words , frases , thoughts .
What we 've done in the beginning was autograpraphed .
Some have been deluses that was not poetry .
We 've been designed these segments to just just just just get them up with the enzymes .
There are some of them are reflights and put them .
And we started assemble of parts , starting with segment , and we started with segment segment , unending segments of 24 mile letters in a time to 72 mile .
And we 've made these segments in abundance so that we 're trying to reach them that we 're trying to create an extremely robustoking -- as you see in a minute .
We 're trying to automatize the process .
So , this looks like the tabellon of a basket .
When we get to these very long segment , more than 100 mile , they don 't grow much more than the E.
It comes to the modern instruments of the molecular tools .
So we 've been looking at other mechanisms .
We knew about another mechanism called recombination omologa , which we knew about biology to repair the DNA to repair the DNA to be able to be segments .
Here 's an example .
This organism , called Deinococcus radioococcus , can absorb three million radiation .
You can see in the superior as his chromosophister , as it 's destroyed .
In 12 -- 24 hours , it 's been reassembled exactly as it was before .
They 're able to do it .
These organisms can be completely sitting .
They can live under empty .
They 're absolutely sure that life existing in space , and you know , and you know , and they 're song to find new riches of water .
And the real , NASA showed that this is .
This is a picture of the molecule that we 've built out of the system , just using the lights to do with the segment design of the segment .
The lights assemble them .
This image was not taken with a microscope electronic microscope , but with a microscope .
It 's a molecule that we can see the way with a microscope .
These are photos that are at a period of six seconds .
This is the advertising that we 've done a little time ago .
They 're over 580,000 letters of genetic code .
It 's the largest molecule of a defined structure ever created by man .
It has a superior or in a weight to 300 million .
If you stamp it with a caratter 10 and they would have to do 142 pages , you would just take 142 pages only to transfer this code .
Now , how do we work ? How do we do it ?
Obviously , you 're tramed a virus is a game .
It 's a little bit more complicated when you use bacteria .
It 's simpler , even when it 's it 's eucariote like our , you can just be able to be a nucleo and put up and put another , which is basically the process of clonation .
In the bacteria , the bacteria is instead of integrated in the cells , but we recently demonstrated that we are able to do a complete trapieces of a cell . And then we recently demonstrated that .
We clear a chromosoma starting from a microbial species .
The two are different as men from the topes .
We 've added some gene more in a way that we can decide what to do to do this chromosoma .
And then , he flew with the enables to kill all the protein .
And when we put it in the cells is been stupendomly -- and you 'll prezzle our own sophisticatooma -- the new new new crumosophisticatoma is gone inside the cells .
And we started thinking that we couldn 't go beyond , but we tried to get more on the way .
This is one of the major mechanisms .
We found that a lot of species have added in a second or a third chromosoma from some , add in a second , add in a second thousand new tracts to that species .
So who think about evolution as a only gene at the time that has not understood a lot of of the biology .
They 're called restriction , they call restrong restriction that they 're going to be digit .
The chromosome that was in the cells that didn 't have one .
The cell phone , the chromosome that we have inserit---shaped .
It 's expressed , and he recognized the other as exraneer , and it 's been recognized , and we 've been reached with only the cells and the new cell .
It 's become blue because of the genes we 've put in .
And in a short leaving time , all the characteristics of a species are gone . And it turned out to a new new new species , based on the new software that we have insert in the cells that we have insert in the cells .
And all the proteins have changed , the members have changed , and when we read the genetic code is exactly to what we have tranferred .
Now , this could look at genetic , but altering the software , we can change the DNA software , we can change things in a substantial way .
Now , I 've already explained that that we don 't talk about genesesis -- but to progress from three million years and a half million evolution , and I said that maybe we 're going to create a new version of Cambrian explosion of Cambrian explosion of the Cambrian .
Why do that ?
I think it 's pretty obvious when we think about our necessity .
We 're going to go to six billion and a half billion people in the next 40 years .
Right for an example : I 'm born in 1946 .
Now there are three people on the planet for each existing in 1946 .
We 're having problems now to find food , fresh water and clean , medical water and weline for six billion and a half billion people .
It will be more than that we do it for nine billion .
We use more than five billion of carbon , more than 30 billion baries .
That means a hundred million baries a day .
When we try to find biologists , or any kind of process to replace them , it will be a huge challenge .
We have to keep the whole of CO2 emission of these materials that 's going to be in the atmosphere .
At the day , because of the scientific discoveries in the world , we have a database with about 20 million genes , and I like to think that are the design components for the future .
The electronics industry is only a dozen of components , and think about how many different things are coming out .
Our limititites here are principles of the biology and our imagination .
Now we have a techniques , because of these quick methods , we can create what we call genomics .
We can build a big robot that can produce a million chromosomes per day .
So , think about the processing 20 million genes or to get to get to get to produce either or drugs , new vaccines , and we can change , we can change , we can change , we , we can change , and we create more biology now that in the last 20 years .
And it 's just a standard selection .
We can choose for survival , chemical production or carburant , production of vaccines .
This is a instantanea of some software programmed software that we 're working to be able to seat-up and designing species to computers .
Well , we don 't necessarily know how they 're going to be .
We know exactly how it is their genetic code .
Now we 're focusing on the quarter generation of the generation .
You also see you that you can extract ethanol was a bad experiment .
We have a second and third generation generation that are going to be used to be sugar to the sugar or different kinds of value as the either or different kinds of butanol .
But the only way the only way the biology can have a great impact without increasing the cost of food and limitaren the cost of food and limitaren the cost of food and limitary display the cost of the cells that we can reach this , and we think we have the first carbons of quarter in about 18 months .
The solar light solar light with CO2 is a metodo-- but in our discovered , we found different methods .
This is a organism that we 've described in 1996 .
It 's in the ocean , about 2,000 feet of the deep , about 2,000 feet of the water .
They create metane from CO2 , using hydrogen molecular as a source of energy .
We 're trying to understand if we can incanalar CO2 , which can easily be transported tramitable to , convert that CO2 in the CO2 in the carburant , to drive this process .
So , we think that we could be able to be able to increase what 's the basic question , " which is " Nooks " is " we , " greatest -- we have the goal to replace the whole oil industry .
Exactly . If you don 't do that from TED , where do you ?
It would become a main of energy .
And we 're working to use the same metods to to create vaccine .
You 've seen this year with influence , we 're always going back to the flu and a dollar in less when it comes to find the right vaccine .
I think that what you can change by building vaccines in the tinable vaccines .
So , this is how the future could start looking like , now , the tree of evolution , accelerating evolution with bacteria , and finally cell evolution , and finally initially cells .
We 're so much from the improving people .
Our purpose is to do that , we 're going to live enough to try to make it . Thank you very much . Thank you very much .
First of all of you , the fastest possible , some fundamental work , the new technology that we 've brought to a buy work . This is a year ago . This is Seadragon .
It 's a environment where you can interact is in the local level that is in the local level of visual data .
Here we 're seeing a lot of gigabyte digital photos with a kind of supply and continuous , for a fast spreadoramic , and we have the images as we want .
And it doesn 't matter how much it 's the amount of information that we see , how big these things are great of data or images .
Most of them are common digital photographs , but this for example , is a scanning scanning from the Library of Congress , and reenter in the gamel of 300 megathering .
It doesn 't make a difference because the only thing that you have the only thing that you have the prestacking the prestations of a system of a stand on your screen in any time . It 's also a very flexible architecture .
This is a book , for example , of data not images .
This is the Casa desolen of Dickens . Every colonna represents a capital .
So , to show you that it 's just a text and not images , we can do something like that , to actually see that it 's a real representation of the text , not a picture .
It could be a little bit artificial to read a electronic book .
Don 't you add it .
This is a major example . It 's a number of the Guardian .
Every picture is the beginning of a sea .
And it really gives you really really like to you and the bel experience to read the version of a magazine or a quotidian , which is for nature molteplant , which is for nature molteplant .
We also did something with the angle of this particular particular , of the Lardian .
We 've created a high higher solution-solution-solutions -- much more than what you use is used in a normal advertising .
If you want to see the characteristics of this automobile , you can see here .
Or other models , or even the specific techniques .
And this really shows some of these ideas to eliminating the limits of space on the screen .
We hope that this means to put in a little bit of a pop-up and other porcheries , you don 't have to be necessary .
Of course , the map is one of the most obvious of the most obvious of the most obvious of the technology .
And on this is not going to lose time , if we don 't say that we have contribute to this field .
These are all the streets in the U.S. underlying on a NASA geospatial picture .
So now we 're going to go to something else .
This is actually actually a vial on the web ; you can go to see it .
It 's a project called Photosynthrown , which combine two different technologies .
One is Seadragon and the other is a visual research at the very interesting computer , made by Noah Snavely , a student of University of Washington , with the help of Steve Seitz Seitz Seitz Rick Szeliski . An n collaboration .
And it 's from the web , managon by Seadragon .
You can see it when we do this kind of screaming , where we can go from a image to the other and have this kind of experience , and we have this kind of experience to solution .
But the location of the space-images here has actually a meaning .
The algorithms of the computer , they recorded these images , so that they 're all released these pictures , so that they 're stacked up to the Blagons , and they 're on the Montagne Roccious doadesious , and these things are all of a destinable or show , and these things are all of a destink or show , and these things have all been all of the spaced .
I don 't know if I have time to show you some other environment .
There are some more space .
I want to go directly to one of the original data of Noah-- and this comes from a previous prototype of Photosynthesus that we 've done for the first time , to show you what I think is really the early chad . And it 's not necessarily about the environments that we have a very clear . And it 's not necessarily obvious to look at the environments that we put in the website .
We had to worry about legal aspects and so on .
This is a re-building re-building of Notre Dame images and Flickr . Basta digites . Basta digites . And you get images of types in magic and you get images of types and by saying . Egns a picture that is discovered to this model .
So they 're all images from Flickr and they have all been related to the space in this way .
And it 's possible to be able to navigate this very simple way .
You know , I would never think of it 's going to work for Microsoft .
It 's very gratifying to get this kind of acking here .
I think you can see that it 's a lot of different types of photos , and the cell phones to the professional SLR , a meaning , and they put together in this environment .
And if I can , I try to look at those strange .
Many of them are stuck , etc .
Some part here is a series of photographs -- it 's a series of photographs -- it .
This is a Notre poster from Notre Dame registers .
We can go from the poster to the physics of this environment .
The essential point is that we can do things with the social environment . This is now taking data from a whole memory of how it looks like the Earth , from the hand-a-sign , from the visual point of view -- and we all of that data .
All of those pictures become connected , more , the major of the parts .
You have a model of the earth that is emerge .
So , think about this as a prolungation of Stephen Lawler on Earth 's virtual Earth .
It 's something that grows in complexity , as people use it , and the advantage to who use it .
Their pictures are husbed with a meat .
If you get somebody comes the idea of these sunning all of these sorts of saying the name , my shot of cattedral of all of those data , and I can use of all of those data , and I can use as a point of a re-to-throw , using the photo-th-throws of the one , and have a whole experience of cross-moby the way , and to have a red red , and the red red .
Of course , a consequence of all of this are virtual models of every interesting part of the Earth , collected , it doesn 't just tell you you would have an airplane and similar images and similar images and similar images , but by the collective memory .
Mille .
CA : I realized ? What 's good ? What your software is that your software is that you 're going to be able to do is that , in the next few years , all of the photographs are going to be practically related to ?
BAA : Yeah . What 's doing is doing is doing ,
It 's creating perlink , if you want , you 're in images .
And it 's doing it in the bottom of the images .
The thing is that it becomes very interesting if you think about wealth of semantional information that many of these images are going to be .
As when you do a research on the web , you 're digit on the web , you 're digits to the web page has a lot of information about the images .
Now , what happens if that picture is you all of your photo all of your photos ?
So the amount of semantics and the amount of richness that is really really enormous . It 's a classic effect of the network . It 's a classic effect of the net .
CA : Blaise , it 's really incredible . Compliments .
BAA : Thank you very much .
One of the main pleasure , when you travel and one of the ethnographics of the ethnographics is the way to live in the wind , you have no anti-tradions , between who has been the past , you touch it into the wind , it 's touch in the wind , he 's levert-plant .
Bastes think that the sciamani Jaguar vision , or that the monites are still in the Mitites . Inuit are still collished , or that in Himalaya , or that in Himalaya , or that in Himalaya , but to remind the central importance of the anthropology , and that the idea that the central importance of the anthropology , and that the idea that we live in the world 's not existant , but it 's just a really ,
the consequence of a particular adaptative set of adaptative choices that our estrace has done , well , many generations .
And , of course , we all share of the tracts .
All right we all try . We all do .
We 're subjects to start .
We have to death the inexorability of the death , so we don 't surprise if we 're in and we 're going to --
We all have a art .
What it does the rhythm of the song , the rhythm of the dance of every culture .
It doesn 't matter that it 's the Penan forests of the Borneo , or the following Vodoo 's lead , or the desert Kenya settentrional Kenya , or the Curander of Ande , or a cammelt in the Sahara .
He was my journey company in the desert a month ago , or a yak of yak in the lifestablic .
All of these populations teaches us that are teaching us that there are other ways of thinking , other ways of moving in the world .
And , if you think , you think , it 's a concept that it can give you hope .
To together , and together , myries of the world create a spiritual of the world , they create a cultural , which is important to well-being of the planet and it 's important to the well-being of the planet as a biosphere .
And you can think about this cultural ragnonosphere and you can call the etnosphere and you can call the etnosphere , all the concepts , dreams , and ideas , intuitions , intuitions , intuitions , intuitions , intuitions , intuitions ,
The thnosphere is the fantastic patrimonium of humanity .
It 's the symbbol of what we are and what we can be in how inquisitive species .
And because the biosphere was gravously a lot of the bescapable to ethnosphere and unfortune .
Nobody biologist , for example , it would say that 50 percent of all species is on the orders of the extinction , just because it 's fake , or -- in the earth of the world 's biologist -- and it 's not even close to the most optimistic . The one is the most optional diversity .
And the index of that is , of course , the language .
When you were born in there were 6,000 languages on this planet .
One language is not just a vocabolary , or by a series of grammatic rules .
One language is the sprayed to is the human spirit .
It 's the middle of which the animal of every culture comes in the material world .
Each language is a forest , a strong , a backin , a thought , a spiritual ecosystem .
And of those 6,000 languages , while we are here in Monterey , at least the half the way it 's not more suit .
They 're not teaching kids , the children , which means , unless that we shouldn 't shad something , which are already death .
What is more sad than being aved by the silence , of being the last to talk about a language , of being the last talk , of you don 't have a way to get the wisdom of the wisdom of the promise ?
This is a faced of someone in the world in some of the world every two weeks , every two weeks a year and it 's going to be in the tomble and the tomble .
And I know somebody who will say , " is it 's not better .
The world would not be a better place if we all talk ? " Benissim , then we all talk about yoruba . Let 's talk about dotonese .
Let 's talk about kogi .
You will be a sudden , what it means that we can 't talk about your language .
I would like to do a journey through the thnosphere .
a small journey in the etnosphere to give you a bunch of what we are losing .
Many of us are deal that when I say , " different ways to existing , " I mean , " I mean , " I mean , " " It 's really different ways of existing .
So let 's take for example , Barasana Barasana , and the settentrional snap , which crede the anaathe-, crede the sand-s-west snap in the west snakes .
It 's a popular popular that it 's not able to distinguess the blue blue blue , because the time you were identified in the forest , which depends on the forest , which depends on .
They have a strange language and a major , we called " exogamia language , " examist , " You have to married a person who talks about a different language .
And that 's all the roots in the past mitologist , but the particularity is that in these exese families where they 're talking about six or seven language , and they have meless marriage .
They 're going to be listen to and then start talking .
We take one of the most interesting tribes that I lived , the Waorani Ecuador , the Waorani Ecuador , an incredible popular popular , which has had the first contacts in 1958 .
In 1957 , they 've been trying to do a deal construct a factor .
They did from the high photographs that they reraw them in a lot of reflied , and forest that this popular of pluvial forest .
They collected the photoes , they turn them to the research , and they 're going to be a fire and , not finding anything , they were going to be on the hell , and they killed the five missionaries with the lance .
But Waorans don 't kill only to the strange .
They were killing in their own .
54 percent of the mortality was caused by their own .
We are going to eight generations and we found two different death of natural morath and when we 've been reached to know , they had a lot of them was invectured , and then they killed him him him him . And then they killed him him him .
The hunters were able to recognize the animal urine from 40 steps and recognize the species .
In the first ' 80s , I was assigned a really interesting task when my professor of Harvard , and he asked me if I wanted to go to Haiti to to the bottom of the secret of the power of Duvalier and Tonton Macoutes and Tonton Macoutes and waste Macoutes and waste .
So , to give a sense of a miraccolost , I should understand the Vodoo culture is not magic .
It 's pretty much about a complex metapphysics of the world .
Very interesting .
If I ask you to tell me the great religions of the world , what do you say ?
Cristianism , Islam , Buddism , Ebraism , etc .
A continent is always left out , thinking that sub-Saharan Africa has no religious feeds . And they and the Vodoo , and the Vodoo is not the other than the distilside of these religious concepts in the tragic tragic thinking about the schiavism .
What makes the interesting voodoo is the intend is the intend of life and death .
So , you know , they 're going to be becoming to the spirits .
The spirites can be invoced by the Great Acqua , they response to the rhythm of the dance and replace you to the rhypertively the way that for a short moment , and they get the god .
So , the voodooists love to say , " You white , you go to church to talk about God .
We give them in the time and we 're going to say God . "
And the moment you 're married , is the spirit that you drive you , how bad you 're going to be ?
So you 're at these incredible events : follow voodoo in state of trance , and you 're impuntizing , and they 're impuntizing a rather strong demonstration of the power when it 's catalyzed in a state of extreme .
And all the people who have lived the most extraordinary of the Santa Marta , in Santa Marta , in Colombia , in the Santa Marta , Colombia .
They were deeping of the ancient civilization that once once they were living on the caraibia in the Colombia in conquatic plants , the people would retreat the vulchanical massive , which is the people were in the caraibical plants .
In a continent macked continent , this popular is never conquisted by the Spanish .
But they are now now governmented by a clero , but their formation is so extraordinary .
The young people follows are cared away from the families to three or four years , and they live sat a world that 's made of buy and shaped in the bottom of the ice for 18 years .
Two periods of nine years of proposition to reproduce the nine months of management that transformed in the ushing of the mother , they are metaphor .
And that time , they 're acculturate to the values of their society , values that predict that their pyyes and only their prayers are the construction of the conduction that they 're going to say the ecological balance .
At the term of this incredible began , they 're improvised out and for the first time in their life , at the age of 18 years , they see a dawn . And that 's the consciousness of the first cut , when the sun is value of beautiful , everything that they 've learned in theory , everything that they 've learned in theory . The prey a step back and say , and it 's going back and he says , and it 's going to be a passionate , and it 's going to be in the theast .
" Have ? Right ? I said ,
It 's amazing . Now it 's about you protect it . "
They call them greater brothers and they say that we , brothers , and they say that we , brothers , we are the destruction of the world .
This level of intuition is extremely important .
When we think about the Ingene populations and the environment of the Rousseau and the old story of self-noble , which is a razy concept in its simplicity or maybe we call Thoreau and we say these people are closest to the Earth .
The Ingenes are not not feeling .
There 's no space for these things in the malarithal palum , or the winds of the Tibet , but thank you and the rings , they created a mystics of the Earth 's neighborhood , and they created a mystics of the Earth can only live in the windent . The concept that the Earth can live only because it 's infused by the human consciousness .
What does that mean ?
It means that a boy of Ande who is growing up in the mountain , it 's a spirit .
That 's the dimora of a spirit or a mineral cuting is irrelevant .
What 's interesting is the metaphor that debes the report between the individual and the natural world .
I grew up in the forests of Columbia credly credating that the forests to be cut .
And that made me a human being different from my friends Kwautl that believe that the forests are the Hukuk and the bhere of the paradise and the bis the historite of the paradise and the cannibal areas that are in the initiation Hatsa .
If you start to look that these cultures can create reality , you can start to understand some of their feelings . We do this plants .
I 've been taken this picture to open up in the nordoctor Amazon Amazon .
Mayahuasks , you may have heard about the ayahuasks , the most powerful substance of the chiamanic repertoire .
What makes it fascinating the ayahuasks is not the major potential of the substance , but its election . It 's composed to two elements .
On one side , this lian lian lian lian beta-carboline , harthm and harmolines , harmolines , hard-hallucinogene .
Taking the only plants , it has a blum that altera little bit that it 's a little bit of consciousness , but it 's measured with the leaves of a coffee family 's family , Psychotria live live live live in .
This plant is a plant plant , very similar to the serotonin , dimethox-blind , methoxydi-blind .
If you ever ever see Yanomami , you 'll get Yanomami , you know , you 're going to see the Yanoms that they do with a different methoxydic .
Tiring that poor is a little bit like to be disappeared by a card .
I was often with my professor , Richard Evan Shultes , the man who has been sweet , and he 's been schedelical , with his discovery of the fungi of the hallucinogenic fungi in the ' 30s .
I think my round , you can 't actually classify these triptamine as you can 't tell no one of being hallucinated .
It 's possible to be able to be horally only if you 're assumption with other chemicals that denian AOOOOOO .
Now it comes to the beautiful : Is that bel cool is in this liana are injititors of MAO , the same type of initial , the type of slamine . The question is a flour . The question is , in a flour popular , how these people have to find out of two demands , how do they create a biochemical version that is sound that 's sound that 's sound is sudden ?
We use the great eupherd of the proof of the proof and the error , which can reveal infruit .
But if you ask the Indians , they 'll tell us , " The plants are talking to us . "
What does that mean ?
This tribes , the Cofan , has 17 varieties of ayahuasks , which are nely in the forest , and that our eyes would be in the forest .
If you ask them how they get their tassonomonomed , they 'll tell us , " I thought I thought I thought I was there , you don 't know everything ? " I said , " No . "
The solution is : they take the 17 varieties in a full of a full of the ground and each one will cannot .
With this is not in Harvard , but it 's much more interesting to contend the stones .
Now , [ applaushes the problem is that even the problem of us that have to heart popular the Ingenes , they find paintorescles , but somehow reducts in the world , and pass .
In fact , the X-century , in fact , it will not be remembered for his guerors or innovations , but rather as the thing that we were stopped and we used active actively or accepted by the world of biology and cultural mass of the world of biology and cultural mass of biology and cultural mass of cultural diversity of the planet . Now the problem is not the change .
All cultures through the centuries have been involved in a dance for new life .
And the problem is not the technology .
The Indians Indians have no stopped to be Sioux when they put in the arc and they have no American stopped in the horse and heat .
It 's not the change or the technology that they 're threatening the integrity of the thnosphere . It 's the power .
The flight flight .
And if you give a look at the world , you 'll find that these are not destinated cultures .
They 're living creatures and spint of the hyperperperforces that go beyond their ability to adaptation .
I know that it 's a disboscation in the pair of the Penan --
a popular nobble , in Sarawak , in the south-est . And a popular popular , and now reduced to the forest to a generation . And now , now you can see the prostitution on the recentume , where you can see the river in the river , where the river is that it looks like to the middle of the Meridional Meridional Meridional Cinese , where the Japanese Meridional Meridional Meridional Meridian , where the Japeeewish sought , where the Japhoritheteteteteteth is illustration will illustration , where , where the SSSart-Canese Mol
Wote to fall on the forest .
Or , in the case of Yanomami , are the disease that are coming with the discovery of the gold .
If we move on on the mountains of Tibet , where I 'm doing a lot of research , you see the last flight flight .
As you know , the genocide , the physics of a popular popular , is convicted to a universal level , but the width , the destruction of life of a popular popular , not just an announced , but addicted to celebrate certain environments , because it 's part of the development .
And you can 't understand the suffering of Tibet until it 's part .
I 've been there in the 6,000 miles from Chengdu in Chengdu . Tibet sudoriental , coming in Lhasa with a young connection , but only come to Lhasa , but only come to Lhasa . I realized what 's behind is behind the statistics we hear .
6,000 monuments in poor and cenry .
1.2 million people killed by military in the Cultural Rivolution .
The father of this guy was ascriticized at Panchen Lama .
That means that it was killed in the time of the Chinese invasion .
Humo uncle , it 's fairly with Sua durity in the diaspora that 's been given in Nepal .
His mother was imprigioned and his colth was recial .
It was brought to career to the age of two years to be hidden under his wna because it couldn 't have a living without him .
The sister , which has done the same , was put in referred .
A day he was in a day , he was a fascipested by Mao and , for this transgression , was mit to the jobs , it was mitted to the several years .
The Tibet is to be insured , but the recently spirit , but the spirit of the people 's tener .
And then , it 's reduces a choice .
Do we want to live in the world world world of the monothic or want to account the policy or want to account the world of the policy ?
The great anthropologiet Mead , before he died that he said his greatest fear was that , in our way to this frighghtening vision of the world , not just see the entire range of human imagination reduced to a construct of thinking , but a day we 'll take on a sluem from a sleep , and we 're going to get out of the other than the other than the other than the other than the other people .
And it 's umillion to remember that our species is existed for 60,000 years .
The Neolitics Rivolution , who has given us the agriculture , which has done us subject to the seed of the seed sads , and it 's a little bit of the smoke , creating the gerarchia of specialization , and we talk about 10,000 years ago .
The modern world industry has been 300 years .
That 's a story of the story , I 'm not suggesting that we have the answers to all the challenges that we have to deal in the millennia to come .
When to these myries of cultures of the world is asked what it means to be humans , they respond with 10,000 different voices .
And it 's in these answers that we all all the answers to be what we are : a kind of a conscious kind , which has to make all the people and all the gardens can fighting . And there are great moments of optimism .
I 've been taken this picture on the northerthertherther-alone of Baffin the island of Inuit , and this man , Oaya , and this man , Oaya , Oaya , and this man , Oaya , and he told me a wonderful story of his grandfather .
The downnail government was not always gentle with the Inuit 's the ' 50s to stbilish our supremized , we have to give them in colonies .
The grandfather of this man refuted to go .
The family , I teming her life , and all of the boundaries , and all his areas .
You have to know that Inuit don 't have the cold , they do it .
The pacins of sleep in the skin were made of pain .
The grandfather of this man didn 't do intimight or by the libraric or from the libraries that was suffering .
It 's sleep , you 've been cut , you 've been hot the pantalone in the skin and defecated in your hand . When I did it , you 've been doing it .
It 's springed on the points of this hone-pointed hone-sunk .
It 's been empty to the dog and created a brighter , and he made a sleep , and he 's disappeared another dog and it 's disappeared on the bones , and it 's disappeared on the bunch , and it 's gone on the bunch , and he 's gone on .
Do we want to be able to cavarself-. And this , in different ways , [ Applausi . ] And this , in different ways , [ Applausi . ] And all the popular popular people in the world .
In the april of 1999 , the canadese government has reached the total control of an area of the larger territory of California and Texas monitors and Texas monkey .
It 's the new patria . It 's called Nunut .
It 's a independent territory . They all the resources .
One of the splendid of a natione-state can recognize with his popular .
And , to finish , I think it 's pretty obvious at least at least in the remote song of the planet , realized that they 're not remote .
For someone is home .
They represent seitions of human imagination that are going to be at the boundaries . And for all of these children , as the dreams of these children , they become part of our children , become part of the hope .
So , in the end , we have Geographic , we convince that politicians will never come to nothing .
We believe that the polemies --
[ Applausi ] are not persuasive , but we believe that stories can change the world , and maybe we are the best institution to tell the stories of the world . EEEvery month , our website has to be 35 million visit visit .
156 countries have spend our television channel .
Our rists are thritings are thritings .
Our work is to travel in the ethnosphere to bring our audience in the mart places that are going to be able to be able to have seen and , and , you will be hopefully , they will habrow for the central reveal . And we have to find a style in the diversity , and we have to find a life in a pluralist world of pluralist and multicultural world , and we have to find a life in a plural world in a pluralist and the world
where the wisdom of all the population can contributing to our well-being collective well-being collective .
Thank you .
I 'm going to talk about some things that I wrote in this book that I hope you 've already heard and I 'm going to try to get some of the connections , in case you don 't notice .
I want to start with what I call the " official dogma official dogma .
The official dogma official dogen ?
The official dogma official dogma , the official dogma official dogma : " If we want to massimilar well-being of our citizens . "
The reason is , from one side , in fact that liberty is in itself a value , is pretious , is useful , essentially , for human beings .
The other is that if we are free , and we can do it for all of us can act for the deal with all of what massixes our well-being , without no one that we decide in the name of our name .
The way to massimilar liberty is massive to be massimilar .
More choices people have , more are free , and the more is their freedom , the more , is their well-being .
This , I think , is so deeply daily doubt in the society that nobody would be able to put it in doubt .
And it 's also dancly double in our lives .
I 'm going to show you some examples of what progress has made possible .
This is my supermarket . It 's not particularly big .
I lose a simple note on the conditions for the winter .
In my supermarket , there are 175 conditions , and not content the 10 varieties of the olive of the olive , and 12 aceters that you can buy for a huge number of conditions in the increscement of the constance of the constance of the constance of the constance of the wildness of the wildness of the wildness of the wildness of the wildness .
Here 's what the super-market .
Then you go to the store of electronics to buy a stereo : CD lector , radio , piahand , lefer , blood , the lefer .
And in this single store of electronic , there 's a great number of components .
We can do six million and a half million different combinations of the components that there are in one store .
You have to admit that there is a lot of choice .
Other fields : the world of communications .
Once , when I was a child , you could get all the telephone services , and they were fornitable to the path that they were fornites .
It was going to get the phone , you didn 't buy it .
One of the consequence of that , the next was that the telephone never breed .
These days are gone .
We have now a lot of the telephones , especially between the cellphone .
Here 's the cell phone .
My favorite is that in the middle , MP3 , cut out of the nose , and foreign for the brulele .
If you don 't have seen it in the store under home , you 're not seen it .
And what happens is that they 're going to happen to the stops and it does this question . And you know what the answer is , " No . "
It 's not possible to buy a mobile phone that doesn 't do too many things .
So , in other aspects of life that are much more importantly than the acquiists , you know , the same sounds of choice .
Axtioning : Does , not going on the United States that you go from the doctor and the doctor you have to do .
Instead , you go to the doctor , and the doctor says , " OK , we could do A , or B , " A , " A has these benefits and these answers . What do you want to do ? "
You say , " Dotore , what should I do ? "
And the doctor says , " A has these well-to-lawers and B has these benefits and these hand-up . "
" What do you want to do ? "
And you rebits , " Dotore if you were me , what would you do ? "
And the doctor , " But I 'm not . "
The result of the call we " autonomous " , " expression that makes it look like a beautiful thing .
But it 's actually not that one move the weight and responsibility to make decisions from someone who knows something , which is the doctor , and then it 's a daily , and so almost certainly it 's maled -- and so not in the ideal condition to make decisions that the patient decisions .
There 's a huge marketing of products , and you know , and you know , that if you think you think it 's not a sense , because you think you can 't buy them .
But if we can 't buy them , why are they public ?
The answer is that they want to domesting that we call the doctor to ask them to requcies .
So , what 's like our identity is our horrise is that we 've ever ever ever seen this dream . " We don 't want to force the children . They 're going to be able to provide .
And we can reinvented how many times us do it .
That means that every morning , at the answering , you have to decide that kind of person want to be .
I 'm going to get family and marriage , a time perspective , and it was that it was that there was a deal , and it was that it was that you were married to the most soon as possible .
The only real choice was with who , not when , and even when , and it 's not what to do after .
Over the day , it 's really to play .
I teach students very smart , and I do their 20 percent of work than a time .
And it 's not because they are not just just as much less diligent .
but why are they impensieres , I mean , " Do I should be married or not ? I have to do it right now ? "
" Do I have to marry me later ? "
They 're interrogatives .
And they try to answer these questions , even though this impracy is not going to be able to get the tone and I don 't get a beautiful vote to my examamamage .
And they have to really do it . They 're important questions .
Now , the work : we are fortunate , as Carl underneath , because the technology allows us to work every minute , every day , every day , every day , on the corner of the planet , transcent , and from the Hotel Randolph .
And in parenty-up , there 's a angle , and I don 't tell anyone , where the WiFi works .
I don 't tell you , because I want to use it .
What does that mean , this amazing freedom of choice that we have to work ? It 's that we have to continue , and we have to work or not .
We can go to see our son , playing hot , with the mobile phone in a pocket , Blackberry in the other , and the tears , and the tears , and the tears .
And even though they 're all spent , every minute that we see our son , you 're also asking the party , we 're also asking , " Do you respond to this call ? "
" Do I have to answer this email ? I have to get this letter ? "
And even when the answer is " no , " , " all this makes the experience of your son 's party , very different than what would be in other conditions .
So , from any of the little and the small stuff and big , and big stuff , life , life is a question of choice .
Once the world was this : Ovreal , there was some possibility , but it was not a question of choice .
The world of today is a mile . The dilemma is , " That 's a positive thing , or negative ? "
The answer is Surprize .
The positive latory of positive them , so I 'm going to talk about the negative .
And this is a very optional choice , two effect on people .
The first , paradoxally , is that it produced a paralysis that it 's going to be liberation .
With a lot of options between which to choose , it becomes very difficult to do it .
I give you a meaning example : a study conduct for volunteer .
And a connection of my colleagues had access to the Sundancing society , in a million pension of a million clients in 2,000 different companies .
What she discovered is that for every 10 solutions that are offered in more , the percentage of adesion , the percentage of adesion .
With 50 four-offers , there 's 10 percent in less than adhhold , at least than adesions . Why ?
Because with 50 fourds between which to choose , is maledtely difficult to decide , and choice is remained to the intomormorrow .
And I ask tomorrow , and I ask tomorrow , and of course , tomorrow , and of course , and of course , and of course , tomorrow , and of course , tomorrow , and tomorrow , and of course , tomorrow , and tomorrow , and asked the tomorrow , and tomorrow , and of course , tomorrow , and tomor
You know , it doesn 't mean that that these work from old old work for dogs because they don 't have enough money , they also want to say that the decision is so so obstical that allose is so that they lose the fundamental fundamental fundamental fundamental fundamental .
They 're not talking about , they 're losing until five thousand dollars for year in the work , which would be well disposed to be .
So , the paralysis is a consequence of having too many choices .
And I think it makes the world that .
" And to finish , " And to finish , ketchup , or maion , or maion ? "
You would take the right decision , if it 's for ethernity , is it ?
You don 't want to choose the wrong wrong , and you 're neither the wrong condition .
So this is the first effect . The second is that we also have to avoid paralysis and do a choice , we 're less to be made of the resulted as we 're going to be been with less options .
And this for different reasons .
One of these is that with a lot of conditions in which you choose , and you buy one and it 's not perfect , it 's easy to imagine that you could have been better . And what happens is that 's going on be better . And what happens is that 's going on on the choice , and the rediministring the soddisfer , and the redit of the choice , and the redit of the choice , and the repress the soddisfenage ,
And when it was a great decision .
More choices are , it 's easier than any detail that 's insoddisfacing that it 's unusually .
And then , there 's what economists call expensive expensive opportunity .
Dan Gilbert has closed very well stamacine as the value that we do things depends on what we confront of .
And then , when there are so many options , it 's so easy to represent the characteristics of the alternative art-weless and be less submitted .
Here 's an example . I 've been schooling with all of the ones that are not New York .
But that 's what you probably think you would be .
There 's this copy of Hamptons .
A lussized place .
It 's sweaming . Otma day . It 's all for them .
Not nothing . But what he thinks is , " Well , sick , and it 's Agoam . "
" All my neighbors in Manhattan are away . "
" I could talk about it right in front of the home . "
And it 's going to go to two weeks of the idea that it 's loss -- every day -- the chance of parking where it wants .
The constoopportunity decrease the subdisfairly for what we have , even when the choice was excellent .
And the other are the options that we have to look at , more the characteristics will be going to be reported by constant .
Here 's another example .
This is telling us a lot of things .
It 's going to live the moment , and maybe a living slowly .
But the most important thing is that you choose , you 're going to be doing the other .
The things that we don 't choose to be a lot of attractive , they can make less attractive what we do .
Third point : spiral growing of expectations .
I tried it on my skin buying a new couple of jeans .
I 'm going to be jeans .
Once the jeans were just a guy , buy them and they were buying besty , and they were discovered , just after they were cared to a life and work with a lot of times , they were going to be good .
So , I went to buy a couple of new when the old old people were gone , and I said , " I need a couple of jeans , this is my cut . "
The commit said , " Look , you want slifit , and fit ? "
Do you want to the cernier or with the bottons ? " Stonehed " or " acidasases " or " acidjudges ? "
" Looks do you ? "
" Do you want to get them or stretch ? Bla bla bla -- " Continured to elentail .
I was sbalorger , and after a little bit , and I was able to say , " I want the guy , " I want to know , " I want to be , so I had to be , so I tried to all the jeans , and then I was out of the store , I know , and I was a best .
It was the massive . With all that I had the best .
But I felt out worse .
Why ? I wrote a whole book for you .
The reason I was worse is that with all that I was with all that choice of my expectations had to be perfect .
I was expectations . I didn 't expect to me anything exceptional , when I was there was one guy , but when I live 100 different , accidents , at least a guy had to be perfect .
What I was buy , but not perfect .
After I have to do that chosen with what I was trying to do , and I was satic in front of the waitment .
The add options in life , it doesn 't do that increasing the expectations that these have respect to the etheless of the options of the same .
And this will be less satisfacing , even when the results are good .
Nobody in the world of marketing , and it realized .
Because if they knew , you would not know what I 'm talking about .
The truth looks more at the truth .
" They were better when it was worse , " The reason that was better when it was worse was worse , when it was worse was even possible to meet of surprised .
Over the world , in the world we live -- opuling , industrialized citizen , industry , the massive that we can hope is that things that we can hope is that things are the things to the alteness of expectations .
You will never have surprised because your waitment , because your waitment , my waitment , you 're ingiant .
The secret of happiness -- what you 're here -- is , " Baxy waitment " Yes , you want . "
I mean -- small , I mean , I 'm really , married and my wife is really really amazing .
I couldn 't do better , I didn 't have to do it , I didn 't have to do it .
But it 's not always a bad thing .
And finally , a consequence of buy a couple of jeans , when there 's just that jeans is that when you 're not satisfacts , and you know , " Why ? "
" Who is responsible ? " , the answer is close .
The world is responsible . What could I do you do ?
When there are hundreds of kinds of jeans , and you buy a satisfacing , and you ask who is who responsible , is the clear , it 's the clear , it 's the clear you .
You could do better .
With hundreds of varieties , there are no insuccess .
So when people take decisions , even though the result is alid , they feel like they 're satic , they 're satic , and they get the hold them .
In the last few years , the depression is explose in the world .
I think a meant factor -- not the only one , but important -- of this wave of depression is that people have deludents because the standard experiences , because the standards are too high .
And when they have to explain this situation think that the colth is they think that colth is .
So the final result is that we 're going to general , we 're going to hear worse .
Let me remember you .
This is the official dogma , what we all take for good and it 's completely fake . It 's not true .
There 's no doubt that a little bit of choice is better that I don 't have any business , but it doesn 't really really take that much more of a little bit .
There 's a critical value , magic . I don 't know what it is .
But I 'm sure that we 've been overcome by a piece of the level where choices do to improve our life .
Now , from the political point of view -- I almost finished -- from the political point of view , the noction is the following .
What it allows this choice in the industrial society is the material .
There are many places in the world , and you know , you know , where the problem is not that they have a gotten choice .
The problem is that they have too much .
So the factory that I 'm talking about is a males of modern , require , reququire society .
And what it does to do and climbing is this : Steve Levitt Levitt has talked about how expensive and discovered ways of the stundully and the pursues of money .
I mean that these choices , complicated and avoid , it 's not that they 're just inuseful .
I 'm sure . I 'm sure .
They 're going to be worse .
If a little bit of what in our society is allows so they were reversed in those where people have too much chance , it would not just be their life to improve but our own life .
This is what economists call a paretian improving .
It 's a redistribution of income back to all -- not only to poor -- because of this choice in excess that we have .
So , you can get it , " Fille , you can get all you want "
You know , people , you 're going to think , " But what does it believe that fish ? "
" It 's obvious that you can 't get nothing in a glass box . "
" A castrated , a limited vision of the world --
and I 'm going to be interpreted .
But then , think , instead , I realized that , instead , I realized that that fish the long fall .
Because the reality is that if you 're sent in frantums the bock , so that , " everything you can 't do you get freedom .
If you breaks the box in a way that all decreases you can diministrate satisfaction .
You can get the paralysis , and you reduced the well-being .
Everybody needs a sphere .
This is almost certainly too much , maybe even for the fish , and it 's just certainly for us .
But the absence of some symbolic symbolic sphere is a recipe for infeless and , for the ruin the middle .
Thank you very much .
