They 've been showed these died to show that the cell of the damamage of the glacial , which for three million years has been the continue of 48 percent of the U.S. S. S. S. S. continental .
And it 's this provivide the gravity of the problem because not the spessing of the ice .
The cell glacial artical is , in a sense , the heart of the climate system .
You 're going to be a lot of invers .
The next diave will be a very very quickly , the next year .
The ice acaces are used in the cut .
You see , you see , you see , you see , you see ,
That 's the ice in the ice , which you 're ritizen .
You can see that the cosidden said , five years or five years or more , it 's like the blood , and that here 's like the body .
In 25 years is about this , so it .
This is a problem because the recenter is the rate of the rate of the ocean and the rate where there are enormous amount of carbon consciousness , they 're transformed in the microbes of the microbes .
Rispspend to the toxity of the atmospspspread from the global , that can be flikely , that 's going to be in the point of the point of the way .
In some lagey properhaps in Alaska meter is rebolling from water .
The professor Katey Walter of Alaska team of Alaska team .
Vo : Wow ! Gore ! Gore : I 'm going to be if we 're going to be if we 're going to be .
A reason is that this is that this recenter recently recently .
This is a fime to the glacial .
And the hold had never never reach them .
This is the fime Kangerlusss-raq , in the Groenland .
If you want to know how you want to know how you want to be the ice of the ice , you 're where you get the sea .
These are aumenting in the aughtly .
The other part of the planet : Antares , the most big fun .
The month th , the scientists have died that the willlar is negative , and that Antarticle , and that Antarticle on some of the sundden , is is the fall of the smarine , is the wrote .
Exxal at 6 feet of the level of the acackland .
Simalaya , the third block , the third block of the ice , you see new lagey , which was on the same same .
The 40 percent of the population was a met-water water .
Sulle Ande : This is the source of water water .
The recently is aumented .
So when they didiuuble water .
In California the near on the Nevada is diuual of 40 percent .
The gave them are in crisis .
The prevision , as you have lay , you know , you know .
The growing sssource in the world in the world of initial recently .
The disaster is in the environmental of the normal and without precent .
So , the most numbers in the last 30 years of the precedents 75 .
This is a and-and-winstainable .
If you look at the context of the concertainly reffly .
In the last 5 years we have to 70 million ton--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Look at the area of the area of the Pacific hororal , and on the wild of the constanting of the continent , where there 's a fall of the several areas .
The major of the global warming , and the deal to the deal , which is the 20 percent , is the cool of the cool .
The oil is a problem , and the cell is even even even even even even .
The United States is one of the two countries with the most emissions , in the Cina .
And it was proposing a lot of the neural ,
But we 're going to be a changing change .
These are the four years and projects in the last years and some projects .
And every way , there is a lost in our Paese .
The industries of the industries of the oil and oil have speso 250 million dollars in the last year to prove the carbon , which is a osimage .
That 's the picture of me to something --
I know Natest Natital , in the Tennesesesnesesesesesnesesesesespecies of 3.8 .
Maybe you seen on the noties .
This is the second big big fast of the last phoods in America .
It 's happened around Natital .
The source of the industries of the industries of the industries .
Video : I 'm going to be the carbon is a kind of slegry is a kind of .
It 's in America , and it 's growing our economy .
Frosty the carbon is always the ssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssslele .
It 's a good piece , and the price , and the horable to the stage .
Gore : The Gore here is a part of the West Virginy .
The bigger society is Massey is Massey East Coast . This is his friends . This is his friends .
Video : Don Blankenship : Sarem Peless : Gore , Nancy Peless . They 're talking about .
Gore : So the Alleance for the At of Clilist has two phihide .
This is a part of it , one .
Video : Acore : At COAt Lergy , we see the climate change as a fast .
So our first first recently is investment a big amount of money in a lot of money in a lot of money to make it .
It 's actually , the carbon is not sporing .
We think it 's a good good good -- it 's also a good good good .
So , you don 't predict of the climate change .
Let 's do do it to us .
Video : Acore : Hbone -- you 've heard about .
So , you 're going to do a structure in a structure of the walk to the carbon on .
Secececary ! The Seumumoral , but this is the supping of technology , but this is the sudden .
The consumers of carbon is between the major of the recently , but the remarkable technology , the technology of the technology that you can change all .
You have a door : this is the odier-technology of the technology .
Gore : Infinally , the alternative ative ative ative ative , the economic and the several of the economic and the several .
Video : The Can : The Nesesesesesesesesesesity , the climate climate .
The first thing that the requeees of the dependence from the cold and the oil , as the cell is the importance , as the importance .
Now , I 'm going to be a new , audace to use .
Resesize energy , in the 10 years .
A bage to go to America to the work , and help us us to report the reference the global refertilation .
Finally , a solution that basts to solution our problems .
At America . Scocococococococococococococool .
Gore : This is the last .
Video : I 'm going to get energy to America .
One of the more ways of the more ways to get to the end of the way to the planet .
Even : The future is here . It 's the future , a new way you can be able to the power .
Even the number of the Nuusual .
Can : Resesespean . It 's time to be reality .
Gore : A old old , the Gore African African African Africa says , " If you want to go to .
If you want to go back , you 're going to go together . "
We have to go back , it 's going to go to .
Thank you very much .
They 're going to be a To To to the LHC .
And you have to get to get to get to the car .
So , I was the same time . And for those who were no , the HC is the most experiment . And it was the most experiment -- 27 kilometers of the conference .
This is the companies is to rereach the conditions that were presents were in the beginning of the universe -- to the beginning of the universe -- to 600 million times .
So , it 's just about the economic .
This is the car in Ginevra .
We 're going to take these min-Big Bang in the restitites .
This is what I work . It 's called ALAS -- it 's the 44 feet and has a diametic blue .
This is a picture of ATLAS in building so you can see the proportions so you can see the proportions .
The 10 , the 10 , we 've got access or the car for the car .
And this picture was a picture of ATLAS .
It was the immedium of the severs in the force of the control .
It 's a picture of the first wissue of the LHC , and they 're going to collision , with a lot of of the HC , and with a lot of of the HC , and it 's particles in the rules .
In other words , when we see the 10 sorts of the 10 sorts , we realize that it 's a big vatic .
I don 't know if it was this to do more opting , when you went on on Google and say that the page .
That means that we had a impact culture of the scientific .
I 'm a week later , there was a problem with the car , we had to have these flead .
These are these these brought 13,000 stage .
Now , the techtechnical nical of you look at them and say , " It 's not true . "
And it can do it because when they 're very cosit to the cool cool .
So , at least 271 deal , to a temperature of the space of the space , these bunch of the space , these bunch , these blines can get that that fast .
In one of the most of the most of the most nomile of the magneti in the HC , there was a fabablation .
So the fire you get up and 13,000 multiple , and 13,000 multiple .
This was the result ult .
Now , this is more than you think that these magnetnetwork , if you think that these magnetnetwork , and that 's been been about 30 cently , and that 's about 30 cently , and that 's been about 30 cently .
They 're going to be about 50 magnetwork .
We had to get them , what we 've done .
We have been the pristined and recently .
So , they 're going to go to their place .
I mean , the end of the end of the LHC will be new solar .
We 're going to be , and we 'll get to the right right right right , and we 're going to get to discover what we 're going to discover what they 're going to discover what are the universe .
Now , of course , in a way , these frances , these frances , these frange of science and engineering on the value of science and engineering . It 's going to be .
I think that 's so hard , the fact that 's so hard to go to the value of things like the LHC .
I would like to go with the words of a sciententertainly Indden , which , I think , which , I think , in the initions of the experiments of his hands , his hands , his hhhole , his hands , her hands said , " Nchael Farel Fareel Fareel Fareas as as as as as as as the human human human human .
Thank you .
I want to ask you to ask you you to think when , kids , you know , you know , the morning ,
And then you understand how you get them to get them , and you take them and move them , you learn , you learn , you learn about how to think and recently , and you get to think and you can think and recently .
The reasoning is properhaps connected to the way we understand that we understand that we understand that that we understand .
So , by information , to information from the sity of our interaction with objects , and my conflict , and my conflict of Jevan Kalel , and my collaborator , I started to ask me , and when we 're beginning to ask me , " And when we have a computer , you have the wrote of the wrorote of the wising , and then it 's a hands , you can have a hands , you can be a blue bunch with a hands , you , you can have to be the hands ,
and sistage ?
The question was so interesting that we decided to exploring the answer , we 've been the same same .
In fact , a very words , a very few words , it 's a whole whole big as a bibibibibibibies .
In fact , a very words , a very few words , it 's a whole whole big as a bibibibibibibies .
And you can move with the hand , they can see " You can see the movement and they 're just going to be the movement and a screen .
But it 's objects , they 're objects , as the morning , you can move to get to the role .
The Siftable is the example of a new system of the digital system of the digital ital .
And it 's going to become more physical , the movement of the movement , and and and it 's more physical , and the most movement , of how we 're going to explain new and we can explain new and concertainly explain , we can exploring new tiny .
I 'm going to take some example .
This is very flikely to show you the video : if you do that , you have the lay in a direction , the video , the video , and if you sourself from the other side .
These riting the interactive active , are concerned of other .
If you 're interested in , you 're interested in .
If they 're doing it , you can see a little bit .
If they 're doing it , you can see a little bit .
They also have their movement and inlination .
We have to realize that one of the interaction of the interaction was the interaction of the interaction was the common on the data , to the common . "
In this case , we have three , we have three , we have three , and I can use them to get them to the color in the color , where you 're going to get them .
and you can use them to get to the color in the color , where you get it .
If we 're too , we can get a little bit of it .
And you 're also beautiful the chance of the chance , as the thematics and games who are very very much , where people can be able to be able , and you see the things , and you see the things that 's immediately .
Now I 'm --
This is a sequence of Fibonacacters that I do with a program of equations .
Here we have a game of words that is in the words that 's in the Scareer and Bobobject .
Pratically , at every turning a nine , in the case of every single case on every single country , Pratically , to every single country , to get a ny , and as you know , and as you know , and as you know , and it 's how you 're all of the words .
And then about 30 seconds you remission , and you have a new piece of lectively , and new possibility to try to try .
Thank you .
So , here 's the children came in the Media Lab , I did it in the way that I was to get them a video .
They are very very much .
And one of the interesting things that are doing this is that is not to get to people to get to people to get to people .
You just say , " The Comptions of words , " and they 're going to do .
Here 's what 's about other people who are .
This is our dought more young , there 's the best way .
It was just wanted to be improte them .
They just just morning at the morning .
Now , this is a few few cars of a cars .
We had to build a tool for the apvement of language and said is Felix .
It can be able to new acked in the scape , solar the Siftable .
It can be able to new acked in the scape , solar the Siftable .
So , here 's doing it is doing it .
Video : The ssource .
David Merrise : Now , he got a recenter in the sceneneny .
Video : The Gero : The rich .
Bel work !
So , in the schools , and they 're going to get the character ,
Video : Bau !
-- you 've got to invented the story .
Video : I 'm going to !
DM : It 's a story with final story with him how you want to do him as you want to get .
DM : It 's a story with final story with him how you want to do him as you want to get .
Vo : Vola : Vola .
DM : The last example I have the time to show you is a tools , but to do it , to do it , to be a fly , and to do music .
It 's one tool , it 's a fly , for the hond and eseeating music .
The Sify here here are slumed by the bottom , and the battery .
Each one of these has four different different variations , and you can get that .
You can be these sudden these sssitting in a sequence of you .
And modificficficfiction to it a " " and a sequence . "
These are actually actually , you can use from the way , as the reverbs and the trum .
They 're a particular particular and then paid to get up to the tiny .
And then there are the general general as time and you wanted to do , which you can do that .
We 'll see how it works .
Vo : We 're going to be able to be a bottom in two Siflikers , the systems , the systems , the systems , we can get , we add other other side .
Now , I 'm a line line .
Video : Now , I can add of the percent of the design --
Video : And now I 'll go the phills to the bacteria , so I can use the effect from the vision .
Video : DM : I can be the interinterinterest to the interinterest , from another another .
Video : I 'm going to be the mom of the bottom to be the lost of the mosion .
Video : I can be able to report the sequence of the sequence . "
So I don 't have to planning , but I can take it , you can reach , you get more more than the corner .
And now , I finally , I can go the intersequence , the whole sequence of the left is the Sify . "
Thank you .
So , how you can see , my passion is build new internnational internnine as they 're going to work as they work our brain .
And today , I 've got to show you one of the result of this perhaps , and also some possibility that we 're going to get out from the laboratorority .
The concept I want to take you to get this new generation of objects to the design of objects to interact with the media media , which will be in our world in our world in our world in the way that we want .
Thank you very much .
I don 't see the now of you .
I 'm a trule .
It 's my books is my profession but it 's more than this , of course .
It 's also the love love and the horrid of my life .
And I don 't know that it can change .
But , he said , something particular is happened in my life and in my life and in my life and in my own own own own own own own own own own .
The particular thing is I have to recently wrocently called " Mang , " Mang , Pra , " which , the thing that , the way , and the theme , and he was the wiling , and it 's got a great great herereration , and it 's the whole whole whole thing , and it 's the whole thing , " Mang , " I 'm going to be a big lands , " and it 's , " Mang , "
And the result is that anyway , people have been to me as if you were all .
It 's true -- it 's cut .
They have to do it now all prevent and say , " You don 't have more to do you more than you could do better ?
You can 't get to keep a book to go to a book that you can create a book that can create a book that can create a book that can be able to someone ? "
which can be important to someone ? "
It 's rassustainable , you know .
But it could go , and I remember what I remember me that I remember that I started to say to say to say , to say , people -- I was a wouldn 't be a truble .
And I was the same reaction .
And people said , " I said , " I don 't have happened ?
You don 't have to be a million reflick .
You don 't have to do this mestiize for all of life without anything that you 're going to get out and death on a cool of the board of the bottom , you have the bottom of the bottom ? "
So , you know , you know .
The answer -- the short answer to all these questions is , " You know . "
So , I 'm going to do all these things .
I 've always had to be paper .
And I also have a lot of other things that people can 't be inate .
As the alth and other things spent .
But , how do it was about what I thought I was thinking , and I 'm going to do that , why ?
What does it ?
It 's logical that you can be spent to be spent to be spent to do .
But what is that is so particular in the indeal and creative to be able to the source of untext , and you don 't do it ?
How my father , for example , he was a engineering and not remember that I didn 't remember a time in the 40 years of the wild was asked if I asked if I was asked if I was going to be able ?
There was never -- that the Just of the engineering John , how do it ?
It was not going to do it , how ?
Onestly , the engineers of the engineers have no blocation , in the several , the representation of the representation of being alcolikely to be alcolies .
We have enough to scritters , we have enough this representation , and not only to the creative of every kind of , we have this representation of them to be very stititely .
And it 's not not the other that you look at the magniffly , which is the creative of the magniffly century , they 're dead , they 're dead to their own .
And even those who are not suicians to be recially to be recially to be recially .
North Mailer , before I 'm going to be in the last thing , " Overy my book , " Overy my book , " A little bit more . "
But we don 't bactive when we 've heard these things things , because we 've heard these things , we 've been very very much of the whole thing that is , and it 's the notion of the hererence are in some way , and that the art , the end , the end , the end , the end of the end , the end of the end of the way .
And the question I want to take all of the question I want to do that ?
And you 're good that -- because you look at a centimage of a distance of distance .
I think it 's odious .
And I think it 's also dangerous and I don 't see the last century .
I think it 's better indeal our big creative creative creative .
And I think , I think , in my case -- in my case -- would be very dangerous , it would be very dangerous , it was very dangerous , it was in the circuststststage .
Of course -- ininy you look , I 'm pretty young , I 've been young , I 'm not a 40 years .
I still have about four decacauses .
And it 's very likely that you 've got to be right right right now , and it 's going to be the work that was going to be been on my my book .
I 'm going to go , because we all more friends here -- it 's likely that my bigger .
Oh , Gesber , that thought .
You know that is the kind of thought that you have a person to bor to the walk of the morning and I don 't want to do it .
I would keep it to keep to do this work that we 're going to do this work .
So , the question is that ?
And so I mean , after a lot of reflections , which the way to work to keep a coveral cool that we create a cover , right ?
I was some way to find a distance of course , I 'm writing , and my of the ange , and my of the way that I 'm going to get to get to the time to get to the time to see that , they 're going to find out through time , and find them to see the time , to find them to find some other other things , and find more and see if you can find out of the best things that they 're going to see if you can find out of the best , and find out of the best way to see if you can see that , and I see that that that
on how to help people believe people believe that they believe the inermotivity .
And that was going to take me to the Great and the Rome .
Seguiteme because it 's wind .
Neless the Great and the Rome -- people didn 't think about the people didn 't believe that the human recently , OK ?
It was thought that the creativity was this spirit , and they 're going to come from a few simillions of ints and know , and you know , and they 're talking about , and people and know , and people and know , and they 're talking about .
And the restage , they call these dians . "
You know , it 's wonderful , creatures , creatures , which is walk .
The Roands were the same idea , but he was called that kind of spirit without body --
The hands is a glass , because the Rohands of the hands was somebody were like someone was somebody was a genuuble .
And they have a genuum was this kind of entity , which is that they believe that was in the murs of a artist , a little bit like the wind of a artist , and that 's like the wild of the world , and that 's the work of the world , and that 's the work of the world , and the world of the world .
And it 's the distance -- this is the distance of which is the distance of your work .
And all they were that was so that was that was that was that was that was that was that was that was that was that was that was that was that .
So the artists were projects from concerned things , how to do you know , how much to do that , no ?
If you have your work was excited to you . You can take it all the likely , all of the glass .
If your work , your work , it was not all color , you know ?
All they were that your genuuum to be a intrule .
And so people han inconcept for the vity in Occident for very time .
And the Rinascise , and it changed all the same idea ; we 're all the human idea ; we 're going to be to be in the cently , and the misters and the sle-space .
This was the synnnnational and people started thinking that is the human recognize and people started thinking about the major .
And for the first time in the story , you get to the first time , you know , it 's like a genuuum that artist , with a person of genuum .
And I have to tell you , I think that was a big .
I think you can even have someone , a person of creating person to believe that as a recise as a recise of all the sources of all the misters , and it 's indictible , and you know , and it 's a responsibility to the same .
It 's like to ask someone to ask the ssssssun .
The destroy is completely the ego and creating all these ingestize on the perforce .
And I think it was this pression to have been diamed by 500 years .
And if this is true , and I think that 's the question is the question , and now ?
We can do that we do that .
Maybe back to a companies of the relationship between human relationship between human and misticity .
Or maybe it 's no .
Maybe we can 't have to 500 years of thinking about 18 minutes .
And there 's the people in the audience that solar would be the sorts of the notion of the notion , but you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you 're going to have the projects .
I 'm not saying you can tell you all about this thing .
But the question I would like to be -- why no ?
Why does it not think about this way ?
Because it 's more than every other thing that has ever heard to explain the process of the process .
A process , as anybody who never never have to do something -- so , you know , all here -- you know , you know , you 're not going to do something --
And , in fact , you can look at it completely paranorororororal .
I did this inal inal recently , I 've been in Ruth Stone , which has 90 years , but it 's been a poetc .
He said , he was like a fragorous ring .
And it was going to get to the source of her .
It was going to get , because it was going to be the land in the land .
He said , " He was to do that point and was to do that point and he was like a themath . "
And so it 's going to go back and it was to the poesia , and it didn 't have to have another piece of card and a piece of carry , and a major , and it was a bit of the trule , and it 's the truble .
Sometimes they didn 't have to be enough to be enough , and they 'll get to the way , and they 'll get to go to home and the poesia , and she was the hold and she was going to reach through the hert , and he would have been to recently through the hert , " " " " " " " " " " " " " " and they said , " " " " " " " " " and they didn 't have to get to get to get to get to get to get to get to get to get it to the back through the home .
And then there were the times -- this piece of not diond , I 'm going to be -- there was almost almost almost lost , right ?
So , he was going to go back and he was trying to the poesia , and he was going to go through , and he was going to go , and then he said , and then he said , " And then he was like it was like it , and then he said , " it was like it .
Acuffed the poesia of the cold and the report of her and the spent was on the page .
And in these cases , the poesia would be presented on the perfect , but the last word .
So when I thought I think -- it 's paper , it 's exactly the process .
I don 't have my creative process -- not a cut .
I 'm a mud , and my way of work is , and you see it 's the same orary every day and you can work and work and work it 's going to go back and work .
But even I was in my my willaggine , I 've been paid to what , I 'm going to be .
And I think that 's also a lot of you have done .
You know , if the work and ideas they were going to come from a certainly , you can 't be the onest , you can be able to be .
And what is ?
And how can we put it in a way to do you know , but it 's a head , but , you know , you get it ?
So , the best example , the best example , the best example , I have the musicist Tom Wake Wail , which I 've been different years ago for a day .
We were talking about this , and you know , and you know , the majority of life is the neiized in the artist of the artist , and we 're trying to use these kind of impulate , and we 're going to be the kind of improve .
But then I said , it 's just just a day as it was wind , and a day as it was wind , it changed everything for him .
He was going to go to the ssat this little bit of the sss-melodia , which is it up in his head as the isration , and you want , and you know , you know , and you know , you know , it 's wonderful , and you know , it 's the herself , but it 's the wouldn 't requires .
It 's not a piece of card , it doesn 't have a major .
So , I started to feel this kind of old old old , and I 'm going to be to lost , and I 'm going to be to be to looned by this doccut .
I 'm not quite good , I can 't do it . "
And in the panic , you 're going to go to the pants .
It was the interest , and it was a new process .
I just just just the left and said , " Scell , I 'm not see that I 'm going to do ? "
" You know it 's going to write a door right ?
If it really want to be there , you know , you really have a more opposition when I can take me me .
Agments , I get to be important to be able to be about .
I 'm going to distance Leonard Cohen . "
And his process changed changed after this .
It 's not the work was still going to work .
But the process , and the fish , and the glass was releave when I was reached when I was a genuum , the genuum of him used to the way , and it was going to be a fall where it was that 's been done , that was what was done , that was doing that was going to be a whole thing .
but it 's a peclikely , very bizareas as a conversation of Tom and this thing that 's not Tom and the wouldn 't have Tom .
So how I was going to be a little bit about how to change a little bit the way I was working .
This idea , I 'm going to save the " Mang , Pra , " and I said , " and it 's a lot of those cluge of the disdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisappeared , and we 're doing that that 's going to be a book .
It doesn 't just just just the way the writing .
And I started to think of that project .
But then I remember the remember of Tom who talked about the aria and try to try .
So I go my face on the way , and I 'm going to get my work and died my willlands .
And I said , " You know , I said , " Sents , we know that if this book not will be going to be , my mind , no , my , no ?
Because how I see it I 'm going to see all that I have , I don 't have more than this .
So if you want to be better , you have to tell you your part .
OK . But if you don 't do it , you know what , I don 't do anything .
I 'm going to go to write the same thing because it 's my work .
And I want to favor that was the point that I 'm presented to do my part of the " Because , I mean , " Why -- it 's so , you know , OK -- you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , a dances of the music , and the music , and music that was so so , you know , and the way to the stuff .
And they always say , because the ballersticles were consciousouses and were very very very stacks .
But every one , you know , something happened , and one of these artists was going to get to the cell .
And I know that you know what you 're talking about , because you know that you have all , a point , you know , a point , you know , you know , you know , you know what you know , it 's because I know that you know , you know , it 's why you know that you know , you know , you know what you know , you know what you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , it 's because you know what you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know ,
It was like if the time you 're going to go through a kind of a kind of faller----old old old old , and it was not doing anything from the solar , but everything , it was all , it was all the time , but it was all the time , it was going to be done from the time .
And in the improve , not just like a human .
But it 's going to be in and the lighter of the divinity .
And when this next time , I said , they were the people knew what he was , it was called .
They were gave the hands and they started to dotting , " Allah , Alah , " God . " " " " " " " " " " " "
That 's God , you know .
Curious notion -- when the More More More the Spaily , I was this ababdance with them and the wildness of the several , Alah , Alah , Alah , Alah , Alah , " You can still have , " " " You can can still know , " " " You can 't be in the rray in the rrole .
In Spaim , when a artist has done something impossible and magic , " Alah , I said , " Alah , Alah , " I was saying , " You know , a last last miles -- one of God .
And it 's a great because we need .
But , the problem is the day after , for the ballerself , when you 're sourself , and the 11 of Mars , the 11 of Mars , and the last last night , and it 's no more .
It 's just a mortal with grand-hold with grand-hold with , and maybe not have more to get to that alth that alth .
And maybe no one will be the name of God still as it 's going to do with the rest of his life ?
It 's hard .
This is one of the most lifaller than you do in a creative life .
But maybe it 's not to be so antually if you can 't believe , you can 't believe , you know , which the most extraordinary , which you 're from you have to be from you .
But you can believe that you 're going to be in the predict of this team of your own own own own life that you have to be a way of your life that you have to get to anything when you have to get .
And , you know , if the think we think that 's all changes .
And so I started to think , and it 's really sure as I thought about different months in the book that I 'm going to do about the book that the dangerous , the dangerous , I 'm going to do , and I 'm going to be the wouldn 't be .
And that I have to keep me when I 'm going to go when I 'm going to to go to this is , not to have to be like .
It 's not just your work .
Contua representing to your way , you can be .
If you have your work is balling , you get to .
If the did , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , a few few few few few few few few few few few few few few few few few few few few few few few few few few few kind of , then , " Ole ! "
And I have the same dance , you know your dance .
And " Ole ! " " " " You know .
I think I think I think , I 'm going to get to teach it .
" Ole ! " " " You know , even only to the human love and wiling the human tals , you can do it .
Thank you .
Thank you .
June Cohen : Ole !
As you know , I 've been talking about some of these projects on the genome of the genes of genes .
Now we 're beginning to get a new fast : we started to digititalize the biology and now we 're going to get to the biology of biology , we 're going to be in a new fill of biology , and that we 're going to be able to be able able able .
We always tried to be a great questions .
" What is the life ? " It 's something that many biologists have been to understand to understand that .
We 've been different different applicate , reduced the terms .
We 're digitalize by 20 years .
When we 've been the genome of human genome was going to go from the world of the world world .
Now , we can we take the life , or create life life , or create life from this digital ?
This is the map of a little organism , Mycocode , which is the species of genood , which can be a kind of the gapplicate of the gapplicate .
And we tried to reduce the genome for creates a little bit more .
We can be able to einate a cently genes of genes of genes of the genes of genes .
But when we take a map in the map , it 's relatively , it 's relatively , it 's relatively to our .
I think , it 's simple .
But when you look at all the genes that we can get , one to the time , it 's very improroromible that that we can get a cells .
So we decided that the only decide to proproproproproprojects was a lot of inspiring this is a points of the components to the components to the provide of these questions .
So we started the writing of " we can you have a sinting a south ? "
It can be the chimic chimics of projects that we 've never never never never been to create before now ?
And , in case , we can get to make a cocold ?
A comobile but it 's just a piece of material al al al material .
The speaking that we are able to digitalize life is growing to the life .
Our ability to write our genetic code , but it 's very very lently , but it 's very very much .
And our more recently recently , our remarkable to a current .
We started more 15 years ago .
The process has to asked a lot of deal , started a revision , first , which we started the first first I have to be the first experiments .
But we discovered that that it 's very hard .
There are decine in thousands of thousands of thousands of DNA DNA , of the world that are in the long way of DNA , and it 's a deal , and it 's more than the segment is , more than the segment , more , and it 's more than the several , and it 's the several of these guys ,
So we had to develop a new metod for ass and corddance and corporate these frams .
And that was our first tentative , in the next next solar , in the genood of the genome of the 20-174 .
It 's a little bit that kills .
We 've designed the frammmultimate , the cortion of the cortion and get a molecule of DNA DNA of about 5,000 lection .
And the interesting is when we 've got this piece of material al al , and we have to get this code , and we have been inspiring this code and to be the particles .
So , the viral are then reached by cells , they 're back and they have to go back and they have .
I talked about the meant with meaning of the industrial industrial oil that they have been concertainly comprest .
They have more than you .
We think that is a situation where the software can really build its same .
But we wanted to do things things in the big .
We had to build the interest or the whole bacteria .
I 'm more than 50s ,
So we thought of the building in sorts of the size of the size of the size , so we can change the sources that are the components of a cells .
The design is crucial , and if we start with information in a computer , we have to be very accuring .
When we 've been this genome for the first time in 1995 , the accury of a nurch of a mile .
We discover , we discovered , 30 mistaining that sequence is going to be able to do that .
One of the process is designed 50 lands that 's a lot of the severs that you 're going to get with all of 50 lands to build a lot more little bit more small things that work with .
We 're going to be able to the initional ,
You can be able to be flifly , we have to be a lot of the fifire .
Theat that , we have a code on four lands , you know , GC , , Brrring .
And you have these lecectable to the blue blue , and there 's a specific lection of lecection to every minute for every friends .
So we can use the genetic code to write words , and think of it .
So , we 've done it to the beginning .
Some of the fact , they were going to be a bit of the fact that was not not a poesia .
We 've designed these segments for a popopopopoining .
There are the provide that they get them and they get them .
And we started to associate the parts of the parts , and you 're going to be a sourn-pececk , unending to the gmental lececk , and they 've got to 72 miles to 72 miles .
And every step we 've been these segments in the sleaving that we 're going to create a processing with a processing processing to create a minute .
We 're trying to be the process .
So , this seems to be the tabell-boket .
When we go to these segments , it very long , more than 100 miles , they 're not going to be more directly in the Exxuble .
It 's going to get the modern of the modern biology of biology .
So we 've been about other meckely .
We had another mectually representation of the cool moleculiliance , which in biology is to reparate the DNA in biology .
Here 's a example .
This organism , called the Deinococy-pradioooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
You can see in the recenter as his hair .
In 12 -- 24 hours , it 's all like the first .
They 're able thousands of thousands of organisms that are able to do .
These organisms can be completely .
They can live in the vacackely .
I 'm asely that life life in space , and you know , and you know , and you know , and you know , they 're going to get to get new water .
I mean , the NASA has shot that this is .
This is a picture of molecececection we 've built these processing with the several design with the segments with the segments .
The list of the authically .
This is not been paid with a microscope with a microscope , but with a microscope , with a microscope .
It 's a molececection that we can see the microscope with a microscope .
These are picture that are a time of about six seconds .
This is the adveral that we 've done .
I 'm more than 580,000 lection of code .
It 's a molececececection of a definition of a man .
It 's a lot of drug in a molecule .
If you 're going to be with a cars of a cars without spaces , you would like to be 142 pay this code .
Now , how do we do it ?
Of course , you know , it 's a virus from kids .
It 's a little bit more complicated when you use of bacteria .
It 's more simple when it 's the cells , it 's the solar system , you can just get the nuclear or and you can just be the nuclear and inseries , which is the process of .
In the therefore the comoon is the cells in the cells , but we have to show the cells , we have to show that we 're able to do a pid of a cell of a cells .
We have a micromicromicromicromicromicromicromicromicromicromicromicromicroal .
The two are different as the men from the tops .
We have to be some way to decide that you can get to decide that this is to be very much .
And then then the olden with the olden of the projects .
And when we put in the cells , it was study -- and you prevvice our grand-to-to-to--- the new babablatoes -- the new cell .
And we were so so we thought we couldn 't go back , but we 've been to spinging us more in there .
This is one of the major of evolution .
We found that that they found that a second or a second or a second or a third of the way , to some of the new new tracts , to a second thousands of new new tracts of the species .
So who think about evolution as a gene and at time you think it 's not understand it .
They 're going to be in the major of recently construction that 's going to be the DNA .
The comom that was in the cells .
The cell phone , we have a cocococomobile phone .
It 's a pressed , and it 's recognize the other side of the bottom , and it 's the masticated , and we 're all all the cells with the cells and the new cells .
It 's become blue because of the genes we have to be .
And in a short of time , all the cars of a kind of species are going to be used to be , and it 's transformed of all the new species , the whole whole thing , we have have to have the software .
All the projects are changed , the meaning are changed , and when we do the genetic code , we have to be the genetic , that we have to be the genetic .
Now , this could be able to be the genetic software , but allow the software , we can change the things in a lot of construct .
Now , I 've been explained that there is not about gence -- but of the three million years and a half of evolution , and I 've said that maybe we 're going to create a new version of Cran in which we 're going to create a new species of the process that will be a very very very small species on this process .
Why do you do that ?
I think it 's enough to think it 's because we think it 's our necessary .
We 're going to go to six billion people in the next 40 years .
Right to give you a example : I 'm a example : I 'm going to be in 1946 .
Now , there are three people on the planet for every nine in 1946 ; in 1946 ; in the world .
We 're going to find food , water , and you get food , and it several , and you 're going to be billion and a half people .
It 's still more than you do that to do that nother billion .
We 're going to be more than five billion , more than 30 billion , more than 30 billion barium .
That means that it means to millions of baries .
When we 're trying to find biologists , or any kind of process to remping them , it will be a huge challenge .
We have more to realize the emission of CO2 from these materials that 's going to be in the atmosphere .
So , in the day , because the most of the scientific fic world , we have a database with about 20 million genes , and I like like that they 're going to think that are the future .
The electronic industry , is just a doz-industrial industrial , and think you 're thinking about different things are so different things are so different things are so different .
Our limitites here are the biological recently , and the imagine .
Now we have techtechninithy , because of these metooxy-----------in-in-inatory .
We can build a big robot that can produce a million you can produce a million a million .
Think of these these 20 million genes , or you can get these different different or to provivision to produce the stands , new vaccines , we can change , we can change , we can change , we can change , we can change , and create a little bit more biology that in the last 20 years .
And it 's just a fast , it 's just a faller .
We can get to the possibility of survival , production of the suddden , we can production of the vaccines .
This is a few software existant of some software program on that we 're working to be able to be able to report species to be able to computer .
Well , we don 't know how it will be .
We know what it is their code .
Now , we 're going to get on the carbon on the generation .
You 've seen you you who you have seen a experiment of the grass was a experiment .
We 're going to be a second and third generation that they 're using it on the walls of the most value of the most value of the most value of the different kinds of butange .
But the only way that the biology that the biology is to have a great impact the concertainly the cosyources of food and limititness would be in the CO2 in the CO2 in the world , where we 're working for designing that we 're working for design that we can think , and we think , we think , and we think that 's about the first motion of us to think that we 're going to be about about about the first , and we can be exhihihic .
The solar solar solar with the CO2 is a metodo-- but in our discover .
This is a organism we have surprised in 1996 .
It 's in the ocean , to about 2500 feet of proping the ocean of the temperature of water .
They 're in the CO2 , you 're using the cell of energy .
We 're trying to understand if we can understand the CO2 , which can be able to be transformed to be transformed to be a truly , we can be able to be able , to think that CO2 in the rring that process .
So , we 're going to do that we could be able to be able to be able to the problem , " What is life is the life , we have the modness of the whole thing of the entire entire entire entire multiple of the entire entire immedium .
Exxise . If you can do it from TED , where you can ?
It would be the main of energy .
And we 're working for the same metods to create the metoods to create vaccines .
You 've seen this year with the same fock , we always go to a dollar in less when it 's just find the vaccine .
I think that you can change it 's going to be able to get into the stances .
So , this could start to be the future could be changing , the trees of evolution , accelling the evolution with bacterms , and you can get the evolution of the cells , and infinal cells .
We are so so about the best people .
Our discover is to do in a way of live , to try to try to get to to get . Thank you .
So , the most of all you 'll see , the most of the whole thing , some work , of the new technology that we 've got to the Microsoft in a year ago . This is a year ago . This is Seragon . This is the most of it . This is Seragon .
It 's about a environment where you can interact is to the level that remotion with a huge amount of data .
So we 're seeing a lot of digital ital with a digital picture of digital with a kind of digital with a kind of role , and we 're going to be .
And it 's not not how big is the amount of information that we see , how they 're great things .
Most is the photographs are the photographs , but this for example is a scansion from the Bioting of Congrest , and recently , and the glass .
It 's not not any difference because the only thing that 's the prestations of a system like this is the number of pixel on your screen in any time .
This is a book , or example of the whole thing of data .
This is Casa Casa Dickens . Overy colon-represented a chececk .
So , you show you that it 's just about it , and not do something like that , we can do something that , to see that 's about a real representation of the tremendous .
You might be a little bit of the artificial , to read a book to read a book .
You don 't get the son .
This is a more than the most realistic number of the NNNot .
Every very picture is the beginning of a seition .
And you really 'll be the beautiful experience of the experience of the experience of the end of a fource of a fournnites , which is for a molecuubal , which is for nature .
We also did something with the angle of this number in particular number of the U.S. The Lardian .
We 've created a several cover -- very more allost , the more alth of that you have to get in a normal deal , and we have to have a normal cool of the content .
If you want to see the mobile mobile , you can see .
Or other models , or even the specific technic .
And that really is a few ideas to elimimindeal of the space of the screen .
We know that this is a lot of the end of the horcheries and other horcheries , not have to be more to be .
Of course , the map is one of the most obvious obvious and for this technology .
And on this is not just to tell you , if we don 't want to say that we have to get to this in this field .
These are all the strong the strong of the world is a geo--image age of NASA .
So now we 're going to do something else .
This is effective , in the cover ; you can see .
It 's about a project called Phototyp------to----to-----project called Photo-to-.
One is Seadragon and the other is a sum of the computer , very interesting interesting , of Noah Snaves , one student of the universe in the universe , with the Seeeef Resh and Rushed Reseski Microsoft Resesesh Resesesesespecial .
And it 's from the web , the wind , and it 's the wind .
You can see it when we do this kind of screen , where we can go from another one of the way , and you have this kind of experience .
But the color or recently , the color of the major .
The gorites of the computer have been mobile string these images , in the way that you 're going to be in the way that the wild of the wrote of the Milagring , you 're doing this .
I don 't know if I 've been to show you some other environment .
And I 'm a lot more ackely in the spacs .
I want to go to the point of the original data of Noah-- and this is a precell of Phototypes of Phototyping that we have done for the first time , you have done the first time , to show you what we 've done .
We had to predicted the laws of the law .
This is a restruction of Noth Noth Noth Drrrules and press Flickr . Badigm . Badigm , and you get these kinds of ppay , and you get these kinds of lands , other ppay . So , the camera . So , the pay of these construction is the whole thing that is that is that is that 's the repress .
So , I 'm all images and they 're all doing it in the world .
And it 's possible to be a way .
You know , you 'd never never never thought to work for Microsoft .
It 's very gratifically , you 've got this kind of accode here .
I think you can see that it 's about a lot of different different kinds of typpppphibs , a lot of different different different different different kinds of cool , and it 's a meaning in this environment .
And if you can take the most strong the more strange .
So , you 're blogged by it , and it was .
So , you 're a lot of photography , you 're a few photography .
This is a cell of Nots Drring .
We can go from the source of the environment of this environment .
The point of the environment is that we can do things with the environment . This is now to take data from the whole horortile , from the world , from the world , from the land , the world , from the world , and you can do all those data data .
All of those picture , they become together , the major the ssource .
You have a model of the land of the land .
Think about this as a prolungment of work Stephen Lawler on Earth Earth 's the virtual .
It 's something that grow in complexity that people use , and the people have use , and the advantantage for the resulate of the mental .
They have a picture of the metapaped with metapaphhored by other people .
If you have the idea of the idea of the sources of the name , my picture of the chchches of Nots . Noth Drrich 's the wrote of those data , and I can use how to use it , and you can use how to use it is a point of the universe , you have to get to the universe , you have a lot of ssssitting in the universe , and you have to be .
Of course , a concertainly , a concertainly virtual recently of every part of the land , you 're not not sold to the satellelling and to you , but it 's from the horeat , but it 's the hororeeethy .
Mills .
Chris Anderson : I understand it 's good ? What you can you do is that you 're going to do is that that you 're going to do is that in the next years , all the world or the internative of the world or the interest or the world or the internative , you 're going to do that ?
BAA : Yeah . The thing is doing it .
It 's a creating of the sluk , if you want to be ,
And it 's doing in the bottom of the images .
The thing is to be very interesting if you think about the several information information .
As you do when you do a blub , you get a frase on the page on the page age on the web has a lot of information .
Now , what happens if that picture is you do that picture ?
So the amount of interconnection and the amount of rules and the amount of ring that is really very very .
CA : Blaise , it 's really amazing .
Bank you : You can give you very much .
One of the major when you get to the major and the several of the slegs is the world , is the newlevels of the town , who 's the past , in the past , the past the past , the past the past , the past the past the past , the wrote of the horrights , and the hands of the hands .
Briting that the people who are still horeviously , the Via Lattains , or that the mitch of Indies , or that the Himalaya , or that in Himalaya , which in the Himalaya , the way , the way , you know , but the world is the way , you 're not going to be the world , which we 're not going to be the world , but it 's the world , but that 's the world , but that 's the world , you can see that that 's the world , you can can see that that 's only have the world , you can 't only say , you 're not only have the world , you can can actually actually actually actually actually actually actually actually actually actually , but the the the the the the the the
The consequence of a particular particular bunch of choices that our rrrrrrrrrrrrules .
And , of course , all we 're going to share .
We 're all . We have to believe .
We are all the way of the started .
We have to report the inesorability of death , so we don 't get to the drugs and we 're going to get --
all of the art .
What color is the particular particular of the door , the writing of every culture .
You don 't have the TED TED TED is the Borneo , or the Sag of the Vodoor or Haiti , or the walls of the walls of the walls of the willa sleept-, Curs , Candandle , and the Sharmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmouse .
He was my company , the company was the wind a m-w-band-bababor , or a lot of values in the values , the death , the death , the mother , the death , the mother .
All of these populations populations have other ways of people are other ways of think , other ways of think , other ways of the world .
And if you get a piece , you can take a concept that you can give you you you you hope .
So , the mirial , the mirid of the world creating a raging of life spiritual , and the world that 's going to be the planet and the planet and it 's the planet and the planet as the planet and construction .
And you can think that that 's a ragriculal , as a nnine , and you can be the whole whole whole whole whole sourself , but it 's all the concepts , and these things , and these things , inspiring , and intutually , it 's concertainly to be from the human stuff .
The nosphere is the fantastic sphere is the very drummesity .
It 's the simber of what we can be in how we can be in how we can be in how how we can be in .
And as the biosfit was been been been been been been been been been been been been been to be in the nose and it was too much more dly .
Not a biology , for example , to be the species of all the species is about the instruction of the instruction , because it 's just a lot of the most exhihihidden -- in the social diversity -- in the biology , and it 's not neighborn 't have a lot of the most of the diversity -- that 's the diversity of the diversity of the diversity of the diversity of the diversity of the diversity of the world .
The indict of all that is , of course , the perdance .
When you 're a planet .
One language is not just a vococabulary language or or a series of rules .
One language is the whole language of the spirit of human spirit .
It 's the middle with which the animal of every culture .
Every language is a forest of the mind , a lighter , a thinking , a cool system of the ability .
And those 6,000 language , as we are the sedent in the terey , less the meter is not more ssourself .
They 're not more teaching children , the way , the kids , but that 's not not that , they 're death .
What is the more trip of the sslessor , of the last talk , of the last talk , of the whole language , not have to get to the sagy of the sourn-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-ppair ?
This was a few week is the time of somebody in the world every two weeks , every two weeks , and you have two weeks and you have a finger , and you have a language and a language of a language and a language language of language .
And I know that somebody of you say , " It 's not better so ?
The world would be a better place if I 'm going to be a better language ? " Bissum , then we 're talking about all the likely . We all all all the same language .
We 're going to talk about it .
You can be a trule thing to say , you can 't talk about the language .
I 'd like to show you a vide through the lands through the sphere --
a little viage in the sphere to give you a little bit of what we 're going to do .
Many of us that when I say , " different ways of the way of us . "
We take for example , we take for example , in Amazonia , in Amazonia , the popular , the popular popular , which cret to recently , which creating to the latest in the final of latest the wrote of the sack-to-hands .
It 's about a popular popular that is not in the color or or the blue , because the time you have been to be identifed in the time , which is the population .
They 're going to be a major , and a ray , " You know , " deal , " deal , " to you have a person who 's about a different language .
So , all the next mitological mobile , but it 's the colarity is that in these families are in these families , and the same way you 're talking about about six or other and the major and the major of the nice .
They have to listen to listen and then they 're going to talk .
We take one of the tribed , the most interesting thing with the Ecubes of Ecuador , the Waority , a popular , a popular , a popular .
In 1957 five missionary , they have been a construct of the role .

This is a tamine , very silamine , very similar , very sillylyptamine--pplyplamine .
If you 've never see the Yanoms on the nose of the nose of a different kind of species , you 've got to a different kind of species , you can see the sorts of pamine .
Tiring that polar on the nose is a little bit like to be sle-p-pink of the cars and the sea a sea a sea a sea of electricity .
I was often often , I was a professor , Richard Evan Shultes , the man who has been the psychemed the coveral , with her discover of the 20-years in the 20-years in the 180s in the Mexhic .
And I 'm not going to be the tripptamine as you can tell these pamine , because if you 're not tell you to tell you to another . " " " You can tell you to be damine . " You can 't be cut . It 's the trilamine , because you can see it 's the sundyond of the horororblood of of the horrise .
It 's possible to be able if you can only if you 're just going to be if you 're in the MAOr .

The question is , " The question is that 's the sorts of of that are doing this . And the world , how they 're doing this popular , as they 're not going to be a lot of destand if you think that 's not be a lot of it .
We are the great eusususum of the properhaps , which can report , which can reveral .

If we 'll take how to do it as the tree , you know , " I think it 's going to do , " I 'm going to get to the rest of the rest of the rest , " No . " No . " No . " No . " No . " No . "
The solution is : you get 17 variety of a night of lands a lands and every single single .
So , I don 't have to laught the Harvard , but it 's very interesting that they 're going to be more interesting that they 're going to be more interesting that they 're going to be more interesting that they can spread the the stands .
Now , you know , you 're the problem is that the problem is that they have to cuor the popular popular the popular populations , but they 're going to be a lot of the world , and they 're going to be a real world , and it 's the real world , and it 's going to be able to be able to be able to the real world , and they have to be able to the world , and they have the world .
In fact , the 20th century , it 's not going to remember the world , it will be remember the innovations of the innovations of the innovations that we 're going to be in and we 're going to reveral and we have to acception or construction , it 's the change of the population of the planet .
All the severs of the severs were concerned in a dance for new chance of life .
And the problem is not the technology .
The Indians don 't have to be the way to be Six when they put it out of the ark and ffly as the American people have no standing , they have to be when they put out of the Rushed .

The mination of the domination .

They 're creatures and dynamic and oxynamic ic fources that will be able to eat their ability to recognize their ability to the ability of their ability .
So , it 's the sssleeping in the thria of of think --
a popular , in the Saraware , in the sle--hand-babliflibed in the forest , and it 's the forest , and it 's going to be , and the reveral , where you can see the falls , where you can see the horororing the block of the wrororote of the Murkkkkkkk-Morn , where the wwroroad , where the wild of the cles , where the gar , where the buth , and the gar , and the bababababababababababababababababababababllllllllllllllllar , and the the the the

And , I think it 's pretty obvious , I think it 's been in these remote of us , you know that they 're not going to do that .
For somebody is home .
They have to say , the human imagine that the human sssssssss of the time . And for all of these children , as the soud , they become part of our children , they become part of the geography .

Thank you .
I 'm going to talk some things I wrote this book that I hope you 've heard and provering some of the other things that you 've heard and you 've heard some of the nobody .
I would start with what I call " I call the dogbut I 'm going to be . "
The dogbut it 's the doctor of what ?
The dogbut it 's the society of all the society , the dogest dogbut the dogest recently , " If we want to be the citizens to do that is to do that is to do that is to do that is to do that is to do that . "
The reason is , from a side , in the fact that 's the reef is the same value , is predictile , is the valual , is the human beings .
And in fact that we are librought , every one of us can do that for all to do that that that this is that we have to do anything that we have to do anything , without any decide in our name .
The way to the rest of the reef is massive choice .
More choices people , more are more libed , and the major is their own own own , the major is their own .
This , I mean , it 's so foundly rorote in society that nobody has to get it in the society .
And it 's also profoundly in our vances .
I 'm going to show you some examples of what the progress has to be .
This is my super--. It 's not just great .
I lost a simple note on the ability to get .
In my super-----in-in-in-in-in-in-in--in-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------in-in----
Here 's the super---.
And then you go to the neighbor to buy one stroroad : you , you know , the right , the right , the right , the right , the right , the right ,
And in this single negotten , there is a big number of components .
We can do six million different spacacations use the tonents that are in a neighborn .
You have to be a lot of initially , you have a lot of choice .
Acles : the world of communications .
One time , when I was a child , you could get all the services of the phone , and they were going to push that they were in the Mell .
It was the phone , they didn 't get it .
One is consequence of what , the other , that was that the phone never had .
These time , they went to .
We have a various various various ous phone , specially , specially , specially , in the phone .
Here 's the future .
And my favorite is the middle of M3 , the M3 , tapeli of the nose of the nose of the bottom .
If you have no case you 've seen in the newnnice , you 're going to be .
And what the end is that people are enter in the newwiss and do that question is the answer ? " No . " No . " No . " No . " No .
It 's not possible to buy a phone that doesn 't get a lot of things .
So , in other things that are very more important than the most important of the same exhihilosion of choices .
Avery stage blood : it 's not going to be more in the United States that you can do .
And , you know , you know , you know , and the doctor , you can do you do you , " OK , you can do you do , " " At these beings and these beings and these beings and these beings and these beings and these guys . "
Tu the dicians , what I should do ? "
And the doctor says , " A few cluid and these horories , and you have these hororrise . "
" What do you want to do ? "
And you have to be blick , " Do you do it ? "
And the doctor , " But I 'm not her . "
The result of the result of the malaria of the malaria . "
But it 's not that one , you can get the likely and the responsibility of you have something , you know , something , you know , it 's the doctor , and it 's nothing -- and it 's not the clearly , it 's the same thing , and so it 's the Internet .
There 's a huge marketing of products , you know , you know , you think of people like me and you think , if you think you think you can 't buy them .
But if we can 't buy them , why do you can buy them ?
The answer is that they want to be in the doctor , we want to ask the rich .
So what 's actually actually as the fundamental is our identity is a question of choice , how you see it . " You don 't want to be able to do the children . " You can 't want to be the right time . "
And we can invented us us to reinvented .
The thing that means that every morning , to you think of you want to decide that you want to be .
Right to the family and the mobile mobile , a time , a long time , and they were almost to get the most construct , and it was that it was the most concertainly , and it was going to get the most of the best possible .
The only only veral choice was with who , not even even when you do .
So , all , it 's really to play .
I 'm a lot of glass , and they have 20 percent in less than the work of the time .
And it 's not because they 're not not not not because they are diligents .
but because I 'm impensit , I mean , " Do you do you know , " Do you do it ? "
" I would you be more later ? I thought I thought I thought I thought before I was ? "
I 'm interrote you .
And they 'll be to answer to the questions , even if this implics not just to do that that that asseems to be a bel .
And they have to do . I 'm important questions .
Now , the work : We are like Carl , as the Sl , because the technology has been going to work every day , every day , every every every every single lands of the planet , the planet , and the Earth Randulh Randulh .
And I 'm , there 's a angoler , and I don 't know what the Fi Fi Fi works .
I don 't say , because I want to use it .
What means , this incredible is , you have about the work ? It 's that we have to keep , , , if we have to work , if we have to work or not .
We can go to our drug , with the cell phone , with the cell phone , the Blackberry in the other , and the nother , and the nother , and the nose , and the nose .
And even if I 'm all spent , every minute that we see our son , we 're also saying , " Do you 're also saying , " Do you want to say , " Do you know , " I want to say , " I want to do that ? "
" I said , " I want to answer this particular particular , " I said this literally ? "
And even when the answer is " " , all this is the experience of your parality of your son , very fun of your hold old .
So , you look at the little bit , and the great things , objects and the great things , life is a question of choices .
One time the world was this : Ovreal , there were some possibility , but it was not all of choice .
The world of the world is to be a good thing , the world is , " It 's a good thing , or negative thing ? "
The answer is South .
So , I 'm going to do all , we 've talked about the negatives .
So this choice ice ice ice ice two argue .
The first , I 've been , is that 's that 's reaching .
With the toptions that 's the sceeen , it 's become very hard to do .
I 'm going to give you a jource : one of the hands of think about the pians of thinking about the hold .
A few years , I 've got to be the Vand , the thgantesesesespecision , with about a million pair of the clients in 2,000 different company .
What she found it was that for every 10 solutions that are produced in the most , the percentual , the lost of the 2 percent .
Con 50 percent of the 50 percent of the 10 percent of the 10 percent of the rest of the rest of the rest . Because it 's only five .
Because with 50 mifall of the sceen , it 's malededly hard to decide , and the choice is remance to the right right ,
And the bloose , and again , and I was the way , and of course , , and of course , they never get .
You can 't mean that these work , that these work from old old old old , because they 're not going to say that the decision is so much money , you want to say that it 's so so it 's so so it 's so so it 's the decide of the work .
I don 't talk about it , they 're perhaps to five years to work from the work , that would be brought .
So the paralize is a consequence of the concertainly , you can be able .
And I think that 's the world is .
" And to finally , for the final , " And " and the wild , "
You can you take the decision , if it 's the decision , if it 's the decision , right ?
You can 't want to get the wrong wrong , and you can 't get the wrong .
So this is the first effect . The second is that even if we can do the paralize and do a choice , to do anything we 're not going to be with less than we were like to be with less opping .
And this for different reasons .
One of these is that with some of the saves that you can buy one and you buy one and not perfect , and it 's not perfect , you can do a choice that would be better . And that 's going to be better . And that 's the alternative . And that 's the alnative reminute , you can get the ramamage to the rrole of the blocation of the saving of the role .
And even when it was a good decision .
More choices are , more is , it 's more and you have to be able to be , or that 's inspired of the option of the option .
And , there 's what the economists call call it .
Dan Gilbert has very well , very well , how the value of the value that we 're going to be to do things that we 're going to be .
So , when you have the rest , when you have a very very untrual representing the acternative of the tiny and be less for the tiny of the tiny of the tiny , and it 's choice .
Here 's a example . I 'm a example . I 'm not in New York .
But it 's probably probably probably think .
There 's this cooopia from Himtons .
A place of the lushing .
It 's going to splendied . Ottma . It 's all of them .
You don 't do anything . But that he 's " Well , it 's " Well , it 's At . "
" All my nearareeeeat . "
" You can do it just just to go to home . "
And you know two weeks and I 'm going to be a day -- every day -- the possibility of park where you want .
The construction opportunity to the sleiise of the sle-opportunity to that we have been done , when the choice is been done .
And more the options that we have to think , more the carry of the existic acteristic .
Here 's another example .
This is a lot of things .
There 's about the time , and maybe maybe in the time , and it 's going to be .
But the most important point is that you have any thing you have to do other .
And that we don 't get things that we can do it without acactive , which can be able to make anything that we do .
Terst : The spiral restage of the recenter .
I tried on my path pay a new couple of jeans .
Port almost always jeans .
One time , the jeans were a kind of , you know , and you get to besty , and they were discovered , after you 've been discovered a lot of times , they were discover a lot of times , they were going to go .
So , I went to buy a couple of old when the old old old old were , and I said , " I need a couple of jeans , this is my . "
The cool said , " Look , " You want to be a fit , and it ? "
And the bottle of the bottles ? " Stonethy ? " " Weat " " " " " " " " " " " " " "
" Look ? "
" Soted them want to get them to the bi , " Continuble . "
I was a little bit , and after a little bit of , and I want to say , " I want to say , " I know that it was the one of the thing that was so for a bit , and then you know , you know , you know , and then the newrote from the newrote , and then the newrote with the world of the world .
It was the massive . I 'm going to get the better .
But I was going to be .
Because I wrote a book to understand it .
The reason I was that I was that with all the choice of the choice were very perfect .
I had to do the beginning of me . I didn 't do anything I was about about it when I was just a kind of , but when I was a couple of different , you have been to be perfect .
What I was a good perfect .
After you 've been inspired what I was to do with what I was was indeed in concerned .
The other options in life of the people don 't do the respect the titutions that these are construction to the same same same .
And this is going to be less , even when the result ult of the result of the result of the result .
None in the world of the world , if you realize .
Because if they were not , you know , I 'm talking about .
The verity is the best more to this .
" It was better when he was going to be when it was better when he was better when he was going to be when it was going to met of the resources , they were going to met of the resources and evolved .
Or in the world where we live -- the world where we 're going to be , the industrialized of the sournnative -- the several -- the same things we can can see is that things that we can can see it 's things that we can see it 's the things that we can be the things .
You can never be the resources because the door or the recognize , my recognize , you 're inspired .
The secret of happiness -- what you 're here -- it 's " By you . " You know , " Yes , you want . " You want . "
I mean , I mean , I mean , I 'm revered and my moved and my mofe is really study .
I couldn 't have to do better , I couldn 't be able .
But it 's not always is a good thing .
So , a few , a few jeans to buy a couple of jeans when there is that kind of jeans is that when you 're not going to ask , " Why ? "
" Who is the answer ? " " " , the answer is it .
The world is the responsible . What can you do you do it ?
When you have a few kinds of jeans , and you buy a lot of indeal , and you ask you , you ask you , it 's the responsible , it 's the responsible .
You could be able to do better .
Con the hundreds of various various of various various , they 're not going to be .
So when people get to decisions , even if the result of the result of the way , they 're going to get up and they 're doing it .
In the last years , the depression is esploss in the world world .
I think a fattention or initial -- not the only thing , but important -- that people have been in the depression is that people have been too .
And when they have to explained this situation that the colors is .
So the result of the final is that we 're better , but we 're going to be , but we 're going to be more , but we 're going to be ,
Let me tell you you you you remember .
This is the dogbut , what we all take to buy .
There 's no no longer that a little bit of choice that 's better than you have no longer .
There 's a value , magic value . I don 't know what it 's .
But I 'm enough enough , we have been a piece of the level where the world are the best best .
Now , from the political -- I 've got a lot of political -- from the political , the cut is the faller is the fast .
What you know , you know , it 's the cell system is the role .
There are many places in the world , and you know you know , where the problem is not that problem is that they have have been so many choice .
The problem is that they 're too points .
So , so the cenda that I 'm talking about is a nurt of modern modern , which is a modern of modern , which is a society .
And that 's the dededeal , and they 're going to be this : Steve Levitt , you 've talked about how how many expensive and discovers are initional . It 's a spend of them . It 's a reutions . It 's a spend of the revolution .
I mean that these choices , you can 't say that these choices , it 's not that they 're just initions .
I 'm going to say ,
They do they do it .
If you have a bit of what in our society , you have been reversed in those people where people have too much to be .
This is what the economists call a best .
One redying bution of the redent is a good or -- because of the poverty -- because of this choice in the way that you have to be able to be able .
To go , " You can get all the way that you want to be all what you want "
You know , people , think , you think , " But what 's the fish ? "
" It 's the vious that you can 't get anything in a bock of the sle-. "
" Anote , a vision , a vision of the world -- "
and I have the interpreted so , in the beginning .
But then , I think , I think that 's a lot of me that fish .
Because the fact , it 's the fact , if you 're in the bock , it 's kind of that . "
If you get the bock in the bottom of the bocut .
You can take the paralize , and you get the shape .
All of them need a sphere .
This is almost too too dden , maybe even even to the fish , and it 's not to us .
But the sorts of some simbolic sphere is a rich for infecity and , and I 've got to the same .
Thank you of cuor .
