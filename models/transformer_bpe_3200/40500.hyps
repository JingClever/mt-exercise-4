Last year I showed this slides to show that the glad the arthtical calott , which is for almost three million years had the size of the 48 United States , which is remarkable to 40 percent .
But this subvaluable to the gravity of the problem because it doesn 't show the spor of the ice .
The Atical calotter is , in a sense , the clear heart of the global climate system .
You expands up the winter and you retreat it .
The next slide is going to be a quick , in the last 25 years .
Places have been signed in red .
As you see , they expand to the blue .
That 's the ice in the winter , which is retreatment .
You can see that so-like , five years , or more , is , as a blood , which is like blood , which is like blood , which is like blood , which is in the body .
And in 25 years , so , in 25 years , so .
This is a problem because heat the interest heat the ground , where there are enormous amount of coal , where there are enormous amounts of carbon congelated carbon microbes .
It turns out to the totality of global warming , that amount of global warming could double , that amount of the amount of not back .
In some little laghi 's little profound laghi is already rebold off the water .
The professor Katey Walter of the University of Alaska was a team in a pressed bottom by a team in the winter .
Video : Wow ! Al Gore : Wow ! Al Gore : You 're going to be .
A reason is that this termal exchange changer Groenland from the northermorth .
This is a glacial regime .
It had never reached the similar .
This is the Kangerlussuaq , in the southwest of the Groenland .
If you want to know how it 's the sea level for the sea level of the sea path of the sea .
These current current .
Another part of the planet : Antarctica , the greater block of ice the planet .
The last month scientists have dichieved that the billanest is in negative , and that the Western Antarctica , which pogers on some islands , is particularly rapidly quickly in the mouth of the leaving leaving of the mouth .
Excellal in the miles of the acque , like in Groenland .
Sulla Himalaya , the third greater block of ice , you see new laghi , which few years ago were glaciers , which few years ago were glaciers .
40 percent of the world population was a bad water to the water half of the water from that melting .
Sulle Ande : this glacier is the source of this city .
It 's increased it .
But when it comes , the same thing is going to be a bad water .
In California , the snow , in the Sierra Nada is decrecreased 40 percent .
idrics are in crisis .
The predictions , as you have read , they 're pretty good .
The growth of the world is a remarkable to the world of intilt .
The environmental disaster environmental disaster , and without precedented .
Four times more numbers in the last 30 years than previous previous 75 .
This is a very unsustainable way .
If you look at it in the context of the historic if you can see the consequences .
In the last five years , we 've added 70 million tons of CO2 , 25 million tons of tons of the ocean every day .
Look at the East Pacific area , the East Pacific , to the west , and to both the parts of the subcontinent , where there 's a rootal impoverty of oxygen in the ocean .
The most of global warming , together with deforestation , which is 20 percent of it , is the use of fossisil fuel combustible .
The oil is a problem , and carbon is even worse .
The United States is one of the two more emissions , together to China .
And he was proposed to build a lot of other central coal .
But we 're seeing a way of the way .
These are the anullated projects over the last few years and some green proposers of green alternative projects .
Anyway , there 's a political fight in our country .
The carbon industries and oil have spent 250 million dollars in the last year to promote carbon , which is a oxymal .
That picture reminds me of this picture , I would remember something --
So , Natal Virl , where I live , there was a loss of 3.8 billion lifetime of carbon dioxide .
You may have seen it on news .
This is the second bigger flow of these these these screams in America .
It happened around the Christmas .
The advertising of one of the carbon industry was this .
Video : I 'm going to do it .
It 's abundant here in America , and it grow our economy .
Frosty carbon is increasingly clean .
It 's good price , and it 's really good , and working on the stypend .
Al Gore : From here , it 's a lot of the West Virginia .
The bigger bigger mineral society on the mountains is Massey Coal . This is his administrator .
Video : Don Blankenship : I 'll be clear -- Al Gore , Nancy Pelous , Nancy Pelosy-Pelious , " Don 't know what they 're talking about .
Al Gore : So the Alleance for Protexture of Clima has launched two campaign .
This is one of them , a part .
Video : Acore : Acy : ALergy : ALergy : Acy : Actually , the climate change as a sery threat to our business .
So , our priority is to invest a lot of money in a bunch of money in a public effort to make public and confused the truth .
In fact , carbon is not spending .
We think it 's clean -- it 's also a good prosm .
So not package of climate change .
Let me do it .
Video : Acore : Carbone -- you heard a lot of it .
So let 's take a turn into a horry to the current structure for how much carbon .
Straordinary ! The machines are a little noissue , but this is the sound of the puly-carbon technology technology .
The carbon consumption consumption consumption is between the main of global warming , but the remarkable of carbon technology that you see changes everything .
You look at this : this is the hdierglass .
Al Gore : Finally , the positive is connects to the economic issue and the national security .
Video : The America is in crisis ; the economy , national security , climate crisis .
The bottom that connects all : our depending on fossil fuel , like fossil fuel , like carbon oil .
Now , but , there 's a new audace , a new result for it .
An America : 100 percent of clean energy , in 10 years .
A plan to put America to work , to make us sure , and help stop , and helping to stop global warming .
Finally , a solution that is to do our problems .
Repower . You know , more Really .
Al Gore : This is the last .
Video : It 's about to rehold energy to America .
One of the fastest ways to bring up the dependeniable of the combustible that we 're killing our planet .
Compars : The future is here . Vent , sun , a new energy network .
Novi investment for two : Novi investments for very well retribes .
Repowerful America . It 's time to be realists .
Al Gore : A old proverbio African proverbio says , " If you want to go fast , go to yourself .
If you want to go together , you go together . "
We have to go far , fast .
Thank you very much .
Last year at TED , I introduction a bond a TED LHC .
And I promise to turn to you on how the machine works .
So here I am there . And for the one that was not there , the LHHC is the biggest scientific experiment ever we 've been trying to -- 27 miles of circumstan-circumstances .
His task to reconstruction the conditions that were present less than a billion in the universe -- to 600 million times a second .
This is just ambique .
This is the Ginevra 's machine .
We 're seeing this min-Big Bang in the detectors .
This is what I work on . It 's called ATLs -- is about 44 feet and has a 22 foot diameter diameter .
This is an ATL-spectacular picture of AS in building , so you can see proportions .
Ten , 10 , a To September , we accesum the first time .
And this picture was taken by ATLS .
It was because of immense festegation in control .
It 's a picture of the first of particles that had done all the way around the LHHC , entering in collision , deliberately , with a part of the LHHC , and spread particles in the detector .
In other words , when we saw that image 10 settember , we realized that machine was a great wictory .
I don 't know if this was going to be able to do more or this , when somebody went to Google and saw that the initial page was this .
That means we 've had a cultural impact beyond to the scientific impact .
About a week later , there was a problem with the car , and it had to these sleep .
These flaps , 13,000 pocket when the machine works at the most power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the rest of the power of the rest of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the massive power of the power of the rest of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the massive power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the
Now , the technical technical between you will look at the files and say , " It 's not true . They 're too overfiles . "
And they can do it because when they 're very coside-called super---file super-convictims .
So , at least 271 degrees , at least a lower temperature to the space between stars , these short can bring that current .
In one of the juncy of the most novehicle magnetic , there was a defect of a factory .
So the file , and then you surrounded the 13,000 herself amps met a sudden they met an electrical resistance .
This was the result .
Now , this is even more impressive if you think that these magnetes weighs than 20 tons , and that you 've been moving about 30 initions .
They were damaged about 50 magnetes .
We had to take them , what we did .
We 've been restinated them and fixed .
Now they 're going back to the whole sub-land .
By the end of the LHHC is going to be back to the LHHC is going to be a whole new integral .
We 're going to access it , and we expect to get to the data or July , and we 're going to keep the adventure of the universe that are .
Now , of course , in a certain way , these accidents reaccended the debate on the value of science and engineering in front of the engineering in front . It 's easy to be to conviction .
I think that it 's so hard , the fact that it 's the value of things like LHHC .
I would like to end with the words of one English scientist , Humphrey Davy , which , I guess , in defense of inuseful experiments of his pupille , his pupille was , and he said , " Nient is so dangerous to progress that our triumphony for the progress of the human mind of the world that we don 't have any new people that we can 't be a new monsters , and that we don 't have new ,
Thank you .
I want to start asking you to think about when you 're children , played with the morning in the moroncines .
As you know how to get them and get them , and take them , and get them , and you know , you know , you know , you know , and you know , you know , and you 're going to do that , and you know , you know , and you know , you know , you know , and you 're going to be able to think of solve problems .
space reasoning is a deeply connected to the way we understand most of the world around us .
So , from the information usulity of our interaction with physical objects , together to my own Pats , and my collaborator Jeevan Kalanithi , I started to ask , " And if , when we use a computer , instead of having the only cursor of mentionally , we could fight into a desktop , we could trust a fight into a desk, we could deal with a information to both hands ,
and to put it up to our please ?
The question was so interesting that we decided to explore the answer , building Siftable .
In a few words , a Siftable computer is a great interactive computer .
In a few words , a Siftable computer is a great interactive computer .
You can move them with their hand , they can see " between them , you know , feeling their motion and they have a screen and a wireless screen .
But most importantly , they 're physical objects , like the morning , you can just move in it .
Siftable is an example of a new ecosystem tools to manipulate digital information .
And as they become more physicists , awful , of the movement , of the other , and as they become more physicists , and as they become more physicists , of how we 're moving them , we can explore new things .
I 'll start with some simple example .
This Siftable is configured to show video : if you 're going to stop it in a direction , the video will rotate this , if you go to the other side .
These interactive portraits of the other people .
If you face them , you know , you 're interested in what they 're around .
If you 're circumsted , and they can act a little bit a bit .
If you 're circumsted , and they can act a little bit a bit .
They also have their movement and intilment .
And then we realized one of the interesting implications of the interaction was to be able to use communal gestures , for example , to push a color like if it was a liquid .
In this case , we have three Siftconfigurs as a buch bucks and I can use them to fix the central color in that central , where they mix .
and I can use them to put them to fix color in that central , where they 're mischieve .
We 're too much , we can put a little bit a place .
There are also beautiful possibilities of learning , like language , the mathematics , where people can try to do things very quickly , and see the results where people can try to do things very quickly .
I 'm now --
This is a Fibonaccount that I do with a program of equations .
Here we have a game of words that 's in Scarabeo and Boble .
Pratically , at every turn-scary , at every Siftable , Pratically , at every turn-range reef a letter to each turnal , and as you 're looking for a dictionary words .
Then , after about 30 seconds , you have a new letter set of reading and new possibilities to try .
Thank you .
Here 's the children came to Media Lab , I did so that they tried them and I went to a video .
They 're very plexed .
And one of the interesting things of this kind of appliance is that you have to not giving people a lot of education .
You just say , " Compons of words , and they know exactly what to do .
Here 's the other people that try it .
This is our younger tester header there , right there on the right .
It was actually wanted to impillling them .
They were only morning in the moroncles for him .
Now , this is a appliation of a interactive cardboard .
We wanted to build a tool for the learning of language . He 's Felix .
It can inserse new characters in the scene , by liftable to the Siftable .
It can inserse new characters in the scene , by liftable to the Siftable .
So , he 's going to get out the sun .
Video : The sun is smile .
David Merrill : Now it took a tretor in the scene .
Video : The arange .
Bel work ! Yeah ! Yeah !
So by eight and put them in close to the neighborhood ,
Video : Bau !
-- by inventing their story .
Video : Hi !
DM : It 's a story with open open , and it can decide him as you 're going to .
DM : It 's a story with open open , and it can decide him as you 're going to .
Vola . : From it away , right .
DM : The last example I have time to show you a time is a tool , made of recent , to sample and and executive music .
is a device , recently , which is a recently , to sample music .
Siftable here to sound as a base , low-bottom and bacteria .
Each one of these has four different variations , and you can choose which to use .
You can also put these sound in a sequence to get to you in a sequence to get to your pleasure .
And you just move it by by making a sound and a sequence .
These are effect you can control from the live , like the reverbero and filter .
The next one of a particular sound and then fixed claws .
And then there are general effectively , like time and volume , which is applied to the entire sequence .
Let 's look at how it works .
Video : We 're going to start putting a base in two Siftable , we 're going to build it in a series , we can add it in a series , we add the other base .
Now , I 'll put a bottom line .
Video : I 'll add the percussion --
Video : And I 'll put the filter to the bacteria , so I can control the the live effect .
Video : I can quickly quickly the entire sequence by by by the way .
Video : And I 'm going to add the bottom and give the lower filter to give more expression .
Video : I can recombine the sequence to the sequence " to flight . "
So I didn 't have to plan it before , but I can improvise , making it longer or .
And now , finally , I can spend the whole sequence by the whole bond the Siftable .
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is to build new mo-up mo-up interfacial , and more resempowered to how our brain and body .
And today , I 've had time to show you one of the results of this path , and also some chance we 're trying to bring out of the lab .
The concept I want to transmit is that it 's coming to this new generation of designed to interact with digital media , which will bring information in our world in the way we want .
Thank you very much .
I don 't see the time to talk to all of you .
I 'm a writer .
I 'm going to take a books is my profession , but it 's more than that , obviously .
It 's also love and the fascination of my life .
And I don 't expect that it can change .
But , said , something particular happened to my life and my career , which has taken me to wealthy the whole relationship with this work .
The particular thing is that I recently written this book , this biography called " Mangia , Ama , Ama , " which , diversally from my previous books , for some reason why in the world and became a big , besseller sennial , international besseller .
And the result is that everywhere , people treats are being being as you were convicted .
Really -- you know , you know , you know , you know , you know ,
They 're all worried to me and they say , " Don 't you fear to you not anymore ?
You don 't you fear to keep writing for all life without being able to create a book that can be important to someone ? "
that can be important to someone ? "
It 's insurance , you know .
But it could go worse , and I remember that over 20 years ago , when I started to say , I was a teams of the people -- I wanted to be a writer .
I would go to the same reaction that it was based on the fear .
And people said , " Don 't you could not be able to success ? "
Do you don 't you fear that the ulient killed you ?
Do you don 't have this wearing to the whole life without nothing to come up and die on a bunch of the infrankly sub-dreams with the blood of loving with the failure of losing ? "
So , you know .
The answer -- the short answer to all these questions is , " Yes . "
Yes , I 'm afraid of all those things .
I 've always been fear .
And I also feel about a lot of other things that people can 't guess .
As the algae and other things .
But , as as much to write what I thought , and I would ask me , but I was why ?
Is it rational ?
It 's logical that anyone should expect to be frightened by a job that you feel born to do .
But what 's so particular in the companies that makes us nervous health is about health of the mental health of the other people don 't do ?
How my father , for example , he was a chemist engineer and I don 't remember one in his 40 years of activity in which he was asked if he was afraid to be an engineer ?
And so , there was never -- that block of engineer John , what does it happen ?
He didn 't work like that , you know ?
Onestly , chemists , chemicals as a group have not certainly , in the centuries , warning the reputation of the depressive being alcolied .
We writers , we have enough this reputation , and not only writers , but creativity of all kinds of kinds of things , we have this reputation of being enormously unstable .
And it 's not remains to look at the sad , or the deaths of creative magnificments that , only in the 2th century , they die young people and often die for hand .
And the ones that you don 't have to be suicidated by their dundunges .
Norman Mailer , before he died , in the last interview said , " Every little bit more " an amazing affermation about the work of their life .
But we don 't get out of it , because we 've heard these things so long that we 've heard these things so long that in some way , we 've been really interior and accepted the notion that creativity and suffering are in some way of you and that art , at the end , it will always be a likely .
And the question I want to ask all to this today is : are you agree with this idea ?
And you 're all right here -- because also looking at it from a centimeter of distance to me not good for this support position .
I think it 's hated .
And I think it 's dangerous and I don 't want to see the perpetuated perpetuated in the next century .
I think it 's better encouraging our big creative minds to live .
And I certainly know that , in my case -- in my situation -- it would be very dangerous to start fuse to the dangerous smooth to the circumstances in which I 'm in my career .
It 's really -- you look at it , I 'm pretty young , I have about 40 years old .
I still have about four worlabs .
And it 's very likely that anything to write in now , it 's going to be judged by the world like the work that came out of my last book .
I 'm going to be , because we 're all more or less friends here -- it 's likely that my greatest success is my own my shoulder .
Oh , Gesus , who thought !
You know this is the kind of thinking that leads a person starting to drink in the nine of the morning and I don 't want to do it .
I would keep doing this work that we 're going to keep doing this work .
So , the question becomes , how ?
And so , I think , after many reflectively , that the way of working to keep writing is to create a psychological construction , right ?
I have to find a way of security between me , which I 'm writing , and my natural anxiety about which reaction that I 'm going to get to . And , I was trying to do it all over the year , trying to find other society to see if they could have better ideas have better and more healthy ideas to see if they could have better ideas more and more healthy ideas to see if they could have better ideas have and more healthy ideas to see if they could have the best ideas have and more healthy ideas to see if they could have the best
how to help creative people to deal with the inerent risk of emotivity .
And that research took me to the ancient Grek and an old Rome .
And I 'm going to go back to the circle and then it comes back .
In the ancient Grecik and an ancient Grek , people didn 't seem to believe that creativity came from men , OK ?
And he thought that creativity was this spirit watch divine and that they were going to come to the men from some source and unknown , for distant reasons and unknown , for distant reasons .
The Greeks called the spiriters of creativity " demon " demon " demon " demon " demon " . "
Socrate , wonderful , he believed to have a demon wisdom that was wisdom from distant .
The Rooms were of the same idea , but they called that kind of spirit without a genius .
which is great , because Roands didn 't think , because Roands didn 't think a genius was particularly smart .
They thought that a genius was this kind of divine , which was actually believed in the walls of an artist , a little bit like the elpho Dobby , and that was going to see the job of hidden , and I came out to see the job of the artist and models the result of that work .
Extal -- here 's the distance of which I talk about -- that psychologists that you protect to your work .
And everybody knew that was how it worked , right ?
So the anti-artists were protected to certain things , like , for example , the too much narcion , right ?
If your work was exceptional , you couldn 't take all the place , all of you know that you were helped to this incorporate genius .
If your work failed , it was not all your own , right ?
Everybody knew that it was your genius to be a inable .
And so people han conceived creativity in Occident for a long time .
And then the Renaissent came and everything changed , and it 's all about this big idea ; we put the human being the center of the universe above all the mysteries and without leave space creatures that write by divinity .
This was the principle of rational and people started thinking that creativity were completely from the issues to be completely from the issues .
And for the first time in history , you started to refit to this or artist as a genius that one person with the genius .
And I have to tell you , I think it was a big mistake .
I think that allow someone , a simple person to believe that being as a recipient as a source , the essence and the source of all the mysteries , creativous , unknown as a file , unknown as a file as a big file to give to the fragile human psychologists .
It 's like to ask someone to to ingoiate the sun .
Demot and reaches completely ego and creates all these inexible expectations on performance .
And I think it was this pressure that I 've been destroyed to 500 years old .
And , if this is true , and I think it 's , the question becomes , and now ?
Can we do that differently ?
Maybe you can go back to a more antial understanding of the relationship between human and creative mystery .
Or maybe not .
Maybe we can 't sing 500 years of rational thinking in a talk about an 18 minutes .
And there 's probably people in the audience that would have to be legitimate to the notion of the news , you know , you know that they follow the next people are brought to the next people by spend of their projects .
I 'll probably not really convince you all about this .
But the question I would like to ask is -- why not ?
Why don 't we think about this ?
Because it 's more sense of everything else that I 've ever heard to explain the exabsolutely impremobility of the creative process .
A process that , as anyone who ever tried to do something -- so , basically , everybody 's here -- you know , you 're not really doing it .
And in fact , it can sometimes sometimes , it can be completely paranormal .
I did this meeting recently with the extraordinary poetry Ruth Stone , who has now 90 years old , but that was a poetd for all of life and told me that during his childhood in the rural Virginia , working out in the camps , and feel it , inside the camps .
He said he was like a frageous air train .
And that was rotating her to the landscape .
He felt it , because he was to actually tremendous the land under its feet .
He knew he had one thing to do to do at that point and was of , he was of running as a match . "
And so it 's going to go home and it was going to go from this poetry , and it would not have to take a little piece of paper and a matt enough , and a matt enough match , and it would harvesting it and grabbing it on the page .
And sometimes you couldn 't be fast enough , so it correcves and correct and runs without able to get to the house and the rotolar the rotoling through and he would continue to rotolate through the landscape , looking , as she said , " another poet . "
Then there were those times -- this piece of the time I never forget this -- there were moments in which almost losing , OK ?
So , he was running home and he was looking for paper and the poetry , and he was looking at the time , and then he said , that he was like , and then he said , that he was like , and then he would fit up with the other hand and steffed it .
He used to poetry the poetry from the tail and remaining her body and transclined it to the page .
And in these cases , the poetry would be presented on the perfect page , from the last word to the first one .
So when I heard it I thought -- it 's crazy , it 's exactly the equal of my creative process .
Not all my creative process -- I 'm not a convict !
I 'm a mulo , and my way of working is ; I 'll wait up to the same horarian every day and play and go through the goffly .
But even I , in my testing , I 've been striped on that thing , sometimes .
And I guess that many of you the han .
You know , even though the work and ideas came to me from a certain source , you can 't know that .
And what is this thing ?
And how can we relate it to it in a way that we don 't lose your head , but , what do we have to do you stand skie ?
As I 'm going to be , the best contemporary example I have is the musician Tom Waits , which I interviewed different years ago for a newspaper .
We were talking about this , and you know , Tom , for the majority of life is the incarnation of the incarnation of the incarnation , trying to control , dominating these species of impults .
But then he got , he cry , and he was driving on a road in Los Angeles , he changed everything for him .
It was going to fast and everything , and it 's all this little bit of melody , which is coming in in his head as inspiration , and it wants to , elusive , and it wants , and the desider , but not knows how to take it .
It 's not a piece of paper , it doesn 't have a matt , it 's not a register .
So he starts to hear this kind of old anxiety growing up in him , " I 'm going to lose , and I 'm going to hurt obsessed by this song , and I 'm going to lose it up .
I 'm not good enough and I can 't do it . "
And instead of going to go to the panic , stop .
And I 'll be able to do that , and did something completely new .
He just just just looking at the sky and said , " Scuses , I 'm not driving ? "
" Do you think it can write a song now ? "
If you really want to exist , you go back to a more opport when I can take care of you .
Otherwise , you 're going to important to someone else today .
You go to disturbing Leonard Cohen . "
And his work changed after this .
Not the work , the job was still obscure as a always .
But the process , and the heavy anxiety was remained to the genius , which was going to take a remain , the genius would be a remain , and get rid of where it was , by doing that , by realizing that it didn 't have to be a suck and remainly remained .
but you know this peculiar , wonderful bizarre collaboration in a conversation between Tom and this strange thing that it wasn 't Tom .
So , as I heard that story started to change a little bit the way I worked , and I had a rescued .
This idea , I was saved when I was writing " Mangia , " Ama , " and fall into one of those dispersed disperation where we 're going to work on something and we don 't know and we can 't start thinking that it will be a disaster , which is going to be the worst book that 's going to be the worst book that ever written .
Not only not just bad , just the worst book written .
And I started thinking about therefore I started to throw this project .
But then I remember Tom , I was talking to the air and I tried to it .
So I got my face up to my face on the dark and I was comments to a empty of the room .
And I said to high voices , " Sort , what , both of you know that if this book is not going to be bright , no ?
Because I 'm going to put all that all I have , I don 't have this one .
So if you want it to be better , you have to show you and do your part .
OK . But if you don 't do it , you know what , I don 't do that .
I 'll start to write the same because it 's my job .
And I would like to do for my part of the things that I 've presented to do my part . " Because -- at the end is so , OK -- it 's so , OK -- it 's going to -- and it was a centuries , dances and music that went on and sacred to go up to the daaba .
And they were always magnificent , because dances were professionals and they were great .
But every while , rarely , something happened , and one of these artists had become translent actually .
And I know what I 'm talking about , because I know you 've all seen this , one point , a performance that you all have seen , a performance .
It was like the time , and the dancer walked through a kind of landed , and it was not doing anything different from usually , as 1,000 night before , but everything was trained .
And suddenly , it doesn 't only look at the same as a human .
But it 's off the diinside and the lit of divinity .
And when this happened , the time , the people knew what was , they called it .
They were going to kill their hands and start to sing , " Allah , Allah , Allah , God , " God , " God , " God , " God , " God , " God , " God , " God , " God , " God , " God , " God , " God , " God , " God , " God , " God , " God , " God , " God , " God , " God , " God , " God , " God , " God , " God , " God , " God , " God , " God , "
That 's God , you know .
And it was a great historic note -- when the Spain , I got this habitude with them and the pronounced it to their own and pronounce changed in the centuries , Allah , " to " Ole , " , " which you can still hear in the corrids or flowing .
In Spain , when a artist did something impossible and magic , " Allah , " Allah , " Allah , " " Proy , " incomprehensible , " ectackle -- a God 's flowing .
And it 's really why we need it .
But , the problem comes the day , for the dancer , and the dancer , when you wake up and discover that are the 11 in the morning of Martedesh and the shouldn 't be .
It 's just a great mortal with the ginocchies , and maybe it 's not going to be able to get that height .
And maybe no one will sing the name of God as it 's still going to go , and what so much has to do with the rest of his life ?
It 's hard .
This is one of the most painful recognized to do in a creative life .
But maybe it doesn 't have to be so much angoshy if you can 't believe , in the mostly extraordinary to be being from yourself .
But you just believe that you 're being being prested by an inimaginable function of this indeed part of your life that you have to go to someone else when you 're finished .
And , you know , if we think that this all changes .
And so I started thinking about it , and it 's certainly how I thought I thought about it for different months during the book that I 'm going to afterwards , dangerous , attesissue , attesissues , waiting for the followed my big successful success .
And what I have to keep telling me when I feel electritried by this is , not to do it .
It 's not just your work . It 's your job .
It 's a presenting to your side , any of your side , any can be .
If your work is dancing , balling .
If you 're going to be , absurd to you , and it 's a decide to leave a few kinds of wonderful , for one moment through your effort , then , " Ole ! "
Otherwise , you do the same dance .
And " Oh , " Oh ! " to yes the same .
I think , and I think , it should teach it .
" Ole ! " to yourself , even for having a human and testing clawyers and testing tale of your own own .
Thank you .
Thank you .
June Cohen : Ole !
As you know , I 've talked about some of these projects on the human genome , what can mean and the discovery of new new dyges .
Now we 're starting a new path . We started to digitize biology and now starting from that digital code are going to a new phase of biology , design and I mean ,
We always tried to ask to big questions .
" What 's life ? " It 's something that many biological , I think have tried to understand vary .
We tried different processes , reduced it to the minimum terms .
We 're digitizing from almost 20 years ,
When we sequenced the human genome was to go from the analog of the world of the biology of the digital world .
Now , we can regenerate life , or create new life from this digital universe ?
This is the map of a small organism , Mycoplasma genitalium , which is the smallest genome from the smallest genome of the smallest genome of the lab .
And we tried to reduce the genome to create one more smaller .
We can eliminate a hundred genes of about 500 that are here .
But when we look at the map of the metabolic map , it 's relatively simple respect to our .
I believe me , this is simple .
But when we look at all the genes that we can eliminate , one one at the time , it 's very unlikely that this can bring a living cells .
So we decided that the only way to make a synthesize this chromosome to be synthesizing this chromosome of these fundamental questions .
And so we started the adventure of " we can synthesize a chromosome ? "
Can you have chemistry to take these big molecules that we never have been able to create first hour ?
And , in case , we can we make a chromosome ?
A chromosome is just a piece of inhert material .
The speed that we 're able to digitize life is growing to exponential .
Our ability to write the genetic code , instead , proproproprophy , but it 's improving .
And our most recent results that we take to a exponential curve .
We started over 15 years ago .
The process has been asked a lot of passages , starting with a bioetic required first we started the first experiments .
But we 've discovered that synthesize DNA is very hard .
There are tens of thousands of machines in the world that are producing little segments of DNA , the long 50 letters and it 's a degenerative process : the segment is longer , the mistakes are .
So we had to develop a new method to assembly these fragments and correct the mistakes .
And this was our first attempt , to go from the digital genome of Phi genome of the Tome of the 1974 .
It 's a little virus that kills bacteria .
We designed the fragments , actually , actually , the rules the right ? and get a DNA molecule molecule of about 5,000 letter .
The interesting part is when we took this piece of inhert material , and we put it in the bacteria , the bacteria have started to read this genetic code and to viral particles .
The viral particles have been released by cells , they went back and return the Excles .
I talked about recent with membres of the oil industry by saying they 're certainly compresed this .
They have more than you .
We believe that this is a situation where software really can build its own hardware in a biological system .
But we wanted to do the bigger things .
We wanted to build the whole chromosome of the bacteria .
They 're over 580 thousand letters of genetic code .
So we thought we 're going to build it in the casss of the virus , so we can change the cassses to understand what the components of a living cells .
Designing is crucial , and if we start with digital information in a computer , these have to be very accurate .
When we sequenced this genome for the first time in 1995 accuracy was a mistake for every 10 miles .
We found , 30 mistakes . If we had 30 mistakes . If we had that original sequence never would be able to do it work .
One part of the process is to design a 50 segments that are sub-dreams with all the other 50 letters to 50 letters to build subunits to build subunits to build subunits to build subunits to build subunits .
We 're an unique elements here .
You probably have read that we 're going to read that we put the bed of the bull-grain .
So , think , we have a genetic code based on four letters : A , C , G and T.
Three of those letters put together with about 20 adds , and there 's a specific order of readers , and there 's a specific order of reading for every lominacid .
So we can use the genetic code to write words , frases , thoughts .
What we did at the beginning was autographed to do this .
Some of them have been delusers that it didn 't be poetry .
We designed these segments to just join them with enzyes .
There are zerymes that repair them and put them on them .
And we started assembly assembly , starting with segments from five to seven miles , units reading , units to a segments of 24 thousands of letter units at 24 thousand letter .
So , every step we made these segments in abundance , so we can sequence them that we 're trying to create an extremely robling processing -- as you 'll see in a minute .
We 're trying to automatize the process .
So , this seems like the tabellon a basket play-off .
When we get to these very long segments , over 100 miles , lowly 100 miles , they will not grow directly in the E.
You get to the limit to the limit of modern biology .
So we looked at other mechanisms .
We knew about another mechanism called the homologa , which is uliz-uliz-up , which is uliwarning DNA to join the DNA to join to join .
Here 's an example .
This organism , called Deinococcus radiodurans , can absorbs three million radiation ray .
You can see in the upper superior as his chromosome , it 's destroyed .
In 12 -- 24 hours , it 's really really released as it was before .
There are thousands of organisms that they can do it .
These organisms can sit completely .
They can live under empty .
They 're absolutely sure life there is in space , and you know , you know , to find new rich water environments .
ASA showed it that NASA showed this that this is .
This is a picture of the molecule that we built using these processes , simply by using the labor design of the segment to insert .
Your yeast assemble them automatically .
This picture is not taken with a microscope with a microscope , but with a regular microscope .
It 's a big molecule that we can see it with a lap microscope .
These are photos that cover a period of about six seconds .
This is the advertising that we 've done a little time ago .
They 're over 580,000 letters of genetic code .
It 's the biggest molecule of a defined structure .
It 's got a high-molecular weight .
If we stamed it with a 10 without spaces , we would like 142 pages , it would like 142 pages to just to transcer this genetic code .
Now , how do we do we do it work ? How can we activate it ?
Of course , you 're going to take a virus is a game from kids .
It 's a little bit more complicated when they use bacteria .
It 's simpler , even when it 's about eucariariods like our : you can just extract the nucleus and put up one more , which is basically the process of cloning process .
In the bacteria , the chromosome is instead integrated in the cell , but we 've been recently demonstrated that we 're able to do a bunch of a cell from another and activity .
We clean a chromosome from a microbial cycle .
The two are different as men from the mouse .
We 've got a few genes more , so we can decide what to choose for this chromosome .
And then , I 'm going to kill all the proteins .
And when we put it in the cell was wonderful -- and you 're going to appreciate our sophisticatoo-- the new chromosome -- the new chromosome .
And we started thinking that we couldn 't go beyond , but we tried to push it out there .
This is one of the greater mechanisms of evolution .
We found that a lot of species have added species to a second , or a third chromosome , and I adding in a second thousand tracts to that species .
So who think about evolution as only gene , as only a gene at the time that has not understood a lot of biology .
They have some enzyme called " enzyme restration that even to digit .
The chromosome was in the cell not one .
The cell phone chromosome that we put in the ster-up .
It 's expressed , and he recognized the other as extrange , and he masticated it , and we found it with only the cell and the new chromosome .
It 's become blue because of the genes we put in .
And in a short leverage of time , all the features of a species are gone . And we 've been lost , and we turned around into a new species , based on the new software that we put in the cells .
All the protects have changed , the membrane changed , and when we read the genetic code is exactly what we 've transferred to the genetic code is exactly what we 've transferred to .
Now , this may seem to look at the genetic , but altering the software , we can change things things in a substantial way .
Now , I 've already explained that you don 't talk about genesployed by three million years of evolution , and I said that maybe we 're going to create a new version of Cambrian explosion in which will be created new species of the digital explosion of Cambriana in which will be created new species on this digital process .
Why do that ?
I think it 's obvious when we think about our needs .
We 're going to move from six and a half billion people in the next 40 years .
Just give you an example : I 'm born in 1946 .
Now there are three people on the planet for each one existing in 1946 years , there will be four .
We 're having problems now to find a fresh water , fresh water and blind for six billion and a half billion people .
It 's going to be even more hard to do it for nine billion .
We use more five billion carbon than 30 billion carbon , more than 30 billion barium than 30 billion barium .
It means a hundred million barrel a day .
When we try to find these biological processes , or any kind of process to replace , it 's going to be a huge challenge .
We have to have the whole CO2 emission of all of the CO2 from these materials that end up in the atmosphere .
And today , thank you to scientific discoveries around the world , we have a database with about 20 million genes , and I like to think that are the design components for the future .
The electronic industry , only has a dozen about components , and think about how many different things came out .
Our limitations are principles of the biological reality and our imagination .
Now we have a techniques , thank you very quickly synthesization , to create what we call combinatory genomics .
We can build a big robot that can produce a million chromosomes a day .
Think of processing these 20 million genes or to try to optimize the processes to produce eight or drugs , new vaccines , we can change , thank you very small team , and create more biology today than in the last 20 years of science .
And it 's just a standard selection .
We can choose for a chance of survival , chemical production or carbon , will-vaccines , etc production .
This is a instantaneful of some software programmed that we 're working to be able to sit for the computer and design species to computers .
Well , we don 't know how they 're going to be .
We know exactly how their genetic code .
Now we 're focused on the fourth generation of the quarter generation .
You 've seen that you can extract thanol thanol to the gran experiment .
We have covers of second and third generation that will be used to be soon from the higher carbons than the eightt-carbon , or different kinds of butants .
But the only way that biology can have a great impact without increasing the cost of the food and limitating the cost of food and limitating the cost of food and limitating the ability to transform CO2 in matter , for which we 're working to design cells that can achieve this purposes , and we think we can have the first carbs of the quarter generation in about 18 months .
The solar light with CO2 is a metodo-- but in our discoveries around the world , we 've found different metods .
This is a organism that we 've described in 1996 .
It lives in the deep ocean , about 2,500 feet deep at the sea temperature of ebulsion of water .
They create a meter from CO2 , it 's a molecular hydrogen energy source .
We 're trying to figure out if we can uncanalate CO2 , which can easily be transported through , to get that CO2 in carbon , to drive this process .
So , a little bit of thinking we might be able to increase what the basic question is what life is " We , " What 's life " is " We , verse , " -- we have the goal of replace the whole oil industry .
Exactly . If you can 't do that from TED , where can you ?
It would become a main energy source .
Also , we 're working for using the same metods to create instantaneous instantaneous vaccines .
You 've seen this year with the flu , we 're always back to a year and with a dollar when it comes to find the vaccine .
I think that this can change by building vaccines in antiicify vaccines .
Here 's how the future could start to look at , now , the evolution tree , accelerating evolution with synthetic bacteria , arches , and inally an eucarious bacteria .
We 're at the improving people .
Our purpose is to do it in a way of living enough to try to do it . Thank you very much .
First of all , I 'll show you , the fastest possible , some fundamental , the new technology that we took the Microsoft in a purchaser than a year ago . This is Seadron .
It 's a local environment that you can interact with a huge amount of visual data that you can remote a huge amount of visual data .
Here we 're seeing a lot of the kind of digital photos with a kind of a stopping , and for a panoramic leavor , for a panoramic fast , and we avily see images as we want .
And it doesn 't matter how much much much of the information we see , how big these data are these data collections or images .
Most are common photographs , but this is a scan from the Library scan from the Library of Congress , and it comes into the range of 300 megapixel .
It does not make a difference because the only thing that has a very fairly , the prestations of a system like this is the number of your pixel on your screen in any time . It 's also a very flexible architecture .
This is a whole book , example of data not images .
This is the Casa desolate Dickens . Each colonna represents a chapter .
To show you that it 's just a little bit of a and not images , we can do something like that , to actually see that it 's a real representation of the texture of the text , not a picture .
It could be a little bit artificial to read an electronic book .
Not you know .
This is a more realistic example . It 's a number of the Guardian .
Every picture is the beginning of a section .
And it really gives you the pleasure experience to read the real version of a magazine or a newspaper or a newspaper , which is for a molteplant .
We also did something with the corner of this number particular number of The Guardian .
We created a higher advertising advertising advertising , which you use in a normal advertising -- and we put an extra content .
If you want to see the features of this automobile , you can see this here .
Or other models , or even the specific technical .
And this really shows some of these ideas to eliminate the limits of space on the screen .
We hope that this means to put up the pop-up and other porcheries like that , you don 't have to be necessary .
Of course , the map is one of the most obvious applications for this kind of technology .
And I don 't want to lose time , if we don 't want to lose that we have contribute to you even in this field .
These are all the streets in the U.S. , I 'm going to be a geospace .
So we 're going to go to something else .
This is actually actually the live on the Web ; you can go to see it .
It 's a project called Photosynth , which combine two different technologies .
One is Seadragon and the other is a very interesting visual research in Noah Snavely , a student of the University of Washington , with Steve Seitz in the UW Seitz for the UW Rick Szeliski , Microsoft Rick Szeliski Rick Szeliski Rick .
And it 's from the Web , I managed by Seadron .
You can see it when we do this kind of screen , where we can go from one image to one of the other and have this kind of experience to the other one of this image .
But the space location of images here actually has a meaning .
The layers of computers visualization have recorded these pictures together , so that they have all been connected to real places in which you imagine them -- all over the Rockpilagne . The downtoss on the Rockets -- you 're taken . So , you see of one slides of a de-stable , and these things are all of the space .
I don 't know if I have time to show you some other environment .
There are a lot more space .
I want to go directly to one of the Noah-- and this is from a previous prototype of Photosynth-prototyping Photosynthy that we 've done for the first summer , to show you what I think is really the key behind this technology , Photosynth . And it 's not necessarily obviously , looking at the environments we 've put in the website .
We had to worry about legal aspects and so on .
This is a re-building of Notre Dame images in Notre Dame images in Flickr . Basta digites Notre Dame in Flickr and you get images of types , and you get a kind of a picture that has discovered to this model .
So they 're all linked images from Flickr and they 're connected to this way .
And it 's possible to navigate this very very very simple way .
You know , I would never thought of going to end work for Microsoft .
It 's very gratificant to get this kind of accovers here .
I think you can see that it 's a lot of different kinds of photocameras : from the cell phones to those professional , SLR , a significant number of one , put together in this environment .
And if I can , I try to look for those strange .
Many of them are faces , etc .
Somewhere there is a series of photographs -- here 's a series of photographs -- here .
This is a Notre Notre Dame poster Dame recorded .
We can go from poster to the physics of this environment .
The essential point is that we can do things with social environment . This is now taking data from sudden data all over memory of the collective , from the whole memory of how it looks like the Earth 's point of view -- and connected all of that data together .
All those pictures become connected together , the major of the sum of the parts .
You have a internal of the land that emerging .
Think of this as a prolungement of Stephen Lawler 's work on Earth .
It 's something that grows in complexity as well as people use it , and the advantages for the people to use it .
Their pictures are husbed with inseries by other people .
If someone comes the idea of contradicing all of these sorts of people saying the name , my picture of Notre Dame , suddenly , I can use it as a required one of the data , and I can use it as a point of the intuition for immermerms in that metaph-the-mode experience , and have a screpectable to sit out of the red mode and cross-out of the cross-mod-out of the screen .
Of course , a consequence of all this is really highly elaborate in all the interesting part of the Earth , and it 's not just seen achieved airplane and similar images and similar images and similar images and similar images and similar images and similar images , but from the collective memory .
Thank you .
Chris Anderson : I understand ? What your software is going to take us to do is that , at a certain point , in the next few years , all of the photographs , all of the world will be practically connected together ?
BAA : Yeah . What 's doing is basically discovering .
It 's creating hyperlink , if you want , between images .
And it 's doing it in the content of images .
The thing becomes very interesting if you think about the semantles of semantes that many of these images .
As you 're doing a research of the Web , you 're digit , you know , a phrase to the web page has a lot of information about pictures .
Now , what happens if that picture you connect all your photos ?
So the amount of semantics and semantics and the amount of wealth that comes up is really enormous . It 's a classical classical effect .
CA : Blaise , it 's really amazing . Compasy .
BAA : Thank you very much .
One of the main pleasure when you travel and one of the Ethnographics is that we can live in the people who have not forgotten the antic traditions , between the wind , you have a wind , you have a touch from the wind , you 're going to have a lead to lead and the grid of the plants .
Jaguar thinking that the sciamani Jaguar traveling again , but the Milky Way Mild Via , or the mites are still still still , collight-budye , the buddists still infollow the breath of Dharma , to remember the central importance of anthropology , and the idea that the world that we live in no way , but it 's just a model of reality , but it 's just a model of reality , but it 's just a model of reality ,
the consequence of a particular adaptative choices that our sterpes have done , well or bad , many generations ago .
And , of course , we all share the essential traits .
Everybody is birth . We all profound .
We 're subjects to start .
We have to death the inexorability of death , so we don 't surprise if we 're and wheeling --
We all have an art .
What it 's the particular pitch of the song , the rhythm of every culture .
It doesn 't matter that are the Penan forests of the Borneo , or the follow Vodoo 's Vodoo , or the glower Kenya , or the desert Curandroots , the Curandroots , the Curandrooter Curandroots .
He was my journey of journey in the desert a month ago , or a yak in the yak of the IT values , the Everest , the world 's mother .
All of these people teaching us that there are other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , other ways of moving around the world .
And if you think , you think , it 's a concept that it can give you hope .
And together , the world 's myries , the world 's 's a ragnoon of life and cultural , which is important for the well-being , and it 's important for the well-being as a nice of the planet as a biox-born life .
And you can think of this re-cultural as an etnosphere and you can call the thnosphere and the total sum sum of all the conception of the whole concepts , dreams , intuitions , intuitions , intuitions , intuitions , to be intuitions ,
The thrown is the fantastic patrial of humanity .
It 's the symbol of what we 're and what we can be as inquisitive .
And because of the biosphere was really , as well consumed as it happened to the etnosphere and very faster .
Nobody 's biological , for example , 50 percent of all species is the kind of the orders are on the orders of the end of the imagination , or the most appocalypotans -- and you can 't even even be near the most optimistic issues to the most optimistic issue of cultural diversity .
The index of that is , obviously , the language loss .
When you 're born 6,000 languages on this planet .
A language is not just a vocabulated , or a series of rules or a series of rules .
A language is the sprayum of human spirit .
It 's the half of which the animal of every culture comes in the material world .
Every language is a forest of the mind , a backin , a thought , a spiritual possibility , a spiritual possibility .
And of those 6,000 languages , while we 're here sitting in Monterey , at least half it 's not supply suit in the children .
They 're no longer taught to children , which means , unless you texture something , which is already death .
What 's the sad of being , in the last to talk about the language , the last to talk a language , the last to talk a language , the not having a way to transmit the wisdom of the wisdom of the kids ?
This is a facing faced of someone in the world every two weeks , every two weeks a manufacturing a silly muor and door with it in the tombottom of the sillables of a language .
And I know someone you will tell you , " Don 't it much better ?
The world would not be a better place if we talk to all the yorugal , so we talk to the yoruba . We talk the Can all the yoruba .
We talk about kogi .
You 're going to be a sudden , what it means not to be able to talk about their own language .
And I 'd like to do a journey through the thnosphere --
a little travel to give you a mundying of what we 're losing .
Many of us forget that when I say , " different ways of exists , " I mean , " I mean , " I mean , " I mean , " It 's a different ways of there .
We take for this example , Barasana Barasana , in Amazon , the anacond people , the anapioneer of the east of the east of the east of the slatte slatte s-slatte s-slatte slatte s-slatte slatte slatte .
It 's a people that it 's not able to distinguish the blue color from the green because you were identified in the forest , which is depends on the population .
They have a strange language and a matrimonial rule , detect " examia " : " You have to marriage a different language .
And all that has radical past mitologic , supply , yet the particularly is that in these exese families in which they talk to six or seven languages because of marries marries , no one practical practical language .
They 're just going to hear and then they start talking about .
We take one of the most interesting tribe with which I lived , the Waorans of the North Ecuador north , an incredible popular that had the first contact in 1958 .
In 1957 , five missionary missionaries have tried a mistake .
They did down the top photographs that they thought they would have load to have a load of packevolved , forest that this people of the rainforest had never seen anything bi-dimensional size .
They collected the land photo from the ground , and they 're going to be a shape or a shape , and , not finding anything , they 've done anything , and they kill the five missionaries with the light-missionaries .
But Waorans don 't kill the foreign .
They kill between them .
54 percent of the mortality was caused by themselves .
We 're eight generations to eight generations of these things of natural death and when we insisted to know , they loit it it 's dead aged , so that one of them was aged , and then killed it killed it .
The hunters were able to recognize the 40 steps and recognize the species .
In the early ' 80s , I was assigned a really interesting task when my professor of Harvard , I asked me if I wanted to go to Haiti to sweet the base of Duvalier and Tonton Macoutes , and Tonton Macoutes , and imposssssweep out of the poison that the velenjoyed for the zombies .
To give a sense to miraculate , I should have to understand Vodoo culture is not magic .
It 's quite a lot of complex , a metaphysical vision of the world .
Very interesting .
If I ask you to tell you to tell me the great religions of the world , what would you say ?
Cristianism , Islam , Buddism , Ebraism , etc .
A continent is always left out , thinking that sub-Saharan Africa doesn 't have any religious feeds . And they 're all the Vodoo not the other than the distilside of these religious concepts that 's a very profound nated aspora of slavery .
What makes it interesting about voodoo is the intense relationship between life and death .
So , you know , you have to hid the spirits .
The spirites can be invoced by the Great Acqua , they respond to the dance of the dance of the dance , and they replace to the live in a short way that for a brief active .
So , for this voodoost , you go to church white you go to the God .
We give God God . "
And from the moment you 're possseat , is the spirit that you 're driving , how bad you do that ?
So you see these incredible events : follow aces in the state of trance that you 're going to touch with infuzzy demonstration a rather strong demonstration of the power of the body when it 's catalyzed in a state of extreme excitation .
At all the people I lived the most extraordinary of the Sierra Nevada , Santa Marta , in the Santa Marta , in the Santa Marta , in the secentrional Colombia .
Did of the tyrangan ancient time they were living on caraiss-planes , which was going to be a vulcanic plane , the people would be ritirated on the massive security that you would be on charged on charge planning .
In a mundry continent , this people has never been conquisted by Spanish .
But they 're governmentally governmented by a clero , but their formation is really extraordinary .
The young people have taken away from the families to three or four years , and they live in a world that 's made of dark and shadows in the world of the ice for 18 years .
Two periods of nine years of course , choices to reproduce the nine months of the management that they spend in the users of the mother , now are metaphically in the uteral of the Great Mother .
So , all this time , they 're acculturate to the values of their society , values that they preprayers and only their prayers keep the cosmic balance -- or to say the balance balance .
At the end of this incredible initiation , they 're suddenly taken out and for the first time in their age of 18 years , they see a dawn . And in that active well-ball of the first ball of that you have learned in theory , everything they 've learned in theory . The prete valles of the landscape comes , everything they 've learned in theory . The prete a step back and says , pass a step back and says ,
" Sright ? " Five as I told you .
It 's wonderful . Now it 's going to protect it . "
They call them the greater brothers and they say that we , the minor brothers , we 're the collider of destruction of the world .
This level of intuition is extremely important .
When we think about India India 's ingene and the environment invoy of Rousseau and the old story of the noble wild , which is a razer concept in its simplicity or maybe invote Thoreau and we say that these people are closer to Earth .
Ingenes are not not as feeling or feeling .
There 's no space for these things in the malarial palual palators or the winds of Tibet , but thank you to the time and rate , they created a mystical Earth that 's not about the concept of it , but thank you very much close to but an intuition of the Earth can live because it 's infused by human consciousness .
What does that mean ?
He means that a boy of the Ande who 's growing up believing that the mountain is a wild Apu who will lead his destiny will be a destiny different , and it will have a different human being a very different way to a mountain , or a respect of the Montana is growing a mountain of rocks being able to be able to scave .
which is a dimad-one spirit or a mineral caby is irrelevant .
What 's interesting is the metaphor that 's interesting to deal with the relationship between individual and the natural world .
I grew up in the Columbia 's Columbia believing that the forests to be cut .
And that made me a human being different from my friends Kwautter who believe that the forests are the forests of Hamk and the blind 's historic , and the blind spiriters that live to the northern the world , that they deal with the world Hamatsa .
If you start to consider that these cultures could create different reality , you could start to understand some of their sensional discoveries . We take this plants .
I took this picture to open up this picture in the nordocctor in the nordocctor .
Mayathids of you have heard about the ayahuash , the most powerful psychoactive substance of the sciamanic repertory .
What makes it fascinating the ayahuash is not the pharmacological potential of the substance , but its elaboration . It 's made by two elements .
On one side , this lian lap-le-carbon , harm and harm and harmmful , harmmolines , harmful and harmmful , harmful and harmful .
Taking the only plants , you have a blusters that it 's a little bit that it 's a consciousness , but it 's measured by the leaves of a coffee family said Psychotridis called Psychotridis .
This plant has powerful powerful triptamines , very similar to the serotonin , dimethoxptamine-5 , methoxtamine .
If you ever see the Yanomami you 'll get on the nose that they do a different set of species , I 'm going to have a different methoxydimethoxyptamine .
To see that poor poor is a little bit like being disappeared by a caric fucile of painting bits and land to land a sea of electricity . And it 's not believable to reality .
I was often a lot of my professor , Richard Evan Shultes , the man who has taken the psycholthetic , with his discovering fungi with his discovered in the ' 30s in Mexico .
I think , my aren 't you can class these triptamines as hallucinogens because you 're not going to tell any one of them to be hallucinated .
It 's possible to take the orally , just if you 're assumption with other chemicals that you know , " Or the MAO .
Now , the beautiful coal : beta-coal , which is in this liants are in the MAO , the same kind of necessary to potential triptamines . The question is going to be able to potential of these people find two deales , how do these people find two deges not like that , but if you combine in this way , create biochemistry . It 's sound like this , creating biochemiic version of the superior that 's superior to the sum of the sudden .
We use the great eupherd eupherror , which can revealed infrufer .
But if you ask the Indians , they 'll tell us , " The plants are talking about it . "
What does that mean ?
This tribe , the Cofan , has 17 variety of ayahuh , which is narely narely to the forest , and that our eyes would retain in the same species .
If you ask them , how they 're stopping their tassonomics will tell us , " I thought , " I thought , " I said , " No . "
The solution is : you take 17 variety of a full l-laps in a full , and each one canve a different one .
And this is not graduated to Harvard , but it 's much more interesting to contact the stami .
Now , [ applausers ] the problem is that we have to have a heart popular people find them in their own world , and it 's not a little bit of a story about the real world , and it 's going beyond .
In fact , 300 years old , it 's not going to be reminded to its wars or or or innovations , but rather as the one was where we stopped and actively actively or accepted accepted , or accepted accepted , or accepted by passively or accepted by the planet . Now the problem is not the change .
All the cultures through the centuries have been involved in a dance for new chance of life .
And the problem is not technology .
The Indians Sioux , they don 't have to be Sioux when they put up the argue and they 're not going to be Americans when they put in the horse and calculus .
It 's not the change or technology that threatening the integrity of the etnosphere . It 's the power .
The hard hard to the domination .
And if you look at the world , you 'll find that these are not destinated cular culture .
They 're living creatures and dynamics out of the identify of identify , that they 're going to beyond their ability to adaptation .
I know that you 're debation in the Penan --
a people of Sarawak , in the Sarawak , in the Asian , a people who lived in the forest to a generation ago , and now reduced to a generation ago , and now reduction on the remarkable of the river , where you can see the rivers of the rivers that seems to take away the Borneo Meridional Meridional Meridional Cinese Meridional Meridional Cinese Meridional , where you can see the illustrate ,
It 's going to fill the stone stands with the sound of the forest .
Or , the Yanomami , are the disease that are the disease that came with the gold .
If we move on the mountains of Tibet , where I 'm doing a lot of research , you 'll see the hard laster of the political domination .
As you know , the genocide , physics of a popular , is convicted of the popular , but the ethnocide , the destruction of a popular , not only is convicted , but even celebrated in unless environments , because it 's part of the strategigiges , because it 's part of the developing strategigic development .
And you can 't understand the suffering of Tibet until you 're in the beginning .
I 've been around 6,000 miles from Chengdu in the Western China through Tibet , and I 'm coming to Lhasa with a young college , but only came to Lhasa , I realized what 's behind the statistics that we hear .
6,000 sacred sacred sacred in dust and cenables .
1.2 million people killed by the military during the Cultural Revolution .
The father of this guy was ascriticized at Panchen Lama .
which means that it was killed in the templated in the CEO of the Chinese invasion .
His sweep with Sua Santity , during the diaspora that has taken the people in Nepal .
Her mother was impried and his colpe was to be rich .
It was brought to hidden in the age of two years , he would hired under his gonna because he couldn 't live without him .
And the sister , which did the same , has been put in reduced in reducation .
One day he inavailed a day , a window , a day , he was put a willing jobs for seven years .
Tibet 's pain can be unoverbable , but the reesterday of the people is from tener present .
And then , all of the end , everything comes up to a choice .
We want to live in the monoony of the monoonia or we want to acallow the world of diversity ?
The great anthropologist Margaret Mead , before he said that his greatest fear was that , in our going to go towards this performance , not only to see the whole range of human imagination , but one day we 're going to see the whole range of a mindset of thinking , but one day we 're going to get from a sleep , forgotten to a sleep ,
And it 's umilliant to remember that our species is in 600,000 years .
The Neolitic Revolution , which has given us the agriculture , which has done us subcustomed to the seed of the seed of the skiaman with the prosse of the cler-up , creating the hierarchy of specialization , and we talk about 10,000 years ago .
The modern industrialized world has been in the 1,000-year-old industrialized world .
And that shares story not suggests that we have the answers to all the challenges that we have to deal with the millennia to come .
When you get these mirild of the world is asked what it means to be human , they respond to be humans , they respond to 10,000 different voices .
And it 's in these answers that we all all risk the chance to be what we are : a kind of a consciousness , which is to make all the people and all the gardens can fight . And there are great moments of optimism .
I took this picture on the northern extremity of Baffin the island , when I went to the whales of Inuit , and this man , Olaya , Olaya , he told me the wonderful story of his grandfather .
The cannot government was not always as a gentle-in-popular Inuit and in the ' 50s to to make our suprematic , we have to give them them coloned colonies .
The grandfather of this man refused to go .
The family , I temh for his life , bring it away all the guns , and all of his attitude .
You have to know that Inuit don 't flip the cold , they exploit .
The latters in the slatter were made of pain in the skin .
The grandfather of this man didn 't have to go from night or from the library , or from the library , who had been suffered .
It 's sgattle , it 's calculated the pads in focuses and defecated in their hand . When they got them them , they 've been doing it , they worked a lama .
It 's sprayed on the points of this habit and when it came solid , he killed a dog .
He 's taken the dog and created a brillilier , with the hacic cass created a sleep , he imbrillied another dog and he disappeared to the bucks , haking hacks in the shake , hacks the caccess in the hacric .
We want to talk about cape with nothing ? [ Recate ] . And this , in different ways , [ Applausi is the symbol of resilience of the Inuit and all of the indigenous popular world .
In the aprile 1999 , the canadvance , in the aprist government has been the total control of an area of the bigger California and put together together .
It 's their new laps . It 's called Nunavut .
It 's an independent territory . They 're going to be all the mineraries .
One of the plendigging example of how a natione-state can recognize with his people .
And , to finish , I think it 's pretty obvious at least to who of us was in these remote areas , realized that they don 't have remote at all .
For someone is home .
They represent severing seizography of human imagination that will rest to the sounds of these children , as dreams of these children , as dreams of hope .
Finally , we of National Geographic , we 're convinced that politicians will never come to anything .
We believe that the polemies --
[ Applausi is not persuasive , but we believe that stories can change the world , and maybe we 're the best institution to tell the stories of the world . Every month , our website is to be 35 million visible visit .
156 countries transmitted our television channel .
Our magazines are being a million people .
Our work is to travel in the etnosphere to bring our audience in places that are going to be able to lead to how much they have seen , and hopefully , abbracing for the central reveal , absolutely , the world of existing in the diversity , and we have to find a style of life in a pluralist and multicultural world in a pluralist and multicultural world . And we 'll find a bond a style of life in a pluralist world in the world ,
which is the wisdom of all the people can contributing to our collective well-being collective well-being .
Thank you .
I 'm going to talk about some things that I wrote in this book that I hope you 've heard of and I 'm going to try to understand some connections , in case you don 't notice them .
I would like to start with what I call the " " dogma " officer "
Do you know what ?
The officer of all the Western industrial society . The official dogma is , " If you want to massix-like well-being of our citizens . "
The reason is , from one side , in the fact that liberty is in itself , is actually a value , is uable , useful , essential for human beings .
At the other is that if we 're free , each of us can act for all of us can act for all the massive well-being , without no no one that you decide to do it .
The way to massive that the freedom is massive similar choice .
The more choices are more libed , and greater is their freedom , the more is their well-being .
This is , I think , is so deeply rooted in society that no one would be to put it in doubt .
And it 's deeply roated in our lives .
I 'm going to show you some examples of what made .
This is my supermarket . It 's not particularly big .
I lose a simple note about the conditions for save .
In my supermarket , there are 175 conditions , without content the 10 variety of oil extrad , and 12 acet-a-seamic aceters that no one of the 175 proning points is of your deal with the respective circumstance that no one of the 175 pronth ready is of your degrees .
Here 's how supermarket .
Then you go to the store of electronic to buy a stereo : you go , CD lector , radio , radio , plastic lefer .
And in this single store of electronic , there 's a great number of haudio components .
We can do six million and a half of different combinations that there are in one store .
You have to admit that there 's a lot of choice .
The world of communications : the world of communications .
Once , when I was a child , you could get all the wide telephone services , and they were fornites of mom Bell .
You had the phone , you didn 't buy it .
One consequence of that , by the next one was that the telephone never would break .
These days are gone .
Now , we 've been a nearararephones , especially between mobile bile bile phones .
Here are the cellular of the future .
My favorite is that in the middle , MP3 , cut it cut off of the nose , and shin-for-householding me .
If you don 't have yet seen it in the store under house , you 're very well going to get .
And what happens to the end is that people go to the store and this question . And you know what the answer is ? The answer is " No . "
It 's not possible to buy a cell phone that you don 't do too many things .
So , in other life that are much more important than the acquired , you know , the same plosion of choices .
Assistence : no healthcare : it doesn 't happen anymore in the United States that you 're going to be done .
Instead , you go to the doctor , and the doctor says , " OK , we could do . " Or " A has these benefits and the risk . " " " It has these benefits and risk . What you want to do ? "
You say , " Doc , what should I do I do ? "
And the doctor says , " A has these benefits and risk , and you have these benefits and you have these benefits . "
" What do you want to do ? "
And you think , " Doc if she was me , what would you do ? "
And the doctor : " But I 'm not . "
The result of the result , " the result , " expression that makes it look like this .
But , actually , it 's not that one move the weight and responsibility for you to make a decision from someone who knows something , which is the doctor , to someone else knows anything -- and almost certainly it 's sick -- and it 's not in the ideal condition to take patient 's obvious .
There 's a huge marketing of pharmaceutical products , direct people like me and you , that if you think you don 't have any sense , because you can 't buy them .
But if we can 't buy them , why do you have it ?
The answer is that they want to domorning , we call the doctor to ask them to change the recipe .
So , a fundamental thing as our identity is a question of choice , as you see in this wild , " We don 't want to to provide the children . " We don 't want to provide the children . " We don 't know about an identity : we have to invent it .
And we can reinvent how many times we do it .
which means that every morning , at the rising , you have to decide that kind of person you want to be .
It was to the family and marriage , a time perspective , a time perspective , which was that you were marriage , and it was that you were marriage , and it started to get the most soon possible .
The only real choice was with who , not when , and even what to do after .
And I 'm going to play it .
I teach them to very smart students , and I do 20 percent in less than a time .
And not because they 're not bright , not because they 're not as diligent .
but why I 'm impensierated , intent , I 'm going to married , or not ? Would I have to do that now ? "
" Would I be marriler ? " I 've got to think before or career ? "
They are interrogatives .
And they try to answer these questions , even though this implabs not complete the compete that I 'm not going to get a bel and I don 't get a bel vote to my examples .
And they really have to do this . They 're important .
Now , the job : we 're lucky , like Carl , because technology allows us to work every minute , every day , from every day , from every day , from every day , the corner of the Hotel Randolph .
So I 'm talking about , there 's a corner , and I won 't tell anybody where the WiFi works .
I don 't tell you , because I want to use it .
What does this mean , this amazing freedom of choice that we have about work ? It 's we have to continue , and we have to work on it , and not .
We can go to see our child playing hot , with the mobile phone in a cell phone , Blackberry in the other , and the notextly , on the glasses .
And even though they 're all spent , every minute we see our child finished , we 're also asking the game , we 're also asking this , " I have to respond to this called ? "
" I have to answer this email ? "
And even when the answer is " no , " all this makes the experience of your own child , very different from what it would be in other conditions .
So , from all the way we look , little things , big , big , materials and life is a question of choices .
Once the world was this : That was , there were some possibilities , but not all that was a question of choice .
The world is today looks like this : The dilemma is , " Is it a good thing , or negative ? "
The answer is Sure .
So , the positive lates that we all know , so I 'm going to talk about the negatives .
So , all this choice , two negative effects on people .
The first one , paradowically , is that it produces paralysis that it produced paralysis .
With a lot of options between which chooses , it becomes very hard to .
I give you an example of a conduct example : a conduct a conduct example : a flight on volunteer .
A colleagues had access to the Vanguard data , the gigantic society , with about a million clients of pinkers in 2,000 different companies .
What she found is that for every 10 of the 10 solutions that are offered in more , the percentage of two percent of the adhesion .
With 50 offered cords , there 's 10 percent in less than adhhesions than only five . Why ?
Because with 50 four-founds between which choosing , is , it 's sick difficult to decide , and the choice is remainly hard to decide , and they stay up to the tomorrow .
And tomorrow , and again , tomorrow , tomorrow , and of course , we 're never going to be .
You know , it doesn 't just mean that these old work from old work to dogs because they 're not going to have enough money , it also wants to say that the decision is so forgives that the decision is so forgives you the decide that allowly lose the dator of work .
Don 't , they 're losing up to five thousand dollars for a year from work dator , which would be very well-disposed to them .
So , paralysis is a consequence of having too many choices .
And I think it makes the world like this .
" And to finish , for ethernity : ketchup , senape or maion ? "
You would just take the right decision , if it 's for ethernity , isn 't it ?
You don 't want to choose the wrong bottom , and you don 't want to choose .
So this is the first effect . The second is that even though we can avoid the parallel and do a choice , we 're not going to be done with less options that we would be with less options to the result .
And this is a different reasons .
One of these is that with a lot of conditions that you choose , and you know , you know , it 's not easy to imagine that you could have done a different choice that you could have been better . And what happens is that the alternative imaginated to imagine you would be better . And what happens is that the alternative ininches of choice , and repecting the soddissleep , and reply decreased by the decision pressure ,
And even when it was a good decision .
The more choices there are more , it 's easier to be dislierts that is unsodational .
Also , there 's what economists call to be an opportunity .
Dan Gilbert clear , very well , stamattine , like the value that we 're going to depends on what we compare them .
Of course , when there are many options , it 's easy to represent the features of the alternative ars of the showing , and be less sophistic .
Here 's an example . I schools with all the ones that are not in New York .
But that 's what you probably think you would .
There 's this couple to the Hamptons .
A lussian place .
It 's all about splendied . It 's all about them .
It 's nothing . But what he thinks is , " Well , the advance , it 's Agotten . "
" Everybody 's neighbors in Manhattan are away . "
" I could talk about it right in front of home . "
And it spread two weeks assillated from the idea that 's losing -- every day -- the chance of parking where it wants .
The constantly decreases the soddisfaction for what we have , even when the choice was excellent .
And the more are the options that we 've been looking at , the more , attractive features will be going to be able to come up with the opportunity .
Here 's another example .
This is a lot of things tells us .
It 's talking about the time , and maybe a slowly .
But the most important point is that anything you want , you know , you 're not going to do .
The things that we don 't choose to be a lot of attractive , which we can make less attract what we do .
And the third point : growing the spiral of expectations .
I tried it on my skin buying a new couple of jeans .
It 's almost always jeans .
Once the jeans were just a kind of , you buy them and they were bought to the besy , only after having a life and work , and they were working a lot of times , they started going to go .
So , I went to buy a couple of new when the old people went , and I said , " I need a couple of jeans , this is my cut . "
The committer said , " Look wants slim fit , easy fit , axed ? "
Do you want to take them with the cernian or buttons ? " Stonewashed " or " acidwashed ? "
" Do you want to be layers ? "
" Have it to take them or stretch ? " Bla bla blah , " Continuated to elenaccomplishment .
I was sbalorger , and I was able to say , " I want the guy to say , " I want the guy that was the only guy , " He had no idea what it was , so for a hour , I tried to all of the jeans , and I went out from the store , I 'm going to do with the best couple of jeans that ever had .
It was the most most of that I had the best .
But I felt worse .
Why ? I wrote a whole book to understand it .
The reason I was worse is that with all that choice is that with all that choice were very high , jeans had to be perfect .
I was at a minmespan . I didn 't expect to anything except that when there was one of that , but when there was 100 different , accidents , at least one had to be perfect .
What I had buy was good , but not perfect .
After that I had a choice to what I was trying to do was unsatisfied in comparison to expectations .
The addition of options in life is not doing that that they have respect to the expectations that these excellence of the options .
And this will be less sound , even when the results are good .
Nobody in the marketing , he realized it .
Because if they knew it , you 're not awful about what I 'm talking about .
It looks more truth to look more like this .
" It was better when it was worse . " The reason that was better when he was worst when he was worst , when he was worst of pleasure .
Over the world , we live in -- opulent , industrialized citizens with the expectation of performing -- the most of the things that we can hope is that things are things to the altitude .
You never surprised that because your expectations , my expectations , my expectations , they 're ingigantic .
The secret of happiness -- what you 're here -- it 's , " Baxis is you 're going to . "
I mean , little whose wheel-whose -- I really married and my wife is really wonderful .
I couldn 't do it , I couldn 't do it , I didn 't get account .
But it 's not always a bad thing .
And finally , a consequence of buying a couple of jeans discovers when there is that you 're not satisfacts , and you know , " Why ? "
" Who is responsible ? "
The world is responsible . What could you do that ?
When there are hundreds of kinds of jeans , and you buy a insoft , and you ask who is the responsible , is the clear , it 's the clear that responsible you .
You could have done better .
And with hundreds of variety of variety , not there are no excuses for insuccess .
So when people take decisions , even if the result is valid , you feel like that , and they 're insatives , they feel like they 're all satives .
In the last few years , depression is exploded in industrialized world .
I think that a significant factor -- not the only one , but important -- of this depression is that people have a deludents is that people have a delusion for deluseful facturing factor because standard are too high .
And when they have to explain this situation , they think that colpe is them .
So the final result is that we 're better , objectively , but we feel worse .
Let me remember .
This is the official dogma , what we all take for good and it 's completely fake . It 's not true .
There 's no doubt that a little bit of choice is better than you have no deal with it , but it doesn 't happen , but it 's not a lot of choice is better than a bit .
There 's a critical value , magic . I don 't know what it is .
But I 'm sure we 've been overcome from a piece , the level in which choices make our life .
Now , from the political point of view -- I almost finished -- from the political point of view , the pel is the followest .
What allows this all this choice in industrial society is the material wealth .
There are a lot of places in the world , and you know , where the problem is not that they have a choice .
The problem is that they have too poca .
So the factory that I 'm talking about is a malbeing extraordinary of modern , Western society .
And what it makes you depress and angry is this : Steve Levitt Levitt told you about how those and seats for baby . It 's a sprec of money .
I mean that these choices , complicated and available , is not that they 're not just unuseful .
I 'm absolutely deleteries .
They 're worse .
If a bit of what our society in our society , it allows it to be reversed in those where people have too few possibilities , it would not only be their life to improve but our own life .
This is what economists call it a paretian improvement .
A redistribution of income re-distribution reyes , not only to the poor -- because of this choice of choice in excess that it is going to be .
So , to conclude , " You can become all the way you want " --
You , people of culture , you think , " What does that fish ? "
" It 's obvious that you can 't do anything in a glass box . "
" A castrated , a limited view of the world --
and I interpret this so , at the beginning .
But then , thinking , instead , I realized that , I realized that that fish is the long .
Because the reality of the facts is that if you send in the bottom , so that you can 't get the freedom . You get the paralysis .
If you break the bottom in a way that all of diving to be able to decrease .
You know , you 're going to reduce the wells .
Everybody needs a sphere .
This is almost certainly too closely , maybe even for the fish , and certainly for us .
But the absence of a few symbolic symbolic symbol is a recipe for infeless .
Thank you very much .
