Last year , I showed this slides to demonstrate that the artical calculus , that for almost three million years had the size of 48 million years had the size of the 48 United States , it turns out to 40 percent .
However , this subvalue the gravity of the problem , because it doesn 't show the spent of the ice .
The Arctic ice is , in a certain sense , the clear heart of the global climate system .
It expands up the winter , and you retreat it .
The next slide is going to be a quick , in the last 25 years .
Places have been signed in red .
As you can see , they expand to the blue .
That 's the ice in the winter , which is retreatment .
You can see that so-called the sheet ice , of five years or more , is like blood , which is like blood , which is like blood .
And in 25 years , so , right .
This is a problem because heating the whole thing that is interested in the ground , where there are enormous amount of carbon where there are enormous amounts of coaling carbs .
It turns out to the totality of the global warming , that amount of global warming could double , overcome this point of not back .
In a little profound lage in Alaska , the methane is already rebedded by the water .
The professor Katey Walter of Alaska University of Alaska took a team in the winter .
Video : Wow ! Al Gore : You 're going to be good . The question is if we 're going to be .
A reason is that this thermal exchange changer Groenland from the North .
This is a glacial regime .
The brought had never achieved levels .
This is the Kangerlussuaq , in the south of the Groenland .
If you want to know what the sea level to the sea level of the sea on terraferences , here is where the sea .
These running current .
Another part of the planet : Antarctica , the biggest block of the planet .
The last month , scientists have deployed that the ice of the ice is in the negative , and that the Western Antarctica , which is particularly rapidly quickly in the leaving leaves .
Eval at six feet of the sea level level , like in Groenland .
Sulla Himalaya , the third bigger block of ice , you see new laghi , which few years ago were glaciers .
40 percent of the world 's population half of the world 's population .
Sulle Ande : this glacier is the source of this city .
It 's increased it .
But when it decreases , the same is going to be able .
In California , the snow in the Sierra Nada is decreased 40 percent .
idrics are in crisis .
The predictions , as you 've read .
The growth of the world leads to a remarkable increase .
The environmental disaster environmental disaster .
Four times more numbers over the last 30 years than the previous 75 .
This is a very unsustainable way .
If you look at it in the context , you can see the consequences .
In the last five years , we 've added 70 million tons of CO2 every 24 hours -- 25 million tons of tons in the ocean every day .
Look at the East Pacific area , from the Americas , to the west , and to both the parts of the Indian subcontinent , where there 's a radical oxygen in the oceans .
The greater cause of global warming , together with deforestation , which is 20 percent of them is the fossisil fuels .
The oil is a problem , and carbon is even worse .
The United States is one of the two more emissions , together to China .
And he was proposed to build a lot of other central carbon .
But we 're seeing a lot of direction .
These are the anullated projects over the last few years , and some green alternative alternative projects .
Anyway , there 's a political fight in our country .
The carbon industries and carbon industries have spent 250 million dollars in the last year to promote carbon , which is a oxymal .
And that picture would remember me something --
So , Christmas in Tennessee , where I live , there was a loss of 3.8 billion lifetime .
You can see it on the news .
This is the second bigger flow in America .
It happened around the Christmas .
The publicity of one of the carbon industry was this .
Video : I said , " Drosty the carbon is an allegro and happy .
It 's abundant here in America , and it 's growing our economy .
Frosty carbon is increasing .
It 's a good price , and workers keep it .
Al Gore : From here is most of the West Virginia .
The biggest minerary society on the mountains is Massey Coal . This is his administrator .
Video : Don Blankenship : I 'll be clear -- Al Gore , Nancy Pelous , Nancy Pelous , Harry Reid -- they don 't know what they 're talking about .
Al Gore : So the Alleance for Protection of Clima has launched two campaign .
This is one of them , one part .
Video : Acore : Alla COALergy : OALergy , as a threat to our business .
So , our priority is to invest a huge amount of money in an advertising to make public and confused the truth .
Actually , carbon is not spending .
We think it 's clean -- it also has a good prosm .
So not pushing climate change .
Let me do this .
Video : Carbone : Carbone -- you 've heard a lot of it .
So we 're going to make a turn into a horrian structure to the dry about the clean coal .
Straordinary ! The cars are a little noissue , but this is the sound of the puly-carbon technology technology .
The carbon consumption consumption consumption is the main of global warming , but the remarkable of carbon technology that you see changes everything .
You look at this : this is the hot coal technology .
Al Gore : Finally , the positive is connects to the economic issues and the national security .
Video : The America is in crisis ; the economy , national security , climate crisis .
The bottom that connects all : our dependence from fossil fuel , like fossil coal and oil imported .
Now , but , there 's a new , audace solution to go out .
AS : 100 percent of clean energy , in 10 years .
A plan to put America to work , to make it more safe , and helping to stop global warming .
Finally , a solution that is brought to our problems .
Put . Scovers more .
Al Gore : This is the last .
Video : It 's about resolution , it 's about America .
One of the faster of the fastest ways to dependence from the combustible that they kill our planet .
Compar : The future is here . Sun , a new energy network .
Compars for two : Novi investments for very well retribes .
Comment : Repower . It 's time to be realists .
Al Gore : A old proverbio African proverbio says , " If you want to go fast , go to yourself .
If you want to go . "
We have to go away , quickly .
Thank you very much .
Last year at TED , I introduced a TED LHC .
And I promises to go back to how the machine works .
So here I am there . And for the one of the other time , there were no , the LHHC is the greatest scientific experiment never attached -- 27 miles of circuit .
Her task is to reconstruction the conditions that were present less than one billion in the universe -- to 600 million times a second .
This is simply ambitious .
This is the Ginevra .
We photographed these min-Big Bang in the detectors .
This is what I work on . It 's called ATLs -- it 's about 44 feet and has a 22 diameter diameter diameter .
This is a spectacular picture of AS in building , so you can see proportions .
On the 10th , last year , we accesurate the machine for the first time .
And this picture was taken by ATLS .
It was because of immense festegation in control .
It 's an image of particles that had done all around the LHHC , entering in collision , in collision , deliberately , with a part of the LHHC , and spread particles into the detector .
In other words , when we looked at that picture , the 10 september , we realized that machine was a great wictory .
I don 't know if this was going to get more or this one , when somebody went to Google and saw that the initial page was this .
That means we 've had a cultural impact beyond to that scientific impact .
About a week later , there was a problem with the machine , because of these sleep sleep .
These kids take 13,000 points when the machine works at the most power of the power of the power of the power of the power of it .
Now , the technical technicians of you will look at the files and say , " It 's not true . They are too subtle . "
And they can do it , because when they 're very cosideways they 're going to get the super-convictims .
So at least 271 degrees , at least 271 degrees , at least 271 degrees in the space between stars , these flows can bring the current .
In one of the juncore magnets in the LHHC , there was a defect of the factory .
So , the files , and the 13,000 amps suddenly meaning , and the 13,000 herself had an electric resistance .
This was the result .
Now , this is even more impressive if you think that these magneti fish more than 20 tons , and that you 've been moving about 30 initions .
They were damaged about 50 magnets .
We had to take them , what we did .
We 've restinated them .
Now , they 're going back to all their place underground .
By the end of the LHHC is is going to be a whole new integral .
We 're going to access it , and we expect to get the data or June , and we 're going to continue so our adventure to find out what are the morning that the universe .
Now , of course , in a certain way , these accidents reacting debate the debate on the value of science and the engineering in front . It 's easy to convenient .
I think the fact that it 's so hard to go beyond the boundaries , I think this is the value of things like LHHC .
I would like to end with the words of one English scientist , Humphrey Davy , which , imagine , in defense of inuseful experiments of his pupille , his pupille was , and he said , " Nothing is so dangerous for progress of the human mind , how much dangerous that we don 't have a measurements , that we 're not mysterpieces in nature . "
Thank you .
I want to start asking you to start thinking about when you 're children , played with the moroncles .
As you know how to get them and get them , and take them , and take them , and learn them , you know , actually , you know , and you know , you know , in fact , you know , and you can manipulate it relationship .
The space reasoning is deeply connected to the way we understand most of the world around us .
So , to inspirate from the utility of our interaction with physical objects , together to my consultant , and my collaborator Jeevan Kalanithi , I started to ask , " And if , when we use a computer , instead of having the only cursor of the multi-digital cursor that moves on a desk, we could deal with an information to both hands ,
Is that pleasure it ?
The question was so interesting that we decided to explore the response , building Siftable .
In a few words , a Siftable computer is a great interactive computer .
In a few words , a Siftable computer is a great interactive computer .
You can move them with their hand , you can see " between them , to feel their movement , and they have a screen and a wireless screen .
But most importantly , they 're physical objects , like the morning , you can simply move through it .
Siftable is an example of a new ecosystem tools to manipulate digital information .
And as they become more physicists , awful , of the movement , of others , and as they become more physicists , and as they become more physical , of the movement , of how the movement of interaction .
I 'll start with some simple example .
This Siftable is configured to show the video : if you 're going to stop it in a direction , the video is going to go to the other side .
These interactive portraits .
If you face them , they 're interested in what they 're around .
If they 're surrounded , and they can act a little bit .
If they 're surrounded , and they can act a little bit .
They also have their movement and inclination .
We then realized that one of the interesting implications of the interaction was to be able to use communal gestures on data , for instance , as if it was a liquid .
In this case , we 've got three Siftconfigurate as a bucks of vernice and I can use them to deal color in that central , where they mix .
and I can use them to deal with the color in that central , where they mix .
We 're too much , we can put a bit a place .
Now , there are beautiful possibilities of learning , like language , the mathematics , where the logic games where people can prove things very quickly .
I 'm now --
This is a Fibonaccount that I do with an equations program .
Here 's a game of words that 's at half between Scarabeo and Boggle .
Pratically , at all , at all , you 're going to get a letter to every Siftable , Pratically , to every Turn a letter to a letter , and while you 're trying to compete with him , and when you 're trying to compare him on a dictionary .
And then , after about 30 seconds , and you have a new letter set of reading and new possibilities to try .
Thank you .
Here 's the children came to the Media Lab , I made it so I tried them , and I made a video .
They are very plexed .
And one of the interesting things of this kind of application is that you don 't have to give people a lot of education .
You just say , " Compons of words , and they know exactly what to do .
Here 's the other people who try it .
This is our youngsters there on the right .
In fact , he wanted to stop them .
They were only bringing morning , for him .
Now , this is an application of an interactive cardboard .
And we wanted to build a tool for the learning of language . He 's Felix .
It can insert new characters in the scene , by liftable .
It can insert new characters in the scene , by liftable .
So , he 's going to get out the sun .
Video : The sun is smile .
David Merrill : Now it took a tretor in the scene .
Video : The arange .
Bel work ! Yes ! Yeah !
So by the Siftable Siftable and puts them close to the characters --
Video : Bau !
-- by inventing their story .
Video : Hi !
DM : It 's a story with the open open , and it can decide him as you do .
DM : It 's a story with the open open , and it can decide him as you do .
Video : From it away .
DM : The last example I have the time to show you is a instrument , made of recent , to sampling and executive music .
it 's an instrument , which is a recently recently , to sampioning music .
Siftable here from sound as a base , low-bottom and bacteria .
Each one of these has four different variations , and you can choose which to use .
And you can also put these sound in a sequence to get to your pleasure .
And to modify it just to touch a sound and a sequence .
These are effectively you can control from the alive , like reverbero and filter .
It attacks to a particular sound and then fixes to fix it .
And then there are the general effects as time and volume , that they apply to the entire sequence .
Let 's look at how it works .
Video : We 're going to build a base in two Siftable sequence , we 're going to build it in a series , and we put it in a series , we add the other base .
Now I 'll put a bottom line .
Video : Now , let 's add percussion --
Video : And I 'm going to put the filter to the bacteria , so I can control the live effect .
Video : DM : I can quickly quickly the entire sequence , by one side .
Video : And I 'm going to add the bottom , to add the lower expression .
Video : DM : I can recombine the sequence .
So I don 't have to plan it before , but I can improvise , making it longer or .
And now , finally , I can spend the whole sequence on the left , the Siftable .
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is to build new mo-to-machine interfaces how our brain work and body work .
And today , I had time to show you one of the results of this path , and also some possibilities that we 're trying to bring out of the lab .
The concept that I want to transmit is that it 's coming to this new generation of design objects to interact with digital media , that will bring information into our world that we want .
Thank you very much .
I don 't see the time to talk to all of you .
I 'm a writer .
It 's my profession , but it 's my profession , of course .
It 's also love and love my life .
And I don 't expect that it can change .
But , I said that , something particularly happened in my life , and in my career , which has brought me to get the entire relationship to this work .
The particular thing is that I 've recently written this book , this biography called Mangia , Ama , Ama , Ama , " which , differently from my precedented books , for some reason out in the world and became a big , feeling , international brought .
And the result is that wherever you go now , people treat me as if you were convicted .
Really -- convicted , convicted .
And they 're all worried to me and they say , " Don 't you fear that we can 't do that anymore ?
You don 't you fear to continue to write the whole life without being able to create a book that can be important to someone ? "
that can be important to someone ? "
It 's certainly , you know .
But it could go worse , and I remember that over 20 years ago , when I began to tell people -- I was an adolescent -- I wanted to be a writer .
I was going to meet the same reaction that it was based on the fear .
And people told me , " Don 't I could not be able to success ? "
Do you don 't you fear that humiliation , killed you ?
Do you don 't you fear to do this .
So , you know .
And the answer to all of these questions is , " Yes . "
Yes , I 'm afraid of all those things .
I always had fear .
And I also fear to a lot of other things that people cannot gue .
Like the algae and other things .
But , for how much to write what I thought , and I would wonder is why ?
Is it rational ?
It 's logical that anyone should expect to be frightened by a job that you know .
But what 's really about this particular companies that makes us nervous healthy about the mental health , in one way that other carriers don 't do ?
How my father , for example , he was a chemist engineer , and I don 't remember one in his 40 years of activity in which he was asked if he had fear to be an engineer ?
There was never -- that block of engineer John , what does it happen ?
He didn 't work like that , you know ?
Onestly , chemical engineers as a group aren 't certainly , in the centuries , earned the reputation of the depressives .
We writers , we have enough this reputation , and not only writers , but creativity of all kinds , we have this reputation to be enormously instable .
And you 're not going to look at the sad context of the deaths of creative magniques that , only in the 20th century , they die young and often .
And the ones that you 're not suicidated by their dunes .
Norman Mailer , before he died , in the last interview said , " Every little bit of my book , killed me a little bit more " an extraordinary affermation about work .
But we 're not going to hold it , because we 've heard these things so long that we 've heard these things so long that in some way , we have completely interized and accepted the notion that creativity and suffered the art , at the end , it 's going to always always .
And the question that I want to bring to all here today is : are you agree with this idea ?
Now , you 're going to do this , because also watch it from a centimeter of distance to me is not good for this supposed position .
I think it 's hated .
And I think it 's dangerous and I don 't want to see the perpetuated perpetuate in the next century .
I think it 's better to encourage our big creative minds to live .
And I certainly know that , in my case -- in my situation -- it would be very dangerous to begin to fuse the danger of supposed to be in my career .
That is -- I mean , you look , it 's pretty young , I have about 40 years old .
I still have about four decades of work in me .
And it 's a lot of likely to write in now , it 's going to be judged by the world like the work that came out of my last book .
I 'm going to be , because we 're all more or less friends here -- it 's likely that my greatest success is to my shoulder .
Oh , Gesus , who thought !
You know this is the kind of thinking that brings a person starting to drink in the nine of the morning and I don 't want to do that .
I would continue to do this work .
So , the question becomes , how ?
And therefore , it seems to me , that the way of working to keep writing is to create a psychological construction , right ?
I 've got to find a security distance between me , which I 'm writing , and my natural anxiety about what reaction is going to be able to achieved . And , I was looking for all the time , trying to find other societies to see if they could have better ideas and more healthy ideas to see if they could have better ideas more and more healthy ideas .
It 's about how to help creative people to deal with emotivity of creativity .
And that research took me to the ancient Grek and an ancient Rome .
Seguitem because I 'm going to go back .
In the ancient Grek and ancient Rome -- people didn 't seem to believe that creativity came from men , OK ?
And he thought that creativity was this spirit watch divine , and that came to the men from some source and unknown , for distant reasons and unknown , for distant reasons .
The Greeks called the spiriters of creativity .
Socrate , wonder , he believed to have a life-eling demon wisdom .
The Rooms were of the same idea , but they called that kind of spirit without a genius .
which is great , because Rooms didn 't really think that a genius were particularly smart .
They thought that a genius was this kind of divine , which had literally believed in the walls of an artist , a little bit like the elpho Dobby , and that they came out to see the work of hidden , and I came up with the result of the artist and modeling the result of that work .
Here 's what I 'm talking about -- this is the distance of which I talk about -- that psychological construction that you protect your work .
And everybody knew it was how it worked , right ?
So the ancient artists were protected by certain things , like , for instance , not ?
If your work was exceptional , you couldn 't take all the place , everyone knew that you were helped to this incorporate genius .
If your work failed , it was not all your failed , right ?
Everybody knew that it was your genius to be an unable .
And so people han conceived in creativity for a long time .
And then the Renaissent came up and everything changed , and this great idea ; we put the human being the center of the universe above all the mysteries and the mysteries and without leave space creatures .
This was the principle of rational , and people began to think that creativity came to thinking that creativity was completely from the issues .
And for the first time in history , you began to referred to this or artist as a genius that one person with genius .
And I have to tell you , I think it was a big mistake .
I think that allowed someone , a simple person believes to be as a recipient as a source , the essence and the source of all the mysteries , creativity , unknown as an unknown responsibility , an unknown responsibility for a file human psychologists .
It 's like to ask someone to enjoy the sun .
Demot and distores the ego , and it creates all of these inexible expectations on performance .
And I think it was this pressure that I 've been destroyed to 500 years old .
And , if this is true , and I think it is , the question becomes , and now ?
Can we do that differently ?
Maybe you can go back to a more ancient understanding of the relationship between human and creative mystery .
Or maybe not .
Maybe we can 't cell 500 years of rational thinking in a talk of 18 minutes .
And there 's probably people in the audience that would have a legitimal suspects on the notion of , you know , you know that they follow the next to their projects .
I 'm probably not going to convince you all about this .
But the question I 'd like to ask is , why not ?
Why don 't we think about this ?
Because it has more sense of everything else that I 've ever heard to explain the exasperant impremobility of the creative process .
A process that , as anyone who ever tried to do something -- so , fundamentally , everyone here -- you don 't know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you don 't know .
And in fact , it can sometimes be completely paranormal .
I did this meeting recently with the extraordinary poetry Ruth Stone , who 's 90 years old old , but that was a poetry for all of life and told me that during his childhood in the rural Virginia , worked out out in the camps .
He said he was like a frageous air train .
And that was rotling to her from the landscape .
He felt it , because he had to tremendous the earth under his feet .
He knew he had one thing to do to do at that point , and it was of words , " running as a match . "
And so it goes to the house , and it was going to come up with this poetry , and he wouldn 't have to take a little piece of paper and a matt enough , as the traps , collecting it and grimp it on the page .
Sometimes you couldn 't be fast enough , so correct and correct and correcves without able to get to the house and poetry , and he would continue to rotoling through the landscape , looking for , as she said , " another poet . "
And then there were those times -- this piece , I 'm not going to forget that -- there were moments in which almost losing , OK ?
So , he was running home , and he was looking for paper , and he was looking for paper in , and he was going to go through , and then he said , that he was like , and then he said , that it was as if you flew up with the other hand and accident .
He had the poetry from the tail , and he remaining it in his body , and it turned it on the page .
And in these cases , the poetry would be presented on the perfect page , from the last word to the first one .
So when I heard that I thought -- it 's crazy , it 's exactly equal to my creative process .
Not all my creative process -- I 'm not a convict !
I 'm a mulo , and my way of working is ; I 'll wake up at the same orary every day , and I 'm going to play and work and pass over goffly .
But even I , in my head , I 've been stripped on that thing , sometimes .
And I guess a lot of you the han .
You know , even though the work and ideas came to me from a certain source , you can 't know it .
And what is that ?
And how can we relate it to it in a way that we don 't lose your head , but , rather , what do we remain healthy ?
So , for me , the best contemporary example I have is the musicist Tom Waits , which I interviewed several years ago for a newspaper .
We were talking about this , and you know , Tom , for the majority of life was the incarnation of the incarnation , trying to control , dominating these species of impulses .
But then he got up , and he cry , and one day he was driving on a street in Los Angeles , he changed everything for him .
It was going to fast , and all of a sudden , this little piece of melody , who comes in his head as inspiration as the inspiration , elusive , and it wants , you know , it 's wonderful , and it wants , but not knows how to take it .
It 's not a piece of paper , it doesn 't have a matt , it has no register .
So it starts to hear this kind of old anxioning him , " I 'm going to lose , and I 'm going to lose , and I 'll be obsessed by this song .
I 'm not good enough and I can 't do it . "
And instead of going to go to the panic , stop .
And I 'm going to do this whole mental process and did something completely new .
He just just looking at the sky and said , " Sit , I 'm not going to see that I 'm driving ? "
" Do you think it can write a song now ? "
If you really want to have , you go back to a more opport when I can take care of you .
Otherwise , you 're going to care for someone else today .
You 're going to disturbing Leonard Cohen . "
And his working process changed this .
Don 't work , the work was still obscure as always .
But the process , and the heavy anxiety was released when the genius , the genius that the gene out of him , the genius would remain it back where it was , by realizing that he didn 't have to be a interized thing .
But you know this peculiar , wonderful bizarre collaboration in a conversation between Tom and this strange thing that but not Tom .
So what I heard that story began to change a little bit the way that I was working , and I 'd already save me a time .
This idea , rescued me when I was writing " Mangia , Prega , Ama , " and falls in one of the disperation where we 're going to work on something and we can 't start thinking that it will be a disaster , which is going to be a disaster , which is going to be the worst book ever written .
Not just bad , just the worst book written .
And I started thinking to throw this project .
But then I remember Tom who talked to the air and I tried it .
So I got my face up to my face on the dark , and I made my committed a vacuum corner .
And I said , " Look , what you know , both of you , you know that if this book is not going to be brilliant , no ?
Because as I see I 'm putting everything I have , I don 't have this .
So if you want it to be better , you have to show you and do your side .
OK . But if you don 't do it , you know what , I don 't do anything .
I 'm going to tell you why it 's my work .
And I 'd like to do for me to do today to do my part . " Because -- at the end is so , OK -- at the end is so , OK -- I mean , a centuries ago in the North Africa , people would date for the dances of moon , dances and music to go to go on and hours to the stuff .
And they were always magnificent , because the dancers were professionals and they were great .
But every time , rarely , something happened , and one of these artists had become transcendent reality .
And I know what I 'm talking about , because I know you 've all seen it , a certain point , a performance so .
It was like the time , and the dancer walked through a kind of baller , and he was not doing anything different from usually , like 1,000 noticed before , but everything comes out .
And suddenly , you know , not just as a human .
But it turns out to the diin the divinity of divinity .
And when this happened , the time , the people knew what it was , they called it .
They had their hands and began to sing , " Allah , Allah , Allah , Allah , God , " God , " God , " God , " God , " God , " God . "
That 's God , you know .
Curious note -- when the Mori invaded the south of the Spain , I got this habitude with them and pronounce changed in the centuries of " Allah , Allah , Allah , Allah , " to " Ole , " , " that you can still feel in the corrids or the flamp .
In Spain , when a artist did something impossible and magic , " Allah , " Allah , " Allah , " Sylah , magnificent , good , " incomprehensible , it -- one of God .
And it 's great because we need it .
But , the problem comes the day , for the dancer himself , when you wake up and discovers that are 9 / 11 in the morning of Martedesh , and I don 't have anymore .
It 's just a great bad mortal to the ginoches , and maybe it 's not going to be able to get that height .
And maybe no one will sing the name of God , and what does it have to do with the rest of his life ?
It 's hard .
This is one of the most sweet recognize to do in a creative life .
But perhaps it doesn 't have to be so tremendous if you can 't believe , mostly , that the most extraordinary aspects of your being from yourself .
But you 're just believed that you 're going to prested by an inimaginable source of this pointed part of your life that you have to go to someone else when you finished .
And , you know , if we think about this all changes .
And so I started thinking about it , and it 's certainly as I thought about it for several months during the book that I 'm going to do it , the dangerous , which I 'll be followed to my great successful .
And what I have to continue to tell me when I feel electric .
It 's not just your job .
It can take you for your part , whatever it can be .
If your work is dancing .
If the divine , absurd genius to advine some kind of wonderful , for one moment through your effort , for one moment through your effort , then , " Ole ! "
Otherwise , you do the same dance .
And " Ole ! " to yourself .
I think , and I think you have to teach it .
" Ole ! " to yond the same , even for having human love and wildlife and textal claws . "
Thank you .
Thank you .
June Cohen : Ole !
As you know , I 've already talked about some of these projects on the human genome , what it can mean and the discovery of the new set of genes .
Now , we 're starting a new path . We started digitalizing the biology and now starting from that digital code , we 're coming into a new phase of biology , designing and synthetize life .
We always tried to bring great questions .
" What is life ? " It 's something a lot of biological , I think have tried to understand vary .
We tried different processes , reduced it to the minimum terms .
We 're digitizing for almost 20 years .
When we sequenced the human genome was to go from the analogical world of the digital biology in the digital world .
Now , we can regenerate life , or create a new life from this digital universe ?
This is the map of a small organism , Mycoplasma genitalium , which is the smallest genome from the smallest genome of the smallest genome .
And we tried to reduce the genome to create one smaller .
We can eliminate a hundred genes of about 500 that are here .
But when we look at his metabolic map , it 's relatively simple to our own .
Let me believe me , this is simple .
But when we look at all the genes that we can eliminate , one at the time , it 's very unlikely that this can bring a living cell .
So we decided that the only way we decided to synthesize this chromosoma so that we could modify the components to bring some of these fundamental questions .
And so we started the adventure of " we can synthesize a chromosome ? "
Can the chemistry to take these big molecules that we 've never been able to create before ?
And , in case , can we make a chromosome ?
A chromosome is just an inhert chemical material .
The speed with which we 're able to digitize life is growing to exponential .
Our ability to write the genetic code , instead , promises quite slowly , but it 's improving .
And our most recent resulate resulate resulate results .
We started over 15 15 years ago .
The process has required a lot of passages , starting with a bioetic required before we started experiments .
But we found that synthesize DNA is very difficult .
There are tens of thousands of machines in the world that produce little segments of DNA , in 30 to 50 letters , and it 's a degenerative process : the segment is longer , more mistakes there are .
So we had to develop a new method to assembly these fragments and correct the mistakes .
And this was our first attempt , to go from the digital genome of Phi genome , 174 .
It 's a little virus that kills bacteria .
We designed the fragments ,
And the interesting part is when we took this piece of inert chemical material , and we put it in the bacteria , the bacteria have started to read this genetic code and viral particles .
The viral particles have been released by the cells , they went back and destroyed the Excles .
I talked about recent with membres of the oil industry by by saying that they certainly compresed this .
They have more than you .
We believe that this is a situation where software can really build its own hardware in a biological system .
But we wanted to do the bigger things .
We wanted to build the whole chromosome of the bacteria .
It 's over 580 thousand letters of genetic code .
So we thought we 're going to build this in the size of the virus , so that we can change the cassits to understand what the components of a living cells .
The design is crucial , and if we start with digital information in a computer , these have to be very accurate .
When we sequenced this genome for the first time in 1995 accuractivity was of a mistake for every 10 miles .
We 've discovered , 30 mistakes , 30 mistakes . If we had that original sequence would never be able to do it work .
One part of the process is to design a 50 segments that underlying up with all the other 50 letters to 50 letters to build subunits to build subunits to build subunits of smaller than working together .
We 're an unique elements here .
You probably have read that we 're going to read that we put in the side .
Think about four letters . We have a genetic code based on four letters : A , C , G and T.
Three of those letters put together with about 20 adacids , and there 's a specific order of readers , and there 's a specific order of reading for every amminacid .
So we can use the genetic code to write words , sentences , thoughts .
What we 've done at the beginning was autographed .
Some of them have been disappoetry .
We designed these segments to just join them with enzes .
There are enzymes that repair them and put them on them .
And we began to assemble of parts , starting with segments from five to seven thousands of reading , unended up to 72 thousands of leckers at 24 thousands of letters to get 72 mile .
So , every step , we produced these segments in abundance , so we can sequence them that we 're trying to create an extraordinary processing -- how you 'll see in a minute .
We 're trying to automatize the process .
So , this seems like the tabellon a basket player .
When we get to these very long segments , more than 100 miles basis , you 're not going to grow more directly in the E.
It comes to the limit of modern molecular biology .
So we looked at other mechanisms .
We knew about another mechanism that we knew about one more meaning , that in biology is useful to repair the DNA able to join the DNA to bring segments .
Here 's an example .
This organism , called Deinococcus radiodurans , it can absorbs three million radiation .
You can see in the superior as his chromosoma is destroyed .
In 12 -- 24 hours , it turns out exactly as it was before .
There are thousands of organisms that are able to do it .
These organisms can sit completely .
They can live under empty .
They 're absolutely certain that life exists in space , and you feel to find new rich water environments .
ASA showed it that NASA showed this this .
This is an image of the molecule that we built using these processes , simply by using yeast design of segment .
The yeast assembled them automatically .
This image is not taken with an electric microscope , but with a regular microscope .
It 's a big molecule that we can see it with a light microscope .
These are photos that cover a period of about six seconds .
This is the advertising that we did a little time ago .
It 's over 580,000 letters of genetic code .
It 's the biggest molecule of a defined structure .
It has a 300-molecular molecular weight .
If you 're going to stick with a 10 without spaces , it would like 142 pages , just to get this genetic code .
Now , how do we do that ? How can we activate it ?
Of course , you take a virus is a game from kids .
It 's a little bit more complicated when they use bacteria .
It 's easier , even when it comes from eucariariods like our : you can simply extract the nucleus and put each other , which is basically the process of cloning process .
In the bacteria , the chromosome is instead of integrated in the cell , but we have recently demonstrated that we 're able to do a bunch of a chromosome from one cell to another and activate it .
We purified a chromosome from a microbial species .
The two are different as men from the mouse .
We 've added a few genes more so that we can decide what to choose for this chromosome .
And then , I 'm going to kill all the proteins .
And when we put it in the cell was wonderful -- and you 'll appreciate our sophisticatomic graph -- the new chromosome -- the new chromosome .
And we began to think we couldn 't go beyond , but we tried to push it over there .
This is one of the biggest mechanisms of evolution .
We 've discovered that a lot of species have added species a second , or a third chromosome somewhere , adding in a second thousand tracts to that species .
So who thinks about evolution as one gene at the time that has not understood a lot of the biology .
They have an enzyme called restriction enzyme that they 're going to type the DNA .
The chromosome was in the cell not one .
The cell phone , the chromosome that we have insert --
It 's expressed , and he recognized the other as sumranean material chromosoma material , and we found us with only the cell and the new chromosome .
It has become blue because of the genes that we put in .
And in a short amount of time , all the characteristics of a species have gone . And it turned all into a new species , based on the new software that we put into the cell .
All the proteins changed , the membranes have changed , and when we read the genetic code is exactly what we 've transferred to .
Now , this might seem to look at all , but altering the DNA software , we can change the things that is quite substantial .
Now , I 've already explained that you don 't talk about genesployed by three million years of evolution , and I said that maybe we 're going to create a new version of Cambrian explosion in which will be created new species on this digital process .
Why do that ?
I think it 's obvious when we think about our needs .
We 're going to move from six and a half billion people in the next 40 years .
Just to give an example : I 'm born in 1946 .
Now there are three people on the planet for each one existing in 1946 years , there will be four .
We 're having problems right now to find food , fresh water , fresh water and well-and-a-half billion people .
It 's going to be even more hard to do it for nine billion .
We use more five billion carbon than five billion carbon , more than 30 billion bureyes .
It means a hundred million barrels a day .
When we try to find these biological processes , or all kinds of process to replace , it 's going to be a huge challenge .
And we 've got to realize that all the emission of CO2 from these materials that end up in the atmosphere .
And today , thank you to scientific discoveries around the world , we have a database with about 20 million genes , and I like to think they are the design components for the future .
The electronic industry has only a dozen about components , and think about how many different things came out .
Our limitations are principles from the biological reality and our imagination .
Now , we 've got some techniques , thank you very quickly synthesization , to create what we call combinatory genomics .
We 're able to build a big robot that can produce a million chromosomes a day .
Think of processing these 20 million genes , or to try to optimize the processes to produce eight or drugs , new vaccines , we can change , thank you for a little team , and create more biology now that in the last 20 years of science .
And it 's just a standard selection .
We can choose for a chance to survival , chemical production , or fuel production of vaccines .
This is an instantaneful of some software programmed that we 're working to be able to sit ourselves and design species to computers .
Well , we don 't know how they 're going to be .
We know exactly how their genetic code .
Now , we 're focusing on the fourth generation .
You 've also seen you that to extract thanol out of the gran experiment finished finished .
We have carbons of second and third generation that are going to be used to be soon from the higher carbon dioxide , or different types of butants .
But the only way that biology can have a great impact without increasing the cost of the food and limitating the cost of food and limitating the cost of food and limitating the display of food , so we 're working to design cells that can achieve this . And we think we can have the first carbs of quarter generation in about 18 months .
The solar sunlight with CO2 is a metodo-- but in our discoveries around the world , we 've found different methods .
This is a organism that we 've described in 1996 .
It lives in the deep ocean , about 2,500 feet depth of the water temperature of ebollition of water .
CO2 , they create a molecular hydrogen molecular hydrogen of energy .
We 're trying to figure out if we can incanalate CO2 , which can easily be transported through , converting that CO2 in carbon , to drive this process .
So , short , we think we might be able to increasing what the basic question of " which is , " What 's life " is " We , grew up . "
Exactly . If you can 't do that from TED , where can you ?
It would become a main of energy .
Also , we 're working to use the same metods to create an instantaneous vaccines .
You 've seen this year with the flu , we 're always going back to a year and with a dollar when it comes to find the vaccine .
I think that you can change by building vaccines .
Here 's how the future could start to look at , now , the evolution tree , accelerating evolution with synthetic bacterial bacteria , arching , and then eucarious cells .
We 're at the improving people .
Our purpose is to do in a way of living enough to try to do it . Thank you very much .
First of all I 'm going to show you , the fastest possible , some fundamental of the new technology that we brought to the Microsoft in the following a acquire almost a year ago . This is Seadron .
This is an environment in which you can interact with a huge amount of visual data that remotion with a huge amount of visual data .
Here we 're seeing a lot of gabytes of digital phoom with a kind of stopping and continuous , for a panoramics , for a leavor , aving the images as we want to .
And it doesn 't matter how big the amount of information that we see , how big this is the amount of data or images .
Most are common photographs , but this is a scanning scan from the Library of the Congress of Congress , and it turns out in 300 megapixel .
It doesn 't make any difference because the only thing that limits prestations of a system like this is the number of pixel on your screen in any time . It 's also a very flexible architecture .
This is a whole book , example of data not images .
This is the Casa desolate Dickens . Each colonna represents a chapter .
To show you that it 's just about texture and not images , we can do something like that , to actually see that it 's a real representation of the text , not a picture .
It could be a little artificial way to read an electronic book .
Don 't you know it .
This is a more realistic example . It 's a number of the Guardian .
Each picture is the beginning of a section .
And it really gives you the pleasure experience to read the real version of a magazine or a newspaper , or a newspaper , which is for a lot of nature .
We 've also done something with the corner of this particular number of The Guardian .
We 've created a higher advertising advertising advertising of what you use in a normal advertising -- and we put an extra content .
If you want to see the characteristics of this automobile , you can see here .
Or other models , or even the specific techniques .
And this really shows some of these ideas to eliminate the limitations of space on the screen .
We hope that this is going to end up the pop-up and other porcheries like that , you don 't have to be necessary .
Of course , the map is one of the most obvious applications for this kind of technology .
And I don 't want to lose time , if we don 't want to lose them in this field .
These are all the streets in the United States , there 's a geospace of NASA .
So now we go to something else .
Now , this is actually from the Web ; you can go to see it .
This is a project called Photosynth , which combine two different technologies .
One is Seadragon , and the other is a very interesting visual research in Noah Snavely , a student of the University of Washington , with Steve Seitz in the UW Seitz of Microsoft Rick Szeliski of Microsoft Rick Szeliski Rick Szeliski .
And it 's from the Web , managed by Seadron .
You can see it when we do this kind of screen , where we can spend from one image to the other and have this kind of experience .
But the spatial location of pictures has actually a meaning .
The computer visualization algorithms have recorded these pictures together , so that correspond to real places in which correspond to the real places in which imagine them -- all over to the Rocketian Montagne . So here you see the elements of one slides -- you see the elements of a de-stable imaging , and these things were all lines .
I don 't know if I have time to show you some other environment .
There are a lot more space .
I want to spend directly to one of the Noah-- and this comes from a previous prototype of Photosynthy Photosynthetic that we 've done for the first summer last -- to show you what I think is really the key to behind this technology , Photosynth . And it 's not necessarily looking at the environments that we 've put in the website .
We had to worry about legal aspects and so on .
This is a reconstruction of Notre Dame images in the Flickr . Basta digites Notre Dame in Flickr and you get images of types , other of the campus and so on the campus and so on . Each one of these orange orange areas is discovered to this model .
So they 're all linked images from Flickr and they 're connected to this way .
And it 's possible to navigate this very simple way .
You know , I never thought I would end to work for Microsoft .
It 's very gratifying to receive this kind of acaked up here .
I think you can see that it 's a lot of different kinds of photocameras : from the cell phones to those professional SLR , a significantly number , put together in this environment .
And if I can , I try to look for those strange .
A lot of them are blocked by faces , etc .
Somewhere there is a series of photographs -- here .
This is a poster of Notre Dame poster Dame recorded .
We can go from the poster to the physics of this environment .
The essential point is that we can do things with social environment . This is now taking data from supply protective data from the whole memory of how it looks like the Earth , from the visual point of -- and connects all of that data together .
All those pictures become connected together , greater than the sum of the parts .
You 've got a model of the land that emergency .
Think about this as a prolungation of Stephen Lawler 's work on Earth .
It 's something that grows in complexity as well as people use it , and the advantages for people to use it .
Their photos are husbed by other people .
If someone comes the idea of contradicing all of these sorts , my picture of Notre Dame , sudden , my picture of Notre Dame , suddenly , I can use it as well as a immerely dive for immersing in that space , in that metapuniverse , using the photos of anyone , and have a social experience of a cross-mode experience .
Of course , a consequence of all of this are virtual models of all the interesting part of the land , collective , not only you know about open and similar pictures and similar images and similar pictures and similar pictures and similar pictures and similar images , but from the collective memory .
Thank you .
Chris Anderson : I realized what your software is going to take us to do is that , at a certain point , in the next few years , all the photographs shared by anyone in the world are going to be practically connected together ?
BAA : Yes . What 's doing is basically discovering .
It 's creating hyperlink , if you want , between images .
And he 's doing it in the content of images .
And the thing becomes very interesting if you think about the semantement of semantic information that many of these images .
As a research research on the Web , you know , you have a phrase and the text on the Web page has a lot of information about pictures .
Now , what happens if you connect all of your photos ?
So , the amount of semantic interconnection , and the amount of wealth is really enormous . It 's a classic effect of the network .
CA : Blaise , it 's really unbelief .
BAA : Thank you very much .
One of the main pleasure , when you travel up and one of the Ethnographics is that we can live between who has not forgotten the antial traditions , between the wind , you have an earlier in the wind , you have the past in the wind , your stones out of the plants .
Jaguar thinking that the sciamani Jaguar traveling again , but the Milky Way Mild Via , or Himalaya , or Himalaya , or Himalaya , the budress still the breath of the Dharma , to remember the central importance of anthropology , and the idea that the world that we live in sense , but it 's just a model of reality , but it 's just a model of reality ,
the consequence of a particular adapative choices that our estrpe has done , well or bad , many generations ago .
And , of course , we all share the essential traits .
Everybody is birth . We all try .
We 're subjects to start .
We 've got to face the inexorability of death , so we don 't surprise to us if we 're going .
We all have an art .
What hits is the particular rhythm of the song , the rhythm of every culture .
It doesn 't matter that are the Penan forests of the Borneo , or the follow of the Vodoo 's Vodoo , or the desert the Kenya , and the Curandrooth in Kenya , the Curandero of the Ande , or a camp in the Sahara .
And he was my journey of journey in the desert a month ago , or the yak in the yak of the Kiverest , on the Everest , the world 's mother .
All of these populations teaching us that there are other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , other ways of moving around the world .
And if you reflect a moment , it 's a concept that it can give you hope .
So , again , the world 's myries create a ragd of a spiritual life and cultural , which is important for the well-being , and it 's important for the well-being of the planet as a biosphere .
And you can think of this ragder as cultural as an etnosphere , and you can define the total sum of all the conception of all the concepts , dreams , ideas , inspiration , intuitions , intuitions , intuitions , to be intuitions ,
The etnosphere is the fantastic patriage of humanity .
It 's the symbol of what we are and what we can be as inquisitive .
And because of the biosphere has been quite consumed as long as it happened to the etnosphere , and very quickly faster .
No biologist , for example , it would say that 50 percent of all the species is on the orders , just because it 's fake , or -- in the most apocalymal diversity -- and it 's not even close to the most optimistic issues to the most optimistic issues of cultural diversity .
The index of that is , of course , language loss .
When you were born 6,000 languages on this planet .
One language is not just a vocabulated , or a series of a series of rules .
A language is the human spirit of the human spirit .
It 's the medium that the animal of every culture comes in the material world .
Every language is a forest of the mind , a backin , a thought , an ecosystem possibility .
And of those 6,000 languages , while we 're here sitting in Monterey , at least half it 's not supplies to the children .
They 're no longer taught to children , which means , unless you taught something , which is already died .
What is there more sad than the silence , of being the last to talk a language , of being the last to talk a language , which is not supposed to transmit the wisdom of the wisdom of the kids ?
This is a facing faced of someone in the world every two weeks : every two weeks a manufactured in the tombottom of the sillables and door with it in the tombottom of a language .
And I know some of you will say , " Isn 't that better ?
The world wouldn 't be a better place to talk about all the same language ? "
We talk about kogi .
So you 're going to have to say , not to be able to talk about your language .
And I 'd like to give you a journey through the thnosphere --
a little journey in the etnosphere to give you an assage of what we 're losing .
Many of us forget that when I say , " different ways of there are really different ways of there .
So let 's take for example , Barasana Barasana , in Amazon , the anacond the people of anaconda , which believes the myth to come to come from the river of the eest saconth of sacred sacres .
It 's a popular that it 's not able to distinguish the blue blue from the green because you were identified in the forest , which depends the popular .
They have a strange language and a matrimonial rule , detect " examia " , " You have to marry a different language .
So , all that has radics in the past mitologic , which is that in these exese families in these exese families in which they talk to six or seven languages because of marries marries of no one practical practice .
They 're limited to listen and then they start talking .
We take one of the most interesting tribe with which I lived , the Waorans of Ecuador north , an incredible people who had the first contact in 1958 .
In 1957 , five missionarious missionary contact .
They made off the top photographs that they found them in the picture that they would have loaded , and forest that this people of pluvial forest had never seen anything bi-dimensional size .
They picked up the photos , they spend it to a shape or a shape , and , not finding anything , have concluded that it was the hell , and they killed the five missionaries .
But Waorans don 't kill the foreers .
They kill between them .
54 percent of the mortality was caused by themselves .
We 're eight generations to eight generations , and we 've found two natural death , and when we insisted to know , have admitted that one of them was invectured so that he died , and then kill him killed him him the same .
The hunters were able to recognize the 40 steps and recognize the species .
In the early ' 80s , I was assigned a really interesting task when my professor of Harvard asked me if I wanted to go to Harvard to the basis of Duvalier and Tonton Macoutes and Tonton Macoutes and Tonton Macoutes , and impossssmart me .
To give a sense of the miraculous , I would have to understand Vodoo culture is not magic .
It 's quite quite a complex view of the world .
Very interesting .
If I ask you to tell me the great religions of the world , what would you say ?
Christianity , Islam , Buddismo , Ebraism , etc .
A continent is always left out , thinking that sub-Saharan Africa has no religious feeling . And instead yes and Vodoo not the other than the distilside of these religious concepts , very profound in the tragic concepts .
What makes a interesting voodoo is the intense relationship between life and death .
So , you have to hid the spirits .
The spiriters can be invoced by the Great Acqua , response to the dance of the dance of the dance of the dance , and they replace to be that for a brief active .
So , the voodoomers like to say , " You white the white you go to talk about God .
We say in the temple , and we become God . "
And from the moment that you 're inspirit , it 's the spirit that you 're driving , as you can get in ?
So you see these incredible events : followed voodoo in the state of trance that touches impuntizing infues a demonstrated demonstration of the power of mind , when it 's catalyzed in a state of extreme excitation .
At all the people I lived the most extraordinary of the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta , in the Santa Marta , in Colombia .
Discending of the tyrannal civilian ancient time they were living on caraign plants in the Colombia in the Colombia , the people would retreated on the massive several security that you were going to caraic plants .
In a mundry continent blood , this people has never been conquisted by Spanish .
So , they 're governed by a clero , but their formation is so extraordinary .
The young people have taken away from the families to three or four years , and they live secret in a world of dark and shadows in the world of the ice for 18 years .
Two periods of nine years of the way to reproduce the nine months of management that they spend in the user of the mother , now are metaphically in the user of the Grange of Mad .
So , for all this time , they 're acculated to the values of their society , values that they preprayers and only their prayers keep the cosmic balance -- or to say the balance balance .
At term of this incredible initiation , they 're suddenly taken out and for the first time in their age of 18 years , they see a dawn . And in that activity of the first ball of the landscape , when the sun landscape , everything that they 've learned in theory . The prete a step back . And the prete a step back and he says , and he says ,
" I said , " Five as I told you .
It 's wonderful . It 's now to you protect it . "
They 're called the major brothers , and they say that we , the mines of destruction destruction of the world .
This level of intuition is extremely important .
When we think about indigenous people and the environment invau and the old story of the noble wild , which is a razy concept in its simplicity or maybe invote Thoreau and we say that these people are closer to Earth .
Ingenes are not no feeling or feeling .
There is no space for these things in the malaric paludators or the winds of the Tibet , but thank you very mystics , but thank you very mystic intuition of the Earth 's not about the concept of it , but by a mystical intuition , the concept that that the Earth can only live because it 's infused by human consciousness .
What does that mean ?
It means that a boy of the Ande who grow up the mountain believes that the mountain is an Apu , who will lead his destate is going to be a very different human being , and it 's going to have a very different report with the mountain , or a respect of the Montana is growing that a mountains is a lower of rocks
Which is a dimora of a spirit or a mineral cycle is irrelevant .
What 's interesting is the metaphor that defines the relationship between the individual and the natural world .
I grew up in Columbia British 's Columbia believing the forests to be cut .
And that made me a human being different from my friends Kwautter who believe that the forests are the forests of Hamkuk and the bats of the paradise and the bal spiriters that live to the north of the world , spirits that they deal with during the Hamatsa .
If you begin to consider that these cultures could create different reality , you can start to understand some of their sense .
I took this picture to aprile in the nordoctor in the nordoctor .
Mayatheist of you have heard of the ayahuash , the most powerful psychoactive substance .
What makes it fascinating the ayahuasca is not the pharmacological potential of the substance , but his elaboration . It 's made by two elements .
On the one side , this liannose that has a series of carbolines , harm and harm and harmmolines , harmed hallucinogenic .
Taking the only plants , you have a bluster , which is a little bit of a consciousness , but it 's measured by the leaves of a coffee family told Psychotridis called Psychotridis .
This plant has powerful powerful triptamines , very similar to the serotonin , dimethoxptamine-5 , methoxtamine .
If you 're ever going to see the Yanomami you 're going to pulling up the nose that they have a different methoxydimethoxptamine .
Tiring that dust on the nose is a little bit like being disappeared by a bunch of paintings , and land on a sea of electricity . It doesn 't believe a distorsion of electricity .
I was often a lot of my professor , Richard Evan Shultes , the man who got down the psychedelic , with his discoveries of the fungi hallucinogens in the ' 30s in Mexico .
Second my tesis , you can 't class these tripptamines like hallucinogens , because you 're not going to tell no one of them to be hallucinated .
It 's possible to assume by the early one of the chemicals that you know , of the MAO .
Now , the nice is : beta-carbolines that are in this liants are in the MAO , the same kind of necessary to potential triptamines . The question spontaneous , in a flora of 80,000 species of plants , how do these people find two deges not similar , but if you combine in this way , create a biochemical version that is superior not similar , that if you combine in this way , create biochemistry .
We use the great eupher of the proof and the mile , which can reveal infruit .
But if you ask the Indians , they 'll tell us , " The plants will tell us . "
What does that mean ?
This tribes , the Cofan , has 17 variety of ayahuh , which distinguished in the forest , and that our eyes would come into the same species .
If you ask them , how they 're going to stabilion their tasonomics will tell us , " I thought , " I said , " No . "
The solution is : you take the 17 variety of a full moon , and you 'll have a different tone .
And this is not graduated to Harvard , but it 's much more interesting to count the stami .
Now , [ applausers ] the problem is that even the ones of us that we have a heart people who are painting them , but somehow redots to our real world , and pass beyond .
In fact , 30th century , in 300 years , it 's not going to be reminded for his wars or innovations , but rather as the one was where we stopped and accepted actively or accepted accepted , or accepted accepted , or accepted in the planet . Now the problem is not the change .
All the cultures through centuries have been involved in a dance for new possibilities of life .
And the problem is not technology .
The Indians Sioux , they don 't have to be Sioux when they put up the argue and they 're not going to be Americans when they put in the horse and calculus .
It 's not the change or technology that threatening the integrity of the etnosphere . It 's the power .
The laster face of the domination .
And if you look at the world , you 'll find that these aren 't destinated culture .
They 're living creatures and dynamics out of the identified identifies that go beyond their ability to adaptation .
I know that you have disboscaming in the Penan --
a people of Sarawak , in Sarawak , in Sarawak , a people who lived in the forest to a generation ago , and now reduced to a generation ago , and now reduced to the reports , where you can see the rivers of the rivers , where you can see the polluted that it seems to be half Borneo Meridional Meridional Meridional Meridional Cinese Meridiond , where you can see the illustrate ,
Woman : It 's going to fill the wood to the forest .
Or , in the case of the Yanomami , they 're the disease that came to with the gold .
If we go to the mountains of Tibet , where I 'm doing a lot of research , you 'll see the laster of the political domination .
As you know , the genocide , physical extinction of a popular , it 's a universal level , but the etnocide , the destruction of life , not only is convicted , not only is convicted , but even celebrated in some environments , because it 's part of the strategy of development .
And you can 't see the suffering of Tibet until you 're in the beginning .
I 've been through the 6,000 miles from Chengdu in the Western China through Tibet , and I got to Lhasa with a young connection , but only come to Lhasa , I realized what 's behind the statistics that we hear .
6,000 sacred sacred sacred in dust and cenables .
1.2 million people killed by the military during the Cultural Revolution .
The father of this guy was ascriticized at Panchen Lama .
which means that it was killed in the temple of the Chinese invasion .
Which is sweep with Sua Santity , during the diaspora that has brought the people in Nepal .
Her mother was imprigioned , and his colpe was to be rich .
It was brought to hidden in the age of the age of two borders under his gonna because he couldn 't live without him .
The sister , who did the same , has been mit in reducation .
And one day he inavailed a day hit a coffiger Mao and , for this transgression , it was put forced jobs for seven years .
The Tibet of the Tibet can be unbehind , but the inspirit of the people is from tener present .
And at the end , all , you reduces a choice .
We want to live in the monocromatical world of the monoonia or we want to acover the world of diversity ?
The great anthropologist Margaret Mead , before he said that his greatest fear was that , in our going to go towards this view of the world , not only to see the whole range of human imagination , but one day we 're going to see the whole range of the human imagination , but one day we 're going to get out of a sleep .
And it 's about 600,000 years old .
The Neolitic Revolution , who gave us the agriculture , which has done us socked us to subject the seed of the seeds , by creating the hierarchy , creating the hierarchy of specialization , and we talk about 10,000 years ago .
The modern industrialized world has 300 years .
What a story is not suggests that we have the answers that we have the answers to all the challenges that we 're going to have to deal with .
When to these myriaths of the world is asked what it means to be humans , they respond with 10,000 different voices .
And it 's in these answers that we all have a chance to be what we are : a kind of a consciousness , which has to make all of the people and all the gardens of optimism .
I took this picture on the northern extremity of Baffin the island , when I went to the whales of the Inuit , and this man , Olaya , Olaya , he told me the wonderful story of his grandfather .
The cannot government was not always gigentile with the Inuit , and in the ' 50s to stabilize our suprematic .
The grandfather of this man refused to go .
The family , I 'm pushed to his life , took him off all of his attitude .
You have to know that the Inuit doesn 't fit .
The leaves in origin were made of fishing skin .
The grandfather of this man didn 't met the night or the library , or from the library .
It 's sleep away , he calculated the pads in focuses and defecated in their hand . When they got them them up . When they got them elated , they worked a lama .
And he pushed on the points of this habit , and when it became solid , he killed a dog .
It took the dog and created a brillile , with the hacic cash has created a slevels , he imbrillied another dog , and he disappeared on the banks .
Do we want to talk about cavarself-resilience . And this , in different ways , [ Applausi is the symbol of the resilience of the Inuit and all of the indigenous people in the world .
In aprile , 1999 , the Canadian government has reached to the total control of an area of an area of the biggest California of the California and put together .
It 's their new patria . It 's called Nunavut .
It 's an independent territory . They take all the resources .
So , one splay example of how a natione-state can recognized with his people .
And , to finish , I think it 's pretty obvious , at least that we 've been in these remote areas of the planet , realizing that they 're not remote at all .
For someone is home .
They represent sexiety of human imagination to rest at the time . And for all of us , the dreams of these children , as the dreams of our children , become part of the geography of hope .
And finally , us of National Geographic we are convinced that politicians will never come to anything .
We believe that polemies --
[ Applausi is not persuasive , but we believe that stories can change the world , and maybe we 're the best institution to tell the stories of the world . Every month to tell the stories of the world .
156 countries transmitted our television channel .
Our reviews are letters from millions of people .
Our work is to travel in the etnosphere to bring our audience in places that are going to be able to get out of how much they have seen , and hopefully , abbracing for the central revelation of anthropology : the world of exists in the diversity , and we have to find a style of life in a pluralist and multicultural world in a pluralist and multicultural world .
where the wisdom of all the people can contribute to our collective well-being collective well-being .
Thank you .
I 'm going to talk to you about some things that I wrote in this book that I hope you 've heard , and I 'm going to try to figure out , in case you don 't notice them .
I 'd like to start with what I call " the official dogme . "
The officer of what ?
The officer of all the Western industrial societies . The official dogme , " If you want to massisixth of our citizens , " The way to do this is massive individual freedom . "
The reason is , from one side , in the fact that freedom is in itself a value , is uable , useful , essential for human beings .
At the other is that if we 're free , each one of us can act for their own to realize to do everything that massimilar well-being , without no no one that you 're going to do .
The way to massimilar freedom is massimilar to choice .
The more choices than people have , the more free , and greater is their freedom , greater is their well-being .
This is , I think , it 's so deeply rooted in society that no one would dreams to put it in doubt .
And it 's deeply roated in our lives .
I 'm going to show you some examples of what has made possible possible .
This is my supermarket . It 's not particularly big .
I lose a simple note about conditions .
In my supermarket , there are 175 conditions , without counting the 10 varieties of olive olive , and 12 aceters that you can buy for a huge amount of conditions that no one of the 175 ready is that one of the 175 ready is your degrees .
Here 's what the supermarket .
And then you go to the store of electronic to buy a stereo : you know , CD lector , radio lector .
And in this individual store , there 's a great number of electronic audio components .
We can do six million and a half of different combinations , using the components that there are in one store .
You have to admit there is a lot of choice .
Another fields : the world of communications .
Once , when I was a kid , you could get all the wild telephone services , which were forced by mom Bell .
You had the telephone , you didn 't buy it .
A consequence of that , another one was that the telephone didn 't break .
These days are gone .
Now we have a near variety of telephones , especially the cell ell phones .
Here are the cell phones of the future .
My favorite is the one in the middle lector MP3 , cut them out of the nose , and shapes for the brulthele .
If you haven 't seen the store in the store under house , you 're very well going to get .
And what happens to the end is that people go into the stops and this question . And you know what 's the answer ? The answer is " No . "
It 's not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn 't do too much .
So , in other aspects of life that are much more importantly than the acquired itself .
A lot of health care : doesn 't happen anymore in the United States that you go to the doctor and tell you what you have to do .
Instead , you go to the doctor , and the doctor says , " OK , we could do A , or B , " A has these benefits and the risks . What do you want to do ? "
You say , " Doc , what should I have to do ? "
And the doctor says , " A has these benefits , and you have these benefits , and you have these benefits . "
" What do you want to do ? "
And you say , " You know , what would you do ? "
And the doctor : " But I 'm not . "
The result , we call it " malate it , " expression that makes it look like this .
But in fact , it 's not that one move the weight and responsibility of making decisions from someone who knows something , which is the doctor , to somebody else knows anything -- and almost certainly it 's sick -- and almost certainly it 's not the ideal condition to make the patient patient decisions .
There 's an enormous marketing of pharmaceutical , direct people like me and you , that if you think you don 't have any sense , because you can 't buy them .
But if we can 't buy them , why do you get them ?
The answer is that they want to domorning , we call the doctor to ask them to change the recipe .
Something that 's so fundamental as our identity is a question of choice , as you see in this wildlife . " We don 't want to force the children . " We don 't want to force the children . " We don 't have to invent it .
And we can reinvent how many times us .
which means that every morning , you have to decide that kind of person wants to be .
It turns out to the family and marriage , a time perspective , a common perspective for anyone , it was that you had the most soon possible , and it started to get the most soon possible .
The only real choice was with who , not when , and even what to do after that .
So , all of it 's really to play .
I teach them to very smart students , and I do 20 percent at least than a time .
And not because they are not bright , not because they 're undiligent .
but why I 'm impensierated , intent to ask , " Do I have to marries or not ? " Do you have to do it right now ? "
" Do I have to marriler ? "
They 're interrogatives .
And they try to respond to these questions , although this is not complete the homework , and I 'm not going to get a good vote to my examples .
And they really have to do this . They 're important .
Now , the work : we 're lucky , like Carl , because technology allows us to work every minute , every day , from every day , from every day , from every day , from each corner of the Hotel Randolph .
At the parenth , there 's a corner , and I won 't tell anyone , where the WiFi works .
I don 't tell you , because I want to use it .
What does this mean , this incredible freedom of choice that we have to do about work ? Is that we have to decide , continually , if we have to work or not .
We can go to see our child playing soccer , with the mobile phone in one pocket , the Blackberry in the other , and the notexture .
And even though they 're all spent , every minute that we see our child , we 're also asking the game , we 're also asking this , " Do I have to respond to this called ? "
" I have to answer this email ? "
And even when the answer is " no , " all this makes the experience of your own child , very different from what it would be in other conditions .
So , anywhere we look , little things , big and large , material objects and lifestyle , life is a question of choices .
Once the world was this : I mean , there were some possibilities , but it was not a question of choice .
The world 's world looks like this : The dilemma is , " Is it a good thing , or negative ? "
The answer is Sure .
And the positive lates that we all know , so I 'm going to talk about negatives .
So , all this choice , two negative effects on people .
The first one , paradowically , is that produced paralleation instead of liberation .
With a lot of options between which chooses , becomes very difficult to do it .
I 'll give you an example , a conduct example , a conduct example .
A colleagues had access to the Vanguard data , the gigantic societies of depension , with about a million customers in 2,000 different companies .
What she discovered is that for every 10 solutions that are offered in more , the percentage of two percent of them .
With 50 offer funds , there 's 10 percent in less than adhhesions than only five . Why ?
Because with 50 founds between which choosing , it 's sickly difficult to decide , and the choice is remainly hard to decide .
And tomorrow , and again , tomorrow , tomorrow , tomorrow , and of course , it 's never coming .
You know that it doesn 't just mean that these old workers .
Don 't participating , they 're losing up to five thousand dollars for a year from work , which is well-disposed .
So paralysis is a consequence of having too many choices .
And I think that makes the world like this .
" And to end up , for ethernity : ketchup , senape or maion ? "
You would just take the right decision , if it 's for the eternity , isn 't it ?
You don 't want to choose the wrong bottom , and the wrong condition .
So this is the first effect . The second is that even though we can avoid the parallel and do a choice , at the end , we 're less result of the result of how we would have been with less options in which choosing .
And this for different reasons .
One of these is that with a lot of condition between which you choosing , and it 's not a perfect , it 's not easy to imagine that you would have done a different choice that you could have been better . And what happens is that the alternative imagints would have been better . And what happens is that the alternation of choice , and repeopping the sodaties of choice ,
even when it was a good decision .
More choices there are more , it 's easier than any details that it 's unsatisfactor of choice .
Also , there 's what economists call it cost .
Dan Gilbert asked very well stamats as the value that we value to things depends on what we confronted them .
And the rest , when there are a lot of options , it 's easy to represent the features of alternative shot , and be less sophistic .
Here 's an example . I schools with everybody who are not in New York .
But that 's what you would probably think .
There 's this couple to the Hamptons .
It 's a luxury .
It 's all about spling-day . It 's all about them .
Not nothing . But what he thinks is , " Well , the advance , it 's Agotten . "
" All my neighbors in Manhattan are away . "
" I could talk about it right in front of home . "
And he spread two weeks assillated from the idea that 's losing -- every day -- the possibility of parking where it wants .
And the opportunity decreases decrease for what we have , even when the choice was excellent .
And the most are the options that we have to think , the more , attractive features are going to be going to be able to come up with the opportunity .
Here 's another example .
This is telling us a lot of things .
It talks about living the moment , and maybe a slowly .
But the most important point is that anything you want , you know , you 're not going to do .
The things that we don 't choose that we don 't choose can make less attractive what we do .
And the third point : growing the spiral of expectations .
I tried it on my skin buying a new couple of jeans .
It 's almost always jeans .
Once the jeans were just a guy , and they were going to bought them up , and they were modissized , only after having a lifetime , just after having a life and work .
So , I went to buy a couple of new when the old ones were gone , and I said , " I need a couple of jeans , this is my cut . "
And he said , " Do you want to be a fit , particularly fit , axed ? "
Do you take them with the cernian or buttons ? " Stonewashed , " or " acidwashed ? "
" Do you want to be layers ? "
" Do you want to leave them or stretch ? "
I was eventually , and after a while I was able to say , " I want the guy , which was the only guy , " He had no idea what it was , like , " It had no idea which was , so for an hour , and then out of the store , I said , " I want the best couple of jeans that I ever had .
It was the most most of that I had the best .
But I felt worse .
Why ? I wrote a whole book to understand it .
The reason I was worse is that with all that choice is that with all that choices were very high , jeans had to be perfect .
At the beginning , I didn 't expectations . I didn 't expect any exceptional when I saw 100 different people , accidents , at least one had to be perfect .
What I had taken was good , but not perfect .
After this choice with what I was trying to do with what I was trying to do is expectations .
The addition of options in life is not doing the expectations that they have respect to the excellence of the options .
And this is going to produce less satisfaction , even when the results are good .
No one in the world of the marketing came up with it .
Because if they knew it , you wouldn 't know what I 'm talking about .
The truth looks more like this .
" It was better when he was worse . " The reason he was better when he was worst when he was worse is that when he was worst of pleasure .
In the world , in which we live in -- opulent , industrialized citizens with the expectation of performance -- the massive that we can hope is that things are things in the height .
You never surprised that because your expectations , my expectations , my expectations .
The secret of happiness -- what you 're here -- it 's , " Baxis you 're expectations . "
I mean , a little biographic moment -- which I really married and my wife is really wonderful .
I couldn 't do it , I couldn 't do it .
But it 's not always a bad thing .
Finally , a consequence of buying a couple of jeans , when you have that jeans is that when you 're not satives , and ask you , " Why ? "
" Who is responsible ? "
The world is responsible .
When there are hundreds of types of jeans , and you buy a satisfacing , and you ask who is responsible , it 's the clear that responsible is you .
You would have done better .
With hundreds of variety of varieties , there are not excuses for insuccess .
So , when people take decisions , even though the result is valid , you feel like , and they 're insatisfied , and they hold their own .
In the last few years , depression is exploded in industry .
I think that a significantly factor -- not the only one , but important -- of this depression is that people have deludents , because standard experiences are too high .
And when they have to explain this situation , they think they 're going to be .
So the final result is that we 're better , objectively , but we feel worse .
Let me remember .
This is the official dogma , what we all take for good and it 's completely fake . It 's not true .
There 's no doubt that a little bit of choice is better that you don 't have it , but it 's not going to be a lot of choice is better than a little bit .
There 's a critical value . I don 't know what it is .
But I 'm sure we overcome from a piece , the level in which choices improve our life .
Now , from the political point of view -- I nearly finished -- from the political point of view , the cell is the following .
And what allows you all this choice in industrial society is the material wealth .
There are a lot of places in the world , and you know , where the problem is not that they have any choice .
The problem is that they have too long .
So the factory that I 'm talking about is a malbeing extraordinary of modern , Western society .
And what it does depress and angry is this : Steve Levitt Levitt talked about what expensive and seats for baby .
I mean that these choices , complicated , it 's not that they 're unuseful .
I 'm absolutely deleteries .
They are worse .
If a little bit of what our societies in our societies , it would be reversed in those where people have too few possibilities , not just their life to improve but our own life .
This is what economists call a paretian improvement .
A redistribution of income redistribution is good at all -- not only to the poor -- because of this choice for us .
To conclude , you can become everything you want . "
You know , culture , you think , " What does that fish ? "
" It 's obvious that you can 't do anything in a glass . "
" An imagination , a limited view of the world --
And I interpret it so , at the beginning .
But then , by thinking , instead , I realized that that fish is the long .
Because the reality of the facts is that if you 're missing the bottom , so that you can 't get the freedom . You get the paralysis .
If you break the bottom in a way that everything is possible to decrease .
You know , you know , and you reduce the well-being .
Everybody needs a sphere .
This is almost certainly too closely , maybe even for the fish , and certainly for us .
But the absence of some symbolic symbolic sphere is a recipe for childhood .
Thank you very much .
