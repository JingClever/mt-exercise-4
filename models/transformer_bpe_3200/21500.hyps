Last year , I showed these devices to show that the glacial calottica , which is almost three million years had the size of 48 million years had the size of 48 million years has had the size of 48 percent .
But this sub-valuable , the gravity of the problem because it doesn 't show the spessor of the ice .
The glacial calottica is , in a certain sense , the clean , the clean of the global climate system .
You can 't winter and you get ritate .
The next slide will be a quick relationship to the last 25 years .
The laces are signed in red .
You see , they expand until the blue .
That 's the ice in the winter , which is ritiating as you can get up .
You can see that the cosidbox , of five years or more , is like blood , which is like blood , which is like blood , which is like blood .
In 25 years , it 's past , at the way .
This is a problem because the heat at at the ground , the glacier around the ocean , where there are enormous amounts of fuel that , leaved , they 're transformed in the middle of microbes .
I 'm going to spect the totality of the atmospheric rescale , that could double , super-scale , that could double , overcome this point of not return .
In some of the laghi , in Alaska the meter is already rebolling from water .
The professor of Alaska University of Alaska was based on a team , at a team , a blow last hand-based lake a team of a fast last hell .
Video : Wow ! Gore : You 're right .
That 's why this termal exchange of the Groenland from the northermal .
This is a glacial regime .
The brought had never reached it .
This is the Kangerlussuaq , in the west of the Groenland .
If you want to know how the sea level for the sea level for the sea pack of the prails on the ground , here is where the sea .
These current current are very rapidly .
Another part of the planet : Antartide , the largest block of the planet .
The month scientist have dichiared that the bill is in the negative , and that the Western Antartide , which poggggames , which poggy on some isluns , is particularly rapid in the month .
Eququites at six feet of the activity , like in Groenland .
Sulla Himalayas , the third largest block of ice , you see new laghi , which is a few years ago .
40 percent of the population of the world 's population half of the water from that leavailable .
Sulle Ande : this glacier is the source of the water source of this city .
The layer has increased .
But when it comes up , it 's the same thing happens to water .
In California , the snow , in the Sierra Nevada is diminured 40 percent .
The kises are in crisis .
The predictions , as you read , are good .
The growth is secustomer in the world leads to a remarkable remarkable .
The environmental disaster , are increasing out of the normal and unprecedented .
Four times more numbers in the last 30 years I respect for 75 .
This is a whole insustainable .
If you look at the context , you can see the consequences .
In the last five years , we added 70 million tons of a 24 hours -- 25 million tons of tons in the ocean every day .
Look at the Eastern area , from the Americas , to the west , and on both the parts of the substent continent , where there 's a radical radical world .
The biggest cause of global warming , together to deforestation , which is 20 percent , is the fossil fuel use of fossil fuel .
The oil is even worse is worse .
The United States is one of two countries with more emissions , together to China .
And it was proposing to build a lot of other carbon dials .
But we 're seeing a way of a direction .
These are the anullated projects in the last few years and some green proposers .
Every way , there 's a political lopit in our country .
The fuel industry and oil have spent 250 million dollars in the last year to promote coal , which is a oxide , which is a oxyggolden .
That was a picture , I would remember something --
Verice Natale , in Tennessee , where I live , there was a 3.8 billion lights of a 3.8 billion lights .
You 've seen it on news .
This is the second biggest flust of last flow in America .
It 's happened around Natale .
The naliice of one of the fuel industry was this .
Video : I 'm going to do it .
It 's abundant here in America , and it 's going to grow our economy .
Frosty the fuel is more and clean .
It 's at good price , adorable and the work is keep the stypenon .
Al Gore : Froginia . It 's a lot of the West Virginia .
The biggest minerair society on the mountains is Massey Coat . This is his administrator .
Video : Don Blakenship : I 'm going to do -- Al Gore , Nancy Pelootherwise , Harry Reid -- they don 't know what they 're talking about .
Al Gore : So the Alleance for Protexture of the Clima has two campaign .
This is a thing , a part .
Video : ALt : Alla COALergy , we see climate change , as a serious minacting to our business .
So , our priority is investing a big amount of money in a bunch of money in a bunch of a publicitary amount of the coal .
Actually , coal is not sports .
We think it 's clean -- it 's also a good profuel .
So , not preventure of climate change .
Let me do it .
Video : Acore : Carbone , you 've heard a lot of talk about it .
So let 's make a lot of a turn into a structure at the avanuly ,
Straordinary ! The cars are a little rumor , but this is the sound of the fuel technology of coal .
The fuel consumption is between the main coal cause , but the remarkable technology , but the remarkable of fuel , but the technology of the whole thing you see changes everything .
Do a look at : this is the odiergain technology .
Al Gore : finally , the positive alternative , you know , the positive alternational security .
Video : Comment : America is in crisis ; the economy , the national security ,
The fix that connects : all our dependence from fossil fuel combustible , like coal fuel and oil imported .
Now , there 's a new , audace , a new , audace solution for the circuit .
Repower : 100 percent of clean energy , in 10 years .
A plan to put America to work , make sure , and make sure we , and help to stop the global warming .
Finally , a solution that is baster to solve our problems .
Repower . You know more .
Al Gore : This is the last one .
Video : How does it get energy to America .
One of the fastest ways of bring to the dependence from combustible that kills our planet .
So , the future is here . Very , a new energy network .
Nothing : Nowi investment for bits for ben retributs .
Narrator : Repower America . It 's time to be realists .
Al Gore : At old , old , you know , if you want to go fast , you go to fast .
If you want to go away , you go together . "
We have to go away , fast .
Thank you very much .
Last year at TED , I introduction at the LHC .
And I promise to get back to the way it works .
So here I 'm here . And for the ones that there were no , the LHC is the biggest scientific experiment ever ever there -- 27 kilometers of circuit .
His task is to return the conditions that were at less than a billion billion , from the beginning of the universe -- until 600 million times a second .
All that is just environment .
This is the machine in the Ginevra .
We do this little Big Bang Bang in the reflies .
This is what I work . It 's called ATLAS -- it 's large-foot and has a 22 foot .
This is a spectacular picture of ATLAS in building so you can see proportions .
Ten settember last year , we accesum the machine for the first time .
And this picture was taken by ATLAS .
It was because of immense festegegation in the control room .
It 's a picture of the first fashion that had done all the LHC , entering in collision , in collision , with a part of the LHC , and spread particles into the remarkable .
In other words , when we see that picture the 10 writing , we knew that the machine worked , which is a big witten .
I don 't know if it was this to do it , or that , when somebody went to Google and saw that the page was this .
That means we had a cultural impact beyond to the scientific .
About a week later , there was a problem with the machine , and I had to these brought here -- these fixed by-up .
These fixed 13,000 amps when the machine works at the massive of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power
Now , the technical technical will look at the fixed and say , " It 's not true . I 'm too subject . "
And they can do that because when they 're very coussiddects are coussiddects .
So , at least 271 degrees , at a temperature in the space between stars , these fixed can bring that current .
In one of the juntures of the most known magneti magneti magneti in the LHC , there was a defect of a fast phobrication .
So the file fixed slightly , and the 13,000 amps suddenly met a electrical resistance .
This was the result .
Now , this is even more impressive if you think that these magneti fish more than 20 tons , and that have been moving about 30 centimeters .
They 're slumers around 50 magneti .
We had to take them , what we did .
We restinated them and travel .
They 're now now now going to get all the sub-place place .
By the end of the LHC will be again ,
We 're going to access it , and we expect to get the data or the bunch or , and continue so our adventure to find out what the moron the moron that they make the universe .
Now , of course , in a certain way , these accidents return the dibate on the value of science and engineering ering in the value of science and engineering in the front of science and engineering it . It 's easy to confuture .
I think the fact that it 's so hard , the fact that I think it 's the value of things like LHC .
I 'd like to end with the words of a English scientist , Humphrey Davy , which , I imagine , in defense of inuseful experiments of his pupillo , his pupillo , his pupillo was Michael Faday , said , " Niest is so dangerous for progress of human mind how that the science science is definitive it 's not about the new monitroes , and that 's not a new monitrom . "
Thank you .
I want to start asking you to rethink about when , as a kids , played cookies .
As you can see how to reach them and take them , and take them and move , you know , and you know , you know , and you know , and you know , you know , and you know , and you know , and you know , and you know , and you know , you know , and you can actually get them and spacecrap and spacecrap relationship .
The space reasoning is deeply connected to the way we understand a lot of the world around us .
So , from the information usulatical use of our physical interaction with physical objects , together my Pats , and my collaborator Jeevan Kalanithi , I started asking , " And I started to ask , " And I started to ask me , " And when we use a computer , instead of having the only of the mouse , we could take it a desktop , we could take a scientist , which is a scientist , I started with hands ,
and sistly it up to our please ?
The question was so interesting that we decided to explore the answer , building the Siftable .
In a few words , a Siftable is a great interactive computer as a biscopit .
In a few words , a Siftable is a great interactive computer as a biscopit .
You can move them with your hand , can " see " between them , " You can see " between them , " and they have a screen and a wireless and a wireless .
But in fact , they 're physical objects , like the morning , you can just be a affiry .
The Siftable is the example of a new ecosystem tools to manipulate digital information .
And as they become more physical , consciousness , conscious of the other , and as they become more physical , consciousness , of the other way we can explore new and fun and fun and different styles of interaction .
I 'm going to start with some simple example .
This Siftable is configured to show video : if you put it in a direction , the video will stand it , the video , it 's going back .
These interactive rates are conscious of other .
If you face them , they 're interested in what they 're around .
If they 're surrounded , they can do it a little bit .
If they 're surrounded , they can do it a little bit .
They also have their movement and inclination .
We then realized that one of the interesting implications of the interaction was to use the common managed , for example , " we pay " a color like it was a liquid .
In this case , we have three Siftable configurate as a bunch of green and I can use them to the color in that central , where they mix .
and I can use them to be brought in the middle , where they mix .
If we can find too , we can put a little bit of place .
And I 'm also good possibility of apprentice , like language , the mathematics and games where people can try and things , and see the results are immediately .
I 'm now --
This is a Fibonacks that I do with a theater program .
Here we have a words that is in half of the Scarabeer and Boboble .
Pratically , at every wouldn 't get a letter at every Siftable , Pratically , at every Siftable , Pratically , at every Sifable , and as you know , and while you 're trying to understand a dictionary .
Then , after about 30 seconds remischieve , and you have a new set of reading and new possibility to try .
Thank you .
Here is the kids came to the jump to Media Lab , I did it in a way that I tried and I spend a video .
They liked a lot of them .
And one of the interesting things that kind of application is that not to give people a lot of education .
You just say , " Compon words , and they know exactly what to do .
Here , other people who try to do it .
This is our beta younger tester tester , there on the right .
It was just wanted to impild them .
They were only in the moroncles , for him .
Now , this is a application of a interactive carton .
We wanted to build a tool for the Lui of language is Felix .
It can put new characters in the scene , you know , and you know , and you know ,
It can put new characters in the scene , you know , and you know , and you know ,
Here 's , he 's doing it out .
Video : The sun is source .
David Merrill : Now she took a treat a hand-up treat .
Video : The arange is the hand-up .
Bel work ! Yeah !
So , the Siftable and you can make your characters --
Video : Bau !
-- inventing your story .
Video : Hello !
DM : It 's a final story with the open , and it can decide him how you do it .
DM : It 's a final story with the open , and it can decide him how you do it .
Video : Film , thin ,
DM : The last example I have the time to show you is a tool , I can do it is a recently , to samamp and execgut music .
is a tool , I 've got recent , to tramp and make music .
The Siftable here , based on the bottom , the bacteria .
Each one of these has four different variations , and you can choose what to use .
You can also put these sounds in a sequence from you can buy .
And I just show you just doing a " sound and a sequence . "
These are actually actually , you can control from the vivivivision , like the reverber and filter .
The one particular one , and then you put it up and then inclens up .
And then there are the general effects like time and volume , which is going to apply .
Let 's look at how it works .
Video : We 'll start putting a base in two Siftable sequence , we 're going to put it in a series , we add the other basic .
Now I 'm going to put a bottom .
Video : Now I add percussions --
Video : I 'm going to put the filter bacteria , so I can control the effect from the alive .
Video : I can see the whole sequence of the intersequence , by one side , or on the other side , or on the other side of it .
Video : I 'll give you the filter at the lowest filter to get more expression .
Video : I can recombine the sequence of the sequence .
So I don 't have to plan it before , but I can improve , make it over a little more cortex .
And now , finally , I can spend the whole sequence on the left is the Siftable on the left Siftable .
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is to build new interfaces and more and more sounds like our brain and body works .
And today , I had time to show you one of this path , and some chance we try to bring out of the lab .
The concept I want to put you is coming to this new generation of objects to interact with digital media , which will bring information in our world , we want to bring information in our world in the way we want .
Thank you very much .
I don 't see the hour with you .
I 'm a writer .
I 'm going to be books is my profession , but it 's more than that , of course .
It 's also love and the cine of my life .
And I don 't expect that it can change .
But , I said , something particular happened in my life and my career , which has been taken me to recently recently , that took me to report the whole work .
The particular thing is that I recently written this book , this whoever called " Mangia , Prega , " What , is the diversly from my books , for some reason used books , for some reason used to come out in the world and became a big , bestseller ,
And the result is that everywhere is , people treat me as if you were concerned .
It 's true -- conconvicted ,
They 're all doing me , I 'm doing it , and they say , " You don 't care of doing better ?
You don 't care of continuing to write the whole life without being able to create a book that can important to someone ? "
What can you care about somebody ? "
It 's certainly unsure , you know .
But it could go worse , at the end of the one remember that over 20 years ago , when I started to say to people -- I was a writing -- I wanted to be a writer .
I was going to put it up the same reaction based from fear .
And people said , " Don 't I couldn 't have success ?
You don 't care that the humiliation of the law killed you ?
You don 't care of doing this mestize for all life without anything about it comes and die on a mule of a dream of infrants with the mouth of the lobe to be handed to failure ? "
So , you know .
The answer to all these questions is , " Yes . "
You know , I 'm afraid of all those things .
I 've been fear .
And I also fear that I 'm also fear of the other things that people can 't inhit .
As the algains and other spent things .
But , as I 'm going to write what I thought and I 'd say last multily is why ?
Is it rational ?
It 's logical that anyone who has been expected by a job that was born to do .
But what is that in the creative impress that makes us nervous nervous and it 's about the other people in a way that other career don 't do ?
How my dad , for example , he was a chemist and not remember one once in his 40 years of activity that was asked if he was doing it was asked if he was doing it to be a little bit of engineer ?
It was never -- that blown up to engineer John , how does it go ?
It didn 't work like that , do it ?
Onestly , the chemistry engineers like group have no -- in the centuries , flied the reputation of being alcolized ,
We writers , we have enough this reputation , and not just writers , but creative of every kind , we have this reputation of being enormous .
And it 's not even though it 's the same conteddent deaths of magnificments that , only in the 21st century , they die young people and often die .
And the ones that are not suicians are really unabled by their dunges .
Nman Mailer , before I die , in the last interview said , " Every book , killed me a little more than a little more " a little more " a little bit more " an extraordinary affermonation about the work of their own life .
But we don 't buy it , when we heard these things so long that we 've been completely interiorized and accepted the notion that creativity and the notion that creativity and suffering are in some way of reading and the art , at the end , it 's always going to get the analysa .
And the question I want to take all of here today is : are you agreed with this idea ?
You know , this thing -- because it 's looking at a centimeter of a distance to me , it 's not good for this supposition .
I think it 's odious .
And I think it 's also dangerous and I don 't want to see perpetuated in the next century .
I think it 's better encourage our big creative minds .
And I know that , in my case -- in my case -- it would be very dangerous to start fuse to fix that I was supposed to be able to start fixing the circuit in which I 'm in my career .
Of course -- I 'm pretty young , I 'm pretty young , I have about 40 years .
I 've got about four decades of work in me .
And it 's a lot of likely that everything I 'm going to be right from the world like the work that came out after the world as the work that was used to happen to my last book .
I 'm going to slavt , because we are all over here -- it 's likely that my big success is my big .
Oh , Gesus , who thought !
You know , this is the kind of thought that leads a person to start to drink yourself in the nine of the morning and I don 't want to do it .
I 'm going to continue to do this work that we love .
So , the question becomes , like ?
And so I think , after a lot of reflective , which the way to work to continue to do is to create a psychological costruction , OK ?
I have to find a lot of security distance between me , I 'm writing , and my natural anxxiety about what I written is going to go and and , as I 'm trying to figure out how to start looking through time , and trying to find other society , trying to find other society to see if they could have better ideas and sane and more healthy and sane if they could have to have some of the best ideas and sane and sane and better and healthy and sane ideas and sane
How to help people creative creative inerent people to run the emotional risk .
And that research has taken me to the Great and ancient Great and ancient .
Seguitegen because I 'm giving in your circle and then go back .
In the ancient Grek and ancient Rome -- people don 't seem to believe that creativity came to men , OK ?
It was thought that creativity was this spirit , and they came to men from men from a few people distant and unknown , for a few distant source and unknown , for other distant and unknown .
The green creates these spiritues were called the demon creativity .
Socrate , wonderful , he believed to have a demon that 's wisdom ,
The Rohands were the same idea , but they called that " spirit species .
That 's great , because the Rohands didn 't really think that a genius was somebody who was particularly smart .
They thought that a genius was this kind of devine that was actually created in the walls of an artist , a little bit like the elpho Dobby , and that was like the elpho Dobby , and that was the job of the artist and models the result of the artist and models the result of that work .
Exxectional -- here is the distance of which I talk about -- that psychological construction that you protects you protects from the result of your work .
And they all knew that was how it worked , right ?
So the anti-artists were protected by certain things , like , for example , too much narcisixth , no ?
If your work was exceptional , you couldn 't take all the place , all of you know that you were helped by this incorporate genius .
If your failure , it wasn 't you all of your work , right ?
Everybody knew that was your genius to be a inable .
And so people han conceived creativity in Occcient for a long time .
Then the Rensessed and all changed it , and it was born this big idea ; we put the human being over the center of the universe over the universe , and the mysteries and without leave space creatures that writing out of divinity .
This was the principle of humanity rational humanity and people started thinking that creativity came out of the hydgen .
And for the first time in history , you start to referrate to this or that artist as a genius rather than a person with genius .
And I 'm going to tell you , I think it was a big mistake .
I think I let somebody do , a simple person to believe that is like a recipient as a recipient as a recipient , and the source and the source is a very big physical responsibility , and it 's a very big physical sical and so big physical and giving the human fragile .
It 's like to ask someone to enjoy the sun .
Deform and destaurable to be completely the ego and creates all these expectations on performance .
And I think it was this pressure that we have been in 500 years .
And , if that 's true , and I think it 's the question becomes , and now ?
Can we do that diversity ?
Maybe I 'll go back to a more antial understanding of human relationship between humans and creative mystery .
Or maybe not .
Maybe we can 't cell 500 years of rational thinking in a device of 18 minutes .
And there 's probably people in the audience that would be legitimate sospects on the notion of , you know , the people spend up with the people spending up next to their projects .
And I 'm probably not going to convince you all about this thing .
But the question I 'd like to bring is -- why not ?
Why don 't it think of this way ?
Because it has more sense of everything that has ever heard of the exasperant impredicbility of the creative process .
A process that , as anyone who ever tried to do something -- so so , it 's basically , you know , you know , it 's not rationally .
And , in fact , it can sometimes seem completely paranormed .
I did this meeting recently with the extraordinary poetry , who has now 90 years , but she was a poeter for all of life and said that during his sea in the rural Virginia , working out in the camps , and he felt it , inside the skies , and he felt it , in if a poem was the lesson .
He said that was like a fragageous tracy .
And he was rotoling towards her from the landscape .
He felt it , because he did just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just like that .
He knew that I had one thing to do at that point and was , words , " Would you like a match . "
And so he would correct her towards and she was sitting by this poem , and it would not have to get a piece of paper and a matit was pretty quickly , while the trapon , and it was page , and I 'm going to tell you about the page .
Sometimes he couldn 't be fast enough , so it was a little , and it would keep up and correcrecreceive and the rotolar and she was going to go through and she loved and she had to go through the landscape , trying to get rotating through the landscape , trying to say , " another poet . "
Then there were those times -- this piece I 'm never going to forget -- there were some of the moments where she was almost losing , OK ?
So , she was running home and she was trying to try and and the poem was going through , and she was going to go through , and then he said , and then he said , and then he was like if you go down with the other hand and steffed .
He was the poem from the coda and remained it in his body and transclued it on the page .
And in these cases , the poem would be presented on the page , and the last word to the last word .
So when I felt that I thought -- it 's very crazy , it 's exactly the same same thing .
Not all my creative process -- they 're not a construction .
I 'm a mulo , and my way to work is ; you know , I 'm going to see that horary every day and play and I 'm going to get up and go on on the goffly .
But even I , in my textbooks , I 've been brought to that , sometimes .
And I guess that many of you do it .
You know , even if the work and ideas came up with a certain source , I can 't honestly be willing .
And what is this thing ?
And how can we relate to it in a way that we don 't lose your head , but rather , what do it remain sis ?
For me , the best example , the best example I have is the musician I have is the musicist Tom Waits , which I interviews different years ago for a day .
We were talking about this , and you know , Tom , for the largest majority of life has been the incarnation of the injection of the injection of the initial impulses .
But then he invecent , I 'm going to get up , and a day while she was driving on a Los Angeles , changed all for him .
He was going to be fast and all of a tract , and it 's all this little framment of melodia , which is in his head as the inspiration , and the wants , and the wants , you know , it 's wonderful , and the desider , but it doesn 't know how to take it .
It 's not a piece of paper , he doesn 't have a matt register .
So I started to feel this old species of old old , " I 'm going to lose , and I 'm going to lose , and I 'm going to get obsessed by this song , and I 'm going to get obsessed by this song ,
I 'm not good enough and I can 't do it . "
And instead of going to go to the panic ,
He was going to do it , and he did something completely new .
And he just just look at the sky and said , " Scause , I 'm not driving that ? "
" You know , you know , " Would you write a song ?
If you really want to exists , you go back to a moment when I can take care of you .
Other , you know , you know , to importantly someone else today .
You know , to disturbing Leonard Cohen . "
And his process has worked changed after that .
Not the job , the job was still dark .
But the process , and the fish anxiety that was required when the genius , the genius was remained when the genius , the genius that was going to do it back from where , realized that it didn 't have to be a whole thing and remaize that was going to be a whole thing and return .
but I woote this peculiar collaboration , a conversation between Tom and this strange and the outside that was not Tom .
So , as I felt that story started to change a little bit of the way I worked and I was always saved and I 'm going to save .
This idea , I 'm writing , " Mangia , Prega , " and I got to be , " and fall in one of the disperation that we 're all working on something and we can 't start thinking that and start thinking that will be a disaster , which is the worst book that we 're doing the worst book .
Not just bad , right the worst book written .
And I started thinking about giving this project .
But then I remember the Tom I talked to the air and I tried to it .
So I got up on my face on the sleep and I 'm made my committed to a vacuum of the room .
And I said to get up , " Sest, what , you know , you know , if this book is not going to be brilliant , not going to be so much colame , no ?
Because I 'm putting all I 'm putting everything I have , I don 't have this .
So if you want to be better , you have to show up and do your part .
OK . But if you don 't do it , you know what , I don 't do it .
I 'm going to write the same because it 's my work .
And I 'd like to do my part of the recorded that I got to do my part , " Because -- finally , OK -- I 'm so , OK -- I 'm going to do in the desert Africa of the sacts and sacres and music and sacres and sacres and sacres and sacts that go on and up to the housness .
And they were always magnifeted , because the ballerins were fantastic .
But every while , rarely , something happened , and one of these artists became actually transcendent .
And I know you know what I 'm talking about , because you 've all seen , at a performance , a performance so .
It was like if the time , you stopped up through a kind of land-lead and she was doing nothing different from the solitor , like 1,000 night , but it was all wrote .
And suddenly , not just like a human .
But it 's accentioned from the divinity of divinity .
And when this was going to happen , the people knew what was , they called him .
They were going to start dog up , " Allah , Allah , Allah , Allah , God , " God , God , " God , "
That 's God , you know .
Curious note -- when the Matinvaders the southern of Spain , I was this habitude with them and the pronounced to the centuries , Allah , " to " Ole , " , " " " " " Ole , " , " " the " Ole , " , " which you can still feel in the courries .
In Spain , when a artist did something impossible and magic , " Allah , I was , I , I was , I , I was burned , I was good , I 'm going to be a last thing -- a last God .
And it 's great because we need .
But , the problem comes the day , after the dancer , and the dancer , when you wake up and discovering that are 11 in the morning of Martedesh and God is no longer .
It 's just a mortal mortal with gran bad leg , and maybe it 's never even more to get that altitude .
And maybe nobody will tell the name of God still as yra , and what do you have to do with the rest of his life ?
It 's hard .
This is one of the most pathful recognize to make in a creative life .
But maybe it doesn 't have to be so angoal if you can 't believe , as well , as well , as it 's as you can 't believe ,
But you would just think that you 're data in prested by a inimaginable source of this team of your life that you 've got to go to someone else when you finished .
And , you know , if we think it 's in this way .
And so I started thinking about , and it 's sure , and it 's sure that I thought for several months in the working on the book , which I 'm going to stop , the dangerous , spenty , I 'm going to go through my big success .
And what I have to continue to tell me when I feel electric .
It 's just not just your work .
Continua presentation of your part , any can be .
If your job is dance , ball .
If the divine , it 's assurd to you get a few kinds of wonderful , for one moment through your effort , for one moment through your effort , then " Ole ! "
You know , you do that same thing your dance .
And " Ole ! " You know .
I think , and I think I should teach it .
" Ole ! " at the same , even for having had human love and testoxtal textals from make a representing .
Thank you .
Thank you .
June Cohen : Ole !
You 've already talked about some of these projects on the genome , what it can mean and the discovery new set of genes .
We 're now starting a new path : we started to digitize biology and now we started to digital code we 're entering in a new phase of biology , design and design and synthetizing life .
We 've always been trying to bring big questions .
" What is the life ? " That 's something that many biologists have tried to understand vary vary var .
We tried different approaches , reduced to the minimum .
We 're digitizing from almost 20 years .
When we sequenced the human genome was treated to go from the analome of biology in the digital world .
Now we ask ourselves : can we regenerate life , or create new life from this digital universe ?
This is the map of a little organism , Mycoplasma genitalium , which is the smallest genome of the smallest genome that can authorem in the lab .
And we tried to reduce the genome to create a little bit more small .
We can get to get a hundred genes of genes about 500 that are here .
But when we look at his metabolic map , it 's relatively simple respect to our .
I think , that 's simple .
But when we look at all the genes that we can get , one at the time , it 's very unlikely that this can bring to a living cells .
So we decided that the only way to progrew was synthetize this chromosome of these fundamental questions .
And so we started the adventure of " Can Can we synthetize a chromosome ? "
Can the chemistry confeeling to produce these big molecules that we never could create before ?
And in case , we can make a chromosome ?
A chromosome is just a piece of inert material .
The speed with which we can digitize life is growing up to the exponential life is growing up .
Our ability to write genetic code , instead , progrecially , but it 's improving .
And our most recent results the recently revenues .
We started over 15 years ago .
The process process required a lot of steps , starting with a bioethical review before we started the experiments .
But we found that synthetize DNA is very difficult .
There are tens of thousands of cars in the world that make little segments of 30 to 50 leck , and it 's a degenerative process : the more the segment is longer , there are .
So we had to develop a new method for assembling these framments and correcrecreceive the mistakes .
And that was our first attempt , to particularly digital information of the genome of the Phi X 174 .
It 's a little virus that kills bacteria .
We 've been designed by the fragments , effectuated the correction of the mistakes and get a DNA molecule of about 5,000 lettes .
The interesting part is when we took this piece of inert material that is inert , and we put it in bacteria , the bacteria have started reading this genetic and produring the viral particles .
The viral particles have then been released by the cell , they went back and they destroyed the Eccles .
I talked about recent with the oil industry from oil industry saying that they 're certainly compressed to them that 's certainly compressed this model .
They have been remarkable than you .
We believe that this is a situation where software can really build his same hardware in a biological system .
But we wanted to do things in big .
We wanted to build the whole chromosome of bacteria .
They 're over 580 mile lettes .
So we thought we made it in the size of the virus , so that we can change the cassettle for the cassets of a living cells .
The design is crucial , and if we start with digital information in a computer , these must be very accurate .
When we sequence this genome was the first time in 1995 accurattainty was a mistake for every 10 mile .
We found it , we were resequence , 30 mistakes . If we had that original sequence never would be able to do it work .
One part of the process is design that we can make 50 letter that are very long , with all the other 50 letter to 50 letter up with all the other 50 lettlement to build subunit .
We can see unique elements here .
You probably read that we read that we put it in the fix .
Think about this : we have a genetic code on four letters : A , C , G and T.
Three of those letters , they put up up about 20 fright-amminoacks , and there 's a specific order to read for every friendly order to read .
So we can use the genetic code to write words , frasases , thinking .
What we did at the beginning is self-rethographed .
Some have been dollar by the fact that it wasn 't poem .
We 've been doing these segments to just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just
There are them that they repair them and put them up .
And we started assembling parts , starting with segments from five to seven mile , and it 's letter , unending them in a way to form a 24 mile letter , and they just put up to 72 mile .
And we made these segments in abundance , so we 've been trying to make a very robutting thing that we 're trying to create a very robustog -- as you 'll see in a minute .
We 're trying to authomatize the process .
So , this looks like the tabellon a boket .
When we get these very long , over 100 mile , the more than 100 mile , they will not grow more directly in E.
You get to the modern limits of modern biology .
So we looked at other mechanisms .
We knew about another mechanism called recombination omologist , which in biology is ulizing to repair the DNA to be able to repair the sements .
Here 's an example .
This organism , called Deinococcus radiodurans , can absorb three million radiation .
You can see in the suddener square as his chromosome .
In 12 -- 24 hours is replacplacement as it was before .
There are thousands of organisms that are able to do that .
These organisms can sit completely .
They can be in a vacuum .
They are absolutely certain that life exists in space , and you know , places that are song to find new riches of water .
ASA showed it that this is .
This is a picture of the molecule that we 've built using these processes , just using the design of learning with the design appropriate design of the opens .
The lights assemble .
This picture is not taken with a microscope , but with a microscope , but with a microscope .
It 's a molecule that we can see with a light microscope .
These are photos that cost a period of about six seconds .
This is the puzzle that we did a little time ago .
They 're over 580,000 lettes .
It 's the largest molecule of a definite structure that man .
It has a 300 million ,
If you stamp it with a 10 without spaces , you 'd like 142 page , it would like 142 page for a genetic code .
Now , how do we do it work ? How can we active it ?
Of course , you 're tramed to a virus is a game .
It 's a little bit more complicated when you use bacteria .
It 's simpler also when it 's the eucariote cell as our : you can just extract the nucleus and put another one , which is basically the process of clonation .
In bacteria , the bacteria is instead of integrated in the cell , but we 've just showed that we are able to do a complete trapiant chromosome of a cell cell from another and activity .
We clear a chromosome from a microbial species .
The two are different as men from the topes .
We added some genes in a way that we can decide what to do for this chromosome .
The skip and then sciolto kill all the proteins .
And when we put it in the cell was stupenci-- and you 'll open our sophisticatoomic graphic -- the new chromosome -- the new chromosome -- the new chromosome .
And we were actually thinking that we couldn 't go beyond , but we tried to get more in there .
This is one of the major mechanisms .
We found that a lot of species have added a second or a third chromosome , and I added in a second thousand new tracks that species .
So who thinks about evolution as a only gene , it has not really understand a lot of the biology .
There is some of the restriction called restriction restriction that I 'll tell you about DNA .
The chromosome that was in the cell not one .
The cell phone cell phone , which we have inserit-down .
You know , it 's expressed , and it recognized the other as the summit , has masticated it , and we 've been found with only the cell and the new chromosome .
It became blue because of the genes we put it .
And in a short leverversus , all the characteristics of a species , I 've got all loved in a new species , based on the new software that we 've inserted in the cell .
All the proteins have changed , and when we read the protein has changed , and when we read the genetic code .
Now , this may seem to be genetic , but altering DNA software , we can change the things in a substantial way .
Now , I 've already explained that it 's not about genesesis -- but it 's progress to three million years and a half million years , and I said that maybe we 're going to create a new version of Cambrian explosion of Cambrian explosion of this digital explosion .
Why do that ?
I think it 's pretty obvious when we think about our necessity .
We 're going to go from six billion and a half billion people in nine 40 years .
Right for example : I was born in 1946 .
Now there are three people on the planet for each existent in 1946 , there will be four .
We 're having problems now to find food , fresh and clean and a bitch , drug and a half billion and a half of people .
It 's still going to be able to do it for nine billion .
We use more than five billion billion fuel , more than 30 billion bulum , more than 30 billion baries .
That means hundred million baries a day .
When we try to find biological processes , or any kind of process to replacual them , it will be a huge challenge .
We have to keep the whole hemimixing of the whole emission of these materials that 's finished in the atmosphere .
At day , thank you to discoveries in the world , we have a database with about 20 million genes , and I like to think that are the design components for the future .
The electronics is only a dozen of components , and think about how many things came out .
Our limits here are data from the reality and our imagination .
Now we have now techniques , thank you very rapid synthetization , can create what we call fighting genomics .
We can build a big robot that can produce a million chromosome in chromosome .
Think of processing these 20 million genes or different genes or to try to optimize the processes to produce eight or drugs , new vaccines , we can change , thank you , thank it , and create more biology now that in the last 20 years .
And it 's just a standard selection .
We can choose for possibility of survival , chemical production or fuel , or production of vaccine ,
This is a instantaneous instantaneous software programmed that we 're working on to be able to make it and design species on the computer .
Well , we don 't necessarily know how it will be .
We know exactly how their genetic code .
We 're now focus on the fourth generation .
You also saw you that you can extract thanol from the grate was a bad experiment .
We have carburant than the third generation that will use enough to be sugar from the highest fuel than the highest fuel , as the eight-different kinds of butants .
But the only way that biology can have a big impact without increasing more than food and limitary the cost of food and limitary the ability would turn CO2 in matter before , where we 're working on to design cells that can reach that , and we think we can get this purpose , and think we can have the first fuel of the quarters in about 18 months .
The solar light solar with the CO2 is a metodo-- but in our discoveries , we found different metods .
This is a organism that we 've described in 1996 .
He lives in the ocean , at about 2,500 feet of the deep water for the temperature of water .
They create meter from CO2 using hydrogen molecular as a source of energy .
We 're trying to figure out if we can incanal CO2 , which can easily be transported through tubi tubi , convertire that can make this process .
So , a short think we could be able to increase what the basic question is what life is " We , versus , versus the idea of what life " is " We , versus the goal of replacement ,
Exactly . If you can 't do that from TED , where do you ?
It would become a main energy source .
And we 're also working for using the same metods to create vaccine vaccine .
You 've seen this year with flu , we always go back and a dollar in less when it 's the one dollar .
I think what you can change building vaccine combinable vaccine .
That 's how the future may start to look at , now , the tree of evolution , is to get the evolution with bacteria bacteria , I 'd hold cells , and finally , arches , and finally cell eucariote .
We 're so at the best people .
Our purpose is to do it . Thank you very much .
First of all of you , the most rapidly possible , some fundamental work , of the new technology that we brought to the Microsoft has been followed to a year ago . This is Seadragon .
It 's a local environment that you can interact is at local level that remote with a huge amount of visual data .
Here we 're seeing a lot of bottom of digital photos with a kind of zoom and continuous , for a sandandwild , and I have the images like we want to .
And it doesn 't matter how big information that we see , how big information that we see , as big , these things are big data or images .
Most of the digital photographs , but this is a scan from the Library of the Congress , and recently recently , and reenter in the gamel of 300 megapiel .
It doesn 't make any difference because the only thing that you know the prestations of a system like this is the number of pixel on your screen in any time . It 's also a very flexible architecture .
This is a whole book , for example , not data .
This is the Casa desolate Casa . Every colonna represented a capital .
To show you that 's just about it , and not images , we can do something like that , to really see that this is about a real representation of the textbooks , not a picture .
It could be a way a little artificial way to read a electronic book .
Not a advice .
This is a most realistic example . This is a number of the Loook .
Every picture is the beginning of a section .
And it really gives you the pleasure and the becomes to the version , the real version cartable , or a quotidate , which is for a molteplant , which is for a molteplug .
We also did something with the angle of this number in the Dog .
We created a higher puzzle resolutionable -- much higher than what you use in a normal advertising , and we put it in a minute .
If you want to see the characteristics of this automobile , you can see here .
Or other models , or even the techniques .
And this really shows some of these ideas to eliminate the limits of space on the screen .
We hope that that that means to put up the pop-up and other porcheries , and other porcheries , I didn 't have to be necessary .
Of course , the map is one of the most obvious applications for this kind of technology .
And I don 't want to lose time , if we don 't tell you that we have contribute to give you in this field .
These are all the streets in the U.S. subvil over a NASA geospace .
So now we go to something else .
This is actually the alive on the web ; you can go to see it .
This is a project called Photosynth , which combine two different technologies .
One is Seadragon and the other is a very interesting visual computer for Noah Snavely , a student of the University of Washington , with Steve Seitz Seitz Seitz Seitz Seitz Seitz Seader Seadragon . An Seadragon . " At Research . "
And it 's from the jobs , managon from Seadragon .
You can see when we do this kind of pattern , where we can go from a picture of the other and have this kind of experience to the other and have this kind of experience to solution .
But the space colump here has actually a meaningful meaningful .
The computer visualization has been taken together , in the computer , they recorded these images together , so that correspond to the real places that I imagine -- all of these things like -- all of you know , you know , the canadesize , and these things have been scatten . Here you can tell you see the elements of a slightly , and these things have been doing a destable , and these things have been doing .
I don 't know if I have time to show you some other environment .
There are a lot more space .
I want to go directly to one of the original set of Noah-- and this comes from a previous prototype of Photosynthroysynth that we 've done for the first time , I think of what 's really the key to think about is really the chemical key to the chemical website . And it 's not necessary that we put in the environments .
We had to do worry about legal aspects and on it .
This is a re-building re-building re-built images from Flickr . Basta digital digital Notre Dame , and you get pictures of the kinds of arms and you get pictures of the kinds of areas and said . Each one of these coni coni coni argants is to this model .
So , they 're all taken from Flickr and they 've been all connected to this way .
And it 's possible to be able to be very simplly .
You know , I would never thought I would end up to work for Microsoft .
It 's very gratifying to get this kind of acaachievement here .
I think you can see that it 's a lot of different kinds of photos , from the ones of those cell phones to the SLR , a number meaningful number of meaningful settle , put together in this environment .
And if I can , I try to try and find out of the most strange .
A lot of them are stuck by faces , etc .
Somewhere there is a series of photographs -- there .
This is a Nototo poster , Dame correctly .
We can go from the poster to the physics of this environment .
The essential point is that we can do things with social environment . This is now taking data from the whole memory of the whole memory of how it looks like the land , from the sign , from the visual point of view -- and connected to all those data .
All those pictures become connected together , the biggest of the supplies .
You have a model of land that emerged .
Think about this as a prolungation of Stephen Lawler on Earth 's virtual Earth .
It 's something that grows in complexity , as people use it , and the which you advantages to get the use .
Their pictures are married with inseries .
If you can someone comes the idea of contrast to be all of these things like , I can see the name of Nototter Dimprovised by Notre Dame suddenly required to all those data , and I can use how to immergerms to the space , in that metapuniverse , and having a type of a kind of a cross-motion experience and have a kind of a cross-moke .
Of course , a consequence of all of that are virtual models , of course , every interesting part of the earth , collected not just seen it up to be plane and similar images and similar images and similar images and similar imagination .
Thank you .
Chris Anderson : I can understand ? What your software is going to take us to do is that at a certain point , in the next years , all of the photographs are going to share anyone in the whole world will be practical together ?
BAA : Yeah . What 's doing is doing is actually discovered .
It 's creating hyperlink , if you want to , in images .
And it 's doing it in the bottom of images .
The thing becomes very interesting if you think about wealth of semantics information that many of these images possible .
As you do a research on the web , you have a phrase and the textbooks on the web has a lot of information about the pictures .
Now , what happens if you 're playing all your photos ?
So the amount of semantics and the amount of wealth is really enormous . It 's really enormous classic effect of the network .
CA : Blaise , it 's really incredible . It 's very amazing .
BAA : I thank you very much .
One of the pleasure pleasure when you travel and one of the search search is that we can live in who has not forgotten the antial traditions , between who has no antial traditions , the stone on the wind , the wind the stone of the plants .
Bastes think that the sciamans Jaguar travel still beyond the Via Lattea , or that the monitites Inuit are still in Himalayas , the budddists still the respire of Dharmful , but to remember the most anthropology , and the idea that the anthropology , and the idea that the anthropology , but it 's just a model , but it 's just a model , but it 's just a model ,
the consequence of a particular set of adaptative choices that our estrpe has done , well , many generations ago .
And , of course , we share the essential tracts .
We all proof it . We all promise .
We 're subjects to start .
We have to death the inexorability of death , so we don 't surprising if we can 't sit -- if we can 't sit --
We all have a art .
What it is the particular rhythm of the song , the rhythm of every culture .
It doesn 't matter that the Penan IT forests , or the following Vodoo or the Air 's driving , or the desert Kenya , or the desert Kenya , or a deserrial cammits , the Curander 's Curander .
He was my journey of journey in the desert a month ago , or a higher , in the yak of Qomolan , on the waste of the world 's mother .
All of these people teachers teachers that are other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , other ways of moving in the world .
And , if you think , a moment , it 's a concept that can give you hope .
Insilly , the myriades of the world create a ragnote of spiritual life and is important for the beneath and it 's important for the bend to the planet and it 's important for the beneath of the planet as biosphere .
And you can think about this cultural ragnosphere and you can call the etnosphere and you can call the etnosphere is the sum of all the concepts , dreams , ideas , intuitions , intuitiitions , intuitions , intuitions ,
The etnosphere is the fantastic patriage of humanity .
It 's the symbol of what we are and what we can be in how inquisitive species .
And because it was a gravly consumed as it has been as a as it happened to the etnosphere and unfortunately .
Nobody biological , for example , it would say that 50 percent of all species is on the orlo of the extinction just because it 's fake , or -- in the most apocalm -- in the arest of biological diversity -- and not even even neat at the local issues -- that the of cultural diversity .
The index of that is , of course , the language persites .
When you were born 6,000 languages on this planet .
A language is not just a vocabulary or a series of rules , or a series of rules .
A language is the spacecrax of human spirit .
It 's the middle of which the animal is coming in the material world .
Every language is a forest , a backin , a backin , a thinking , a ecosystem of spiritual possibility .
And of those 6,000 languages , as we are here in Monterey , at least half the half of the hasn 't even more suit in the ears of children .
They 're not teaching kids , the people who want to say , at least that 's not not something , which is already death .
What is the most sad of being availed from the silence , of being the last talk , of being the last talk , of the language , of the people don 't have a way to put the wisdom of the kids ?
This is a state of somebody in the world , in some of the world every two weeks : every two weeks a old body , a couple of weeks , a old silabs and door and door and door a language .
And I know that somebody 's 's going to say , " It 's not better ?
The world would not be a better place if we talk about all the same language ? " Well , then let 's talk about yoruba . Let 's talk dottonna .
Let 's talk about kogs .
You 'll see a sudden thing that is not to talk about your language .
I 'd like to do a journey through the etnosphere --
a little journey in the etnosphere for you a assage of what we 're losing .
Many of us forget that when I say , " different ways of exists , " intentirely different ways of exists .
We take for example this Barasana Barasana , in Amazonia , the popular people of anaconda , which crede the myth of provide from sacond saconest in the west sacres of seacres in sacres .
It 's about a popular popular that 's not able to distinguess the blue color from the versus , because you 're identified in the forest , which depends on the popular .
They have a strange language and a matrimonial rule , called " exogamia " " " You have to marriage a different language .
All of that has radical past mitological past , but the particularly is that in these families in these families in the summary families , in which you talk to six or seven languages ,
They 're just just just listening and then they start talking .
We take one of the most interesting tribe with which I lived , the Waorani of Ecuador north , an incredible popular popular people who had the first contact in 1958 .
In 1957 , five missionaries have been trying to make a mistake .
They did taken out of photographs that they were reached that in a gave that they had been reported , forget that this popular people had never seen anything bi-dimensional forest .
They collected the picture from the earth , they spread a shape or a shape and , not found anything , they 'd concluded that it was the hell , and they were killed the five missionaries with lance .
But the Waorani doesn 't kill the soul .
They killed them between them .
54 percent of the mortality was caused by their own .
We 've been eight generations and we found two of natural death and we found two natural death and when we insist to know , they love that they had been aged so that it was invecent , and then they killed it , and then they killed it .
The animal crubbing animal kets , and recognize the species .
In the early ' 80 , I had been assigned a task , and I was a task when my Harvard 's professor I wanted to go to Haiti to sweat , and I 'm going to get to Haiti to the base of Duvalier and Tonton Macoutes and I got to get my velon .
For a sense of miracologist , I should have to understand Vodoo culture . And that Vodoo is not magic .
It 's a pretty much of a complex , metapphysics of the world .
A lot of interesting .
If I asked you to tell you the big religions of the world , what do you do ?
Cristianism , Islam , Buddhism , Ebraism , etc .
A continent is always left out , thinking that Africa has no religious feds of religious feds . And instead of religious things . And instead of the Vodoo is not the other that the distilside of these religious concepts in the tragic tragic housing .
What 's interesting about voodoo is the intended in life and death .
So the jump they hidden the spirits .
The spirits can invoced by the Grande Acqua , they resonate the rhythm of the dance and the temporary of the vial way that for a short time , the follows becomes the goal .
So , for that voodooists like " You white you go to talk about God .
We slow it to be in the temple and say God . "
And from the moment you 're married , is the spirit that you drive to be warm ?
So you 'd see these incredible events : follow voodoo in the state of trance that touch impunts are unusual demonstration of the power of the body mind when it 's catalized in a state of extreme in a state of extreme , but it 's a remarkable to extreme .
I lived all the popular that I lived the most extraordinary of Sierra Nevada Santa Marta Marta , in Santa Marta , in the Santa Marta Marta , in the Santa Marta Marta Marta , in the Santa Marta Marta , in the Santa Marta Marta , in the Santa Marta Marta , in the Santa Marta Marta , in the Santa Marta Marta Marta Marta , , in Santa Marta Marta Marta Marta Marta Marta Marta Marta Marta Marta
Indidiscending of the ancient advanticy that once had been living on the caraibial plants of the Colombia , the popular of the Colombia , the popular massive plants that are on the charaibits .
In a drug , a drug continent , this popular is never been conquisted by the way .
But it 's now now now , they 're government from a clero , but their formation is so extraordinary .
The young people follows are taken out of the families to three or four years , and live sat at a world 's made of buy and homber in a world 's made of a bottom of the glacier for 18 years .
Two periods of nine years choices to reproduce the nine months of the running nine months of the user 's utterer of the mother , now are metaphor .
For all that time , they 're acculturate to the values of their society , values that predict that their play and only their prayers can make the cosmic balance -- or to say the ecological balance .
At term of this incredible initiation , they 're suddenly landed out and for the first time in their age , at 18 years , see a housness . And in that consciousness of the first bore , when the sun is the valley values of beautiful landscape , everything that has learned in theory . The first thing is that they 've learned in theory . The first thing is going back and says , and it does a pass a pass .
" I 'm going to say , " I said ,
It 's amazing . It 's now you protect it . "
They call it greater brothers and say that we , brothers , brothers , we are the collipevolution of the world .
This level of intuition is extremely important .
When we think about the populations and the environment and the environment of the Rousau and the old story of wild , which is a razoom , which is a razoom in in his simplicity , we say that these people are closest to the Earth .
The popular ingenes are not not no feeling .
There 's no space for these things in the Asmallat or the winddat , but thank you and the rates , but thank you and the rates , they created a mistic Earth 's based 't the concept of it , but on a concept of the Earth can only live because it 's infected by knowledge , but on a whole thing that the Earth can only live because it is infected with the sciousness .
What does that mean ?
It 's got to say that a boy boy of Ande who is going to grow up the mountains is a spirit of Apu that will be a destiny different and will report a depth a different relationship with the mountains or that place to a boy of Montana who has been created by a mass-rock 's boy of rock ready to be a lot of rocks .
That 's the dimora of a spirit or a mineral cutting , is irrelevant .
What 's interesting is the metaphor that define the relationship between individual world .
I grew up in the forests of the British Columbia believed that the forests to be cut .
That has made me a human being different from my friends Kwautl that the forests are the forests of Hukuk and the ball of the paradise and the ball of the paradise and the spiritual of the world , we 're living in the northern world , spiritual ,
If you start to look at that these cultures can create realities , you can start to understand some their sensional feeling . We take this plant .
I 've been taken this april in the nordocction .
Mayahuasca , the most powerful , the most powerful psychotive , the most powerful psychotive psychotive .
What makes it fascinating the ayahuasca is not the potential of the substance , but his election . It 's composition is a very much , but his elaboration . It 's composition .
On one side , this lian law that has a series of beta-carboline , harmful and harmful , a slightly hole and harmful , slightly .
Take the only plants has a blumb that altera little bit of consciousness , but it 's measured with the leaves of a coffee of the coffee , and he said Psychotric .
This plant has been a lot of powerful triptamine , very similar to the serotonin , dimethoxtamine-5 , methoxtamine .
If you 'll ever see Yanomami , you 'll just just pull up on the nose of species , he 's actually a different set of species , he 's actually contains methoxtamine .
Tiring that polust for the hidden is a little like being sparked from a fugee of dipinboard dies and land on a sea of electricity . [ Risated not believe a distorsion of reality ; it creates the reality . It creates the reality of the reality .
I was often a lot of my professor , Richard Evan Shultes , the man who has been psychedelical , with his discovery , with his discoveries of the fungi , with his discoveries of the fungus in the 1930s in Mexico .
I think my textesis , you can 't use these triptamine as you can 't tell anybody to be hallucinated .
It 's possible to be just if you get to the other than than the chiemicals that denize out of the MAO .
Now , the beautiful carboline , that 's the beta-co-cool , and it 's the same kind of necessary to potential the samine inals . The question surprising triptamines . The question of spontaneous species , like these people who do have to find out of 80,000 species , like these people who have been in this lighting , and they create a very harmful version of several parts ?
We use the great eususususuper and the mistake , which can reveal infrumptive .
But if we ask the Indians , they 'll tell " The plants will talk about it . "
What does that mean ?
This tribes , the Cofan , has 17 variety of ayahuasks , which is narely in the forest , and that our eyes would go into the forest .
If you ask them , how they 'll stbilishing their tassonomes will tell us , " I realize that I was plants , you know , " I have said , " No . "
The solution is : you take the 17 variety of a lunch and each one will sunch with a different tone .
With this doesn 't have a laurea Harvard , but it 's a lot more interesting that you can count the stones .
Now , [ applausufacturing the problem is that the ones of us who have to heart popular people find them peittoresces , but in some way reducts to our real world , and pass .
In fact , the X-century , it 's not going to remembered for his drives or innovations , but rather as the thing that we were stopped and have active active and acactive actively accepted and cultural mass of diversity and cultural diversity and cultural mass of biological diversity and cultural change of the planet .
All cultures through the centuries have been involved in a dance for new possibility of life .
And the problem is not technology .
The Indians Sioux not to be Sioux when they put up to the arch and they received as a bunch of being American and they don 't have stopopped to be American and calute .
It 's not the change or technology that threaten the integrity of the etnosphere . It 's the power .
The last flight flight .
And if you give a look at the world , you 'll find that these are not destinated cultures .
They are living and spints are spinct out of the existence to the hyperperformable to be beyond .
I know , I 'm doing this in the patria pathria ,
a popular nobble , in the waste soul , a popular popular , a popular popular , and it 's now reduced in the forest to a generation ago , and now reduced to the servitor re-souls , where you can see the river in the waste that seems to take the inquinese sitting on Mar Cinese Merian , where the nitt Merial , where the Japanese Merial Cinese , where the Japanese ,
Wote to fit up the wooden sticks with the forest .
Or , in the case of Yanomami , are the disease that have come with the discovery .
If we move to the mountains of Tibet , where I 'm doing a lot of research , you 'll see the hard hard hard of political domination .
As you 'll know the genocide , the physics of a popular popular , is conviction at universal level , but the woocide , the destruction of life of a popular life , not only is convicted , but it 's just just not concerts , but it 's just a bird of development .
And you can 't understand the suffering of Tibet until you 're part of the beginning .
I 've been over 6,000 miles from Chengdu in Chengdu through Tibet sudden , coming to Lhasa young college , and I got to Lhasa young college , but only came to Lhasa , I realized what 's behind the statistics we feel about .
6,000 sacres reducts in dust and hit .
1..2 million people killed by military in the Cultural Rivolution .
The dad of this guy was ascritical at Panchen Lama .
That 's the Chinese invasion .
Humo the uncle was at Santity in Santity , in the diaspora that has taken popular in Nepal .
His mother was imprigioned and his colame was rich .
It was brought to the age two years from the age of two years hidden hidden under his gonna .
The sister , which has done the same , it was mit in reeducation .
A day , he had a waste fascinating a coffigurant fascinating Mao and , for this transgression , it was mit to seven years .
The Tibet 's pain of Tibet can be unable , but the spirit recently is from tener .
At the end , all of it is reduces a choice .
We want to live in the world world 's pollution or we want to accover the world pollution ?
The big anthropologist , first of death said that his biggest fear was that , in our way to go to this view of the world , not only we 'll see the whole gamord of human imagination reduced to a limitate modality of thinking , but a day we 'll see that there were other possibility .
And it 's umillion people remember that our species is exists for 600,000 years .
The Neolitics Rivolution , who gave us the agriculture , which has been made us subject to the seeds of the seeds , and it 's a poem of the mong with the prosa of the clay , and we talk about 10,000 years ago .
The modern world industry has 300 years .
That 's the story I didn 't suggests that we have the answers to all the challenge that we should do in the millennia to come .
When to these myriades of the world is asked what it means to be human , they resonate with 10,000 different voices .
And it 's in these answers that we all have the chance to be what we are : a consciousness , which has to make the popular people and all the gardens can fix . And there are great moments .
I 've been taken this picture on the northerthern extremity of Baffin the island , when I went to the jump with Inuit , and this man , Olaya , and this man , Olaya , and he told me the wonderful story of his grandfather .
The downnice is not always given with the Inuit and the 1950s to stbilish our suprematia , we have to get them in colonies .
The grandfather of this man refuted to go .
The family , I teming her life , took him all the time , and all his hots .
You 've got to know that Inuit doesn 't temon the cold , they exploit .
The pattins of slitters in the origin were made of pain .
The grandfather of this man didn 't have been standing from the night or from the library or from the library that was suffering .
It 's sgattle , it was sweet the pantalone in the focal skin and defecated in your hand . When I I did it , I got them up , it worked a teenaged .
He sprubbed on the points of this hell , and when it became solid , he killed a dog .
He took the dog and created a brighter , with the cass made a sleep , he made a sleep , he made a sleep , and it 's gone on the bunch , and it 's gone on the remain .
We want to talk about havarsely with nothing ? [ Risate . ] And this , in different ways , [ Applausuule is the symbol of the popular Inuit and all the popular people in the world .
In the april of the English government reddate of a biggest territory of a biggest territory of a biggest territory of the world 's biggest territory and Texas mitted together .
It 's the new patria . It 's called Nunut .
It 's a independent territory . They all the resources .
One splendid example of how a natione-state can recognize with the popular .
And I think , as obvious , I think it 's pretty obvious at the seems to be in these remote song on the planet , realize that they 're not remote .
For somebody is home .
They represent sextions of human imagination that are raised at the dress of these kids , like the dreams of these kids , like dreams of these kids , become part of the hope .
First , we know , National Geographic is convinced that politicians will never come to nothing .
We believe the polemies --
[ Applausi are not persuasive , but we believe that the stories can change the world , and maybe we 're the best institution to tell the stories of the world . Every month is to tell the stories of the world . ]
156 countries transports our television canal dog .
Our rists are thllled by millions of people .
Our work is traveling in the etnosphere to bring our audience in places that will go out and cultural and the hope , they 've got to be able to , and you 'll habit , they will sabled to the central reveal , the world will exists in diversity , and we have to find a life in a plural world of life , and multicultural and multicultural world 's life in a pluralistic and multicultural reveal ,
where the wisdom of all the populations can contributing to our collective well-being collective well-being .
Thank you .
I 'm going to talk about some things that I wrote in this book that I hope you 've heard and I 'm going to try to show some connections , in the case not notice .
I want to start with what I call the dogma official official .
The official dogma official thing ?
The official dogma official dogma western society 's the official dogma official : " If we want to massive the well-being of our citizens " " " " " The way to do it is to massive freedom individual liberty . "
The reason is , from one side , in fact that liberty is in itself , it 's a value , is pretious , it 's useful , it 's essential for human beings .
On the other is that if we are free , each of us can act for the same thing that is our well-being , without no one that we decide .
The way of massive to massive freedom is massive choice .
Other choices are , more libites , and the greater is their beneath , the largest is their beneath .
This , I think , is so depth radicated in society that nobody would dream that nobody would dream that you would put it in doubt .
And it 's also druiced in our lives .
I 'll show you some examples of what progress has made possible .
This is my super-market . It 's not particularly big .
I lose a simple note on the conditions for injury .
In my supermarket , there are 175 conditions , without contact 10 variety of extravergin and 12 acets , which you can buy for a huge number of conditions in the incbreaker that you can buy a huge number of conditional conditionment that nobody of 175 ready to ready to be a huge number of conditional ,
Here 's how the super-market .
Then you go to the electronics to buy a stereo : you , in CD , radio , radio , piaright , the light , the race , the light .
And in this single electronic store , there 's a big number of audio components .
We can do six and a half million different combinations using the components that there are in a store .
You have to admit that 's a lot of choice .
Other fields : the world of communications .
Once , when I was a child , you could get all the dest services , at the pitch that they were fornitable by Mom Bell .
You had the phone , you didn 't buy it .
A consequence of that , the next telephone was that the telephone never made .
These days are gone .
We have a lot of telephones , especially between cell phones , especially between cell phones .
Here 's the cell phones .
My favorite is that in the middle , Lake , cut out of the nose , and I 'm sitting in the middle of the brulk .
If you don 't have the store in the store under the house , you 're just going to come to it .
And what happens is that people come to the stopptie and does this question . And you know what the answer is , " No . "
It 's not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn 't do too much .
So , in other things that are much more important than the acquirts of the acquirts , you know , the same thing is explosion of choices .
Axxtopoptioning : no more in the United States that you go from the doctor and the doctor you have to do .
Instead , I go to the doctor , and the doctor says , " OK , we could do A , or B , " A , " A has these benefits and these answers . What do you want to do ? "
You say , " Dotore , what should I do ? "
And the doctor says , " A has these benefits and these risks , and B has these benefits and these risks . "
" What do you want to do ? "
And you rebits : " Dotore if she was me , what would you do ? "
And the doctor : " But I 'm not . "
The result of the result of the malate authonomed , which is the expensive .
But it 's actually not one that is a fishing and responsibility to make decisions from somebody who knows something , which is the doctor , to someone else knows -- and almost certainly unknown -- and so it 's not about -- and so it 's not about -- and so much in the condition to make the patient decisions .
There 's a huge marketing products , you know , it 's a huge marketing , you know , that if you think about not that , it 's not a sense , because we can 't buy them .
But if we can 't buy them , why do you ?
The answer is that they want to domesting it .
Something that is our identity is our horns is a question of choice , as you see in this jail . " We don 't want to provide kids . Scease their sex at at the time . " We don 't know more an identity : we need to invent .
And we can reinvent ourselves how many times we do it .
That means that every morning , at the risk , you have to decide that kind of person you want to be .
I 'm going to get family and marriage , a time the common perspective , it was almost for anyone , it was that there was the most soon possible , and it was that it was that you could , and it started to make the sixt .
The only real choice was with who , not when , and it 's not when , and it 's even what do after .
Ose it 's really to play .
I teach students very smart , and I do 20 percent in less than than a time .
And not because they are not so brilliant , not because they are less .
but why I 'm impensive , I mean , I 'm going to tell you , " Would I get to do that now ? "
" Would I tell myself later ? "
They 're a lot of logative .
And they try to answer these questions , even if this implic is not to be able to be able to do that check and not get a bel vote to my exame .
And they really have to do that . They 're important .
Now , the job : we are lucky , like Carl , because technology allows us to work every minute , every day , from every day , from every day , from every day , on the Hotel Randolph .
I 'm talking about , there 's a angle , and I 'm not going to tell anyone , where the WiFi works .
I don 't tell you , because I want to use it .
What does this mean , this amazing freedom of choice that we have to work ? It 's really to decide , continuously , if we have to work or not .
We can go to see our son playing hot , with the mobile phone , the Blackberry in the other , and the notebook , typically , and the notebook , typically , on the glasses .
And even if I 'm all spent , every minute that we see our son son son , we 're also asking this called ? "
" Did I answer to this email ? "
And even when the answer is " no , all this makes the experience of your son 's game of your son 's game , it 's going to be in other conditions .
So , from any part , we look at , little little , and big things , materials and life is a question of choice .
Once the world was this : Ovable , there were some possibility , but it was not a question of choice .
The world of today is : The dilemma is : " Is it a positive thing , or negative ? "
The answer is Same : The answer is Same .
The positive laten , we know , so I 'll talk about the negative latory .
All this choice is two effects of the things two actually negative effects on people .
The first , paradoxually , is that it produced paralysis that it 's going to be liberation .
With so many options between which choose , it becomes very difficult to do it .
I give you an example : a conduct for a flight on plan .
A colleague has had access to the data of Vanheald , the giant source society , with about a million clients in 2,000 different companies .
What she was discovered is that for every 10 solutions that are offered in the most , percentage of a bunch scenes of two percent .
With 50 offer source , there 's 10 percent in less than adhhesions than when they are available .
Because with 50 sourds between which chooses , is maledly difficult to decide , and choice is a hard time .
And I still ask tomorrow , and I still ask , tomorrow , and of course , I 'm never going to come .
You know , it doesn 't just mean that these work from old work to be healthy food for the canoes , because they don 't want to say that the decision is so obstical that allows the complementary source of work .
I don 't participating , they 're losing until five to a year from the work , which would be well be a work-deal .
So the paralysis a consequence of having too many choices .
And I think it makes the world like that .
" And finish , for eeternity : ketchup , send , or maionese or ? "
You would just take the right decision , if it 's for ethernity , right ?
You don 't want to choose the wrong , and you know the wrong condition .
So that 's the first effect . The second is that we can avoid the paralisis and do a choice , we 're less sub-sidized by the result of the result of what we would be with less options between which chooses .
And that 's this for different reasons .
One of these is that with many condition , as you can choose , if you buy one and it 's not perfect , it 's easy to imagine that you could do a different choice that would be better . And what happens is that the alternative . And what happens is that the alternative , and the force it is that the alternative of choice , and reply it deminumped by decision ,
And when it was a good decision .
Over choices , you know , the more easy to disliert than any detail that 's insodation-choice .
And also , there 's what economists call expensive .
Dan Gilbert has clear a lot of stamattine as we value to things depends on what we confronted .
Oel rest , when there are so many options , is easy to represent the features of alternative artment and be less soddisfacts of the option that you have to be choice .
Here 's an example . I 've been schooling with all the ones that are not New York .
But that 's what you 'd probably think .
There 's this copy in Hamptons .
A place of lussized .
It 's all about splendida . It 's all for them .
Not just miss . But what he thinks is , " Well , the reason , I 'm . "
" All my neighbors in Manhattan is . "
" I could talk about it right at home . "
And it 's going to go to two weeks , I can see -- every day -- every day -- the possibility of parking where it wants .
The expense opportunity deminule is the sub-opportunity for what we have , even when choice is the choice is a cell .
And the other people that we have to look at , the more the features will be remarkable to the expensive as the opportunity .
Here 's another example .
This is a lot of things .
It 's about living the moment , and maybe living slowly .
But the most important point is that you choose , you know , you know , you know , you know ,
The things that we don 't choose to be so many attractive that can make less attractive , what we do .
Third point : spiral growing of expectations .
I tried it on my skin buying a new couple of jeans .
I 'm just jewy-always jeans .
Once the jeans were just like , buy and bespecially , they were unknown , and they were unknown , just after you had a life and work and work , and they were all about a lot of times , they started going to go good .
So , I went to buy a couple of a new when the old old were going , and I said , " I need a couple of jeans , this is my cut . "
The committer said , " You want to be the slim , and the fit , absolutely , absolutely , absolutely , absolutely , absolutely , absolutely , absolutely , absolutely , relaxed me ? "
You want to do it with the cerniera or " Stonebottles ? " Stoneboy , " or " acidlave ? "
" Do you want to be layered ? "
" Sotto them or stretch ? Bla bla bla -- " Continured to get it .
I was sbalance , and after a little little bit , I could say , " I want the kind of -- that was the only guy -- that was the only guy , " It 's not what , so for a time I tried to all jeans , and then I got out of the store , I 'm going to get up to the best jeans that I had ever .
It was the massive . With all that I had the best .
But I felt I was worse .
Why ? I wrote a whole book for understanding it .
The reason I was worse for the worse is that with all that choice was very high , the jeans had to be perfect .
I was at the beginning . I didn 't expect that I was just like , but I was just one guy , but when I saw 100 different steps , at least one kind of have to be perfect .
What I had been buried , but not perfect .
After I had a chot with what I was trying to do is in confronted to expectations .
The added options in life not does not do that increase the expectations that these are respecting to the options of the options that are .
And that 's going to try less submit , even when the results are good .
Nobody in the marketing world , if you realize .
Because if they knew it , you would not know what I 'm talking about .
The truth is more like that .
" You were better when she was worse to the reason it was better when she was worse was worse is that when she was worse was still possible meet that was still possible meeting of the surprised .
Ost , in the world that we live in -- opulent , industrialized citizens with expectancy of the performation -- the massive that we can hope is that things are things to the expectations .
You never have a surprised pleasant because your expectations , my expectations , my expectations , I 'm ungant .
The secret of happiness -- what you 're here -- is , " Baxis expectations . "
I mean , little high-biographic -- that I 'm really married and my wife is really amazing .
I couldn 't do it .
But it 's not always a bad thing .
Finally , a consequence of buy jeans when there is just that kind of jeans is that when you 're not satisssatisfacts is that when you 're not sationononononto you know , " Why ? "
" Who is responsible ? " " , the answer is clear .
The world is the responsible . What can I do ?
When there are hundreds of kinds of jeans , and buy a insoddisfacing , and you ask who is the responsible , is the clear , it 's the clear , it 's the clear , you .
You could do better .
With hundreds of variety of variety of varieties , there are no use for the insuccess .
So when people take decisions , even if the result is the result is willing , you feel unlike , and they do the colame to their own itself .
In the last few years , the depression is explosion in industry .
I think a meant factor -- not the only one , but important -- of this honent honent , is that people have dollar experiences because standard are too high .
And when they have to explain this situation think that the colame is they .
So the final result is that we are better , objectively , but we feel worse .
Let me remember you remember .
This is the official dogma , what we all take for good and it 's completely fake .
There 's no doubt that a little choice is better that I don 't have any good , but it 's not going to be a little bit of choice is better than a little bit .
There 's a critical value , I don 't know what it is .
But I 'm sure that we 've been supposed to a piece the level that we have been doing our life .
Now , from the political point of view -- I almost finished -- from the political point , the noction is the followest .
What allows this together in industrial society is the material rechemistry .
There are many places in the world , and you know , where the problem is not that they have to be too much choice .
The problem is that they have too poked .
So the factory I 'm talking about is a malbeing exclusive , recipe of modern society , Western society .
And what it does to depress and climber is this : Steve Levitt . He talked about yesterday of those expensive and discoveries and the ways of the weird ,
I mean that these choices , complicated and available , is not that they 're just inuseful .
They 're just a dollar of it .
They do it stay worse .
If a little bit of what in our society allows so they were reversed in those where people have too few possibilities , it would not just have their life to improve but our life .
This is what economists call a paretian improvement improvement .
A redistributtion is good at all -- not just to the poor -- because of this choice in excess that we go back .
To conclude , " You can become everything you want to do --
You , people , you 'll think , " But what does it create that fish ? "
" That 's obvious that you can 't make anything in a glass . "
" A recastrated vision , a limited vision of the world --
and I 've been interested in the beginning .
But then , I think , instead , I realized that that the fish knows the long knows .
Because the reality of the fact is that if you 're sandwilling to the box , in a way that 's possible , " you can 't get the freedom .
If you break the box in a way that everything is possible diminugly deminule .
You can get the paralysis , and you 'll reduce the well-being .
Everybody needs a sphere .
This is almost certainly too close , maybe even for the fish , and it 's sure for us .
But the absolutely sphere is a recipe for infeless and , I 'm going to be a recipe for the ruin .
Thank you very much .
