Last year I showed these slide slide demonstrate demonstrate that the calotta , which is about three million years , had the size of 48 million years , the United States , is restreet 40 percent .
But it 's a subvalley the gravity of the problem because it doesn 't show the spent the ice of the ice .
The Arctic glacial cycle is , in a sense , the pink of the global climate system .
You go up to the wall , you 're snice .
The next slide is going to be a quick carrelated to the last 25 years .
The ice acts are made in red in red .
As you can see , you go to the blue wall .
That 's the ice in the winter , you 're ritizen .
You can see that the path of the path of five years or more , is like blood , which is as a blood , which is as a blood , which is how to blood .
In 25 years , it 's been done by so .
This is a problem because the rescale of the entire entire height to the ocean ocean in the ocean artical , where there are enormous amounts of carbon congelated that , you have been transformed in the microbes .
Right to the totality of the inquination , the amount could double , that amount could doubt , super------return .
In some laghi , in Alaska meter is already rebologist in the water .
The professor Katey Walter of the University of Alaska , is recently reverted with a team of a lake , the way .
Video : Wow ! Al Gore : I 'm good . I 'm going to be if we 're also going to be .
A reason is that this is the termal rescale from the North Groenland from the northern North .
This is a glacial pack-regime .
The landed never reached levels .
This is the Kangerlussued Kangerlussues .
If you want to know how to be the level of the sea level of the sea level of the sea .
These are going to go through rapidly .
The other side of the planet : Antards , the biggest block of the planet .
The month , scientists have dichied that the bilannotion of the ice is in negative , and that the West Antarctes , which pogers on some islands , is particularly rapid d in the leaving leaving .
It 's about six feet of the acque level , like in Groenland .
Sulla Himalaya , the biggest third block , you see new laghi , who were glaciers .
40 percent of the world population will remajor half of the water .
Sulle Ande : this glacier is the fount of the water foundation of this city .
The landed is increased .
But when they diminuminate , the same happens to the water water .
In California , the newnow , in the Nevada is diminured 40 percent .
The hydroins are in the crisis .
The predictions , as you read , they 're good .
The growth in the world door to a remarkable aughtful remarkable .
The environmental disasters are increasing out of the normal , and not precedent .
Four times more numbers in the last 30 years of precedented than 75 .
This is a whole insustainable .
If you look at the historic context , if you can see the consequences .
In the last five years , we added 70 million tons of CO2 every 24 million tons in the ocean every day .
Look at the time of the Pacific area , from the American American , to go to the west , and in both the substers , where there is a roadical imor oxygen in the ocean .
The most of global warming , together to deforestation , together to deforestation , which is the 20 percent , is the use of fossil cobustible .
Our oil is a problem , and the carbon is even worse .
The United States is one of two countries with more emissions , together to China .
And you 'd proposing to build many other carbon carbon carbon .
But we 're seeing a direction of the direction .
These are the anullated projects in the last few years and some versus .
every way , there 's a political lower in our country .
The carbon industry and oil industry have spent 250 million dollars in the last year to promote carbon , which is a pulizy blick .
That picture me something --
So , I 'm Natal Tennessee , where I live , there was a 3.8 billion light-eight billion light-long long long .
Maybe you 've seen on the news .
This is the second larger flow from last flow in America .
It 's happened around Natal .
The puzzle of one of the carbon industry was this .
Video : Yeah , I 'm going to be a high high , and it 's a happy kind of happy .
It 's abundant in America , and it 's growing our economy .
Frosty the carbon is more and more and more and more and more clean .
It 's good price , adorable and work they 're going to be pend .
Al Gore : From here is a lot of the West Virginia .
The biggest minerair society on mountain is Massey Coal . This is his administrator .
Video : Don Blakenship : I 'm going to be -- Al Gore , Nancy Peloid , Harry Reid -- they 're not talking about .
Al Gore : So the Alleance for Protext of Clima has two campaign .
This is one of them , a part .
Video : Acore COALergy : ALergy we see climate change as a minacts as a sery minacts to our business .
So , for the first one of the amount of money in a commercial sfort to make public public and confused the truth of the verity of the fuel .
In fact , the carbon is not spring .
We think it 's a good profuse -- it 's also a good profum .
So you don 't prepace of climate change .
Let me do it .
Video : Acore : Carbone pulit -- you 've heard a lot of talk .
So we 're doing a lot of a little bit of a structure to have a little bit about carbon .
Straordinary ! The machines are a little rumorous rumor , but this is the sound of the pulit technology .
The carbon consumers is between the major coal remarkable , but the pulifet-to-up , but the pulilit of the pulit coal , you can see it changed .
You have a look at : this is the coal technology of the pulit of carbon .
Al Gore : From , the alternative alternative to the economic issue and the national security .
Video : The America is in the crisis , the national security , the climate crisis .
The file connects all : our dependence from fossil cobustible , like carbon sporc and oil .
Now , there 's a new , audace ,
Repower : 100 percent of pitches , in 10 years .
A plan to reput America to work , make sure more certainly , and help us to stop the global warming .
Finally , a solution that basts to solve our problems .
Repower . Scover more .
Al Gore : This is the last one .
Video : It 's about return energy to America .
One of the most fast ways to be able to dependence from the combustible combustible that we can kill our planet .
Comparse : The future is here . Vent , a new energy network .
Comparse : Novi investment for the iment places of ben retribes .
Anything : Repower . It 's time to be realists .
Al Gore : A old proverbio : A man man 's like , " If you want to go fast , you go to fast .
If you want to go away , you go together . "
We have to go away , fast .
Thank you very much .
Last year at TED , by a Tr.
And promise to return to enjoy to enjoy them on how the machine .
So here 's the biggest scientific experiment . And the ones that the other time , there were the biggest scientific experiment ever tented -- 27 miles of circumstoms .
His complaw is to reach the conditions that were present less than a billion second from the beginning of the universe -- until 600 million times a second .
All that 's just environment .
This is the Ginevra .
We have a raying these min-Big Bang in the reflies .
This is what I work . This is about 44 feet and it 's about 44 feet and it 's a diameter of 22 feet .
This is a spectacular picture of ATLAS in building so you can see the proportions .
To 10 sets of a last year , we have acceso the machine .
And this picture was taken from ATLAS .
It was because of immense facing in control .
It 's an picture of the first fascination of particle who had done all around the LHC , entering in collision , deliberately , with a part of the HC , and spread particles inside the reflip .
In other words , when we see that picture 10 sets , we realized that the machine , we realized that the machine , which is a great victory .
I don 't know if it was this to be exultate than this , when somebody went on Google and vide that the page began .
That means we had a cultural impact over over over the scientific impact .
About a week after , there was a problem with the machine , just to these fix bles here -- these flies orated dorated .
These fix fix 3,000 print , when the machine is the massive of the potence .
Now , the technique of you will look at the fix , and they say , " It 's not true . I 'm flip too . "
And instead they can do it because when they 're very cosidds .
So , at least 271 degree , at least 271 degree , these fix fix bs can bring that walk .
In one of the giuntures of the most novehicle magnetic nets in the LHC , there was a flip of phables .
So the fix fix law , and 13,000 legs , and 13,000 print suddenly met a electricity .
This was the result .
Now , this is more impressive if you think these magnetic magnetic fish , and they 're moving about 30 centimeters .
They 're drug about 50 magnetic .
We had to take them , what we did .
We represent them and enaged up and enjoy .
Now they 're rerecenter all of their subject .
By the end of march the LHC will be again integrated again .
We 'll access it , and we expect to get to the data , and continue so much as much as our adventure to find out what the morning is the universe .
Now , of course , in a way , these accidents reach the debate of science and engineering in front of science and engineering in front of science and engineering in front till .
I think the fact that the fact that it 's so hard , I think that 's the value of things like LHC .
I want to end up with the words of a English scientist , Humphrey Davy , the ones , I think , in difense , and he said , " Don 't band , his pupille was Michael Faday , he said , " Nist is so dangerous for the progress of human mind how to be definitive the science of the science science that the idea of science science is definitely deppployers , and that 's not the way , and that we don 't have the conflict . "
Thank you .
I want to start asking you to rethink of when , children , you play cococococoon .
As you can understand them as reach and deal them , take them and move them , and you know , learn , and you know , we 're actually going to think and solve problems .
The space is deeply connected to the way we understand a lot of the world around us .
So , from the information usually inspired by the use of the physical objects , together to my consulent Pack-Kalanithi , and my collaborator Jeevan Kalanithi , and I started asking them , " if we use a mouse , but , when we use a little bit of a deal , we can actually crum physical sical sor sweet ,
and siststly to our please ?
The question was so interesting that we decided to explore the answer , building Siftable .
In a few words , a Siftable , a great interactive computer interactive as a bidden .
In a few words , a Siftable , a great interactive computer interactive as a bidden .
You can move with the hand , they can see " between them , " you know , " to feel the movement and they have a screen and a wireless .
But in fact , they 're physical objects , like the morning , you can just crugs .
The Siftable is an example of a new ecosystem to manipulate information .
And as they become more physical , conscientists , you know , other hand , and as they become more physical , and the other hand , and we can exploring new and fun .
I 'm going to start with some simple example .
This is a ftable is configurate to show video : if you 're in a direction , the video rate , the video rate , the rug on the other side .
These retractive rators are aware of other .
If you know , they 're interested in what they 're around .
If they 're surrounded , they can see it up a little bit .
If they 're surrounded , they can see it up a little bit .
They also have their movement and inlination .
And then we realized that one of the interests of the interaction was able to use common data , to example , " to the color like , " we pay a color like it was a liquid liquid .
In this case , we have three Siftable configurate as a great-great-tail , and I can use them to the color , where they 're missing .
and I can use them to the color in that central , where you put .
If we 're too much , we can put a little bit of place .
There are also beautiful possibility of appreciation , like language , like the mathematics and games where people can try and things are very quickly , and you see the results of the immediately immediately .
Now I 'm --
This is a Fibonacting Fibonaces I do with a equations .
So we have a words that 's half of words that 's half in Scareer and Boble .
Pratically , at any reviewed a letter case on any case of Siftable , Pratically , at every turnal turnal , and as you 're looking at the case of compories , and as you 're looking at the words .
Then , after about 30 seconds you remissing , and you have a new land-smart and new possibility to try .
Thank you .
So here 's the children came to the Media Lab , I did in a way that I tried them and I 've been doing a video .
They 've been liked very much .
And one of the interesting things about this kind of application is that not to have to have many instructions .
You just have to say , " Compones of words , and they know exactly what to do .
Here 's how many other people who are trying to do it .
This is our young young girl , there 's a younger , there on the right .
It was actually wanted to just improve them .
They 're just in the morning , for him .
Now , this is an application of a interactive carton .
We wanted to build a tool for the process of the language Lui Lui is Felix .
It can insert new characters in the scene , by solve the Siftable .
It can insert new characters in the scene , by solve the Siftable .
So , you 're doing the sun .
Video : The sun source is source .
David Merrill : Now he brought a treat the scene .
Video : The treat the horange .
Bel work ! Yeah !
So , by either and put up close and put close to interact with characters --
Video : Bau !
-- by inventing their story .
Video : Her !
DM : It 's a final story with open , and it can decide he can decide him how you fly .
DM : It 's a final story with open , and it can decide he can decide him how you fly .
Video : Very on , throw .
DM : The last example I have time to show you is a tool , I 've been recently , to cameras and exeguing music .
it 's a tool , made of recent , to chamampioning and make music .
The Siftable here from sound as basic , based and bacteria .
Each one of these has four different variations , and you can choose to use .
You can also put these sound in a sequence from to compare .
And I 'm going to take a sweet , " sound " and a sequence . "
These are actually effects you can control from the vial , like the reverbhere and the filtro .
The attacks to a particular sound and then inlenjoy .
And then there are general effects as time and volume , and they 're going to be playing to the sequence .
Let 's look at how .
Video : We 're going to take a basic basic , we 'll put a basic sequence , we can put it into a series , we put in the other base .
Now I 'm going to put a bottom line .
Video : Now I add of percussions --
Video : And now I 'm going to put the filter to the bacteria , so I can control the effect from the vial effect from the vial .
Video : I can see fast the intersequence of inclining the entire sequence of the other side or another .
Video : And now I 'll add the filter to the bottom of the basis to give more expression .
Video : I can recombine sequence , " " " " " " " " " " " " " "
So I don 't have to playing before , but I can sudden , make it longer or most cords .
And now , finally , I can sprring the entire sequence of the Siftable on the left Siftable . "
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is building new interfaces of the new faces like work as our brain work and body .
And today , I 've had time to show you one of the results of this path , and also some possibility that we 're trying to try to bring out from the lab .
The concept I want to put you is that 's coming to this new generation of designed objects to interact with digital media , which will bring information in our world in the way we want .
Thank you very much .
I 'm not seeing the time to talk with all you .
I 'm a writing writer .
I 'm going to be books is the profession , of course ,
It also love and the love of my life .
And I don 't expect that it can change .
But , said , this particular is success recently in my life and career , which brought me to rerecently replaced the entire relationship with this work .
The particular thing is I recently written this book , this wheel called " " Mangia , Prega , " which is the diversity from my books , for some reason reason I was used to use in the world and became a great feelational feelational , and he 's got a great feelational , and it 's an interational feelational feelational ,
And the results is that everywhere , people are treatment .
It 's true -- you know , constructed .
They 're going to be all worried and they say , " Don 't you feel more than I do ?
You don 't have fear to write for all life without able to create a book that can be important to make somebody ? "
that can be important to somebody ? "
It 's rassurance , you know .
But it could go worse , in the way I remember that more than 20 years ago , when I started to say people -- I was an adolescent adolescent -- I wanted to be a writer .
I was going to indict the board reaction .
And people said , " Don 't you cave me to be successed ?
You don 't have fear that the humiliation of reflect killed you ?
You don 't have fear to do this stick , and you know , you 've ever come out and death on a cue mule of the raw , with the bits of the bits of the bits ? "
So , you know .
The answer -- the short answer to all these questions is , " Yeah . "
Yeah , I 'm fear of all those things .
I always had fear .
And I also have a lot of other things that people can 't inguess .
As the algae and other spent things .
But , as I 'm going to write what I thought and I 'd be last monely because ?
Is it rational ?
It 's logical who has been expected to be spent from a job that you 've been born to do .
But what 's so special in the impress creative , and it 's about the mental health mental .
How dad , for example , he was an engineer , and I don 't remember one time in his 40 years of activity where he was asked if he was asked if he 's paper to be engineer ?
There was never -- that block of engineer John , how ?
He didn 't work so much , do you know ?
Onestly , the chemical engineers like group , they have no certainly , in the centuries , reputation of being alcolized .
We writers , we have enough to have this reputation , and not just writers , but creativity of every kind , we have this reputting reputation of being enormous instable .
And it 's not to look at the tribe of the deaths of the magnifments that , only in the ventesimimum century , they die young and often for them .
And the ones that you don 't suicians seem to be really disfaced by their dones .
Nman Mailer , before he died , in the last interview said , " Every book killed me a little bit more " an extraordinary affermonstration about work .
But we don 't buy when I feel like to say , because we 've heard these things so long as we 've been interiorized and accepted the notion that creativity and suffering are in some way to read and the art , in the end , to conflict the way .
And the question I want to take all today is : you know , you know , you know , this idea ?
It 's good for you -- because also watching it from a centimeter of me not good for this supposed to nothing .
I think it 's odious .
And I think it 's also dangerous and I don 't want to see the perpetuated in the next century .
I think it 's better encouraging our great creative minus to live .
And I certainly know , in my case -- in my case -- it would be very dangerous , I 'm going to start to be able to be able to start with the circumstances that are in my career .
Ovice -- I mean , you know , they 're pretty young , I have about 40 years .
I still about four decades of work in me .
And it 's very likely to write about it is going to be jumped by the world as the work that came out after the world as the work that was going to be jumped by my last book .
I 'm going to be slavor because we 're all more or less friends here -- it 's likely to my own spring .
Oh , Gesus , who thought !
You know , this is the kind of thinking that door a person to start to bing the noves of the morning and I don 't want to do it .
I 'm going to keep doing this work that we 're doing this work .
So , the question becomes , how ?
And so it looks like , after many reflective , which the way to be able to be to create a psychologist psychologic , OK ?
I have to find a way to find a lot of security in me , and I 'm writing , and my natural anxial anxial . And as I was trying to go through the time , and I 'm looking for all last year models to see if they could have the best ideas and more sane and more sane and more sane and more sane and more sane .
And how to help people believe in the inerent people who are inerent to be the same creative creative .
And that research took me to the old Grek and an ancient Grek and an anthror Rome .
Seguitem because I 'm giant in certain eye and then go back .
In the ancient Greek and an anthic Rome -- the people don 't think that creativity came to men , OK ?
He thought it was this spirit , and they were the dealing and they come from men from a few source and unknown , for some kind of distant distant and unknown .
The green demand , they were called these spirites of creativity " demons . "
Socrate , wonderful , he believed to have a demon that helaring saggeity from away away .
The Roands were the same idea , but they called the spirit kind of spirit .
which is great , because the Roands don 't really think that a genius was somebody particularly smart .
They believe that a genius was this kind of devine that were living in the murs in the study of a study , a little bit like the elpho Dobby , and who I was issued out to be the job of hidden artist and models the results of that work .
Here 's the distance of -- here is the distance of which is the psychological costruct that protected from the results of your work .
And everybody knew that was so that was so that , right ?
So the anti-artists were protected by certain things , like for example , too much much sm , no ?
If your work was exciting work , you couldn 't take all the time , you all know that they were helped by this genius incorporate genius .
If your work failed , it wasn 't all cold , you know ?
And everybody knew that was your genius to be a incapable .
And so people han conceived creativity in Occcient for a long time .
And then the Renencounter came and all changed , and nacked this great idea ; we put the human being in the universe on all the way of the universe on all the way of the universe .
This was the human reference principles and people started thinking about creativity came from the ililikely to be the creating of the hydgen .
And for the first time in history , you start to refert to this or the artist as a kind of genius to a rather than a person with genius .
And I have to say , I think it was a big error mistake .
I think you can put somebody , a simple person to believe that being as a recipient as a source , the essence and the source of all the mysters , creativity , unknown as a psycholder and etherdes is a responsibility of human psyc .
It 's like to somebody to ingoiate the sun .
It 's demand destores completely the ego and creates all these ingestizy expectations .
And I think it was this pressure to have been destroyed in 500 years .
And , if this is true , and I think that 's the question becomes , and now ?
Can we can do it diversity ?
Maybe come back to a more advvancic comprement of the relationship between human relationship between human relationship .
Or maybe no .
Maybe we can 't be able to docell 500 years of rational thinking in a 18 minutes .
And there are people in the audience who would be the scientific subjects on the notion of , you know , you know , they 're going to follow people to spring the next ones of their projects .
It 's probably not going to convinced you all about this thing .
But the question I 'd like to take is -- why don 't ?
Why don 't you think that in this way ?
Because it 's more sense of any other thing that ever heard about to explain the imprevibility of the creative process .
A process that , as anyone who ever did do something -- so , basically , basically , all of this -- so , basically , you don 't compories .
And in fact , in fact , sometimes it can be completely paranoral .
I 've done this inagainst recently Ruth Stone , who 's 90 years , but he 's been a poetry for all the time in the rural Virginia , and he said that during his infants in the rural Virginia , and he felt it was in if you , a poetry coming from the landscape .
He said he was like a frageous track-air .
And that was coming rotating to her from the landscape .
He felt it , because he was to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able .
He knew that I had one thing to do to do that point and was , words , " to go like a matta . "
And so he 's going to go home and come up from this poem , and it wouldn 't have to get a piece of card and a matter of a little bit of coke , and it was reach , and it would be page to page the page .
Other you can 't be enough enough enough to be fast , so it 's going to be able to get in home and the poetry and the poetry rotolate through and she loved and he would continue to rot the writing through the paesth , and he said , " another poet . "
And then there were the time -- this piece of not dementiches , I 'm going to be the moments where was almost losing , OK ?
So , he was running home and he was trying to go through , and he was trying to get a major , and he was a math in the way , and then said , which was how if you go on with the other hand and steffed .
He cutting the poetry from coda and reputting in his body and the page was going to page the page .
And in these cases , the poetest page would be presented on the last word .
So when I felt thinking -- it 's crazy , it 's exactly the equal to my creative process .
Not all my creative process -- I 'm not a construct .
I 'm a mule , and my way to work is ; you know , you know , you know , I 'm a mule up and go on on the gotten .
But even I 'm going to be in my aggin , I 've been striped against that thing , sometimes .
And I think that also many of you have han .
You know , even if the work and ideas were indeed by a certain source , you can 't be honestly saperhaps .
And what is this thing ?
And how can we relate to it in a way to do not do it , but rather , rather , rather , what do you have to make us remain ?
So , as I 'm the best example of the time time , I 'm the musician Tom Waits , which I 've interviewed the sewhere I 've interviewed in the newspaper .
We 're talking about this , and you know , Tom , for the majority of life is recently recently , the incarring , to start to control , dominating these species of impults , dominating , dominating these species of impults .
But then I 'm going to invent , and one day as he was driving on a road Los Angeles , it 's all over him .
He was going to go through fast and all of a tract tract , and it 's coming into his head as it 's the inspiration , and the enjoy , elusial and the wants , and the wants , you know , it 's wonderful and the desider , but it doesn 't know how to take it .
He doesn 't have a piece of card , it doesn 't have a math , it 's not a major .
So I started to feel this kind of old old old old old , " I 'm going to lose , " I 'm going to lose , and I 'm going to remarred by this sessed sessed sessionated .
I 'm not good enough and I can 't do it . "
And instead of going to go to panic , you stop .
I 'm going to be the whole process and made something completely new .
He just just just the sky and said , " Scause , you know , I 'm not going to see that ? "
" Do you think that writing a song now ?
If you really want to exist , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know ,
Or , you 're going to be able to importantly qualcanother today .
You 're going to disturbing Leonard Cohen . "
And his process worked as well as well as well as well as well as well as well as well as well .
It wasn 't the work , the work was still dark .
But the process , and the fish that was require was require when he was the genius , the genius , the genius that 's the genius of him , and they came back from where , and they were remajor or it was going to be a interized thing .
but you know , you know , the wonderful bizarra collaboration in Tom and this strange and this strange and the outside Tom and this strange and he loved .
So , as I felt that story to change a little bit of the way I was working and already save me a time .
This idea , I 'm going to save , " Ama , Prega , " Ama , " and he 's cadds in one of those cave the quay of the disperation we 're working on something and we can 't start thinking about something and we can 't start thinking that it 's going to be a disaster , which is going to be the worst book .
Not just good , just the worst book writing .
And I started thinking about cause this project .
But then I remembered to Tom who talks about air and I tried to be .
So I alke my face on the dark and deaths my face on the dark and deaths of the room .
And I said to the deal voices , " Supper , what we know if this book is not going to be brilliant , not going to be a brilliant ,
Because as I see you can see it all I have , I don 't have this one .
So if you want to be better , you have to show you and do your part .
OK . But if you don 't do it , you know what , I don 't do anything .
I 'm going to write the same because it 's my work .
And I 'd like like to favor that was registered that I 've been presented to do my part , " Because -- finally , OK -- sweat Africa 's 's the people were rounded for the dancestors to the sacra , and music and sacra and music that went on and handed up to the alba .
And they always magnify , because the ballerins were professionals and they were fantastic .
But every time , you know , something happened happened , and one of these artists becomes in actually transcender .
And I know what you know , because I know you 've all seen , at a performance .
It was like the time , and the ballerd walked through a kind of land-up , and it was not doing anything different from soldier , and it was all all of them .
And suddenly , I 'm not just like a human .
But you accent from the divinity of the divinity of the divinity .
And when this happened , the time , the people knew what was , they were called him .
They were the hands and they started to dotare , " Allah , Allah , Allah , God , God God , " God , " God , " God , " God , "
That 's God , you know .
Curious note historic -- when the More invaser the Spain , I was this absolutely , the sought in the search of the Spain , Allah , Allah , " " " " " " Ollah , " which you can still feel in the courage .
In Spain , when a artist did something impossible and magic , " Allah , " Allah , " Alah , " By , " incompreed , " incompreed , it 's a last thing .
And it 's great because we need .
But the problem comes the day after , for the ballerin the hallerine , when you sweet and discover that are the 11 of Martedday and last thing is not .
It 's just a mortal mortal ginches , and maybe they can 't be able to be able to enjoy that altel .
And maybe nobody will you have the name of God still as yra , and what do you have to do with the rest of his life ?
It 's hard .
This is one of the most paorous recogniliations to make in a creative life .
But maybe it doesn 't have to be so angoscious if you can 't believe , and movement , which is more extraordinary expect of your being come from you .
But you believe that they 're going to be the data in prestirable source of this team of your life that you have to go through something else when you finished .
And , you know , if we think about this all changes .
And so I started thinking about , and it 's certainly as I thought for different months in the work of the book that I 'll be able to be able to be doing , the dangerous , the dangerous , attesissum , attesissued ,
And what I have to keep telling me when I feel eleventually , I 'm not fear .
It 's not just about your work .
Continua to presentate you for your part , any can be .
If your work is bally , ball .
If the divine , assurd on you can take a few kind of wonderful , and let 's go through some kind of wonderful , for one moment through your effort , then , " Ole ! "
Or you do that you have your dance .
And " Ole ! " You know , you know , you know , " You know , " You know , " You know , " You know .
I think , and I think I have to teach it .
" Ole ! " You know , you just have the human love and testownap from the tal tal tali to be a continually .
Thank you .
Thank you .
June Cohen : Ole !
As I 've been talking about some of these projects on the human genome , what can meant and the discovery new set of genes .
Now we 're starting a new pervent . We started digitalize biology and now starting to that digital code , we 're both both in the new biology , design and synthesized and synthized life .
We always tried to bring great questions .
" What is life ? " It 's something that many biologists are trying to understand vars .
We tried different approximate , reduced to the minimum .
We 're digitized by almost 20 years , we 've got digitized by the way .
When we sequenced the human genome was treated to go from the analogical world of the world of the computer biology .
Now we ask ourselves : can we we can regenerate life , or to create new life from this digital universe ?
This is the map of a little organism , Mycoplasma genitalium , which is the species from the genome of the genome of the genome .
And we tried to reduce the genome to create a little bit more .
We can eliminate a centinaum of genes of about 500 .
But when we look at the methabolic map , it 's relatively simple respect to our .
I think , this is simple .
But when we look at all the genes we can eliminate , one at the time , it 's very unimprobable to that this can bring a living cells .
So we decided that the only way to provide was synthize this chromosoma in a way to be able to be able to provide some of these fundamental questions .
So we started the adventure of " can we be synthesize a chromosoma ? "
Can you realize ze that chemistry to make these big molecules that we never have to create before ?
And in case , we can we make a cross ?
A chromosoma is just a piece of chemical material , inerves .
The speed we are to digitalize life is growing to the exponential life is growing to requening .
Our capacity to write the genetic code , instead , progree rather slowly , but it 's improving .
And our most recent results the recently results .
We started more than 15 years ago .
The process required many steps , starting with biothetic revision before the experiments .
But we found that synthesize DNA is very difficult .
There are tens of thousands of machines in the world that produces little segments of DNA , over the long , the longer trial process . And it 's a degenerative process .
So we had to develop a new method to assemble these fragments and correcrect the errors .
And this was the first entative tative , starting to start to the digital information of the genome of the X 174 .
It 's a little virus that kills .
We designed the fragments , effective the correction of the mistakes and get a molecule of DNA about 5,000 lecting .
The interesting part is when we took this piece of chemistry , and we put it into the bacteria , the bacteria have been inserted to read this genetic code and depair the particles .
The viral particles have been releave from the cells , they 're back and come back and they 've been destroyed the E.
I talked about recent recently with the oil industry , and they 're certainly compressed this model .
They have revers more than you .
We believe that this is a situation where software can really build his hardware in a biologist system .
But we wanted to do things bigger .
We wanted to build the entire chmosoma .
They 're more than 580 mile letters of genetic code .
So we thought we built it in the casss of the virus , so that we can change the casss to understand what the components of a living cells .
The design is crucial , and if we start with digital information in a computer , these have to be very accurate .
When sequenced this genome for the first time in 1995 accurate accurattails was a mistakes for every 10 mile .
We found , resequence , 30 mistaff . If we were used that original sequence never be able to do that .
One part of the process is design segments are 50 landed to 50 lecting up with all other segments of the 50 letters to build subunits tiny little working together .
Let 's just take the only one of the unique elements here .
You probably read that we 're sitting in the fix-fixed fixed pyrate .
Think so : We have a genetic code on four letters : A , C , G and T.
Three of those letters together codifetes together to about 20 advvanced planes , and there 's a specific order to read for every frightens .
So we can use the genetic code to write words , frasases , thinking .
What we did at the beginning is autograped .
Some of them were delusers from the fact that it wasn 't poem .
We designed these segments to just just just just a unique points .
There are them to be repair and put them up .
And we started to assembling parts , starting with segments from five to seven mile lecting , unended up to the segments of 24 miles the letters to get 72 to get 72 mile .
And every step we 've produced these segments in abundance so that we 're trying to create a very robustoking , as you 'll see in a minute .
We 're trying to authatize the process .
So , this seems the tabellone of the board board .
When we go to these very long segments , more than 100 miles , more than 100 miles , they will not be directly in the E.
It 's coming to the modern instrument of molecular biology .
So we 've been considered other mechanisms .
We knew another mechanism called the omolog--------indeed DNA to repair .
Here 's an example .
This organism , called the Deinococcus radiodurans , can assupply .
You can see in the sometimes as his crumosoma is destroyed .
In 12 -- 24 hours , it 's replaced as it was before .
They 're thousands of organisms that are able to do it .
These organisms can sit in completely .
They can live in vacacuum .
It 's absolutely sure life exists in space , and you feel places to find new environments of water .
ASA showed that , NASA showed that this is .
This is a picture of molecule that we built by using these processed processed by by the design design , to be able to insert with the segments .
The lights assemble le lights .
This picture wasn 't been taken with a microscope , but with a microscope , but with a microscope .
It 's a lot of molecule we can see the whole whole launch with a law microscope .
These are pictures that are doing a time time of about six seconds .
This is the puzzle we did a little time ago .
They 're more than 580,000 letters .
It 's the biggest molecule of a defined defined structure from man .
It 's a lot of a 300 million .
If you 're going to stay with a caratter 10 without spaces , you want to 142 pages only to be able to transcent this genetic code .
Now , how do we do it work ?
Obviously , tramite a virus is a board board .
It 's a little bit more complicated when you use bacteria .
It 's simply simple when it 's the eucariods like our cell . You can just be just extremely the nucleo and inseries another , which is basically the process of clonation .
In the bacteria , the crumosoma is instead of integrated inside the cell , but we recently demonstrated that we are able to do a cell birthma from one cell to another cell and activate it .
We clean a crumosoma by a microbial species .
The two are different as men from the topes .
We added some gene gene in a way to decide what to do for this chromosoma .
And then he 's sweat with the enjoymes to kill all proins .
And when we put it in the cell was stupendo-- and you open the major subjacail -- the new chromosophisticatoma is went inside the cell .
And we started thinking that we couldn 't go beyond , but we tried by the way , but we 've been going to be in there .
This is one of the major mechanisms .
We found that many species have added a second or a third crumosoma from some part , add in a second thousand new tracts to that species .
So who think about evolution as a one gene , and once you 're modies , it didn 't understand gran part of the biology .
They 're in the enabmes called " restripppace that I 'll advvancing DNA DNA .
The chromosoma that was in the cell .
The mosoma cell phone crumosoma that we 've inserito----board .
You 're expressed , and he recognized the other chromosoma as an express , and we 've been born with only the cell ell and the new cell .
It 's been blue because of the genes we put it .
And in a short lead of time , all the characteristics of a species are gone , and you transformed all over a new species , based on the new software that we 've insered in the cell .
All the properes of propered , the members have changed , and when we read the genetic code is exactly about what we have we transfted .
Now , this may seem altering altering , but altering software DNA we can change things in a lot of substantial .
Now , I 've already explained that this is not about genespy -- but to start starting from three million years and a half million years , and I said that maybe we 're going to create a new version of Cambrian exhihilost in which will be created new species on this process .
Why do that ?
I think it 's enough obvious when we think about our need .
We 're going to go from six billion and a half billion people in the next 40 years .
Right to give an example : I was born in 1946 .
Now there are three people on the planet for each existent in 1946 , there are four .
We 're having problems now to find food , and the water , the water and the heaven and the wine for six billion and a half billion people .
It 's going to be more dying it for nine billion .
We use more than five billion billion carbon , more than 30 billion baries , more than 30 billion baries .
That means a hundred million baries per day .
When I call you try to find biological processed or any kind of process to repair them , it 's going to be a huge challenge .
We have to keep the whole whole emission of CO2 from these materials that 's going to end up in the atmosphere .
At day today , thank you to scientific discoveries in all the world , we have a database with about 20 million genes , and I like to think that are the design components for the future .
The electronic industry , you just have a dozen of about components , and think about how many different things are out .
Our limits here are the data that is the reality and our imagination .
Now we have techniques , thank you very quickly synthesization , in order to create what we call genomics .
We can build a big robot that can produce a big robot that can produce a million chromosomes per day .
Think about these 20 million genes of these 20 million genes or try to get to get either or drugs , new vaccines , and we can change , thank , we can change , thank you to change , thank , and create more biology now that in the last 20 years of science .
And it 's just a standard standard selection .
We can choose for the possibility of survival , or production , or production ,
This is an instantaneous instantaneous software programmed to be able to several and design species .
Well , we don 't know how they 're going to be .
We know exactly how it is the genetic code .
Now we 're looking at the carbons of the generation of the fourth generation .
You 've seen you who extract thanol from the grate was a finished experiment .
We have carbon on , and third generation that are going to be like the cool from the sleep to the cool of the higher than the either either tree or different kinds of butanol .
But the only way the biology can have a great impact without increasing impact without increasing the cost of food and limitaren . The only is the way we 're working on the CO2 in matter before , and we 're working on the cell that can be the first carbon , and we think of that that are the first carbons of the first , and we think we can have the first carbon .
The solar solar light with CO2 is a metodo-- but in our discovers all over the world , we have found different metods .
This is a organism that we 've described in 1996 .
He goes in the ocean profound , about 2,500 feet of the depth of the water .
They create metane from CO2 using hydrogen molecular as a source of energy .
We 're trying to figure out if we can intubes CO2 , which can easily be translated to tramite your , to drive that CO2 in carbons , to drive this process .
So , we can think we can be able to increase the basic question , " which is the basic question , " which is Noi , vering -- we have the modth of the bottom of the bottom industry .
Exactly . If you can 't do it from TED , where you can ?
It would be a main of energy source .
And also , we 're working for use metods to create vaccines .
You 've seen this year with influence , we always go back to a year and a dollar in less when it 's about find the right vaccine .
I think what you can change building vaccines in a little bit of ancestors .
So , that 's how the future may start seemy to change , now , the tree of evolution , with bacteria , which is in the inner cell eyards , and finally cell the euck .
We 're so much from improve people .
Our discovered is to make a way of living enough long enough to try to do it . Thank you very much .
First of all , I 'm going to show you , the most faster possible , of the new technology that we 've taken the Microsoft in the Microsoft , in the next year ago . This is Seadragon .
It 's a environment where you can interact with a huge local amount of data .
So here we 're seeing a lot of gigabyte , a kind of photos with a kind of a sweet , and continuous panoramic , and we 're going to be the images as we want .
And not matter how much much much much information that we see , how big information we see , how big these things are these things like the data or the pictures .
Most are digital photographs , but this is a provide scanen from the Library Library , and reenter in the gm of 300 megaxels .
It doesn 't make any difference because the only thing that limits prestations of a system like this is the number of pixel on the screen in any time . It 's also a very fly very fly very fly .
This is a book , for example , not data .
This is Casa desolate of Dickens . Every colony is a capol .
So , to show you that 's just about the text and not images , we can do something like that , to see that 's a real representation of the text , not a picture .
It could be a way artificial artificial to read a electronic book .
Don 't advice it .
This is an example more realistic . This is a number of the Look .
Every picture is the beginning of a sex----image .
And it really gives you the pleasure and the beautiful experience of reading version of a review of a review or a quotidian , which is for nature mold .
We also did something with the angle of this particular number of the Lodian .
We created a buth butting advertising , and more alta than the one that you use in a normal advertising . And we put in the extra content .
If you want to see the characteristics of this car , you can see here .
Or other models , or even the special specific physical physical physical physical physical physical physical physical physical physical physical physical physical physical physical .
And this really dealing some of these ideas to eliminate the limits of space on screen .
We hope that this means to put up with pop-up and other porcheries , and other porcheries , you don 't have to be necessary .
And of course , the map is one of the most obvious applications for this kind of technology .
And on this is not going to lose time , if we don 't say that we have contribute to to this field .
These are all the streets in the United States , you know , there 's a geo-spacatial picture .
So now we 're going to do something else .
So this is actually actually from the vial writing on the web ; you can go to see .
It 's a project called Photosynth , which combine two different technologies .
One is Seadragon and the other is a visual computer to do that 's a very interesting visual for Noah Snavely , a student of the University of the UW : The Seitz of the UW Szz Rick Szz Szelisi Microsoft Rick . " At the PRick . " At the " PPPh.A. "
And it 's from the Weadragon .
You can see it when we do this kind of screen , which we can go from one image to another picture and have this kind of experience to solution .
But the space of the picture here has actually actually a meaning .
The algorithms of computers have registrated these pictures together , so that you can see , in the revolution that I think -- all the nearest law -- all sweats on the Montagne Roccious dowwaste , you 're scated . Here you see the elements of a destable imaging , and these things are all in the space .
I don 't know if I have time to show you some other environment .
There are some more space .
I want to go directly to one of the original set of Noah-- and this provided by a previous prototypes that we 've done for the first time time , to show you what I think about the first time is really the cediting to show you what I think is really close to behind this technology , the technology Phototosyth . And it 's not necessarily obviously , we 've put in the website .
We had to worry about legal aspects and on the way .
This is a reconstruction of Notre Dame pictures of Nototh , Bast 's digitor . Bast Notre Dame in Flickr and you get pictures of these consequence of the campus and go and by by saying .
So they 're all the Flickr and they were all related to this way .
And it 's possible to be able to be simply simply simply .
You know , I 'd never thought to end up to work for Microsoft .
It 's very gratifying to have this kind of accock here .
I think you can see that it 's a lot of different types of focus cameras : from those of the mobile phone professionals .
And if you can , I try to try to look at those strange .
A lot of are stuck by faces , etc .
A few part here is a series of photographs -- it 's cole .
This is a poster of Nototer Dame registrated .
We can go from the poster to the physics of this environment .
The essential point is that we can do with social environment . This is now now take data from the interest to the collective data from the interine , from the collective view , from the visual point of view -- and connected those data together .
All those pictures become connected together , the major of the sum of the parts .
You have a model of the entire entire emerging model .
Think about this as a prolungation of Stephen Lawler on Earth 's Earth .
It 's something that grows in complexity , as people use it , and the advantages of the use of the use of the use .
Their pictures are hushed with metaded people from other people .
If you know , somebody comes the idea of contrast to each other , and I can use the name of the catteage , my picture of Noter 's 's crugs to be recognize all those data , and I can use how to be able to stop the picture of the space , using the picture of the other things , and have a social experience of the cross-mod-tax-mock-moe .
Of course , a consequence of all of this is virtual models extremely elaborated by any interesting part of the Earth , collected with not solar to be able to see and similar pictures and similar pictures , but by the collective memory .
Mille thank you .
CA : I realized zed well ? What your software is that you have to do is that at a certain point , in the next few years , all the photographs of shared anyone in the entire world , they 're going to be practice together ?
BAA : Yeah . That 's doing it 's doing it , it 's discover .
It 's creating hyperlink , if you want , in the pictures .
And it 's doing it in the bottom of pictures .
The thing is becomes very interesting if you think about recheality information information several of semanties .
As when you take a research research images , you have a phrase and the text of the web page , and the web page on the picture .
Now , what happens if you 're connecting to all your pictures ?
So the amount of semantic interconnection and the amount of rcheap , which is really enormous . It 's a classic effect of the network .
CA : Blaise , it 's really amazing . Compliments .
BAA : I thank you very much .
One of the major likely when you travels and one of the deliix-research research is the order to live in the wind , in the wind , in the wind the past in the wind , you know , the top in the wind , you 're in the wind and the floating and the plants .
Basti thinking about the monanthy Jaguar vize the Via Lattea , or who are the monitors of the anthropolicy , or that in Himalaya , the budddies are still in the Dharm , but , to remember the most of the most anthropology , and that the idea that the world in which the world we live not existic sense , and that the world , but it 's just a model of reality , but it 's just a model of reality .
the consequence of a particular set of actative adaptative choices that our styrs has done , well .
And , of course , we all share of the essential tracts .
We all have been proof creating .
We 're subjects to start .
We have to death the inesorability of death , so we don 't surprising if we 're sweet and whom --
We all have an art .
What 's the particular rhythm of the song , the rhythm of the dance of every culture .
Not matter that they 're the Redwood , or the following the Voodoor or of Haiti , or the the Kenya , or the desert Kenya in Sapert in Kenya , or a smom to the Ande , or a camera , the Curer 's the Sahara .
He was my journey of the journey in the desert a month ago , or a lifestlip of the world values of Qomolangma , the world 's dead mother .
All these people are teachers to us are other ways of thinking , other ways of think , other ways of moving in the world .
And , if you reflect a moment , it 's a concept that can give you hope .
Loook , the myriads of the world creating a spiritual life , and cultural cal club that 's flight the planet as the well-being like the white biologist , as the well-being like biosphere .
And you can think about this reveral al ragnosphere , and you can define the etnosphere , and you can define the thnosphere is total of all concepts , intuitions , intuitions , intuitions are being from the human imagination from the beef of consciousness .
The etnosphere is the fantastic pathrimony of humanity .
It 's the symbbol of what we are and what we can be in how much inquisy .
And because the biosphere was gravly consumed , as as well as well as a fast , and it 's very quickly unfortunately .
Nobody biologist , it would say that 50 percent of all the species is the orest of the extinction just because it 's flead , or the most apocalm -- in the major of diversity -- and it 's not near to the issues of diversity .
He 's indiculous , of course , the persent language .
When you were born 6,000 languages on this planet .
A language is not only composed to a bunch or a series of rules .
A language is a language of the human spirit of human spirit .
It 's the middle of the animal of every culture comes in the material world .
Every language is a forest of mind , a re-inforest , a thought , a thought , a re-spiritual eal ecosystem .
And of those 6,000 languages , as we are in the mid-half .
They 're not teached to children , the one who wants to say , not that 's not going to be a lot of death .
What is we have more tribe to be aved by the silence , of being the last talking about a language , of the way to talk , of not have a way to transmit , or an anticipate the promise of the children ?
This is a few of somebody in the world in some of the world of the two weeks , every two weeks , a lower mur and door with the board , the last sillabs of a ancient language .
And I know somebody who will say , " Do you don 't better ?
The world would not be a better place if we all talk ? " Well , then we 're talking about all yoruba . So we 're talking about all yoruba .
I 'm going to talk about kogs .
You 're going to be a tract thing that can 't talk about their language .
I 'd like to do a journey through the etnosphere --
a little journey in the etnosphere to give you a bunch of what we 're losing .
A lot of us forget that when I say , " different ways of exists , " I mean , really different ways of exists .
Let 's take for example , the Barasana , in Amazonia , in Amazonia , the people in the anaconda , which crees the midden sacond the sacond of the sacond of the sacond of the sacond sacony .
It 's a popular popular that it 's not able to distinguess color from the green because the time . The moved is identifed in the forest , which is the popular .
They have a strange language and a remonial rules , " examial language , " You have to save a person who talks about a different language .
All of that has been roots in the mythologic past mythologist , in these families and extremely , in these families and the mysts of the mysts of the mysts .
They just just listen to listen and then start talking about .
Let 's take one of the most interesting tribe that I lived , the Waoran Ecuador noriental , an incredible popular popular people who had the first contact in 1958 .
In 1957 missionaries have been tented by by by by by by by 1957 missionaries .
They did take out from the top photographs that they were reraw up to rereraw , and forest , and forest , and forest that this popular forest had never seen bi-dimensional .
They collected the picture from the Earth , they went to research a shape or a shape , or a shape , they 're not coming out of the diet , and they kill the five missionaries with the lawyers .
But the Waorans not just kill the strange strange .
They killing between them .
Our 54 percent of the mortality was caused by their same .
We 've been rised to eight generations and we found two cases of natural mors and when we 've been inspiring to know , they 've been invent so he 's dead , and then killed him him , and then killed him him him him the same .
The crugs were able to recognize the animal of 40 steps and recognized the species .
In the first ' 80s , I 've been assigned a very interesting task when my Harvard , I was assigned to go to Harvard , if I wanted to go to Haiti to sweet the basic sic society of Duvalier and Tonton Macope , and impossessed up to the sweet and .
So , I 'd have to make sense of myracolost , I 'd have to understand Vodoor , which Vodoor is not magic magic magic .
It 's pretty much a vision metaphical vision of the world .
A lot interesting .
If I ask you to tell the great religions of the world , what would you say ?
Cristianesimum , Islam , Buddism , Ebraism , and so that .
A continent is always left out , thinking that Africa is not a lot of religious people . And instead of religious , and the Voodoo is not other than the wilside of these concepts are very profound deep in the tragic religious concepts in the schiavizy of the slavior .
What makes interesting is that it makes a voodoo is the intense report between life and death .
So the vision they hidden the spirits .
The spirits can be invocated by the Grande Acqua , they are the rhythm of the dance of the dance of the vial way that 's the following the way to the follow is to the follow becomes the way .
So , the voodoers love to say , " You know , white you go to talk about God .
We say , we 're going to say , " We 're going to be able . "
And from the moment you 're sitting , is the spirit that you guid , how you can you do bad ?
So you 're seeing incredible event event event : following the voodoor in the state of trance that touch impunted by the power of the power of mind , when it 's catalyzed in a state of extrtract .
You know , all the people with which I lived the most extraordinary of Sierra Nevada Santa Marta Marta Marta , in the Santa Marta Marta , in the smart sect .
It was retreatment of the major of the major , the people were in the caraibor of Colombia in the conquister , the popular is ritic sunk that the vulum of the vuldog , and they were retreatment .
In a continent drumers , this popular , this popular is never conquisted by the Spanish Spanish .
But they 're also government today , they 're government from a clero , but their formation is really extraordinary .
The young people following up from the families to three or four years , and live secreating in a world of good good and hombought in a world of the glaciers .
Two damage noves years old old old choices to reproduce the noves months of the management that translated in the utter of the mother , now are metaphorically in the Grank Mad .
So , for all that time , they 're acculate values that they predict their preglaciers and only their preglaciers and only their preglacier , or to say the equilibrium -- or to say the equilibrium , or to say the equilibrio or the balance .
At term of this incredible initiation , they 're very strongly out and for the first time in life , at the age of 18 years , they see a alone . And in that accounterial consciousness of the first ball , when the sun sun the pysun , all that they 've learned in theory , and that 's the concerned in the theory is actually conscious splent , and it 's deal , and they 're going to go back and say ,
" I said , " I 'm going to have you .
It 's study . Now it 's about you protect it . "
They call it the major fraters and they are the injected colors , we are the colliphip of the world .
This is extremely important .
When we think about the invote populations and invote the environment of the noble named " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " Theau and say that we say these people are closer to the Earth are closer to the Earth .
The popular ingenes are not feeling to be indebolites from the nostaly .
There 's no space for these things in the palual palual , and in the wind the Tibet , but thank you to come up , and the rules , they created a mystics of the Earth 's board not on the concept of the Earth can only be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to uncause the idea that the Earth can only live because it 's infuse by consciousness .
What does it mean ?
And I mean , a guy who growing the Ande that grows is a spirit Apu who 's a spirit Apu who 's destine that 's going to be a very different human being being being being the different . And it 's going to have a ben massive bit of rock with the mountain that place to a mountain mass of rock that mountain a mass of rock of rock rock .
which is the dimora of a spirit or a mineral cuts is irrievant .
What 's interesting is the metaphor that defines the relationship between individual and natural world .
I grew up in the Columbia British credying the forests were able to be cut .
And he made me a human being different from my friends Kwakiutl that believe that the forests are the Hukuk and the band the band the blood the waste behind and the wills that are going to be the northern world , spirites that are going to be in the same same Hamatsa .
If you start to look at that these cultures can create reality , you can start to understand some of their own feelings .
I 've been taken this picture to aprile in the nordocccial Amazonia .
Maybe some of you 've heard about the ayahuash , the most powerful psychoactive repertocy .
What makes it fascinating the ayahuash is not the potential to be the major of the substance , but his elaboration . It 's composed to two elements .
On a side , this lian law that 's a series of cool , harm and harmful , harmful and , law , law , and it 's hallucinted .
I 'm going to be a blub bluster , and it 's a little bit the consciousness , but it 's mychoose with the leaves of a coffee family 's called Psychotrist said , Psychotridis .
This plants of containing slamine , very similar to the serotonin , dimethyllyllamine-5 , methoxtamine .
If you ever see Yanomami to see Yanomami to the nose of the nose , which is a different species , anchy methoxypamine .
Tiring that polar poor is a little bit like to be parked by a bunch of paints and rewalk on a sea of the CEEverything is not creates a distorsion of the reality of the reality .
I was often going to do with my professor , Richard Evan Shultes , the man who 's been psychc , with his discovery of the fungi of the load fungi , with his discovery of the fungi of the lower fungi in Mexico .
Second , I don 't have to classify these tripptamine as well as well as if you can 't tell nobody of being hallucinated .
It 's possible to assumerely the horrise of other chemicals than the MAO .
Now , you know , the Is that they find in this lian lian lian lian area of MAO , the same kind of necessary to be able to potential the tripal . The question of the kind of spontaneous , how they 're in a flap , how they believe that they have been arne to find two deales dealing not like that , they believe a biods , they believe a biochemical version of the s-waster .
We use the great eufemism of the prove and the mistake , which can reveed in the infrufer .
But if we ask the Indians , they 'll say , " The piant talks about it . "
What does it mean ?
This tribes , the Cofan , it 's 17 variety of ayahuash , which is nice nice in the forest , and the eyes are going to be in the same species .
If you ask them , if they ask them , they 'll say , " I thought I realized that I knew realized that I was about the rest , and you don 't know ? "
The solution is : you take the 17 variety of the moon , in a night and each other .
And so , you don 't read to Harvard , but it 's much more interesting to content the stami .
Now , in fact , and they 're going to be the problem is that even the ones of us who have to heart people are pitten , but in some way , in a way reduced margins of the history of the history of the history of the history of the world , and pass over .
In fact , the XX century , there 's not going to be remembered for the guerre or innovation technologies , but rather as the was where we 're stopped and we 're acted and we 're acted to the mass of the mass of the mass of the diversity of diversity and cultural cultural diversity and cultural cal cultural cultural , and culal , and we 're in the planet . Now ,
All the cultures through the centuries were involved in a dance for new possibility of life .
And the problem is not the technology .
The Indians Sioux , they don 't have been stopped when they put out of the arch and they 're so in the American , they 're stopped by the homan and calm .
It 's not the change or the technology that are the integrity of the ethnosphere . It 's the power .
The domination of domination .
And if you give a look at the world , you know that these are not destinated in the world , you know ,
They 're living and dynamics are creatures out of the hyper--hyper-hyper-hyper-s-like .
I know , you know , they 're demand in the paper of the Penan eat of the Penan indeed .
a popular no-made Sarawak , in the soul of the Sarest 's popular , a popular popular , and now reduced to the servitor , and now reduced to the servitor , and hour to the prostitution of the fibs , where you can see the fiume indeed by the sweet of the lim Meric Cinese Meric , where the doubled to the dought the doubt , where the dought ,
You 're going to take the wood wood with the dream of the subtact of the forest .
Or , in the Yanomami , are the disease that are the disease that 's the discovery of the gold .
If we move on on the Tibet , where I 'm doing a lot of researchers , you 'll see the during volunteer of political domination .
As you know the genocide , the physics of a popular popular , is constructed to the universal level , but the destruction of the style of life , not only is construction , not only it 's converted , but advvanced in certain environments .
And you can 't understand the suffering of the Tibet until you 're part of the beginning .
I 've been on the 6,000 miles of Chengdu in Chengdu through Tibet , and I 've got to Lhasa with young young link , but only came to Lhasa young link , but only came to Lhasa lot of speak .
6,000 monuments reduced stums in the dust and cencourts .
1.2 million people killed by military military , in the Cultural Rivolution .
The dad of this guy was ascritical to the Panchen Lama .
which means that it 's been killed to the temple of the Chinese invasion .
I 'm worse with Santity Santity in Santity in the diaspora that brought the popular in Nepal .
His mother was impried and his colll was rejected .
It was brought to the age age of two birth years in the age of two years hidden rown .
The sister , which has been put in rejected in reeducation .
A day he inavailed a pested cofferurant 's Mao and , for this transgression , it was put forced to the several years .
The Tibet 's pain , but it can be inspirit , but the spirit recenter .
At the fin , all of you reduces a choice .
We want to live in the world world world world 's the micro-we want to account the world policy ?
The great anthropologist Margaret Mead , before he said that his biggest fear was that , in our own view of the world , not only to see the entire gm of the world , not only we 'll see the entire gams of human reduced reduced , but one day there is a sleep to a mody--sleep .
And it 's umillion years old , in fact , in fact , in fact , in fact ,
The Neolitics , who gave us the agriculture , which has done us to underground the cult of the sees of the sees of the sees of the sweat with the clero , creating the gerarchieving , and we talk about 10,000 years ago .
The modern world industrialized has 300 years .
That squalist story , I 'm not suggests that we have the risk to all the challenges that we have to deal in the millennia to come .
When to these myriads of the world is asked what it means to be human , they respond with 10,000 voices .
And it 's in these rispowers that we all have the chance to be what we are : a kind of a conscious species , which has to make the way that all the people and the jobs can fioring . And there are great movements .
I 've been taken this picture on the extremity of the North island of Baffin , when I went to the whales of the whales , and this man , Olaya , he said , " Olaya , he told me the wonderful story of his grandfather .
The down------in--indeed with the people in the ' 50s to stbiliar our supremiracy , we 've throw them in colonies .
The grandfather of this man refuted .
The family , I 'm going to take his life , and they 'll take on all the time , and all of his ackets .
You have to know that Inuit doesn 't have the cold , they 're going to be the cold , they 're going to be the cold ,
The packins in the origin of cars were made of brought in the pain of cars .
The grandfather of this man did not intimidnight or from the libraries or from the libraries .
It 's sleep , you 're calculated , you 're calculated in the photos and defecated in their hand . When I I did it put them up , the work creating a lama .
He sprring up on the points of this coltelem , and when it became solid , killed a dog .
He made a gaughed dog , with the cassy cases made a sleta , he 's imbrilled another dog and he 's disappeared on on the banks , the telem of caccess , the tellies of caccess to the caccess .
We want to talk about cavarselling with nothing ?
In the total government 's 1999 , the downn--territory control of an area of territory territory , and Texas mmitted by the largest California and Texas mmmitted together .
It 's the new paper . It 's called Nunut .
It 's an independent territory . They 're going to be a minerarious territory .
One of the splendius of as a natione-state can recognize with his popular people .
And , to finish , I think it 's pretty obvious at least at the world , it 's been in these remote remote , it 's not remote remote .
For somebody 's house .
They represent several imagination that are alba to the date of the temple . And for all of us , the dreams of these children , like the dreams , they become part of the swim of geography of hope .
And finish , we 're in National Geographic , we 'll have politicians who are not going to be anything .
We believe that polemies --
[ Applausi ] are not persuasive , but we believe that stories can change the world , and maybe we are the best institution to tell stories of the world . Every month of the world . Every month of the world .
156 countries transmitted our television television .
Our reviews from millions of people .
Our work is to travel in the ethnosphere to bring our audience in the cultural places from which they 're going to be able to see , and they 'll hope , they 'll be able to , and they will be able to find a style world , the world will be the world of exists in diversity , and we have to find a style world in the diversity world , and we have to find a main world of life in the diversity , and the world 's world .
where the saggeity of all people can contributed to our well-being collective well-being collective well-being collective well-being collective wisdom .
Thank you .
I 'm going to talk about some things I 've written in this book that you 've already heard and proversus , in the case you 're going to be able to prove some of the links , in the case you 're not born .
I want to start with what I call " the official dogma "
The dogma official dogn :
The dogma official dogn society , the western official dogma , " If we want to massive the well-being of the well-being of the well-being of the same as an individual freedom to be similar freedom . "
The reason is , from one side , in fact that freedom is pretious , it 's pretious , it 's pretiful , essential for human beings .
And then , in fact that if we are libitten , each of us can act for all the way to do this is that massive to do , no one who decide in our name .
The way to massive freedom is massive to massive freedom .
More choices people , more are librought , and more more or is their well-being .
This , I think , is so depppath in the society that nobody would dream to put it in the doubt .
And it 's also deppppath in our lives .
I 'm going to show you some examples of what progress has made possible .
This is my supermarket . It 's not particularly great .
I loved a simple note on conditions for inhimself .
In my supermarket , there are 175 conditions , without constructing the 10 variety of the extract of the olive , and 12 aceters that you can buy for a huge number of conditions in the inct nobody of 175 miles .
That 's the supermarket .
Then you go to the wave of electronic electronic stereo : you know , the CD , lector , radio , the lefer .
And in this single one of the electronic store , there 's a great number of audio components .
We can make six million and a half million different combinations that there are in one store .
You have to admit that there is a lot of choice .
Atri the world of communications .
Once , when I was a child , you could get all the telephone services , and pat the pat the pat the pat the mom .
He had a phone , you don 't buy it .
A consequence of this , in the other , it was that the telephone never break .
These days are gone .
Now we have a new-limited variety of telephones , especially between the mobile phone .
Here 's the cell phone phone .
My favorite is that in the middle , P3 , cut buts of nose , and forced forced to the brand and the land-s-up land-up .
If you don 't have seen in the store store under the store , you 're going to be able to come .
And what happens is that people go to the people enter in the sgods and make this question . And you know what is the answer ?
It 's not possible to buy a cell phone that you don 't do too much .
So , in other life that are much more important than the acquirts of the acquirts , you know , the same explosion of choices .
Axstand blood of healthcare : it 's not going on on the United States that you have to do .
Instead , you go from the doctor , and the doctor says , " OK , we could be doing A , or B , " Ages these benefits and the risks . " Bones these benefits and the risks . What do you want to do ? "
You say , " Dr. "
And the doctor says , " A has these benefits and the risks , and B has these benefits and these risks . "
" What do you want to do ? "
And you rebatch , " Dr. "
And the doctor : " But I 'm not her . "
The result we call it " autonoman , " expression that makes it seem like a beautiful thing .
But it 's actually not that one to sleep and responsibility to take decisions from somebody knows something , obvious , and it 's the doctor , to qualcy another than anything -- and so not knowledge , so it 's not about it , and so not in the ideal condition to make the patient decisions .
There 's a huge marketing of products , you know , they 're going to be like me and you , if you think about it 's no sense , because you can 't understand them .
But if we can 't buy them , because they have public icizate ?
The answer is that they want to be domorning , we 're going to be the rich doctor .
So , what 's so fundamental as our identity is a question of choice , as you see in this vignist , " We don 't want to forced the children . "
And we can reinvented us how many times us .
which means that every morning , you have to decide that kind of person want to be .
It was like to the family and marriage , a time time the common , in the way , in fact , in almost for anyone , was that it was that you could be the most price possible , and it was starting to make the most price possible .
The only versus it was with who , not when , and you don 't even know what do after .
Ose , all that 's really to play .
I 'm going to start very smart students , and I 'm 20 percent of the work of time .
And it 's not because they 're not a brilliant because they 're not dealing .
but I 'm unbelieved , I mean , I 'm going to be able to be there or no ?
" Do I have to think about the children or career ? "
They 're interrogatives of logatives .
And they 're trying to answer these questions , even though this is not to be able to be able to be able to be able to be a beautiful vote to my examples .
And they have to do it . They 're important questions .
Now , the work : We 're lucky , like Carl soon , because technology allows us to work every minute , every day , from every day , from every day , from the planet , and the Hotel Randolph .
I 'm talking about , there 's a angoline , and I 'm not going to tell anyone , where the WiFi works .
I 'm not going to use it , because I want to use .
What does that mean , this incredible freedom of choice that we have about work ? It 's to continue , continuously , if we have to work or not .
We can go to see our son play cell phone , with the mobile phone in a pockberry , the Blackberry in the other , and the notebook , becomes on the gink .
And even though they are all spent , every minute we see our children , we 're also asking the partician , " I 'm going to answer this call ? "
" Do I have to answer this email ? I have to bright ? "
And even when the answer is " no , all this makes the experience of your children , very fun from what it would be in other conditions .
So , from any way we look , little , things and big , objects and life , the stuff and life is a question of choices .
Once the world was this : Ovreal , there were some possibility , but it wasn 't a question of choice .
The world of today looks like this : The dilemma is , " It 's a positive thing , or negative ? "
The answer is Same : The answer is Surring .
The law layers we all know , so I 'm going to talk about the negatives .
All this choice compories two effects effects on people .
The first , paradoxally , is that produced paradoxed instead of freezing .
And so , you know , you 're going to be very difficult to do it .
I give you an example of meaning : a conduct conducted pink .
A link to my colleagues had access to the data of the Vanhealthy , the society of a half a million clients .
What she found out is that for every 10 solutions that are offer----percentage writes .
With 50 sources , there is 10 percent of adesions , there 's 10 percent of adesions . Why ?
Because with 50 sources , which choose , is maledly difficult decide , and they choice is remaining .
And I ask ask , and again , asked , asked , asked , asked , and of course , I 've never come .
You don 't just mean only that these work from old old old work for their own own own own own own own money , even want to say that decision is so osticy-in-source source is so so osticy that they lose the birthday of work .
I 'm not talking about , they 're losing until five to five dollars for year from the dator of work , which would be brought to be true .
So the paralis is a consequence of having too many choices .
And I think it makes the world .
" And to end , " And to end , ketchup , or maionese , or maid ? "
You 're going to take the right decision , if it 's for the eternity , right ?
You don 't want to choose the wrong wrong , and you know , or the wrong condition .
So this is the first effect . The second one is that we also can avoid the paralis and do a choice , at the end , we 're less subsit from the results that we were in the same results .
And this for different reasons .
One of these is that with many conditions are going to be better . And you buy one and not perfect , it 's easy to imagine that you could have a different choice that would be better . And that 's what happens is that the alternative imaginative to be better . And that 's that 's the alternative to indeed with decision , and repeak replaced by the decision of the deal , and repair diation of the pair ,
And even when it was a good decision .
And you have more choices , more is easy displeasure of any detail that 's insubsit .
And also , there is what economists call .
Dan Gilbert has close very well stamatin as value as the value of things that we 're converted with .
And then , when there are so many options , it 's easy to represent characternative alternative of the alternative alternative arms and be less subjective .
So , this is an example . I 've got a lot of the New York .
But that 's what you might think .
There 's this copy from the Hamptons .
A lussian place .
It 's all about the way . Otma day . It 's all about them .
I don 't miss anything . But what he thinks is , " Well , malbuildings , it 's Agotten . "
" All my neighbors in Manhattan is on . "
" I 'm going to talk about it just in front of you at home . "
And he pass two weeks assillate from the idea that 's losing -- every day -- the possibility of parking .
The exist opportunity to diminate subsidiminate for what we have , even when the choice was been here .
And the options we have to consider , more the characteristics are retractive .
Here 's another example .
This is a lot of things .
It 's about the time , and maybe a living lently .
But the most important point is that you choose , you wouldn 't do other .
The things we don 't take a lot of attractive active active , they can make less attractive what we do .
Third point : The spiral growing of expectations .
I 've tried to my skin bought a new couple of jeans .
I 'm going to be jeans .
Once jeans were just like a kind , you buy and bought them and bought from the window , they just had them a lot of times , they were just shown them a lot of times , they were getting good .
So , I went to buy a couple of a new time when the old old old old old old , and I said , " I need a couple of jeans , this is my cut . "
He said , " Look , you know , the slim slim , releasy fit ? "
Do you want to the cernist with the bottons ? "
" Look at the way ? "
" Seight them or stretttank ? Bla bla -- " Continured to elencounter .
I was sweet , and after a little bit of , I 'm going to say , " I want the kind of -- which was the only guy . " He had no idea of what , so for a few few days , then I 'm going to be able to say , " I 'm going to use jeans , and then I 'm out of the best jeans that I 've ever had .
It was the massive . I got the whole choose to get the best .
But I feel worse .
Why ? I wrote a whole book to understand it .
The reason I was worse is that I was worse is that with all the choice was altill jeans have to be perfect .
I was expected to be a minute . I didn 't wait for any exception when there was just a kind of , but when I live in 100 different , accidents , at least a kind of being perfect .
What I had to buy was good , but not perfect .
After paragoned what I was insubsidied with what I was ssmothered in conflict .
The add of options in life , they don 't do to increase the expectations these are respect to the cell of the options .
And this will propert less subsidized , even when the results are good .
Nobody in marketing world , you know ,
Because if they knew , you wouldn 't know what I 'm talking about .
The truth is assumptions .
" He was better when you were worse . " The reason you were better when you were worse is that when you were worse is that when you were worse .
Ose , in the world we live -- opulent , industrialized industrialized citizens with expectancy of feeling -- the massive things are at the altel of expectation .
You never have surprised pleasure because your expectations , my expectations , they 're injected .
The secret of happiness -- what you 're here -- is , " Britain wait . "
I mean , little careography moment -- that are actually smared and my wife is really amazing .
I couldn 't do better , I 'm not accounted .
But it 's not always a good thing .
And finally , a consequence of buy a couple of jeans is that the kind of jeans is that when you 're not subddisrupon , and you ask , " Why ? "
" Who is responsible ? " " " , the answer is clear .
The world is responsible . What can I do you ?
When you have a hundreds of jeans , and you buy a satisfacent , and you ask you who are the responsible , is altreatment , is altreatment , it 's altreatment , and you 're going to be able to .
You could have better .
With hundreds of variety of variety available , there are not willing to the insuccess .
So when people take decisions , even though the outcome is , you feel like they 're sitting , they feel like they 're sitting and damage the colps .
In the last few years , it 's explose in the industrialized world .
I think a factor that meanant factor -- not the only , but important -- of this depression is that people have been too high .
And when they have to explain this situation that the colps are .
So the final results is that in general , objectively , but we feel worse .
Let me remember .
This is the official dogma , what we all take for good and it 's completely flead .
There 's no doubt that a little bit of choice is better than they don 't have , but by this one , it 's not better than a little bit better than a little bit .
There 's a critical value , magic value . I don 't know what it 's .
But I 'm sure we 've super---break .
Now , from political perhaps -- I 've been finished -- from the political view , the nocction is the following .
And it allowed all this choice in the industrial society is the material rich .
There are many places in the world , and you know , you know , where the problem is not that they have been too many choice .
The problem is that they have too few .
So the cenda I 'm talking about is a malbe exclusive males of modern , rererevolution .
And what it does to deal and arrator is this : Steve Levitt you 've talked about these expensive and the same ones of the expensive and the bombi ways . It 's a sprite of money .
I mean these choices , complicated and avoid , it 's not just inuseful .
They 're in a dollar .
They 're worse .
If a little bit of what in our society in our society allows , and it 's reversed in those where people have too few possibility , it would not only be their lives to improve .
This is what economists call a parety-scale .
A redistribution of redistribution re-income redistribution -- not only to poor -- because of this choice in the excess of it .
So , I mean , you can be all become what you want " --
You know , the culture , you think , " But what does that fish ? "
" It 's obvious you can 't make anything in a glass . "
" A recastrated vision , a limited vision of the world -- "
and I 'm interpreted to this so , at the beginning .
But then , I 'm made , instead , I realized that that fish is the long knows the longer .
Because the fact of the fact , if you mand in frantums , so that you can 't do the freedom .
If you break the board , you know , you can deminate the subsididies .
You can get the paralis , and you reduced the well-being .
Everyone needs a sphere .
This is almost certainly too fast , maybe even even for the fish , and certainly for us .
But it 's absolutely a few sphere is a recipe for infelity and , I 'm going to be a recized recience .
Thank you for heart .
