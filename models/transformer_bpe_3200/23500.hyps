Last year , I showed these slides to show that the glacial calottica , which for almost three million years had the size of 48 million years had the size of 48 million years had the size of 48 percent .
But this underlying the gravity of the problem because it doesn 't show the spaces of the ice .
The arctic of the arctic , in a certain sense , the heart of the global climate system .
You know , you expanded up and ritized summer .
The next slide will be a rapid carried on the next 25 years .
The glaces are taken in red .
You see , they 're expanding until the blue wall .
That 's the ice in the winter , which is ritired .
You can see that the cosidged ice , of five years or more , is like blood , which is like blood , which is like blood .
In 25 years , it 's past , so .
This is a problem because the heat the whole heat ice . The ice ice ice ice ice ice ice ice around the arctic , where there are huge amounts of carbon congelated that , they 're transformed in the microbes .
I think about the totality of the atmosphhurs from global warming , that would double could doubling , super-scale , super-rate , super-return .
In some deep deep lack in Alaska meter deep in Alaska is already rebling from water .
The professor of the University of Alaska was Alaska was a team that was a lower bottom of a team that was a lower bottom .
Video : Wow ! Al Gore : Wow ! The question is , if we 're going to be .
And that 's why this termicated exchange the Groenland from the north .
This is a glacial regime .
And he had never reached levels .
This is the Kangerlussulussuaq , in the Swest of Groenland .
If you want to know how the sal level of the sea of ice ice on the ground , here is where the achievil comes .
These running current current .
On the other side of the planet : Antarctica , the largest block of the planet .
The month last month scientists have dichieve that the bilange of ice is in negative , and that the Western Antarctica , which is very rapid on some islands , is particularly rapid the proud .
It 's six feet of the miles of the water , like Groenland .
Sulla Himalaya , the third largest block of ice , you see new lack-year-old lyachieved .
40 percent of the population of the world population is to half of the water from that the mondial water .
Sulle Ande : this ice is the source of water water .
The led has increased .
But when it diminues , the same happens to the water .
In California , the snow on Sierra Nevada is diminured of 40 percent .
The idrices are in crisis .
The predictions , as you have read , they 're great .
The growing ssafs in the world leads to a remarkable aughing .
The environmental disasters are increasing out of the normal and without precedented .
Four times more numbers in the last 30 years , respect .
This is a whole unsustainable ,
If you look at the context of the historical consequences .
In the last five years , we 've added 70 million tons of CO2 , 24 million tons of CO2 , 25 million tons in the ocean every day .
Look at the area of the oriental Pacific , from the American American American American American , to the waste of the parts of the continue of indeed , where there is a royal impoverty .
The major cause of global warming , together to deforestation , which is the 20 percent , is the use of fossil fuel .
The oil is a problem , and the carbon is even worse .
The United States is one of the two countries with the most emissions , together to China .
And he was going to try to build many other carbon coal .
But we 're seeing a way of a direction .
These are the anullated projects in the last few years and some highnative alternative alternative propots .
And so , there 's a political load in our country .
The carbon industry and the oil have spent 250 million dollars in the last year to promoting carbon , which is a pulylit oxymous .
That image remembered me something --
Natal , in the Tennessee , where I live , there was a 3.8 billion ligallons of carbon dioxide ligers .
Maybe you 've seen it on news .
This is the second largest flow of last blow in America .
It 's happened around Natal .
The advertising of one of the carbon industry was this .
Video : Swear . It 's a little bit of a kind of allegro and happy .
It 's abundant here in America , and it 's growing our economy .
Frosty carbon is more and clean .
It 's good price , adorable and working on the maintain stypen .
Al Gore : From here is a lot of the West Virginia .
The biggest minerair society on the mountain . This is his administrator . This is his administrator .
Video : Don Blakenship : I 'll be clear -- Al Gore , Nancy Pelosy Pelosy-Reid -- they don 't know what they 're talking about .
Al Gore : So the Alleance for the Clima Protext Protext .
This is one of them , one part .
Video : Attore : ALergy : Alla COALergy we see climate change as a tiny tiny to our business .
So , our priority is to invest a big amount of money in a bunch of advertising , and confused the truth .
In fact , carbon is not sporite .
We think it 's clean -- it 's also a good profum .
So , you don 't precupatate of climate change .
Let me do it .
Video : Carbone : Carbone -- you 've heard a lot of it .
So we 're going to make a turn into a part-to-avange structure for the clean .
Straordinary ! The machines are a little rumorous , but this is the sound of the pullit technology .
The carbon consume is among the major causes of global warming , but the remarkable technology of the pullit that you see changes all .
You look at a look at : this is the clean technology of clean .
Al Gore : Indeed , the alternative alternative consequence and the national security .
Video : Comment : America is in crisis ; the economy , the national security , the climate crisis .
The file that connects all : our dependence from fossil fuel fuel , like the sporite and oil pricing for the importance .
Now , there 's a new , audace solution to use it .
Repower : 100 percent of clean energy , in 10 years .
A plan to reput America to work , make sure us more surance , and help stop the global warming .
Finally , a solution that basts solve our problems .
Repower . Scoprice more .
Al Gore : This is the last one .
Video : Comment : It 's about re-energy to America .
One of the fastest ways to bring it dependence from the combustible , that killing our planet .
Comparse : The future is here . Vent , a new energy network .
Nures : Nuovi investment for ben jobs for the jobs .
Comment : Repower . It 's time to be realists .
Al Gore : A old proverbio African says , " If you want to go fast , you go to fast .
If you want to go back , you go together . "
We have to go back , fast .
Thank you very much .
LHC . Last year , a TED introduction .
And promise to go back to how the machine works .
So here I was there . And for the ones that have no , the LHC is the biggest scientific experiment ever tried -- 27 kilometers of circumstoming .
His task is to reeing the conditions that were less than a billion billion times as a second in the universe -- until 600 million times a second .
That 's just ambitious .
This is the machine under Ginevra .
We 're going to take these min-Big Bang in the relevant .
This is what I work . It 's called ATLAS -- is large-footprint .
This is a spectacular picture of ATLAS in building this so you can see proportions .
Ten september last year , we have acceso the machine for the first time .
And this picture was taken by ATLAS .
It was because of immense festeggiving in control .
It 's a picture of the first particles that had done all the around the LHC , entering in collision , with a part of the LHC , and spread particles in the launch .
In other words , when we saw that image 10 september , we knew that the machine worked , which is a great writing writing .
I don 't know if this was an exultating us more or this , when somebody went on on Google and saw the pages that the starting began .
That means we have had a cultural impact over to the scientific impact .
About a week later , there was a problem with the machine , just to these file bles here -- these files .
These files are 13,000 leamping when the machine works at the massive .
Now , the technical technique of you will look at the file and say , " It 's not true . I 'm very sotremendous . "
And they can do it because when they 're very frequently , they 're going to be the superconcerned .
So , at least 271 degrees , at least 271 degrees , in the spring of the space between stars , these bles can bring that running that running .
In one of the giunture of the magneti magneti in the LHC , there was a fect defect of a phobrication .
So the file removed , and the 13,000 print suddenly met a electrical resistance .
This was the result .
Now , this is even more impressive if you think that these magneti fish more than 20 tons , and that have been moved about 30 initions .
There are about 50 magneti magneti .
We had to take them , what we did .
We 've restinated them and traveled .
Now they 're going back to all the subject to their place .
And then the end of the march the LHC is is going to be integral .
We 're going to access it , and we expect to get the data or the bunch or the bunch of data , and continue so our adventure to find what are the universe is .
Now , of course , in a certain way , these accidents reaccended the debate of science and engineering in front of science and engineering in front of science and engineering in front of the engineering . It 's easy to convictiate .
I think the fact that it 's so hard , the fact of going beyond the value of things like LHC .
I want to end with the words of a English scientists , Humphrey , which , I imagine , in defense of inuseful experiments of his pupille , his clello was Michael Faday , he said , " Nient is so much dangerous for progress of human mind how the required that the ideas of science is that not there are mysteries in nature , that our trilines are total . "
Thank you .
I want to start asking you to rethink of when , kids , play with children , playing with the horrise .
And as you can get them and get them to get them and get them to move them , and you can actually get them and have to be able to think and solve problems with and manipulating relationships .
The space reasoning is deep connected to the way we understand most most of the world around us .
So , as an inspired information of our interaction with physical objects , together to my consultant objects , and my collaborator Jeevan Kalanithi , I started asking , " And I started asking a computer , instead of having the only cursor of the mouse as a computer , instead of having the only one of the Cpastrat that it is about a desktop , we could actually make a scientist , with hands ,
and how do it to do that ?
The question was so interesting that we decided to explore the answer , building the Siftable .
In a few words , a Siftable is a great interactive computer as a biscoped .
In a few words , a Siftable is a great interactive computer as a biscoped .
You can move with them , they can see " between them , " You can see " between them , they 're going to hear their movement and a wireless .
But most importantly , they 're physical objects , like the morning , you can just move to be a grandandy .
Siftable is the example of a new ecosystem of instruments to manipulate digital information .
And as they become more physics , conscious , conscious of the movement , of other , and as they become more physics , conscious , of how we die , we can explore new and fun and different styles of interaction .
I 'll start with some simple example .
This Siftable is configured to show the video : if you put it in a direction , video is going to rotable , video rotable , if you cross-handback .
These interactive rits are conscious achieves .
If I 'm going to have them , they 're interested in what they 're around .
If they 're surrounded , they can see it and they can do a little bit .
If they 're surrounded , they can see it and they can do a little bit .
They also have their movement and inclination .
We then realized that one of the interesting implications of the interaction was to be able to use common data , to example , " a color like it was a liquid .
In this case , we have three Siftable configurate as a buck and I can use them to fix color in that central , where they 're mischieve .
and I can use it to the color in that central color , where they 're mischieve .
If we 're too too , we can put a little bit of place .
There are also beautiful possibility of apprentice , like language , mathematics and logic games where people can try to make things fast , and see the results immediately .
Now I 'm --
This is a Fibonaces that I do with a equations programming .
Here we have a words that 's a game of words that 's half in Scarabeo and Boble .
Pratically , at every Siftable , at every Siftable , Pratically , at every Siftable , Pratically , at every Siftable , and as certain of the Siftable , and as certain certain of the words control on a dictionary .
Then , after about 30 seconds remischieve , and you have a new leck set of reading and new possibility to try .
Thank you .
Here 's here here here , the children came to the Media Lab , I did so that I tried them and I went a video .
They 're very liked .
And one of the interesting things of this kind of application is that you don 't have to give people a lot of instructions .
You just say , " Compons of words , and they know exactly what to do .
Here 's here to other people who try it .
This is our younger tester header , there on the right .
It actually wanted to just impilling them .
They just were bringing in the morning .
Now , this is a appliation of a interactive charge .
We wanted to build a tool for the apprentice for the laws is Felix .
It can put the characters in the scene , and you can get the Siftable .
It can put the characters in the scene , and you can get the Siftable .
So , it 's doing the sun .
Video : The sun is smile .
David Merrill : Now , he took a treat the scene .
Video : The arange is the arange .
Bel work ! Yeah ! Yeah !
So , you know , the Siftable and put them close to interact with characters --
Video : Bau !
-- inventing your story .
Video : Hi !
DM : It 's a story with final open , and it can decide him how you want .
DM : It 's a story with final open , and it can decide him how you want .
Video : From , that the right .
DM : The last example I have the time to show you is a tool , recently made of recently , to campioning and executive music .
It 's a tool , recently , to the campioning and make music .
The Siftable here are running from sound like basic , and bacteria .
Each of these has four different variations , and you can choose what to use .
You can also put these sound in a sequence that you can compories .
And you can just make a fairly , you know , " and a sequence . "
These are actually actually that you can control from the vial , like reverberbation and filter .
The attacks to a particular sound and then inclessly to enables .
And then there are the general effects as time and volume , which apply to the sequence .
Let 's look at how it works .
Video : We 're going to start with a by-sequence in two Siftable sequence , we put them in a series , we add the extend , we add the other base .
Now I put a basis of the lower line .
Video : I add the percussions --
Video : And now put the filter to the bacteria , so I can control the effect from the live effect .
Video : I can be able to be able to be able to fire the whole sequence of a time from one side or another .
Video : And now I 'm going to add the bottom to give more expression .
Video : I can recombine the sequence of the sequence .
So I don 't have to plan it before , but I can improvisate , making it longer or the corner .
And now , finally , I can spend the whole sequence on the left , the Siftable on the left Siftable .
Thank you .
So , you can see , my passion is to build new mo-machine interfacuation more and more sounds like our brain and body .
And today , I had time to show you one of the results of this path , and even some chance we try to bring out of the lab .
The concept I want to transmit is that 's coming to this new generation of designed to interact with digital media , which will bring information in our world in the way that we want .
Thank you very much .
I don 't see the time to talk to all of you .
I 'm a writer .
I 'm going to cross books is my profession , but it 's more than this , of course .
It 's also love and the fascination of my life .
And I don 't expect to change .
But , said this , something particular happened to my life , which is actually success to my life and my career , which has led me to reflew me to get the whole work with this work .
The particular thing is that I recently written this book , this biography called " Mangia , Prega , " which , " The diversly from my precedented books , for some reason used in the world and became a great , and it became a great feational , and it became a great feelational feature ,
And the result is that everywhere is now , people treat me as if I were convicted .
It 's true -- convicted , convicted .
They 're all going to be worried and they say , " Do you can 't do any more than doing ?
Do you have no fear to continue to write for all life without being able to create a book that can importance to someone ? "
that can be importantly to someone ? "
It 's certainly , you know .
But it could go worse , part of the one remembers , I remember that over 20 years ago , when I started saying , I was a adolescent -- I wanted to be a writer .
I was in the same reaction based from fear .
And people said , " Don 't you could have success ?
Do you have no fear that the umiliation of killed you ?
Do you have this fear to writing for all life without nothing nothing about there , and they die on a mulo of a mulo of infrants with the mouth of ading hilling to adn core hiling dlife ? "
So , you know .
The answer -- the answer to all these questions is , " Yes . "
Yeah , I 'm afraid of all those things .
I always had fear .
And I 'm also fear of the other things that people can 't have .
As the algae and other spent things .
But , for how I thought I 'd write what I thought and I 'd ask myself , I 'd ask me , is why ?
Is it rational ?
It 's logical that anybody had to wait to be spented by a job that you 've been born to do .
But what is so particular in the creative impressive , to make us nervous , is it about the mental health care of the other career don 't do ?
How my father , for example , he was a chemical engineer and I don 't remember one time in his 40 years of activities that he had been asked if he had fear to be engineer ?
There was never -- that blogging John , John , how does it go ?
It didn 't work so much , right ?
Onestly , chemicals like they don 't have any of them , in the centuries , falled the reputation of being alcolized .
We have a writers , we have enough to do this reputation , and not just writers , but you have this reputation of being enormous mentally unstable .
And it 's not about the other than looking at the sad of the magnificments of the magnificments that , only in the 2th century , they die young , they die young people .
And even the ones that don 't suicide sound to be really disfaced by their dones .
Norman Mailer , before he died , in the last interview said , " Every book , my book killed me a little more " an extraordinary affermonstration about the work of their life .
But we don 't buy the bitch , when we heard these things so long that in some way we 've completely interiorized and accepted the notion that creativity and suffering are in some way to the ceiling , and that art , at the end , it will always contain the analysis .
And the question I want to bring all of the today is : Are you agree with this idea ?
You know this thing -- because it also looked at this thing -- because it 's also not good for this supposition .
I think it 's hated .
And I think it 's also dangerous and I don 't want to see perpetuated the next century .
I think it 's better to encourage our big creative minds .
And I surely , I know , in my case -- it would be very dangerous to start fuse to the ball of suppointing out of the supped of the circumstances that I 'm in my career .
That 's what -- I mean , you know , I 'm pretty young , I have about 40 years .
I 've got about four work decades of work in me .
And it 's very likely that anything I written in the world , and then it 's going to be judged after the success of my last book .
I 'm going to be slavery , because we 're all more or less friends here -- is likely my big success is to my shoulder .
Oh , Gesus , who thought !
You know this is the kind of thought that leads a person starting to start bing nine of the nine of the morning and I don 't want to do it .
I 'm going to keep doing this work that I love .
So , the question becomes , how ?
And so I think , after many reflective , which the way to work to continue to be writing is to create a psychological psychical , OK ?
I have to find a way of security between me , which I 'm writing , and my natural anxime about what the written is going to get back to the time , looking for all last year , looking at the time , trying to find other society to see if they could have to be able to find other society to see if they could have more and more healthy ideas to see if they could have more more and more healthy ideas to see if they could have more ideas have more and more healthy ideas to see ideas to see that ,
about how to help people manage to manage emotivity .
And that research has taken me to the Grek and ancient Rome .
I 'm going to go back to the circle and then back .
In the ancient Grek and ancient Rome -- people didn 't seem to believe that creativity self-invent men , OK ?
And it was thinking about creativity was this spirit , and that came to men from a few distant source and unknown , for a few distant source and known , for distant reasons .
The green demand called these spirites of creativity demons .
Socrate , wonderful , wonderful , created to have a load that elareas from a distant wisdom from a distant wisdom .
The Roomes were the same idea , but they called the " kind of spirit without a genyum .
which is great , because the Rooms didn 't really think that a genius was a particularly intelligent .
They thought that a genius was this kind of divine entity that was really in the walls of a study of a past , a little bit like the elpho Dobby , and that was out to have to be able to see the work of the areas of artist , and the result of the job of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the argument .
Here 's -- this is the distance of which is the distance of which I 'm talking about -- that costruct psychological constructed from your work .
And everyone knew that was how it worked , right ?
So , the anti-artists were protected by certain things , like , for example , too much narcible , right ?
If your work was exceptional , you couldn 't get all the deserve , you know that the people had been helped by this genius to have been helped by this genius .
If your failed work , it was not all your himself , it was not all your himself ,
Everybody knew that was your genius to be an inable .
And so people han conceived creativity in Occient for a long time .
Then the Rensaving came and all of this big idea ; we put it out of the universe on the universe over the universe on the universe over the universe over the universe over the universe on the writing of the universe , the mysteries that writing from divinity .
This was the practice of humans and people begin to think that creativity came out of the ililightened by the ilight-rational principle .
And for the first time in history , you start refly to this or artist as a genius rather than a person with a genius .
And I have to tell you , I think it was a big mistakes .
I think I allow someone , a simple person to believe that being a recipient of being as a recipient source , creativity , and the source of all the mysteries , creatives , unknown as a very big file to give to a file physical ,
It 's how to ask someone to enjoy the sun .
Deform and destores completely completely , ego and creates all these things expectations on performance .
And I think it was this pressure that I have been destroyed in 500 years .
And , if this is true , and I think that 's the question becomes , and now ?
Can we do that diversity ?
Maybe return to a more adantical comprehension of human relationship between human and mystery .
Or maybe not .
Maybe we can 't cell 500 years of rational thinking in a 18 minutes .
And there 's people among the audience that would have the public suspect of the scientific news on the news , they 're doing that they follow people in the next people spent on their projects .
I 'm not going to convince you all about this thing .
But the question I 'd like to bring is -- why isn 't no ?
Why don 't you think about this way ?
Because it 's more sense of everything that ever ever heard of the most explanation of creative process .
A process that , as anybody ever ever tried to do something -- so , basically , all here -- you don 't know , you know , you don 't compories rationally .
And , in fact , it can sometimes seem completely paranormous .
I did this meeting recently with the extraordinary poetry Ruth Stone , who has 90 years , but he was a poeter for all life and said that during his infant in the rural Virginia , worked out in the camps , and he felt , in if a poetry , when a poetry came from the landscape .
He said it was like a fragorous train .
And that was rotolating to her from the landscape .
He felt it , because he was doing it so he was going to tremendous .
He knew I had one thing to do that point and was , her , her running as a matter . "
And so he would correct home and he was slow from this poetry , and he wouldn 't have any other than taking a piece of card and a pretty quickly fast as the trap , and he collect it , and they were standing on the page .
Sometimes he couldn 't be enough to be fast enough , so it was correcreceive and correcrecreceive to the house and the rotolar the rotolar , and she had the rotolar and he kept through the landscape , looking for , how she said , " another poet . "
Then there were those times -- this piece of time , I never forget -- there were moments where the was almost losing , OK ?
So , he was running home and he was looking for card and the poetry was going through , and he was a major in the way that was passing , and then said , which was how if you get away with the other hand and the steffule .
He was a poetry from the coda and remamajor his body and he was cared it on the page .
And in these cases , the poetry would have presented on the perfect page and intact but the contrary , the last word to the first .
So when I heard it -- it 's crazy , it 's exactly the same same same thing .
Not all my creative process -- I 'm not a conconvict !
I 'm a mulo , and my way to work is ; you know , you know , you know , I 'm going to play and work on the goal .
But even I , in my head-shaped head-screen against that thing , sometimes .
And I guess that many of you have made .
You know , even though the work and ideas came out of a certain source , you can 't honestly safe .
And what is this thing ?
And how can we relate to it in a way that you don 't lose your head , but rather , what does it remain healthy ?
And as I 'm about , the best example I have is the musician I have is the musician , which I 've interviewed different years ago for a day .
We were talking about this , and you know , Tom , for the majority of life was the incarnation of the incarnation of the incarnation of the incarnation of the most impulents .
But then he invent , he calculate , and one day , as he was driving on a road in Los Angeles , and changed all for him .
He was going to fast and fast traat this little framework , which is in his head as inspiration , which comes in his head as inspiration , elusive , and the wants , you know , it 's wonderful , and it 's really wonderful , and the desider , but it doesn 't know how to take it .
It 's not a piece of paper , it didn 't have a matt registrator .
So he started to hear this species of old old old old , " I 'm going to lose , " I 'm going to lose , and I 'm going to remarked from this song , and I 'm going to remain with this song ,
I 'm not good enough and I can 't do it . "
And instead of going to go to the panic , he stopped .
And he took the whole mental process and made something completely new .
And he just just the sky and said , " Scell , I don 't see that I 'm driving ? "
" Do it seem to write a song ? "
If you really want to exist , you get a more opporting moment when I can take care of you .
Other , you go to importantly qualcut out of today .
I got Leonard Cohen . "
And his process changed after this .
Not work , the work was still dark .
But the process , and the fish anxiety that was releft was releft when he took the genius , the genius that was a genius that was caused to be remained the other things that was going to get it back from where it was , realized that it didn 't have to be a whole thing and remainly remajor .
but you can have this peculiar , wonderful bizarre collaboration between Tom and this strange and this strange and outside that was Tom .
So , as I heard that story started to change a little bit even the way I worked and save me a time .
This idea , I 'm going to save me when I was writing , Prega , Ama , and fall in one of those cave the disperation that we all have when we 're working on something and we can 't start thinking about something and we can 't think that it will be a disaster , which is going to be a disaster , which is going to be writing .
Not just bad , right , the worst book written .
And I started thinking about to throw this project .
But then I remind to Tom that I was talking about the air and I tried to you .
So I went up to my face on the wild , and I was committed my common a vacuum of room .
And I said to a high voices , " Sort , what , you know , both we know that if this book is not going to be brilliant not going to be brilliant , no ?
Because I 'm going to see it all I have , I don 't have any more than this .
So if you want to be better , you have to present you and do your part .
OK . But if you don 't do it , you know what , I don 't do anything .
I 'm going to write the same because it 's my work .
And I 'd like to favor that was recorded that I 've presented to do my part of " Because -- at the end is so , OK -- they 're in the deserts of the North Africa was actually dunges to the drugs of the moon , the music that was going on and sacred and the houses that went on to the dalba .
And they were always magnification , because the ballers were professionals and they were great .
But every single one of these artists became a lot of the artists became transcending .
And I know what I 'm talking about , because I know you 've all seen , at a performance so .
It was like the time , and the dancer walking through a kind of land-axis , and it was not doing anything else from the solutterly , as 1,000 night before , but all was all all all the .
And suddenly , not just like a human .
But it 's accese from the divinity of divinity .
And when this happened , when this happened , the time , the people knew what was called him .
They were going to kill their hands and begin to doctor , " Allah , God , God , " God , " God , God , " God , "
That 's God , you know .
Curious note -- historic Minvaded the Spain , I was this abitude with them and pronounded it and the prefer changed in the centuries from " Allah , Allah , " The Ole , " the ones , " which you can still feel in the corries or the flamp .
In Spain , when a artist did something impossible and magical , " Allah , " Allah , " Allah , " uncomprehensible , " incomprehrensible , that 's a last of God .
And it 's great because we need .
But , the problem comes the day , the dancer itself , when you ssnake and discover that are the 11 in the morning of Martedesday and the last of God 's morning and the last of God 's morning , there 's no longer .
It 's just a big mortal with gran bad bad , and maybe it 's not going to get more to sell down to that height .
And maybe nobody will you have the name of God , and what does it have to do with the rest of his life ?
It 's hard .
This is one of the most paorous recognizations to make in a creative life .
But maybe it doesn 't have to be so much as you can 't believe , moved , which is most extraordinary aspects of your being being being from yourself .
But you know , you can just prested from a inimaginable source of this team that you have to go to someone else when you finished .
And , you know , if we think that 's all changes .
And so I started thinking about , and it 's certainly how I thought I was several several months during the working on the book , the dangerous , the dangerous , attesissue , the dangerous success .
And what I have to continue to tell me when I feel elated by this is , it 's not not fear .
Not just just to your work .
Continua presentation of your side , any can be .
If your work is dancing , balling .
If the divine , I 'm assurd to you assigned by leave a few kind of wonderful , for one moment through your efforts , then , " Ole ! "
Other , you do the same dance .
" Ole ! " You know , you know , you know , " You know .
I think , and I think it 's got to teach it .
" Ole ! " at you , even just for human love and testing tack-head-lining tals to make you continue .
Thank you .
Thank you .
June Cohen : Ole !
As I 've already talked about some of these projects on the human genes , what can mean and what it can mean and the discovery of new set of genes .
Now we 're starting a new persual path : we started to digitize biology and now we 're going into a new phase of biology , designing and design synthize .
We always tried to ask big questions .
" What is life ? " is something that many biologists have tried to understand vary vary vary .
We tried different approaches , reduced it to the minims .
We 're digitializing by almost 20 years .
When we sequenced the human genome was about to spend from the analome of the world 's biology in the digital world .
Now , we can regenerate life , or create new life from this universe ?
This is the map of a small organism , Mycoplasma genitalium , which is the smallest genitalium between those who can authorean .
And we tried to reduce ulteriorly to create a little bit more .
We can eliminate a hundred genes of genes of about 500 .
But when we look at his focus on metabolic metabolic map , it 's relatively simple respect to our .
I think , this is simple .
But when we look at all the genes that we can eliminate , once it 's very unlikely that this can bring to a living cells .
So we decided that the only way to progree was synthetize this chromosoma in a way to get to get some of these fundamental questions .
And so we started the adventure of the " can we synthesize a chromosoma ? "
Can you can 't get these big molecules that we never had to create these big molecules that we never had to create before ?
And in case of affermative , can we make a chromosoma ?
A chromosoon is just a piece of inert material .
The speed that we 're going to be able to digitize life is growing up to exponential .
Our ability to write genetic code , instead , procreative , rather slowly , but it 's improving .
And our most recent results are going to take exponential curve .
We 've been more about 15 years ago .
The process required many steps , starting with biothetic review before we began to start with biothic required .
But we found that synthesize DNA is very difficult .
There are tens of thousands of cars in the world that make little segments of DNA , long , long , , long , and it 's a degenerative process : the most of the segment is longer , the mistakes are .
So we had to develop a new method to assemble these framments and correcrecreceive the mistakes .
And this was our first attempt , to start digital information of the genome of the genome of Phi X 174 .
It 's a little virus that kills bacteria .
We 've designed the fragments , effectively the correction of the errors and get a molecule of DNA molecule .
The interesting part is when we 've taken this piece of inert chemical material insert and we put it in the bacteria , the bacteria have started reading this genetic code and produring the viral particles .
The viral particles have then been released by the cells , they 've come back and they destroyed Ecles .
I talked about recent membranes of the oil industry is saying that they 're certainly compresed this model .
They have reported more than you .
We think this is a situation where the software can really build its own hardware in a biological system .
But we wanted to do things bigger .
We wanted to build the entire chromosoma .
I 'm over 580 mile thousand lettes .
So we thought we build it in the cassets of the virus , so that we can change the cassets that we can change the cassets of a living cells .
The design is crucial , and if we start with digital information in a computer , these have to be very accurate .
When we sequenced this genome for the first time in 1995 accurategy was a mistakes for every 10 miles .
We found that , we found it , 30 errors . If we had that original sequence , we didn 't have been able to do it work .
One part of the process is designing over 50 lecking that they 're going to be a lot of himself with all the other segments of 50 lettes to build underwater smaller than working together .
We try to unique elements here .
You probably have read that we 're going to read that we 're in the shake .
So we think about this : we have a genetic code on four letters : Actually , C , Gs and T.
Three of those letters together with the codificate about 20 amminodification , and there 's a specific order to read for every friend .
So we can use genetic code to write words , thoughts .
What we 've done is to do it .
Some of them were delusers from the fact that it was not poetry .
We designed these segments to just uning them up with the enzymes .
There are no lifetime and put them on them .
And we started assemble with the parts , starting with segments from five to seven milettles , unending them in a way to form segments in their own time to get 72 mile mile .
And we 've made these segments in abundance so that we can sequence them out that we 're trying to create an extremely robby-robbust -- how you see in a minute .
We 're trying to automatize the process .
So , this seems the tabellone of the loket .
When we get these very long segments , more than 100 miles , they 're not going to grow more directly in the E.
It comes to the modern instruments of the modern biology .
So we 've been considered other mechanisms .
We knew about another mechanism called recombination omologa , which in biology is uliity to repair the DNA to unning segments .
Here 's one example .
This organism , called Deinococcus radiodurans , can absorb three million radiation .
You can see in the superior as his chromosoft is destroyed .
In 12 -- 24 hours comes riassemble exactly how it was before .
There are thousands of organisms that are able to do it .
These organisms can sit completely .
They can live under vacuum .
I 'm absolutely sure life there is life in space , and you feel to find new environments of water .
And the true , NASA showed that this is .
This is a picture of the molecule that we built using these processes , just using the lievision of the segments that we 're using the design of appropriate design segments .
The lights assemble le is self-assemble .
This picture was not taken with a microscope electronic microscope , but with a microscope .
It 's a big molecule that we can see it with a law microscope .
These are photos that are made a period of about six seconds .
This is the adveration that we 've done a little time ago .
I 'm over 580,000 lettes of genetic code .
It 's the largest molecule of a defined structure ever created by man .
It 's got a lot of the weight to 300 million .
If you stamp it with a 10 without spaces , you 'd like 142 pages , it would just have to transcer this code .
Now , how do we do it work ? How can we activate it ?
Of course , we have a virus is a game .
It 's a little bit more complicated when they use bacteria .
It 's simpler , even when it 's eucariote like our : you can just extract the nucleus and put another , which is practice and put another , which is practice process .
In the bacteria , the bacteria is instead of integrated in the cells , but we 've been demonstrated that we 're able to do a complete trapieces of a cell birthday to another cells to another cell and a cell of another , and to activate it .
We clean a chromosoma by a microbial species .
The two are different as men from the topes .
We 've added some genes more so that we can decide what to choose for this chromosoma .
And then , he skip with the enables so that you can kill all the proteins .
And when we put it in the cells was study -- and you will appreciate our sophisticatomic graphics -- the new chromosophisticatome -- the new chromosoma is in the cells .
And we started thinking that we couldn 't go beyond , but we tried so much to spingeres in there .
This is one of the major mechanisms .
We found that a lot of species have added species have added in a second , or a third crumosome from a second thousand new tracts to the species .
So who think about evolution as only as a only gene and the time it didn 't understand a lot of the biology .
They 're called the restriction that they 're going to be a restriction that they 're going to type the DNA .
The chromosoma that was in the cells that didn 't have one .
The cell phone , the cell phone that we have inserit--shapes .
It 's expressed , and it recognized the other expressed chromosoma , the masticated , and we 've been found with only the cells and the new chromosoma .
It became blue because of the genes we 've inserted .
And in a short leverversus of time , all the characteristics of a species , went through all in a new species , based on the new software that we have inserted in the cells .
All the protections have changed , the member of the protection changed , and when we read the genetic code is exactly what we have transfted .
Now , this might seem genetic alchemy genetic , but altering the software , we can change things very , very , fundamental .
Now , I 've already explained that this is not about genesesis -- but progress from three million years and a half million evolution , and I said that maybe we 're going to create a new version of Cambrian explosion that will be created new species on this process .
Why do that ?
I think it 's pretty obvious when we think about our needs .
We 're going to move from six billion and a half billion people in the next 40 years .
Right for example , I was born in 1946 .
Now there are three people on the planet for each existing in 1946 .
We 're having problems now to find food , fresh water and clean , medicine and gas for six billion and a half billion people .
It 's going to be more hard to do it for nine billion .
We use more than five billion carbon dioxide , more than 30 billion baries .
That means a hundred million baries a day .
When we try to find biologists , or any kind of process to repair them , it will be a huge challenge .
We have to keep the whole heat of the CO2 hemisphere from these materials that 's going to be in the atmosphere .
And at the day , because of the scientific discoveries in the world , we have a database with about 20 million genes , and I like to think they are the design components for the future .
The electronics is only one dozen of components , and think about how many different things are coming out .
Our limits are data here , principles of the reality and our imagination .
Now we have a techniques , because of these rapid methods , able to create what we call a combinatory genomics .
We can build a big robot that can produce a big robot that can produce a million chromosomes a day .
Think about these 20 million genes are different genes or to try to optimize the processes to produce either or drug , new vaccines , we can change , thank you to create more biology now that in the last 20 years of science .
And it 's just a standard selection .
We can choose for survival , chemical production or fuel or carburant , production , or fuel production .
This is a instantanea of some software programming that we 're working on that we 're working to be able to be able to sit us and designing species to computer .
Well , we don 't know how they will it be .
We know exactly how their genetic code .
Now we 're focusing on the quarter generation .
You 've also seen you that extract ethanol was a bad experiment .
We have a second second and third generation of the second generation that are going to be in high valuable than the sugar or different kinds of butanol .
But the only way that biology can have a big impact without increase the cost of food and limitaren the cost of food and limitarne availability to transform CO2 in matter before , which we 're working on design cells that can reach this to the purpose , and we think we can have the first carburant first generation in about 18 months .
The solar light with CO2 is a metodo-- but in our discoveries all over the world , we found different metods .
This is a organism that we 've described in 1996 .
I live in the deep ocean , about 2,500 feet of the deep in the ocean temperature .
They create a meter from CO2 using hydrogen molecular as a source of energy .
We 're trying to understand if we can incanalate CO2 , which can easily be translated tramed to be carry that CO2 in the CO2 in the carburant , to drive this process .
So , we think we could be able to increase what we could be able to increase what the basic question is , " that 's a big , greater , we have the goal of repair the whole oil industry .
Exactly . If you can 't do that from TED , where you can ?
It would be a main of energy source .
And also , we 're working for using the same metods to create instantane-wish vaccines .
You 've seen this year with flu , we always go back to a year and with a dollar in when it 's about to find the right vaccine .
I think what you can change building vaccines in ancient advaccines .
Here 's how the future could start to look at the time , the tree of evolution , accelerating evolution with synthetic bacteria , archy , and initially cell cell , areas .
We 're so at the improving people .
Our purpose is to do a long way of living enough to try to do it . Thank you very much .
First of all , I 'll show you , the earest , a few fundamental work , the new technology that we 've taken to Microsoft , following a year ago . This is Seadragon .
It 's a environment that you can interact is in the local level that you can interact with a huge amount of data .
Here we 're seeing a lot of gigabyte digital phoom with a kind of expensive phoom , and I have the picture of a panoramic fast , aving the images like we want .
And it doesn 't matter how big the amount of information that we see , how big the amount of data or images .
Most are common photographs , but this for example is a scanning scanning from the Library of Congress , and recenter in the gamel of 300 megax-megapile .
It doesn 't make a difference because the only thing that limits that limits of a system like this is the number of pixel on your screen in any time . It 's also a very flexible architecture .
This is a book , interior example of data not images .
This is the Casa desolate of Dickens . Every colonna represents a caple .
To show you that it 's just about text and not images , we can do something like that , to actually see that it 's a real representation of the text , not a picture .
It could be a little artificial way to read a writing electronic book .
Not about advice .
This is a matheists . It 's a number of the Loooden .
Every picture is the beginning of a sex-section .
And it really gives you the please of reading the version of reading version version of a magazine , or a quotidian , which is for a molteplant , which is for a molteplicy .
We 've also done something with the angle of the Lardian .
We 've created a higher advertising ads -- much higher than what you use in a normal advertising ads -- and we 've put an extra content .
If you want to see the characteristics of this car , you can see here .
Or other models , or even the techniques .
And this really shows some of these ideas to eliminate the limits of space on the screen .
We hope that that means to put it in the p-up , and other porcheries , and more similar , you don 't have to be necessary .
Of course , the map is one of the most obvious applications for this kind of technology .
And I don 't want to lose time , if I don 't say that we have contribute to give them this field .
These are all the streets in the United States , I 'm going to put a NASA geospy-like picture .
So , we 're going to go to something else .
This is actually actually the face of the Web ; you can go to see it .
This is a project called Photosynthetic , which combine two different technologies .
One is Seadragon and the other is a very interesting visual computer research that was made by Noah Snavely , a student at the University of Washington , with Steve Seitz of UW Szeliski , Rick Szeliski of Microsoft Rick . Szeliski collaboration .
And it 's from the Web , managon by Seadragon .
You can see this when we do this type of pattern , which we can move from one image to the other picture and have this kind of experience , and have this kind of experience .
But the location of the images here actually has a meaningful .
The algorithms of the computer visualization have been recorded these images together , so that they have all been related to the real places that I 've got them on the head of them -- all the close to the Grasis on Montagne Rockies -- have been taken . Here you see the elements of a de-to-show , and these things are all been related to the spaces of a de-show , and these things are all been related to the space .
I don 't know if I have time to show you some other environment .
There are some much more space .
I want to move directly to one of the original data of Noah-- and this comes from a previous prototype of Photosynthesis that we 've done for the first time , to show you what I think is really the key key to show you what I think is really the key key to show you what I think is really the key key to show you what we put in the website .
We had to have to worry about legal aspects and on .
This is a re-building re-building of Notre Dame images from Flickr . Bao digitore Notre Dame , Flickr and you get images of types in magic , other campus and you get images of a picture that is that it is discovery .
So they 're all images from Flickr and they 're all related to this way .
And it 's possible to navigate this very simple way .
You know , I never thought I would end to work for Microsoft .
It 's very gratificent to get this kind of acastic acastic accooking here .
I think you can see that it 's a lot of different type of photos : from the cell phones to those of the SLR , a number significant number meaningful , put together in this environment .
And if I can , I try to look for those strange .
Many are stuck by faces , etc .
Somewhere you find a series of photographs -- it 's a series of .
This is a poster of Notre Dame registrate .
We can go from the poster to the physics of this environment .
The essential point is that we can do things with social environment . This is now taking data from the whole memory of how -- the whole collective memory of how it looks like the Earth , from the sidiculty , and connected all those data together .
All those pictures become connected together , larger than the subject .
You have a model of land .
Think about this as to the work of Stephen Lawler on Earth 's work .
It 's something that grows in complexity as people use it , and the advantages to get them to be increase with use .
Their pictures are hushed with other people .
If somebody comes the idea of contrassigning all these sorts of said , my picture of Notre Do suddenly arriculous , in the metaphors of all those data , and I can use how to use it as a point of a space , in that metapuniverse , using the picture of the universe , using the picture of a little bit of a social experience .
Of course , a consequence of all this is extract virtual models of every interesting part of the land , collected not just from alive and satellitaries and similar images and similar images , but from the memory memory .
Thank you .
Chris Anderson : I understand ? What your software is that your software is to us to do is that at a certain point , in the next few years , all the years , all shared the whole picture of everyone in the entire world will be practically related to ?
BAA : Yeah . That 's what he 's doing is to find out .
It 's creating perlink , if you want , you want , you know , you want to be in images .
And it 's doing it in the bottom of the images .
The thing is really interesting if you think about wealth of semantic information that many of these images are actually edge .
As you have a research research on the Web , you digit a frase and the text on the web page has a lot of information about the picture .
Now , what happens if that picture is you 're going to get all of your picture ?
So the amount of interconnection , semantics and the amount of wealth that it is really enormous . It 's a classic effect of the network .
CA : Blaise , it 's really incredible . Compedents .
BAA : Thank you very much .
One of the most main pleasure , when you travel and one of the thanks of the thanks of the thanks of the people who have no forgotten the antial traditions , between the wind , you touch it in the wind , you touch it in the wind the plants of the plants .
Bastes think that the sciamans Jaguar vide still over the Lattea , or that the monitites Inuit are still recollied with meanthropology , or in Himalaya , the buddists still in the respire of the Dharma , but to remind the central importance of the world , we live in there , but it 's not in absolute , but it 's just a model , but it 's just a model , but it 's just a model ,
the consequence of a particular adaptative choices that our stropes did , well , many generations do .
And , of course , we all share the tracts .
We all procreates .
We are subjects to start .
We have to deal with the inexorability of death , so we don 't surprise us if we 're going to get and we balance --
We all have a art .
What it is the rhythm particular song , the rhythm of the dance of every culture .
It doesn 't matter that 's the Penan forests of Borneo , or the following Vodoo 's Haiti , or the deserved of Kenya , or the desert Kenya , or a camererries in the Sahara .
He was my company in the desert a month ago , or a month ago , or a yak of yak in the desert of the Clma , on the Everest , the dea mother of the world .
All these populations teaches us that are other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , other ways of moving in the world .
And if you think you think a bad thing .
To you , together , the myriades of the world create a spiritual of spiritual life and the world is important to the well-being of the planet and it 's important to the well-being as a biosphere .
And you can think of this rague , as a cultural ragnating , and you can defining the etnosphere , and you can defining the sum the whole whole concepts of human imagination from the alba of human imagination from the alba of human imagination from the alba of the consciousness .
The etnosphere is the fantastic patriage of humanity .
It 's the symbbol of what we are and what we can be as a very inquisitive .
And because the biosphere was gravly consumed alured as well as a very rapidly consumed as as fast .
Nothing about biologist , for example , that would say that 50 percent of all species was or is on the orders just because it 's father , or -- in the most apocalcalcalyptic -- in the majority of biological diversity -- and you don 't even even even even get close to the most optimistic -- that 's not even close to the most optimistic issue .
The index of that is , of course , the language loss .
When you were born 6,000 language on this planet .
A language is not only composal by a vocabulary or a series of rules .
A language is the sprayed of human spirit .
It 's the half of the animation of every culture is in the material world .
Every language is a forest of mind , a backin , a thought , a spiritual possibility of spiritual possibility .
And of those 6,000 language , as we are in Monterey , at least half the way it 's not ssurred in in the ears orecchies of children .
They 're not teaching kids , the people who don 't have something that 's not not trust , which are already death .
What is there more sad than being aved silence , of being the last to talk about a language , the way to talk a language , the way to talk to a language , you know , you know , you know , the promise of the children ?
This is a faced in somebody in the world every two weeks , every two weeks , every two weeks a old old one weeks , a old old old old old and door with the tiny syllabc language .
And I know somebody who will say , " isn 't it much better ?
The world would not be a better place if we 're all talking about all the same language ? " Benissim , then we talk all talk about the dotonese . We talk about the dotonese .
Let 's go kogs .
You 're going to have a tract thing that means not to talk about your language .
I 'd like to do a trip through the thnosphere ,
a little trip in the etnosphere to give you a hip of what we 're losing .
Many of us forget that when I say , " different ways of exists , " I mean , " I mean different ways of exists . "
We take for example this baby Barasana , in Amazon the slatest , the population of anaconda , which creates the myth to provent from the sandwest of slats in the west of the slatest slats .
It 's a population that is not able to distinguish color from the green green because the time you were identified in the forest , which depends is identified in the forest , which depends the population .
They have a strange language and a major major a major language , " You have to marries a different language .
And all of this has radical past mitologic , the particularity is that in these exese families where they 're talking about six or seven language because of marries , no one language .
They 're going to hear and then start talking about .
We take one of the most interesting tribes that I lived , the Waorans of the Waorans of Ecuador north , an incredible population that had the first contacts in 1958 .
In 1957 , five missionaries have been trying to make a factory mistakes .
They did the photographs that they were reached to the top of the back that they were reaching that this population of the population forest that this population of pluvial forest had never seen anything bi-size .
They collected the picture from the ground , they 've been shown them to the research of a form or a shape and , not finding anything , they had the concluded that was the hell , and they killed the five missionaries with lance .
But Waorans didn 't kill the strange .
They killed them between them .
54 percent of the mortality was caused by their own .
We are eight generations and we found two major cases of natural death and when we 've reached to know , they had a lot of them was invecently so he died , and then they killed him him him .
The hunters were able to recognize the animal of 40 steps and recognize the species .
In the first ' 80s , I 've been assigned a really interesting task when my professor of Harvard , if I wanted to go to Harvard , if I wanted to go to Haiti to the base of the power of Duvalier and Tonton Macoutes and Tonton Macoutes and Tonton Macoutes to make the fast babs .
To give a sense of the miracologist , I should understand the Vodoo culture is not magic .
It 's pretty much about a complex metaphor vision of the world .
Very interesting .
If I ask you to tell me the big religions of the world , what would you say ?
Cristianesimum , Islam , Buddism , Ebraism , etc .
A continent is always left out , thinking that the sub-Saharan Africa has no religious feeds . And they 're yes and Vodoo is not the other that the distilside of these religious concepts in the tragic concepts of the schiavails .
What makes the interesting voodoo is the intended internal relationship between life and death .
So , you know , they 're going to be hiking the spirites .
The spirites can be invoced by the Great Acqua , they respond to the rhythm of the dance and they replace at the time , and they replace the way that for a short kind of active the follows becomes the becomes to the becomes the becomes to the becomes to .
So , for this voodooists , you go to a church of God .
We give them in the time and we divate God . "
And since you 're married , is it spirit that you get you , how can you do it ?
So you have these incredible events : follow voodoo in the state of trance that touch hold them to be a very strong demonstration of the power of mind when it 's catalyzed in a state of extreme ,
Everyone of the population I lived the most extraordinary Kogi of Sierra Nevada Santa Marta , in the Colombia , in the Santa Marta Marta , in the Colombia .
It was scending of the ancient civilization that once they were living on the caraibic planes of the Colombia in the conquentioned of the vulcanic massive , which is the people were on the vulcanic planes that are treated on the charge of charge .
In a continent macked in a continent macked , this population has never been conquisted by the Spanish .
But now they 're governed by a clay , but their formation is so extraordinary .
The young people follows are taken by the families to three or four years , and live sat at a world that 's made of buy and shadow in a world that 's made of a little pieter at the base of the ice for 18 years .
Two doubs nine years of proposing to reproduce the nine months of management that translation spend in the ushorically metaphor in the ushhorically .
For all this time , they 're acculturate to their society , values that predict their prayers that make their prayers and only their prayers are keeping the cosmic equilibrium -- or to better , to say the ecological equilibrio .
At the term of this incredible initiation , they 're suddenly taken out and for the first time in their 18 years , they see a talba . And in that active , the respair , when the sun is the value of the first bunch of beautiful block , everything that they 've learned in theory . The first one of his spluted . The prey one of his splendor . The prete a step of the first .
" I said , " I 'm going to tell you .
It 's amazing . Now it 's about you protecting it . "
They call the major brothers and say that we , the minoring brothers , we are the collipaired of destroy .
This level of intuition is extremely important .
When we think about the Ingence and the environment invote Rousseau and the old story of the noble noble , which is a razer concept in its simplicity , which is a razoreau and we love that these populations are closer to Earth .
The population of the population is not indebolites from the nostalues .
There 's no space for these things in the malarithal palues , or in the winds of Tibet , but thank you for time and rate , they created a mystics of Earth , they 've made a mystics of the Earth is not not concept of the neighbor that the Earth can live only because it 's infused by conscious conscious , the concept that Earth can live only because it 's infused by consciousness .
What does it mean ?
It means that a little boy of Ande who grow up the mountain is a spirit of Apu that will leave his destiny . It 's going to be a very different human being human being deeply different , and it will have a very different relationship with the mountain that place to a mountain different rocks that the mountain of rocks is a mass of rocks that a mass is a mass of rocks .
That 's the dimap of a spirit or a mineral cuts is irrelevant .
What 's interesting is the metaphor that defines the relationship between the individual and the natural world .
I grew up in the forests of the British Columbia credating that forests to be cut .
That has made me a human being different from my friends Kwautl who believe that the forests are the Hukuk and the bis histored of the paradise and the bis histored and the batch of the paradise of the world , spirites that are in the Hatsa .
If you start to consider that these cultures can create different reality , you can start to understand some of their own feelings . We take this plant .
I 've taken this picture to open up in the nordocctor .
Mayahuash , some of you 've heard about ayahuash , the most powerful psychoppsychoppsychoppsychopping .
What makes it fascinating the ayahuash is not the potential of the substance of substance , but his elaboration . It 's started by two elements .
And on the side , this lian law that has a series of beta-carboline , harmful and harmolines , slightly hole .
And then , it 's the plants has a blum that altera little bit that it 's a little bit of consciousness , but it 's measured with the leaves of a family of coffee , he said Psychotria viridis .
This plants is contains powerful powerful triple , very similar to serotonin , dimethoxtamine-5 , methoxydiptamine-5 , methoxtamine .
If you ever see Yanomami , pull up to the ball that they do from a different set of species , he 's contains in methoxydimethoxtamine .
It 's a little bit of the dust is a little bit of how to be discile from a card of paints , and land on a sea of electricity . [ Risate not creates a distorsion of reality ; it creates the reality .
I was often with my professor , Richard Evan Shultes , the man who has taken the psychc was psychical , with his discovery of the fungi of the fungi lower fungi in Mexico .
Second my thesis , you can 't classified these triptamine as well as well as you can 't tell no one of being hadn . [ Risate ] The triptamine , they can 't be suntamine , they can 't be killed by a zyme that 's natural zoom , that 's not being sundase-inoaminoaminds .
It 's possible to be able to be in the horally only if you 're asking with other chemicals that denian out .
Now it comes to the beautiful : the coal . The question is the MAr , the same kind of necessary to potential are inner of MAO , the same type of potential to potential triptamine : in a flour population , how these people have to find two degrees degrees of plants , how do you have two deogically degrees not , but that if you combined in this way , they create a biochemical version of the submm of the parts ?
We use the great euthror of the proof of the proof and errror , which can reveal infrufer .
But if you ask the Indians , they 'll tell us " The plants are talking about . "
What does it mean ?
This tribes , the Cofan , 17 variety of ayahuasthank , which distinguess in the forest , and that our eyes would remain the forest .
If you ask them how they 're stable their tassonoming us , " I realized it realized , " I realized I thought , " No . "
The solution is : they take the 17 variety of a full full of a full of a full , and each one will a different dot .
With this is not graduate to Harvard , but it 's much more interesting to count the stones .
Now , [ applaushes the problem is that even the ones of us who have to heart popular people find them paintings are painting , but in some way reducts to the margins of the history of our real world , and pass over .
In fact , the X-century century , it will not be remembered for his drives or its technologies , but as the same as the was where we 're stopped and actively accepted or acceptively accepted or accepted , or accepted , and it 's not the problem is not the change .
All cultures through the centuries have been involved in a new dance of life .
And the problem is not technology .
The Sioux Indians have no stopped to be Sioux when they put up the arc and they receive as they have no stopped to be in the horse and heat .
It 's not the change or technology that threats the etnosphere . It 's the power . It 's the power .
The hard flight of domination .
And if you give a look at the world , you find that these are not destinated cultures are destinated to disappear .
They 're living and dynamic creatures out of the existence of hyperforces that are going to go beyonic and beyonic and spining .
I know , you 're demand tracts in the pathries of Penan --
a population of Sarawak , in Sarawak , in the Sarnest Asian , who lived in the forest to a generation , and now reduced to the servite and now reduced to the reported of the reported , where you can see the river inquiny that seems to be a half a neo to Meridian Cinese Meridian , where the Syapordional Meridian , where the giaphorizoned Meridian ,
With the wooden style with the forest .
Or , in the case of Yanomami , are the disease that have come to the purposes of the gold .
If we move on on the mountain of Tibet , where I 'm doing a lot of research , you 'll see the hard hard hard flight .
As you know , the physical exince of a population , is convicted to the universal level , but the ethnocide , but the ethnocide , the destroyle destroyle , because it 's not just a concerts , but advanced by the development of development .
And you can 't understand the suffering of Tibet until you get from the beginning .
I 've been on the 6,000 miles from Chengdu in Chengdu , through Tibet s-the-s-to-board with a young colleagues , but only came to Lhasa young colleagues , but only came to Lhasa that I 'm talking about .
6,000 sacred monuments in dust and cenjoy .
1.2 million people killed by the military ,
The father of this guy was ascriticized at Panchen Lama .
That means that it was killed in the time of the Chinese invasion .
So the uncle was sitting with Santity in Santity , he took the population in Nepal .
His mother was unlived and his colth was rejected .
It was taken to hidden in career at the age of two years from its gonna deaths because he couldn 't live without him .
The sister , which did the same , was put in reducation field .
A day , he had inaved a day coffiging Mao and , for this transgression , was mit to the jobs , was mit to seven years .
The Tibet of Tibet is to be insustained , but the spirit of the people is tener .
And then , it all reduces a choice .
We want to live in the world world world 's the monoony or want to accover the world polluted ?
The great anthropologists Margaret Mead , before he died that his biggest paar was that , in our going to be able to do this frightening view of human imagination , not only to see the whole range of human imagination reduced to a very limited day , and we 're going to see from a sleep forgotten by a sleep forget .
And it 's umillion million years .
The Neolitics Rvolution , who has gives us the agriculture , which has made us underfighting the seed of the seed smooth , creating the poetry of the clay , creating the hierarchy of specialization , and we talk about 10,000 years ago .
The industrialized world has 300 years old .
That 's not about history , I don 't suggests that we have the answers to all the challenges that we have to deal with the millennia to come .
When you know , these myriades of the world is asked what it means to be human , they 're asking with 10,000 different voices .
And it 's in these answers that we all have the chance to be what we are : a conscious kind of a kind of a conscious kind of good , that has to get all the people and all the gardens of optitimism . And there are great moments of optitimiss .
I went to this picture on the northern summariland of Baffin the island , when I went to the journal claw with Inuit , Olaya , Olaya , and he told me the wonderful story of his grandfather .
The canadese government was not always gentle-always was gentlement with the Inuit and in the ' 50s to stabilias , we have to give them them them in colonies .
The grandfather of this man refuted to go .
The family , texture for his life , and he took them all the boundaries .
You have to know that Inuit don 't temate the freeze , they 're going to do it .
The pacins of sleep in the origin were made of pain .
The grandfather of this man didn 't have been sitting at night or from the library at night or the library .
It 's sleep , you 've calculated the pantalone in the foot in the focused in your hand . When the photos are fuck , the worked creating a moama .
It 's spred on the point of this coltello of the core of this coltellim , killed a dog .
It has taken a sleep , and created a brilliance , with the casser cass created a sleep , has imbrilliant another dog and it 's disappeared on the bank , hell in the shake , himself .
We want to talk about cavarself-daily ? [ Risate . And this , in different ways , [ Applausi is the symble of the population of the population of the population of the population of the world .
In the april of 1999 , the canadese government redded by the Inuit , the total control of an area of a bigger territory of California and Texas mitted .
It 's their new paa . It 's called Nunut .
It 's a independent territory . They all the resources of the mineraries .
One of the splendies of how a national national state can recognize with his population .
And , to finish , I think it 's pretty obvious at least at least the remote song of the planet , realize that they don 't have to remote .
For somebody 's home .
They represent severtions of human imagination that are rising at the dawn of time . And for all of us , the dreams of these children , as the dreams , become part of the hardness of hope .
From , we have National Geographic , we 're convinced that politics will never come to nothing .
We believe that the polemies --
[ Applausi ] not persuasive , but we believe that the stories can change the world , and maybe we 're the best institution to tell stories of the world . Every month , our site has been to get 35 million visitites .
156 countries spring our television channel .
Our rists are lectual lands from millions of people .
Our work is to travel in the etnosphere to bring our audience in places that are going to be able to have seen as a lot of cut out of how they 've seen as they saw and , you hope , abbraced the central reveal of the world , and we have to find a style style world , and we have to find a life in a plurality world of pluralist and multicultural world 's going to be a pluralistle and multicultural reveal ,
where the wisdom of all the population can contributing to our collective well-being collective well-being collective well-being .
Thank you .
I 'm going to talk about some things that I wrote in this book that I hope you 've already heard and proverse to the argue that you 've heard and proversus , in the case , you don 't notice .
I want to start with what I call " the official dogma . "
The official dogma of what ?
The official dogma of all society society society , the Western society , the official dogma , " If you want to massimilar well-being of our citizens . " The way to do it is massive to do it is to be massisimilar freedom . "
The reason is , from one side , in the fact that freedom is in itself a value , is pretious , is user , user , essential , human beings .
Of the other is that if we are free , each of us can act for their own to do all of doing what massimilar is , no one that you decide in name .
The way to massimilar freedom is massisimilar .
The more choices are , the more they 're free , and more more , is their wealth , is their well-being .
This , I think , it 's so deeply royed in the society that nobody would be able to put it in doubt .
And it 's also drubed in our lives .
I 'm going to show you some examples of what progress as possible .
This is my supermarket . It 's not particularly big .
I have a simple note on the condition for the windry .
In my supermarket , there are 175 conditions , without contate the 10 variety of extraverage olive and 12 aceters that you can buy the number of the inrescore of the increscore of the increscore that nobody of one of the 175 proning is to your degrees .
Here 's how the super-market .
Then you go to the wrote of electronics to buy a stereo : casse lector , radio , piahand , piaright , prlifier .
And in this single core , there 's a big number of audio components .
We can make six million different fighting and a half million different combinations using the components that there are only a store .
You have to admit that there is a lot of choice .
Other camps : the world of communications .
Once , when I was a child , you could get all the telephone services , which were forign by the mom Bell .
He had the phone , he didn 't buy it .
A consequence of that , the other was that the phone didn 't break .
These days are gone .
Now we have a variety variety of telephones , especially between cell phones .
Here 's the cell phones of the future .
My favorite is the middle , MP3 , cut lettore , ball of the nose , and foreign for the bruleless .
If you haven 't seen it in the near arly near the house , you 're very much certs that will be coming .
And what happens is that people go into the gods and make this question . And you know , what 's the answer is , " No . "
It 's not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn 't do too too many things .
So , in other aspects of life that are much more importantly than acquired , you know , the same explosion of choices .
Assistence : The health is not going on in the United States that you go from the doctor and the doctor you have to say what you have to do .
Instead , you go to the doctor , and the doctor says , " OK , we could do , or B , " A has these benefits and the risks , " Be , " has these benefits . " Well , you want to do ? "
You say , " Dottore , what should I do ? "
And the doctor says , " A has these benefits and these risks , B has these benefits and these risks . "
" What do you want to do ? "
And you rebits : " Dotore if she was me , what would you do ? "
And the doctor : " But I 'm not . "
The result of the call , " authonomy of malate , expression that makes it look like a beautiful thing .
But actually it 's not that one to move the weight and responsibility of making decisions from someone knows something , which is the doctor , to someone else knows , and almost certainly unless , and so it 's not in the right condition to make decisions .
There 's a huge marketing of products drug products , direct to people like me and you , that if you think you don 't have any sense , because we can 't buy them .
But if we can 't buy them , why do you ?
The answer is that they want to domesting the doctor to ask them to change the rich .
Something about how we have our identity is our own orever is a question of choice , how you see in this jypan , " We don 't want to force the children . We 're going to give their sex right now . " We don 't have to invent .
And we can reinvented how many times us .
That means that every morning , you have to decide that kind of person you want to be .
I 've been going to have the family and marriage , a time the common perspective , which was almost to , it was that there was a lot of fast as possible , and it was that it was there to the most price as possible .
The only versus choice was with who , not when , and even what do after .
Over the day , it 's really to play .
I 'm going to start very smart students , and I do 20 percent in less than a time .
And it 's not because they 're brilliant , not because they 're undiligent .
but why am I impensieres , I mean , I should you marry or not ? I should you have to do that ? "
" Do I have to marries later ? " I have to think before you have children or career ? "
They 're interrogative interrogative .
And they 're trying to answer these questions , even though this is not complete the companies that I 'm not going to get a beautiful vote to my exam .
And they have to do it . They 're important questions .
Now , the work : we are fortunate , like Carl underneath , because technology allows us to work every minute , every day , every day , every day , from every day , from every day , from every day , from every day , from every day , from every day , from every day , from every day , from every day , from every day , from every day , from every day , from
There 's a parentis a angle , and I 'm not going to tell anybody what , where the WiFi works .
I don 't tell you , because I want to use it .
What does this mean , this incredible freedom of choice that we have to work ? That 's that we have to do it , continually , if we have to work or not .
We can go to see our son playing hot , with the cell phone in a pockberry , the Blackberry in the other , and the news , typically , on the ginkle .
And even though I 'm all spent , every minute that we see our son is actually asking , we 're also asking , " Did you have to answer this called ? "
" Did I have to answer this email ? "
And even when the answer is " no , " all this makes the experience of your own son , very different than what would be in other conditions .
So , anywhere we look , little , things , big , things , the materials and life is a question of choices .
Once the world was this : Ovation , there were some chance , but it was not a question of choice .
The world of today is a world today : The dilemma is , " That 's a good thing , or negative ? "
The answer is Surch .
We all know , the positive lated ball . So I 'm going to talk about the negative .
That 's what this is two negative effects of people .
The first , is that it 's going to be a lot of liberation .
With a lot of options between which choose , becomes very difficult to do it .
I give you an example example : a meant study conducted on the flap of volunteer .
A colleague has had access to the Vanden data , the giant society , the giant society , with about a million pension , with about a million people in 2,000 different companies .
What she found is that for every 10 solutions that are coming to more , the percentage of adhhhesion of two percent .
With 50 four-offer-four-percent four-percent in adhhhesions , when they 're only five . Why ?
Because with 50 four-four-four-four-four-inspired , and choice is remained to decide ,
And I ask the question , and I ask the tomorrow , and of course , I think , of course , he never comes .
You know , it doesn 't mean that that these work from old work for dogs because they don 't have enough money , they want to say that decision is so hostics that allose is so ostics that lose the fundamental damental dators of work .
They 're not participating , they 're losing until five thousand dollars for year from work , which would be well disposed to be .
So , the paralysis a consequence of having too too many choices .
And I think it makes the world this .
" And to finish , for ethchup , senape or maionese ? "
You 'd have to take the right decision , if it 's for ethernity , right ?
You don 't want to choose the wrong wrong , and you have the wrong condition .
So this is the first effect . The second is that we can avoid the paralysis and make a choice , we 're less we 're being demed with less options as we 're being with less options to be as much as we have been with less options .
And this for different reasons .
One of these is that with many condition between which you choice , if you buy one and it 's not perfect , it 's easy to imagine that you could have a different choice that would be better . And what happens is that the alternative imagined us that you could have been a different choice , and the rest of the rest of choice , and the rediant reamed by the decision , and the rest of the result of the decision that you could have been in the decision ,
even when it was a great decision .
The more choices there are , more is easy to dislierate than any details that is unlife-like choice .
And also , there 's what economists call expensive opportunity .
Dan Gilbert has close very well stamattine as the value that we give things depends on what we 're confront of .
And we know , when there are many possible options , it 's easy to representing the characteristics of alternative alternative , and being less satives of the option that you have been choice .
Here 's one example . I 've all been doing the ones that are not New York .
But that 's what you would probably think .
There 's this copy to Hamptons .
A lussian place .
It 's really about splendida . Ot-day . It 's all about them .
Not nothing . But what he thinks is , " Well , the eless , the Agoen . "
" All my neighbors in Manhattan are away . "
" I could talk about the home . "
And it 's two weeks that I 've been losing -- every day -- the chance of parking -- the ability to parking where it wants .
The expensive opportunity diminustrate for what we have , even when the choice was a cell excellent .
And the other people that we have to consider , the most of the attractive characteristics will remain against how it are expensive .
Here 's another example .
This is tells us a lot of things .
It 's about living the time , and maybe live slowly .
But the most important point is that anything you choose , you know , you 're not doing other .
The things that we don 't choose to be a lot of attractive , which can make less attractive what we do .
Third point : The spiral growing of expectations .
I tried this on my skin buying a new jeans .
I 'm going to be jeans .
Once the jeans were just a type , buy them and besty , they were besty , just after having them a life and work , just after having them a lot of times , began to go .
So , I went to buy a couple of jeans , and I said , " I need a couple of jeans , this is my cut . "
The committed commit , he said , " Look , fit , relationaxed ? "
Do you want to have the cerniera or the bottons ? " Stonewashed or " acidlaved ? "
" Look , " Loook ? "
" Hey , he wants or stretched them . Bbla bla -- " Continuated to elenjoy .
I was sbalord , and after a little bit , I could say , " I want the guy that was the only guy , " He didn 't have no idea what was , so for a little bit of a hour , and then I went out to the snore , I 'm going to do the best pair of jeans that ever had .
It was the massive . With all that I had the best .
But I felt out worse .
Why ? I wrote a whole book to understand it .
The reason I was worse is that with all that choice was very high , the jeans had to be perfect .
I had expectations . I didn 't wait about exceential , when there was only one guy , but when I saw 100 different steps , accidents , at least one guy had to be perfect .
What I had buy was good , but not perfect .
After I had a paragoned that I was trying to do what I was trying to do was unsationed in confronted to the expectations .
The adding options in life is not to increase the expectations that these have respect to the excellence of the same .
And this will prove less satifation , even when the results are good .
Nobody in the world of marketing , you realize .
Because if they knew , you wouldn 't know what I 'm talking about .
The truth looks more like this .
" You know , it was better when it was worse . " The reason he was better when it was worse was worse , when it was worse was even possible to meet the surprised pleasure .
Over the world , we live in the world we live in -- opulent , industrialized pherto-expectancy , which we can hope is that things are at the height of expectations .
You never have surprised to you ever have pleased because your expectations , my expectations , they 're ungant .
The secret of happiness -- what you 're here -- it 's , " Baxis , " Yes , you want . "
I mean , the careographic moment -- which are actually married and my wife is really amazing .
I couldn 't do better , I didn 't have any accounted .
But it 's not always a bad thing .
And finally , a consequence of buy jeans is that when you have that jeans is that when you 're not satisssatisfaced , and you ask you , " Why ? "
" Who is responsible ? " , the answer is clear .
The world is responsible . What could I do ?
When there are hundreds of kinds of jeans , and buy one insuddisfacing , and you ask you who are responsible , is the clear , it 's the clear that responsible are you .
You could do better .
With hundreds of variety of variety of variety , there are no cut of the insuccess .
So when people get decisions , even if the result is valido , they feel unsatic , they feel unabsolutely undatives , and they give the colate .
In the last years , the depression is exploded in the world industrialized world .
I think that a meant factor -- not the only one , but important -- of this honate depression is that people have a dollar experiences because standard are too high .
And when they have to explain this situation they think that the colth is they think .
So the final result is that we 're better , objectively , but we feel worse .
Let me remember you .
This is the official dogma , what we all take for good and it 's completely flew . It 's not true .
There 's no doubt that a little bit of choice is better than not having any of them , but it doesn 't really hold , but it 's not to have a little bit better than a little bit .
There 's a critical value , magic . I don 't know what it 's .
But I 'm sure we 've been overcome from a piece of the level where the choices are improve our life .
Now , from the political point of view -- I almost finished -- from the point of view , the noccell is the following .
What allows us all this choice in the society is the material recheating .
There are many places in the world , and you know , you know , which the problem is not that they have a lot of choice .
The problem is that they have too pop .
So the factory that I 'm talking about is a malbeing exusive extrlusive , reququire society .
And what it does depress and climbing is this : Steve Levitt has talked about how much the expensive and the purches of the size and the babs for babs are unuseful .
I mean these choices , complicated and you have that 's not that they 're just unuseful .
I 'm sure I 'm a deleterie .
They 're going to be worse .
If a little bit of what in our society is actually reversed in those where people have too much more chance , it would not just their life to improve but our own life .
This is what economists call a parlele-horing improving .
A redistribution of income redistribution to all -- not only to the poor -- because of this choice in excess that we have .
To finish : " Fille , you can become all what you want "
You know , people of culture , you 'll think , " But what does that fish ? "
" It 's obvious that you can 't get anything in a glass box . "
" A recastrated view , a limited view of the world --
and I 've interpreted this this , at the beginning .
But then , I realized , I 'm realized that that fish the shes the long .
Because the reality of the fact is that if you manda manda in frantums , so that " all you can 't get freedom . You get the paralysis .
If you break the bocet in a way that all divent you can diminule satifation .
You can get the paralysis , and you reduced the well-being .
Everybody needs a sphere .
This is almost certainly too close , maybe even for the fish , and surance for us .
But the absence of a symbolic symbolic symbolic symbology and texture , for the ruin .
Thank you very much .
