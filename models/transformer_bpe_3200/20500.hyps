Last year I showed these these slides to show that the glacial calottartics , which is almost three million years had the size of 48 million years had the size of 48 .
But this underlying underlying the gravity of the problem because I don 't show the spending of ice .
The arctic glacial calotage is , in a certain sense , the clear of the global climate system .
You expanies .
The next slide will be a rapid carried for the past 25 years .
The glaces are signed in red .
You can see , they expand until blue blue .
That 's the ice in the winter , which is ritira of summer .
You can see that the cosidamage cosidamage , five years or more , is like blood , which here was a blood , which here was a blood of the body .
In 25 years , it 's past , at 25 years , so .
This is a problem because the heat at at the ground , the glaciated around the ocean , where there are huge amounts of carbon congelated that , and they 're translating , they 're transformed in the microbes .
I 'm going to go to totality about the injury of inquination , that could double , super--scale .
In some shopping laghi , in Alaska , it 's already rebold on the water .
The professor Katey Walter of Alaska University of Alaska team who was a blow last horse .
Video : Wow ! Al Gore : Wow ! Al Gore : if we 're also going to be .
That 's a reason that this termal surround environment from the North North .
This is a glacial regime .
The landed never had reached levels of similar .
This is the Kangerlussuaq , in the west of Groenland .
If you want to know how the sea level for the ice of the ice on the therrafers on the land , here is where the sea .
These current current are very quickly .
Another part of the planet : Antartide , the largest block of the planet .
The last month scientists have dichied that the painting of ice is in negative , and that pogn Antarctica , which poging on some islun-underwater , is particularly rapid in the month .
That 's a six feet of the acque level , like Groenland .
Himalaya , the biggest block of ice , you see new laghi , and you see new laghi , which few years ago they were glacier .
40 percent of the world population is half of the potail from that the monothor .
Sulle Ande : this glacier is the source of the potability of this city .
The landed has increased .
But when I diminds , the same happens to the water water .
In California the nenow on Sierra Nevada is 40 percent .
The hydroes are in crises .
The predictions , as you read , they 're good .
The growing sses in the world door to a remarkable remarkable .
The environmental disaster disaster , they 're increasing a rhythm outside the normal and without precedenting .
Four times more numheroes in the last 30 years of respect to 75 .
This is a whole insustainable .
If you look at the historic context if you can see the consequences .
In the last five years we added 70 million tons of CO2 every 24 hours -- 25 million tons of the ocean every day .
Look at the area of the oriental Pacific , the Americas , to the west , and both both of the parts of the Indian continent , where there 's a rootal oxygen in the ocean .
The major cause of global warming , together to deforestation , which is 20 percent , is the use of fossil fuel .
The oil is a problem , and the carbon is even worse .
The United States is one of the two countries with more emissions , together to China .
And it was proposing to build a lot of other carbon carbon .
But we 're seeing a direction changing .
These are the anteed ank-projects proposes and some green alternative alternative ,
And so , there 's a political lost in our country .
The carbon industry and the oil have spent 250 million dollars in the last year to promote carbon , which is a pullit oxymon , which is a bsign .
And I would remember something -- I would remember something --
Natal , Tennessee , where I live , there was a loss of 3.8 billion ligallons of carbon spaces .
You 've seen it on the news .
This is the second largest flying of the last flow in America .
It 's happened around Natal .
The Naliice of one of the carbon industry was this .
Video : Does the tasty is a kind of allegro and happy .
It 's abundant here in America , and it makes our economy .
From carbon is more and smaller .
It 's good price , adorable and work , they keep the stypend .
Al Gore : From here is a lot of West Virginia .
The biggest mineral society on mountains is Massey Coin . This is his administrator .
Video : Don Blankenship : I 'm going to be clear -- Al Gore , Nancy Peloid -- they don 't know what they 're talking about .
Al Gore : So the Alleance for Proteition of Clima has launched two campaign .
This is a one of them , a part .
Video : Attore : ALergy : ALergy , we see climate change as a serious serious serious as a serious serious serious serious .
So , our priority is to invest a big amount of money in a bunch of advertising to make public and confused the truth .
In fact , carbon 't it 's not sporite .
We think it 's clean -- it 's also a good profum .
So , not pregnant to the climate change .
Let me do it .
Video : Attore : Carbone pullit -- you 've heard a lot of me .
So let 's do a little bit of a structure to the avaning of the pullit .
Straordinary ! The machines are a little rumorous , but this is the sound of the pullit technology technology technology .
The carbon consumption is between the main coal cause , but the remarkable technology , but the remarkable technology of the pullit that you see changes everything .
You look at a look : this is the odiergn of the pullit technology .
Al Gore : finally , the positive alternative alternative , and the national security , and the national security .
Video : The America is in crisis ; the economy , the national security , the national security crisis .
The file that connects all : our dependence from fossil fuel combustible , like the sporite of fossil and oil .
Now , there 's a new , audace , audace to use it .
Res 100 percent of clean energy , in 10 years .
A plan to reput America to work , make sure , and make sure more sure , and help stop the global warming .
And finally , a solution that bast to solve our problems .
Repower . Scoprice more .
Al Gore : This is the last one .
Video : It 's about report , it 's going to return to America .
One of the faster ways to bring to the dependence of the combustible that killing our planet .
Man : The future is here . Very , a new energy network .
Novi investments for bone-investments of bunch work .
Repower America . It 's time to be realists .
Al Gore : A old proverbio : A man man who says , " If you want to go fast , you go to fast .
If you want to go away , you go back together . "
We have to go away , fast .
Thank you very much .
Look at TED , I did a introduction on the LHC .
And I promise to travel to travel up to how the car works .
So here I was there . And for the ones that had no , the LHC is the biggest scientific experiment -- 27 kilometers of circles .
Her task is to reretreating the conditions that were present less than a billion of the universe -- until 600 million times a second .
All that 's just environment .
This is the car under Ginevra .
We 're going to take these min-Big Bang in the remarkers .
This is what I work . It 's called ATLAS -- is 44 feet and has a 22 feet .
This is a spectacular picture of ATLAS in building so you can see the proportions .
Ten September 10 of the past year we accept the machine for the first time .
And this picture was taken from ATLAS .
It was because of immense freshesteggies in control .
It 's an image of the first fascil of particles that had done all the around the LHC , entering in collision , dollar part of the LHC , and spread particles inside the remarker .
In other words , when we see that image 10 settember , we knew that the machine worked , which is a big witory .
I don 't know if it was going to do that more or this , when somebody went on on Google and saw that the page was this .
That means we had a cultural impact beyond to the scientific scientific impact .
About a week later , there was a problem with the car , had to have them here -- these files here -- these fixes here -- these fixed bles .
These files are 13,000 amping when the car works at the massive works .
Now , the technicians of you will look at the files and say , " It 's not true . I 'm very overwheeless . "
And they can do that because when they 're very frequently become the superconducting pile .
So , at least 271 degrees , in a temperature in the space between the stars , these files can bring that current .
In one of the most novehicle of the most novehicle in the LHC , there was a fect of fabrication .
So the files are going to give a slightly , and 13,000 points of suddenly met , they met a resistance .
This was the result .
Now , this is still more impressive if you think that these magneti fish more than 20 tons , and you 're moving about 30 centimeters .
They 're damage about 50 magneti .
We had to take them , what we did .
We 've been represent them and traveled .
They 're now going to be return all to their place underground .
By the end of the LHC is going to be again integral .
We 're going to access it , and we expect to get to the data or the bunch or the bunch of the lawyer , and we 're going to go to the universe .
Now , of course , in a certain way , these accidents return the dibate on the value of science and engineering the value of science and engineering the front of science and engineering the front of science and engineering the face . It 's easy to convictions .
I think the fact that it 's so hard , the fact that I think it 's the value of things like the LHC .
I would like to end with the words of a English scientists , Humphrey , which , I imagine , in difense of inuseful experiments of his pupille , his pupille was Michael Faraday , he said , " Nithing is so much dangerous for the progress of the human mind of the mind of science of the human mind of the mind of the science of the human mind of the mind of the science of the human mind of the human mind of the mind of the mind that the ideas of the conquest . "
Thank you .
I want to start asking you to rethink of when children , you get coon the morning .
While you can understand how to reach them and get them , and you 're going to move them , and you learn them , and you know , you know , and you know , you know , you know , and you know , you know , you know , and you know , you can actually think and solve the space .
The space reasoning is deeply connected to the way we understand a lot of the world around us .
So , from the inspired use of our interaction with physical objects , together to my physical consulent Pat my talk , and the collaborator Jeevan Kalanithi , I started asking asking , " If we use a computer , instead of having the mouse of the mouse as a pollyror , we could actually trust a fix hands , we could actually trust a scientist , with hands , you both have a gave hands ,
and how do we like to do that ?
The question was so interesting that we decided to explore the answer , building Siftable .
In a few words , a Siftable computer is a great interactive computer as a biscope .
In a few words , a Siftable computer is a great interactive computer as a biscope .
You can move them with your hand , they can see " between them , " You can see their movement and they have a screen and a screen and a radio wireless .
But basically , they 're physical objects , like the morning , you can move it simply , you can move in the mistake .
The Siftable is the example of a new ecosystents to manipulate digital information .
And as they become more physicians , consciousness , consciousness of other , and as they become more physical , conscious , of how we movement , of how we movement , we can explore new and different styles of interaction .
I 'm going to start with some simple example .
This Siftable is configured to show the video : if you put it in a direction , video , the video will round , video , it will round the other side .
These interactive rate rate rate of other .
If you take them , they 're interested in what they 're around .
If they 're surrounded , they can act a little bit .
If they 're surrounded , they can act a little bit .
They also have their movement and inclination .
We then realized that one of the interesting implications of the interaction was to be able to use managed to data , for example , " a color like , " a liquid .
In this case , we have three Siftable configured as a bunch band I can use them to the color in the middle , where they mix .
and I can use them to be able to be brought .
If we 're too too much , we can put a little bit of place .
And I 'm also good possibilities of appricing , like language , the mathematics and logic games where people can try things very quickly , and you see the results of immediately .
Now I 'm now --
This is a Fibonacks I do with a program that I do with a program of equations .
So we have a words that 's half a words that 's going to half in Scarabeer and oble .
And then you have a letter in the case of every Siftable , Pratically , at every Siftable , Pratically , you get a letter at any of you get a letter in case of comporing a dictionary .
Then , about 30 seconds they remissed , and you have a new leckle set of reading and new possibilities to try .
Thank you .
Here 's the children came to the Media Lab , I did that so I tried them and I 've been shown a video .
They 're very pleased .
And one of the things that kind of application is that you don 't have to give people a lot of education .
You just say , " Compons of words , " and they know exactly what to do .
Here 's here to other people try it .
This is our youngest tester tester , there on the right .
And it was actually wanted to impilling them .
They only were morning , for him .
Now , this is a appliation of a interactive chart .
We wanted to build a tool for the Lui of languages is Felix .
It can put new characters in the scene , you know , Siftable .
It can put new characters in the scene , you know , Siftable .
So , here 's going to get out the sun .
Video : The sun is surgencdo .
David Merrill : Now , she took a treat at the scene .
Video : The arange hold .
Bel work ! Yeah !
So , you get Siftable and put close to interact with the characters --
Video : Bau !
-- inventing your story .
Video : Hi !
DM : It 's a story with final open , and it can decide him how you 're going to be .
DM : It 's a story with final open , and it can decide him how you 're going to be .
Very , right , throws .
DM : The last example I have time to show you is a time to show you is a tool , I 've got to show you is a tool , I 've got to show you .
It 's a tool , I recently recently , to trampioning and executionary music .
The Siftable here are sounds like the bass and bacteria .
Each of these has four different variations , and you can choose that use .
You can also also insert these sounds in a sequence from you to comporing your pleasure .
And I just modify it by doing a sound and a sequence . "
These are actually actually that you can control from the vial , like the reverber and the filter .
The attacks to a particular one , and then inclens to travel it .
And then there are the general effects like time and volumes , which they applied to the entire sequence .
Let 's look like it works .
Video : We 're going to start with a by-based , we 're going to get a by--sequence , we put it in a series , we add other base .
Now I put a bass line .
Video : DM : Now I add percussions --
Video : And now I 'll put the filter to bacteria , so I can control the effect from the alive .
Video : I can be able to be able to be able to be able to be a straight time from one side .
Video : And now I 'm going to add to the bass to give more expression .
Video : I can recombine the sequence of the flight .
So I don 't have to plan it before , but I can suddenly make it longer or corn .
And now , finally , I can spend the interion on the left , the Siftable to the left is a flying on the left .
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is to build new new interfaces of the car , and more soemer than our brain work and body .
And today , I had time to show you one of the result of this path , and also some possibility that we try to bring out from the lab .
The concept I want to get to you is that 's coming to this new generation of designed objects to interact with digital media , which we 're going to bring information in information in our world in the way we want .
Thank you very much .
I don 't see the hour with you .
I 'm a writer .
And I 'm going to be books is my profession , but it 's more than that , obviously .
It 's also love and the fashion and the fashion of my life .
And I don 't expect that it can change .
But , I said , something particular happened to my life and in my career , which has taken me to realibrate the entire relationship with this work .
The particular thing is I recently written this book , this biography called " Mangia , Prega , Ama , " which , diversly from my precedented books , for some reason used in the world and became a big , truly , the international thing .
And the result is that everywhere you go now , people treat me as if I was convicted .
It 's true -- conconvicted ,
They 're all going to be worried and they say , " Don 't you feel that much more ?
You don 't have any fear to keep writing for all life without being able to create a book that can important to someone ? "
that can be important to someone ? "
It 's unsure , you know .
But it could go worse , part of the one remember , I remember that more than 20 years ago , when I started saying to people -- I was a writing writing .
I would meet in the same reaction based on the fear .
And people said , " Don 't you temes to be successful ?
Do you have you fear that the humiliation of refied you ?
Do you have no fear to do this mestize for all life without anything that you ever outside and die on a a mule of dreams with the pile of dreams with the pile to failing ? "
So , you know .
The answer -- the short answer to all these questions is , " Yes . "
Yeah , I 'm fear to all of these things .
I always had fear .
And I also fear with many other things that people can 't indeed .
As the algae and other spending things .
But , how much about the writing what I thought and I would ask me last multiely is why ?
Is that rational ?
It 's logical that anybody has to expect to be spended by a job that you 've been born to do .
But what is that particularly in the creative impress to make us nervous health care in a way that other people in a way that other career don 't do ?
How my father , for example , he was a chemical engineer and I don 't remember one time in his 40 years of the activity that was asked if he had fear to be engineer ?
There was never -- that blowing my engineer John , how does it go ?
Don 't work that , do you know ?
Onestly , chemicals like they don 't have a group of course , in the centuries , guadagned the reputation of being alcolized .
We have enough writers , we have enough reputation , and not just writers , but creative creative of all kinds of reputation , this reputation of being huge unstable .
And it 's not even more than you look at the sad , the deaths of the magnificments of the magnificments of the 21st century , they die young and often .
And even the ones that don 't have been suiciates seem to be really disfaced by their dones .
Not Mailer , before he died , in the last interview said , " Every book had killed me a little more more " an extraordinary affermation about the work of your life .
But we don 't just beat when we feel these things so long that we 've been doing so long that in some way we completely completely interiorized and accepted the notion that creativity and suffering are somehow linked and the art , at the end , it will always condut the geese .
And the question I want to bring all of today is : are you agree with this idea ?
It 's good to you this thing -- because also , you 're looking at a centimeter of distance to me , it 's not good for this supposition .
I think it 's hate .
And I think it 's dangerous and I don 't want to see the perpetuated in the next century .
I think it 's better to encourage our big creative minds .
And I surance I know that , in my case -- it would be very dangerous to start fire towards that feel obviously of supposing the circumstoming that I 'm in my career .
That 's true -- you know , I 'm pretty young , I 'm pretty young , I have about 40 years .
I still have about four work decades .
And it 's very likely that everything I write in now , it 's going to be right from the world like the work that I used to go through my last book .
I 'm going to be slavery , because we 're all more or less friends here -- it 's likely to my big success is to my shoulder .
Oh , Gesus , I thought !
You know this is the kind of thought that leads a person to start to bing a nine in the morning and I don 't want to do that .
I would go to do this work that we work .
So , the question is that , how ?
And so I think , after a lot of reflections , the way to work to keep writing is to create a psychological construct , right ?
I have to find a safety distance of me , I 'm writing , and my natural anxiety of which reaction the writing that wrote , and I was trying to do it , and I was trying to see if they could look through the time , trying to find other society to see if they could have better ideas and more sane and more healing and more sane , and more sane , you know ,
And how to help people creative to manage the inerent risks of creative risks .
And that research has taken me to the Green and ancient Rome .
I 'm going to go to your eye and then back back .
In the ancient Green and ancient Rome -- people didn 't seem to believe that creativity came from men , OK ?
And he thought the creativity was this spirit looking at devine and that came to men from a few people distant and unknown , for distant reasons and unknown , for distant reasons and unknown .
The greatest demand , they called the spirites of creativity " demons . "
Socrate , wonderful , he thought of having a band elarggload .
The Roomes were the same idea , but they called that the spirit species of spirit .
That 's great , because Rooms didn 't really think that a genius was a very smart .
They thought a genius was this sort of divine devine that had been living literally in the muri of an artist , a little like the elpho Dobby , and that I came out of hidden and I was going to be born the result of the work of the work of the artist and models the result of that work .
Here 's the psychological distance of which I talk about -- that 's the psychological construct that protects you to protect your work .
And they all knew that was what was working , right ?
So the antiks were protected to be to certain things , like , for example , the too much narcible , right ?
If your work was exceptional , you couldn 't get all the desert , you know that you 've been helped by this incorporate genius .
If your failed work , it wasn 't all your failed , right ?
Everybody knew that was your genius to be a inable .
And so people han conceived creativity in Occide for a long time .
And then the Rinassent came and all the changed , and I was born this big idea ; we put the human being in the middle of the universe over all the misters and the mysteries and no longer to leave space .
This was the principle of humans and rational principle and people started thinking that creativity was completely from the ilililight-divided .
And for the first time in history , you start to refert to this or that artist as a genius rather than a person with genius .
And I have to say , I think it was a big mistake .
I think I allow someone , a simple person to believe that they 're like a recipient as a foundation , the essence and the source of all the mysteries , creative and unknown is a responsibility , unknown as a responsibility too big to give to the fragile psyc and so much of the human be.
It 's like to ask someone to enjoy the sun .
Deform and destaurable , and I think all these ingestishable ingestishes .
And I think it was this pressure that I was about 500 years old .
And , if this is true , and I think that is , the question becomes , and now ?
Can we do that diversity ?
Maybe I go back to a more ancient understanding of the relationship between humans and mystery .
Or maybe not .
Maybe we can 't cell 500 years of rational thinking in a death of 18 minutes .
And there 's probably people in the audience that would be legitimate scientific sospicing news about the notion of , you know that they follow the next people in their projects .
I 'm probably not going to convince you all about this thing .
But the question I would like to bring is -- why not ?
Why don 't you think about this way ?
Because it 's more of anything else that ever heard to explain the exasperts of the creative process .
A process that , as anybody who ever tried to do something -- so , basically , all here -- you know , you don 't compored .
And , in fact , it can sometimes be completely paranormous .
I did this meeting recently with the Ruth Ruth Stone , who has now 90 years , but that was a poetry for all life and said that during his infants in the rural Virginia , working out in the camps , and he felt it , he was working out in if a poem came from the landscape .
He said that it was like a frageous train .
And that was getting rotoling to her from the landscape .
He felt that , because he had to tremendous land under his feet .
He knew I had one thing to do to do that point and was , words , " and it was like a matta . "
And so he 's going to go home and came up with this poem , and it won 't have to take a piece of paper and a pretty quickly , and a pretty quickly , while the trapart , and rate it and grabbing it on the page .
Or , I couldn 't be enough , so it 's going to be pretty fast , and it 's not going to get to home and the rotolar the rottolar , and he would continue to rotolar through the landscape , trying , as she said , " another poet . "
And then there were those times -- this piece never forget the -- I 'm going to never -- there were the moments where the was almost losing , OK ?
So , he was running home and he was trying to get a little house and he was trying to get a pend in the way that he was going , and then said , which was like if you hallon the other hand and steffed .
He had a poem from the poem and reput it on his body and transcded it on the page .
And in these cases , the poem would be presented on the perfect and intact , but in the last word .
So when I felt thinking -- it 's very pathetic , it 's exactly the same same as my creative process .
Not all my creative process -- I 'm not a construct !
I 'm a mulo , and my way to work is ; I 'm going to take me to the same orary every day and play and go on the god and I 'll be over the gotten .
But even I , in my aggin testing , I 've been striped with that thing , sometimes .
And I imagine that many of you do the han made .
You know , even though the work and ideas came to me from a certain source you can 't west the west .
And what is this thing ?
And how can we relate to it in a way that we don 't lose your head , but rather , what do you get healing ?
And as I 'm going to be , the best example I have the musician that I have the musicist Tom , which I interviewed different years ago for a newspaits for a newspaits .
We were talking about this , and you know , Tom , for the majority of life was the incarnation of the incarnation of the incarnation of the incarnation of the injury , to try to control , dominating these species of the most impulses .
But then I 'm going to get , and one day while he was driving on a highway in Los Angeles , changed everything for him .
He was going to be fast and everything with this little framework , this little framment of melodia , which is going to come in his head as a inspiration , and you know , it 's wonderful , and you know , it 's wonderful , and the desider , but it doesn 't know how to take it .
It has no paper , he has no paper , he has no matter , it has no register .
So , I began to feel this kind of old old species to be growing in him , " I 'm going to lose , and I 'm going to hold it .
I 'm not pretty good and I can 't do it . "
And instead of going to go to the panicks .
And I 'm going to be the entire mental process and made something completely new .
I just just look at the sky and said , " Scry , I 'm not driving ? "
" Do you look like a song ?
If you really want to exist , you get a more opporting moment when I can take care of you .
Or , you go to important someone else today .
You get Leonard Cohen . "
And his process changed it after this .
Not the work , the work was still dark as a always .
But the process , and the anxiety that was require when he was releft when the genius , the genius that was going to go back back from where the other problems and freed it back from where it was , doing that he was doing that he didn 't have to be a whole thing and tormented .
But I wish this peculiar , wonderful bizarre collaboration between Tom and this strange and outside that allost .
So , how I felt that story started to change a little bit even the way I worked and I was already save me a time .
This idea , I was saving when I was writing " Mangia , " Ama , " and I got a lot of the disperation that we 're all working on something and we 're doing when we 're working on something and we can 't think that it 's going to be a disaster , which is going to be the worst book .
Not just bad , just the worst book written .
And I started thinking about giving this project .
But then I reminded about Tom who talked to the air and I tried to be .
So I went up to my face on the wild , and I reather my comments to a vacuum ,
And I said to high voices , " Sents , what , you 're going to be able to be brilliant not going to be brilliant hadn 't going to be brilliant .
Because as I 'm putting all I have , I don 't have this .
So if you want to be better , you have to present you and do your part .
Okay . But if you don 't do it , you know what , I don 't do anything .
I 'm going to write the same because it 's my work .
And I would like to favor that was recorded that I was presented that I was presented to do my part , " Because -- finally , OK -- sitting in the desert the gift of the damage of the bunch of the moon and the music , damage and sacred and music that go forward to the dry .
And they were always magnify because the ballerins were professionals and they were fantastic .
But every while , rarely , something happened , and one of these artists became actually transcending .
And I know what I talk about , because I know you all of you , at some point , a performance that you all , a performance .
It was like if the time , and the ballerny , and the ballerine walked through a kind of land-down , and it was all all of them .
And suddenly , not just appears as a human .
But it 's going to go from the divinity of divinity .
And when this was going to happen , people knew what was called him .
They were going to give up your hands and began to dotor , " Allah , God God God , " God God , " God God , "
That 's God , you know .
And the historical note -- when the Minvades the Spain , I was this habitude with them and proning changed in the seeds from " Allah , Allah , Allah , " " " Ole , Allah , " " " " " Ole , " which you can still hear in the corries .
In Spain , when a artist did something impossible and magic , " Allah , " Allah , " By , " I was a magnific thing , I was going to be able , I would say , " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " Allah , " " Ablah , " Allah , I was a magnific thing , " Alah , " Abh , " By , " , " Ablah , " Ala
And it 's great because we need .
But the problem is coming the day after , the ballerin the same , when you wake and discover that are the 11 in the morning of Martedday and the last 11 morning and the last thing .
It 's just a mortal with a mortal gock , and maybe it 's not going to be able to make that altel altation .
And maybe nobody will you say the name of God still as yra , and what does it have to do with the rest of his life ?
It 's hard .
This is one of the most painful recognized to do in a creative life .
But maybe it doesn 't have to be so angoscious if you can 't believe , mostly , which is more extraordinary than your being from yourself .
But you know , you 're just saying that they 're data in prested by a inimaginable source of this team that you have to go to someone else when you finished .
And , you know , if we think that in this way everything is changes .
And so I started thinking about it , and it 's sure as I thought about it for different months during the working on the book that I 'm going to be on , the dangerous , I 'll attesissue , I 'll just followed my big successful .
And what I have to continue to tell me when I feel electric .
It 's not just a lot . It 's just your work .
You can put your part of your part , any can be .
If your work is dance , you know , you know .
If the divine , I assurd you to make a decide to leave some kind of wonderful , for a moment through your effort , then " Ole ! "
You know , you do the same your dance .
And " Ole ! " You know , you know .
I think , I should be taught .
" Ole ! " You know , just for us , even to have had human and testing tack-tal tack-making .
Thank you .
Thank you .
June Cohen : Ole !
And as you know I 've already talked about some of these projects on the human genome , what can mean and the discovery new set of genes .
We 're now starting a new persual , we started digitalize biology and now we 're coming from that digital code we 're both in a new phase of biology , designing and synthesizing life .
We always tried to ask a big questions .
What is life ? " What is life ? " It 's something that many biologists have tried to understand var vars .
We tried different approaches , we reduced to the minims .
We 're digitalizing from almost 20 years .
When we sequenced the human genome was treated to go from the analome of the world of biology in the digital world .
Now we ask us : can we regenerate life , or create new life from this digital universe ?
This is the map of a small organism , Mycoplasma genitalium , which is the smallest genome of the smaller genome between the lab .
And we tried to reduce the genome of the genome to create one more small .
We can eliminate a hundred genes of genes about 500 that are here .
But when we look at his metabolic map , it 's relatively simple than our .
And I think , this is simple .
But when we look at all the genes that we can eliminate , one at the time , it 's very unlikely that this can bring to a living cells .
So we decided that the only way that the only way to prove was synthize this chromosoma in a way that we could modify the components to bring some of these fundamental questions .
And so we started the adventure of " CCCCan Can we synthesize a chromosoma ? "
Can you get the chemistry to make these big molecules that we never have been able to create before ?
And in case , we can we make a chromosoma ?
A chromosoma is just a piece of inert chemicals .
The speed speed we 're able to digitalize life is growing to requency .
Our ability to write the genetic code , instead , procrete rather slowly , but it 's improving .
And our most recent results the bring to a curve curve .
We started over 15 years ago .
The process has required many passages , starting with a bioetics before we started the first experiments .
But we found that synthize DNA is very difficult .
There are tens of thousands of machines in the world that are producing little segments of DNA , long , long , and it 's a degenerative process : the more the segment is longer .
So we had to develop a new method to assembly these framents and correct the mistakes .
And this was our first attempt , to start by digital information of the genome of the genome of the X 174 .
It 's a little virus that kills .
We designed the fragments , actually effective the correction of the mistakes and get a molecule of DNA molecule .
The interesting part is when we took this piece of inert chemicals and we put it in the bacteria , the bacteria have started reading this genetic code and produring the viral particles .
The viral particles have then been require by cells , they go back and they destroyed .
I talked about recent in the oil industry and they 're saying that they 're certainly understood that they have certainly understood this model .
They have reached more than you .
We think that this is a situation where the software can really build his same hardware in a biological system .
But we wanted to do things in big .
We wanted to build the entire chromosoma .
They 're more than 580 mile letters of genetic code .
So we thought of building it in the size of viruses , so that we can change the casssets to understand what the components of a living cells .
The design is crucial , and if we start with digital information in a computer , these must be very accurate .
When we sequenced this genome for the first time in 1995 accurate , it was a mistake for every 10 mile miles .
We found out , 30 mistake . If we had that original sequence , we would never be able to do that work .
One part of the process is to design a long time for 50 letters that are very long as they 're all the other segments of 50 letters to build underneath .
We 're going to try to the only one here .
You probably read that you 're going to read that we 're going to grain of filigate .
And so , we think that we have a genetic code on four letters : At , C , G and Ts .
Three of those letters together code , they 're going to have a specific order of the letters , and there 's a specific order of reading for every friendly minods .
So we can use genetic code to write words , frases , thinking .
What we did at the beginning is to be autographed .
Some have been dollar that wasn 't poem .
We designed these segments to just just one up with me .
There are cizes that repair them and put them .
And we started assembly with the parts , starting with segments from five to seven mile , a thousand leckle , a segments of 24 mile letters in a single letters to them to get 72 mile .
And we 've got these segments in abundance so that we 're trying to reach them that we 're trying to create a very robustog proceding -- as you 'll see in a minute .
We 're trying to self-doing the process .
So , this seems like the tabellone of the basket .
When we get to these very long segments , more than 100 miles , they don 't grow in the directly .
It 's going to be to the modern tools of molecular biology .
So we 've been considered other mechanisms .
We knew another mechanism called a recombination omologa , which in biology is to repair the DNA to repair the segments .
Here 's an example .
This organism , called Deinooothern Deinodurans , it can absorry three million rad rate .
You can see in the superior of the soma is destroyed .
In 12 -- 24 hours is replaced exactly as it was before .
They 're able thousands of organisms that they can do that .
These organisms can sit completely .
They can live under empty .
They 're absolutely sure life in space , and you feel to find new environments of the rich new environments .
And I mean , NASA showed showed that this is .
This is a picture of the molecule that we built using these processes , just using these processes , just using the lappropriate design segments .
The lights assemble them .
This picture wasn 't taken with a microscope , but with a microscope , but with a microscope .
It 's a molecule that we can see the with a microscope .
These are pictures that covers a period of about six seconds .
This is the adveration we 've done a little time ago .
They 're more than 580,000 letters of genetic code .
It 's the largest molecule of a defined structure that ever created by man .
It has a 300 million molecular weight .
If you stamp it with a 10 without spaces , they would like 142 pages , you would just like 142 , you want to be able to transcute this genetic code .
Now , how do we do it work ?
Of course , you tramed a virus is a game from kids .
It 's a little more complicated when you use bacteria .
It 's simpler cells as it 's eucariote like our : you can just summer the nucleo and put one one else , which is basically the process of cloning .
In the archaea bacteria , the chromosoma is integrated inside the cells , but we 've recently demonstrated that we 're able to do a complete trapid of a cell chromosoma from another and activate it .
We 've got a chromosoma by a microbial species .
The two are different as men from the topes .
We added some gene more in a way that you can decide what to this chromosoma .
The gave has the enables to kill all the proteins .
And when we put it in the cells was stupendomness -- and you 'll appreciate our own pain -- the new chromosophisticatome -- the new cell .
And we started thinking that we couldn 't go beyond , but we tried to spinger us in there .
This is one of the major mechanisms .
We found that a lot of species have added a second or a third chromosoma somewhere , adding in a second thousand new tracks to that species .
So who thinks about evolution as a only gene at the time you have not understood a lot of the biology .
They 're going to be called " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " "
The chromosoma that was in the cells .
The cellphone chromosoma that we have inserit-shape .
He 's expressed , and he recognized the other chromosoma , the other thing as the summer material , and we 've recognized it with only the cells and the new chromosoma .
And it became blue because of the genes we 've inserted .
And in a short leverage of time , all the characteristics of a species , you know , and it 's transformed all in a new species , based on the new software that we put in the cells .
All the proteins have changed , the proteins have changed , and when we read the genetic code exactly exactly what we have moved you .
Now , this may seem to be genetic , but altering the software , we can change the things in a kind of fundamental way .
Now , I 've already explain that you don 't talk about genesesis -- but of progress to go from three million years and a half million years , and I said that maybe we 're going to create a new version of Cambrian explosion where they will create new species on this digital species .
Why do that ?
I think that 's pretty obvious when we think about our necessities .
We 're going to go from six billion and a half billion people in the next 40 years .
Just to give an example : I was born in 1946 .
Now there are three people on the planet for each one existing in 1946 .
We 're having problems now to find food , fresh water and clean , medical water and weline for six billion and a half billion people .
It 's going to be more than that we can do that for nine billion .
We use more than five billion carbon , more than 30 billion fuel , more than 30 billion baries .
That means a million baries a day .
When we try to find biological processes , or any kind of process to replacing them , it 's going to be a huge challenge .
We have to keep the whole emission of CO2 from these materials that are going to end in the atmosphere .
At day today , thank you to scientific discoveries in the world , we have a database with about 20 million genes , and I like to think they 're the designed understanding of the future .
The electronics is only one dozen about a dozen of components , and think about how many different things are coming out .
Our limitations are principle from the biological reality and our imagination .
Now we have a techniques , thank you very quickly synthetization , in fact , we can create what we call a combinatory genomics .
We can build a big robot that can produce a big robot that can produce a million chromosomes per day .
Think of processing these 20 million genes or to get to get to get to get the processes to produce eight or drugs , new vaccines , we can change , we can change , thank you to a small team , and create more biology now that in the last 20 years of science .
And it 's just a standard writing .
We can choose for the possibility of survival , chemical production or carbons , chemical production ,
This is a instantaneous instantaneous software programs we 're working on to be able to seats us and design species to make us a computer .
Well , we don 't necessarily know how they 're going to be .
We know exactly how it 's their genetic code .
We 're now four-generation fuels .
You also saw you that extract ethanol was a finished experiment .
We have carbons of second and third generation that will be done enough from the sugar to the higher carbons as the eight-value or different kinds of butanthrogate .
But the only way the biology that we have a big impact without increasing more than the cost of food and limitaren the cost of the food and limitaren the cost of the first , where we 're working on to design cells that can reach this , and we think we have the first fuel that we have the first carbons of quarters in about 18 months .
The solar light solar with CO2 is a metodo-- but in our discoveries , we found different metods .
This is a organism we described in 1996 .
It 's going to live in the ocean , about 2,500 feet of the temperature of the water .
They create meter from CO2 using hydrogen molecular hydrogen as a source of energy .
We 're trying to understand if we can incanalate CO2 , which can easily be translated tramed tubes , conververting that CO2 in carbons , to drive this process .
So , we think that we could be able to increase what the basic question of what 's the basic question of " which is we have a dry goal of the whole thing is we can be able to replacing the whole oil industry .
Exactly . If you don 't do that from TED , where you can ?
It would be a main fundamental source of energy .
And also , we 're working for using the same metods to create vaccines .
You saw this year with influence , we 're always forth of a year and with a dollar when it 's going to find the right win .
I think what you can change with combinable vaccines in anticipate .
And that 's how the future could start to look changing , now , the tree of evolution , accelerating evolution with synthetic bacteria , arches , I would be able to be changing .
We are so much from improving people .
Our discover is to do a long way to live long enough to try to do it . Thank you very much .
And I 'll just just show you , the faster , the most quickest possible , some fundamental work , of the new technology that we took to Microsoft a year ago . This is Seadragon . This is Seadragon .
It 's a environment where you can interact is in local level that you can interact with a huge amount of data visual data .
We 're seeing a lot of gigabyte digital photographs with a kind of a kind of zoom and continuous , for a sandandwaving and continuous , and we 're going to be able to be .
And not matter how big the amount of information that we see , how big the amount of information that we see , how big these collapses or the pictures .
Most are common photographs , but this for example is a scansion of the library from the Library of Congress , and reenter the gyxial , and recenter in the gamel of 300 megaxels .
It doesn 't make any difference because the only thing that you have the prestation of a system like this is the number of pixel on your screen in any time . It 's also a very flessible architecture .
This is a book , an interior data , not of pictures .
This is the desolated Casa desolate Casa .
And to show you that it 's just about the textbook and not images , we can do something like that , to actually actually actually see that it 's a real real representation of the tbook , not a picture .
It 's a little artificial way to read an electronic book .
Not a advice .
This is a more realistic example . It 's a number of the Loodian .
Every image is the beginning of a sexiety .
And you really give you the pleasure and the beautiful experience of reading the version of a magazine or a quotidate , which is for a molteplus , which is for a molteplus .
We also did something with the corner of this number in particular , the Looods .
We 've created a higher advertising ads -- much more higher than what you use in a normal advertising -- and we insert of the content .
If you want to see the characteristics of this automobile , you can see here .
Or other models , or even the techniques .
And this really shows some of these ideas to eliminate the limitations of space on the screen .
We hope that that 's going to be able to end to a pop-up , and other porcheries , you don 't have to be necessarily .
Of course , the map is one of the most obvious applications for this kind of technology .
And on this is not going to lose time , if I don 't say we have contribute to give you in this field .
These are all the streets in the United States , on the United States , on a NASA geospacecual picture .
So , we 're going to do something else .
This is actually actually , you know , you can go to see it .
It 's a project called Photosynthy , which combine two different technologies .
One is Seadragon and the other is a very interesting visual computers that made by Noah Snavely , a student of Washington , with Steve Seitz Rick Seitz Seitz Rick Seitz Szeliski Rick Szeliski .
And it 's from the Web , managon by Seadragon .
You can see it when we do this kind of screen , we can go from one image to the other image to the other image and have this kind of experience to the multiple .
But the space collocation of the pictures here has actually a meaning .
The algorithms of computers have recorded these pictures together , so that you can see the real places that I imagine -- all of these pictures , so you know , you know , you know , you know , the laghi Blagne in the Roccies -- you 're screamed . Here you see all of a slide or imagining panorites , and these things are all the spactical level .
I don 't know if I have time to show you some other environment .
There are a few more space .
I want to go directly to one of the original data from Noah-- and this is from a previous priction of Photosynthesus that we 've done for the first time , I think of that 's really the key to show you what I think is really the key key to show you what I think is really the key key to show you what I think is really the key to look at the environments we put in the environments .
We had to worry about legal aspects and so on .
This is a reconstruction of Notre Dr. Do you 're in the Flickr . Bao digitch Notre D. And you get pictures of the types of the campus and you get pictures of these arange cones , other campus and saying . And so , you know , you have a picture that 's discovered to this model .
So they 're all pictures from Flickr and they 're all related to this way .
And it 's possible to be able to be able to be able to be able .
You know , I would never thought to end up to work for Microsoft .
It 's very gratifying to get this kind of acacoenhed here .
I think you can see that it 's a lot of different types of photos : from those of the cell phones to the professional SLR , a number meaningly meaning , put together in this environment .
And if I can , I try to look for those more strange .
Many are blown by faces , etc .
And somewhere here is a series of photographs --
This is a poster Notre Dame recorded .
We can go from the poster to the physics of this environment .
The essential point is we can do things with social environment . This is now taking data from the whole thing . This is now taking data from the whole stage , from the whole stage of view -- and to all those data together .
All those pictures become connected together , the more of the parts of the parts .
You have a model of the land model .
Think about this as a prolunging of Stephen Lawler on the virtual Earth .
It 's something that grows in complexity as people use it , and the whose people are using it , and the advantage to the use .
They 're married with inserites from other people .
If you get the idea of to contrast all these sunts saying the name , my name , my picture of Nototter D. Do suddenly requies of all those data , and I can use how to use it as a point of enresping for imum to be a picture of a cross-to-to-to-user experience , and cross-user .
Of course , a consequence of all that are very very , very much elaborated models of every interesting part of the Earth , collected , and that 's not just going to live and satellite images and similar images and similar images and similar imagination .
Thank you .
CA : I realized what your software is going to get to do is that your software is that at a certain point , in the next few years , all the photographs are going to share anybody in the entire world are going to be practically related together ? What are you going to do is that ?
BAA : Yeah . What 's doing is basically , you know ,
It 's creating hyperlink , if you want , you know , in the pictures .
And it 's doing it in the base of the pictures .
The thing is really interesting if you think about the rich information semantes that many of these options that many of these possible images .
And as you do a research of the web , you have a phrase and the text on the web page has a lot of information about the picture .
Now , what if that picture is you connect to all your pictures ?
So the amount of semantics and the amount of rich is that it 's really huge . It 's a classical classical classical .
CA : Blaise , it 's really incredible . Compliments .
BAA : Thank you very much .
One of the main pleasure when you travels and one of the ethnographics of the ethnographics is that we have not forgotten the antial traditions , between who has the past in the wind , you touch the wind , you touch the stage of the plants , the guess of the plants , the guess of the plants .
Basti thinking that the sciamans Jaguar viach us beyond the Via Lattea , or that the monites of Inuit still still collies , or that in Himalaya , the good good damage , and that the idea that the most important , that the world that the most important important , but that the idea that the world that we live in a sense , but it 's just a model , but it 's just a model , but it 's just a model , but it 's just a model ,
the consequence of a particular adapative choices that our adapative choices that our race has done , well , many generations ago .
And , of course , we all share the essential tracts .
We all prove . We all probelieve .
We are subjects to start .
We have to require the inexorability of death , so we don 't surprising us if we 're paying and wheeless --
We all have an art .
What it 's the particular one of the song , the rhythm of the dance of every culture .
It doesn 't matter that they 're the Penan forests of the Borneo , or the follow Voodoo 's driving Kenya , or the deserrial Kenya in Kenya in Kenya , or a ball of the Ande , or a cameras .
He was my journey companion in the desert a month ago , or a yak in the yak of the yak parator of the world 's valuable , the world 's mother 's dead .
All these people teach us that are other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , other ways of moving in the world .
And , if you think , if you think a moment , it 's a concept that it can give you hope .
And together , the myriades of the world create a spiritual life of spiritual and cultural life that has a planet of the planet and is important for the well-being of the planet as a biosphere .
And you can think of this cultural ragnostic ragnostic , and you can defining the etnosphere , and you can defining the whole concepts , dreams , intuitions , intuitions , intuitions , intuitions bring into being from the human imagination from the alba of consciousness .
The etnosphere is the fantastic patriage of humanity .
It 's the symbbol of what we 're and what we can be in how inquisitive .
And because it was very much very , very , very , very quickly , as it has been very quickly as well as a fast as quickly as well .
Nobody biologist , for example , it would say that 50 percent of all the species was or is on the oror the one of the most apocalm , just in the most apocalm field -- in the most apocalm field -- and you don 't even even near the most optimistic issue -- that the cultural diversity .
The indiculous of that is , of course , the language persites .
When you 're born 6,000 languages on this planet .
A language is not just a language of a vocabulary or a series of rules .
A language is the spring of human spirit .
It 's the half of the animal that the animal of every culture is in the material world .
Every language is a forest , a strong backin , a thought , a thought , a ecosystem of spiritual .
And of those 6,000 languages , as we 're here in Monterey , at least half the half of the horecchies of kids .
They 're not teaching kids , the kids , which means , not not the things , which is already death .
What is there 's more sad than being being being being done by silence , the last to talk a language , of being the last to talk a language , the wisdom of the kids ?
This is a little bit of a state of someone in the world every two weeks : every two weeks a half weeks , a one old , and door with the old syllabe and door with the ancient ball .
And I know somebody 's going to say , " Don 't it much ?
The world would be not a better place if we all talk ? " Well , let 's talk about the same language ? "
We talk about kogs .
You 're going to be a tract thing that you can 't talk about your language .
I would like to do a journey through the etnosphere --
a little journey in the etnosphere to give you a asp of what we 're losing .
Many of us forget that when I say , " different ways of there are really different ways of exists .
We take for example this baby Barasana , in the Sewish , the popular anacond , who creates the myth of the anaconda fire , which creates the myth of the west slats in the west sandwers .
It 's a popular people who 's not able to distinguish color blue color from the green because you 're identified in the forest , which depends on which people depends .
They have a strange language and a matrimonial rule , called " exogamia " : " You have to marriage a different language .
All that has radical past mythological , yet the particized that is that in these extensive families that they 're talking about six or seven languages because of marriages of marriages .
They 're going to listen and then they start talking .
We take one of the most interesting tribe that I lived , the Waorani of Ecuador nortor north , an incredible popular people who had the first contacts in 1958 .
In 1957 five missionaries have been trying a conduct that a made mistake .
They did over the photographs that they rate them in a picture that they were ring them in a lot of people who were going to think that this popular forest had never seen anything bi-dimensional forest .
They collected the photo the Earth , they spend up a shape or a shape , and not finding anything , they were going to be treated with the horg , and they killed the five missionaries with the lance .
But Waorani not only killer .
They killed them between them .
54 percent of the mortality was caused by their same .
We 've been rised to eight generations and we found two natural death and when we 've been insist to know , they had a lot of them was invectuated so that he had been invectured so that he killed him him . And then they killed him him him .
The hunters were able to recognize the animal urine animal urine from 40 steps and recognize the species .
In the early ' 80 , I was assigned a very interesting task when my professor of Harvard , I was asked to Haiti to go to Haiti to the society of Duvalier and Tonton Macooler and Tonton Macoutes and Tonton Macoutes and Tonton the bottom of the bottom of the bottom .
And to give a sense of miracologist , I would have to understand Vodoun culture , and the Voodoo not magic .
It 's pretty much about a metapphysical vision of the world .
Many interesting .
If I ask you to tell you the big religions of the world , what would you say ?
Cristianity , Islam , Buddhiddism , Ebraism , etc .
A continent is always left out , thinking that the sub-Saharan Africa has no religious feels . And it 's not the other that the distilside of these religious concepts of the religious concepts in the tragic tragic concepts of the schiragic conception of the slavery .
What makes the interesting voodoo is the intended up between life and death .
So the vision they hidden the spirits .
The spirits can be invoced by Grande Acqua , they respond to the dance and they replace to the race of the vial way that for a short , the way that 's going to be the followed .
So , for this voodooists , you know , " You have to go to a church of God .
We say in the temple and we deventiate God . "
And from the moment you 're rid , is the spirit that you drive to you get bad ?
So you 're going to these incredible events : follow voodoor in the state of trance that touches are impuntizing , which is pretty strong the power of the mind when it 's catalyzed in a state of extreme .
And all the people I lived the most extraordinary of which I lived the most extraordinary Kogi of Sierra Nevada Santa Marta , in the Santa Marta Colombia .
The major civilization of the tyrangn civilization that once they were living on the caraibia in the conquatist , the people were ritiated on the vulchanical massive plants that was in the vulcanic plants .
In a drug continent macked , this popular , this popular is never been conqued by the way .
But they 're now now governed by a clero , but their formation is really extraordinary .
The young people followed them from the families to three or four years , and live secreates in a world , and they live secreates in a world , and share handed to the base of the glacial glacial for 18 years .
Two dy-nine years choices to reproduce the nine months of the nine months of the race of the mother , now are metaphor horically in the Grande Mother .
And so , for this time , they 're acculturate to their society , values that predict their pyylous , and just their pyyes and just like the cosmic balance -- or to say the cost of the cost of the ecological balance .
At term of this incredible initiation , they 're suddenly lying out and for the first time in their own , at the age of 18 years , they see a dry . And in that active consciousness of the first butter , when the sunnice is the valuable of beautiful , everything that 's coming back , everything that 's learned in the whole thing that they 've learned in the whole thing . And the pret one of his splendor . And he says , and says , and he says ,
" Where ? Right ? I said ,
It 's amazing . It 's now to you protect it . "
They call it greater brothers and say that we , the minors , we 're the pevolution of the world .
This is very important .
When we think of Ingene and invote Rousseau and the old story of the wild noble , which is a razoom concept , which is a razoom , we say that these people are closer to the Earth of us .
The Ingenes are not not feeling as as a nostalation .
There 's no space for these things in the Asmat the Asmat or winds of Tibet , but thank you to the time and ran , they created a mystical mystics of the Earth 's based not the concept of the neighbors , but on a very neighbor intuition of the Earth can live only because it 's infused by consciousness .
What does that mean ?
And I mean a little girl who 's growing up to credate that mountain is a spiririt of Apu who will be a destiny human being dested . And it 's going to have a different human being deeply different and have a little bit of a boy in the place that grow that growing a mountain of rocks that growing a mountain of rocks that will be taken .
That 's the dimora of a spirit or a mineral , it 's irrelevant .
What 's interesting is the metaphor that defines the relationship between the individual and the natural world .
I grew up in the forests of Columbia credly credying that forests to be cuted .
And that has made me a different human being from my friends Kwautl who believe that the forests are the forests of Hukukuk and the bis histored by the paradise and the batch of the world , spiriters live in the world , spiriters , spiriters that will live in the Hamatsa .
If you start to consider that these cultures can create different reality , you can start to understand some of them , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you can create different ,
I 've been shown this picture to open in the nordocccil in the nordocction .
Mayahuash , some of you 've heard about the ayahuash , the most powerful psycotive substance .
What makes it fascinating the ayahuasca is not the major potential of the substance , but his elaboration . It 's composal . It 's composal by two elements .
On one side , this lian legacy lian a-carboline , harmful and harmful , harmolines , harmful .
And I take the only plants , you have a blum bage that altera little consciousness , but it 's measure with the leaves of a coffee of the coffee family told Psychathrown .
This plant is a powerful plant triptamine , very similar to serotonin , dimethoxyptamine-5 , methoxypttine-5 , methoxt-pamine pline .
If you ever see Yanomami , you 'll just pull up on the birth of the birth that do from a different species , anchy methoxydimethoxttrypamine .
And I think that poor polve that 's a little bit like to be disappeared by a bunch of painting painting and land on a a sea of electricity . You Risate not creates a distorsion of reality ; creates the dissolution of reality .
I was often a lot of my professor , Richard Evan Shultes , the man who has taken the psychcholic fungus , with his discoveries of the hallucinogens in the 1930s .
I think my tesesis , you can 't classify these triptamine as you can hadn 't even to be hallucinated .
It 's possible to be just if you get them to be able to others with the key submit for the MAO .
Now , the beautiful , the beauty : Is beauty that they find in this lian lian lian area of MAr , the same kind of necessary to potential the tripal . The question of spontaneous : in a flying of 80,000 species of plant , how do these people do have been butting two morphofolds like these people , they create a biochemical version that 's dden soil that 's daim that 's dry to the submmm of the parts ?
We use the big eupherror , and the mistake , which can reveal infrumped .
But if we ask the Indian , they 'll tell us , " The plants are talking about . "
What does that mean ?
This tribes , the Cofan , has 17 variety of ayahuasks , which are nettly nally in the forest , and that we 're going to go into the species .
If you ask them how they 're going to be able to tell us , " I thought , " I was thinking about it , " I was thinking about it , " I said , " No . "
The solution is : You take the 17 variety of a moon , and each one will give a different door .
And this is not a laurea Harvard , but it 's much more interesting to contact the stones .
Now , [ [ applaushed ] the problem is that even the ones of us who have to heart popular , they find them paintings are painting , but somehow redots to the margins of the history of the respect of our world , and pass beyond .
In fact , the 19th century , it 's not going to remind , it doesn 't be reminded by his guerre or technologies , but rather as the thing that we were stopped and active acactively accepted or a passively accepted , the problem of the planet . Now the problem is not the change .
All the cultures through the centuries have been involved in a dance for new possibility .
And the problem is not technology .
The Indians Sioux have no stopped to be Sioux when they put up up a lot of people like Americans don 't have stopped to be Americans when they put in the horal and calute .
It 's not the change or the technology that are integrity of the ethnosphere . It 's the power .
The during the domination of domination .
And if you give a look at the world , you 'll find that these are not destinated cultures .
They 're living and spint dynamics out of the hyper-identify forces that go beyond their ability to adaptation .
I know that 's a disboscaming in the eat of Penan --
a popular nobble , in the west airplane , in the west airplane , a popular , which lived in the forest to a generation , and now reduced to the servitus , where you can see the river 's river , where you can see the fiures inquinquinquinquinquined by the limo that seems to Meridional Meridional , where you were nice sleep , where you know the horizonds ,
With the wood style with the subject to the forest .
Or , in the case of Yanomami , are the disease that I 've come to the discovery .
If we move on on the mountains of Tibet , where I 'm doing a lot of research , you 'll see the hard hard hard of politics .
As you 'll know the genocide , the physical extinction of a popular popular , but the initiation of life , but the destruction of life of a popular population , not just as a popular , but to say it 's not just a celebrate , because it makes part of the developing development .
And you can 't understand the suffering of Tibet until you go from the beginning .
I 've been 6,000 miles from Chengdu in Chengdu in China through Tibet , I get to Lhasa with a young colleague , but only came to Lhasa a young colleague , but only came to Lhasa , I realized what we feel .
6,000 sacres reduced in your poor or cenjoy .
1.2 million people killed by the military Revolution .
The father of this guy was ascriticized at the Panchen Lama .
That 's been killed by Chinese invasion .
Her , I was worst with Santity during the diaspora that has taken people in Nepal .
Her mother was imprigioned and his cold was rich .
It was brought to the age of two years from the age of two birds under his gonna because it couldn 't have living without him .
The sister , which did the same , it was mit in reducation field .
A day he had inavailable in a willing fascinating a Mao and , for this transgression , was mit to seven years .
The Tibet of Tibet is being inoverwhelming , but the reesterday of the people is from tener present .
At the end , everything is reduces a choice .
Do we want to live in the world world of monoonia or do we want to accoat the world 's policy ?
The big anthropologist , Margaret Mead , before he said that his bigger fear was that , in our way to this frightening view of the world , we don 't just see the entire gamorous gam of human imagination reduced to a limitation of thinking , but one day we 'll see that there were other possibility .
And it 's umillion years old .
The Neolitics Rivolution , who gave us the agriculture , which has done us underlie to the seed of the seed of the skid , creating the bage of the skid , creating the hierarchy of specialization , and we talk about 10,000 years ago .
The modern world industry has been 300 years old .
That evening the story not suggests that we have the answers to all the challenges we 're going to have to deal in the millennia to come .
When you get these myriades of the world is asked what it means to be humans , they respond with 10,000 different voices .
And it 's in these answers that we all all have to risk the possibility of being what we 're , a conscious species , which has to make all the people and all the giars can fire . And there 's great moments of optimism .
I 've been shown this picture on the northern extended up the North island , when I went to the whales with the Inuit , Olaya , Olaya , Olaya , Olaya , Olaya , Olaya , and he told me the wonderful story of his grandfather .
The downnets was not always given to the people in the Inuit and in the ' 50s to stbilikes our sometist , we gave them them in colonies .
The grandfather of this man refuted to go .
The family , I teming her life , and I 'll take all the time , and all his attle attitudes .
You have to know that Inuit not temon the freer , they exploit .
The pattins of slete origin were made of fishes .
The grandfather of this man didn 't have been untimight or from the libraries or from the libraries .
It 's sgattaiolled , you calculated the pantalone , and defecated in your hand . When I did it , you get them to do it , they worked a lamp .
He 's spring on the dog of this cocket collect and when he became solid , he killed a dog .
He 's been taken the dog and created a brillighter , with the scrats , he made a sleep , and he imbrilliant a bunch , and he 's disappeared on the banking , he 's going on the block .
We want to talk about cavarself-with nothing ? You know ?
In 1999 , the Sapapril government rel has replaced the total control of an area of a larger territory of a bigger territory of the California and Texas mess .
It 's called their new pools . It 's called Nunavut .
It 's a independent territory . They 're going to be all the mineraries .
One of the one of the natione-state of how a natione-state can recognize with his people .
And , finally , I think it 's pretty obvious at least to who we have been in these remote places of us was in these remote song of the planet , realized that they don 't have remote .
For someone 's home .
They represent severtions of the human imagination that are rising at the daily . And for all of these kids , as dreams of these kids , as dreams of the hope .
From , we know , National Geographic we 're convinced that politicians will never come anything .
We think the polemies --
[ Applausi is not persuasive , but we think that the stories can change the world , and maybe we 're better institution to tell the stories of the world . Every month of our site has to be 35 million visites .
156 countries transmit to our television canal canal canal .
Our rivies are thletters from millions of people .
Our work is to traveling in the ethnosphere to bring our audience in wonderful cultural places that will go through how they 're going to be able to have seen and , they will be able to be able to be able to be able to reveal in the anthropology : the world of exists to have to find a life style and multicultural style world , and we have to find a life in a pluralist and multicultural world in a life in a pluralist and the way ,
where all the people wisdom of all people can contribute to our collective well-being collective well-being .
Thank you .
I 'm going to talk about some things that I wrote in this book that I hope you 've already heard and I 'm going to try to prove some some of the colleague , in the case not noticable them .
I would like to start with what I call the official dogma official dogma .
The official dogma official dogn ?
The official dogma official , the Western official dogma , the official dogma , " If we want to maximum the well-being of our citizens . "
The reason is , from one side , in fact that freedom is in itself a value , is very precious , it 's a very precious , essential for human beings .
On the other one is that if we 're free , each of us can act for all of us can act for all that that massive to do everything that massive , no one that we decide .
The way to massive freedom is massive to choice .
More choices people have , more they 're free , and more , is their own freedom , the more of the freedom , the more they are .
This , I think , is so deeply radical in the society that nobody would dream to put it in doubt .
And it 's also roaded in our lives .
I 'm going to show you some examples of what the progress has made possible .
This is my supermarket . It 's not particularly big .
I lose a simple note on the injury for injury .
In my supermarket , there are 175 conditions , not contate the 10 variety of the extraverage , and 12 of whales and 12 12 of whsical oil that you can buy a huge number of conditions in the increscracy that one of 175 proning to your degrees .
That 's how supermarket .
Then you go to the store of electronic electronic to buy a stereo : cases , the CD lector , radio , radio , radio , the race , the race .
And in this single store store store , there 's a big number of audio components .
We can do six million and a half million different combinations using components that there are in a store .
You have to admit that there 's a lot of choice .
Altri : the world of communications .
Once , when I was a child , you could get all the services telephone services , and they were fornitable , and they were fornitable .
He had a phone , you didn 't buy it .
A consequence of that , the phone was not break .
These temples are gone .
We have a nearly variety of telephones , especially between cell phones .
Here 's the cell phones .
My favorite is that in the middle , MP3 , tone , the hidden and forced to the brulele cool .
If you don 't have seen the store under home , you 're just just just store up .
And what happens is that people go into the store and does this question . And you know what the answer is . And you know what the answer is , " No . "
It 's not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn 't do too much .
So , in other things of life that are much more important than the acquired of the acquified , you know , the same thing is explosion of choices .
Assistence : no more in the United States that you go from the doctor and the doctor , the daily say what you have to do .
Instead , you go from the doctor , and the doctor tells you , " Well , we could do A B , or B , " Are you wish , " By these weless and risks . What you want to do ? "
You say , " Doctor , what should I do ? "
And the doctor says , " A has these wells and these answers , and B has these well-risks . "
" What do you want to do ? "
And you rebits : " Doctor if she was me , what would you do ? "
And the doctor : " But I 'm not . "
The result of the result of the malate , " " " autonomy . " It looks like a beautiful thing .
But actually it 's not that one to move the weight and responsibility to make decisions from someone who knows something , which is a doctor , to someone else you know , and almost certainly , and so not in the ideal condition to make decisions the patient .
There 's a huge marketing of products , drug to people like me and you , that if you think , it 's not a sense , because if you think you can 't buy them .
But if we can 't buy them , why public icizate them ?
The answer is that they want to dommorning , we call the doctor to ask them to change the rich .
And that 's a fundamental identity is our orever horever is a question of choice , as you see in this jobs . " We don 't want to force kids . They 're going to give them to the right now . " We need to invent . " We need to invent . "
And we can reinvented how much we get there .
That means that every morning , you have to answered , you have to decide that kind of person you want to be .
I 'm going to family and marriage , a time the common , a common time , which was almost that , it was that there was a most soon possible , and it was that it was being marriage , and it was starting to be the most soon possible .
The only verage choice was with who , not when you , and even what to do after .
Ose , it 's really really really , to play .
I teach students very smart , and I do 20 percent of the work at least than a time .
And it 's not because they 're not good , not because they 're not not because they 're not very good .
but why am I impensierites , I mean , " Would I married or not ?
" Do I have I think before I have to think before or to kids or career ? "
They 're logies of logiving oranant .
And they try to answer these questions , even though this is not to be able to be able to be able to do , even even getting a bel vote to my examples .
And they have to do that . They 're important questions .
Now , the work : we 're lucky , like Carl underolineer , because technology allows us to work every minute , every day , from every day , from the planet , except from the Hotel Randolph .
And I 'm talking about a corner , and I don 't tell anyone , where WiFi works .
I don 't know , I want to use it .
What does this mean , this incredible freedom of choice that we have to continue , continuously , in every moment , if we have to work or not .
We can go to see our son playing hot , with the cell phone , the cell phone in a pockle , the Blackberry in the other , and the notebook , typically , on the gock .
And even though I 'm all spent , every minute that we see our son , we 're also asking the partners , we 're also asking , " Do I have to respond to this called ? "
" Do I have to say to this email ? I got to habel this letter ? "
And even when the answer is " no , " all this makes the experience of your own son very different from what it would be in other conditions .
So , from any part , we look , little , little big , materials and big , materials and life is a question of choices .
Once the world was this : Ovable , there were some possibility , but not all was a question of choice .
The world of today looks like this : The dilemma is , " Is that a positive thing , or negative ? "
The answer is Sundry .
The positive laten latest latest latory .
And all this choice compories two actually negative effect on people .
The first , paradoxtively , is that it makes a paralysis .
And so , you know , it 's really hard to do .
I give you an example : a conduct on the flan plan of voluntement .
A colleague has had access to the Vanhealthy data , the giant society of pension , with about a million clients in 2,000 different companies .
What she found is that for every 10 solutions that are offert in more , the percentage of two percent .
With 50 funds , there 's 10 percent of adhhesions than when they 're only only five . Why ?
Because with 50 four-founds of which choice , is maledly difficult decide , and choice is just a lot of choice ,
And to ask the tomorrow , and I still ask tomorrow , and of course , I would never come .
You know that it doesn 't just mean that these work from old who are going to be food for dogs because they don 't have enough money , even wants to say that the decision is so host that allose the funds of the dator of the work .
I don 't participating , they 're losing until five thousand dollars a year from the work , which would be very well .
So , the paralysis is a consequence of having too much choices .
And I think it makes the world like that .
" And to finish , " for ethchup , " or maionese ? "
You 're going to take the right decision , if it 's for the right ethernity , right ?
You don 't want to choose the wrong wrong , and you know the wrong condition .
So this is the first effect . The second one is that even though we can avoid the paralysis and do a choice , we 're less submit from the result of how we 're going to be done with less options .
And this is a different reasons .
One of these is that with many conditions , you know what you 're going to choice , if you buy one and it 's not perfect , it 's not easy to imagine that you could have been better . And what happens is that the alternative , you know , the alternative imaginative ative ative assuddenly decreasing with the soddisfrication , and the redit , and the rimping is that it 's going to be better . And what 's going on ,
And even when it was a good decision .
More choices are , more choices than any detecting detail than any detail that 's insodatives .
And also , there 's what economists call expensive .
Dan Gilbert has clear very well stamattine as the value of things that we 're depends on what we 're confronted .
And the rest , when there 's a lot of options , it 's easy to be the active characteristics of the showing of alternative alternative arrow and be less sodatives .
Here 's an example . I 've been schools with all the ones that are not New York .
But that 's what you would probably think .
There 's this couple of Hamptons .
A lussilver place .
It 's all about splendida . It 's all about them .
Not any . But what he thinks is , " Well , sick , sick . "
" Everybody neighbors in Manhattan is . "
" I could talk about your own own home . "
And it 's going to two weeks and seeing the idea that it 's losing -- every day -- the possibility of parking where it wants .
The constoopportunities deminate sodatify for what we have , even when choice was a cell .
And the more they are the options that we have to consider , the more the active features will return to us to be able to be constopile .
Here 's another example .
This is a lot of things .
It 's about living the moment , and maybe living slowly .
But the most important thing is you choice , you know , you 're not doing other .
The things that we don 't want to be so much attractive that can make less attractive what we do .
Third point : spiral growing of expectations .
I tried this on my skin buying a new couple of jeans .
I 'm almost always jeans .
Once the jeans were just like a guy , you buy them and besty , they were discomodissies , just after having them a life and work with a lot of times , they were starting to go well .
So , I went to buy a couple of a few old when the old who had gone , and I said , " I need a couple of jeans , this is my cutter . "
The committer told me , " Looks ?
Do you want to the cernier or the buttons ? " Stonebottles ? "
" Looks ? "
" Do you want to get them or stretch ? Bil bla bla -- " Continuated to elencounter .
I was sbalord , and after a little bit , I could say , " I want the guy that was the only guy -- which was the only guy who was the only guy who was the only guy , and I tried to say , " You all jeans , and then I came out of the jeans that I ever had .
It was the massive . I had the whole choice .
But I felt worse .
Why ? I wrote a whole book to understand it .
The reason I was worse that I was worse with all that choices were very high , the jeans had to be perfect .
I was going to start with a minme . I didn 't expect to be just a guy , but when I saw one one of 100 different , steps , at least a kind of had to be perfect .
What I was buy , but not perfect .
After I had to talk about what I was trying to do is to be insodated in confronted to expectations .
The add of the people 's lives of the people don 't do that to increase the expectations that these are respecting with the etheless of the same .
And this will protend to least satify , even when the results are good .
None in the world of marketing and realize .
Because if they knew it , you don 't know what I 'm talking about .
The truth looks like this .
" You were better when you were worse . " The reason that was better when you were worse was that when you were worse was even even when you were worst surprised .
Odly day , the world we live in -- opulent , citizens with the expectancy of perfeeding -- the massive that we can hope is that things to the altel altel .
You never have surprised to be surprised because your expectations , my expectations , I 'm ingigantic .
The secret of happiness -- what you 're here -- is , " Basasically " You want . "
I mean , small , I 'm really really married and my wife is really married and my wife is really really amazing .
I couldn 't do that , I couldn 't do , I didn 't account .
But it 's not always a bad thing .
And finally , a consequence of buy jeans that when you have that kind of jeans is that when you 're not satic , and you ask , " Why ? "
" Who is responsible ? " , the answer is clear .
The world is responsible . What could I do you ?
When you have hundreds of kinds of jeans , and you buy one one insodatisfacing , and you ask who is responsible , it 's just clear that responsible you .
You could do better .
With hundreds of variety of available , there are not scused for insuccess .
So when people take decisions , even though the result is the result , you feel insodatives , they 're unsatives , they 're sitting in their own .
In the last few years , the depression is exploded in the industry .
I think a significant factor -- not the only one , but important -- of this honent wave is that people have a dollar experiences because standard are too high .
And when they have to explain this situation think that the cold is they think that cold is .
So the final result is that we 're better , objectively , but we feel worse .
Let me remember you remember .
This is the official dogma , what we all take for good and it 's completely fly . It 's not true .
There 's no doubt that a little bit of choice is better that I don 't have any good , but from this not derive that a lot of choice is better than a little bit .
There 's a critical value , I don 't know what it 's .
But I 'm pretty sure we 've super-break , the level where the level that choices are improved .
Now , from the political point of view -- I almost finished -- from the political point , the noction is the followed .
What allows you all this choice in the industrial society is the material recheap .
There are many places in the world , and you know , you know , where the problem is not that they have any any choice .
The problem is that they have too long .
So the way I 'm talking is a malbeing exclusive males of modern , rich , the Western society .
And what it does to do and angry is this : Steve Levitt talabout how much that expensive and discoveries of how much that expensive and the bottom of the boi and undary . It 's a sprecognized . It 's a sprecognized spring of money .
I mean that these choices , complicated and avoid , it 's not that they 're just inuseful .
They 're going to say deleterie .
They do them worse .
If a little bit of what our society in our society allows so they were reversed in those where people have too much more likely to be able to improve but our life .
This is what economists call a parety-of-year-old improve .
A redistributtion of income re-distribute redistribute to poor -- because of this choice in excess that you get back .
And finish , " You can be all you want to become all you want to be . "
You , people of culture , you think , " What do that fish ? "
" It 's obvious that you can 't get anything in a glass box . "
" A castrated , a limited view of the world --
and I 've been interpreted so much , at the beginning .
But then , I think , instead , I realized that that that the short short .
Because the reality of the fact is that if you 're missing the bock , so that , " everything is possible , " You don 't get the freedom . You get the paralysis .
If you break the bock , you know , you can deminate the soddisflies .
You get the paralalist , and you reduced the well-being .
Everybody needs a sphere .
This is almost certainly too , maybe even in the fish , and it 's certainly too .
But the absolutely sphere is a recipe for infelity and , I 'm going to be a recipe for the midden .
Thank you very much .
