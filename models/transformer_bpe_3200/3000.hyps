The year I showed these initional death to show that the box of the box of the box of the U.S. , which for three million years has been a few years of the U.S. S. S. S. , is a very danger of the 19th of the 40 percent .
To this is the sssavity of the problem because it doesn 't do it in the ice of the ice .
The land-rrrent is , in a sense , the custor , the rest of the human human system .
It 's a buth of the inspiring .
The next next is going to be a very very quickly , the ssourney ,
The ice ice ice ice is used in the sourney .
You see , you see it back to the dought .
That 's the ice in the ice , which you 're going to be a buth .
You can see the coddle said , you can see , or or more , or more , or the blood , and that here 's the blood .
In 10 years , it 's so so .
This is a problem because the ridation of the internation or the box of the ocean , where there are very different different of the force of construction , which is a lot of clummmed , and they 're still still still still in the microblood .
I 'm going to be the toxing of the inspiring to the whole thing , that the challengength , which could be able to the point of the point of not on the point of the right right right .
In some of the box in Ariban in Aribbbrought from the water .
The The moundly Katey Walter of the universe , the Agggave a a year , I 've got a team in the box , I 'm going to be able to the last year .
Vo : Wow ! Wore !
A reason is that that this is that that that 's a cover of the Genenon .
This is a bought of the Exyy-year-water .
I had never never never been to be able to be able .
This is the bought Kangerllllloul , in the Genenenon .
If you want to know how to know , the middle of the sorts of the water . But here here here is where the sunch the ssis where the .
These are they 're going to be able .
And the other part of the planet : Antarles , the most great .
The last last last last buted the bunundary , which is the ice of the ice is negation , and that Antarticle , which Antundycle , which is a sundly , is a little bit of the sundly , is going to be in .
Everything in the center of the acacket , like in Genenball .
Himalone of the Halone , the third ird ird ird ird , you see new lagn , you see new years ago .
In 40 percent of the population was the water of the water .
Sulle Anderders : this ice is the cell of this city .
The mounded it is going to be .
But when I 'm going to be the same thing , the same thing to water water .
In Chalialive the near of the British 's a .
The rrrrules are in the cities .
The prevision , as you know , you know , you know ,
The growth th in the world in the world in a little bit of the world .
The wilillived are rementing a little bit of the audience and not the finding .
Frounded the last 30 years of the last 30 years ,
This is a stainable to all of all all of all .
If you look at the stage if you can see the concertainly recognize .
In the last 5 years we have been 70 million of the CO2 . O2 . O2 million million ttond in the ocean , every day .
Look at the Pacific , the Pacific , from the box , and on the writing , and on the source of the parts of the ocean , where there is a construct of the ocean .
The most of the recently , the global global death , and that 's 20 percent , is the 20 percent , is the very much of the rest .
The water is a problem , and the citions is a lot of ssourself .
The United States are one of the United States , with the Cina .
And you have a lot of the other countries to build a lot of the metal al r.
But we 're going to be a change of the right .
These are the moves of the last years and some of the last few few few of the last few of the last .
So every way , there 's a political political political in our Paaaese .
The Internet is a blood of the water have to be 250 million dollars in the last year to get the cool to get the cool , which is a sisisisit .
What I 'm going to do something --
I know Natal Natal , Tennesesesesesnnice , there was a 300---year--year-year---year--year--year-year---year-year-year-year------------year-year---year-year--------
Man you saw the notion .
This is the second second big big baby of the last picture .
It was what happened on Natatatatest .
The box is a general of a general of the box of a buth of a .
Vo : I see the buly cy is a kind of balalala a kind of .
It 's going to be here in America , and it 's our economy .
Frosty the bully is always always the box .
It 's a good bully , I remarkable and the work work .
Gore : Hey is part of the West West West West West .
The most important important important ?
Vo : Don Briting : Sarararly , Sararly : Gore , Harry , Harry , Harry not , Harry , you 're talking about what they 're talking about .
Gore : So the Allililived for the Clililililighter has been a bought .
This is a part of it , it 's a part .
Volo : At the COgy , Cergy , we see the good good good good , as a little bit of the song .
So this is the first ority is investment of the most of money in a great way to get to to get to to get the sourself to get the coveral of the work of the work of the work of the right .
In fact , the buth is not the rent .
We think is a good thing -- it 's a good good good .
So what you don 't be cucucucucucucuririse .
Let 's go to us to us .
Vo : Are the bor : Hbbbbbbbbsite .
So we get a bunch of a building in a building in a tracy of how to be able to the ball .
It 's a little bit ! The rent is a little bit of the technology , but this is the sorts of technology , but this is the cover .
The second of the box is in the ccities of the recently technology , but the global technology , the technology of the technology of the ability of the technology is that you see .
You know , you have a butt : this is the cool technology of the cover .
Gore : Indidied , the alternnative initional the economic is and the economy my .
Volo : Anycle : The The second is , the economy , the economy , the cococococool .
The first thing that the ball of them : our dididible ble , as the blood , as the sourney and the oil is the oil .
Now , I 'm going to be a new , authank it .
Rushed America : 100 percent of the energy , in the didied .
A brought the work , and you get more than the resourself , and help to the reveral reveral recently .
Finally , a solution that we have to solution to solution .
Fist America . SSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
Gore : This is the last time .
Vo : Anyvvement : It 's going to get the power .
One of the most ways of the most of the finding to the end of the planet .
Everything : The future is here .
Everything : Nuues the parents for the parents to work .
Anycle : It 's time . It 's time of it .
Gore : A bold old , you know , " If you want to go to the solar .
If you want to go back , you get up . "
We have to go to the way , it 's going to be .
Thank you very much .
They 're going to talk about a construction of the HC .
And you have to get to the nine to the nice .
So I 'm going to be . And so I know , the other other people were , the HC is the most experiment .
his companies is rereach the cities that were a million million dollars a million million dollars a million dollars -- when it was in 19600 million times in 19600 million times .
So , this is just just just about it .
This is the machine in the Gininspiring .
We have a brought these blood Bang in the riststers .
This is what I work is called AAAAAAASS -- it 's a bam-year--year------------year--year-year-year---year-year-year-4 feet feet and has a bamams .
This is a picture picture of AAAAAS in a build so you can build so you .
Even 10 , the board of the last year we have been a time .
And this was a picture of AAAAAAS .
It 's the blood blood in the force of the box .
It 's a picture of the first of the U.S. , which was all the LC , and in the HC , and in the LC , with a lot of LC , and the fact of HC , and the fact , and the cell of the cell .
In other words , when we see that the 10 of the 10 , we know that the machine , the machine was a great vent .
I don 't know if you do it in the laps of the more , when he said , he said , you know , he said , this blue blue .
What means that we had a construct trual , and it 's a scientific .
I 'm a week after there , there was a problem with the machine , I had a little bit of these brought .
These are the 13,000 ,000 blood the machine is the machine of the resourney .
Now , the technnice of you look at the doul of you look , " is not true . "
And they can do it because when they 're very very dought to the cover .
So , so in the middle , to a majerature , to the space of the space , these blood , these blood can get to the sources can get to the sourney .
In one of the most of the most of the most of the HC , there was a bababy .
So the blood of the hold hold , and 13,000 blood to the recently , I had a saving electrical electrical .
This was the result .
Now , this is still more more than if you think that these magnetnetwork from 20 , and that you 're been about 30 percent .
They are damn about 50 magnetwork .
We had done it .
We have the first time .
So they 're all of them in their own sorts .
I know , the ird of the HC , the LC ,
It 's going to be , and we 're going to get the data to the right right right or , and I put so so our our own own own own own own own own own own own own own own universe .
Now , of course , in a way to the way , these recently reverse the values of the value of the value of the future and the future of the future of the future .
I think that 's so hard , I think that 's going to go and the value of things like the value of how the things like the value of how the value of things like the value of the value of the things like the value of the valvalue of the value of things like the value of the things like the value of things like the value of the value of the value of the things like the same thing is ,
I 'd like to say with the words of a great words of the people who are not the sourney , which is the way , and the fact , in the fact , in the fact , the sourney , the ssssssourney , and he said , " Nael Farel , " Nel , " Niel , " Niel , and the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the world 's not the most of the world 's not the most of the most of the world , and the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the the the the the most of the most of the most of the the the the the the the the the most important thing that the most people who are not the life , and the the the the the the most of the most of the gg
Thank you .
I 'm going to start to think about when , you know , and then the boboard .
And so you know how to get them as you get them , and they 're going to be able to think , and we can think about how to solve the problems and solve to think of the policications .
The reason I 'm going to be able to be able to understand that that we start start to us to us .
So , from the lababy of the force of our internation with objects , and I 'm going to be a confent , and my dden , and my dangel , and if I started , I started a little bit , if we have a computer , when I have a computer , I have a computer , the bunccell of the wwwwriting , and I 'm going to be a bunch of the wwriting , and I can be a a a little bit of the bbunch of the buting , the butt , and I 'm going to be a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a
and it 's like to the rate ?
The question was so interesting that we decided to explain the answer , we build the same thing , we build the Etttable .
In fact , a lot of course , a computer is a computer computer like a computer as a great thing .
In fact , a lot of course , a computer is a computer computer like a computer as a great thing .
And the source you can get with the right , you can see , and they 're going to be a screen and a screen and a screen .
But it 's a lot of the source , as the board , you can get up .
Everything is the example of a new new system of a new system of the information of the information .
And then the most of the source , the most of the movement of the cities , and other , and other other , conconconcerned , and other other people like , the other other , as we can see , and we can see , and we can see the foundation .
I 'm going to be with some example .
This is constructed is configed to show the video : if you see the video , the video , the video , the video video video , and if you 're going to get out of the other other .
These are constructive tive tive of the other .
If you get out , you 're interested to what 's going to do .
If they 're doing it , you can be the water and they can be a little bit .
If they 're doing it , you can be the water and they can be a little bit .
They also have the movement and they 're going to the movation .
And then we have the whole thing that one of the internation of the internation was going to get the data , and to the data , " a bit of the Internet if it was a cell of the right .
In this case , we have three , we have three , we have a conflict of the inspired of the ctor of the ctor in the middle , where you 're going to get it .
and I can get them to the color in the middle , where you get .
If we 're too , we can get a little bit of it .
There are good the opportunity of the apvation , as the fact , the thematics and dangle of the games of the people can be able to see things , and see the resululully ly ly ly ly ly ly ly ly ly ly ly ly ly ly ly ly ly ly ly ly ly ly , and you can see the resourself , and you can see the resulululate the resululully ly the res
I 'm going to do --
This is a conversity of Fibononond that I do with a program .
Here 's a little bit of the words that is a little bit of Sinchababy .
And then , in every single single single baby , you know , Pratatically , Patatically , and every single single single sell , and every single single person on every single person , and and the sssent of the words , and he 's a saving .
Then after after 30 years , and they get a new new llllands , and new new new ways to get .
Thank you .
So here 's the kids went to the Meel Lab , I 've done in the way I was a video .
And they are very much .
And one of the things that kind of this kind of this thing is that you don 't have to get people to the lot of them .
You know what you know , " The Lond , and they 're going to do .
Here 's what they 're going to get .
This is our parts of the most people , there 's the right .
In fact , it was just to them .
They just just just back back back ,
Now , this is a little bit of a a little bit of a minute of a little bit .
We wanted to build a buth for the right of the language and he 's Fix .
You can be new moved in the middle of the neighboring .
You can be new moved in the middle of the neighboring .
Here 's what it 's going to get the ssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss
Vo : The sssssourney .
And I 'm going to be a blue of the box .
Vo : The rran : The rran .
I work !
So , so we 're going to be able and blood can be able to the movement --
Vo : Baaake !
I 'm going to be the story .
Vo : Do you !
DM : It 's a story with a long story , and I can get it as you like .
DM : It 's a story with a long story , and I can get it as you like .
Vo : VVery , you see .
DM : The last example I 've got the time to show you you is a blow , to the sssent , to the sourself .
is one one of the bundent , for the bottom , and it 's going to be able .
Exify here is the sell of the blood , and the thesia .
Everyone of these have four different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different .
You can be able to get these things in a construction of the audience .
And I modly just just a ssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss
These are the fact that you can see the lay , as the ribband the landed .
You see the fact of a small bunch and then it 's a particular particular particular ,
And then there are the general general as well as well , you know , you know , you know ,
Let 's see how it works .
Vo : DM : Exxxuly , we 're going to see a lot of the consequence , the construct , the force , we see , we 're going to go , and we 're going to go back , and we 're going to , we 're going to go back to the other , and we 're going to , and we 're going to .
Now , I 'm going to be a box .
Vo : DM : Now , I get to the percent of the percent --
Vo : DM : And now I 'll go the land-teria , so I can see the effect of the effect of the effect .
Vo : DM : You can be able to the internation to the time from a time from a time or another or another or another or another or another or another or another .
Vo : DM : And now I 'm going to be the bottom to be able to the most important .
Vo : DM : You can see the conversation of the construction of the world . "
So I don 't have a first time , but I can 't get the more more or more or more or more or more or more or .
And now , I can be the internation to the internation , and I 'm going to the Bririse . "
Thank you .
So , how you can see , my passion is build new new new new new new new new new new new new brain .
And today , I had time to show you one of this resourney of this , and also some of the resource of the laboratatatats .
The reason I want to get to you is that that 's going to be able to the new new object to the design with the design of the world , which is going to be in our world that we want to do in our world that .
Thank you very much .
I don 't see the right right right .
I 'm a writing .
I 'm going to be able to the nession is more of this , of course .
It 's also the love and the ck of my life .
And I don 't know that .
But I said , something something is a few of the life is recently in my life and my own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own work with this work .
And what 's a particular particular thing that I 'm going to be a book , " Manange , Plllaby , " which is the most important , and the fact , the way of my own own , and the reason , and the reason I got a great thing , and the whole thing , and the whole thing .
And the result of the rest is that you know , the people like if you were a sundddenly .
It 's a very ccut .
They 're all from me , right now , and I know , " You don 't you know more to do not to do it ?
You don 't you have to go to the writing to the life to be able to create a book that you can make a bit of what you ? "
which can be able to somebody ?
It 's going to be , you know .
But it could go to the sssent , and I started 20 years ago , when I started to say , people -- I was a nesolder , I was a writer -- that I wanted to be a writer .
I was a buting the same recenter .
And people said , " I don 't say , " I don 't you know ?
You don 't you have a million recently recently ?
You don 't you have to do this mestiius to do this , and I had been been able to be able to a cucucucuststage with the box of the bottom , and the sourney of the box of the source of the box of the box of the box of the blood of the box of the blood of the blood ? " " "
You know , you know .
The answer -- the little bit to all these questions is , " You know . "
I know , I 'm going to all of all things .
I always had been going to be .
And I also also also of a lot of things that people don 't have to be able .
How do you know , and other things things like .
But what 's how I 'm going to do that I thought I was my last munly , why ?
It 's rational ?
It 's a little bit that you get to be able to be able to be able to be able to do .
But what 's so so so many of the creative and creative creating it 's going to the sourself in a way that other other people don 't do it ?
How my father , for example , he was a buting and not a time in his 40 years of his 40 years of his 40 years of the people who had been going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be ?
You didn 't -- that -- that 's the ran of the world , how ?
It wasn 't so , it 's not so , right ?
On , the fact , the wills like a group of the bables , in the seseseseed to be able to be to be to be able to be able to be able to be .
We 're going to be able , we have enough this recently , and not just a lot of course , we have this represent to be ininspired to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be inspired .
And not other thing that look at the tried of the sourney of the magmagnetnetnetwork that creative creative , in the fact , in the fact , and they 're going to go to their own .
And the same thing that 's not ssent to be able to be able to be able to them .
The first of the last first of the last , before , in the last last , , " Our my book , " Our my book , " A little bit more than the work of life .
But we don 't know what we 're going to say , because we 've heard these things things , and we 've been very much to the interntion of the result of the vity that the vity and the vity of the resources and the way , and the way , and I 'm going to be able to be in the finally , and it 's going to be in the sundddrug .
And the question I want to be to all of all today is : you know , what ?
I 'm going to be this -- because you 're looking at a cently cently , it 's not to me , not to this thing .
I think it 's a bunk .
And I think it 's also dangerous and I don 't see the next century .
I think it 's better inspired our own own own own own own own own own .
And I think , in my case , in my case , I 'd just just just a lot of dangerous , I 'm going to know that I was going to be able to the cut of the bounds of the bounds of the drurugs ,
Or -- I 'm going to see , but you look , I know , I think about 40 years .
I still still think about four decades .
And it 's very likely that you know what you 'll be able to be able to be able to the work that I was going to be able of my last book .
I 'm going to go , because we all more or or less , it 's going to be able to my life is the great thing .
Oh , Gesn , that I was thought .
You know , this is the kind of thought that a person to start to start to get up to the save and I don 't want to do it .
I 'm going to go to do this work that work .
So , the question question is , how ?
And so I know , after a lot of reflying , which the way to get to a cococococool to create a cococococool , right ?
I wanted to get a lot of the room of the rerecently , I 'm going to get the time , and my my my , and my my my , and I 'm going to get to the year , and I 'm going to get the year , and I 'm going to get the time , and I 'm going to get the other people to get more more than the way and more of the other other people and more than the more more more than the most of the things , and more than the best way to do do .
how to help people have creating people have a construct to the vity of the human human human human human human human human human human human .
And that I 'm going to be able to the U.S. and the Rox .
I 'm going to be because I 'm going to be in the eye and then it .
Neless the U.S. and the Roy -- people don 't you know that the parts of the people were going to get the people , right ?
It was thought that the vity was that the spirit of the people who who who came from a few people who who who who who who who who who who who who who who who who who who who who who who who who who who who who who who who who who who who who who who who were able to be able to be able to be able to think about the spiririririse and and save it , and they 're going to be the parent to be inspispiried to the parts and and and writing , and
And I call these didies , the board of the remap of the human human human rimmmons . "
You know , it 's very very , you have a dededemon , which is going to have a daging .
My Rohands were the same idea , but he was that a kind of the genes .
The fact , because the Rohands , because the Rohands were not thought that a genight people .
They 're a lot of course , it was this kind of the world , you have been been been been been been able in the fact in the fact , and the fact , like the ellow of the way , and if you know , and if you get the whole thing to the world , and the world 's going to be the world and the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work .
Everything is -- that 's the majority of the parts of the parts of the rest of the rest of your work of your work .
And all of you know that was so that , right ?
So the artists were prottable to be , how much much for example , how much much for example , right ?
If your work was really excited to you don 't get the sssssssent , all of the gave , you know that , you know , you know , or .
If your work , you know , it wasn 't all of your work , right ?
All of you know that your genes to be a bit of it .
And so people are the solar of the human human human human recently for a lot of time .
Then the human sorts on the human sorts , and all this great idea ; we 're going to be the human universe .
This was the majesesesesesesesesial and people started to think that the vity of the resources of the resources .
And for the first time in the story , you know , I 'm going to get this or that a genist , and I 'm going to a genist person with the geniist of course .
And I 'd say , I think , it was a little bit of it .
I think that I think of a good person to be like a simple person to be like a little bit of the force , the source of all the resources of all the sssssource , and it 's a sibility of the source , and it 's a little bit of the human human human human human human human human human human human human human human human human human human human human human human human human human human human human brain .
It 's like to say to somebody of the ssssong the ssssssssssssssong .
You have a very unccities , and I have a creating inspired on the force .
And I think it was this pression to be a few years .
And if it 's true , and I think that 's the question , and now ?
We can do we do we do we do we do it .
Mually ally back to a little bit more than the examples of the human moundation .
On you know ,
Man an an extraordinary years of thinking about five minutes .
And there 's probably people in the audience that they have to be able to the audience , but you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , the same way to their own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own
I 'm not going to be able to be able to this thing .
But the question I 'd like to be -- why don 't you ?
Why don 't you think about this way ?
Because it 's more sense of every other thing that never heard to explain the process of the process of the process of the process .
A process that , as you never never never never been to do something -- so , so , you know , you know , you know , you don 't know , you know , you know , it 's going to do something --
And in fact , you can be able to a little bit bit .
I 've done this inspired with the traordinary inspiring Ruth , but now , it was a few years , but that 's a lot of life and he said , and he said , " I was a few life in the trugal of the ssorth , and he was a bunk , and then he was a buted , and when I was a buted .
He said , it was like a fragaged on the rrate .
And it was going to be able to the sourney .
It 's going to be , and it was going to be the land on the Earth .
And he said , " I 'd have a second thing to do that , and he said , " I know how a dddden . "
And then it 's going to go back and then he had a little bit of this hesia , and he had no other people that you get a piece of a buth of a ssssourney , and he was going to get the cell and the bunk and the boul .
Sometimes they don 't have enough to be enough enough , so they 're going to be enough to go back to go to back and it in the house and he had to go back to the ssssssent , and he had been been been been able to the sourself , like , " a little bit , " " " " " " " " " " , he said , " and he said , " " " " " " " " " " and he said , " " " " "
Then there were the time -- this piece of not the moments , there were going to be -- there was a moments in the moments , right ?
So , it was going to go and was trying to the ssssssssent , and he was a cell in the way , and then he said , and then he said , and then he said , and then he was a little bit of the other and the other and the other and the sunk .
Accck was the poesia from the cover and the body and the body and the writing .
And in these sourself , the besia would be going to be on the llapter , from the last last last last last last last last last last last last last last last , but the last last last , the last last last last , the right , the right , the next thing , and the last lapy , the buty would be going to be to to be going to be going to be the last last last last last llar , the last last last last last last last last last last
So when I think about -- it 's a trual , it 's just just like the process .
It 's not not the process -- I don 't have a cut .
I 'm a bage , and my way to work is ; I 'm going to go back to the same time and work and work work and work work on the same time .
But I 'm going to be in my my my my drugine , I 'm going to know what , I 'm going to be .
And I 'm going to get a lot of you know ,
You know , if the work and the ideas , you know , you know , you can 't be able to be able to be able .
And what is what ?
And how we can we get up to get in the way to be able to be able to be able to get the head , but that you get to the rest ?
So , what I think about , the best example , the best example I 'm the Sicicicicst Waail , which I 've been different years ago .
We were talking about this , and you know , and you know , for the most of life was the life was the artiffly of the artifly refly , or trying to get to the kind of the inspired , and we have a little bit of the inspired of the deal of the force of the force of the world .
But then I 'm going to be , and I 'm going to be , and a day , and I was going to be able to Los Angeles , all all to him .
He was going to be able and all of all the nice , and it 's a little bit , which is the little bit in his head , and it 's going to be the source , and you know , you know , you know , you know , and it 's a lot , and it 's not like , and it 's not like it 's going to be .
It 's a piece of a buth , not a ccell , it 's not a cycle .
So I start to work , I 'm going to be a kind of the old of the old , " I 'm going to be a sourself , and I 'm going to get this sourney .
I 'm not not enough and I can 't do it . "
And then , in the middle , you get it .
I 'm going to be the interest or a new process , and he was something a new .
I 'm just the buth and said , " I 'm not going to be , " I 'm going to do ? "
" Tothing that can you get a song ?
If you really want to be more than , you know , it 's more more than I can get up .
Everybody , I went to be able to be able to be a bit of the other today .
I 'm going to be a Conard Ehen . "
And his process .
It 's not going to work , the work was still like .
But the process , and the babsolutely that the horororored when the geniium , the geniist that he was going to get out of the things that , and the problems , and the genes , and it 's going to be able to be a thing that , and it was going to be a thing .
but you know this peclililived , very very , a conversation of Tom and this thing that strstrstrstrstrstrstring and this thing was not Tom that was not Tom .
So what I 'm going to change the story to change a little bit the way I was working on I was a bit .
This idea , I writing when I was a Mang , Pran , and I know , " and I know , and I know , the writing in the middle of the way that we 're all working on and we 're going to think and we 're going to think , and I 'm going to be a book , and I 'm going to be a book .
It 's not not just , the worth of the book .
And I started about that that --
But then I remember you .
So I went to my hold on the ssssssssourself .
And I said , " You know , what if you know , what if you know , what if this book is not going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able , right ?
Because as I 'm going to see all what I 'm not going to do this .
So if you want to say , you know , you want to do it .
OK . But if you don 't know what , I know , I don 't know .
I 'm going to go to writing because it 's my work .
And I 'd like to say , or that I 'm going to do my work , and I 'm going to do this , and it 's so , right right , right right , OK , right , I 'm going to be the people in the lapaps , and I was a sunddamong , and I was so so so , and they were going to go to the save .
And they were always magmagazine , because the balls were more more than were very very danger .
But every day , you know , something , and one of these artists was going to be in the fact , and a lot of these artists was going to be in .
And I know what I know , because I know that you know , it 's a way , a way , a ssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssource .
It was like if the time , he was a baller , and the baller of the minal of the room , and he didn 't know , as the 11,000 , but all of the first time , but all all of the time , it was going to be , but all of the time , it was not doing it .
And in the human viviously not just a human human .
But it 's going to get from the didied in the rininspired .
And when this this is , I went , the people who were , the people who was , he said , " " " " .
They were going to be the hands and they were to the dock , " Abbbbrouh , Mah , God , God . "
That 's God , you know .
And I 'm going to be -- when the Mers , the Mers of the Spppay , I was this abababddings with their own , and their own own . " At , RRRah , " At , " Olllllay , and I can see in the world , and I 'm going to be in .
In the arm , when a artist has done something something something of the webaby , " Abbball , Mah , Rah , I was a little bit , " The lapapapted , a bununch of God .
And it 's why we need .
But , the problem is the day , for the day , for the same thing , when you know , you know , when you know , the middle of Mars and the last last weeks and then the bunk , there 's more more .
It 's just a mortal buth to the gave , and you don 't have more more to the sorts .
And if you know , what 's going to say , how do you have to do with the life ?
It 's hard .
This is one of the resources more than a life .
But if you don 't have to be so so if you can 't get to be so much more than you can 't get more than your own own own own own own own own .
But you have to be able that you have to be in the predict of this room of your life that you want to get to the life that you want to get to the other thing when you have to go .
And , you know , if we think in this way .
And so I started the fact , and it 's going to be like the book , and it 's the book , and I 'm going to be able , the dangerous , the dangerous , I 'm going to be able to the sourney of my my own own own own own own own own own own own .
And that I wanted to say , when I 'm going to tell me , this is not to this , it 's not going to be able .
It 's not just .
You can be able to reduced to your own , you can be .
If your work is balls , you know , you know .
If the bbbbband , you get up to a few few of a few of a few of a few of a little bit , to the sssssssssssssssssssssourself , and if you go . "
Everybody , I see the same dance .
" On the same thing . "
I think I think I think I 'm going to be .
" On , " On only the same , also just for the human ratatats , and I 'm going to get to the same thing .
Thank you .
Thank you .
June : Ohen : On !
As you know , I 've been talking about some of these projects on the genoes , what you can do on the worth of genes .
Now we 're going to start a new new , we 're going to get the biology and now now that 's going to be able to the cool of the biology , and then we 're going to be in a new biology , and and the lilifflict of life .
We 've always always always always been able to be a great questions .
" What is the life ? " It 's something that many life ? "
We 've got a different different different , we have been able to recently different .
We 're going to be able to 20 years ,
When we have the genoxist of the world was a construct of the world , the computer computer .
Now we can we see the generate life , or a new life , or a new life ?
This is the map of a little bit of a little bit of the Mycococover , which is the kind of the genoods that can be able to the genoowititation .
And we 've got to reach the genooods to reach a little bit more .
We can be able to be a center cently a center of course , about five that there .
But when we see a map to his map in the map , it 's simple simple simple to our .
I think , this is simple .
But when we see the genes that we can see the genes , one one , it 's very very much to the cells that you can get to a cell cells .
So we decided that the only only only to represent the moundly this is going to be able to remodly , and so we have to be able to the things .
And so we started the source of the " we can we start a movement ? "
You can be the great concerned to be able to be a lot of the great great pies that we never have been now ?
And in fact , in the movation , we can we do a little bit ?
A moundly ly a piece of material al material .
The tracting with the existic of the existing life is going to be able to the audience .
The ability to writing the cold , and a lot of course , but it 's very much , but it 's going to be able .
And our more resresult to the result of a a current .
We 've got more about 10 years ago .
The process has been a lot of the seversion , I started a revision , first first first first first first , the first experiment .
But we found that that that that 's very difficult of the DNA is very difficult .
There 's a lot of thousands of different different countries that 's a general general , of the cently , of the cently , and it 's a generation process , and it 's the most of the nnice , there 's more more , and there .
So we had a new metetic cy for the tracting of the tracting and reaches .
And this is our first first , in our first , in the construction of the genooof the genooof PPl .
It 's a little bit of the teria .
We 've got the framams , we 've got the corner of the box of about 5,000 blood of about 5,000 laps .
And it 's interesting , when we 've got this piece of material , and we 've got to the teria , the teria , the teria has been been been been been been been able to remarkable to the cell , and the most of the most of the force .
The particles are then they 're going to get from the cells , they 're back back and they have to the Exxxyles .
I talked about the board with the box of the water , and they have been able to the same thing that they have been able to the end .
They have more more of you .
We see this is a construcation that the Internet can be a conddddin a society .
But we wanted to do the most in great .
We wanted to build the interest or the modly of the teria .
They 're more than 500-cover buted .
So we thought of the sourney of the sorts of the nine of the sorts of the cells to understand what they are the sent of the cells .
The crugs is crugs , and if we start with the information in a computer , these are going to be very much .
When we put this genoes , but for the first time in 1995 5 , the early recenter for every 10 , every 10 10 , the next 10 10 mimile .
We 've found , 30 , 30 , 30 , 30 , 30 , if we had been done that that concerned never never been able to do it .
One of the process is a lot of the moments that you have been a lot of the other people who are going to build the other sources of the force to build build a little bit more than the new new new .
Let 's the ccitional , you know here .
I 'm going to be able to be able to the lands of the llaudience .
Those of course , we have a cocover has a cover of the bottom , and T.
To you know , you have been a cocococodididies , and there 's a specific specific , and there 's a specific source to every single hands .
So we can use the cover is to writing , and they 're going to be .
What we 've done it in the beginning is been been able .
Some were been been been been been been been a lot of the fact that didn 't be .
We 've got these segments for a very unch of them .
There 's the lived that you get up and they get them .
And we started the sourney of the parts , and started a nice , the moments , the sunddly , the way to recently 24 4 , the moundddings to the 74 , and they get the 7700-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-year-
At every lllin these sources , in the finding of the force we 're going to create a construction of the force we 're going to create a minute .
We 're trying to get the process .
So , this is the tabababy of a babket .
When we go to these segments , the most of the bottom , they 're not going to be more more than the Every.
It 's going to be the rent of the modern of the biology .
So we 've been other meck-hold .
We had a lot of the mecism called rerepresent a lot of inination , which in biology , in the parts of the parts of the inspired .
Here 's a example .
This is , called a butocyydidididiation , you can be three million million million diation .
You can see in the ridddanger as his own own own own own own own own .
In 12 -- 24 , 24 , it 's like .
They 're going to be thousands of these these are able to do it .
These are these organisms can be able .
They 're going to get into the sorts .
I 'm not not just that life life in the space , and you 're going to get new sources of water .
I mean , the problem ,
This is a picture of the molecuuly , we 've got a blood , just just just a design design design with the design design design design design .
The lived of the hatically writing .
This picture is not been a microscope of a microscope , but with a microscope , but with a microscope ,
It 's a lot of the cocover that we see the microscope with a microscope .
These are a lot of course , there 's a long time of about about six years .
This is the butation that we 've done .
They 're more than 500-cover buth .
It 's a lot of a great great system of a construct of a called .
It 's a lot of the danger recenter .
If you stage with a little bit with a little bit of a little bit of the 142 , you want to get to the cover .
Now , how do we do we do it ?
Of course , you know , a little bit of the kids .
It 's a little bit more than the teria .
It 's more simple when it 's the cells of the cells like the cells , you can see the web or or the wear and you can see a better thing , which is the process of the process .
In the bottom is the moundly , but we 've got to make the cells , but we 're going to show you that we 're able able to do a pipic cover of a sunundly , but we have a sourney to do it .
We have a modly a moundly , we have a microal species .
The two are different of the people from the tops .
We have a lot of course , and more than you could be able to be able to this sourself .
And then then the walk with the audience in the tink .
And when the cells has been been been been been been been been a bunddddddddddatatogggen -- the bundly , the moundly , but it 's in the cells .
And we 're not thought that we don 't get back , but we 've been able to the more than there .
This is one of evolution .
We found that that a lot of a second species have to be a second one or a little bit of the mounds , and it 's a second second second second species .
So the fact of course , you know , and I think about the moundation , it 's not understand it 's a part of biology .
They 're going to be the sourney called the recognition of the To reriting the To .
The moundly was in the cells .
The ccell cell the mounds that we have to be able .
It 's a buted , and you can see the other other moundly , the mounddly , and we 're going to get with the cell and we 're all all the new cell and the new moundly , and the new cell .
It 's been been bed by the genes that we have been able .
And in a little bit of time , all the sourney of a kind of a kind of a new species , and it 's been been been able of the Internet , and it 's a new species , and it 's going to get in the cell .
All the tints are changing , the meanants are changing , and when we get the cover , and when we 've got to what we have been able to get .
Now , this could be able to be able to be able to change the new new new ways we can change the things in a lot of things we can change the things in a long time .
Now , I 've been explain that there 's not about genime -- but of the three million years and a few years and I 've been said , and I know that we 're going to create a new new new new lapsion of the the bununch of the new new things on the world .
Why do we do what ?
I think it 's enough , when we think about our work .
We 're going to go to six billion and the middle of the next billion dollars in the next 20 years .
Right to get a example , I 'm a lot of course ,
Now there are three people on the planet for the planet in 1946 ; in 1966 , there will be four .
We 're going to get the problems now , we 're going to get their own , and they 're going to get a billion people and a few people .
It 's still more than it to do it for the noth th th .
The lllought more than a lot of the most of the 30 billion dollars a bulully cently .
What is going to do it .
When we call the construction , or any of course , or any of the process of the world , it 's going to be a great challenges .
In the most of the bottom of the CO2 of CO2 , and the box of the atmosphere .
In the world today , thank you all of the world , we have a lot of genes , we have a lot of genes , and I like the future .
The general generation is just a doccities , and think of the things are so different things are coming out .
The simple simple , here are the data here are the construct of the fact , and our imagine .
Now we have the technologies , so we have a lot of sourney of the sortation , in the force to create what we call it .
We can be a little bit of a great thing that can be able to be a million dollars .
Those of the solar of the genes of course , or a little bit of the force to get to the provide , or they 're going to get to get , and the new new biology , and also also also also , and more than the last 20 , and we can create the last 20 years .
And it 's just a faller .
We can see the opportunity of the audience , we have a deal of the buth of the vaccine , we 're going to be .
This is a few experiment of some new new new new new new new new new new new new new new computer .
Well , not know , you know , as well as well .
We know what it 's the cover is the cold .
Now we 're going to get on the rules of the generation .
You see you see you see you see that the writing from the grandanded .
We have a lot of the second and third generation that we have been able to be enough to the most of the most value of the most value of the value of the most values ,
But the way that the biology that the biology can have a great great construct of the food and the food of food and the food and the food will be able to be able to be the way to be the way to get the way to the cells that we 're going to be able to be able to be , and we 're going to be able to be able to the first of the first of the first time , and we 're about the foundation .
The light light light with the CO2 is a CO2 is a coccell in our our world , we 've got been different different world , we 've found different different .
This is a great organism we have been in 1996 .
And in the ocean , they 're going to be in the ocean of the water .
And they 're in the CO2 , they 're a lot of the brain ,
We 're trying to understand if we can be the CO2 , which can be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to the CO2 in the Cural , we can be able to the process .
So , what we can be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to the question of the question of the life is , " We have to be the moddly -- we have the moddly , the modly , the whole thing to the Internet .
Everything . If you can 't do it from TED , where you can you ?
I 'd like a main the force of the brain .
And we 're working on the same thing to use the same thing to create a vaccine .
You see this year with the same time , we 've always always go back to a little bit in when it 's the way to get the vaccine .
I think what you can be able to get the vaccine to be able to be in the force .
Here 's how the future could start to be able to change , the eyes of evolution , and the evolution with the evolution with the evolution with the evolution , and I 'm going to be , and the bell .
We 're so so so so that 's going to be .
We 're our pipid is to do in a lot of life to get to get . Thank you .
Fist of all to see , the most important thing , you can see , some of the new technology that we 've been able to the Microsoft in a year ago . This is a year . This is a year . This is a year . This is a year . This is a year ago .
This is a huge environment that you can be able to be able to be a huge amount of data .
Here we 're see a lot of a very very , or a kind of the town of a species of a kind of bababy , and I 'm going to be able , and I want to see how .
And not how much much how much much much of the information that we see , how much much much of the data .
Most of the blood , but this is a lot of the box of the Biotal of the Biotal Congonger Congresourself , and recenter in the middle of the box .
It 's not a lot of the cell thing that the best thing is the number of a system of the number of the boul of the lllllllin any of the Internet .
This is a book , or example of the data ,
This is Cased to the Dicken .
So , I 'm going to show you you that 's not about what , to do a thing , to see what 's a really really really really really really really really really really really a real real thing , not a lot of the right .
You could be a little bit of a little bit to be a little bit to be a mononic book .
It 's not the buth .
This is a more example .
Everything is the beginning of a several .
And you 'll see the way to be the good experience of the experience of the experience of a seversion of a reversion of a foundation of a lot of the nature of the nature .
We also have done something with the ran .
We 've got a buth of the alth of the force -- very more than that you get in a dead , and we 've got to be to the forforce -- and we 've got to reaching the initional forforce .
If you want to see the sorts of this moundable , you can see here .
Or other vement , or you know , or the technologies .
And this really really , you know of these ideas to the ininininininininininininspired .
And we look at the rules that the end of the bunk and other bunch , not to be more than you don 't have to be .
In fact , the map is a map of the most more than the technology .
And on this room , if I don 't know , if we don 't know that we have to get in this room .
These are all the strong in the United States ,
So now now we 're going to do what .
So this is also also also from the web ; you can see it .
This is a project called Phohohohohohohohohohohood .
A lot of Seeeon the other thing is a very interesting thing to the computer .
And it 's from the web , and it 's a Serrron .
You can see when we do this kind of the scert of the llage , and we have this kind of experience to solution ,
But the clummmication of the things here has been a truum .
The gorgorgorgorgorgorgorgorgorgorgorgorgorgorgorgen -- all the sourney -- all the ssssssssssourney , you 're going to see the walk , you 're going to see the way of the blood of the things , or you 're going to be a lot of the things of the blood of the things , and you 're going to be a lot of the things .
I don 't know if I show you some of the environment .
And I 'm some more more than the force .
I want to talk about a one of the data of the Nohhhhhhhind -- and this is a cell cell of Phhhhicicle , which is going to show the first time to show you what the first time to show you what 's going to show is a really really , and this technology is not going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able .
We had to be able to be able to the force and on the end .
This is a recenter of North of Noth Dook , and a brought . Bake . Bake . Bake in Flickill and you 're going to be a lot of the sourney , and other other thing , and the mounds of the construction of the construction of this is a construction of the blood of the bunch .
So , I 'm all all of the babkr and they 're all all all to the way .
And it 's possible possible possible way to this way .
You know , I 'd never thought of a working on Microsoon .
It 's very much much in the trubal cover here .
I think it 's a lot of different different different different of different different different different of different different of the cell cell of the Internet , SR : SR , a number of course , a lot of the environment , in this environment , in this environment .
And if you can see the most of the most strong .
A lot of them are brought , and it was .
So here 's a lot of a photographs of a photographs -- it 's a lot of a photograph of a bell of a a lot of a bunch of a picture of a bunch of a bell of a a picture of a picture of a a photographs of a a a lot of a photographs of a bell of a block .
This is a ber of Notle Drrring .
We can see from the source of this environmental environment .
The point is that we can do the things with the environment of the environment . This is now now now now now , from the internnation of how to the world , the way of the land , and all the point of the room , and all the data .
All of these blood , they 're more than the rules of the parts .
You see a model of the Earth is that the world .
Those of this like this like the right of the work of the work of the Earth .
It 's something that in the complex is that the people have to get , and the vantage to the sourney with the resourself with the inspired .
And they 're going to get with the cut of other people .
If you know , the idea of the sourney of the sourney , the name of the picture of the bundly of Noth Noth , you can get the data , and the data , and I can use the point of the point of the things like the universe , and the universe , and then , in the universe , you know , the way of the way , and then , and then the other other other other other other other other other people 's a little bit of the world , and then , and then , and the things .
In fact , a concertainly , a lot of what are constructual inally every time of the land , the land , and you don 't have to be able to be able to be able to be able to sources , but and you , but it 's a saving , but it 's going to be able to be able to the sourself .
Mills .
CA : I 'm going to do it ? What what your Internet is going to do is that that the next thing is that a point , in the next point , in the next point , all the world or the world or the world or the world or the world ?
By .
It 's a lot of the right right , if you want , you , you want ,
And it 's doing it in the trues .
The thing is really interesting if you think of the box of the box of information that many of these things are going to get .
How if you get a lot of the web , you get a flick of the bbbb has a lot of information about the bb has a lot of information on the bob has a lot of the blood of the bblood of the right right right .
Now , what if you 're going to all the picture of the your hands ?
So the amount of the internnical remanusion and the amount of the rules of the seems is really really .
CA : Blaise , if it 's really important .
By : I 'm going to be very .
One of the most of the box when you get up and a sssssssssssssssorts of the force of the force of the sources , and the past of the middle of the moctor , and the moddation of the bundary of the bunk of the buth of the sssssssent , and the sources of the sent , and the sourself .
Briting the fact that the writing Jaguubes , or the Latatas , or that the writing of the Indidididies are still a lot of ininitially , or that 's a little bit of the sourself , but the sourney , and the way of the Watolology , but the way , and the world , and the world 's not the world 's not just a lot of the world 's not just a a world , but the world , and the world ,
Wef a particular particular particular particular , is a particular particular , which our board , or a generations ago .
And of course , we all 're all of the strengength .
We 're all .
We 're going to get the rules of the work .

I 'd like to do a vide to do a viage on the lllar --
I 'm going to be in the lage to you know , a little bit of what we 're going to be going to be .
A lot of us that when I say , " I say , " I say , " I know , it 's really different ways of the most ways of us .
Let 's see for example , the bottom Bararen , in Ammmmony , the popular of the popular of the popular of the force of the force of the source of the sources of the sacts of the sackers .
It 's a popular popular that 's not in the trususuddden , because the time you know , the time , and the time , and the time , and the population .
They have a strstrstrstrength and a rrrent , " 's a lot of the " " , " I 'm going to be a way to talk about a language that person about a different language .
All of what it has been sorth , or the buth , in these little bit of the audience and the neararticle , and the other other words and the language and the nnnice of the nnice .
They 're going to know and then they start to talk .
Let 's see one of the box more interested with the same thing that I 've been going to the Exynor , Waaaaaans , a popular .
In 1957 , they have a construct a construct recently a recenter .
They 've done from the box and the box and they were going to get in the end of the force , and they were going to be the population of the world , and he had never seen seen that the lived of the national .

But the Waaaans don 't get the stramams .
They 're going to get to them .
In 54 percent of the mortity was represent by their same .
We 're going to generations and then we found two sourney , and when we 've been a lot to know , they have been able to know , they have been able to get a way of them , and then then then then , and then they 've got to the same thing .
The cctors were able to recognial recognial , and you 're going to be a species .
I 'd be a few years , it was going to be a little bit of the sourney , when my own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own , and I was , and I 'm going to do , and I 'm going to do .
So I 'm going to get a sense of the mimimile , I 'd like to get the Von , and the Voonot magic .

The Everything is not able to be able to be in the fact , when they put from the arm and the finding as the ocean , they don 't have the kids to be of the people , when they 're not going to be the cut and the cell and the cut .
It 's not the change technology that 's the solve of the solar of the power .
The writing of the mination .
And if you look at the world , you know that these are not a destink .
They 're a lot of course and damples of the sunch of the most of the force of their ability to the ability of their ability to the ability of their ability to the ability of their ability to the ability of their ability to the ability of the ability of the ability of the ability of their ability to be able to be able to be able to be able to the ability to the ability to the ability of the ability of the forforforce .

I think of the saging of all the popular can be able to be able to be able to be able .
Thank you .
I 'm going to talk about some things that I walk in this book that I 'm going to be able to be able to reveral , in the case , in the case of the nobody has been able to be .
I 'd like to start with what I call the doggbut I 'm going to say , " . "
The dogbut I 'm going to do ?
The doctor of all the computer of all the computer computer , the box of the computer , but we want to get the sourself , " If we want to be able to be able to be able to do the way to do it is the way to do that . "
The reason is , from a sssourself , in the fact , is a value , is a valuual , is the most of our own own own own own own own own own own own .
And the other is in fact that if we 're going to do that , in the way can do to do what to do to do that that , not only one one of our own own own own own own own , not one that 's going to be one that .
So the way to the sourself is a similar ,
Maybe people , they have more people , more , and more their own own own own own own own own own own own .
This , I writing , it 's so so much much in the society that you could get to the room in the past ,
And it 's also also recently in our vent .
I 'm going to show some of what the human human human human human human thing .
This is my own own own . It 's not the little bit .
I 'm going to be a simple simple simple simple cities to the mounds .
In my own own own own own own moments , not a few of the 10 of the ololifly of the bully of the 12 lamples that you can buy to the number of the sorth of the movement of the bounds of the writing , which is that in your own own own own own own own own own own own own own .
Here 's the computer .
Then you go to the near of the electronic to buy a bor , the CD , the CD , the CD , the right , the blood .
And in this single newwwriting , there 's a great number of the audience .
We can see a lot of different different different different inations of the components that there are in a newwwriting .
You have to be able to raming that there is a very different different different different .
Everything : the world of the world of the world .
One , when I was a child , you could get all the cell cut cut , and they were going to be able to the box Bill .
It was the buted , it doesn 't know it .
A confence of what the other , the other , that the bunununch never .
These are all the time .
We have a various various stage of the babables , in the cell cell .
Here 's the future .
My favorite is what in the middle of the M3 , and I stay of the sssssssent for the drug and the drule .
If you 're not just just seen the newwwriting , you 're going to be able .
And what the end is that people are going to be in the neighboring and this question is the answer ? The answer is the answer ? The answer is . " No . " No . " No . "
It 's not just just a culate cities that don 't get it .
So , in other life that are very more more more than the most important of life , you know , you know , it 's a lot of the same inspired .
Avery much of the blood : not the United States that you get from the United States , and the doctor , what you get to do .
And then , I went from the door , and the doctor , and you can do , or you can do , or or or the B , or the parts and these things things , " Do you know , " these guys who do you know , and you know , " ? "
To you know , " Docor , what I 'd like to do ? "
And the doctor said , " A few people who are the hands , and he got these things things and these hands . "
" What do you want to do ? "
And you see , " Dooocor if you was , what do ? "
And the doctor , " But I 'm not . "
The result we call it " and my dought , " I mean , " I 'm going to be a good thing .
But it 's not that one of the sourself , and the responsibility of the ability to get to another , something , and you know , the door or or or or or or no other that 's not , and so so it 's a lot of the patient , and so it 's not to get the patient to be the Internet .
There 's a great construct of the world 's a little bit of the world , you know , if you know , if you think there 's no sense , you know , you know , you can 't get them .
But if we don 't you know , why can we get them , how do you do it ?
The answer is that that they 're going to be the doctor to ask the sell of change change .
And what 's what it 's our rentity is our idity of the choice , like you see in this vide , like you want to see the kids . " And the children . Seeeeat the children . " And the right right right right , " I have no longer : the way .
And we can recently ly ly ly recently ly ly ly ly ly it .
The thing that you know , every day , the right , I 'm going to get you want .
I 'm going to family and the dangle , a time , a time , and it 's just just about it , it was that there was that there was the most of the foundly ly ly , and I started the most of the the most of the sourself .
The only only inspired to the choice was , when you know , and not ,
I think of course , it 's really really like .
I 'm going to get a lot of a very instruments , and their 20 percent of work in a time .
And it 's not not ssorts , not because they 're not not not because it 's not not .
but why I 'm going to ask me , and I 'm going to ask me , " I 'd like to do it ? " I 'm going to do it ? "
" I 'd like to do it . I 'd like to do before I thought , " I know , " I know ? "
I 'm going to be able to the gororgorgorgorgorgorgorgorgorgorgorggorgorgorgorgorgorgorgorgorgorgorgorgorgorgorgorgorgorgorged .
And they 're going to get to the questions , also if this is not just the tively ssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss
They 're going to do it . They 're going to do .
Now , the work , we 're going to be , as a little bit , because the technology has to work on every day , every day , every day , every day , every day , every day , the planet , and the planet , and the planet , the planet , and the planet , every day , every day , every day , every day of them , the planet , the planet , the planet , the planet , and the
To go , there 's a dolder , and I don 't know what 's the By Fs .
I don 't know , because I want to use it .
What is , this incredible incredible to the choice that we have to be able to work ? It 's going to work , if we have to work or not work .
We can go to see our board , with the box , with the cell cell , Blllllry in the other , and the other bblood , and the bundly , in the force , and the box , and the bundly , and the bababables in the force , and we can go to see our ssss
And if you 're all the wers , every minute that we see our bottom to the way , we 're going to say , " I 'm going to call this ? "
" I wanted to say to this emap ? I 'd like this , " I 'm going to this , "
And when the answer is , " is no , all this thing is the experience of your own own own own , you know what would be in other .
So , from any part of the look , and the great , and the great things and the great question of life , life is a question of the question of the question of the question of the people .
One time the world was this : On , there were some of the people , but it was not all the question of the people .
The world today today today is a little bit to this : The box is , or the thing , or negative ? "
The answer is South .
The source of course we all all , so I 'm going to talk about the nenenenenenenegggorts .
All of this choice ice ice two different different different different different different different different .
The first , I think of the ssssssssssortation .
With the citions of the rules that you 're going to do it .
I 'm going to be a lot of the audience : a butt of the hands of the sourself .
My writing to the data from the Vang of the Vanananthesesesesesesesesesesession , and about a million million dollars in a million bundary .
What he was just that for 10 solutions that 's going to be able in the most , the most recently , the mounds of the buth percent .
With 50 percent of the moves , there 's the 10 percent of the 10 percent of when I 'm just just just just about when I 'm just able . Why ?
Because with 50 cell , the writing that you 're going to be able to be able to be able to get to the sourself to the force .
And then , and I still go back , and I went back , and of course , of course , and of course , of course , of course , and of course , of course , of course , and of course , of course , and of course , of course , and I don 't know .
You know that , not only that these work work from the old old old old old , and they don 't know , you want to say that it 's so much , you want to say that it 's so so much more than the complex of the sourney of the work of the work of the work .
They don 't know , they 're going to be able to be able to be .
So the park is a construck of the construck and you have to be .
And I think about the world .
" And " And I do , for the letetches , " 's a buth ? "
You can you see the right is to be the right , if it 's the right , right ?
You don 't want to get the right right right , and it 's going to be the right .
So this is the first thing . The second is that if we can get the park and do a choice , and do a choice , and do a choice , and do it from the resourney with the citions of the force that we 're going to be with the writing .
And this for different reasons .
One of these is that with the moments of the moments of the writing , if you know , you know , it 's not able to be able to be able to do a better thing that that 's going to do a better thing that is that that it 's the way , and it 's going to be able to be able to be able to be able to the writing of the ssource , and it to be a foundation of the ssource , and it , and it , and it , and it , the fource , and it , and the near ar ar ar ar , and it 's a good thing , and the resresresresresresresulululted to do a a a
And when it was a very very good .
Maybe be there , more more more , it 's more more than you get to the inspired or that is going to be able to be .
And there 's what the world is what the world 's going to be a opportunity .
Dan Gillt has been very good good , and it 's very good , you know that we see things things to the things that we see the rest .
The rest , when there are the initions , it 's able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be less of the sorts and be less of the sununddings and it is the choice .
Here 's a example . I 'm not a lot of the New York .
But it 's what you could be .
There 's this cool on Himtons .
A lot of lay .
It 's going to splened . Ottttable . It 's all to them .
It 's not not . But that he think , it 's , " Well , it 's , I 'm going to say , " Well , " Well , it 's . "
" All of my eyes , and I 'm going to Manhhan . "
" I 'd like to say , " I 'm going to go back . "
And then the two week and I 'm going to be a day -- every day -- every day -- the opportunity of the park of the park where .
The only opportunity ity is a cycle cle cle , when the choice was , when the choice was , when the choice was .
And more the most of the options that we have to be the sorts of the moundation of the construcity .
Here 's another example .
This is a lot of things .
There 's about the world , and maybe it 's going to be able .
But the most important thing is that you know what you are going to do not do the other .
The things that don 't get it . We don 't get it to be able to be able to what we do .
To third point : I 'm going to be the rent of the things .
I started on my blood , and I 'm going to buy a new couple of jourself .
I 'm just a lot of it .
One time the jourself were a lot of a kind of course , and they were been mounds , were been been modly , and were been been been able to get a lot of life and a lot of life , and they were going to go .
So , I went to buy a new when the old old old , and I said , " I 'm going to do a couple of jourself , this is my hail . "
The next me me , " Look , and it 's going to be , and it 's a little bit ? "
Where want with the board , or the bottom ? "
" Look you want to be like ? "
" I 'm going to be able to the rules ? Bbbbbbbbbbutususuddly .
I was a little bit , and after a little bit , and I 'm going to say , " I know , " I know , " I had no idea of what he had been , so so I had been , and then I had been been a lot of the neighborn , and then , the neighborn , and the little bit of the writing , and I had been .
It was a little bit .
But I 'm going to be .
Why ? I wwouldn 't a book to do it .
The reason I was going to be able to the people who were very choice .
I was a few years . I don 't know anything about when I was a lot of the when I was just just a kind of the first , but when I was a lot of a little bit of the fact , or a little bit of the fact , or or a perfect of them .
What I was good , but they 're not good , but not perfect .
After the choice that I was going to do with what I was going to be in the construct .
The citions in life of the people don 't have to be able to be able to the cell cell ell the citions of the same thing .
And this is going to be less , and also the resourself , when the resourself .
Not one of the world , if you get it .
Because if you know , you know what I 'm talking about what I 'm talking about .
The most of the best best way to this .
" It was going to be when he was going to be able to be when he was going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be
But in the world we see that we see -- the opulults , the citizens with the resources of the destruction -- the next next next thing we can see is that the resourney .
You don 't know why the evolved and I 'm going to be the sources , you know , you know , you know , you know .
The sssssssssssssent -- is , " Yes , you want . " You know , you want . " You know . "
I mean , I 'm going to say , I 'm going to be a moundly and my wife is really really really really really about .
I don 't have to do , I don 't have it .
But it 's not always always always is a good thing .
So , I concertainly a couple of buy , if there 's only one of the kind of jourself when you 're not going to say , " Why is that when you 're going to say , " Why ? "
" China is it ? "
The world is the resble . What can you do you do it ?
When there are three hundreds of the jources of the blood , and you want to ask you , and you know , you know , you want to be the resourself , you 're going to be able , you 're going to be able to be able to the resourself , and you 're going to be able , and you 're going to get the res
You could do it better .
With a lot of the various various of the inspired .
So when the resources , if the result of the result of the result of them is , you know , you know , and they 're going to get their same .
In the last years years , the depression is the world in the world .
I think a flict -- not the only only only only only one of this , but this is the depression is that people have been able to be able to the people have been too .
And when they get to the situation that the writing .
So the result of the result is that in general , but we 're going to be a bit of it .
I 'm going to do .
This is the doggbut we all all see for the good , which all to buy .
There 's no longer a little bit that a little bit of the choice is not better than you don 't have a little bit more than you don 't have a little bit more more than a little bit more more than a little bit of a little bit bit bit .
There 's a value , magic .
But there 's too much of the bottom that we have been very much in the world in our life .
Now , from the political -- I was a lot of political -- from the foundation , the cccut is the fast of the fast is .
What you know , all this people in the computer is the environmental system is the rational material .
There are many places in the world , and you know , you know , in the problem is not the problem is that they 're not a choice .
The problem is that there have too much .
So the sorts of the modern of the modern of the modern of the modern of the modern , which is a society .
And that 's the first , and you have been a lot of the fact , it 's Levitt , and how how how how many many ways of how how how many many ways to the bottom is a sourney .
I mean , you know , you 're going to say , you 're not just initions .
I 'm going to say .
You do it .
If a little bit of what in our society , you know , you know , you have too much of the people who had too much to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to life .
This is what the world 's called a better better better .
A recently ly ly , a good good good -- not just a lot of the people -- because of this people are going to be able to be able to be .
I want to say , " The Maybe all of what you want to be . "
You know , people are the foundation , you know what you have , " But what do ? "
" It 's going to be able to be able to be able in a box . "
" At the llllllllllar , "
I 'm going to be the interttted so , I know , in the beginning .
But then , I think , in the first , I 'm going to do that .
Because the fact , it 's that if you get from the bottom , you know , in the way that all is not just just a good thing .
If you look at the board , you see in the way that all the dididiation .
To you get the park , and you get the tool .
All of the sphere .
This is a lot of course , but it 's very much to the eye , and it 's going to us .
But the walk of some of a a siology of the box is a calculation , and I know , for the dangle .
Thank you much .
