I showed these slides to show these slides to show that the glacial calotter , which for almost three million years , had the size of the 48 continental size of the United States , it 's reartical , that was reartical of 40 percent .
But this subvalues the problem , because it doesn 't show the spent of the ice .
The artical calotter is in a way , the clear heart of the global climate system .
It 's expanded by the summer .
The next slide will be a rapid carreled on the advanced for the last 25 years .
Space , they have a red in red .
You see , they expand to the blue wall .
That 's the ice in the winter , which is retreated by summer .
You can see that the so-like ice , of five years or more , is like blood , which is like blood , which is like the blood .
In 25 years , it 's been like that .
This is a problem because the heating interest stairline around the ocean where there are huge amount of coal where there are huge amounts of coal , which is , and they transformed into the microbes .
I think about the totality of the pollution of global warming , that amount could be doubled , super-standard , overcome this point of not return .
In some little deep laghi , Alaska meter is already rebolling from water .
The professor of Alaska University of Alaska was a team of a fast lachief that was a very low lake last winter .
Video : Wow ! At Gore : Wow ! The question is good .
A reason is that this termal exchange Groenland from the northermorth .
This is a river river that 's a river record .
The layer had never reached to similar .
This is the Kangerlussuaq , in the southwest of the Groenland .
If you want to know how the sea level of the sea for the shelter of the sea level of the sea .
These currents are increasing rapidly .
Another part of the planet : Antarctica , the biggest block of the planet .
The last month scientists have dichieve that the ice of ice is in the negative , and the Western Antarctica , which is particularly quickly , it 's particularly quickly , it 's particularly quickly in the shelter leaves .
Equietly , six feet of the water , like in Groenland .
Sulla Himalayas , the third largest block of ice , you see new laghi , which few years ago were glaciers .
40 percent of the world population 's population to get half of the water from that melt .
Sulle Ande : this glacier is the source of this city .
The landed is increased .
But when you decrease , the same happens to the water .
In California , the newspaper in the Sierra Nevada is deminured .
The idrics are in crisis .
The predictions , as you read , they 're grateful .
The growing securious growing in the world leads to an incendes .
The environmental disasters are increasing a rhythm out of the normal and without precedented .
Four times more numerous in the last 30 years of the precedented .
This is a whole unsustainable .
If you look at it in the context of the historical consequences .
In the last five years , we 've added 70 million tons of CO2 every 24 hours -- 25 million tons in the ocean every day .
Look at the East Pacific area , the Americans , to the west , and to both parts of the continent parts of Indian substacy , where there 's a radical impoverty in the ocean .
The major causes of global warming , together to deforestation , which is 20 percent of them , is the use of fossil fuel .
oil is a problem , and carbon is even worse .
The United States is one of the two more emissions , together to China .
And it was proposing to build a lot of other central coal .
But we 're seeing a direction of a direction .
These are the annoult projects in the last few years and some of alternative projects .
And at any way , there 's a political fight in our country .
The carbon industry and oil have spent 250 million dollars in the last year to promote carbon , which is a oxide , which is a oxide .
And that picture reminded me of something --
So , I live Natale , in Tennessee , where I live , there was a 3.8 billion gallons of carbon span .
Perhaps you have seen it on news .
This is the second bigger flow of these last flow in America .
It happened around Natale .
The advertising of one of the carbon industry was this .
Video : I 'm going to do it , you know , coal is a kind of allegro and happy .
It 's abundant here in America , and it grow our economy .
Frosty carbon is increasingly cleaned .
It 's good price , adorable and workers keep it .
Al Gore : At here is a lot of the West Virginia .
The biggest mineral mineral society is Massey Coal . This is his administrator .
Video : Don Blankenship : I 'll be clear -- Al Gore , Nancy Pelous , Harry Regigiving -- they don 't know what they 're talking about .
Al Gore : So the Alleance for the Clima has launched two campaign .
This is a part of them .
Video : Acore : Acore : Actually ALergy , we see climate change as a sery to our business .
So , this priority is to invest a lot of money in a large amount of money in a bunch of public and confused and confused the truth of carbon .
In fact , carbon isn 't spored .
We think it 's clean -- it 's also a good profum .
So , not predict of climate change .
Let 's go to us .
Video : Actor : Carbone -- you 've heard a lot of them .
So let 's take a turn into a structure to the avaning to the walk up to the smoke .
Strained ! The machines are a little noisy , but this is the sound of the clean technology of the clean carbon technology .
The carbon consumption is between the major warming , but the remarkable technology that you see changes everything .
Date a look : this is the hot coal technology .
Al Gore : Inally , the positive alternative alternational security .
Video : The America is in crisis ; the economy , the national security crisis .
The file that connects all : our dependence by fossil fuel , like coal and oil .
Now , there 's a new audace , audace solution to use circuit .
ReAmerica : 100 percent of clean energy in 10 years .
A plan to put America to work to work , make us sure more , and help us to stop the global warming .
Finally , a solution that is to solve our problems .
ReAmerica . You know more .
Al Gore : This is the last .
Video : It 's about to report energy to America .
One of the fastest ways to bring the dependence of the combustible that they kill our planet .
Compars : The future is here . I feel , a new energy network .
Compars number two : Novi investments for jobs for jobs .
Comment : Repower America . It 's time to be realists .
Al Gore : A old African proverbio says , " If you want to go fast , you go to yourself .
If you want to go away , you go together . "
We have to go away , fast .
Thank you very much .
LHC , I just introduced a LHC .
And promies to come back to how the car works .
So there I did . And for the other time , the LHC was the biggest scientific experiment ever there was the biggest scientific experiment ever tried -- 27 kilometers of circles .
His task is to reduce the conditions that were at least of a billion to the universe -- to 600 million times a second .
This is just ambicious .
This is the car belt under the Ginevra .
We photographing these min-Big Bang in the relevening .
This is what he 's working on . It 's called ATLAS -- is 44 meters and has a 22 foot diameter diameter .
This is a spectacular picture of ATLAS , you can see proportions .
Ten , we have accesus of last year , we have accesus the first car for the first time .
And this picture was taken by ATLALS .
It was because of immense festeggiving in control room .
It 's a picture of the first fashion that he had done all the turn of LHC , entering in collision , by one of the LHC , and spspread particles into the relevenator .
In other words , when we see that picture 10 writing , we knew that the car worked , we knew that the car was a great witty .
I don 't know if it was this to do us more or this , when someone went to Google and saw that the initial page was this .
That means we have a cultural impacts beyond scientific .
About a week later , there was a problem with the car , just had to these slaughters here -- these sleeping sleep .
These files are going to bring 13,000 pound when the car works at the maximum works .
Now , the technical technical between you will look at the sons and say , " It 's not true . They are files too . "
And they can do it because when they 're very co-called superconviction ,
So , at least 271 degrees , at least a temperature in the space between stars , these are going to bring that current .
In one of the junture of the magnetic magnetic in LHC , there was a defect of a factory of factory .
So the files surrounding , and the 13,000 points suddenly met a electric resistance .
This was the result .
Now , this is more impressive if you think these magnetes more than 20 tons , and they moved about 30 inches .
They have damage about 50 magnets .
We had to take them , what we did .
We have restinated them and enjoyed .
They 're now coming back to them all the subland .
By the end of march the LHC will be back to the integral .
We 're going to access it , and we 're going to get the data and I 'm just just laughing , and we 're going to keep this so our adventure to discover what are the universe is .
Now , of course , these indeed , these crashes are accending the debate on the value of science and engineering in front . It 's easy to constantly future to conversation .
I think the fact that it 's so hard , the fact that I think is the value of things like LHC .
I 'd like to end with the words of a English scientist , Humphrey Davy , which , I guess , I think , in defense of the inuseful experiments of his pupillo , his pupillo was , and he said , " Nist is so dangerous to the progress that the human mind of science is defined , that there are not mysteries have been a stereration , that our triumphonfers , and that we don 't have any new monds that we 're not conqueen . "
Thank you .
I want to start asking you to rethink of when , as children , play with the morning .
As you know how to get them to and get them , take them and get them , you know , you know , you know , actually , you know , how to think and solve problems with space .
The space reasoning is deeply connected to the way we understand a lot of the world around us .
So , from information usulity of our interaction with physical objects , with my Peaper , and my collaborator Jeevan Kalanithi , I started asking , " And if , when we use a computer , I started asking , " And if we use a computer , instead of having the only cursor of the mouse as a digital policy that moves on a desktop , we could deal with both their hands ,
and how do it to our please ?
The question was so interesting we decided we decided to explore the answer , building the answer , building the Siftable .
In a few words , a Siftable is a big interactive computer as a cooking bidden .
In a few words , a Siftable is a big interactive computer as a cooking bidden .
You can move them with them , they can , " see " between them , feel their movement and they have a screen and a screen and a wireless .
But most of course , they 're physicists , like the morning , as the morning , can just be a grandchildren .
The Siftable is the example of a new ecosystem of tools to manipulate digital information .
And as they become more physicists , conscious , conscious of the motion , of others , and as they become more physicists , conscious , of how we die , we can explore new explore and fun and fun and interaction of interaction .
I 'll start with some simple example .
This Siftable is configured to show of video : if you in a direction , the video will rotate this , if you go back to .
These interactive rits are conscious of others .
If I love them , they 're interested in what they 're around .
If they 're surrounded , they can see it and act a little bit .
If they 're surrounded , they can see it and act a little bit .
They also have their movement and inclination .
We then realized that one of the interesting implications of the interaction was that we can use common managed data , for example , " a color like it was a liquid .
In this case , we have three Siftable of configuring great-slats and I can use them to be used to be pushing color in the central , where they mix .
and I can use them to fix color in that central , where they mix .
We 're too too , we can put a little bit of it .
And there are also beautiful possibilities of learning , like language , the mathematics and logic games where people can try things to try to do fast , and see the results results immediately .
Now I 'm now --
This is a Fibonacci sequence I 'm doing with a program of equations .
Here we have a words game between Scarabeous and Boble .
Pratically , at every turnal you get a letter , in every Siftable , Pratically , to every turnal you get a letter in any way of Siftable , and you try and try and and try and try and try and and try and try and try and try and try and and try and and try and and try and compare them with words him to be controlending words .
Then , after about 30 seconds , they 're remix , and you have a new letters to try .
Thank you .
Here 's the children came to Media Lab , I did so that I tried them and I spent a video .
They are very pleased to them .
And one of the interesting things like this kind of applies , is that you don 't have to give people a lot of education .
You just say , " Compons of words , and they know exactly what to do .
Here 's what people try it .
This is our younger frightening , there on the right .
It was actually wanted to impilling them .
They were only morning in the morning .
Now , this is a little bit of an interactive cardgear .
We wanted to build a tool for the apprentice of Luix languages is Felix .
It can insert new characters in the scene , and you 're associated with them .
It can insert new characters in the scene , and you 're associated with them .
So , he 's doing the sun .
Video : The sun is surprising .
David Merrill : Now she took a treatment in the scene .
Video : The treattor .
Bel work ! Yeah !
So , you know , the Siftable and put them close to the characters --
Video : Bau !
-- by inventing their story .
Video : Hi !
DM : It 's a story with the open , and it can decide him how you 're going to do it .
DM : It 's a story with the open , and it can decide him how you 're going to do it .
Video : Fly .
DM : The last example I have time to show you is a tool , it 's a recenter , to championing and exececececection .
It 's a tool , made of recent , to tramples and exececutilies .
The Siftable here , based on the sound as basic and the battery .
Each of these have four different variations , and you can choose which use .
You can also put these sound in a sequence to get to your pleasure .
And you just move it by by making a sound and a sequence . "
These are effects that you can control from the vial , like reverber and filter .
The attacks to a particular sound and then inclens to enjoy it .
And then there are the general effects like time and volume , which is applied in the sequence .
Let 's look at how it works .
Video : We 'll start putting a base in two Siftable in two Siftable , " sequence , " We systems it into a series , we 'll add it , add it .
Now I 'll put a lapon line .
Video : I add the percussions --
Video : And I 'll now put the filter to the bacteria , so I can check the face of the face .
Video : I can fast the whole sequence of the entire sequence sequence time by one side .
Video : And I 'm going to add the lowest filter to get more expression .
Video : I can recombine the sequence of the flight .
So I don 't have to plan it before , but I can improvisate , make it longer or a shelter .
And now , finally , I can can spend the whole sequence on the left , the Siftable , " volume . "
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is to build new most-machine interfaces how our brain work and body .
And today , I have time to show you one of the results of this path , and also some chance we try to bring out of the lab .
The concept I want to transmit is that 's coming this new generation of designed designed to interact with digital media , which will bring information in our world in the way we want .
Thank you very much .
I don 't see the time to talk to all of you .
I 'm a writer .
Scriting books is my profession , but it 's more than this , of course .
It 's also love and the fascination of my life .
And I don 't expect that it can change .
But , I said , something particular happened to my life and my career , which brought me to get the whole relationship with this work .
The particular thing is I recently wrote this book , this whography called " Mangia , " Ama , I , I 'm just diversally from my books , for some reason why did books , for some reason why came out in the world and became a great , international ,
And the result is that everywhere is going to be now , people treat me as if I was convicted .
Really -- you know , convicted !
They 're all going to me now and they say , " Do you don 't care to do any more ?
Do you don 't care to continue to write life without being able to create a book that can be important to someone ? "
that can be importing to someone ? "
It 's unsevere , you know .
But it may go worse , except , I remember that I 'm over 20 years ago , when I started saying to people -- I was a teenager -- I wanted to be a writer .
I went up to the same reaction that was based on the fear .
And people said , " Don 't I 'm not going to be successful ?
Do you don 't care that the humiliation of you kill you ?
Do you don 't care to do this mestiving all of life without nothing to come up and die on a cumulation of the infrants with the mouth of bedded with the mouth to add to the failure ? "
So , you know .
The answer -- the short answer to all these questions is , " Yes . "
Yes , I 'm afraid of all those things .
I always have fear .
And I also feel fear of many other things that people cannot guess .
As the algae and other things really frightening .
But , as much as I would write what I thought and ask me , I would ask myself , why ?
Is it rational ?
It 's logical that anyone is supposed to be frightened by a job that you feel born to do .
But what 's so particular , in the impress that we have to make us nervous health care about increases in a way that other career don 't do ?
How my father , for example , he was a chemistry engineer and I don 't remember one time in his 40 years of activity that was asked if he was afraid to be engineer ?
There was never -- that block of engineer John , how do it goes ?
It didn 't work like that , you know ?
Onestly , chemical engineers like group don 't certainly , in the centuries , in the centuries , they 're managed to depressive .
We have enough writers , we have enough this reputation , and not just writers , but creatives of all kinds of things , we have this reputation of being enormous .
And it 's not to look at the sad of contextual magnificments that , only in the 21st century , they died young people and often to them .
And the ones that don 't have suicidated , they seem to be really disfaced by their dundlevels .
Norman Mailer , before I die , in the last interview , in the last interview , " I 've been a little more " an extraordinary affermation about the work of their life .
But we don 't get it to say , because we 've heard these things so long as we 've heard so long long that somehow we have completely interized and accepted the notion that creativity and suffering are somehow tied and the art , it will always be a little bit of tilt and that art , in the end , it will always always always be to the analysis .
And the question I want to ask all of this today is : are you agree with this idea ?
You 're OK , that 's OK , because it 's just just looking at it from a centimeter of me not good for anything supporting .
I think it 's hated .
And I think it 's dangerous and I don 't want to see the perpetuated perpetuated in the next century .
I think it 's better encouraging our big creative minds to live .
And I certainly know , in my case -- in my situation -- it would be very dangerous to start smoking out to that dark the support of the circumstances that I 'm in my career .
That 's what -- you know , they 're pretty young , I have about 40 years .
I still have about four decades of work in me .
And it 's a lot of anything I written about now , it 's going to be judged by the world like the work that came out after my last book .
I 'm going to be slavery , because we 're all more or less friends here -- it 's my biggest success is my shoulder .
Oh , Gesus , who thought !
You know this is the kind of thought that leads a person to start behing gin the nine of the morning and I don 't want to do it .
I would keep doing this work that I love .
So , the question becomes , how ?
And so , I think , after many reflections , that the way to keep writing is to create a psychological struction , OK ?
I have to find a way of security between me , which I 'm writing , and my natural anxime , which reaction is that it will be going to get . And I was trying to do for all the last year , trying to find other companies to see if they could be able to see if they could have more and more healthy ideas to see if they could have more healthy ideas have more and more healthy ideas , and I 'm trying to find some of the best ideas ,
about how to help people creative managing emotivity of creativity .
And that research took me to the Grek and Rome to the ancient Grek and Rome .
I 'm going to be gave in a circle and then it comes back .
In the ancient Grek and and Rome -- people didn 't seem to believe that creativity self-creating sell from men , OK ?
And it was thinking about creativity was this spirit look at the men , and they were to come to the men from some of unknown source , for reasons .
The Greeks called these spirites were called the demon creativity . "
Socrate , wonderful , he believed to have a demon that wisdom wisdom .
The Roomis of the same idea , but they called the species of spirit without a genius .
which is great , because Roomen didn 't really think that a genius was a very , very clever .
They believe that a genius was this kind of divine that was in the walls of an artist , a little bit like the elpho Dobby , and that was sort of elphus , and they come out to assisting out to assistery the job of the artist 's job of hidden and modeling the result of that work .
Extual -- here 's the distance of which I talk about -- that psychological construction that you protected to your work .
And everybody knew it was so that it worked , right ?
So the anti-artists were protected to some things , like , for example , too much of example , no ?
If your work was exceptional , you couldn 't get all the deserve , everyone knew that you were helped by this incorporate genius .
If your work failed , it wasn 't all your hit , right ?
Everybody knew it was your genius to be an incapable .
And so people are han conceived creativity in the West for a long time .
And then the Renciement came and everything changed , and it changed , and we put the human being in the center of the universe above all of the universe and mysteries and no mysteries to leave space creatures that you 're windity .
This was the principle of humanth and people started to think that creativity was completely from hydness .
And for the first time in history , you start to referred to this or artist as a genius rather than a person in the genius .
And I have to tell you , I think it was a big grassror .
I think I enjoying someone , a simple person to believe that they 're like a recipient like the source , the source and source of all the mysteries , creativity and ethernal responsibility is a big one to a file too much to give to the fragile psyches .
It 's as to ask someone to enjoy the sun .
Demand , completely distores the ego and creates all these ingestishes on performance .
And I think it was this pressure to have destroyed the artists in the passed 500 years .
And if this is true , and I think it 's , the question becomes , and now ?
Can we do it differently ?
Maybe back to a more ancient understanding of the relationship between human and creative mystery creative mystery .
Or maybe not .
Perhaps we can 't sing 500 years old of rational thinking in a talk about 18 minutes .
And there 's probably people in the audience that would solve to suspects scientific support on the notion of , you know , they follow the people by giving spend of their projects .
I 'm probably not going to convince you all about this .
But the question I 'd like to ask is -- why isn 't it ?
Why don 't you think that way ?
Because it 's more sense of anything else I ever heard about to explain the exasperant impremobility of the creative process .
A process that , as anyone who ever tried to do something -- so , it 's basically , everybody here -- you don 't know rationally .
And , in fact , sometimes it can be completely paranormal .
I did this meeting recently with the extraordinary poetry Stone , who has now 90 years , but he was a poetry for all life and told me that during his childhood in the rural Virginia , worked out out in the camps , and he was out of it , when a poem was in the way .
He said he was like a fragorous train of air .
And he was rotoling to her from the landscape .
He felt it , because he was to tremendous the land under its feet .
He knew you have one thing to do at that point and he was of , " running like a matt . "
And so he would run home and she was infollowed by this poem , and it wouldn 't have to get a piece of paper and a fast enough of paper and trapping it , and they would pick it up , and they would pick it up to the page .
Sometimes , he couldn 't be able enough , so it corrective and correct and running out and running out and he would not get to home and the rotoling her rotoling through and she lost and he would continue to rotoling through the landscape , and she was looking for , as a poet . "
Then there was some times -- this piece I 'm never going to forget it -- there were almost losing , OK ?
So , he was running home and he was looking for paper and he was looking for paper and she was a pencil in the way he was going , and then he said , which was like if you flew with the other hand and step the path .
He was going to go to the coda and remain his body and remain his body and transcriting it on the page .
And in these cases , the poem would be on the perfect page and intact , as the last word to the first one .
So when I heard it -- it 's crazy , it 's exactly the equal of my creative process .
Not all my creative process -- I 'm not a conviction !
I 'm a mule , and my way to work is , wake up to wake up and to work and pass it , and I 'll go to work and pass it over the goffly .
But even I have a little bit , in my head , I 've been brought against that thing , sometimes .
And I think many of you are han in fact .
You know , even if the work and ideas would come to me from a certain source you can 't honestly know .
And what is this thing ?
And how can we relate to it so that we don 't lose your head , but , rather , what do we do you get healthy ?
I mean , I 'm the best contemporary example I have is the Myst Tom Waits , which I interviewed years years ago for a newspaper .
We were talking about this , and you know , Tom , for the majority of life is reported the incarnation of the incarnation of the time , trying to control , manage , to dominate , to deal , to dominate these species of impults .
But then he got to , and he was driving on a street highway in Los in Los Angeles , changed all for him .
He was going to fast and everything , and all of a traits of this little framment , which comes in his head as the inspiration , and the wants , elusive and alettant , and the wants , and the despite , but it doesn 't know how to take it .
It 's not a piece of paper , it doesn 't have a matt , it has no registrator .
So he starts to feel this species of old anximium growing up in him , " I 'm going to losing , and I 'll rehhaunted by this song ,
I 'm not good enough and I can 't do it . "
And instead of going to go to the panic , stop .
He fit the whole process of mental and made something completely new .
He just just just the sky and said , " Scuses , you know , I 'm driving ? "
" To you feel like to write a song now ?
If you really want to exists , you go back to a more opporting when I can take care of you .
Otherwise , you 're going to importunill someone else today .
You go to disturbing Leonard Cohen . "
And his process changed after this .
Not the work , the work was still dark as always .
But the process , and the heavy anxiety that was remained when the genius , the genius that was going to fit back back from where he was , by doing it was remaining it back from where it was , by doing that it didn 't have to be a interized and remaining it .
but you don 't have Tom , wonderful bizarre collaboration between Tom and this strange and external thing that was not Tom .
So , as I felt that story started to change a little bit how I was working and I was already saved me .
This idea , I was writing " Mangia , Prega , " Ama , and falls in one of those caddy of the disperation that we 're caused all to do with something and we don 't even get it to think that will be a disaster , which is going to be the worst book that ever written .
Not just ugly , the worst book written .
And I started to think of throwing this project .
But then I remind to Tom who was talking to the air and I tried to me .
So I got my face up to my face on the manufacturing and I committed my commenter a empty of the room .
And I said , " Look , what , both of course , if this book is not going to be bright , you know that if this book is not going to be brilliant , no ?
Because I 'm putting all I 'm putting everything I don 't have any more than this .
So if you want it to be better , you have to show you and do your part .
OK . But if you don 't do it , you know what , I don 't do it .
I 'm going to writing the same because it 's my work .
And I 'd like to do today that I 've been shown today to me to do my part , " Because -- finally , OK -- in the end , OK --
And they were magnificent , because the dancers were professionals and they were great .
But every so , rarely , something happened , and one of these artists became transforming .
And I know you know what I 'm talking about , because I know you all seen , at a point , a performance so .
It was like if the time was stopped , and the dancing walked through a kind of landscape and it wasn 't a different one from the usual , but everything was trained .
And suddenly , it doesn 't seem like a human .
But he 's on the diinside and under the illuminated in the fire of divinity .
And when this happened , in the time , people knew what was , they called him .
They had their hands and start to sing , " Allah , Allah , Allah , God , God , God , "
That 's God , you know .
Curious note -- when the Mori invaded Spain , I got this habitude with them and the ready to change in the centuries from " Allah , Allah , Allah , Allah , Allah , " to " Ole , " which you can still feel in the courries or in the flamp .
In Spain , when a artist did something impossible and magical , " Allah , " Allah , I was , I was , " Alah , " incomprehensible , " -- a last of God .
And it 's great because we need it .
But , the problem comes the next day , for the dance , when you wake up and discover that 's 11-morning , and it 's last last 1th of God , and the last of God is no longer .
It 's just a mortal with grant glasses , and perhaps it will never get that heavily to that heavily .
And maybe nobody will sing the name of God 's coming in , and what does it have to do with the rest of his life ?
It 's hard .
This is one of the most painful recogniliations to do in a creative life .
But perhaps it doesn 't have to be so angoscious if you can 't believe , in fact , that the most extraordinary aspects of your being come to yourself .
But you know , you just believe that 's prested data that 's a inimaginable source of this team , you have to get someone else when you finished .
And , you know , if we think that way everything changes .
And so I started thinking about it , and it 's certainly how I thought about several months during the book I 'm going to admit , the dangerous , I 'll attesight , followed , I went to my great success .
And what I have to continue to tell me when I feel electric .
Not just flowing you . It 's just your work .
It 's a presenting to your side , any can be .
If your work is dance , you know .
If the divine , absurd genius to assigned decide to leave some kind of wonderful , for one moment through your efforts , then " Ole . "
Otherwise , you do the same dance .
And " Ole ! " to yourself .
I think , and I think I should teach it .
" Ole ! " to yourself , just for having human love and testing aggas wild and testing tale of your aggas to be removed .
Thank you .
Thank you .
June Cohen : Ole !
And as you know I talked about some of these projects on the human genome , what can meant and on the discovery of new set of genes .
Now we 're starting a new path : we started digitizing biology and now starting from that digital code , we 're coming into a new biology , we 're going to go into a new phase of biology , designing and wintetizing and winter and wintetizing life .
We always tried to ask to ask great questions .
" What is life ? " It 's something that many biologists have tried to understand various levels .
We tried different approaches , reduced it to minimes .
We 're digitizing from almost 20 years .
When we sequenced the human genome was to passing from the analome of the computer world digital digital world of the computer .
Now we ask us : can we regenerate life , or create new life from this digital universe ?
This is the map of a little organism , Mycoplasma genitalium , which is the smallest genome from the smallest genome between the replication .
And we tried to reduce the genome to create a smaller .
We can get to eliminate a hundred genes of about 500 that are here .
But when we look at his metabolic map , it 's relatively simple than our .
And I think , this is simple .
But when we look at all genes that we can get to , one at the time , it 's very unlikely that this can bring a living cells .
So we decided that the only way to procrete was syntheship this chromosoma so that we could get the components to the components to bring some of these fundamental questions .
And so we started the adventure of " CCCCCCan CCCCan Cromosome ? "
Can the chemistry to try to make these big molecules that we never have to create before ?
And , in case , can we make a chromosome ?
A chromosome is just a piece of chromosome .
The speed that we 're able to digitize life is growing to report life is growing to report .
Our genetic capability , instead , progret rather slowly , but it 's a very slowly improving .
And our most recently results the recently exponential curve .
We started over 15 years ago .
The process required many passages , starting with a bioetical revision , first experiments .
But we found that synthesize DNA is very difficult .
There are tens of thousands of cars in the world that make little DNA segments , of 30 to 50 lectery and it 's a degenerative process : the most segment is longer , the segment is longer , there are .
So we had to develop a new method to assemble these fragments and correct the mistakes .
And this was our first attempt , starting to go from the digital genome of Phi 's genome 174 .
It 's a little virus that kills .
We designed the framments , effectied the correction of errors and achieved a DNA molecule of about 5,000 letter .
The interesting part is when we took this chemical chemical material , and we put it in bacteria , the bacteria have started reading this genetic code and to viral particles .
The viral particles have been released by the cells , they went back and destroyed the E.
I talked about recent with the oil industry and say , they certainly say , they 're sure that they 're certainly compressed this model .
They have more than you .
We believe this is a situation where software can really build its own hardware in a biological system .
But we wanted to do things bigger in big .
We wanted to build the whole chromosome of the bacteria .
They 're over 580 thousand milletter to genetic code .
So we thought we build it in the size of the virus , so that we can change the cassets to understand what are the components of a living cells .
The design is critical , and if we start with digital information in a computer , these must be very accurate .
When we sequence this genome for the first time in 1995 accuracy room was a mistake for every 10 thousand lower .
We found it , 30 mistakes . If we had 30 mistakes . If we used that original sequence we wouldn 't have ever been able to do it work .
One part of the process is to design 50 leck leckers that overlawyers with all the other 50 letter to build underneath and to build subunits smaller than working together .
We try to unique the unique elements here .
You probably read that we probably read that we put in the blind of the bypboard .
So , think about this : we have a genetic code based on four letters : A , C , C , Gs and T.
Three of those letters meet together with about 20 lominoacids , and there 's a specific order to reading every friendly order to reading for every friending .
So we can use genetic code to write words , sentences , thinking .
What we did in the beginning was autographed to do it .
Some have been deluses from the fact that it wasn 't poem .
We designed these segments just uns them unquenzyme .
There are enzyme that they repair them and put them on them .
And we started assembles , starting with the parts , starting with segments , and start with segments that are uncles to 24 thousand letter to them them them .
And in every step , we produced these segments in abundance so that we 're trying to create an extremely robust -- how you see in a minute .
We 're trying to automatize the process .
So , this seems like the tabellon of a lowket player .
When we get these very long , over 100 thousand lowers , they 're not going to grow more directly in E.
It 's at the limit of modern biology of molecular biology .
So we 've been considered other mechanisms .
We knew about another mechanism called recombination , which in biology to recombination , that in biology is ulaughing to join DNA segments .
Here 's an example .
This organism , called Deinococcus radiodurs , can absorbation , can absorbation .
You can see in the upper square like his chromosome as the chromosome .
In 12 , 24 hours , it 's been reassembled as before .
There are thousands of organisms that they can do it .
These organisms can completely sit .
They can live under a vacuum .
They 're absolutely sure that life exists in space , and you feel to find new water environments of water .
ASA showed that this is , NASA showed that this is .
This is a picture of the molecule we built using these processes , just using these processes , just using the lievision of segments to insert .
The lights assembled them automatically .
This picture wasn 't taken with a microscope with a microscope , but with a microscope .
It 's a molecule that we can see it with a microscope .
These are pictures that cover a period of about six seconds .
This is the ad advertising that little time ago .
They 're over 580,000 lectery ,
It 's the biggest molecule than a defined structure ever created by human .
It 's got a 300 molecular fish at 300 million .
If you spaces it with a 10 without spaces , it would like to take 142 pages to just transclaunch this genetic code .
Now , how do we do it work ? How can we do it ?
Of course , you 're through a virus is a game of kids .
It 's a little bit more complicated when they use bacteria .
It 's easier when it comes to eucariariote like our : you can just extract nucleus , and you can just extract on another , which is basically the process of clonation .
In the archaea bacteria , the chromosome is instead integrated inside , but we recently demonstrated that we 're able to do a complete transplant of one cell to another and to activate it .
We clean a cross where we were from a microbial cycle .
The two are several of the men from mice .
We have added some genes more so that we can decide what choice for this chromosome .
And then I 'm skip with enzyme so that you can kill all the proteins .
And when we put it in the cell was astern amazing -- and you 'll open our sophisticatoo-- the new chromosome -- the new chromosome .
And we started thinking that we couldn 't go beyond , but we tried to spinging us more in there .
This is one of the major mechanisms of evolution .
We found that a lot of anti-species have added a second or a third chromosome somewhere , added in a second thousand tracts in a second thousand tracts in that species .
So who think about evolution as only one gene , it didn 't understand a lot of biology .
They have enzyme called restraight enzyme , which enjoyed to digit out DNA .
The chromosome that was in the cell not one .
The cellphone , the chromosome that we have inserit-down .
It 's expressed , and he recognized the other exterm chromosome , he masticated it , and we found it with only the cell and the new chromosome .
It became blue because of the genes we put in .
And in a short few leaves , all the characteristics of a species , have gone . And it turned all into a new species , based on the new software that we put in the cell .
All the proteins have changed , the membrane changed , and when we read the genetic code is exactly what we 've transfered to the genetic code is exactly what we 've transfered .
Now , this may seem to seem to be genetic altering , but we can change things in a substantial enough .
Now , I 've already explained that this is not about genesis -- but to progress from three million years and a half years , and I said that maybe we 're probably going to create a new version of Cambrian explosion of Chriana exchange where they 're going to create new species on this process .
Why do this ?
I think it 's obvious enough when we think about our needs .
We 're going to move from six billion and a half billion people in the next 40 years .
Just to give an example : I was born in 1946 .
Now there are three people on the planet for each existent in 1946 , there will be four .
We 're having problems now to find food , fresh water and clean , medical water and gas for six and a half billion people .
It 's going to be more harder to do it for nine billion .
We use more than five billion carbon , more than 30 billion fuel , more than 30 billion buaries .
That means 100 million barrel a day .
When we try to find biological processes , or any kind of process to replace them , it 's going to be a huge challenge .
We have to keep the whole hemimission of CO2 from these materials that falls in the atmosphere .
At day , thank you to scientific discoveries all over the world , we have a database with about 20 million genes , and I like to think they 're the design components for the future .
The electronics has only one dozen about components , and think about how many different things are coming out of .
Our limitations here are the data that is the reality and our imagination .
Now we have some techniques , because of these rapid methods , to create what we call combinatory genomics .
We can build a big robot that can produce a million chromosomes a day .
Think of processing these 20 million different genes or to try to optimize the processes to produce eight drugs , new vaccines , we can change , thank you very small team , and create more biology now that in the last 20 years of science .
And it 's just a standard selection .
We can choose to survival , chemical production or fuel , or fuel production , or fuel production .
This is a instantly of some software programming programming that we 're working to be able to be able to seat us and design species to computers .
Well , we don 't necessarily know how it will be .
We know exactly what their genetic code .
Now we 're focused on the fourth of the fourth generation .
You also have seen that you can extract ethanol was a final experiment ,
We have a second and third generation that 's going to use enough to be the delyballer than the eight-up sugar or different kinds of butants .
But the only way biology can have a great impact without increasing much more impacts the cost of food and limitaren a sense of food and limitary the CO2 to matter before , so we 're working on to design cells that can reach to this purpose , and we can have the first carbons of the first ones that can have the first carbon of four times in about 18 months .
The solar light combined with CO2 is a metodo-- but in our discoveries all over the world , we have found different metods .
This is a organism we described in 1996 .
It lives in the deep ocean , at about 2,500 feet deep at the temperature of water .
They create meter from CO2 using molecular as energy source of energy .
We 're trying to understand if we can uncanalate CO2 , which can easily be transported through your tubs , converting that CO2 in the fuel , to drive this process .
So , to short think we can be able to increase what the basic question of " which , " What is life " is " We , greater -- we have the modres-up -- we have the modreserating the whole oil industry .
Exactly . If you can 't do it from TED , where can you ?
It would become a main energy source .
And also , we 're working to use the same metods to create instantaneous vaccines .
You 've seen this year with flu , we 're always back to a year and with a dollar , and we 're always back to the right vaccine .
I think what you can change by building vaccines in a little bit of inables .
And this future could start to seem changing , now , the tree of evolution , now , the evolution of the synthetic bacteria , I would say , " Teucariariariote cells .
We 're so from improving people .
Our purpose is to do it , we can live enough enough to try to do it . Thank you very much .
First of all , I 'm going to show you , the fastest possible , some fundamental work we 've taken to Microsoft , followed to a year ago . This is Seadragon .
It 's a environment that you can interact is to the local level that you can remotion with a huge amount of visual data .
Here we 're seeing a lot of gigabyte photos of digital phoom , and for a little bit of a continuous zoom , for a ve-panoramic fast , and we want these pictures of these things .
And it doesn 't matter how big the amount of information we see , how big these things are great data or images .
Most of them are common digital photographs , but this is a scanning provenient from the Library of Congress , and reenter the game-thick gamel .
It does not make any difference because the only thing that limits the prestations of a system like this is the number of pixel on your screen in any time . It 's also a very flexible architecture .
This is a book , for example , not the images .
This is the Casa desolated of Dickens . Every colonna represents a chapter .
To show you that it 's just like , and not images , we can do something like that , to actually show that this is a real real representation of the text , not a picture .
It may be a way a little artificial to read an electric book .
Not a little bit of a .
This is a more realistic example . It 's a number of The Guardian .
Every picture is the beginning of a section .
And it gives you the pleasure and the beauty experience to read the real real cardry of a magazine or newspaper , which is for nature moltex .
We also did something with the corner of this number in the corner of The Guardian .
We 've created a higher advertising ads -- much higher than what you use in a normal advertising -- and we have put extra content of extra content .
If you want to see the characteristics of this automobile , you can see this here .
Or other models , or even the specific techniques .
And this really shows some of these ideas to eliminating limits of space on the screen .
And hopefully , that means to put a pop-up and other porcheries like , I don 't have to be necessarily .
Of course , the map is one of the most obvious applications for this kind of technology .
And I don 't want to lose time , if we don 't say we have contribute to even this field .
These are all the street in the U.S. about a NASA geospace on a NASA geospace .
So , we 're going to go to something else .
This is now now , you can go to the web ; you can go to see it .
It 's a project called Photosynthy , which combine two different technologies .
One is Seadragon and the other is a visual research at a very interesting computer that was done by Noah Snavely , a student of Washington , with Steve Seitz of UW Seitz of Microsoft Rick Szeliski of Microsoft Rick . Agan , " op-laimation . Again , "
And it 's from the alive on the web , managon .
You can see it when we do this kind of screen , where we can go from an image to the other and have this kind of experience to the multiple resolution .
But the space collocation of the images here actually a meaning .
And the computer algorithms of computers have been recorded these images , so that they have to restable to the real places that are -- all sthms of the Rockets of the Rockenes -- they 've been taken up to the Rocket Montagne Rockets -- they 've been taken . Here , you see of a de-de-show , and these things have been all lined at level .
I don 't know if I have time to show you some other environment .
There are a lot more space .
I want to go directly to one of the Noah-- and this comes from a preceder prototype of Photosynth-up , which we 've done the first summer , to show you what I think is really the key to do this thing that I think is really the key key to this technology , the Photosynthy , and it 's not necessarily evident that we have put in the website .
We had to worry about legal aspects and so on .
This is a re-built of Notre Dame images in Notre Dame images in Flickr , Bast digitary Notre Dr. And you get pictures of the campuzzles , other campus and so on . And each of these things , and so on . And , one of these conants , the same arange is discovery .
So , they 're all images in Flickr and they 've been connected to space in this way .
And it 's possible to navigate this very simple way .
You know , I never thought I 'd be finally working for Microsoft .
It 's very gratifying you get this kind of acacovery here .
I think you can see that it 's a lot of different kinds of photochambers : from those mobile phones to those SLR professional , a number of significant , put together in this environment .
And if I can , I try to find those strange .
A lot of people are stuck , etc .
Some of some part here is a series of photographs -- here 's a series of photographs -- it .
This is a poster of Notre Dame recorded correctly .
We can go from the poster to the physics of this environment .
The essential point is that we can do things with social environment . This is now taking data from the whole whole memory of how to appear the land , from the whole stage of view -- and connecting all of those data together .
All those pictures become connected together , more than the sum of the parts .
You have a model of the land that emerges .
Think about this as a prolungaming of Stephen Lawler on Earth 's virtual .
It 's something that grows in complexity as as as people use it , and the people who use it increase with the use of use .
Their pictures are husbed with inseries by other people .
If you get the idea of contrast all these sorts of things , and my name , my cattedral of Notre Damn suddenly enriches of all those data , and I can use it as a point of enterprise to immerate as a sense of immermermerges in that metapuniverse , using the pictures of them up and red by the cross-to-shelf experience .
Of course , a consequence of all of this are virtual models , all of the interesting models of every interesting part of the earth , collecting not just as you can open to view and similar images and similar images and similar images and similar pictures and similar pictures and , but from the memory .
Thank you .
Chris Anderson : I understand ? What your software is going to tell you about doing is that you 're going to give you a point , in the next few years , all of the photographs are going to be practically connected together ?
BAA : Yeah . What he 's basically discovered is to find .
It 's creating hyperlinks , if you want , between images .
And he 's in the base of the content of the images .
The thing becomes very interesting if you think about the semantes of semantement information that many of these images .
As when you do a research research on the web , you get a sentence and the text on the web page of this web page has a lot of information about pictures .
Now , what happens if that picture is that picture of all your pictures ?
So the amount of semantical interconnection and the amount of wealth that comes out is really enormous . It 's a classic effect of the network .
CA : Blaise , it 's really amazing . Compliments .
BAA : Thank you very much .
One of the main pleasure when you travel and one of the delivers of the ethnographics is that we can live between who doesn 't forgot antial traditions , those have been plant to the past in the wind , the stone in the wind , the stone of the plant plant , levering it in the stone of the plants .
Baster think that the sciamans Jaguar travel to beyond the Lattea , or that the monitites Inuit are still meaning , or Himalayas , the buddists still the breath of Dharmful , to remind the respire of the Dharmful anthropology , and the idea that the world that the central world , and the idea that the world we live in unabsolute , but it 's just a model of reality , but it 's just a model of reality ,
the consequence of a particular adaptive set of adaptive choices that our areas has done , well , many generations do .
And , of course , we all share of essential traits .
We all procreating .
We are subjects to reinitiation .
We have to deal with the inesorability of deed , so we don 't surprise us to go and whom we 're whom we 're whom we 're going to --
We all have an art .
What hits is the particular rhythm of the song , the rhythm of dance .
It doesn 't matter that they 're the Penan of Borneo , or the following Vodoo 's Vodoo 's the following of Haiti , or desert warrior desert warrior desert Curandarsut , the Curandarer of Ande , or a cammers called the Hahara har in the heart of the Sahara .
He was my journey companies in desert a month ago , or a yatheist of the yatheast , on the Everest , the dead mother of the world .
All these people are teaching us that there are other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , other ways of moving around the world .
And if you think a moment , it 's a concept that it can give you hope .
Insies , with the myriades of the world create a spiritual life and cultural life that is happening the planet and it 's important to the well-being of the planet and it 's important to the planet as biosphere .
And you can think of this cultural rague as a ethnosphere and you can define the total sum of all the conception of human beings , mites , mites , mites , ideas , inspiration , and also , mites , and mites , and mites , and you can deal with the human imagination of human consciousness .
The etnosphere is the fantastic patrial patrial of humanity .
It 's the symbol of what we are and what we can be as inquisitive species .
And because the biosphere was a gravally consumed as as a as a button , and unfortunately much faster .
Nobody biological , for example , it would say that 50 percent of all species was or is on the orders just as a fake of the extinction just because it 's fake , or -- in the field of biological diversity -- and not even even close to the most apocalypocalm -- that 's the most apocalf of cultural diversity .
The index of all that is , of course , the language .
When you were born 6,000 languages on this planet .
A language is not only a vocabulary of a series of rules .
A language is the human spirit of the human spirit .
It 's the half the animal world comes in the material world .
Every language is a forest of the mind , a backin , a thinking , a reecosystem possibilities .
And of those 6,000 languages , as we are here in Monterey , at least half the unsurrying in Monterey , at least half it 's not surrounds in the children .
They 're no longer teaching children , which means , unless you have something , which is already debates something , which are already dead .
What is the smart is that you have the silence , the last talking to a language , the last speak , of the last speaker , of course , or to anticipate the promise of the promise of children ?
This is orring , it was in some of the world every two weeks , every two weeks a muor a muor and door with them in the tombol of a ancient language .
And I know someone you 're saying , " Not that much better ?
Wouldn 't it be a better place if we talk to all the same language ? "
We talk about kogue .
You 're going to be a tracks like , we can 't talk to talk about their language .
I 'd like to like to do a journey through the thnosphere --
a little journey in the etnosphere to give you a hip of what we 're losing .
A lot of us forgot that when I say , " different ways of existing ways of existing .
We take for example this Barasana baby , in the Specentrional settentrional , the population of anacond , creates the myth to come from the river of waste in the waste sacond sacond sacred sacred saconia .
It 's a popular people who don 't have to distinguish the blue blue from the green because you were identified in the forest , which depends on the time , which depends on the popular .
They have a strange language and a matrimonial rule , said , " You have to married a person who 's talking to a different language .
And all that has radical past the mitological past , though the particular particular particular is that in these families are talking about six or seven languages of marriages , they talk about six or seven languages of marries .
They 're limitate to listen and then they start talking .
We take one of the most interesting tribes I lived , the Waorans of Ecuador north , a incredible popular popular that had the first contacts in 1958 .
In 1957 , five missionaries have been trying to make a failure contact .
They did come down the upon the photographs that they thought they would love that they would have loving them , and forgot that this population of pluvial forest , that this population of pluvial forest .
They picked up the land , they 've been picked them to the research of a shape or a shape and , not finding nothing , they finally finally , they would have the five missionaries with the lance .
But the Waorans don 't just have to kill the foreign .
They were killed between them .
54 percent of the mortality was caused by themselves .
We have answers to eight generations and we found two cases of natural mored and when we insist , they had admitted that one of them was aged so that he was so aged that he was so enjoying , and then killed him the same .
The hunters were able to recognize the urine animal urine from 40 steps and recognize the species .
In the earlier ' 80s , I was assigned a very interesting task when my Harvard professor asked me if I wanted to go to Haiti to to Haiti to enjoy them in the basic power of Duvalier and Tonton Macodes and Tonton Macodes and Tonton Macodes and I would be on the sheep used zomombies .
To give a sense to the miraculous , I should have understand Vodoun culture , and that Vodoo isn 't magic .
It 's quite a complex metapphysics of the world .
Many interesting .
If I asked you to tell me the great religions of the world , what would you say ?
Cristianism , Islam , Buddism , Ebraism , etc .
A continent is always left out , thinking that sub-Saharan Africa doesn 't have any religious feeling . And they 're and Vodoo is not the other than the distilside of these religious concepts in the tragic concepts in the tragic concepts in slavery .
What makes the voodoo is the intended up between life and death .
So , you know , they hide the spirits .
The spirits can be invocated by the Great Acqua , they respond to the rhythm of the dance of the vision of the vial way that for a short way of the following becomes the god .
So , the voodooists love to say , " You white go to church of God .
We give God in the temple and we 'll say God . "
And from the moment you 're marseats , it 's the spirit you , how can you do it , how are you going to hurt you , how can you do it ?
So you have to these incredible events : follow in the state of trance that touch trance impunties that touch impunties a demonstration rather strong of the power of the mind when it 's catalyzed in a state of exciting extreme .
At all the people I lived the most extraordinary of Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta , in Colombia in the Santa Marta , in Colombia .
It was a re-based civilization that once they were living on the charaiban planes of Colombia 's attending , the popular ritiated , the popular race that 's the vulcanic massive planning that is required on the charge of charge .
In a continent macchievement of blood , this popular never been conquisted by the way ,
And now , they 're governmented by a clerd , but their formation is so extraordinary .
The young people follow them come out of the families to three or four years , and live secreates in a world that 's made of dark and shadows in the bottom of the glacier for 18 years .
Two periods of nine years of proposes to reproduce the nine months of management that spend in the useral of the mother , now are metaphorically , they 're metaphorically in the Great Mother .
For all this time , they 're acculturate to the values of their society , values that prerayers and only their prayers keep the cosmic balance -- or to say the balance balance ,
At the end of this incredible initiation , they 're suddenly taken out and for the first time in their life , to 18 years , they see an alba . And in that moment , when the sun is the value of the first stick , when the sun is valleys the beautiful value of beautiful , when the sun is value of the great required . And the predict a step back and says ,
" With ? Profirst how I told you .
It 's wonderful . Now it 's now about you protect it . "
They call greater brothers and say that we , and they say that we , the minor brothers , we are the destruction of the world .
This is a level of intuition is extremely important .
When we think about the Ingene populations and environment invote to the environment invacuum of noble , which is a concept of race in his simplicity , which is a concept of rice in his simplicity or maybe we are closer .
The Ingenes are not as an imental feeling or indeed by nostaly .
There 's no space for these things in the Asmaller 's palual palual , or the wintuition of Tibet , but thank you to the time and rates , they 've created a mystical of the Earth 's not about the concept of being consciously closer , but on an intuition , the concept that the Earth is only only only only only only only only only because it 's infused by human consciousness .
What does it mean ?
He means a kid that a kid who grow up in the mountain creating that mountain is a spirit of Apu that will be a human being a very different human being , and will have a human being different human being , and will have a very different relationship with the mountain that place to a boy that place to be taken off .
which is the demadly of a spirit or a mineral cutting is irrelevant .
What is interesting is the metaphor that debes the relationship between the individual world and natural world .
I grew up in the British forests in British 's that they would have to be cut .
And this made me a human being different from my friends that I think the Hamkiutl who believe that the Hamkukuk 's dimadly about and the blind 's historical beyond me and cannibal cannibal , who are living at the waste initiation of the world , I think they 're dealing with the Hamatsa .
If you start to consider that these cultures can create different realities , you can start to understand some of them feeling . We take this plants .
I took this stopped to the nordoctor in the nordoccival Amazon .
Mayatheist of you have heard about the ayahuash , the most powerful psychotive of the chiamanic repertorium .
What makes it fascinating the ayahuasca is not the potential to make the substance of substance , but his processing . It 's made by two things .
On one side , this laneous lianks that makes a series of beta-carboline , harmful and harmmful , slightly hallucinogenic .
Take the only plants , it 's a bluster that alterms a little bit of consciousness , but it 's measured with a little bit of coffee of a coffee family said Psychotria 's family redis .
This plant contains , powerful triptamine , very similar to the serotonine , dimethoxtamine-5 , methoxtamine-to-methoxtamine .
If you ever see Yanomami pulling on the nose of the nose that they do a different set of species , he contains for a different kind of set , it contains .
Tiring that powder , is a little bit like to be disappeared by a card of paper dipink , and landing on a sea of electricity . It doesn 't create a distorsion of reality ; it creates the dissolution of reality .
I was often a lot of my professor , Richard Evan Shultes , the man who had been psychc , with his discovery of the fungi was psychc , with his discovery of the hallucinogenic fungi in the ' 30s .
I think about my thesis , you can 't get these tripal as well as well as if you 're done not told to be hallucinated . And you can 't tell any of being hallucinated . And the tripal pamine , but they can 't be asorred by a enzyme , but it 's obsiously about it , and you know , and they hade-hold ,
It 's possible to be just assume if they 're assume with other chemicals that you know , you know , " MAO .
Now , the beautiful : The beauty : The coal is inhibitors that are in this liants are inhibited in the same kind of necessary to potential tripal . The question is the demand is spontaneous . The question is spontaneous , how do these people have two morogically not like these people , but if you combinate in this way , create a biochemical version that is superior to advice the examines ?
We use the great euthy of the proof of the proof the grandmother and error , which can reveal infrures .
But if you ask the Indians , they 'll tell us , " Pleant . "
What does it mean ?
This tribes , the Cofan has 17 varieties of ayahujahulal , who are narely in the forest , and that our eyes would remain the species .
If you ask them how they 're stopping their tassonoming , " I was going to tell us , " I thought , " I 'd say , " No . "
The solution is : you take 17 variety of a full and each one will sing with a different piece and each one will cannot with a tone .
With this not in Harvard , but it 's much more interesting to contact the stami .
Now , the problem is that the problem is that even the ones of us who have to heart people have painting their own peek , but somehow redots , but somehow redots to the margins of the real world , and it pass beyond .
In fact , the 20th century , it 's not going to be reminded to his wars or the technologies , but rather as the the thing that was where we 're stopped and actively embraced and actively accepted or passively accepted or passively accepted or passionately the problem of mass destruction of the planet . Now the problem is not change .
All the cultures through the centuries have been involved in a new life of life .
And the problem is not technology .
The Indians Sioux , they don 't have to be Sioux when they put them up and make it as reaches like as Americans don 't have any American people who have been in the horse and heat .
It 's not the change or technology that threatening the integrity of the ethnosphere . It 's the power .
The laster flight flight .
And if you look at the world , you 'll find that these are not destinated cultures destinated to disappear .
They 're living creatures and dynamics out of the existence of identifabulous creatures that go beyond their traits capacity to adaptation .
I know that it 's disboscation in the patria of Penan --
a popular Sarawasian nomed in Sarawasian , a popular popular , which has lived in the forest to a generation ago , and now reduced to the reduced to the reduct and prostitution on the revers , where you can see the rivers of the lim that seems to be a half of the Meridional Meridional Meridional Meridional Meridional , where you can see the horizon is the horizon ,
With the wood to fill the wood stands with the subtle .
Or , in the Yanomami , are the diseases that have come with the discovery of the gold .
If we move on to the Tibet of Tibet , where I 'm doing a lot of research , you 'll see the laster flight of politics .
As you know the genocide , the physics of a popular popular , it 's conviction , but the witem , the destruction of a population of life , not only is conviction , not only is convicted , but even celebrated in certain environments , because it does part of the strategy of development .
And you can 't understand the suffering of Tibet until you 're part of the beginning .
I 've spent the 6,000 miles from Chengdu in Westerdu , through Tibet , and coming in in Lhasa with a young colleague , but only come to Lhasa , but only arrived in Lhasa , I realized what 's behind the statistics we feel talking about .
6,000 sacres reduced in dust and cenjoyed .
1.2 million people killed by military during the Cultural Revolution .
The father of this guy was ascriticized at the Panchen Lama .
which means that it was killed in the time of Chinese invasion .
His uncle , I was worried with Sua during the diaspora that has led led led led to the popular in Nepal .
His mother was impried and his colpe was to be rich .
It was brought to the age of two years old old under his gonna because he couldn 't have a gonna because he couldn 't have live in him .
The sister , who did the same , it was put in reducing reducation .
One day he inaved a day , he inaved a waste of Mao and , for this transgression , was put on the jobs for seven years .
The Tibet of Tibet can be unoveroveroverwhelmed , but the reesterday of the people are present .
And then , all of the end , it reduces a choice .
Do we want to live in the monothy of monothy or want to do we want to get the mean of diversity of diversity ?
The great anthropologa , before he said , his biggest fear was that , in our way of the world , we 're going to see this amord of the world , not only to see the whole range of human imagination reduced to a limitate modality of human thinking , but one day we 're going to wake up from a sleeping modaling , but one day we 're going to see from a sleep sleep ,
And it 's umillion people remembering that our species is existed for 600,000 years .
The Neolitical Revolution , who gave us agriculture , which has done us subject to the seed of the seed of the seed of the skiaming , creating the shaman of the cline , creating hierarchy of specialization , and we talk about 10,000 years ago .
The modern world 's industrialized at the time .
That unexpected story is not suggests that we have the answers to all the challenge that we 're going to have to deal in millennia to come .
When they 're asking these cultures of the world is asked what it means human , they 're asking 10,000 different voices .
And it 's in these answers that we 're going to have the chance of being what we are : a conscious species , that has to make all the popular garden , and all the gardens can fire . And there 's great moments of optimism .
I took this picture on the northern extremity of Baffin island , when I went to the whaled with Inuit , and this man , Olayas , and this man , Olayas , and he told me the wonderful story of his grandfather .
The Canadian government wasn 't always gentle with the Inuit 's population and in the ' 50s to put our suprematic , we have them in colonies .
The grandfather of this man refuted to go .
The family , I tear his life , took them all the way , and all of his attitudes .
You have to know that Inuit doesn 't ffreeze cold , they exploit .
The packs were sleeping in origins were made of fishes .
The grandfather of this man didn 't have to be at night or from the library of the library that was suffering .
It 's sgatted , she calculated the peeer pints and defecated in your hand . When they made it up in their hand . When they made them up , they made them up , they 're working creating the moama .
It spring up on this sheep , and when it became solid , and when it became solid , he killed a dog .
It took a gave of a glass , and he made a brilliant cass , he made a sleep , and he imbriefly spread on the bagags , he 's a bunch , hit in the remain ,
We want to talk about cavarself-with nothing ? [ Raunted ] . And this , in different ways , Applausi is the symbol of the resilience of the Inuit and all the indigenous popular popular people in the world .
In the april 1999 , the Canadian government redded to the total control of an area of the bigger territory of California and Texas we put together .
It 's their new potential . It 's called Nunut .
It 's a territory . They complished all the minerarial resources .
One of the splendidated as a natione-state can recognize with his popular .
And , to finally , I think it 's quite obvious to who of us was in these remote song of the planet , to make it not be remote to be remote .
For someone is home .
They represent sexual human imagination that are rising to the stuff of the templates . And for all of these children , as the dreams of these children , become part of the geography of hope .
Finally , we 're in National Geographic , we are convinced that politicians will never come to nothing .
We believe that the polemies --
[ Applausi ] they 're not persuasive , but we believe that stories can change the world , and maybe we 're the best institution to tell the stories of the world . Every month of our website has 35 million visit visit visit .
156 countries transmit our television channel .
Our magazines are being labs for millions .
Our work is travel to travel into the etnosphere to bring our audience of cultural wonderful cultural , which will go out of how they have seen and , hopefully , abbracked sometimes the central reveal reveal of the central anthropology : the world to existed , and we have to find a lifestyle of life in a world of plural and multicultural style of life in a world 's plural and multicultural and multicultural and multicultural ,
where the wisdom of all the population can contribute to our collective well-being collective well-being .
Thank you .
I 'm going to talk about some things I wrote in this book I hope I 'm going to talk about other than you 've heard and try to prove some connections , in case you don 't notice them .
I 'd like to start with what I call " the " official dogma official . "
Dogma 's official dogma ?
The official dogma of all the Western industrial Western society 's reciental dogma : " If we want to maximum our citizens . " " " The way to do it is maximum individual freedom . "
The reason is , from one side , in fact that freedom is in itself a value , is a value , is uful , useful , essential for human beings .
On the other is that if we are free , each of us can act to do it for the whole thing that massive to do everything that massive well-being , without no one that decides .
The way to massimilar freedom is massive to choice .
More choices are more than choices , and more are free , and more , the freedom is their well-being .
This , I think , it 's so deeply radicated in society that nobody would dreams to put it in the doubt .
And it 's also deeply radicated in our lives .
I 'm going to show you some examples of what made as progress as possible .
This is my supermarket . It 's not particularly big .
I lost a simple note on the minds of saved saved .
In my supermarket , there are 175 conditions , without content ent ent oil extraves that you can buy for the 12-path and 12 acet-friends you you can buy to you a huge number of conditions in the incbreaking circumstance that nobody of 175 people ready is of your degree .
That 's how the supermarket .
Then you go to the walk to the stereo , you know , CD lector , radio , plahand , piahand , the practice , the amplificator .
And in this individual store , there 's a lot of audio components .
We can make six million and a half a different combinations using the components that there are only one store .
You need to admit that there 's lots of choice .
Other fields : the world of communications .
Once , when I was a child , you could get all the desire phone services , to pat the deep phone that were fornites that were fornites from mama Bell .
It was going to lead the phone , you didn 't buy it .
A consequence of that , by the way , was that the telephone never break .
These days are gone .
Now we have a variety of telephones , especially between cellular cellular mobile .
Here 's the future cell phones .
My favorite is in the middle , MP3 , cuts , cuts of the blood , and properties for the brulthele me .
If you don 't have yet seen it in the store under home store , you 're well going to get .
And what happens is that people come in in the stops and ask this question . And you know what 's the answer ? The answer is " No . "
It 's not possible to buy a cell phone that not face too many things .
So , in other aspects of life that are much more important than the aquers , you have the same same thing explosion of choices .
Assistence health : no longer happens in the United States that you go from the doctor and say , you have to do .
Instead , you go to the doctor and the doctor says , " OK , we could do A , or B , " has these benefits and risks , " Brom has these benefits and risks . What do you want to do ? "
You say , " Dottor , what should I do ? "
And the doctor says , " A has these benefits and risks , and you have these benefits and risks . "
" What do you want to do ? "
And you say , " Wook if she was me , what would you do ? "
And the doctor : " But I 'm not . "
We call it a malate " malate " , " expression that makes it seem like a nice thing .
But , actually , it 's not that a weight and responsibility to decisions from someone who knows something , which is the doctor , to someone else you don 't know -- and it 's certainly malated -- and so sically , it 's not a malated patient -- and so in the condition to make the patient .
There 's a huge marketing of products , direct drurug to people like me and you , that if you think you don 't have any sense , because you can 't buy them .
But if we can 't buy them , why do you have a public ?
The answer is that they want you to call it a domesting for us to recipe .
And something of that 's fundamental as our identity is ornever is a question of choice , how you see in this jail . " We don 't want to prove children . We 're going to provide their sex at time . " We don 't recognize their own time . " We have to invent .
And we can reinventing how many times we do it .
which means that every morning , at the risk , you have to decide that kind of person you want to be .
I think about the family and marriage , a time perspective , a time perspective , was almost almost for anyone , was that it was marriage to the most price possible , and it was to get the most earliest possible .
The only real choice was with who , not when , and even what to do after .
That 's really what it 's really to play .
I teach students very smart students , and I do 20 percent in less than a time .
And it 's not because they 're brilliant , not because they 're less diligent .
but why I 'm impensive , intent to ask , " Would I be married or not ? Would I have to do it now ? "
" Would I have to married later ? I have to think before I got children or career ? "
They 're interrogatives logatives .
And they try to answer these questions , even if this implesson not to do the compies that I 'm asking and not to get a good vote to my examples .
And they really have to do it . They 're important questions .
Now , the work : we are lucky , like Carl , because technology allows us to work , every day , every day , from every day , from every day , from every day , from every day Hotel Randolph .
I 'm talking about , there 's a corner , and I won 't tell anybody , where the WiFi works .
I don 't tell you , because I want to use it .
What does this mean , this incredible to choice that we have about work ? It 's that we have to be decide , continuously , if we have to work or not .
We can go to our son playing hot , with cell phone in a pocket , the Blackberry in the other , and the news , typically , on the knees .
And even if they 're all spent , every minute we see our child ruining the game , we 're also asking , " I 'm also asking this called ? "
" Did you answer this to this email ? I have to embrace this letter ? "
And even when the answer is " no , " all this makes the experience of your son 's game of your son 's game , very different than what it would be in other conditions .
So , from any part of the look , little and big , big , materials and big things , materials and life is a question of choices .
Once the world was this : Of , there was some possibilities , but it wasn 't a question of choice .
The world of today looks like this : The dilemma is : " Is it a positive , or negative ? "
The answer is Same answer is .
The positions we all know them , so I 'm going to talk about the negatives .
And this is a choice of two effects of negative effects on people .
The first , paraladoxically , is that it makes a paralysis that it makes a liberation .
With a lot of options between which choices , becomes very difficult to do it .
I give you an example : a conduct study on the plans of volunteden .
A conneck to have access to the Vanguard data , the gigantic society data , with about a million clients in 2,000 different companies .
What she discovered is that for every 10 solutions that are actually offered in more , the percentage of two percent .
With 50 to offer a fource , 10 percent in less than adesions than when they 're available to only five . Why ?
Because with 50 fources between them , is sick , it 's sick , it 's very difficult to decide , and choice is remajor to tomormormorrow .
And to ask tomorrow , and ask tomorrow , tomorrow , and tomorrow , and of course , never comes .
Capes that not just means that these workers are going to send dogs because they don 't have enough money , they want to say that decision is so hostical that lose the decision is so hostical source of the workers .
They 're not participating , they 're losing to five thousand dollars for the dator of work , which would be very much to be disposed to .
So , the paralysis a consequence of having too many choices .
And I think it makes the world like this .
" And finally , " Would the laster , " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " "
You 'd like to take the right decision , if it 's for ethnity , is it ?
You don 't want to choose the wrong fund , and you don 't even the wrong condition .
So , this is the first effect . The second is that even if we can get a paralysis and make a choice , we end , we 're less emphasize of how we would have been with less opens by the result of which choosing .
And this is a different thing .
One of these is that with many of them , you know , if you buy one , if you buy one and it 's not perfect , it 's easy to imagine that you could have a different choice that would have been better . And what happens is that the alternative imagined us to reammark us to be a choice , and the reflect of choice , and the return the return the suddisfenheding the soddisfreshers the decision that you would have been better .
And when it was a good decision .
More choices , it 's more pleasant than any detail that is insodatic is insodatic option of choice .
And also , there is what economists call expensive opportunities .
Dan Gilbert asked has asked a very well stamattine like the value we give things things to depends on what we compare them .
And the rest , when there 's lots of options , it 's easy to represent features of alternative untareas of option that you have to be less submitted by option that you have to be less submitted .
Here 's an example . I 'm schools with all of the people who are not New York .
But that 's what you probably think of .
There 's this couple to the Hamptons .
A lussian lver place .
It 's all about splendida . It 's all about them .
It 's nothing . But what he thinks is , " Well , the buildings , it 's Agotten . "
" All my neighbors in Manhattan are way . "
" I could talk about it is just in front of home . "
And it goes two weeks and assillated by the idea that 's losing -- every day -- the possibilities of parking where it wants .
The expensive opportunity decrease the sudisfensued what we have , even when the choice was excellent .
And the most are the options we have to consider , the more of the accountable to how to cost cost cost cost .
Here 's another example .
This is telling us a lot of things .
It 's about living time , and maybe living slowly .
But the most important point is that you 're chok , you don 't do other .
The things that we don 't choose to be a lot of attractive that can make less active what we do .
Third point : spiral growing of expectations .
I tried it on my skin buying a new jeans .
I 'll almost always jeans .
Once the jeans were just one , you were just like , buy them and sleep as they were strooted , only after having a life and work a lot of times , they started to go .
So I went to buy a couple when the old people went , and I said , " I need a couple of jeans , this is my cutting cutting . "
The committed me said , " Lake want to be , " Are you , the fit ? "
Do you want them to have them with the cernieer or the buttons ? " Stoneet ? "
" Would you like to do it ? "
" Wote they want to walk up ? Billly bluster -- " Continuated to elencounter .
I was sbalord , and after a while I was able to say , " I want to say , " I want to say , " I want to say , " You know all of maledites , and I tried to all these things , and then I 'm using the best jeans , and I would get out of the store , I would have ever had .
It was the maximum . With all that I had the best .
But I felt worse .
Why ? I wrote a whole book to understand it .
The reason I was worst is that with all that choice my expectations were very high , jeans had to be perfect .
I was going to have expectations that I didn 't expect to nothing about exceptional when it was 100 different , steps , but when I saw 100 different steps , steps , at least one had to be perfect .
What I was buy was good , but not perfect .
After I had a compared to what I was trying to do , I was unsatisfied in comparison .
The added of options in the life of people don 't do that increase the expectations that have been respected to the options themselves .
And this is going to try to disfall , even when the results are good .
Nobody in the world of marketing , if you realize .
Because if they knew , you wouldn 't know what I 'm talking about .
The truth looks more like this .
" It was better when it was worst . " The reason he was better when it was worst when it was worst , when it was worst yet possible to meet surprised pleasure of the pleasure of evolution .
Over the world , in the world we live in -- opulent , industry with the expectancy of the expection of -- the maximum that we can hope is that things are in the altitution of expectations .
You never have surprised because your expectations , my expectations , my expectations , they 're ingigantic .
The secret of happiness -- what you 're here -- is , " Baxis , " Yes , you want . "
I mean , a little bit of a car -- which I really have married and my wife is really wonderful .
I couldn 't have done , I couldn 't do it .
But it 's not always account is a bad thing .
Finally , a consequence of buy a couple of jeans when there 's just that jeans is that when you 're not satifacts , and you " Why ? "
" Who is responsible ? " , the answer is clear .
The world is responsible . What can I do with it ?
When there are hundreds of jeans , and you buy a insudatisfacing , and ask you who is the responsible , it 's the responsible , it 's the responsible you .
You could have done better .
With hundreds of varieties available , there are not excuse for insuccess .
So when people are taking decisions , even if the result is valid , they feel dismade you and they 're going to give the hame to them .
In the last years , the depression is exploded in the industry .
I think that a factor -- not the only , but important -- of this wave of depression is that people have deluating a delurecent experiences because the standard are too high .
And when they have to explain this situation , they think that they 're their colpe .
So the final result is that we 're in general , objectively , but we feel worse .
Let me remember you .
This is the official dogma , what we all take for good and it 's completely fake . It 's not true .
There 's no doubt that a little bit of choice is better than to have it , but it 's not a lot of choice , but it doesn 't have a lot of choice .
There 's a critical value , I don 't know what it is .
But I 'm sure we 've overcome by by a piece of level where choices are improved by a piece of life .
Now , from the political point of view -- I 've almost finished -- from the political point of view , the pel 's pel is the following .
What it allows all this choice in the industrial society is the wealth .
There are many places in the world , and you know , the problem is not that they have to do it is not that they have to have a choice .
The problem is they have too pop .
So the factor I 'm talking about is a malbeing exclusive to modern , rich society , Western society .
And what it does depress and climbing is this : Steve Levitt , talked about how expensive and discoseats to be unuseful . It 's a sprecognizes . It 's a sprec sprec of money .
I mean , this is a complicated and available , it 's not that they 're just unuseful .
I 'm actually deleteries .
They 're going to be worse .
If you have a little bit of what in our society was reversed in those where people have too much possibilities , they don 't just have their life to improve but our life also .
This is what economists call a paretian improvement improvement .
A redistribution is good to all the time -- not only to poor -- because of this choice in excess that we 're going to come back .
And I 'll end up , " You can become everything you want " --
You , people in culture , you 'll think , " What does it believe that fish ? "
" It 's obvious that you can 't make anything in a window . "
" A castrated vision , a limited view of the world --
and I 'm interpreted this so , at the beginning .
But then , I think , instead , I realized that that the fish knows longer .
Because the fact of the fact is that if you miss in frantum , so that it 's not as you can 't get the freedom . You get the paralysis .
If you break the bottom so that all of decreases you can decrease satifation .
You get the paralysis , and you reducing welling wells .
They all need a sphere .
This is almost certainly too closely , perhaps even for the fish , and certainly for us .
But the absence of some symbolic symboard is a recipe for infeless , I 'm afraid of a druine .
Thank you very much .
