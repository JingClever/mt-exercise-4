I showed these these slides to show that the sound calotter , which is so much three million years had the size of the artical artical , which is remarkable to the United States , it 's restretched 40 percent .
But this subvaluable , the gravity of the problem because it doesn 't show the spessor of the ice .
The artical caloth calculation is , in a sense , the clear heart of the global climate system .
You go to the winter and you get extreme of the winter .
The next slide is going to be a quick carrelated to the advestiments of the last 25 years .
The glaces are red in red in the red .
You see , they 're going to go to the blue wall .
That 's the ice in the winter , which is ritired of extreme .
You can see that the cosidn ice , of five years or more , is like blood , which is like blood , which is like blood , which is like blood , which is like blood , which is like blood , which is like blood , which is like blood , which is like blood , and you can see that the cosidn .
In 25 years , it 's been done .
This is a problem because the heat interest in the land around the the world of the arctic ocean where there are huge amounts of carbon congle , where there are huge amounts of carbon dium that , they have transformed in metane .
It turns out to the totality of the atmosphurs from global warming , that amount of global warming , could doubled , overcome this point of not return around .
In some laghi , a little profound in Alaska is already rebolling from water .
The professorate professor Katey Walter of the University of Alaska team in the pressure of a team of the last last inverse .
Video : Wow ! Al Gore : You 're going to be good .
One reason that is that this termal scratats the Groenland from the northern .
This is a pyyaccount of glacial .
The landed was never reached to levels them .
This is the Kangerlussuaq , in the sought of Groenland .
If you want to know how the snice the level of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice .
These currents are increasing .
Another part of the planet : Antarctaught of the planet .
The last month of the scientists have dikey that the bills of ice is in the negative ice is in the negative , and that the Antarctards on some islands , is particularly faster in the leaving of the sun .
It 's six feet of the level of the level of the acque , like in Groenland .
The Himalaya , the third larger block of ice , you see new laghi , which few years ago , they were glaciers .
40 percent of the world population will be half of the water that 's the potail .
Sulle Ande : this glacier is the fount of the water source of this city .
The landed is increased .
But when it diminuds , the same happens to the water .
In California , the nenow on Sierra Nevada is diminished 40 percent .
The idricrics are in crisis .
The predictions , as you read , they 're good .
The growing sses in the world leads to a remarkable increases .
The environmental disaster disaster , and it without precedented .
Four times more numeroes in the last 30 years , I 've got 75 .
This is a very unsustainable .
If you look at the context of the historical consequences .
In the last five years we 've added 70 million tons of CO2 every 24 hours -- 25 million tons in the ocean every day .
Look at the same same as the Eastern area , from the Americas , to the west , and in both of the subcontinent parts of the subcontinent , where there is a radical impoverth in the ocean .
The greater cause of global warming , together , and the deforestation , which is 20 percent , is the fossil fuel use .
The oil is a problem , and the carbon is even worse .
The United States are one of the two countries with more emissions , together to China .
And he was proposing to build a lot of other carbon that .
But we 're seeing a direction changing .
These are the anullated projects in the last few years and some green propointing green propots .
Every way , there 's a political lobe in our country .
The carbon industry and oil have spent 250 million dollars in the last year to promoting carbon , which is a oxyggoll .
That 's what I 'd like to do is --
Natal , Tennessee , where I live , there was a 3.8 billion powers of a 3.8 billion of the fast carbon .
Maybe you 've seen about the news .
This is the second largest second flow of last flow in America .
It 's happened around Natale .
The puzzle advity of one of the carbon industry was this .
Video : Swear the carbon is a kind of allegro and happy .
It 's abundant here in America , and it 's going to grow our economy .
Frosty carbon is more and more and more .
It 's good price , adorable and the work of the maintain .
Al Gore : Froginia is a lot of the West Virginia .
The greatest greatest minerary society is Massey Coal . This is his administrator .
Video : Don Blakenship : I 'm going to have to have a little bit of the Gore Peloid Reid -- they don 't know what they 're talking about .
Al Gore : So the Alleance for the Protexture of Clima has two campaigness .
This is a part of them , a part .
Video : Attore COALergy : ALergy , as a serious serious serious sweet in our business .
So , our priority is investing a great amount of money in a effort to make public and confused the truth of the real real of the carbon .
In fact , carbon is not sports .
We think it 's clean -- it 's also a good profugee .
So , not preocupots of climate change .
Let me do it .
Video : Carbone pulit : Carbone , you heard very much .
So let 's do with a structure to look around in a structure to the avaning of the pulit .
Straordinary ! The machines are a little rumous , but this is the sound of the pulit technology .
The carbon consumption is between the main of global warming , but the remarkable of global warming , but the technology of the pullit that you see everything .
You look at a look : this is the odiergn technology .
Al Gore : Inally , the alternative alternative , the positive , and the national security .
Video : How about America is in crisis ; the economy , the national security crisis .
The flights all : our dependence of our dependence , as the pumbable fuel , as the sports fuel and oil for the importantly oil .
Now , there 's a new , audace , increasing solution for the circuit .
Repower : 100 percent of clean energy , in 10 years .
A to remain America to work , make sure , and make sure , and help to stop the global warming .
Finally , a solution that basts to solve our problems .
Repower . Scover more .
Al Gore : This is the last last .
Video : How about it : It 's about return to America .
One of the fastest ways of to ask , to dependence from combustible combustible that kills our planet .
Comparse : The future is here . Vent , a new energy network .
Comparse : Nuoves investment for a good jobs .
Comment : Repower America . It 's time to be realistic .
Al Gore : A old proverbio is , " If you want to go fast , you go to fast .
If you want to go away , you go together . "
We have to go away , quickly .
Thank you very much .
Last year at TED , I 've got a introduction on the LHC .
And promise to come back to enjoy on how the machine works .
So there me . And for me that the other time there were no , the LHC is the greatest scientific experiment -- ever , 27 kilometers of circuit .
His task is to recognize the conditions that were at less than a billion to the universe -- until 600 million million times a second .
All that is just environmentally unchanging .
This is the Ginevra .
We 're going to have these min-Big Bang inside the detectors .
This is what I work . It 's called ATLAS -- is about 44 feet and has a diameter diameter of 22 feet .
This is a spectacular picture of ATLAS in building this so you can see proportions .
To 10 wettember of last year , we have the car for the first time .
And this picture was taken from ATLAS .
It was because of immenis festeggiving in the control .
It 's an image of the first particle that had done all the LHC , entking in collision , by entering in collision , with a part of the HC , and spread particle into the relevant .
In other words , when we see that picture of the 10 sets , we realize that the machine worked , which is a great wittory .
I don 't know if this is this to do , or that , when somebody went to Google and saw that the page is that this is .
That means we have a cultural impact over to the scientific impact .
About a week later , there was a problem with the machine , and it was just to these file files here -- these files .
These files are going to have this to 3,000 printed when the machine works .
Now , the technical technical between you will look at the file , and they say , " It 's not true . I 'm too overcome too . "
And they can do it because when they 're very cosiddles are very cosiddles .
So , at least 271 degrees , at least 271 degrees , these things can bring that death the space between the stars , these files can bring that deal .
In one of the giuntures of the most noticing magneti in the LHC , there was a fect of fabrication .
So the file files are going to get slightly , and the 13,000 prints , they had a electrical resistance .
This was the result .
Now , this is more impressive if you think that these magneti fish that these weighs more than 20 tons , and that have moved about 30 centimeters .
They are about about 50 magneti magneti .
We had to take them , what we did .
We 've been restinated and upset .
They 're going to return all to their place place .
By the end of the LHC is going to be integrated .
We 'll access it , and we expect to get data , and we expect to get data , and we continue so our adventure to discover what the morons that are the morons that are the morons that are the morons that are the morning that universe .
Now , of course , of course , these accidents return the dible debate on the value of science and engineering in front of science and engineering in front .
I think the fact that it 's so hard , the fact that it 's so hard to be that the value of things like LHC .
I want to end with the words of a English scientist , Humphrey , the Spet , the way , I imagine , in dify of inuseful experiments of his pupille , his pupille Faraday , he said , " Nist , as much dangerous as the revers of science as the human mind as defines , which not there are no way to be new . "
Thank you .
I want to start asking you to start thinking about when , as a kids , play with the morning ning .
As you can get them and deal as you reach and get them , and you 're going to be able to think and solve them , and you can actually think and solve them and conservatial relationship .
The space reasoning is deeply connected to the way we understand a way we understand a part of the world around us .
So , from the inspired information use of our interaction with physical objects , together to my physical consulent of my own Pack-CElabor , and my collaborator Jeevan Kalanithi , I started to have the only mouse as a computer , but we have the only mouse as a polly-pastrat a described of mouse , we could trust a sweet with an information with both hands , we could trust , with an information with both of your hand ,
and how do it to our please ?
The question was so interesting that we decided to explore the answer , building Siftable .
In a few words , a Siftable computer is a great interactive .
In a few words , a Siftable computer is a great interactive .
You can move with the hand , they can move with their hand , they can see their movement and they have a screen and a radio wireless .
But most of course , are physicians , as the morning , you can move it simply .
The Siftable is an example of a new ecosystem to manipulate the digital information .
And as they become more physicians , knows of the movement , and as they become more physicians , and as they become more physicians , and other , of how we can do them , we can explore new and different styles of interaction .
I 'm going to start with some simple example .
This Siftable is configurate to show the video : if you 're going to put the video . And the video is going to stay on the other side .
These interactive rates are conscious about other people .
If you face them , they 're interested in what they 're going to do .
If they are circuit , they can see it and they can make a little bit .
If they are circuit , they can see it and they can make a little bit .
They also have their movement and inclination .
We then realized that one of the interestaningly interaction was able to use common management agement , to example , " a color like if it was a liquid .
In this case , we have three Siftable configurate as a truth , and I can use them to the color in that central , where you 're missed .
and I can use them to the color in that central , where you 're missing .
If we 're too too much , we can put a little place .
I 'm also good possibilities of apprentice , like language , the mathematics , which is mathematics and logames where people can try things , and see it immediately .
Now , I 'm going to --
This is a Fibonaccount that I do with a equations of equations .
Here we have a words that is in half between the Scarabeo and Boboble .
Pratically , at every Siftable , at every Siftable , Pratically , at every Siftable , Pratically , at every Siftable , and as you 're cerks to get to a dictionary .
Then , after about 30 seconds , they remissed , and you have a new leck of reading and new possibilities to try .
Thank you .
Here 's what kids came to the finite Media Lab , I did so that I tried them and I got a video .
They are very pleasure .
And one of the interesting things that kind of applization is that you don 't have to give people a lot of education .
You 've got to say , " Compons of words , and they know exactly what to do .
Here , other people who are going to try .
This is our becoming in the most young , there on the right .
It was actually going to impilling them .
They only were morning , for him .
Now , this is a appliation of a interactive chartone .
We wanted to build a tool for the language of the Lui is Felix .
It can put new characters in the scene , and you can get their own associated .
It can put new characters in the scene , and you can get their own associated .
Here , it 's doing the sun .
Video : The sun is source .
David Merrill : Now she 's a treat the scene .
Video : The treat the same time .
Bel work ! Yeah !
So , eight by the Siftable and put closer can make characters --
Video : Bau !
-- by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by by
Video : Hi !
DM : It 's a story with the open , and it can decide how you want .
DM : It 's a story with the open , and it can decide how you want .
Video : Vola on , thin ,
DM : The last example I have time to show you is a device , realized of recent , to campaign and execguire music .
It 's a instrument , realized that it 's a tool , to campaign and to make music .
The Siftable here are act from the bottom , and the bacteria .
Each of these has four different variations , and you can choose what to use .
And then you can also put these sound in a sequence to you to get your please .
And it 's just to do touch a sound and a sequence . "
These are actually actually that you can control from the vial , like the reverber and the filtrum .
It 's a particular sound , and then you cut to enjoy it .
And then there are the general effects like time and volume , that they 're applied to the sequence .
Let 's look at how it works .
Video : We 're going to build a basic base in the Siftable , " sequence , " We 're going to put it in a series , we add the other base .
Now I put a basis of the bottom line .
Video : DM : Now , I add percussions --
Video : And now I 'm going to put the filter to the bacteria , so I can control the effect from the vial of the world .
Video : DM : Can the internation sequence of the intery of the time , or .
Video : I 'm going to add the full filter to make more expression .
Video : DM : Can you can recombine the sequence of the flight . "
So I don 't have to do that before , but I can improvisate , make it longer or the corner .
And now , finally , I can spend the whole sequence of the Britritish Brittable on the left Siftable .
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is to build new mo-machine interfaces as our brain work and body .
And today , I 've had time to show you one of the result of this path , and also some possibility that we try to bring out of the lab .
The concept I want to get to you is that 's coming up this new generation of objects to interact with digital media , which will bring information in our world of the way we want .
Thank you very much .
I don 't see the now of talk to all of you .
I 'm a writer .
I 'm going to be books is the profession , of course .
It 's also love and the fascination of my life .
And I don 't expect that it can change .
But , this is something particular happened to my life , and in my career , which has brought me to report my entire life , which has brought me to report my interior with this work .
The particular thing is that I 've recently written this book , this biography called " Mangia , Prega , " which is diversely from my books , and it became a great , bestylian , bestler , bestler , bestylit , and the great interational ,
And the result is that everywhere is now , people tretreated me as if I were convicted .
It 's true -- convicvictims .
They 're going to be all worried and say , " Don 't you fear to do ?
You don 't fear to continue to write for all of life without being able to create a book that can be able to create a book that can be able to be able to create a book that can be able to be able to be able to be able to create a book that can 't be able to be able to create a book that can 't be able to create a book that can 't be able to create a book that 's going to be able to create a book that can 't be able to be able to create a
that can be importance to somebody ? "
It 's uncercertainly , you know .
But it could go worse , at the end of the one I remember that more than 20 years ago , when I started to say , I was an adolescent -- I wanted to be a writer .
I was going to put the same reaction , the same reaction .
And people said , " Don 't I have to have success to me ?
Don 't you fear that the laws of the refabled you ?
Don 't you fear to do this to mestize for all of life without anything about it 's ever there and dead to a cue of dreams with the pile of advocation of failure ? "
So , you know .
The answer -- the short answer to all these questions is , " Yes . "
I 've got all these things .
I always had fear .
And I also fear of a lot of other things that people can 't have to indeed .
As the algae and other spaving things .
But , as as much about it , and I 'd like to say , and I 'd like to say , "
Is it rational ?
It 's logical that anyone has to be spended by a job that 's a job that 's been born to do .
But what 's so particular in the impressive creative , and it 's about it to be nervable to the mental health of the other people in a way that other people do not do ?
How my father , for example , he was a chemical engineer and I don 't remember one time in his 40 years of activity in which the fear to be engineer ?
Not there was ever -- that blolock of the John , how does it go ?
Don 't that that , do you know ?
Onestly , the chemicals like group have not certainly , in the centuries , guadagned the reputation of being alcolized maniacates .
We 've been writers , we have enough this reputation , and not just writers , but creative of any kind of -- we have this reputation of being huge instainable .
And it 's not about the other than you look at the sad of the magnifications of the magniftape of the magnifments of the magnify century , they die young people and often .
And even the ones that you don 't have been suicidata to be really disfacing from their dunds .
Norman Mailer , before he died , in the last interview said , " Every little more " an extraordinary affermonstration about the work of their life .
But we don 't do it , when we heard these things so much long that in some way we 've been completely interiorized and accepted the notion that creativity and the art , and the art , and the art , to get to some way and that art , at the end , it will always containing the angosciousness .
And the question I want to ask everybody today is : you agree with this idea ?
You know this thing -- because it 's looking at a centimeter of distance to me , it 's not good for this supposition .
I think it 's odious .
And I think it 's dangerous , and I don 't want to see the perpetuated in the next century .
I think it 's better to encourage our big minds to live .
And I certainly know , in my case -- in my situation -- it would be very dangerous to start fuse to that I 'm sure that I know about supposed to be able to start with circumstances that are in my career .
Ovtrue -- I 'm going to look at , I 'm pretty young , I 've got about 40 years .
I 've got about four work decades of work in me .
And it 's very likely that everything I 'm going to be right now right now , it 's going to be judged after the world 's workplace to my last book .
I 'm going to be slavery , because we 're all more or less friends here -- it 's likely that my big success is to my shoulder .
Oh , Gesus , who thought !
You know this is the kind of thinking that leads a person to start to start to beat the nine of the morning and I don 't want to do it .
I would like to continue to do this work that we 're going to do this work that we 're .
So , the question is the question , how ?
And so I think , after a lot of reflective , that the way to work to continue to write is to create a psychologic psychologic , right ?
I have somehow to find a distance of security between me , that I 'm writing , and my natural anxiety that is going to be going to be able to get it . And , as I was trying to do it to look through the time , trying to find other society to see if they could have better ideas and more healthy and more healthy ideas to see if they could have have the best ideas and more healthy ideas and more sane .
as to help people managing to managing the inerent people of creativity .
And that research has taken me to the Greek and old Rome .
Seguitegen me because I 'm going to go back .
In the Greek Greek and the ancient Rome -- the people didn 't seem to believe that creativity was in men , OK ?
It was thinking that creativity was this spirit , and that they were in the men from a few people distant , and unknown , for the distances and unknown , for distances and unknown , for distances .
The greatest great-spirites were called these creativity demonons .
Sock , wonderful , wonderful , he created to have a demon elargloves from away away .
Roands were the same idea , but they called the the kind of spirit without a genium .
which is great , because Roands didn 't think that a genius was a very smart genius was a very smart .
They think that a genius was this kind of divine that was living in the muri of an artist , a little bit like the elpho Dobby , and that they were out of the eleventually as the else-up of the artist work of the work of the artist and models the result of that the work .
Here is the distance of -- here is the distance of which is the distance of which is the psychologist that protects you protects of your work .
And everybody knew that was so that it worked , right ?
So the anti-artists were protected to certain things , like , for example , the way too much black-sm artists , right ?
If your work was exceptional , you could not take everything everything , you know that the wirst , everybody knew that the wirst of this incorporate genius .
If your work work failed , it wasn 't all of your work , right ?
Everybody knew that it was your genius to be a incapable .
And so people han conceived creativity in Occcutting for a long time .
Then the Rinasure Rinasure came and everything , and they had this big idea ; we put the human being in the center of the universe over the universe and the mysteries and without any of leave space creatures that writing from divinity .
This was the principle of humanth rational principle and people started thinking that creativity was completely from the issue .
And for the first time in history , you start to refly to this or that artist as a genius , as a genius , as a genius of the genius .
And I have to say , I think that was a big mistake .
I think that allow somebody , a simple person of thinking about as a recipient as a recipient source , the essence and the source of all the mysteries , creativity , and unknown as a very big physical physical to give the human psychology .
It 's like to ask someone to enjoy the sun .
Deform and destores that I think and all these inexible ingestishing the performance .
And I think it was this pressure that you 've been destructed in the middle of the styypaired artists in the spent of the artists in the spent in in the past .
And , if this is true , and I think that is , and I think that is , and now ?
Can we do that diversity ?
Maybe I 'll come back to a more antical comprement of the relationship between human relationship between human relationship and mystery creative .
Or maybe not .
Maybe we can 't have 500 years of rational thinking in a 18 minutes .
And there is probably people between the public that would be legitimate sosports of scientific , I mean , they do that they follow people in the next factories , they do that .
I 'm probably not going to convince you all about this thing .
But the question I 'd like to ask is -- why not ?
Why would you not think that in this way ?
because it 's more sense of everything that has ever heard to explain the explanation of the creative process of creative process .
One process that , as anybody who ever tried to do something -- so , so , all here -- you don 't have to do something -- so that you don 't compories .
And , in fact , it can sometimes be completely paranormed .
I did this inagainst recently with the extraordinary poetry Ruth Stone , who has now 90s , but that was a poeter for the whole life and said that during his infants in the rural Virginia , working out there , and he felt , inside of if a poetry , when a poem was in the landscape , and he had to feel , in the way , when a poem .
He said that it was like a frageous train of the air .
And he was rottolling to her from the landscape .
He felt that to get , because he was going to to try to get the land under his feet .
He knew I had one thing to do to do that point and it was of , words , " run as a matta . "
And he 's going to correct home and it was sitting from this poem , and it wouldn 't have to get a piece of paper and a pencil of a fast , and a pencil of fast , and the rate it on the page .
Sometimes I couldn 't be fast enough , so it 's fast , so it 's going to get in home and the poem , and the poem the rotolated through and she would continue to rotolate through the landscape , trying to break through the landscape , looking for , as she said , " another poet . "
Then there were those times -- this piece of the piece I 'm going to say -- there were some moments where the was almost losing , OK , OK ?
So , he was running home and she was trying to get the card and the poem was looking through , and then he said a pencil right in the way that was going to go , and then said , which was like if you 're sat with the other hand and the office .
He was the poem of the poetry from the coda and he had to the page .
And in these cases , the poem would be presented on the perfect page , and the last word to contrary , and the last word to the first .
So when I felt thinking -- it 's crazy , it 's exactly the same same as my creative process .
Not all my creative process -- I 'm not a convicted .
I 'm a mule , and my way to work is ; you know , you know , I 'm going to see the horary every day and work and I 'm going to get up there .
But even I , in my testotic testing , I 've been strippaying that thing , sometimes .
And I think that many of you the han .
You know , even though the work and ideas came to me from a certain certain source , you can 't know , windows .
And what this is this thing ?
And how can we relate to it in a way that we don 't lose your head , but , rather , what do we do that ?
So , for me , the best example of the best example I have is the musician Tom Waits , which I 've been different years ago for a day .
We were talking about this , and you know , Tom , for the majority of life is the incarnation of the artist tomented in the contemporary of the inforeo , to try to control , dominate these species of impults .
But then I 'm going to get cut , and a day , and a day while he was driving on a highway in Los Angeles , changed everything for him .
He was going to fast and everything of a tract with this little framment of melodia , which comes in in his head as the inspiration , and the well-hallettant , and the wants , you know , it 's wonderful , and the desidst , but it doesn 't know how to take it .
It 's not a piece of paper , it 's not a math , it 's not a math registrator .
So , I started to hear this kind of old old old old , " I 'm going to lose , and I 'm going to lose , and I 'm going to remarried by this song .
I 'm not good enough and I can 't do that . "
And instead of going to go in the panic , and he stopped .
He was going to be a whole new thing .
I just just just the sky and said , " Scuses , you don 't see that I 'm going to do ? "
" Would it seem to write a song right now ?
If you really want to exist , you get a bit more opporting , when I can take care of you .
Again , you go to importunate somebody else today .
I got to disturbing Leonard Cohen . "
And his process working changed after this .
Not the work , the work , the work was still dark .
But the process , and the fish anxiety that was require when the genius , the genius that 's the genius that he was writing out of him , and freed it back to where , realize that it didn 't have to be a whole thing .
but it 's a conversation between Tom and this is wonderful bizarra collaboration between Tom and this strange and external thing that it was not Tom .
So , as the story that story started to change a little bit even the way I worked and I had already save me .
This idea , I 'm going to saving " Mangia , Prega , Ama , " and I adds in one of those cave of the disperation that we 're all working on something and we can 't do and you can 't do and you start to think that it 's worst .
Not just bad , right , right the worst book wrote .
And I started thinking about giving this project .
But then I remember Tom I was talking about Tom that I was talking about .
So I was alzed my face in the wild and deressed my commitment to a vacuum of the room .
And I said , " Sort , what , " Sort , what we 're going to be brilliant , what 's going to be brilliant , not going to be brilliant , right ?
Because as I see I 'm going to get everything I have , I have , I don 't have this .
So if you want to be better , you have to be presented and do your part .
Okay . But if you don 't do it , you know what , I do , I don 't do that .
I 'm going to write the same because it 's my work .
And I want to please that it was recorded that I 've been presented to do my part , " because -- finally , OK -- I mean , I 'm so , OK -- hundred people in the deserts of the dancing of the dances of the moon , and the sacred and the hand-up and the hour and the hour to the alba .
And they were always magnify , because the ballerins were great .
But every time , I rarely , something happened , and one of these artists had become actually transcendent .
And I know what you 're talking about , because I know you 've all seen , as a perforformance .
It was like if the time , and the ballerine , and the ballerine walked through a kind of land-up , like 1,000 night , as 1,000 you 've got all the time , but everything was all wrote .
And sudden , not just appeared as a human .
But it 's accese from the diinside and the divinity of the divinity .
And when this happened , when this happened , the time , the people knew what it was called him .
They were going to have their hands and began to dotch , " Allah , Allah , God , God , "
That 's God , you know .
With the Spain -- when the More invaded the sououthern Spain , pressure this abitude with them and the pronounced to the centuries , Allah , " " Ole , " which you can still feel in the corries or in the flamp .
In Spain , when a artist did something impossible , and magic , " Allah , the Allah , Allah , " Alah , " By , " incomprensible , that , a last thing of God .
And it 's great because we need .
But , the problem comes the day after , for the ballerine , when you wake and discover that 's the 11-a-and-up morning and the last 11th of the morning and the God is not more .
It 's just a gran bad mortal with gran bad wink , and maybe they can 't do it even more to make that altitude .
And maybe nobody will you have the name of God still as yourself , and what does it have to do with the rest of his life ?
It 's hard .
This is one of the most paorous recognizations to make in a creative life .
But maybe it doesn 't have to be so angoscious if you can 't believe , and it doesn 't believe , and more extraordinary aspects of your being from yourself .
But you think that 's just that you 're data in prested by an inimaginable source of this team of the life that you have to go to somebody else when you finished .
And , you know , if we think that it 's all changes .
And so I started thinking about , and it 's sure as I thought about it for different months during the work of the book that I 'm going to be going to be , the dangerous , spent , attesissued , attesissued , attesissued , and it 's sure ,
And what I have to continue to tell me when I feel I feel that is , it 's not not fear .
It 's not going to be upset .
You can get you to introduce you to your part , any of that you can be .
If your work is balling , you go , you know .
If the divine , absurd on , it 's just a little bit of wonderful , for a few kind of wonderful , for one moment , for one moment , you can just now through your efforts , then " Ole . "
Also , you do the same dance .
And " Ole ! " You know , you 're going to be .
I think , and I think , you have to teach it .
" Ole ! " You know , even for you , even for a human and testoxtal tals to make you continue to make you continue to be .
Thank you .
Thank you .
June Cohen : Ole !
As I 've already talked about some of these projects on the human genome , what can mean and the discovery new set of genes .
Now we 're starting a new path : we started digitalizing biology and now now now we 're coming from that digital code we 're both in a new phase of biology , design and design and synthizing life .
We always tried to ask big questions .
" What is the life ? " That 's something that many biologists I think of flevels .
We tried different approaches , reduced to the minimum .
We 're digitizzing by almost 20 years .
When we sequenced the human genome was treated to go from analome of the world of biology in the digital world .
Now we ask , we can we regenerate life , or to create new life of this digital universe ?
This is the map of a little organism , the Mycoplasm of a little organism between the other than those that can authorem in the lab .
And we tried to reduce the genome of the genome of the genome of them .
We are able to eliminate a hundred genes of genes of about 500 that are here .
But when we look at his metabolic map , it 's relatively simple than our own .
I think that 's simple .
But when we look at all the genes that we can eliminate , one time , it 's very unlikely that this can bring to a living cells .
So we decided that the only way we decided that to be synthize this chromosoma in a way to get the components to bring some of these fundamental questions .
And so we started the adventure of " CCan we can be synthize a chromosoma ? "
Can the chemistry of proud of these big molecules that we never had to create a first right ?
And , in case , we can we make a chromosoma ?
A chromosoma is just a piece of inert material .
The speed we we 're able to digitalize life is growing to rethrow exponential .
Our ability to write genetic code , instead , proproproproproproproproproproproproproproproproproproproproproproproproproproproproproproproproproproproproproproproprocreates , rather slowly , but it 's better .
And our most recent results the results of exponential curve .
We 've been going to have been over 15 years ago .
The process of a lot of passages , starting with a biothetic review before we started the first experiments .
But we found that synthesize DNA is very difficult .
There are tens of thousands of cars in the world that produce small segments of DNA , of the long , of the long , 30 to 50 lettes , and it 's a degenerative process : the most of the segment is long , the more mistakes there are .
So we had to develop a new method to assemble these framments and correcrecrecting the mistakes .
And this was our first attempt , to go from the digital genome of the X 174 .
It 's a little virus that kills bacteria .
We 've been designed by the fragments , effective the rules and get a molecule of a DNA of about 5,000 lettes .
The interesting part is when we took this piece of chemical material , and we put it in the bacteria , the bacteria have started to read this genetic code and viral particle .
The viral particles have then been released by cells , they 've come back and they destruck .
I 've been talking about recent in the oil industry is saying that they 've certainly compresressed this model .
They have more than you .
We think this is a situation where the software can actually actually build his hardware in a biological system .
But we wanted to do things in big .
We wanted to build the entire chromosoma of bacteria .
They 're more than 580 mile mile in the genetic code .
So we thought we 've been building it in the size of the virus , so we can change the cassets of the virus that are the components of a living cells .
The design is crucial , and if we start with digital information in a computer , these must be very accurate .
When we sequenced this genome for the first time in 1995 accuratacy was a mistake for every 10 mile .
We found , resequenced it , 30 mistakes . If we had that original sequence that we never had to do that work .
One part of the process is designing 50 letters that are very long as 50 letters that are subunits that they 're going to have all the other 50 lettes to build subunity smaller than working together .
We 're going to try to the eleventually elements here .
You probably have to read that we insert we put on the filigate .
So , think we have a genetic code on four letters : A , C , GGGs and T.
Three of those letters together , they have a lot of leck , and there 's a specific order of reading for every friend of the letters for every friend .
So we can use the genetic code to write words , thoughts .
What we 've done in the beginning was autographed .
Some of them have been delusers from the fact that it wasn 't poem .
We 've designed these segments to just just just to go with the zyourself .
There are essentially repair them and they put them .
And we started assembling with the parts , starting with segments from five to seven mile , and then you get a segments of 24 mile mile lettes to them to the 72 mile , and they were at the way to get 72 mile .
Every step we product these segments in abdance so that we 're trying to create an extremely robustothing -- as you 'll see in a minute .
We 're trying to self-trying to automatize the process .
So , this seems like the tabellone of the basket .
When we get these very long segments , more than 100 mile , the more than 100 mile , they 're not going to grow in the E.
You get to the limits of modern biology .
So we 've been considered other mechanisms .
We knew about another mechanism called recombination omologa , which in biology is ulizy to repair the DNA to be able to repair the segments .
Here 's an example .
This organism , called Deinococcus radiodurans , it can absorry three million radiation of radiation .
You can see in the sound square like his cromosoma is destructed .
In 12 -- 24 hours comes riassemble as it was before .
There are thousands of organisms that are able to do it .
These organisms can be totally sitting .
They can live under vacuum .
They are absolutely sure that life existing in space , and you feel to find new rich environments of water .
In the true , NASA showed that this is .
This is an image of molecule that we 've built by using these processes , just using the liz-design of appropriate design of the segments of the segments of the segments of the molecule that we 've built by using these processors .
The likely assemble le sauthomatically .
This is not been taken with a microscope with a microscope of electronic microscope .
It 's a very big molecule that we can see the with a little microscope .
These are pictures that they 're going to have about six seconds .
This is the publishing we 've done a little time ago .
They 're more than 580,000 letters of genetic code .
It 's the greatest molecule of a structure that 's ever created by man .
It 's got a lot of molecular soo in 300 million .
If you 're going to pay it with a caratter without spaces , you 'd like to 142 page to transfer this genetic code .
Now , how do do we do it ?
Of course , you trained a virus is a game from kids .
It 's a little bit more complicated when you use of bacteria .
It 's simpler also when it 's about cells as it 's about our cells , you can just extract the nuclear and put it another , which is basically the process of clonation .
In the bacteria chromosoma is integrated inside the cells , but we recently demonstrated that we are able to make a complete complete tradicult chromosoma from one , and to attract it .
We 've got a chromosoma partner-to-partner-to-partner-to-partner-to-partnerships .
The two are different as men from the topes .
We 've got some gene in the way that we can decide what to this chromosoma .
The skid has been sapart in a way to kill all the proteins .
And when we put it in in the cells was study -- and you will appreciate our subfisticated , the new chromosophisticato-- the new chromosophisticatoes came into the cells .
And we began we could not go beyond , but we 've got so much more in there .
This is one of the greatest mechanisms of evolution .
We found that a lot of species have added in a second or a third crumosoma somewhere , add gend in a second thousand traits to the species .
So who think about evolution as one gene , as one gene , it doesn 't understand a lot of of biology .
They 're going to be able to be restripppeculish-up , which is going to be a DNA .
The chromosome that was in the cells not have one .
The cell phula-the chromosoma that we 've got a lot of the one has .
You 've been expressed , and he recognized the other crumosoma , the masticated , and we 've got all all the cells and the new crumosoma .
It became blue because of the genes we 've inserted .
And in a short leverage of time , all the characteristic of a species , you 've got all the way in a new species , based on the new software that we 've inserted in the cells .
All the proteins have changed , the membrane has changed , and when we read the genetic code of the genetic equivalent to what we 've transferred to this .
Now , this might seem alchemy genetic , but altering the software , but we can change things in a sense of basically .
Now , I 've already explained that there is not about genesesis -- but to progress from three million years and a half of evolution , and I said that maybe we 're going to create a new version of Cambriana 's explosion in which will be created new species on this digital process .
Why do that ?
I think it 's pretty obvious when we think about our necessity .
We 're going to go to six billion and a half billion people in the next 40 years .
Just to give an example : I 've been born in 1946 .
Now there are three people on the planet for each existent in 1946 , there 's going to be four years , there will be four .
We 're having problems now to find food , fresh water and clean , medical and well-to-half of people .
It 's going to be more than that we do it for nine billion .
We 're going to use more than five billion carbon , more than 30 billion baries of olizes .
That means a million million baries a day .
When we try to find biological processes , or any kind of process to repair them , it 's going to be a huge challenge .
We have to be more than we have to be recognize the emission of these materials that are going to have in the atmosphere .
In today , because of scientific discovery , because of scientific discovery , we have a database with about 20 million genes , and I like to think that are designed for the future .
The electronics of electronic industry only one dozen of components , and think about how many different things are coming out .
Our limitations here are principles of the biological reality and our imagination .
Now we have techniques , because of these quick metods synthesization , in order to create what we call genomics .
We can build a big robot that is that could produce a million a crumosomes a day .
Think of processing these 20 million genes or to get to get these these things to make a lot of people to make the processes to produce either , new vaccines , and create more biology , and create more biology , now in the last 20 years of science .
And it 's just a standard selection selection .
We can choose to survival for the possibility of survival , chemical production or fuel , production of vacception of vaccepts .
This is an instantanea of some software programmed software that we 're working on to be able to set us and design species in the computer .
Well , we don 't know how they 're going to be .
We know exactly what it is their genetic code .
Now we 're focusing on the fourth of the generation of the way .
You 've seen you that extract from the gran experiment , it was a bad experiment .
We have carburants of second and third generation that they 're going to be like the eighth of higher than the eight-value sorts of butanol .
But the only way the biology can have a great impact without increasing more than increase the cost of food and limitarn the cost of food and limitarne the construction would turn CO2 in matter before , so we 've been working to design cells that can reach to this purpose , and think we can have the first carburants in about 18 months .
The solar light solar light with the CO2 is a metodo-- but in our discovery different metods .
This is a organism we have been described in 1996 .
It 's about 2,000 feet of the deep ocean , about 2,500 feet of the water , in the temperature of water .
They 're using hydrogen molecular as a source of energy .
We 're trying to understand if we can incanalate the CO2 , that can easily be transformed to tramite tubes , converting that CO2 in the carburant , to drive this process .
So , a short pencil we could be able to increase what the basic question of " which is we can be able to increase the whole thing that is . We have the goal of repair the whole goal of repair the whole of chemical oil .
Exxact . If you can 't do that from TED , where you can ?
It would be a main of energy .
And also , we 're working for using the same metods to create vaccines .
You 've seen this year with influence , we 're always back to a year and with a dollar in less when it 's about to find the win ,
I think what you can change is building vaccines in ancient advaccines in anticipate .
Here 's how the future might start to look like changing , now , the tree of evolution , accelerating evolution with the synthetic bacteria , archy , and initially cells .
We are so much from improve people .
Our purpose is to do that that we can live enough to try to do it . Thank you very much .
First of all I 'm going to show , the most rapidly possible , some fundamental work , the new technology that we 've taken Microsoft in a year ago . This is Seadragon .
It 's a environment where you can interact is to local level that you can interact with a huge amount of data visual .
Here we 're seeing a lot of gigabyt-digital picture with a kind of zoom , and it 's a kind of zoom , for a fast , and it 's a little bit of a picture , and you have the images like we want .
And not matter how big it is the amount of information that we see , how big these things are these things that are great data ,
Most are common photographs , but this for example is a scanning from the Library of the Congress of the Congress , and recome into the gama of 300 megaxing .
It doesn 't make any difference because the only thing that the prestations of a system like this is the number of pixels on your screen in any time . It 's also a very flexible architecture .
This is a book , an interior , example of data not images .
This is the Dicket Casa desolate chens .
So , to show you that it 's just about that , and not images , we can do something like that , to actually see that it 's a real real representation of the text , not a picture .
It could be a way artificial artificial to read a electronic book .
Not the advice .
This is an example of the realistic example . It 's a number of the Look .
Every image is the beginning of a sex of the sex .
And it really gives you the pleasure of the pleasure version of a magazine , or a quotidian , which is for nature of a lot of a half .
We also did something with the corner of this number in particular of the Look of this particular number of the Look ,
We 've created a higher advertitional advity -- much more than that you use in a normal advertising advertising .
If you want to see the characteristic of this automobile , you can see here .
Or other models , or even the specific things .
And this really demonstrates some of these ideas to eliminate the space on the screen .
We hope that this means that we 've got to do that , and other porcheries , and other porcheries , you don 't have to be necessary .
Of course , the map is one of the most obviously applications for this kind of technology .
And I don 't want to lose time , if we don 't say that we have contribute to give them in this field .
These are all the streets in the United States in the United States , there 's a geospace-picture picture of NASA .
So now we go to something else .
This is actually actually actually , from the right right right on the web ; you can go to see it .
It 's a project called the Photosynthy , which combine two different technologies .
One is Seadragon and the other is a very interesting visual computer that 's a very interesting visual , a student of the University of Washington , with the aid of Steve Seitz Seitz Rick Szeliski Szeliski Rick . " At a great collaboration .
And it 's from the Web , managon the web , managon .
You can see it when we do this kind of screen , where we can go from an image to the other image of this , and have this kind of experience to the multiple .
But the space collocation of the imagination here has actually meaning .
The algorithms of visualization of the computer have recorded these images together , so that corresponds to the real places that I imagine -- all of the argue -- all of the nearararms of the Rocck-shot . Here you get a slightly .
I don 't know if I have time to show you some other environment .
There are a lot more space .
I want to go directly to one of the original data of Noahhhhsynthahsyntheshsynththroy-prototype of Photosynthroy-based data , to show you what I think is really the key to be the key to be very clear with this technology , the technology Photosynth . And it 's not necessarily evident that we put in the website .
We had to worry about legal aspects and forth .
This is a reconstruction of Notre Dame images of Glaus , who are going to be a Flickr . Bastic digitchr and you get images of the kinds of areas and the campuzzy , other of the campuzzle is discovery , and it 's discovery , and it 's discovery tening to this model .
So they 're all images in Flickr and they 've been all linked to the space in this way .
And it 's possible to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to navigate this very simple way .
You know , I would never have thought to end up for Microsoft .
It 's very gratificent , you get this kind of accovery here .
I think you can see that it 's a lot of different kinds of photos , and that 's the ones of the phones of the SLR , an annotion , a meanananative number , put together in this environment .
And if I can , I try to look for those more strange .
Many are block by doing it , etc .
Somewhere there is a series of photographs -- there .
This is a poster of Notre Dame came registration .
We can go from the physics to this environment .
The essential point is that we can do things with social environment . This is now taking data from the whole thing to the whole memory of how it looks like the Earth , from the visual point of view -- and connects all these data together .
All those pictures become connected together , more than the sorts of parts .
You have a model of the land intery that emerging .
Think about this as a prolungation of Stephen Lawler on Earth .
It 's something that grows in complexity as a kind of thing that people use , and the advantages of people are going to use .
Their pictures are marked with metadicked by other people .
If you get somebody comes the idea of contradication all these sorts of things , my name , my own cattedral of Children 's suddenly arricches of all these data , and I can use how to use as a point of a space , in that metapherself , using the photos of everyone else , and have a whole whole experience of a kind of cross-mooth , and you use the cross-user experience of the shapes .
Of course , a consequence of everything is very , virtual models of any interesting , collecting all of the interesting part of the Earth , and you know , and that you know , but by the collective memory .
Thank you .
Chris Anderson : I 've got to do well ? What your software is going to be doing is that at a certain point , in the next few years , all the photographs are going to be practically related to ? What you can you do ? What you do you do ? What you do you do you do ? What your software is that you do ? What your software is going to be done with ? What your software to be done is that that you do with it is that ,
BAA : Yeah . What 's doing is doing in practice is to discover .
It 's creating hyperlink , if you want , between images .
And it 's doing it in the base of the images .
The thing becomes very interesting if you think about the rich information semantical information semantics that many of these images .
As when you 're doing a search of images , you have a phrase and the text on the webs of the web has a lot of information about the picture .
Now , what happens if that picture is links to all your pictures ?
So the amount of semantics , and the amount of rcheapy that it 's really huge . It 's a classic classic . It 's a classic classic .
CA : Blaise , it 's really amazing . Compice .
BAA : I thank you very much .
One of the most most most most likely when you travels and one of the delicious research is the able to live between who has no antial antials that traditions , between the wind , the advert in the wind , the wind the stage in the wind , the leversus the floating the plants .
Basti thinking that scientists , Jaguar vibryond Via , or that the advanthropolicy , or that the anthropology of the anthropology , the buddates still the respile of the Dharm , but to remember the world 's a very well , to remember the central importance of anthropology , and that the idea that we live in which we are not existed in a model , but it 's just a model of reality ,
the consequence of a particular adaptative , which our estrrpe has done , well or bad , many generations ago .
And , of course , we all share of essential tracks .
We all procreating .
We are subjects that are initiation .
We have to death the inesorability of death , so we don 't surprise if we 're going to be .
we all have a art .
What it is the particular rhythm of the song , the rhythm of every culture .
Not matter that they are the Penan inforests of the Borneo , or the follow Vodoo 's the Haiti , or the deserriest glower in Kenya , or the Cander 's Candandander , the Currot Sahara .
He was my journey of journey in the desert a month ago , or a yak alator of yak in Qomolangme , on Everest , the Everest , the dey of the world .
All these people teachers have other ways of exist other ways of exist other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , other ways of move in the world .
And , if you think , you think , it 's a concept that it can give you hope .
Insilent with , the myries of the world are creating a spiritual life and cultural cultural , which is important for the well-being of the planet and it 's important for the well-being of the planet as biosphere .
And you can think about this ragnosphere , as a ethnosphere , and you can call the etnosphere , and you can call the etnosphere , all , ideas , intuitions , intuitions , intuitions , intuitions bring to be from the human alumps of consciousness .
The etnosphere is the fantastic painting of humanity .
It 's the symble of what we are and what we can be in how species inquisitive .
And because the biosphere was gravely consumed , as a very quickly has happened to the etnosphere , and very quickly .
Nothing biologist , for example , it would say that 50 percent of all species is the kind of thing is about the orlo of the exintion just because it 's fake , or -- in the OOnnapocalm -- in the field of biological diversity .
The indicates everything is , of course , of course , the language .
When you were born 6,000 languages on this planet .
One language is not only a vocabolary of a series of rules .
One language is the guy that the human spirit .
It 's the half of the animal that the animal of every culture is in the material world .
Every language is a forest of mind , a backin , a thought , a backin that kind of a spiritual possibility of spiritual .
And of those 6,000 languages , as we are here to Monterey , at least the half half of the sat in the oreck orches in the oreck orches .
They 're not teaching kids , the kids , which means , not not the trust something , which is already already death .
What is the most sad of being aved by the silence , of being the last to talk about a language , of being the language of the wisdom of the saving of the kids ?
This is refed by somebody in the world in some of the world every two weeks , every two weeks , a child die , and it 's going to sis in the last silllats and a language .
And I know somebody of you say , " Don 't that much ?
The world is not a better place if we 're talking about all the same language ? " Benissim , then we talk about yoruba . We talk to the dotonese .
We talk about kogi .
You 're going to have a tract thing that means that we can 't talk about their language .
I 'd like to do a journey through the etnosphere --
a little journey in the etnosphere to give you a kind of what we 're losing .
Many of us dimentymenticate that when I say , " different ways of exist . " I mean different ways of existing .
Let 's take for example , the Barasana , in Amazon Amazon Amazon , the anacond of the anaconda , which creates the myth of the latest sandandwest in the sandandwest of the sandandwest in the sandandwest of snars .
It 's a popular popular that it 's not able to distinguess color by the green color , because the time you were identified in the forest , which depends on the popular .
They have a strange language and a major rule , called " examia . " You have to tell you a person who 's a different language .
Everything has radical in the past mitologist , yet , the particularity is that in these families are in these exese families that are in these , or seven languages of maps .
They 're limitate to listen and then they start to talk .
Let 's take one of the most interesting tribe with which I 've lived , the Waorani of Ecuador , an amazing popular people that had the earlier contacts in 1958 .
In 1957 , missionaries have trying to make a mistake .
They had done from the top photographs that they were retruly reflecting them in a friendly , deployed that this popular of the rainforest , had never seen anything bi-dimensional dimensional .
They collected the picture of the land , they 've been going to have a shape or a fle-shape , and not found anything , they said that the diavy of the diavor , and they kill five missionaries with lance .
But the Waorani doesn 't kill only to kill the stranipaign .
They kill you kill between them .
54 percent of the mortality was caused by their own .
We 've been eight generations and we found two cases of natural morath and when we 've been remarkable to know , they lose that one of them was invectured , and then they killed it the same . [ Risate ] Ad every way , they had an amazing forest knowledge of the forest .
The crumers were able to recognize the animal of 40 steps and recognizes the species .
In the early ' 80s , I 've been assigned a very interesting task when my professor of Harvard , if I wanted to go to Harvard to the base of the Duvalier and Tonton Macooling the power of Duvalier and Tonton Macooling and and Monton Macooler , and impossessentially , and impossessentially , and I got to do the zoms .
To make sense of a miracology of miracology , I would have to understand the Vodoo is not magic .
It 's pretty much about a complex view of metapphysics .
Many interesting .
If I ask you to tell me the great religions of the world , what would you say ?
Cristianesimum , Islam , Buddism , Ebraism , etc .
A continent is always left out , thinking that the sub-Saharan Africa has no religious features . And it 's yyes and the Vodoo is not the other that the distills of these concepts of religious concepts of slavery .
What makes interesting the voodoo is the intense I 'm going to report between life and death .
So the vision they 're going to be hire the spirites .
The spirites can be invoced by the Grande Acqua , they say , the rhyththm of the dance of the vial of the vial way that for a short , that 's a short thing that for a short short , the following becomes the .
So , the voodooists love to say , " You know , you 're going to talk about God .
We say , " We say , " We say God . "
And since you 're all possitting , is the spirit that you drive to you , how bad you do you ?
So you have these incredible events : following voodoo in the state of trance that touch impunts are that touches like , in the power of the mind when it 's catalyzed in the body of the power when it 's catalyzed in an extreme of extreme .
And all the people I 've lived the most extraordinary is the Kogi of Sierra Nevada Santa Marta , in the Santa Marta , in the Santa Marta , in the Santa Marta , in the Santa Marta , in the Santa Marta , in the Santa Marta , in the Santa Marta , in the Santa Marta , in the Santa Marta , in the Santa Marta , in the Santa Marta , in the Santa Marta Santa Marta Marta , in Santa Mar
Indeed of the ancient civilization that once once they were living on the charaibia , the popular of the Colombia in the conquician , the popular of the vulcanic massive , which is retreated on the vulcanic mass .
In a smacchievement of blood , this popular , this popular is never been conquisted by the Spanish .
But now , they 're government today , they 're government to a clero , but their formation is really extraordinary .
The young follows are being taken from the familiar to three or four years , and they live secrecrecrecrecrecret in a world of good , and shopped it up to the basic basic of the glacious for 18 years .
Two periods of nine years of the depends of proposes to reproduce the nine months of management that transformation in the ushor of the mother of Grande Mother .
So , for this time , they 're acculturate values of their society , values that predict their prayers , and only their preglect balance , or to say the balance of the conmic balance .
In the term of this amazing initiation , they 're suddenly out and for the first time in their life , at the age of 18 years , they see an alba . And in that active , when the sun the sun values , when the sun the sun values of beautiful , everything that has learned in theory is confermed in the theory . The pret a step . The pret is a step back , and he says , and it says , and he says , and it 's a step it is ,
" Would you like to you . "
It 's amazing . Now it 's study . "
They call them as much greater brother and they say that we , the minors , we are the collipevolution of the world .
This is extremely important .
When we think about indigenous Ingene and the environment Roussea Rousseau and the old story of the wildlife , which is a razen concept in his simplicity in his simplicity , we say that these people are closest to the Earth of us .
The Ingengenes are not fefefefefeeling .
There 's no space for these things in the palud of the Asmallat , or in the winds of Tibet , but thank you to the time and reversus , they created a mystical of the Earth 's not about concept of the most subtle , but on an intuition that Earth can only live only because it 's infected by the human consciousness can only live by the human consciousness .
What does it mean ?
It 's saying that a girl of Ande that 's a little bit of the Ande that the mountain is a spirit of Apu that will be a human being deeply different .
which is the dimady of a spirit or a mineral fast is irrelevant .
What 's interesting is that that 's interesting is that defines the relationship between the individual and the natural world .
I grew up in the forests of the British Columbia credary that the forests to be cut .
So , this is a human being different from my friends Kwakiutl that believe that the forests are the Hukuk 's dise of the Hukuk and the bandand-well-histories that are living in the world , spiriters that are living in the Hamatsa .
If you start to look at that these cultures can create real , you could start to understand some their own feelings .
I 've been taken this picture of open in the nordoctor in the nordoccctors .
Maybe some of you have heard of the ayachievement , the most powerful place of the chiamantic repertotoid of the chiamanic repertotoilet .
What makes it fascinating the ayahuasking is not the potential potential of the substance of the place , but his election . It 's how two things .
In one side , this liana launch that has a series of carbon , harmful , harmful and harmolines , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very ,
Take the only plants , you have a blure that altery , but it 's measurements with the consciousness , but it 's measurements with the leaves of the family of coffee Psychotria .
This plant plant plant , very similar to serotonin , very similar to the serotonin , dimethoxtamine-5 , methoxt-ine-5 , methoxt-btrypamine .
If you 'll ever see Yanomami , you 'll ever see Yanomami , the place that do from a different species , anchis contained methoxt-pamine .
Tiring that polar on the nose is a little bit like to be dissold by a sweet of paints , and land on a sweet of electricity . [ Recated ] not create a distoration of reality .
I was often a lot of my professor , Richard Evan Shultes , the man who has taken the psychedelical psychedelical , with his discovery of the fungi of the lower fungi of the lower fungi in Mexico .
In my rot-hesis , you can 't have to classify these trippamines as hallucinated hallucinated .
It 's possible to be able to be able to be able to advice with other chemicals that denize the MAOOr .
Now , it 's the beautiful beautiful , the carboline that are injobs in this liana are injobs of the same type of inary to power tripamines . The question sorts is , in a flying 80,000 species of plants , how do these people are going to find out of the other plants , how do these people have to be in this way , create a biopieces of biochemical parts ?
We use the great eufemism of the proof and the mistake , that can reveal infrution .
But if we ask the Indians , they 'll say , " The plants are talking about . "
What does it mean ?
This tribes , the Cofan , has 17 variety of ayachieveventually distinguess in the forest , and that you can get in the same species .
If we ask how they say , " " Way their tassonomy will say , " I 'd understand it , " I realize it 's plants , you don 't know ? "
The solution is : you 're taking the 17 variety of a full of lone , and each one will be a different smoon .
With this not in Harvard , but it 's much more interesting that content the stami .
Now , [ applaushed ] the problem is that even the people of them are being paintings , but somehow reducts are paintings , but somehow reducts to our real world , and it 's going to be beyond .
In fact , the 19th century , between 300 years , it 's not going to be remind for his or technologic innovations , but rather as the thing we were stopped and acactive actively accepted or accepted , or accepted to the world of biological diversity and cultural diversity and cultural cultural mass is not change .
All cultures through the centuries have been involved in a dance of life .
And the problem is not the technology .
The Indians Sioux have no stopped to be Sioux when they put out of the archieved and they do it as the Americans have no stopped to be Americans when they put out in the horal and calute .
It 's not the change or the technology that integrity of the etnosphere . It 's the power .
The flight flight of domination .
And if you go to the world , I 'll find that these are not destinated cultures that these are not destinated to disappeared .
They are living and living dynamic and spints out of the hyth-existence , they go beyond their skills .
I know , I 'm sboscaming in the painting of the Penan --
a popular nobble , in the west asian named East , a popular popular , a popular popular , and now reduced to a generation , and now reduced to the servitor , where you can see the river the river in the southern Mar Cinese Mar Cinese Mar Cinese Mar Cinese Mar Cinese Merian Merian Merian Merian Merian Mouth Mahorian , where the horizon Mahorizon Moridian .
With the wood stone of the subtact with the subtact of the forest .
Or , in the case of Yanomami , are the disease that I 've got to have the discovery of the gold .
If we move on on the mountains of the Tibet , where I 'm doing a lot of research , you 'll see the during the political domination .
As you know the genocide , physics of a popular , is convicted to universal level , but the ethnocide , the destruction of life , not just is not just as a popular , but advvice adicted in certain environments .
And you can 't understand the suffering of Tibet until you go from the beginning .
I 've been going to 6,000 miles from Chength in China China in China , and I come to Lhasa with young link , and it 's only coming in Lhasa with young link , but only came to Lhake . I realized what we 've heard about .
6,000 sacres reducts in polar , and they cut up .
1.2 million people killed by military during the Cultural Rivolution .
The father of this guy was absolutely absolutely the guy called Panchen Lama .
which means that it was killed by the temple of the Chinese invasion .
His I was worse with Santity in Santity during the diaspora that has taken the popular in Nepal .
Sua mother was imprigioned and his cold was to be rich .
It was brought to career to the age of two years from the age of two years in his gonna because it could not have to live without him .
The sister , which has done the same , it was put in referred in reference .
A day , he inavailable in a window-coffign fascinating Mao and , for this transgression , it was put in the journey of the Since .
The Tibet is to be inoveroveroveroveroveroveroveroverovercome , but the spirit reesterday .
At the fall , everything is reduce to a choice .
We want to live in the world in the monothic world of the monotony or we want to account the world polycles ?
The great anthropologist , before we 're death said that his greatest fear was that , in our greatest fear was that , in our view of the world , not only we 'll see the whole gama of human redoctor , but a day we 're going to see from a day , we 're going to see from a sleep to a sleep , and we 're other possibility .
And it 's a million million million of the way that our species is exist for 600,000 years .
The Neolitic Rivolution , who has given us the agriculture , that has done us underlify to the seed of the smomovement of the smomovement of the sleep , creating the gerarchieving of specialization , and we talk about 10,000 years ago .
The modern world industrialized , has 300 years old .
That 's the story of not suggests that we have the answers to all the challenges that we have to deal in the millennia to come .
When these myriads of cultures of the world is asked what it means to be human , they say , they say , they say , they say , " they say what humans is , they say what humans is , they say what humans to say to be human , they say what to be human , they say , " they say what to be human , they say what to be human , they say what to be human , they say to say to be human ,
And it 's in these answers that we all have to be the possibility of being what we are , a kind of conscious , that has to make all the people and all the gardens can be what all of the people can be what we are .
I 've been taken this picture on the northertherthertherthertherthern island , when I went to the whaled of the Inuit , and this man , Olaya , Olaya , and this man , Olaya , and this man , Olaya , and this man , Olaya , and this man , Olaya , and this man , Olaya , and this man , Olaya , and this man , Olaya , and this man ,
The government government is not always gentile with the Inuit is not always gentile with the Inuit , and in the 1950s to stbilizes our .
The grandfather of this man refutting to us .
The family , I 've been given to his life , and all his attended out , and all his attackets .
You have to know that Inuit not tems the cold , they do it .
The pattins of sllaps in origin were made of pain .
The grandfather of this man didn 't have been intimight from the night , or from the libraries that was suffering .
It 's sgattaitholated , it 's calated the ptants in the skin of phoca and defecated in their hand . When the did you do it , it 's a working .
He spryzed the dog on the dog of this hand-up handed , and when he became solid , he killed a dog .
He 's got a slaughter , and created a brilliance , with the rotical cass of a slettt-handed shaped , and it 's disappeared on the bank , the hit in the remain .
We want to talk about cavarsely with anything ? [ Risate ] . And this , in different ways , [ Applausi is the symbbol of the resilience of the Inugal population and all the indigenous of the world .
In the april of the aprist government has redated by Inuit , the total control of an area of the biggest California and Texas a whole area of the greatest California and Texas a together .
It 's their new paper . It 's called Nunavut .
It 's a independent territory . They trolding all the resources of mineraries .
One splendied example of as a national natione-state can recognize with his popular .
And , I think it 's pretty obvious at least in those remote song of us was in these remote song of the planet , realization that they 're not going to be remote .
For somebody 's home .
They represents of the human imagination that rises to the dress of the temple . And for us all of these kids , like the dreams of our kids , are part of the geography of hope .
First , we of National Geographic , we convince that politicians will never be anything .
We think the polemies --
[ Applausi is not persuasive , but we think that stories can change the world , and maybe we have the best institution to tell the stories of the world . Oach our website has 35 million visits . ]
156 countries , they spend our television .
Our rivers are being thletters from millions of people .
Our work is to travel in the ethnosphere to bring our public places of wonderful cultural cultural , which will go out of how they saw and , you hope , habled , and they will , and they will have to be able to be able to come in in diversity , and we have to find a life in a pluralist and we have to find a life in a pluralist and multultural , and we have to find a life in a pluralist and the microbic world of life of life .
where the wisdom of all the people can contribute to our benefit of our benefit .
Thank you .
I 'm going to talk about some things I wrote in this book that I hope you 've heard and proversus that you 've heard and proversus to obvious some of the links , in the case you 're not born them .
I want to start with what I call " the official official dogma . "
The dogma official dogen official ?
The dogma official dogma official society , the Western official dogma : " If we want to massive the well-being of our citizens . "
The reason is , from one side , in fact that freedom is in itself , it 's pretious , is pretious , is pretious , essential , to be pretious , essentially , the essential , is pretious , is pretively pretively , useful , it is pretious , is pretively , useful , is pretitious , is pretious , useful ,
Our one is that if we are free , each of us can act for their own to do everything that massive to do everything that massive , not no one that you decide of our benefit , no one that 's called our .
The way to massive freedom is massive to be the choice .
More choices people have , more they are free , and more more , and more more more , they are their benefit , the more they are .
So , I think , it 's so deeply radicated in society that nobody would have to put it in doubt .
And it 's also deeply radicated in our lives .
I 'm going to show you some examples of what progress has to be possible .
This is my supermarket . It 's not particularly big .
I lose a simple note on the saved of injumps .
In my supermarket , there are 175 conditions , without contate 10 variety of the olive of the olive of olive oil and 12 aceters you can buy for a huge amount of conditions that you can buy for the multimate .
Here is what the supermarket .
Then you go to the electronic store to buy a store : casse , the CD lector , radio , radio , piahand , the amplifier .
And in this single snapy , there 's a big number of audio components .
We can make six million and a half million different combinations , using the components that there are only in a store .
You have to admit that there is a lot of choice .
Altri camps : the world of communications .
Once when I was a child , you could get all the telephone services , to the pat the pact that were forborn by Mama Bell .
He was a phone , you didn 't buying it .
One consequence of this , between the other thing , was that the phone , you never break .
These days , they went .
Now we have a nearly variety of telephones , especially between the cellphones .
Here 's the future cell phones .
My favorite is that in the middle , P3 , tapeli , and the foreign for the brulele bruling for the brulele brulele .
If you don 't have the store in the store under the house , you 're going to be well .
And what happens to the end is that people come in in the negots , and it does this question . And you know what the answer is " No . "
It 's not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn 't do too much .
So , in other things that are much more important than the acquisissues , you know , the same thing is explosion of choices .
Axxtustence : it doesn 't happen to the United States that you go from the doctor and the doctor you need to do .
Instead , you go from the doctor , and the doctor says , " Okay , we could do . " Or " A" " " A" these well-free and these said , " By this well-free and these well-risk , what you want to do ? "
You say , " Dotore , what I would you do ? "
And the doctor says , " A has these benefits and answers , and B has these benefits and answers . "
" What do you want to do ? "
And you say , " Dotore if she was me , what would you do ? "
And the doctor : " But I 'm not going to be . "
The result of the " autonomy of malked , " expression that it seemed to be a beautiful thing .
But it 's not that one you move the fish and responsibility to make decisions from somebody knows something , which is the doctor , to somebody else knows anything -- and so it 's not about -- and so it 's not about it -- and so not in the ideal condition to make the patient .
There 's a huge marketing of products , you 're going to have a huge marketing of people like me and you think , that if you think you think it 's not a sense , because you can 't buy them .
But if we can 't buy them , why do they public ?
The answer is that they want to be that domorning we call the doctor to ask us to change the rich .
What we like this fundamental as a thing is our identity is a question of choice , as you see in this view , " We don 't want to force kids . Sceat . " We 're going to be the right . " We need to invent . "
And we can reinvented what we can do .
which means that every morning , at the risk , you have to decide that kind of person you want to be .
It was very very family and the major time , a time the common perspective , unless , which was that there was that there was a fest possible as possible as possible as possible .
The only verage green-choice was with who , not when , and even what do after .
Ose , it 's really about play .
I teach very smart students , and I do 20 percent of the work of time .
And it 's not because they are less diligent .
but why I 'm impensierated , I mean , I would you say , " I would you say , " I would you say to do this now ? "
" Do I have to tell me later ? "
They 're interrogatives logatives .
And they try to answer these questions , even if this implacy not to be able to be able to do that that I 'm going to have a beautiful vote to my exame .
And they have to do that . They 're important questions .
Now , the work : we are fortunate , as Carl underneath , because the technology allows us to work every day , from every day , from every day , from every day , from every corner of the Randolph .
And there 's a parenty corner , and I didn 't tell anyone , where the WiFi works .
I don 't tell you , because I want to use it .
What does this mean , this amazing freedom of choice that we have to do ? It 's going to continue , continuously , if we have to work or not .
We can go to see our son play a playing on the cell phone , with the Blackberry in the other , and the noticity , and the noticity , and the noticicity , on the ginock .
And even though I 'm all spent , every minute that we see our son is also given to the game , we 're also asking this called ? "
" Do I answer this email ? I have to get this letter ? "
And even when the answer is " not , " everything is , " All this makes your son very different from what it 's going to be in other conditions .
So , as we look at all , small , things and big , materials and life , the materials and styles of life , the question of you .
Once the world was this : Ovreal , there were some possibilities , but it was a question of choice .
The world of today is a good thing , or the dilemma is , " Is that a positive thing , or negative ? "
The answer is Same : The answer is Same .
The positive latest laten we all know , so I 'm going to talk about the negative ones .
All this choice compories two effects negative effects on people .
The first , paradoxtisally , is that it 's that it 's going to be freecting .
With many options between which choices choices , becomes very difficult to do it .
I give you an example of a meanananants of pack-pencil plans .
A connects had access to the Soud data , the gigantic society of the source of pension , with about a million clients in 2,000 different companies .
What she found was that for every 10 solutions that are coming in more , the percentage of two percent .
With 50 source source source , there 's a less than the adesions are only five . Why ?
Because with 50 source source source that you choice , is maledly difficult to decide , and choice is sent to be sent to the tomorrow .
And I 've been tomorrow , and again , tomorrow , and of course , and of course , we 've never come to .
You know , it doesn 't mean that these work from old old , because they 're not going to have enough money , because they don 't have enough money , it 's so ostical that lose the decision is so ostical that lose is so ostical that lose the dators of work .
I don 't participating it , they 're losing until five to the dator of work , which would be well disposed to be there .
So the paralysis is consequence of having too many choices .
And I think it makes the world .
" And to finish , for the land-wire , heternity , senape or maionese ? "
You would say , you 're going to take the right decision , if it 's for the eternity , right ?
You don 't want to choose the wrong wrong deep , and you 're the wrong condition .
So this is the first effect . The second is that we can avoid paralysis and do a choice , at the end we 're less subddisfaced by the result of how we were to be with less comfort of the things that you choose .
And this for different reasons .
One of these is that with a lot of these is that you choose , if you buy a and not perfect , it 's easy to imagine that you could do a different choice that you could do a different choice that it would be better . And what happens is that the alternative input put put the sophister of choice , and the rediant rediant demines the sound that the sophistence of the decision that is that it to be better . And what happens to be better . And what happens to be better . And what happens is that the heat ,
even when it was a good decision .
More choices are , more easy to displeasure than any detection that is insophister of option .
And also , there 's what economists call it expensive .
Dan Gilbert said , very well , as the value of the value that we do to things depends on what we confront .
The rest , when there are so many options , it 's easy to be to represent the features of the alternative alternative alternative alternative alternative alternative alternative alternative alternative alternative alternative alternative alternative alternative alternative alternative alternative alternative alternative alternative alternative alternative alternative alternative alternative alternative alternative alternative alternative alternative alternative alternative ,
Here 's an example . I 've been with all the ones that are not New York .
But that 's what you would probably think .
There 's this copy of the Hamptons .
A lussian place .
It 's all slendida . It 's all about their own .
Not nothing . But what he thinks is , " Well , the malaria , it 's Agotured . "
" Everybody 's my neighborhood is on . "
" I could talk about it right in front of home . "
And it 's going to spend two weeks I have a day -- every day -- the opportunity to parking -- the possibility of parking where it wants .
The constoopportunity diminule is deminuddisfation for what we have , as a cell .
And the most are the options that we have to be more , more the attractive characteristic .
Here 's another example .
This is a lot of things .
It 's about the time , and maybe a living of living .
But the most important point is that you choice , you 're going to be like to do not do the other .
The things that we don 't choose to be able to attractive , that can make less attractive what we do .
Third point : The spiral growing of expectations .
I tried it on my skin buying a new couple of jeans .
I 'm almost always jeans .
Once jeans were just like , you know , they were good and windows from the besty , they were discovered , only after you had them a life and work with a lot of times , they were starting to go well .
So , I went to buy a couple of new when the old old old , and I said , " I need a couple of jeans , this is my cut . "
The commit to me to me , " Lake slim , what does it , rely fit ? "
Do you want to have the cernist with the bottons ? " Stonega-? " His " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " Hi " " " Hijujujudgments "
" Look wants ? "
" Would you like to get them to the blap ? Bil -- " Continured to get elenjoy .
I was sbalord , and after a little bit , and after a little bit , I want the kind of -- which was the only kind of " I want to be , so for a time , I tried to all these jeans , and then I used to get out of the negotials , and then I used to be .
It was the massixth . With all that I had the best .
But I felt worse .
Why ? I wrote a whole book for understood it .
The reason I was worse is that with all that choice is that with all that choice was very high , the jeans had to be perfect .
I was at the beginning I was expected to do anything about except when it was there only one kind of like , but when it saw 100 different , steps , at least one kind of had to be perfect .
What I had buy y was good , but not perfect .
After I had to talk about that chosen with what I was trying to do is in confront of expectations .
And it add of options in life of people don 't do that increasing the excellence of the options of the same .
And this will be less subdisfation , even when the result of the result of them .
Nobody in the world of marketing , if you realize .
Because if they knew , you would not know what I 'm talking about .
The truth is the most of the most of this .
" He was better when it was worse , " The reason that was better when it was worse is that when it was worse was worse is that when it was worse was worse .
Ose , the world we live in -- opulents , industrialized , industrialized , with the massisix-feature , the massix-thing that we can hope is that things are in the altitude of expectations .
You never have surprised as much as you like , because your expectations , the expectations , they 're ingigantite .
The secret of happiness -- what you 're here -- is , " By " waiting , " Yes , you want . "
I mean -- small highbiographic moment -- that I 'm really married and my wife is really amazing .
I could not do better , I couldn 't do , I 'm content .
But it 's not always a bad thing .
Finally , a consequence of buy a couple of jeans that when there 's just that kind of jeans is that when you 're not suddisfaced , and you ask , " Why ? "
" Who is responsible ? " , the answer is close .
The world is responsible . What could you do ?
When there are hundreds of kinds of jeans , and you buy a insubsidefacing , and you ask who is the responsible , it 's the clear , is the clear that the responsible you .
You could do better .
With hundreds of variety of variety of variety of variety of variety of variety of variety of variety of variety of variety of variety of variety of variety of variety of variety of variety of variety of variety of variety of variety of variety of variety of variety of variety of vari
So when people take decisions , even if the result is alive , they feed up , they feel insoddisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdissudden , they 're going to be able to be decisions .
In the last few years , the depression is explose in in the industrialized world .
I think a meanananants -- not the only one , but important -- of this depression of depression is that the people have been too high high .
And when they have to explain this situation think that the colame is they think that cold is their own .
So the final result is that we 're going to general , objectively , but we felt there .
Let me remember you .
This is the official dogma , what we 're all going to take for good and it 's completely fly . It 's not true .
There 's no doubt that a little bit better than I have to do , but it doesn 't really really really choice is better than you have to be better than a little bit .
There 's a critical value , I don 't know what it 's .
But I 'm sure we 've been going to have overcome from a piece of the level where the level of the level that the best choices to our life .
Now , from the political point of view -- I 've almost finished -- from the political point of view , the nocction is the following .
What it allows this thing that is the material of material ,
There are a lot of places in the world , and you know , where the problem is not that they have too many choice .
The problem is that they have too few .
So the factory I 'm talking about is a malbeing exclusive of modern modern society , remarkable , remarkable , remarkable , remarkable , remarkable , remarkable , the Western .
And what it does to depress and climbs is this : Steve Levitt you 've been talking about how much that expensive and discover ways that they 're inuseful . It 's a sprite of money .
I mean these choices , complicated and available , it 's not that they 're not going to be useful .
I 'm a dollar writing .
They 're worse .
If you have a little bit of what in our society is that we 've been reversated in those where people have too much possibilities , it would not only be their life to improve , but our own life .
This is what economists call a improve improving improve .
A redistribution of redistribution is good at all -- not only to poverty -- because of this choice in excess that we get us .
To finish : " Fililla , you can become everything you want to --
You know , people of culture , you think , " But what that fish ? "
" It 's obvious that you can 't make anything in a glass of glass . "
" A imagination castrated view , a limited view of the world -- "
and anchI 've got the interpret so , at the beginning .
But then , think , instead , I 'm realized that that fish is a long way .
Because the reality of the fact is that if you managed in frantums , so that , " everything is possible , " you can 't get the freedom . You get the paralysis .
If you break the box , you can deminate the satisfaction .
And you get the paralysis , and you get the benefit .
Everybody need a sphere .
This is almost certainly too closely , maybe even for the fish , and it 's sure for us .
But the absolutely symbolic sphere is a recipe for infelity and , for the roof .
Thank you very heart .
