I 've showed these slide demonstrate demonstrate that the calottical calottics , for almost three million years had had the size of the 48 continental size of the 48 continental .
However , you have a lot of the problem because it doesn 't show the spent of the ice .
The glacial calottical cycle is , in a certain sense , the puls-climate system .
You get up of the inverno and you get the summer .
The next slide will be a rapid carrelated carrelate to the last 25 years .
The ice accounts are signed in red .
You see , you see , you 're going to go to blue .
That 's the ice in the wint , which is the ice in the summer .
You can see that cosit said , the ice ice , of five years or more , is as blood , which is as blood , which is as blood , which is as blood .
In 25 years , it 's been spent for so .
This is a problem because the rescale of the entire land , the ice ice ice ice ice ice , where there are huge amounts of carbon congelt , where you 're going to get in metmetmetmetmetmetmetmetmetmetmetmetmetmetmetmetmetmetmetmetmetmetmetmetmetmetmetmetmetmetmetmetmetmetmetmetmetmetmetmetmetmetic .
I think about the totality of the inatmospspread of global inatmosphere , that could double , super-scale , that could double , super-re-re-re-recently .
In some of the laghi , in Alaska meter in Alaska .
The professorse Katey Walter of the University of Alaska bunch of a blow last last ball of a bunch last inverno .
Video : Wow ! Al Gore : Look . The question is , if we 're also going to be .
And that 's why this is the thermaps of the Groenland from the northern North .
This is a glacial regime .
The took took to have never reached livels .
This is the Kangerlussuaq , in the sound of the Groenland .
If you want to know how to be the sea level for the sea for the sea of the sea .
These are going to do ,
The other hand of the planet : Antartes , the largest bloclock of the planet .
The month last month scientist have dikey that the argued of the ice is in negative , and that Antarttes in the Western , which is a few hysun of the sun , is particularly fast .
Equest to six feet of the level of the acque , like Groenland .
Sulla Himalaya , the larger third bloclock , which is a few years ago , who was glacier .
40 percent of the population is going to get to the water for the potail .
Sulle Ande : this glacier is the source of the water ,
The luck is increase .
But when you diminug it , the same happens to water .
In California the nenow , the nenow , the nenow ,
The background are in crime .
The predictions , you know , you 're pretty much .
The growth in the world door to a remarkable remarkable .
The environmental disaster , are increasing a ritm outside of the normal and without precedenter .
Four times more numbers in the last 30 years ,
This is a wand-up all insustainable .
If you look at the historical context , if you can see the consequences .
In the last five years we add 70 million tons of CO2 every 24 hours -- 25 million tons in the ocean every day .
Look at the Pacific acific area , the American American , the American American , to the west , and on both both of the subcontinent , where there is a radical roomer of the ocean .
The major cause of global warming , and that 's 20 percent , is the 20 percent , is the use of fossil combustible .
The oil is a problem , and the carbon is even worse .
The United States are one of the two countries with the most emissions , together to China .
And you 'd proposite to build many other central carbon .
But we 're doing it to a change of direction .
These are the anullated projects in the last years and some protected alternative alternative projects .
And there 's a political load in our country .
The carbon industry and oil industry have spent 250 million dollars in the last year for promoting carbon , which is a bunch , which is a oxy-dollar .
And that image I remember something --
I see Natal , in Tennessee , where I live , there was a 3.8 billion likers of last square lighting lighting of the last carbon .
Maybe you 've seen on the news .
This is the second larger flow of last last fluss in America .
It 's happened around Natal .
The adverage of one of the carbon industry was this .
Video : I 'm going to be a higher , is a kind of allegro and happy .
It 's abundate here in America , and it 's grow our economy .
Frorosty the carbon is more and more .
It 's a good price , adorable and the work , they 're going to be pending .
Al Gore : The way here is a lot of the West Virginia .
The larger largest society on mountain is Massey Coat . This is his friministrator .
Video : Don Blankenship : Sark , Nancy Peloks , Harry Reid , Harry Reid -- they don 't know what they 're talking about .
Al Gore : So the Alleance for the Clima has launched two campaine .
This is a lot of them , a part .
Video : Acore : Alla COALergy , we see the climate change as a sery business .
So , our priority is investing a big amount of money in a song in a advertising , to make a public , and you use the verity of the carbon .
In fact , the carbon is not sporite .
We think it 's clean -- it 's also a good profuel .
So , not preothy of climate change .
Let me do it .
Video : Acore : You 've heard of it .
So let 's do a lot of a structure at the building in a building for the bottom of the pulit .
Straordinary ! The machines are a little rumorous , but this is the sound of the carbon technology .
The consumer is between the main cause of global warming , but the night technology of the bottom of global carbon , but the technology of the pulit that you see changes all .
You look at a look at : this is the odiergn technology .
Al Gore : Infinally , the alternative , the positive economic issues and to the national security .
Video : The America is in crime ; the economy , the national economy , the national economy , the climate crime .
The fall that connects to all : our dependence from the combustible combustible , like carbon , as the sporite and oil .
Now , there 's a new , audace , audace solution for use .
Real-America : 100 percent of the energy , in 10 years .
A to reput America to work , to make sure , and help us make sure , and help help stop the global warming .
Finally , a solution that basts to solve our problems .
Reality America . Scoprite more .
Al Gore : This is the last .
Video : Comment : It 's to return to America .
One of the fastest ways to do the dependence of the combustible that kills our planet .
SS : The future is here . It 's a sun , a new network .
Man : Noves : Noves investment for jobs .
Pholder America . It 's time to be realists .
Al Gore : A old old old old , you know , " If you want to go fast , you go to fast .
If you want to go away , you go together . "
We have to go away away , fast .
Thank you very much .
Last year at TED fall on the LHC .
And promise to get back to how the car works .
So , I got to do it . And for those that the other time , there were no big scientific experiment ever tented -- 27 kilometers of the conference .
His compask is is to reating the conditions that were less than a million million than the universe -- until 600 million times a second .
All of that is just environmentous .
This is the machine in Ginevra .
We have a raying these min-Big Bang inside the revolution .
This is what I work . It 's called ATLAS -- is , 44 feet and has a hander than 22 feet .
This is a spectacular image of ATLATLAS in building so you can see proportions .
To 10 sets of the last year we have acceso the car for the first time .
And this picture was taken by ATLATLAS .
It was because of immend stopped in the room .
It 's a picture of the first fascinating particles that had done all the around of the LHC , entering in collision , with a part of HC , and spread particles inside the reflies .
In other words , when we see that image 10 to sets , and we understand that the car work , which is a big viculation .
I don 't know if it was to do that , when somebody went to Google , when somebody went on on Google and saw that the pages was this .
And that means we had a cultural impact beyond .
I was a week later , there was a problem with the car , to these blind here -- these blubs here -- these blumers .
These fili are going to 3,000 print when the car works .
Now , the technical technical between you will look at the fili and say , " It 's not true . I 'm flights too much . "
And they can do it because when I 'm very freedom to become the superconstruct .
So , at least 271 degrees , at least 271 degrees , these files can bring that rate that rate .
In one of the giuntures between the most novemile in the LHC , there was a fabric of fabababsolutely .
So the file you can get a slightly , and the 13,000 print print , and 13,000 print .
This was the result .
Now , this is still more impressive if you think that these magnetic weight than 20 tons , and that you 've been moving about 30 centimeters .
They are damage about 50 magnetes .
We had to take them , what we did .
We restinated and travel .
Now are now going to be recenter .
I mean , the end of the LHC will be again .
We 'll get it , and we 'll expect to get to get data or the right right right , and continuing our adventure to discover what are the morning is that they 're the morning that are the morning that are the morning that are the morning that are the morning that are the morning that are the morning , and we 'll go to get the universe .
Now , of course , in a certain way , these accidents return the debate of the value of science and engineering ering in front of science and engineering in front of science and engineering . It 's easy to do .
I think the fact that 's so hard , the fact of going to go beyond the value of things like LHHC .
I would like to conclude with a English , Humphrey David , Humphrey David , which , imagine , in difense of the inuseful experiments of its own own own own own own own , and he said , " Niest is so dangerous , who are definitive , which is a lot of science of the ideas of the science of the human mind , which is not a mysteries in nature , which is a lot of our triond .
Thank you .
I want to start to start thinking about when children , children playing up with children , players .
Whereas you understand how to reach them , and you get them , and you know , learn , you know , you know , actually , you know , and you know , and we 're going to do space .
The space-spactation is deeply connected to the way we understand the world around us .
So , from the useful of our interaction with physical objects , together to my consulent , with my consulent of the Jeevan Kalanithi , and I started to ask ask , " And if we use a computer , and I started to have the mouse , we 're going to have only a hour , we could be a bunch of the mouse , we could be able to be able to be a sle-walk with a bright hour hour ,
and sistly it to our please ?
The question was so interesting that we decided to explore the answer , and building the answer , which is building the Siftable .
In a few words , a Siftable computer is a whole computer interactive , as a biscope .
In a few words , a Siftable computer is a whole computer interactive , as a biscope .
You can move with your hand , they can see , " between them , " between them , " between them , " and they have a screen and a radio wireless .
But sostantly , they are physical objects , as the morning , you can move to be able to be able to just race .
The Siftable is the example of a new ecosystem to manipulate the information of the digital information .
And as they 're going to become more physical , knows of the other , and other , and and as they become more physical , and what 's going to become more physical , and other than how we can explore ore new and different styles of interaction .
I 'm going to do with some simple example .
This Siftable is configurate to show you of the video : if you put it in a direction , video rate , the video rich , the video , so if you put on the other side .
These interactive reactive reactive .
If you 're doing them , they 're interested in what they 're around .
If they 're circumsted , they can do it .
If they 're circumsted , they can do it .
They also have their movement and inlination .
We then realized that one of the interaction was that one of the interaction was able to use the data , to example , " a color like , " a color like if it was a liquid .
In this case , we have three Siftable configurate as a severnice and I can use them to the color , where you put them to the central , where you put it .
and I can use them to the color in the central , where you 're missing .
If we 're too too , we can get a little bit of place .
I 'm also beautiful possibilities of the apprice , like language , the mathematics and games where people can try to try to get things that quickly , and you can see the results of the immediately .
Now I 'm --
This is a Fibonacks that I do with a program of equations .
Here we have a game of words that 's half a bit of words that 's half the charges and Boboble .
Pratically , at every turn-and-up letter , Pratically , at every turnal turnnake , at every turnnake , and as you look at any of the sorts of words of compories .
Then , about 30 seconds are remissing , and you have a new labs of reading and new possibilities to try .
Thank you .
Here 's how children came to the Media Lab , I did it in a way that I tried to try and I went to a video .
They have a lot of them .
And one of the things of this application is that not to have to give people many education .
You 've got to say , " Compon words , and they know exactly what do .
Here 's how many people who are trying to do .
This is our young engineer , there 's a younger , there on the right right .
It was actually wanted to do it .
They 're only morning in the morning , for him .
Now , this is a application of a interactive carton .
We wanted to build a tool for the apprment of language . He 's got to build a lot .
It can insert new characters in the scene , and they 're going to be able to associated .
It can insert new characters in the scene , and they 're going to be able to associated .
And that 's going to use the sun .
Video : The sun is source .
David Merrill : Now he took a treat in the scene .
Video : The treat treat .
Bel work ! Yeah !
So , you get the Siftable and you can interact the characters --
Video : Bau !
-- inventing your story .
Video : Hao !
DM : It 's a story with the open , and it can decide how you get .
DM : It 's a story with the open , and it can decide how you get .
Video : Very good .
DM : The last example I have to show you is a tool , I realized , to camp and exeguing music .
It 's a tool , made of recently , to camp and exeguing music .
The Siftable here are aging from sound as the bottom and bacteria .
Each one of these have four different variations , and you can get to use .
You can also put these sutions in a sequence from comporing to a compories .
And you 're going to just take a suit , and a sequence . "
These are actually , you can control from the vial , like the reverbero and the filter .
The attacks to a particular , and then inclabor to travel .
And then there are the general effects as time and fly , that 's going to be sequence .
We look at how it works .
Video : We 're going to get a bottom in two Siftable sequence , we 're going to put in a series , we put in a series , we add the way we add .
Now I put a bottom line .
Video : Now I add percussions --
Video : And now I 'm going to put the phild to bacteria , so I can control the effect from the vial .
Video : I can be fall the intera pitch of the way or another .
Video : And now I 'll add the bottom to give the bottom to give more expression .
Video : I can recombine sequence the sequence of the flight .
So I don 't have to plan it before , but I can improvisit , and make it fer or the most corner .
And now , finally , I can spend the whole sequence , the whole bunch on the Sifly , " volume . "
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is to build new interfaces as the more and more sound as they work as our brain and body .
And today , I had time to show you one of the result of this , and also some chance we try to take out of the lab .
The concept I want to get to get to is that new generation of designed designed designed to interact with digital media , that will take information in our world in the way we want to do .
Thank you very much .
I don 't see the herself now to talk to all you .
I 'm a writing .
I 'm going to be books is the profession , but it 's more than that , of course .
It 's also love and the fashion and the fashion of my life .
And I don 't expect that you can change .
But , said , this is something happened in my life and in my life and in my career , which has taken me to recently recently the interor report with this work .
The particular thing is that I 've written this book , this biography called " Mangia , Prega , Ama , " which is what I was going to diversity from my books , for some reason used in the world and become a great feelational , bestler .
And the result is that anywhere to go now , people are treatment like if I was constructed .
It 's true -- you know , you know , you know ,
They 're going to be now for me , and they say , " You have no fear to do ?
You have no fear to continue to writing for all life without to create a book that can be able to create a book that can be able to make someone ? "
which can be important to someone ? "
It 's rassurance , you know .
But it could go worse , at the time I remember that I remember , when I started to say , I was a writer , when I started to say -- I was a writer -- I wanted to be a writer .
I was going to stay for the same reaction .
And people said , " Do you don 't have to do it ?
You don 't have fear that the million of the refight killed you ?
You have no fear to do this mestize for all life without anything about it comes and dead to die on a cure , and to die on a moon of a dreaming in the movement of failure ? "
So , you know .
The answer -- the short answer to all these questions is , " Yeah . "
Yeah , I spend all of those things .
I always had fear .
And I also have a lot of other things that people can 't income to income .
As the algae and other things spent .
But , as as about the writing what I thought and I would say last midly , why ?
Is it rational ?
It 's logical logical that anyone who has been expected by a job that you know , you know , I 've been born to do .
But what is that 's so particular in the impress of creative , and creative nervous , and it 's about the mental health of a way that other carrier than other carrier .
How father , for example , he was a chemical engineer and not remember one time in his 40 years of activity where he was asked if they were asked if they were going to be engineer ?
It was never -- that block of engineer John , how does it happen ?
It wasn 't working on that , right ?
Onestly , the engineers like group have not certainly , in the seual seful , wild the reputation of being alcolized maniacated .
We have enough to be a reputation , and not only scritten , but creativous of every kind of , we have this reputation of being huge instainable to be huge instainable .
And it 's not to look at the triad of the deaths of the magnifments of the magnifments of the century , they die young and often for them .
And even those who are not suicians seem to be really disappeared by their dones .
Norman Mailer , before , in the last interview , in the last interview said , " Each my book , " Each my book , " Each my book , I 'm going to do a little bit more .
But we don 't blink when we heard these things , because we 've heard these things so long , we 've been interiorized and accepted the notion that creativity and accepted the notion that creativity and the art , in some way that you read and art , and it will always get to go to the ants .
And the question I want to take all today is : you 're agree with this idea ?
It 's good for you -- because you look at a centimeter of distance to me not good for anything .
I think it 's odious .
And I think it 's also dangerous and I don 't want to see the next century .
I think it 's better to encouraging our big creative minus .
And I know , in my case -- in my case -- in my case -- it would be very dangerous to start fuse that I hear support to be able to be able to start with the circircircircircircircircircircumstances where I 'm in my career .
It 's true -- you look at least -- I 'm pretty young , I have about 40 years .
I still have about four decades of work in me .
And it 's very likely that anything I written in the world as the work that I used to do this succeful , as the work that was done after I spent my last book .
I 'm going to go to , because we 're all more or less friends here -- is that my greatest success is to my spent .
Oh , Gesus , who thought !
You know , this is the kind of thought that leads to start bate in the morning of the morning and I don 't want to do it .
I would continue to continue to do this work .
So , the question is it , how ?
And so I think , after many reflessions , that the way to work to continue to writing is to create a psychologic costroke , OK ?
I have to find a way of security in me , which I 'm writing , and my natural natural natural anxime , which is that writing , and I was trying to find out of how to do that we start looking through time , and I try to find other society to see if you could have the best ideas and more sane and more sane to see if they could have the best ideas and more sane to see if you could have the best ideas and more sane and more sane .
to help people believe the inerent people to do inerent inerent response .
And that research has taken me to the Grek and antics Rome .
I 'm going to go to me because I 'm giant and then back .
In the ancient Grek and ancient Rome -- people don 't seem to believe that creativity came to men , OK ?
And it was thought that creativity was this spirit look at the men and that came to men from a few people distant , and knowledge , for reasons and knowledge .
The green were called these spirites of creativity .
You look at , wonderful , he was believed to have a demon that elareas from far away .
The Roands were the same idea , but they call that species without a genius .
The big is , because Rohands don 't think about a genius was a genius was a smart .
They think that a genius was this species of a devine , which was actually living in the murs of a artist , a little bit like the Abbbaby , a little bit like the baby of artist argument , and it was going to play the work of the argument of the artist and models the job .
Eththemotional -- here is the distance of which is the distance of the psychologic psychologic that you protects you from your work .
And they all knew that was so that was what was doing , right ?
So , the artists were protected by certain things , like for example , the way too narcisive narcisive narcisive , no ?
If your work was excited to you , you can 't get all the deserve , all of course , they all knew that people had been helped by this genius .
If your work failure , it was not all cold , right ?
And they all knew that was your genius to be a incapable .
And so people han conceived creativity in Occient .
And then the Rinascition came and all changed , and nacque this big idea ; we put the human being in the middle of the universe on all the misters and the mysteries and without leleaving space .
This was the principle of humanesimum and people started thinking about creativity and creativity came to think creativity came up with ilify .
And for the first time in history , you 're going to refert to this or that artist as a genius of a kind of a genius of genius .
And I have to say , I think that was a big error mistake .
I think you lose someone , a simple person to believe that as a reciplent as a reciplent as a fource as a recil , and the surprise of all the mysteries , creativable and etheternal is a very big fix that human beyellow .
It 's how to ask someone to ingoal .
It shape and demand demand all these ingestify expectations on the performance .
And I think it was this pression to have been in 500 years old old .
And if that 's true , and I think that 's the question is , and now ?
Can we do that .
I get back to a more antical comprey of human relationship between humans and mystery creative .
Or maybe no .
Maybe we can 't have 500 years old thinking about 500 years of thinking in a 118 minutes .
And there are people between the audience that would read the scientific subjects on the notion of , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , people would be able to do .
I 'm not going to convinced you all about this thing .
But the question I 'd like to take is -- why no ?
Why don 't I think about this way ?
Because it 's more sense of anything that ever heard to explain the imprevedibility of the creative process .
A process that , as anybody who ever tried to do something -- so , all of this -- so , all here -- you don 't know .
And , in fact , you can sometimes seem to be completely parankorry .
I did this inagainst recently , Ruth Stone , who has 90 years , but he was a poetry for all of life and he said that during his childhood and he said that during his childhood , and he was working on the fields , and he was working on the fields , and he was going to hear , inside the ball of the time .
He said that was as a frageful train .
And that was getting rotoling to her from the landscape .
He felt it , because he had to be able to get the land under its feet .
He knew that point to have one thing to do , and it was of , he was , he walk like a match . "
And so he goes back to home and it was going to be able to get a piece of card and a matter of a card and a match and a match and a match of a cymit and a supply stick , and he would take the page .
And then , I couldn 't get enough to be fast , so he goes and correcreceive and correcreceived in home and the poetry , and he had to go through and she had to go through the landscape , and he would continue to go through the landscape , and he would continue to go through the landscape , and he would continue to go through the land-up and he would continue to get to get in home and the back and he would continue to go home and the back and he would continue to go home and the bodidididi
And then there were the times -- this piece of not dementichy -- there were the moments where was almost losing , OK ?
So , he was going to go home and he was trying to get a major , and he was trying to get a math in the time , and he said , what he was going to go , and then he said , what if you go to do with each other hand and the step .
He was a little bit of the poetry and the reputting in his body and transcutting it on the page .
And in these cases , the poetry would be presented on the perfect page and intact but the last word to the last word .
So when I hear you think about -- it 's just just a lot of my creative process .
Not all my creative process -- I 'm not a cycle .
I 'm a mud , and my way to work is ; you know , you know , you know , and I 'm going to work and go on and go down to the herself .
But even I have a lot of my testing , I 've been carry against that thing , sometimes .
And I imagine that many of you have han .
You know , even though the job and ideas came to a certain source you can 't be source , you know , I can 't know .
And what is that ?
And how do we do it in a way to do it , but rather , what do you do , but rather , what do you do ?
And as I 'm about , the best example of the time I have been the Mounder Waits , which I interviewed a day .
We were talking about this , and you know , Tom , for the majority of life was the incarnation of the artist towwrote , trying to control , to start to control , dominate these species of impults .
But then invecting , and he was driving , and a day as he was driving on a Teeeway , changed everything for him .
He was going to go fast and everything from a tract . This little fragement of melodia , which is coming in in his head as a inspiration , and it 's going to , you know , it 's wonderful , and you know , it 's wonderful and the desider , but it 's not like to take it .
It 's not a piece of card , it has no matter , it has no registrator .
So I started to hear this species of old old old old old old , and I 'm going to lose , and I 'm going to remarrate , and I 'm going to sessionate by this song .
I don 't have enough . "
And instead of going to go to the panic ,
I 'm going to be a whole new .
I 'm going to look at the sky and said , " Scuses , you know , you know , I 'm not guiding ? "
" You know that 's going to write a song ?
If you really want to existing , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you really want to be .
And you go to importantly quality .
I went to disturban Leonard Cohen . "
And his process of changes after that .
It 's not the work , the job was still obvious as .
But the process , and the fish was releaving it was releaved when he took the genius , the genius that was going to get back to where the genius , and it was going to go back from where it was going to be a whole thing and it was going to be a whole thing and it was going to be a whole thing and then then .
but you know , this is a wonderful bizarra , wonderful bizarra , a conversation between Tom and this thing that was not Tom .
So how I felt that story to change a little bit even the way I was working , and I was always save me and I was save me and I 've got to save me .
This idea , I was saving when I was writing " Mangia , " and I , " and I 'm going to be able to one of those cave the disperation that we 're doing when we 're working on something and we 're going to think that will be a disaster , which is going to be the worst book written .
Not only good , right , right the worst book written .
And I started thinking about this project .
But then I remember Tom that I talked to the air and I tried to .
So I went to the wild and I got my face on the wild and I got my common ,
And I said to get voices , " Surch , what , you 're going to be brilliant not going to be able to be interested in , no ?
Because as I see you know , I 'm going to get all that I have , I have no more than that .
So if you want to be better , you have to show you and do your part .
Okay . But if you don 't do it , you know what , I don 't do anything .
I 'm going to write to write the same because it 's my work .
And I want to favor that was registrated that I 've been presented to do my part of the " because -- finally , OK -- I 'm so , OK -- -- they 're doing in the desert of the north Africa of the danances and sacra that they went on to the wild and the hand-up , and the music ,
And they were always magnify because the ballerins were professionals and were great .
But every long , rarely , something happened , and one of these artists become a lot of these artists become transcutterly transcender .
And I know what you know , because I know that you 've all seen , at a performance , a performance so .
It was as if you stick , and the ballerine walked through a ball of the way and not doing anything else from the solute , as the 1,000 night before , but everything is all the 1,000 night before , but everything is all all you know .
And at the improvious not look at as a human .
But it 's accese to the diet and down to the divinity of the divinity .
And when this happened , you know , the people knew what was , they were called it .
They were going to get your hands and they started to dotar , " Allah , Allah , God God , God , God God , God , God God , God God , God , God , God God , " God , " God , " God , " God , " God , " God , " God , " God , " God , " God , " God , God , God , " God God , " God God , God God God God , God God , God , God , God , God , God , God , God , God , God , God ,
That 's God , you know .
I was recently nice -- when More More invaser the Spain , I was this abitude with them and the pronoundation changes in the middle of Allah , Allah , Allah , Allah , " Ollah , you can still hear in the courager or the flamp .
In Spain , when a artist did something impossible and magic , " Allah , Allah , Allah , I was , brand , I was , " incompreed , that 's a last thing .
And it 's great because we need .
But , the problem comes the day after , for the ballerine , when you know , and discover that are the 11 morning of Martedday and the morning and last God is no more .
It 's just a mortal with gran bad leg , and maybe you can 't get more to make it up to the altel .
And maybe nobody will be the name of God , and what does it have to do with the rest of his life ?
It 's hard .
This is one of the most pathful recognize to make a creative life .
But maybe not to be so aneous if you can 't believe , if you can 't believe , and now , that 's more extraordinary than you are being from you .
But you 're just going to have to be data in prestiping from a inimaginable source of this team of your life that you have to go out to something else when you finished .
And , you know , if we think about this everything changes .
And so I started thinking about , and it 's sure as I thought about a few months in the work of the book that I 'm going to be in the pericolost , the dangerous , I 'm going to attention my big succeful .
And what I have to continue to continue when I feel that is , not have fear .
It 's not to just your work .
You can be .
If your work is bally , ball .
If you go to the wine , I would like to leave you a little bit of a wonderful time , for a moment through your short , then , " Ole . "
I got to do it .
And " Ole ! " You know , you know .
I think , and I think you have to teach it .
" Ole ! " You know , " only for having human love , even for having our human lives and testing tareas as as a representing .
Thank you .
Thank you .
June Cohen : Ole !
As you know I 've been talking about some of these projects on the human genome , about what can mean and discovery of the discovery .
We 're starting a new percourse : we started digitalize biology and now now now to digital biology and now now now we 're both going to a new phase of biology , designing and synthetizing life .
We always tried to take a lot of questions .
" What is life ? " It 's something that many biologists have taught to understand vary vary vary vary .
We tried different approach , reduced to the minimum .
We 're digitizero-year .
When we sequenced the human genome was treated to go from the world of the digital world .
Now we ask : we can regenerate life , or to create new life from this digital universe ?
This is the map of a small organism , Mycoplasm , which is the species from the genome of the genome of the most small genome of the lab of the lab .
And we tried to reduce the genome for creating genome for creating a little bit more .
We 're able to eliminate a hundred genes of genes about 500 .
But when we look at its mapolic map , it 's relatively simple than our .
I think of that .
But when we look at all the genes that we can get , one of the time , it 's very improbable that this can bring a living cells .
So we decided that the only forth to progreed to progree this chromosoma in a way to be able to be able to be able to components to take some of these fundamental questions .
And so we started the adventure of " Can we can synthesize a chromosoma ? "
It can be able to make these big molecules that we never had to do that ?
And in case of the way , we can make a chromosoma ?
A chromosoma is just a piece of chemical material .
The speed with which we are going to digitalize life is growing up to the exponential life is growing .
Our capacity to write the genetic code , instead of progree , but it 's going to be better .
And our most recent requiet our fall on a curve .
We started more than 15 years ago .
The process of the process has required to a biothetic reviewed before we start with the first experiments .
But we found that synthesize DNA is very hard .
There are tens of thousands of cars in the world that product , and the long , of the long , and it 's a degenerative process : the most miles are going to be , more mistaining , more errors are .
So we had to develop a new method to assembling these framework and correcrect the mistakes .
And this was our first tentative tack-information information of the genome of the genome of the genome of the genome of the genome of the genome of the genome of the genome of the genome of the genome of the genome of the genome of the genome of the genome
It 's a little virus that kills .
We designed the fragments , effective the correction of the mistainessor , and get a molecule of about 5,000 lectary leck .
The thing is interesting is when we took this piece of chemical material , and we put it in bacteria , bacteria have initial , and we 've got to read this genetic code and proud the particles .
The viral particles have then been reduced by cell , they 're back and they have destroyed the E.
I talked about recent recently with the oil industry , and they 're trying to do that model .
They have re-fall .
We think that 's a situation where the software can actually build its same hardware in a biological system .
But we wanted to do things in big big .
We wanted to build the entire chromosoma .
They 're more than 580 mile lecting .
So we thought we 've been building in casses of the size , so we can change the casss of the virus , so that you can change the casses of a living cells .
The design is crucial , and if we start with digital information in a computer , these have to be very accurate .
When we sequenced this genome for the first time in 1995 , the movail was a supply for every 10 mile .
We found , 30 mistake , 30 mistaining , 30 mistaining that sequence never been able to do it .
One part of the process is designing , and 50 labor that you 're subvance with all other segments of 50 lecting to build substand with all the other segments of them working together .
We have a unique elements here .
You probably read that you have a lot of the filify .
Think of course , we have a genetic code on four leck , C , C , C , GDDs and T.
Three of those letters together , they 're going to do , and there 's a specific order of the mobile , and there 's a specific order to expected every fris .
So we can use genetic code for write , frases .
What we did at the beginning is autograped to do it .
Some of them were being being in by fact that it wasn 't .
We designed these segments for a few years , just just to get up with the enabms .
There are essentially income and put them them .
And we started assemble with segments , starting with segments from five to seven miles to seven miles , unending to give them to a bunch of 24 miles to get to 72 miles .
And we 've got these segments in abond , so that we 're trying to make a very straight approach to create a very robustoking , as you 'll see in a minute .
We 're trying to automatize the process .
So , this seems to be a board of a bottom of bottom .
When we get these very long , the most 100 miles , the most 100 miles , they 're not going to grow up in the E.
It 's going to be the modern of the molecular biology .
So we looked at other mechanisms .
We knew about another mecchanism called omologogogogoga , which in biology , in biology , which in biology to repair the segments .
Here 's an example .
This organism , called Deinococture , can absors three million rates in radiooococture .
You can see in the sound of the sound as its chromosoma comes down .
In 12 -- 24 hours is reabsolutely reached as it was before .
They 're going to be thousands of organisms that are able to do it .
These organisms can sitting at completely .
They can live in a vacuum .
I 'm absolutely sure that life existing in space , and you know , to find new environments of water .
And in the real , NASA showed that this is .
This is a image of molecule that we 've built out of these processes , just using the baby design , to insert design , to insert .
The lights is self-assemble .
This image is not been taken with a electronic microscope , but with a microscope .
It 's a molecule that we can see the whole with a little bit of a little bit .
These are photo covered a period of six seconds .
This is the advertising that we did a long time ago .
They 're more than 580,000 lecting .
It 's the largest molecule of a defined structure .
It 's a molecular weight to 300 million million .
If you stamp it with a caratter to 10 without spaces , you would like to get 142 page to transformer this .
Now , how do we do it ?
Of course , you know , a virus is a bottom of kids .
It 's a little more complicated when you use the bacteria .
It 's simply simple when it 's the eucariods like our own , you can just be able to get the nucleo and inseriron , which is basically the process of clond .
In the bacteria is the chromosoma is , but we 've recently demonstrated that we are able to do a birthday , but we have recently demonstrate that we are able to do a cell that 's a cell cell to another and active cell .
We 've got a cromosoma , by a kind of microbial species .
The two are different as the men from the topes .
We added some gene in the more way to decide what to do for this chromosoma .
And then I 'm going to kill all the proin a way to kill all the proins .
And when we put it in the cell was study -- and you 'll appreciate our graphical graphics -- the new chromom -- the new chromom is going to inside the cell .
And we were really thinking that we couldn 't go beyond , but we tried to spinger us in there .
This is one of the major mecchanisms .
We found that a second , and we added a second or a third chromosoma from some of a thousand new tracks to a second thousand new tracks to that species .
So who think about evolution as a gene and at the time you have to be a gene and it has not understand grandard .
They 're going to be essentially called " enjoy restripping the DNA .
The chromosoma that was in the cell doesn 't have one .
The cell phone , and the cell cell that we have inserito--one .
It 's expressed , and he recognize the other chromosoma as material , has masticated , and we 've got to get the cell and the new cell and the new cell .
It 's become blue because of genes we 've got inserted .
And in a short leep , all the characteristics of a species are going to be lose , and it has transformed in a new species , based on the new software that we put in in the cell .
All the proin the proin the proteins have changed , and when we read the genetic code , and when we read the genetic code , exactly what we have spred .
Now , this could look at alchmy genetics , but altering software , we can change things in a kind of substants .
Now , I 've already explain that there is not talking about genesespecially -- but I 've been starting to three million years and a half years and a half of evolution , and I said that maybe we 're going to create a new version of the Cambrian extraordinary new species on this process .
Why do that ?
I think it 's enough to be obvious when we think our necessity .
We 're going to go from six billion and a half billion in the next 40 years in the next 40 years .
Right to give an example : I was born in 1946 .
Now there are three people on the planet for each existing in 1946 ; in 40 years , there are going to be four .
We 're getting problems now to find food , water and a lot of food , medical and benefits and benefits and a half billion and a half of people .
It 's going to be more than billion .
We 're going to be more than five billion carbon , 30 billion baries , 30 billion baries .
And that means is cent millions of baries in day .
When I try to find biologists or any kind of process to get them , it 's going to be a huge challenge .
We have to recognize all the emission of CO2 from these materials that 's going to end in the atmosphere .
And at the day , because of the scientific discoveries in all the world , we have a database with about 20 million genes , and I like to think that are designed for the future .
The electronic industry is just a dozen about components , and think about how much different things are coming out .
Our limits here are data here , and our imagination .
Now we have techniques , because of these rapid metods synthetization , in order to create what we call genomics .
We 're able to build a big robot that can produce a million crumosomes on a day .
Think about the 20 million genes or trial to try to get to get to get to get either , new vaccines , and we can change , and we can change , we can change , we can change , because of a little team , and create more biology now in the last 20 years of science .
And it 's just a standard selection .
We can choose for survival , production , chemical production or carburant , production of vaccines .
This is an instantaneous instantanea of software program that we 're working for seats and designing species of computers .
Well , we don 't know how to be .
We know exactly how genetic code .
So we 're going to footage on the fourth of the fourth generation .
You 've seen you that you can extend to extend d the gram was a finished experiment .
We have carburant , the third generation that are going to use enough to be the highest carburant as the either either , as the otherwise or different type of butanol .
But the only way that biology can have a big impact without increasing the cost of food and limit the cost of food and limit would be transforming the CO2 in matter before , for which we 're working on design cells that we 're working for designing cells that can reach , and we think we can have first first carbon .
The solar solar solar with CO2 is a metodo-- but in our discovery , in our discovery .
This is a organism that we 've described in 1996 .
It 's about 2500 feet of the ocean , about 2500 feet of the temperature of the water .
They think they 're using the CO2 using molecular as a source as a source of energy .
We 're trying to understand if we can incanalate CO2 , which can do it be transformed to be transformed to be transformed to the CO2 in carbon , to guiding this process .
So , we 're going to be able to increase what 's about to increase what 's life is , " which is Nookay , " which is Noobial , we know -- we have the modth of the intera oil industry .
Exxxture . If you don 't do that ?
It would be a main of energy .
And we 're working on the same metods to to create vaccines .
You 've seen this year with influence , we 're always going to go back and a dollar in less when it 's getting a dollar .
I think you can change it in a combinable combinable to antician .
And that 's how the future could start looking at the time , the tree of evolution , accelling evolution with bacteria , you know , archy , you know , archy , and infinally cell .
We are so much from the best to improve people .
Our discovery is to do it in a long way to live enough to try to do it . Thank you very much . Thank you very much .
First of all , I 'll do it , the fast ast , a new job , of the new technology that we took Microsoft , and the new technology that we took a year . This is . This is Seadragon . This is Seadragon .
It 's a environment where you can interact is to local level that you can interact with a huge amount of data data .
So we 're seeing a lot of digital photos with a photos with a kind of photoom and continuous , for a fast fast , and we have the images as we want .
And not matter how big it 's the amount of information that we see , how big these things are big data or images .
Most of the digital photographs , but this for example is a prostate of this , for example is a prostate of the Congress , and reenter in the gams of 300 megaxel .
It doesn 't have a difference because the only thing that limit is the number of a system like this is the number of pixel on your screen in any time . It 's also a very fflessible architecture .
This is a book , of the whole book , for example of data not images .
This is Casa desolate . Each colonna represented a capol .
And to show you that 's about the text and not images , we can do something like that , to see that is a real real representation of the tape of the text , not a picture .
It could be a way artificial to read a wild in a book .
It 's not about it .
This is a more realistic example . It 's a number of the Looks .
Each image age is the beginning of a seition .
And you really have to be like to read and the beautiful experience of a spective , or a review or a quotidian , which is for nature , which is for a mold of a a lot of a half a lot .
We also did something with the angle of this , in particular , of the Look .
We 've created a fashion to the higher , and it 's more than what you use in a normal advertising , and we put you in the content .
If you want to see the characteristics of this automobile , you can see here .
Or other models , or even the specific specific models .
And this really demonstrate some of these ideas for eliminate space .
We hope that that this means to do that , you know , you know , and other porcheries , you don 't have to be necessary .
Of course , the map is one of the most applications and for this kind of technology .
And on this this is not going to lose time , if we don 't have contribute to give us to this field .
These are all the street in the U.S. subvil of NASA .
So now we go to something else .
This is actually actually what I live on the web ; you can go to see .
It 's a project called Photosynth , which combine two different technologies .
One is Seadragon and the other is a visual computer in the computer computer , in the U.K. . I was a student of the University of Washington , with help of Steve Seitz of the Microsoft Rick Seitz .
And it 's from the wind , I 'm going to be wild .
You can see it when we do this kind of screen , where we can spend up to the other image and have this kind of experience to the multiple .
But the spaced of the spaces of images here has actually a significant .
The algorithms of the computer , have recorded these images together , so that you have been going to corresponrespond to places where you imagine reimagine -- all the scary of the Montagne Roccious , you 're going to go to the Montagne Rococcious , you 're going to be scary or the blind of a imagining imagining , and these things are all connected to spspactation .
I don 't know if I have time to show you some other environment .
And there are some more spaces .
I want to spend directly to one of the original data of Noahhhhhhahhhsynthoks that we 've done to work for the first time , I 'll do this first time time , to show you what that we 've been doing this very close is , the technology Photosynthy . And it 's not necessarily obvious , we put in the webb .
We had to worry about the legal and forth .
This is a re-construction of Notter , and you 're going to be a digitear . Bastic digitchchchchchchchchchcheap , and you get images of these things in magic . And you get a lot of these constructs a picture that is discovery is discovery , discovery , the other of these conts represents a picture that .
So I 'm all images in Flickr and they 're all connected to this .
And it 's possible to navigate in this simply simple way .
You know , I would never have to end work for Microsoft .
It 's very gratifying to get this kind of accooking here .
I think you can see that 's a lot of different type of totools : where you have these phones to those professional professional , a number of meaning , a meananing , put together in this environment .
And if you can , I try to try and more strange .
Many are blogged by doing .
And then , there 's some of photographs -- it 's a series of photographs -- it 's a lot of photographs -- it 's a few photographs -- it .
This is a poster of Nototh Dame registrate .
We can go from the poster to the physical view of this environment .
The essential point is that we can do with social environment . This is now taking data from the intera collective memory of how to be able to be able to as the interine to be able to as a visual view -- and connected all those data together together together .
All those pictures become connected together , larger than the sum of the parts .
You have a model of the entire land that emerges .
Think about the work of Stephen Lawler on Earth 's work .
It 's something that grow in complexity as people use , and the advantages for who are using them , and the advantages of the use .
Their pictures are hushed with other people .
If you get the idea of contrast to get all these things , and the name of the name , my photo to Notter Din improvised , and I can use how to do all those data data , and I can use how to do you get to get to the scale of the space , and I can use a photo to to a photo to be able to be able to use a kind of cross-mountain .
Of course , a consequence of everything are virtual models of any interesting things of the land , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , and from images and similar images and similar images and similar images and similar images and similar images and similar images and similar imaginitial imaginner .
Milles .
Chris Anderson : I realized ? What your software is that your software will have to do is that to do is that to a certain point in the next years , all photography , all photographs , all photographs , and they share they going to be practically connected together ?
BAA : Yeah . What 's doing is doing is actually discover .
It 's creating the lolink , if you want , you to be in images .
And it 's doing it in the content to the images .
The thing is become very interesting if you think about recheality , you know , you know , you know , you know ,
As you have a research research on the web , you have a phrase and the text on the web page on the web page .
Now , what happens if that picture is you connected to all your photo ?
So the amount of interconnection and the amount of semantics and the amount of rcheese is really huge . It 's a classic effect of the network .
CA : Blaise , it 's really amazing .
BAA : I 'm going to be very much .
One of the most likest time when you travel and one of the deliium of the research is that we can live in in the wind , who has been able to live in the wind , and you have the past in the wind , you have the spent in the wind , you know , you know , the spent the spring of the plants , and the legs of the plants , and you have to sell the spread .
Basti think of the monkeys Jaguar travel , and the Via Lattea , or that the monitites of the Inuit are still color , or that in Himalaya , the budddists still the respier of the most anthropology , and the world that the central , which is the world 's going to live in in a sense , but it 's just a model , but it 's just a model , but it 's a lot of reality , but it 's just a model ,
the consequence of a particular set of choices that our stypes has done , well , many generations ago .
And , of course , we all share the essential traits .
We all have to prove .
We are subject to start .
We have to do to get the inexorability of death , so we don 't surprising if we 're going to do .
We all have an art .
What is that you want to be particular , the rithythm of every culture .
It 's not not matter that are the Penan ank-wrote , or the Wodoo , or the Waiti , or the Waiti , or the Wab Kenya , or the Candenya in Kenya , or a smol in the Cander of the Ande , or a camp in the heart of the Sahara .
He was my journey in the desert a month ago , or a month ago , or a a alevil in the values of Qomolanger , on Everest , the deaths of the world .
All these populations are teaching us that are other ways of thinking about , other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking about , other ways of moving in the world .
And if you reflect a second , is a concept that can give you hope .
Insidies , the myries of cultures of the world create a spiritual life of the planet , cultural , which is important for benbe of the planet and is important for benbe of the planet as biosphere .
And you can think about this cultural ragnosphere , as a thetnosphere and you can definire the exhic of all concepts , dreams , all , inspiration , inspirations , inspirations , inspiration , inspiration , inspiration ,
The etnosphere is the wonderful patriage of humanity .
It 's the symbol of what we are and what we can be in how inquisitive .
And as the biosphere was a lot of fer , it was made up to the etnosphere and unfortunately , and it 's very quickly fast .
Nobody biologist , for example , that 's 50 percent of all species is on the ord of the exintion , because it 's fairly in the exinted , but it 's in the most apocalm of biological diversity -- and you can 't even close to the most powerful diversity .
And the indict of all , of course , the language .
When you 're born to be 6,000 languages on this planet .
One language is not just composite by a vocabolary or a series of rules .
One language is the human spirit of human spirit .
It 's the middle with the animum of every culture comes in the material world .
Each language is a forest of mind , a back-thinking , a thought , a thought , a spiritual possibilities .
And of those 6,000 languages , as we are here to Monterey , at least the half not is more sucked in the orches of children .
They don 't get to teach children , which means , not that check , which is not not , you know , what 's already death .
What is there 's more triad of being aved by the silence , of being the last to talk , of the last to talk , of not to get to get the saggeous to anticipate the saggeous of the children ?
This was a few weeks , and a few weeks . every two weeks : every two weeks , and a half weeks , and a muor , with a advantical language .
And I know someone who 's not better .
The world would not be a better place if we 're talking about the same language ? " Benissim , then we all talk ? " We all talk about yoruba . We talk to talk to the dotonese .
We talk about kogi .
You 'll be able to be able to say , you can 't talk about your language .
I 'd like like to do you to do a journey through the etnosphere --
a little journey in the etnosphere to give you a kind of what we 're lost .
Many of us are deal that when I say , " different ways of existing , but I mean different ways of existing .
We take for example , this bimbo Barasan Amazon Amazon , popular , popular , the popular of the anacond of the anacond of the smoon of the saconest in the pants of the sackers .
It 's a popular popular that is not able to distinguess the blue color , because the time you 're identify in the forest time , which is identify .
They have a strange language and a major , he said , " examples , " You have to tell you a different person who talks about a different person who talks about a different language .
All it has been in the past mitological , but it 's in these families extent is that in these families extent in these families extent where you are in these families as well as a language .
They 're limited to listen and then start talking .
We take one of the most interesting tribes with the most interesting tribes that I lived , Waoran nural , a popular popular that had the first contact in 1958 .
In 1957 five missionary , they 've been tented a construct construct .
They did that the high photographs that they were reversus that they were reaching them in the forest of the forest forest .
They collect the picture of the land , they have to go to the research or a shape , or a shape , and they 're not going to come up with the dieth , and they killed the five missionary with the lain .
But the Waorani doesn 't kill the strange .
They kill them in .
54 percent of the mortality was caused by their own own .
We 're srisk to eight generations and we found two cases of natural death and when we 've been reached to know that one of them was invecting a lot of them was inveck , and then they killed it .
The crugs were able to recognize the animal of 40 step and recognize the species .
In the first ' 80 , I was assigned a really interesting compask when my professor Harvard , if I wanted to go to Havard , if I wanted to go to Haiti to go into the society of Duvalier and Tonton Macouvalier and Tonton Macoucouvalized .
To give a sense of miracerous myth , I should understand the Vodoo , which is not magnine .
It 's pretty much about a complex metaphical vision of the world .
Many interesting .
If I asked you to tell me the big religions of the world , what do you ?
Cristianesimum , Islam , Buddism , Ebraism , etc .
A continent is always leaving out , thinking that Africa has not been feed to religious , and that 's not going to be any other distild of these concepts . And that 's not another one that the distild of these religious concepts in the skills .
What 's interesting to make the voodoo is the intest interest between life and death .
So the vision is to the spirites .
The spirites can be invoced by Grande Acqua , respond to the rhythm of the dance and you replace to the vial soul of the vial way that 's going to a short a short kind of active ,
And so the voodooodoers are going to say , " You know , you know , you know ,
We say , " We say , " We 're going to go to the time .
And from the moment you 're stutually , is the spirit that you can be a bad , how can you do it ?
So you 're going to have these incredible events : following the voodoo in state of trance that touch with a rather strong demonstration demonstration , rather strong the power of mind when it 's catalyzed in a state of extreme .
And all the popular with the most extraordinary are the most extraordinary of the Nevada Santa Marta Marta , in Colombia in Colombia .
It was a sending of the macivilization that once they were living on the caraibia in the Colombia in the conquest , popular , popular , popular , popular , the popular wild playing on the plants of the plants .
In a drum continent drum continent , this popular was never conquisted by by the spagef .
But there are governmentary , but they 're going to be extraordinary .
The young people follow up to the families to three or four years , and live secregated secregate in a world made of good , and hombucks in a very good way , and they live in a long time .
Two periods of nine years old choices to provide the noine months of the agement of the mother , now are metaphor , now are metaphor , they are metaphor in the Grance .
And so , that time , they 're acculated to values of their society , values that are prey and only their prey prey , and only their price , they 're going to do the cost -- or to say the equilibriecological .
And in the term of this incredible initiation , they 're suddenly going to be able to the age of 18 years , you see a age . And in that active , and in that active , when the sun is the values of beautiful pathful , all that they 've learned in the theory . And the first thing that has learned in the theory . The splending a passionate and he says , a passionate , and he 's going to say ,
" I said , " Would you like to you .
It 's study . Now it 's study . It 's about .
They call it greators and say that we , brothers are the color , we are the cold of the world .
This level of intuition is extremely important .
When we think about Ingence and the old invote in the winds of the notion of the wild , which is a concept of wild , which is a razen concept in its simplicity in the surface of us .
The Ingenes are not feeling nis feeling nine indebolites from the nostaly .
There is no space for these things in the paluary of the Aststage of the wind , but because of the time and the time and the time and the time and the rights , they made a mystics of the Earth is not about the concept of the Earth can only be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to have to be able to be able to suruse .
What does that mean ?
And that 's going to say that a girl of the Ande that growing mountain is a spirit of Apu who will be a human being being being being being a human being being being being being being being being a different human being being being being being being being being being being a different boy of the Montana that grow in a massive girl , which was a mountain in the mountain of rock , you have a massive massive spots to be able to be a a bottom .
That 's the dimora of a spirit or a mineral was irrelevant .
What 's interesting is that is the metaphor and the natural world .
I grew up in the forests of Columbia Britritish credying that forests to be cut .
And that 's a different human being different from my friends Kwakiutl that believe that the forests are the forests of Hukukuk and the ball of the wild and the spirites that are going to live in the world , we 're going to be the north of the world , spiritish in the world , spiritual , spiriting the Hamp .
If you start looking at that these cultures can create different reality , you can start to start to understand some fewer fewer fe-sensational discovery .
I 've been taken this picture to aprile in Amazon the Western Amazon .
Mayahuash , the most powerful potent , the most powerful substance , the most powerful substance .
What makes the fascinating ayahuh is not the potential potential is not the potential potential of the substance , but its elaboration . It 's composite by two elements .
From one side , this lian launch of a series of carboline , harm and harm , slightly fallucinogene .
Take the only plants , you have a blueaster that altera little bit of the cost , but it 's measure with the fleaves of a family of caffee , and he said , Psychotridis .
This plants could be a lot of triptic , very similar to serotonine , dimethyptamine , methoxtamine , methoxtles .
If you 'll see the Yanomami , you 'll see the bird of the bird of a different species , anchchis contains in a different species , anchchis contains .
And then you get that polar on the birth is a little bit like to be sparked by a carc carry of dipink , and to land on a sea of electricity .
I was often going to be able with my professor , Richard Evan Shultes , the man who swear was psychchesh , with his discovery of the fungi of the fungi of the 200s in Mexico .
And I think of my teeth , you can 't have to class these tripptamine as because if you 're not going to tell anybody to tell anybody to be alloloved .
It 's possible to be at the time if you 're doing other substants that you have the MAO .
Now it 's the beautiful : the IIs that 's been injury in this lian injury , of MAO , the same kind of necessary to potential the sorts of the same kind of necessary to potential , like these popular species , how these popular people are in a flap , like these popular babababove .
We use the big eufe-prove and the mistaining , which can reveal infruherror .
But if you ask the Indians , and they 'll tell us " The piant . "
What does that mean ?
This tribes , the Cofan , and it has 17 variety of ayahuash , which is nahuash in the forest , and that you can get into the same species .
If you ask how to stick them as they 're going to tell us , " I thought I was thinking about plants , and I was going to tell you about the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest , you know , you know , how to stbilived them .
The solution is : you take the 17 variety in a night of the lone , and each one will have a different sitting in a tune .
And on this this is not a lot of them to be laurea lot of interesting that you count the stage .
Now , [ [ applaushes the problem is that even those of us who have to heart heart heart indeed in the spring of our real world , but somehow to reducts in the history of the respect to our real world , and pass .
In fact , the Xcentury , in 300 years , not will remembered for his guerre or innovations , but rather as the one is where we stopped and we have active or accepted , but it 's accepted or accepted , and we 're going to accepted , and we 're going to be able to change .
All the search through sears are involved in a dance for new life .
And the problem is not technology .
The Indians Sioux have no stopped when they put it out and fly as American American American American American have not stopped as as American American American American , when they put it out and calculus .
It 's not the change or technology that are threating the etnosphere . It 's the power .
The domination or flight .
And if you give a look at the world , you 'll find that these are not destinated cultures .
They 're creatures and dynamic dynamic existence from the forces of hythy identify , and they go beyond .
I know , you know , you know , you know , the paper of the Penan --
a popular notion of Sarawak , in the west est , a popular that has lived lived in the forest to a generation , and now reduced to a generation , and now reduced to the re-based , where you can see the fiume , where you can see the fifiume that looks like to take a winner of the Mar Cinese Mouth Cinese , where the nat the nat the nat the nat the nat the nat the nat the nat the street , where the nat the nat the nat the nat the nat the nat ,
You know , you know , you know , the subtle with the subtits of the forest .
Or , in the case of Yanomami , are the disease that are the first of the golden .
If we 're going to move on on the Tibet , where I 'm doing many research , you 'll see the last flight flight flight .
As you 'll know the genocide , the physical extension of a popular , but the ethnocide , but the woocide , the destruction of a popular , not only is not just a popular . But it 's not just celebrate , because it 's not not just celebrate .
And you can 't understand the Tibet of the Tibet until the beginning .
I 've been loved the 6,000 miles from Chengdu in China Western Coccial China , come to Lhasa with a young connecto , but only come to Lhasa young link , but only I got to read the statistics of the statistics of which we hear .
6,000 monuments sacres in the cheap and cenables .
1.2 million people killed by military , in the Cultural ,
The father of this guy was ascritical to the Panchen Lama .
The thing that is that it was killed to the tempts of the invasion .
I was worse with Sua Santity in Santity during the popular in Nepal .
See mother was impried and his cold was being rich .
It was brought to the age of two hidden birth of two hidden birth in his wand-up because he couldn 't have to live without him .
The sister , who did the same , which has been med in reeducational field .
A day , he was a waster calculated fashion , for this transgression , was med to work with forced to work with seven years .
The pain of Tibet can be inherred , but the spirit of the popular is tener to the present .
And finally , everything you reduces a choice .
We want to live in the world world world , pollution or we want to account the world polycle , the world polymph of diversity ?
The big anthropologa Margaret Mead , before he said that his larlarger was that , in our big paar , in our lost lost of the world , not only see the whole gamorer of human imagination , but one day we 're going to see the whole modents of thinking , but a day we 're going to be .
And it 's umillion remembering that our species is existed for 60,000 years .
The Rivolution Neolitics , who given us the agriculture , which has done us suck for the seed of seed , resting the poet-year-old , creating the poetime of the clero , and we have a lot of specialization , and we talked about 10,000 years ago .
The modern world industry has been 300 years old .
That 's not suggest to me that we have the risk that we have to risk all the challenges that we have to reach in a millennia to come .
When these miriads of cultures of the world comes to say , what humans is , respond with 10,000 voices .
And it 's in these answers that we all risk the chance of being what we are : a conscious species , which has to make all popular , and all the gives can fiorders . And there are big moments of optimism .
I 've been taken this to the North ext of Baffin , when I went to the whales with the whales of the whales , and this man , Olaya , and this man , Olaya , and he told me the wonderful story of his grandfather .
The government was not always gentle-always was gentile with the popular Inuit , and in the ' 50s to stbiliar our sumatives , we have required them in colonies .
The grandfather of this man refall .
The family , I 'm going to take all the time , and all his attle , and all his attle .
You have to know that Inuit doesn 't have a freedom , you know , you know ,
The pattins of slegs in origin was made of fish flight in the skin .
The grandfather of this man did not paid out of the night or the library , or from the library , which was being being being .
It 's sgattle , you 've got the pantalones in the skin in skin and defocused in your hand . When I did you do it , you have to do it , the work , you 've worked a lamage .
He spring on the points of this colphone coltelem and when I became solid , and when I became solid , he killed a dog .
He took a brief , and created a briler , with the cases made a sled , he made a sleta , and it 's gone on on the bunch , collective , collection of the bulk , and he 's got a glasher .
We want to talk about caving caving with nothing ?
In the total april 1999 , the downnal government has redied to the total control of a larger territory of a larger territory of the larger California and Texas mb California and Texas mmed .
It 's their new patria . It 's called Nunavut .
It 's a independent territory . Contrologies all the resources .
One of the splendido as a national national state can recognize with his popular .
And , finish , I think it 's pretty obvious at least at least at those remote remote song of the planet , and make it doesn 't really have to remote remote .
For someone 's home .
They 're going to be a several of human imagination that are rising to the background . And for all of these children , like the dreams of these children , become part of the swide of the hope hope .
And finish , we have to National Geographic are convints that politicians will never be .
We think the polemies --
[ [ Applausi ] are not persuasive , but we believe that stories can change the world , and maybe we are the best institution to tell stories of the world . Each month our own own 35 million visits own own own 35 million visits lived .
156 countries have transforming our television television .
Our revists are lette by millions of people .
Our work is to travel in the etnosphere to bring our audience in places of wonderful cultural places that will go out to how they have seen and cultural reveal , and they 'll give you , you 'll be able to come up with the central world , and we have to find a life in the world , and we have to find a plurch of life in a pluraly-like world and cultural world 's life in a main the world , and we have to find a life in a main in the world , and we 're going to have been a major ,
which is the saggeity of all popular can contribute to our benbe like to be collective .
Thank you .
I 'm going to talk about some things that I wrote in this book that I hope you 've heard and provered to proverse some connections , in case you don 't notice .
I 'd like to start with what I call " " " " " " " " "
The dogma official dogma ?
The dogma is the official of all the Western industry , the official official society , " If we want to massimilar to our citizens , " The way to do that is massive to do that is massive to do that is massive to do that . " If you want to massive freedom . "
The reason is , from a side , in fact that freedom is in the fact that freedom is , useful , it 's essential for humans .
And at the other is that if we 're libers , each of us can do it for all that massive , you know , what we have like our benbe , without any that you decided to do that .
The way to massive freedom is massive to massive choice .
More choices people have , more libs are , and the major is their benbe .
This , I think , is so , it 's so double in society that nobody would have to get it in the wild .
And it 's also deeply royed in our lives .
I 'm going to show you some examples of what progress has made possible .
This is my supermarket . It 's not particularly big .
I loved a simple note on the condition of inherself .
In my supermarket are 175 conditional conditional -- without contact 10 variety of the extruth , and 12 aceters that you can understand the same as a lot of conditional condition of the stanks that you can understand a huge conditional conditional than one of the 175 proning , you can understand the same same same same way .
That 's the supermarket .
Then you go to the wooog of electronic electronic , you know , the CD , radio , radio , piac , the lefer .
And in this single nego-like , the electronic negod of the audio number of audio .
We can do six million different combinations using components , using components that there are in a negod .
You have to admit that there is a lot of choice .
Of course , the world of communications .
And once , when I was a child , you could get all the telephone services , pat the wish , that they were forborn by the mom Bell .
It was given the phone , you didn 't understand it .
One of that , the phone was that , between another one , was that the phone don 't break .
These days are going to go .
Now we have a neighborhood of telephones , specially between cell phones .
Here 's the cell phones .
My favorite is in the middle , MP3 , tapeless , and forward the baby , and forward for the brand and the baby for the brand .
If you don 't have seen in the negother under home , you 're going to be able to be .
And what happens is that happens is that people go into the negots and does this question . And you know , what is the answer is " No .
It 's not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn 't do that .
So , in other things that are much more important than the buy of the budden , you know , the same expensive choices .
Axxxustage : not happens in the United States that you go from the doctor and the doctor you have to do .
Instead , you go to the doctor , and the doctor says , " Okay , we could do . "
You know , " Dootore , what should I do ? "
And the doctor says , " A has these benefits and these risks , and B has these benefits and these risks . "
" What you want to do ? "
And you rebits : " Dootor if she was , what would do ? "
And the doctor : " But I 'm not . "
The result we call it " autonomy maled , expression that makes it look like a beautiful thing .
But actually it 's not that one to move the fish and responsibility to make someone who knows something , is , you know , okay , you know , you know , you know , and it 's not a lot of maled -- and so not in the right condition to make patient decisions .
There 's a huge marketing of products , you know , you know , people like me and you , who think you think you can 't understand it .
But if we can 't buy them , why do you have public ?
The answer is that they want to be at the doctor to ask us to change it .
And so , as the fundamental as our identity is a question of choice , as you see in this vignel , " We don 't want to to give children . Sceet the time , " We don 't want to get a bit more identity : we have to inventing .
And we can reinventing how many times us do .
The one is that means that every morning , you have to decide that kind of person you want to be .
I was a family and the major time , a time , a time , at the time , it was that there was a lot of time , it was that there was a higher possible , and he was that you could be on the most price .
The only verage was a lot of who , not when , and even even what do after .
And it 's really done , all is really playing .
I mean , I 'm going to have a lot of work than a time .
And it 's not because they 're not just brilliant , not because they are dealing .
but why are I impensive , I mean , I would say , " Doshould you get to do it ? " I should do that ? "
" Do I should you get to think before I have to think before the children or career ? "
They are interrotatives logorants .
And they try to answer these questions , even though this implation not to do the companies that assum and not get a beautiful vote to my exame .
And they have to do that . They are important .
Now , the work : we are lucky , as Carl socking , because technology allows us to work every day , every day , from every day , from every day , and then the dangle of the planet , transportation .
And I 'm talking about , there 's a angoline , and I didn 't tell anywhere where , WiFi works .
I don 't say , because I want to use .
What does that mean , this incredible freedom of choice that we have to continue , continually , if we have to work or not .
We can go to see our son playing with the cell phone , with the mobile phone , the Blackberry in the other , and the tebook , and notebook , and notebook , and the ginock .
And even though I have all spent , every minute that we see our son , we 're also asking , and we 're also asking , " I have to answer this call ? "
" I have to answer this email ? I have to get this letter ? "
And even when the answer is " no , all this makes the experience of your own son , very fun from what it would be in other conditions .
So , as you look at all , small things and big , objects , things and big materials and life , life is a question of choices .
Once the world was this : Of , there were some possibilities , but not all was a question of choice .
The world of today is , the world 's dealing with this : " It 's a positive thing , or negative ? "
The answer is Seeef .
So , the slightly we know , so I 'm going to talk about the negative ones .
All this choice compories two negative effects of people .
The first , paradoxally , is that produced ed , it 's that makes a freedom .
With many options between the ones that are going to get to be very hard to do it .
I 'm going to give you an example : a study conduct on the plants of flight .
A connected my connects to the data of Vanule , the gantesh society of a lot of a million clients of a clients of clients .
What she discovered is that for every 10 solutions that are offer , the percentual , the percentual , the lower lower , two percent .
With 50 source , there is 10 percent in less adesions than adesions . Why ?
Because with 50 source , which is maleded to decide , is maledly hard to decide , and the choice is remaining .
And to ask , and again , I asked the tomorrow , I asked asked the tomorrow , and of course , we 're never going to .
You know , not only means that these work from old old old , because they don 't have enough money , because you don 't have enough money , wants to say that the decision is so ostics that allows also lose the datatest of work .
I don 't talk about , they 're losing until five dollars a year , for a year , which is going to be blind .
So the paralis is a consequence of having trouble to have trouble .
And I think that makes the world so much .
" And to finish , " And to finish , keternity : Do send ? "
You 're going to take the right decision , if it 's for the eternity , right ?
You don 't want to choose the wrong condition , and you know the wrong condition .
So this is the first effect . The second is that we can also have to avookay and do a choice , we are less substered by the result of how we were being being being being in with less options .
And this for different reasons .
One of these is that with many conditions that you 're going to be able to imagine that , if you can 't do a different , is to imagine that you could have a different different choice that would be better . And that 's going on to be better . And that 's going on to be better . And that 's going on to be better . And that 's going on to be better . And the restage of the substantly re-deep ,
even when it was a great decision .
More choices are , more easy is to disliliked any detail that 's insophister than the option of the option of the option .
And also , there is what economists call .
Dan Gilbert has close very well as the value that we have to value things that we 're going to depend to what we 're doing .
And then , when there are many options , you know , it 's easy to represent the characteristics of the alternative alternative artch and be less subdatives .
So , I know , I 've got to all those who are New York .
But that 's what you probably think you probably think .
There 's this couple of Hamptons .
A place of the lushed .
Spiach . Ottan . Ottma day . It 's all for them .
Not all it . But what he thinks is , " Well , maltion , maltion , is Agoam . "
" All my neighborhood , my neighborhood is . "
" I could talk about it in front of the house . "
And I think two weeks assillate from the idea that 's losing -- every day -- the chance of parking where you want .
The expensive opportunity to be the subddisfation for what we have , but when you have , you know , when you have been doing it .
And the most of the options that we have to consider , the most characteristics will be reeating with how expensive opportunity .
Here 's another example .
This is a vision of us .
It 's about the time , and maybe to live lenty .
But the most important point is that you choice , you go to do not do other .
The things that we don 't have a lot of attractive attractive , that can make less attractive what we do .
Third point : The spiral grow .
I tried to my skin bought a new jeans .
I 'm almost always jeans .
And once the jeans were just a kind of , buy and vestius , they were discovered , only after I had been discovered , after I had a life and work a lot of times , they began to go well .
So , I went to buy a couple of a couple of time when the old old old old old , and I said , " I need a couple of jeans , this is my cut . "
The commit to me , " Look , what 's going to do ?
And you want to do it for the circump ? " Stonebottles or " " Hehub and " acidan acider " ? "
" Look wants to be strated ? "
" Sotto eight them ? Bla bi -- " Continule -- " Continule was going to get .
I was sleep , and after a little bit of a little bit , and I want to say , " I want to know what -- was the only kind of like , " I want to have a hour , and then I tried to all the way to be able to say , " I want to be a few miles of the best jeans that I had ever .
It was the massive . Con all that I had to get the best .
But I feel worse .
Why ? I wrote a whole book for understood .
The reason I was worse is that with all the choice of my expectations were altime , jeans had to be perfect .
I was expected to be expected . I didn 't expect any exceptional , when I was going to live in a kind of , but when I was viding 100 different , accidents , at least a kind of had to be perfect .
What I had to buy was good , but not perfect .
After I had paragoned what I was trying to do , I was sitting in confronted .
The add of options in life doesn 't do to get expectations that these have respect to the expectations of the options .
And this will proud less subddisfation , even when the result of the result of them .
Nobody in marketing , if you realize .
Because if they knew , you don 't know what I 'm talking about .
The truth is the most of this .
" You know , he was better when he was worse , " The reason that was better when he was worse when he was worse was going to meet of surprised .
Ost , in the world that we live -- opulents , industry , industry , industry , with the expection -- the massive massive , that we can hope is that things are in the expectation .
You don 't have surprised as your expectations , because your expectations , I have been inganttic .
The secret of happiness -- that you 're here -- is , " Bought waiting . "
I mean -- a little automoke -- that 's really sposed and my wife is really study .
I couldn 't do do better , I didn 't have any content .
But it 's not always a good thing .
Finally , a consequence of jeans discoveries when there 's only that kind of jeans is that when you 're not suddenly , and you know , " Why ? "
" Who is responsible ? " , the answer is close .
The world is the responsible . What can you do ?
When you 're hundreds of types of jeans , and you understand a insoddisfactor , and you ask who is responsible , is the responsible , is alyes you 're going to .
You could do better .
With hundreds of variety of variety have no long-cut .
So when people take them , even though the result is , even though the result is wild , they feel like they 're going to be able to hold them .
In the last years , the depression is explose in the world .
I think a factor -- not the only one , but important -- of this hond is , but important -- of this depression is that people have experiences because they 're too allowed .
And when they have to explain this situation that the cold is .
So the final result is that in general , we 're going to hear it .
Let me remember .
This is the official dogma , what we all take for good and it 's completely fast . It 's not true .
There 's no double than a little bit of choice is better than to have to do it , but by this not going to be able to be a little bit better than a little bit .
There 's a critical value , magic . I don 't know what it 's .
But I 'm pretty sure we have been to super-scale , where you have to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able enough .
Now , from the political perspective -- I 've been -- from the political view , the noction is the following .
What you allow this to be the seal of industry is the rchemistry .
There are many places in the world , and you know , you know , where the problem is not that have been very much choice .
The problem is that they have too long .
So , the factory that I 'm talking is a maling males of modern , rich society is a malal , rich society .
And what it does to have to depress and arrative is this : Steve Levitt you talked about how those expensive and discoveries of how those expensive and discovered . It 's a sprite of money .
I mean that these choices , complicated and available , it 's not that are just inuseful .
I 'm addict .
They 're worse .
If a little bit of what in our society is reversated in our society , and people have too much to be able to be able to be able to be able to improve but our life .
This is what economists call a paretary improvement .
A redistribution redistribution , all of the time -- not only to poor poor , because of this choice in excited .
And finding , " You can get everything you want to become everything you want to .
You know , people of culture , you think , " But what does that fish ?
" It 's obvious you can 't get to get a glass of glass . "
" An imagine castrated , a vision of the world --
and I 've got the interpret so , at the beginning .
But then , I think , instead , instead , I realized that fish knows the long knows .
Because the reality of fact , it 's what if you 're sitting in frantums , so that you can 't get freedom . You get the parality . You get the parald .
If you get the bock in a way that everything diminute possible deminate ,
You 're going to get the paralage , and you 'll get the benbe .
Everybody need a sphere .
This is almost certainly too quickly , maybe even even for us .
But the above without some symbolic symolic sphere is a rich for infelity and theme , for the druin .
Thank you very much .
