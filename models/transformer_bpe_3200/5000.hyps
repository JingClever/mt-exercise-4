The year I showed this diamamp to show that the cuth of the glacial meant , which for almost three million years has had the size of the 48 of the United States , is restreet of the United States , is restreet of the 40 percent .
And so I was going to be a gravity of the problem because it doesn 't have the spending of the ice .
The glacial glacial artics is , in a sense , the heart of the most of the climate system .
You have to be invers and you 're sitizen .
The next next diastic next died to be a fast-year-old old old old old .
The ice ice acts are saved in the crossing .
As you see , you see it to the blue .
That 's the ice in the evers , which is the walk of the estate .
You can see that the cosidgn , of five years or five years or more , it 's as the blood , which is how the blood of the body .
In 25 years , it 's past that , so .
This is a problem because the recently recently , the same same same time around the ocean , where there are enormous amount of carbon , where there are enormous , they have translated in the middle of the microbes .
It 's the totality of the totalks of the same way to the global warming , that amount of the global amount of of that , in the deping , superriting .
In some lagey profound in Alaska metan in Alaska in the water .
The professorse Katey Walter of Alaska is recently , with a team of a fly team of a fly stage .
Video : Wow ! I 'm going to be good .
A reason is that this remarker is that this maining Groenland from the Nortorth .
This is a regime to the glacial regime .
The landed had never reach them to be a six-sixx-sixxial .
This is the Kangerlussus , in the supped of the Groenland .
If you want to know how to the sea level of the sea paces of the ice , it 's where you reach the sea .
These are degreen in the damamage .
The other part of the planet : Antares , the most big block of ice ice ice ice .
The month month , the scientists have dichieved that the walk in the negative is in negative , and that the Antargual west , which is starts on some sununlight , is starting to the walk .
It 's a lot of the level of the ack-level of the top .
Suli Himalaya , the third biggest stick , you see new lagey , you see new lagey , who were ice .
The 40 percent of the population of the water water .
Sulle Ande : this ice is the source of the water .
The landed is aumented .
But when it didies , the same same time to the same time .
In California the neve of the Siar Nevada is dioooxial .
The wils are in crisis .
The predictions , like you know , they 're good .
The growth sent in the world world world in a remarkets of the inenthy .
The disaster are aumental aumental , and without predict out of the normal and without predicted .
Four times more numheroes in the last 30 years .
This is a well-argue .
If you look at the context , if you can see the consequences .
In the last five years we have add 70 million of CO2 every 24 hours -- 25 million -- 25 million -- 25 million of the ocean every day .
Look at the area of the area of the Pacific area , from the west , and on the west , and on the west of the subject , where there 's a roomer than the ocean .
The most most results of the global warming , and the deforestation , which is the 20 percent , is the use of the cool of the existed .
The oil is a problem , and the carbon is even even worst .
The United States are one of the United States are a lot of the same time , in the Cina .
And it was propond of a lot of the most central cold .
But we 're going to have a changing direction .
These are the projects in the last few years and some of the most of the last few people of the veral .
And so , there 's a political way in our Paese .
The carbon of the carbon and the oil have 250 million dollars in the last year to move the coal of the carbon , which is a oxy-to-to---------------------------to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to----
That 's the image I remember something --
I know Natal Natal , in Tennesesp , where I was a lost of 3.8 billion powers of the last miles .
Maybe you 've seen on the notively .
This is the biggest second big fluslied in America .
It 's happened around Natal .
The midrug was this .
Video : I 'm going to be a kind of the carbon is a kind of a bunch and happy .
It 's a saving here in America , and it 's grow our economy .
It 's more than the carbon is always the most miggen .
It 's a good piece , adorable and the work and the mainly stage .
Gore : So , it 's part of the carbon of the West Virginia .
The most big society society is the mountain the mountain . This is his frightly .
Video : Don : Don Blankenship : Sararm , Nancy Pelery , Harry Don , Harry Don 't have no .
Gore : So , the Gore , Aleance for the Clima has two camppaid .
This is a part of it , one part .
Video : AOALergy we see the climate change change as a sery seria as a sery sery meaning in our business .
So , in this first ority is investment to be able to be a lot of money in a source to make a lot of money to make the verity on the carbon .
It actually , the carbon is not sporite .
We think it 's a good -- it 's also a good good good .
So , not prepackake the climate change .
And let me do it .
Video : Acore : Carbone -- you 've heard a lot of it .
So , we put a lot of the sorts of the town in a bottom of the carbon .
Straordinary ! The machines are a little bit of the cool , but this is the supped of the carbon .
The consumers of carbon is between the main the main of the global warming , but the night night that you see all all .
You have a homan : this is the odiern technology of the carbon .
At the same time : Indian , the alternative , the alternational security and the security of the security .
Video : The glacier : The economy , the economy my my own own own own own , the crisis .
The hold that the walk : our dependence of the cobuts , as the carbon , as the carbon , as the oil .
Now , I 'm going to be a new , audace for use .
Again : 100 percent of energy energy energy , in the 10 years .
A plan to reput America to work , make us more sure , and help us to stop the reference the global warming .
So , a solution that we have to solution to solve our problems .
And they 're going to America .
Gore : This is the last .
Video : I 'm going to reach the energy to America .
One of the most ways of the most ways of the dependence of the dependence of the time .
So , the future is here . The future is here .
Exarts : Nooowils for places of work work .
Exxxy-time time . It 's time to be realists .
At Gore : A old , a little bit of the time , you want to go to the walk from , you go from the solar .
If you want to go back to the way , you go together . "
We have to go from , it 's very quickly .
Thank you very much .
The year year year at TED , I was a introduction on the LHC .
And I promise to get to get to get to the machine .
So , I was the time . And for the time , there were no , the LHC is the most experiment , the most experiment , 27 kilometers of the major , 27 kilometers of the conference .
Her is reach the conditions that were present less than a million than a second from the beginning of the universe -- until 600 million times in the universe -- until 600 million times in the second .
So , this is just ununfortunous .
This is the same machine Ginevra .
We have a hour our plan an .
This is what I work . It 's called ATLATLATLATLATLAS --
This is a picture of ATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLAS in building .
The 10 settember of the last year we have acceso the car for the first time .
And this picture was scaped by ATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLAS .
And it was because of the immense of control .
It 's a picture of the first walk around the LHC , and they were all the time of the HC , and in collision , with a part of the HC , and the spent of the HC , and in the role in the reach .
In other words , when we see that image 10 settember , we realize that the machines was a big vitten .
I didn 't know if it was to make us to do that , when somebody went on Google , when somebody went on Google and vide that the page was this .
That means we had a cultural cultural cultural .
And I was a week later , there was a problem with the machines , I had to have this pay here -- these shaped .
These are the same jourourself when the machines works at the massive of the potencency .
Now , the technical nical nets of you look at the time , " It 's not true .
And they can do it because when they 're very cosiddle the cosiddle .
So , at least 271 degrees , to the time , at least 271 dead , these packers , these packers , these share the time .
In the most of the gift of the most nose of the HC , there was a difeter of the most of the babication .
So the fix of the pushed , and the 13,000 practttremended a resistence .
This was the result .
Now , this is still more than 20 ton--year--to-to---to--to----------------------------------------year-year-to-to---year-old , and that 's more more than 20 cently about 30 cently 30 cently , and that these magnetnetworks .
They 're damed about 50 magnetworks .
We had to have to take them , what we did .
We have pristined and enjoined them .
They 're all to the time to their place .
I 'm going to the end of the third LHC is going to be new integror .
We 're going to be able , and we 're going to get the right data , and we 're going to get the right of the right , and we 're morning the universe .
Now , of course , in a way , these expensive expensive way , these expensive , the debed in the value of science and engineering .
I think the fact that 's so hard , the fact , the fact , I think that 's the value of things like the LHC .
I want to be going to end with the words of a scientists , Humphrey , which , the way , the walk , which , the way of the sunds of his own own own own own own own own , his pupile , his byond Michael Fararel Fareas for the human human human human human human human human human human human human human human human human human human human sciouses , which is , which is , and the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the human human human human human human human human human human human human human human human human human human human human human human human human human human human human human human human human human human human human human human human human human human human human human human human human human human human beararararararararararards ,
Thank you .
I want to start to ask you to rethink when , children , the town wers .
And as you get them as reach them and reach them , you take them them and move them , learn , and learn to think and solve the problems and solve problems .
The reasoning is profly connected to the way we understand that we understand the world around us .
So , from the information of our interaction with the objects , and my own interaction with objects , and my conflict of the Jeevan Kalalalize , I started to ask me , and when we 're a computer , and when we 're a computer , when we 're a computer , in the digm of the willland-wiling , as we 're going to be a little bit of a wall-well-walk with a , and I can be a little bit a little bit ,
and sistn it it to our rescuse ?
The question was so interesting to exploring the answer is that we decided to exploring the Siftable .
In a few words , a Siftable computers .
In a few words , a Siftable computers .
And then you can move with the hand , they can see the way to the movement and a screen and a screen and a radio .
But sound , they 're objects , they can move the major , you can move the way .
The Siftable is the example of a new ecool system to the digital information .
And then the most physics , consciousness , and the most movement , and and the most physics , and the most physics , and we know the other than , we can exploring , we can exploring new and the funny of interaction .
I 'm going to start with some example .
This Siftable is configured to show the video : if you pay the video , the video , the video video , the video of the other side of the hand-time time time .
These are interactive active active , I think about the other .
If you 're interested in , they 're interested in what 's going to be in .
If they 're constantly constantly , they can be a little bit .
If they 're constantly constantly , they can be a little bit .
They also have the movement and inination .
We realized that one of the interested in the interaction of the interaction of the interaction was the common on the data , to the most of the data , to the same same time .
In this case , we have three Siftable as a nice of the vernice and I can use them to the color in what the central of the central , where you 're missing .
and I can use them to the color in the central , where you 're missing .
If we 're too too , we can get a little bit about it .
And I 'm also good for appreneurs , like the mathematics and games , and the math of the logics and see the people can be able to be able to see the results of the time .
I 'm going to --
This is a sequence of Fibonacks I do with a program of equations .
And we have a game of words that 's a half of Scareer and Bobobject .
Pratically , at every turn-case , in the case of every Siftable , Pratically , to every turnn-case , and as you see a literally , and as you see a literally , and as you see the horororse of the wilddary .
And then , after about 30 seconds , and you have a new bunch of the targuing and new chance to try .
Thank you .
That 's how we went to the Media Lab , I did it in the way I tried to be able to the video .
They have to be very much .
And one of the interesting things about this , that is that we have not to have to tell you a lot of the instructions .
You just just say , " Compics of the words , and they 're exactly what do .
That 's how they try it .
This is our own walk on the most young , there is the right .
It actually wanted to just take it .
They 're just just morning , for him .
Now , this is a application of a whole interactive interactive .
We had to build a tool for the instrument for the language of language and said ,
It can be able to be a new character in the Siftable .
It can be able to be a new character in the Siftable .
That 's , it 's going to use the sununch .
Video : The ssundy-sunged .
David Merrill : Now , he took a treat .
Video : The treators .
Bel work !
So , we 're going to be able to the Siftable and they can interact the character --
Video : Bau !
And I invented the story .
Video : Hey : Hao !
DM : It 's a story with the final story with it , and you can decide it .
DM : It 's a story with the final story with it , and you can decide it .
Video : Vola .
DM : The last example I 've got a tools , I 've got a tools , to be a recent , to be a recent , and exef music .
It 's a cstrument , we made of a fast , to the way to the music .
The Siftable here are aged from the bottom , the bacteria .
Each one of these have four different variations , and you can get what you use .
You can also have to be able to the same same .
And modifiction it just just to do a " supply , " and a sequence . "
These are actually actually , you can control from the vious , like the revers and the films .
They have a particular supped , and then they inlamp to come out .
And then there are the general , as a general time and wanted to the intersequence .
We 're going to be able .
Video : We 're going to be a bottom in two Sifly Sifly , we 're going to be a whole series , the babs , we add the other bottom , we adadd the bottom .
Now , I 'm going to be a bottom .
Video : I 've add percent of the percent of the percent of the way --
Video : I 'm going to put the bacteria , so I can control the effect from the time .
Video : DM : I can see the intersequence , the interest to the whole sequence , from a other side or the other side or .
Video : I 'm going to be a filter , I 'm going to be the map to give more expression .
Video : I can recombinating the sequence of the sequence of the sequence .
So I don 't have to planning it before , but I can 't improve , reprenef .
And now , I can go to the whole sequence , I can the intersequence , the same time , I can be the same . "
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is build new interest , and the most subst-machines like work , and the way to the most most subject .
And I had time to show you one of the result of this lowing , and also some chance that we 're going to take out of the lab .
The concept I want to put you is that 's that 's going to put this new generation of objects for interact with the media media , which we want to have this new way that we want .
Thank you very much .
I don 't see the time to talk about you .
I 'm a truly wrote .
It 's a bookkground is my profession but it 's more than this , obviously .
It 's also love love and the hored of my life .
And I don 't expect that can change .
But , he said this , something particular is succeful in my life and in my career , which was to recently , which has been trying to recently .
The particular thing is I 've been written this book , this particular book , this biography called " Many , Pran , and the " which , diversely was the workbooks , for some reason I was going to get a big , and it 's going to be a great great feeling , and it 's going to be a great great great international .
And the result is that anywhere where they 're going to be able to me as if I was all the time .
It 's true -- I 've been cut .
They have a lot of the time I 'm going to have to be able to do you more to do you better than I do better ?
You have no longer to writer to write the life without that we can be able to create a book that can be able to someone ? "
which can we important to someone ? "
It 's rassupply , you know .
But it could go worst , I think about the time , I remember the time , when I started to say , to say , to say , I was a wrote .
I was in the same reaction to the same reaction .
And people said , " I didn 't have successed to have successed ?
You have no landscape that the refied of the rified of the rified ?
You have no land-to-to-to-to-wwouldn 't come out of the sorts of a sundamamamong with the board of the board , with the boouth , you know , you have no hold ? "
And so , you know .
The answer -- the good answer to all these questions is , " You . "
I have a lot of all of the things .
I 've got a painting .
And I also have a lot of other things that people can 't have to be inating .
As the alth and other things spent .
But , as I was about the writing what I was thinking about the last monmonstrstrly , is why ?
That 's rational ?
It 's logical that anybody to be spent to be spent to be spent to be a job that you have to do .
But what 's so particular in the same time in the resolologists to make it the saves in a way that other people are not doing ?
How my father , for example , he was a engineering engineering and not remember a time in his 40 years of the early , in his 40 years of the early , what was asked if they were paper ?
There was never -- that was -- that stone of the engineering John , how ?
It didn 't work so , it was that ?
Onestly , engineers like a group of seargument , in the seargued , in the seargued , the reputation of the reputation of the reputation of the depressive .
We have enough to have enough to have this reputation , and not only that that we have this reputation of any , we have this reputation of a huge instable ininstable .
And it 's not not the other that look at the trip of the magnifes of the magnifments that , only in the only one century , dead , dead , they 're dead .
And also the ones that they 're not suicians are recially disappeared by their dones .
North Mailer , before , at the last interview said , " Overy my book , " Overy my book , " Overy my book , " One is about the extraordinary life of their life .
But we don 't have the hold , when we heard these things , because we 've heard these things in some way we have interiorized and acception the notion that is the notion that is in some way , the end , the end , the end , the end , the end , the end , the end of the end , the end , we 're going to be able to the time .
And the question I want to take all of the way to all of the time , is , you know , what do with this idea ?
And it 's good , because I also went to the centimage of a distance of the distance , I don 't know for anything to be the exposition .
I think it 's odious .
And I think it 's also dangerous , I don 't see the perspective in the next century .
I think it 's better indealing our big creative creative creative lives .
And I think I 'm sure I was in my case -- in my case , it would be very dangerous to be able to the way to the same same same , in my own own career .
Ovice -- indeed , I 'm pretty young , I 've been about 40 years .
I 've got about four decacades of work in me .
And it 's very likely that any thing I 'm going to be right now now , then it 's going to be the job of my last book .
I 'm going to go back , because we 're all more or less friends here -- it 's the most successful in my big successful .
Oh , Gesber , who thought !
You know this is the kind of thought that door person to start to brought in the nove of the morning and I don 't want to do it .
I would continue to do this work that work that we 're going to do this work .
So , the question is that ?
And so I think it seems to be , after a lot of work to go back to writing is what to create a comic comic stage , right ?
I wanted to find a distance way to find a distance of course , I 'm write , and my natural ange , and my natural natural , and I 'm going to get a pock-time time time time , I was trying to find out to see the time , to find out of the time , to find out of the best ideas and the best ideas and make the best ideas and more and more than the best ideas of the best ideas and more things to see if you could have the best ideas and more more than the best ideas and make the best ideas of the best things to see if you to
And on how to help people believe that people creative to be motivent to the people of the creativity .
And that research was a Great and the Great and the Great and the Rome .
Seguiteef , because I 'm given up .
Neleless Great and the Great and Rome -- people didn 't believe that creativity was creating that creativity , OK ?
And they thought that is the creativity was this spiried , and that came to the people from a few surprise , for the reasons and unknown , for the reasons and known , for the reasons and knowledge .
The same same same divins were called these divins the same divine of creativity .
You look , wonderful , wonderful , created , creates to have a demon , which is saging with the walk from the street .
The Roands were the same idea , but they call that the kind of the same thing .
The great thing , because the Rohands , because the Rohands was a genime was somebody in the smark .
They think they were a genime was this kind of a devine that was literally in the murs of a artist , a little bit like the elf of a artist , a little bit like the elf of the ards of the ards of the ards and the bottom of the ards of the argue and the time .
It 's the same time -- this is the distance of which is the distance of which is the psychologigical protecttons of your work .
And all they knew that was so that was that work , right ?
So , the artists were protect from cerned things , how to the way , like a lot of the wisdom , no ?
If your work was excited to the same time , you could not take the same time , you know , you know that the wouldn 't take it .
If your job , you didn 't have the bunch your mind , right ?
Everybody knew that the genime to be a inhored .
And so people han , that people have been indemic .
And then the Rinascivement , and it 's the same idea ; we have the human being in the center of the center of the universe , and the most leaves and without more to the creatures that they walk into the creatures that they walk from the divinity .
This was the maining of humanesimum and people started to think that creativity came to think that creativity came from the iilikely .
And for the first time in the story , you 're going to referating this or that artist , as a genime , as a very genime .
And I have to tell you , I think was a big hororse .
I think it 's just a simple person to be like a recipient as a recipient as a fource , the source of all the misters , and creativins , unknown , and inknowledge a responsibility of the human responsibility .
It 's like to ask someone to be sun .
It 's a completely ego and creating all these ingestious strong to all these ingestious existed .
And I think it was this pression to have been destructed to the artists in the spent of the artists in the spent of the artists in the spent of the artists in the spent of the artists in the spent of the artists .
And , if this is that , and I think that 's the question is , and now ?
We can do it very much ?
Maybe back to a companies of human relationship between humans and mistery creative .
Or maybe no .
Maybe we can 't have a 500 years of thinking about 18 minutes .
And there 's probably people in the audience that solar would be a scientific scientific , the notion of the notion , and the pectiny , and the same way to the same same way to their projects .
I 'm going to be able to be able to be able about this what .
But the question I 'd like to take it is , why no ?
Why don 't I think about this way ?
Because it 's more more than any other thing that has ever heard to explain the experant imprevehicity .
One process that , as anybody who ever ever ever , I 've ever been tented to do something -- so , all here -- you know , you 're not understanding .
And , in fact , it can 't be a completely paranororous .
I 've done this ink in the extraordinary , which was 90s , which was 90s , but it was 90s , and she was a poored for all the life and said that was a few of the hororal in the rural camps , and he was a little bit of the horches , when I was a little bit of the hesiiium .
And he was like a fragorous fragorous .
And they came back to her from the paesp .
It was going to be , because it was going to be able to be the land in the land in the ground .
He knew that point to have a one thing to do to that point and was , " " " wouldn 't have a matters . "
And so it 's going to go to the house and she was infollowed by this poesia , and it didn 't have another piece of card and a cheap enough enough enough enough enough to the page .
Sometimes I could not be enough enough enough to be enough enough , so it was to get and correct , and he could come to the house and she was in home and she would come through the horrotoled and she would be able to the paesp , as she said , " another poet . "
And then there were the time -- this piece of the time , I 'm going to never -- there were the moments in which was almost lost , OK ?
So , it was going to go back and was trying to the walk through , and he was going through the herererated a stick in the time , and then he said , and then he was like , and then he was like , and then he was like the horored .
And I was hererself from the coda coda , and the remajor was going to the page .
And in these cases , the poesia is going to be a perfect page , but the last word .
So when I thought I 'm not walk about -- it 's exactly the same same same .
I don 't have all the process -- I 'm not a cutting way .
I 'm a mud , and my way to work is ; I see it 's ; I see it 's going to go to the same orary time and work .
But even I was , in my my walk , I was a little bit of the thing , I was on the time .
And I think I think I think that a lot of you have a lot of the time .
You know , even if the work and the ideas , you can come from a source , you can 't be honestly ,
And what 's this thing ?
And how can we put it in the way to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to get the head ?
So , as I was about , the best example , the best example I have the musicist Tom Wail , which I interviewed , which I interviewed in a day .
We were talking about this , and you know , Tom , for the most of life was the incareer of the artist , and we were the temporary of the temporary , to control , domining these species of impulults , domining these species of impululous ints .
But then I 'm going to be cut , and a day while was widing on a Los Angeles , changed all for him .
It was going to go to the walk in this little frame , and it was , and it 's going to the walk in his head as the head as the ispiration , and you know , it 's wonderful , and you know , it 's wonderful , and the desidth , you know , it 's wonderful , but it 's the dest .
It doesn 't have a piece of card , it doesn 't have a registrator .
So I started to feel this species of old old old , and I 'm going to be grow in him , and I 'm going to lose , and I 'm going to be a sessionated .
I didn 't have enough enough , I can 't do it . "
And in the panic , you 're going to stop .
I 'm going to be the interest or process and did something completely new .
I 'm just just going to the top and said , " Scell you 're not going to be guing ? "
" Ti seems to write a song time ?
If I really want to be a lot of the time , if I can take a little bit about you .
Agen , you 're going to be able to be able to be able today .
I 'm going to disturban Leonard . "
And his process changed it .
It didn 't work , the job was still still all like .
But the process , and the fish was reduce that was redued when I was releave when I was reduce to the genime , the genime that was going to be a little bit of the time , and it was going to be a whole thing that was , what was going to be a whole thing .
but I wooooxuliar , wonderful bizarra was a collaboration between Tom and this thing that was not Tom and this strange .
So how I was going to be a little bit about the way I was working on the way I was working , and I was going to save me .
This idea , I was going to save , I was going to writing " Many , and I was , and I , and I was going to be a horse that we all all all when we 're working on on something and we 're working on something that 's going to think that a disaster , which is the worth book .
It doesn 't just just , the worst thing , right the workket .
And I started thinking about a gacket this project .
But then I remember to Tom that I 'm going to tell you .
So I went to my face in the walk from the sitting and died my own face , and I was the vacackle of the room .
And I said to go , " Sararts , what we 're going to be a little bit about that if this book is not interest , no interest , no interest , no interest , no interest , no , no whole ?
Because as I see it , I 'm going to see all that I , I don 't have more about this .
So if you want to have a better , you have to tell you , and do you get your part .
OK . But if you don 't do it , I don 't do it .
I 'm going to write the same time , because it 's my job .
And I 'd like to say , I 'd like to have to be a part of my " Because , I was so , right , OK -- and it was so , OK -- and they were damong the people were roundances of the people who were rounk for the hores and the hand-music , and the hores of the hores .
And they were always magnifly , because the ballerins were great .
But every way , so , something was , something happened , and one of these artists was actually actually transended .
And I know what you know , because I know , I know , I know , at a point , a performance so .
It was like if the time you stand , and the ballerwalk through a kind of the ticken , and was not doing anything different from the soldidied , and all it was all the time , but it was all all .
And at the improve of course , as a human human .
But it 's accept from the dies in the fuel of the divinity .
And when this was the next time , I had the time , the people who were , they were going to be with her name .
They were gave the hands and they were to dog , " Allah , Allah , Allaoh , Allaoh , "
That 's God , you know .
Curious remarkable -- when the Mororororous Mers of Spaign , I was this abundine to their and the pronunch of the " Allaoh , Allaoh , Allaoh , Allaoh , Allaoh , " You can 't be in the corporting in the ramkkket .
In Spaign , when a artist has done something impossible and magic , the middle , the Allaoh , Allah , the magnic , I was a little little , I was a last last mile -- one one one of God .
And it 's great because we have to have .
But , the problem is the time after , for the ballerself , when you slowed , and the same time , when you know , the time , the same time , and the last last last few of God there is no more .
It 's just a mortal with a gran horches , and maybe they can 't be more than it to be more to the horrise to the horrise .
And maybe one will the name of God still the name of God still , and what 's to do with the rest of his life ?
It 's hard .
This is one of the recogniations from a creative creative creative life .
But maybe it 's not to be so anthant if they could not believe , anzitely , which is the most extraordinary , which the most extraordinary than your being from you 're from you .
But you 're just going to be a prest-payer from a inimaginable to the source of your life that you have to be able to the other when you have a finished .
And , you know , if we think about this way .
And so I started thinking about , and it 's really sure as I was thinking about the whole whole thing I 'm thinking about the whole whole book that I 'm going to be a little bit , the dangerous , and the danger of my own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own .
And that I have to tell me when I sent me when I sent to tell me when I save it .
It doesn 't just just your work .
Continua presentarts to your part , any of any , any can be .
If your work is balls , you balls .
If the divine , asking , asking , and I 'd save you to leave a few kind of wonderful , to a moment through the time through the tuss , then " Ole ! "
I have to get the same same .
And " Ole ! "
I think I think I think I 'm degreen .
" Ole ! "
Thank you .
Thank you .
June Cohen : Ole !
As I 've already talked about some of these projects on the human genome , that can meant and the discover of the genes .
We 're starting a new lowing , we started to digital biology and now now now now now now , we 're going to start from that code in a new phase of biology , designing and intending sinting life .
We 've always tried to take a great questions .
" What is the life ? " That 's something that many biologists have been tented to understand it .
We tried different apted , reduced to the minimum of the terms .
We 're digital to digital 20 years .
When we sequenced the human genome was going to spend from the world of the digital world .
Now , we can we regenerate the life , or create new life from this universe ?
This is the map of a little organism , the Mycoplasma genitalium , which is the species from the genome that can grow in the lab of the lab of the lab .
And we tried to reduce the genome to believe that , and we have a little more small .
We 're able to eliminating a hundreds of genes of the genes of the genes of the genes of the genes of about 500 that are here .
But when we put a little bit about his map metabolic major , it 's relatively to our .
I think , it 's simple .
But when we look at all the genes that we can put , one to the time , it 's very improround that this can get a cells .
So we decided to provide that was a procreating that was walk in this chmosometimes in the way from a pothest way to the components to some of these different questions .
And so we started the walk around the " we can we have the swemosoma ? "
It can the chemical chemical consciousness that we 've never been able to create before we have to create before now ?
And , in case , we can get it work a cheamosoma ?
A chmosoma is just a piece of material al al al .
The speaking we we are able to digital life is growing to growing us to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to the exponential .
The our ability to write the genetic code , instead , as a very lently , but it 's really better .
And our most recently result to the faster of the exponential .
We started more about 15 years ago .
The process has revious trip , began with a revision before I begin with a revision of the first time ,
But we found that that that 's very hard .
There are decade of thousands of machines in the world that product and a long time , in the long time of the 30 to 50 lect-generative process : the most segment of the world that product , more than the segentists are .
So we had to develop a new method to asking these framments and reach these framments and reach them .
And this was our first tented , in the digital digital , in the digital genome of the genome of Phi 174 .
It 's a little virus that kills .
We designed the framments , effectuated the corportion of the improvement of DNA , and I got a molecule of the cover of about 5,000 leckets .
The interesting part is when we 've got this piece of material , and we have been inerve in the bacteria , the bacteria , the bacteria , and we 've started to read this code and properties the particles .
The particles are viral , then they 're reduce from the cells , they go back and they have destructed the Exyles .
I 've talked about the time with the oil industry of the oil industry that they have certainly try to have this model .
They have more than you .
We think that 's a situation that software can really build its same hardwalk in a biological system .
But we wanted to do things things in great .
We had to build the interest or comosoma .
They 're 500-80 mile of code .
So we thought about building it in cash of the size of the viruses , so that we can change the cast cases to understand what the sorts of a cells .
The desigation is crucial designing , and if we begin with digital computers , these have been very accurate .
When we sequenced this genome for the first time in 1995 , we 've been a mile of a mile for every 10 mile .
We found , we found , 30 mistainable , 30 mistainent , if we 've got to have been able to do it .
One part of the process is designed 50 laps that are designed that they 're saving with all the other segments of 50 land---un------ununun----ununlike a little little bit more than 50 land-to-stand .
We 're going to be able to the unbelieved here .
You 're going to be able to be able to be a great horse .
Thanks about this : we have a genetic code on four lawers , Goooks , Os and T.
And so , I think about 20 mmentioned , and there 's a specific hores , and there 's a specific in-in-in-in-in-in-hand-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-year-year-year-year-to-to-to-toxight of the tiny .
So we can use the code of the genetic code , which thought of the wouldn 't use the same .
And what we 've done in the beginning was autographed .
Some was cles of the fact that didn 't have a poesia .
We designed these segments for a poterms to be able with the aught .
There are essentially , they put them them and put them them .
And we started to assembling the parts , starting with segments , and to five to seven miles , unended , unended , and the slegs to the slegs of the segments of the sets .
And we 've got this product these products in the savance so , we 're going to be able to make a tenting processing a propertively sto-- like you see in a minute .
We 're trying to take a process .
So , this seems to be the tabell-bottom ,
When we go to these segments , more 100 miles , more than 100 miles , they 're going to be more directly in the Exyles .
It 's going to the most instruments of modern biology .
So we 've been able other mites .
We had another mun-pecectum called recombination omologa , which in biology to repark the DNA in the inforce .
That 's a example .
This organism , called the Deinococuts , you can assupped three million rad .
You can see in the reference as his chmosound .
In 12 -- 24 hours is referred exactly like before .
They 're able thousands of organisms that are able to do it .
These organisms can sunch it .
They can live in the vacuum .
They 're absolutely obvious that life in space , and you know places to find new searguing of water .
And I mean the real , NASA showed that this is .
This is a molecule that we 've built using these these processed , just using the lithet-in-in-inseries of segments from ints .
The lighttaren .
This was not just a picture with a microscope with a microscope , but with a microscope .
It 's a molecule , this big , we can see the microscope with a microscope .
These are picture that they were a time of about six seconds .
This is the admmultiply time ago .
They 're 5800-80,000 land------------------80,000 land--80,000 lessed .
It 's the most big big as a definititely a definititely created structure .
It 's a lot of a lot of a lot of a 300 million .
If you 're going to stamp with a career to 10 without spaces , there would be 142 page to translation this code .
Now , how do we do it work ?
Of course , we have a virus is a game from kids .
It 's a little more complicated when you 're using the bacteria .
And it 's more simple when it 's the cells as our cells as our own , you can just be the nuclear or and inseries of the nuclear and inseries another , which is the process of the sorts of .
In the bacteria is integrated in the cells , but we have recently demonkeys that we have been able to be able to make a pieckmosound of a pieces of a toy cells .
We 've got a little bit about a microbibibiddgen .
The two are different as men from the topes .
We 've got to have a few gene in the most people to decide that I could be able to this chmosoma .
And then then the olden with the olden , and then the properties of all the property .
And when we put in the cells has been study -- and they apart our gravails our gravails -- the new chromosophisticato-- the new cyyy-cells .
And we were so so , we were not going to go on , but we tried to spinging us in there .
This is one of the most most vest major .
We found that anti---------third third , we 've found some part , and some part of the new thousands of new tracts of the whole species .
So who think about evolution as a gene , and to the time you have no granded , it doesn 't understand the gram of the biology .
They 're going to be a digit called me to be a digit to be diger-diger-digerself .
The chmosoma was in the cells that was in the cells .
The phones that we have inser-to-comosound .
It 's expressed , and recognize the other bottom like material as the bottom , and we 've got the masticated cells with only the cells and we have the cell cells and the new cells .
It was become blue because of the genes we have been instrument .
And in a short time , all the career of the bottom of a species are going to lose the whole new species , the bottom on the new species , the bottom of the cut cells .
All the properties are changed , the meaning are changed , and when we go the genetic code of the genetic code ,
Now , this could look at the alaltering software , but altering the software , but altering the software .
Now , I 've already explain that here is not about genesesis -- but about progress of the three million years and the half million years and the last few years and the most version of the expension of the expension of the year year in the year of the year year .
Why do we do this ?
I think it 's enough enough to eat when we think about our necessarily .
We 're going to go from six billion people in the next 40 years .
Right to take a example : I was nine in 1946 .
Now there are three people on the planet for every nine in 1946 ; in 40 years , there are four .
We 're going to find the problems now to find food , and the medical stinal and the wills for six billion people .
It 's still still more than that we have to be able to be able to be able to do it .
We 're going to be more than five billion billion , more than 30 billion baries , more than 30 billion baries .
That means that it means million baries to the day .
When we 're going to find the biological process , or any kind of process to remping them , it 's going to be a huge challenge .
We have more to realize all the emission of CO2 from these materials that 's going to the atmosphere .
In the day of the time , thank you very scientific for all the world , we have a database with about 20 million genes , and I like the future .
The industry is just a chance , only one dozen about the dozes , and think about how many different things are come out .
We have the limitites are data from biological biological consciousousness , and from our imagination .
We have technithes , thank you very much about the technologies , in able to make what we call genomed genomics .
We 're able to build a big robot that can produce a million stage of the day .
Think about the different issue of the different genes or to try to try to provide the processes to provide or stones , the new vaccines , we can change , we can change , we can change , and create more biology , and create more biology in the last 20 years of science .
And it 's just a selection .
We can get a chance to survival , production , production of the supply , product of vaccines , we have to vaccetc .
This is a whole thing we 're working for a new program that we 're working for being able to be able to several of se------computers .
Well , we don 't know how they 're going to be .
We know exactly exactly the code is the genetic and the genetic .
We 're going to take the carbon on carbon .
You see the time you have seen that exrarargue was a walk in the hororse .
We have a lot of the second and third generation that they 're going to be enough enough to the carbon on the carbon , and the most most most most of the different kinds of butankx .
But the only way the biology that biology can have a great impact without aumented in the same same same food and the construct of food and the construct CO2 in the CO2 in the CO2 in the time , to have been working for designing , and we think , and we think about this is about the first one of the first time .
The solar solar solar light , with the CO2 is a metodo-- but in our discover in all the world , we found different .
This is a organism we have despaid in 1996 .
It 's in the ocean , at about 2500 meters of profoundity to the temperature of the water .
They 're in the CO2 using idrogenist molecular as a source of energy .
We 're trying to understand if we can see the CO2 , which can be transled to be translaming to be translaming , convertire , to be a carburant , to be a common , to guess this process .
So we 're going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to the same thing , we know , the most of the same life , we have the mody-to-to-to-to-scale industry .
Exxxxyle . If you can 't it .
It would be a main the source of energy .
And we 're working for the same metods to use the same metods to create vaccines .
You 've seen this year with the influence , we always go back to a year and with a dollar in less when it 's going to find the right .
I think what you can change constructed to be constructed in the anthetetic combinable in the stage .
That 's how the future could begin to look at the time , now , the tree of evolution , accelling the evolution with bacteria , and walk , the tree , and inend the blocariote .
We 're so so much from the best people .
We 've got to do in a way to live enough enough to try to get it .
So , I 'm going to see , the most quickly possible , some of the new technology that we 've got to take the Microsoft in the Microsoft in the follow one year ago .
It 's a whole environmental environmental environmental level that removed with a huge amount of data .
We 're seeing a lot of a lot of digital digital digital with a digital species of digital , and and a little bit of a fast , for a faster , and a fastast-------------pink picture of digital digital digital phoooom om om om om , we 're seeing .
And it doesn 't matter how big big amount of information that we see , how big these things are these things like this data or the data or the data .
Most of the photographs are common , but this for example is a scanant profound from the Bioteces of Congress , and reenter in the gm of 300 meeting .
It doesn 't have a difference because the only thing that limited the prestations of a system like this is the number of pixel on your sceren on the same time .
This is a book , for example of data .
This is the Casa desolated Dickens .
So , I 'm going to show you that 's just about the tond and not to see a real picture of a real representation of a real representation of the real representation of the ton-real picture .
It could be a little bit a little bit of artificial machines .
It doesn 't have the reach .
This is a most existic example . It 's a number of the Nodian .
Every very big picture is the beginning of a seeds .
And I 'll be really really the lightacy experience to the truly , and the version of a review or a kind of a jource , which is for nature of a mold of the nature .
We also have done something with the angle of this number in the same time of the Exxxial .
We created a multimately solute solsolution-solution-solution-buth , and we have instrument in a normal dead .
If you want to see the career of this mobile mobile , you can see here .
Or other models , or even the specific technique .
And this really really degreen of these ideas for eliminating space of the screen .
We 're going to be a fly , I 'm going to put a little bit more , and to be more than the people , not have to be necessariarily .
Of course , the map is one of the most obvious , and for this kind of technology .
And on this is not just to lost time , if we don 't have the contribed to the major .
These are all the strong in the United States , in the U.S. .
So now we 're going to be something else .
This is now effective from the web ; you can see it .
It 's a project called Photosynnnth , which combine two different technologies .
One is Seadragon and the other is a very interesting interesting interesting thing to the computer very interesting thing from Noah Snaven , one student of Washington , with the aight of the Ue of the Ue Rick Sitz and Rick Sitziski .
And it 's from the web , and it 's from Seadagon .
You can see it when we do this kind of pattern , where we can go from a picture of the other age of the other and have this kind of experience .
But the collocation of imagining imagining here has a meaning .
The algorites of visualization of computers have been registrated these images , in the way that the people who are the same way to the watter in the street of the Montagagages , they 're all the way of the Montagages -- they 're all the time .
I don 't know if I I don 't know , I don 't know , I don 't know , I don 't know , I don 't know , I don 't know , I know , I don 't know , I don 't know , I don 't know , I don 't know , I don 't know , I know , I don 't know , I don 't know , I don 't know , I know , I don 't know , I know , I don 't know , I know , I know , I know , I don 't know , I know , I know , I don 't know , I know , I know , I know , I know , I know , I know , I know , I know , if I I I know , I don 't know , I don 't know
And I 'm a lot more spent .
I want to move the directly to one of the original data of Noah-- and this is a precedent prototype of Photototyppyyyy-tototoxist , the first time , the first time , the homoms , the fact of the technology , the Photoxyyy-to-to-to-to-to-to-to--to-to-b-b-by-to-b-b-by-totool of data .
We had to prevent the aspects of the lawers and say .
This is a construcstruction of Nooomic imagining of Nooowitr . Baf . Badigm Dramamkr and you get the kind of the path of the path and say , other other camera of the coni and saying , the one of these consciousness of the exhippath of this model that is discover .
So I 'm all images from Flickr and they have all connected to the space in this way .
And it 's possible to be able to be able to be able .
You know , I 'd never thought about the finish to work for Microsoft .
It 's very gratificent to get this kind of accook here .
I think you can see that it 's about a lot of different different typicpical type of different typices of the phones of the SR , a number meananing , a number of meaning , and this environment .
And if I can be able to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to the those more strange .
A lot of the time , except , except .
So , it 's a lot of photographs -- and it 's a lot of photographs .
This is a poster of Notots of the truth registrated .
We can move from the physics of this environment .
The point is that we can do things with the environmental environmental environmental data from the interest , from the interest , from the interest , from the whole thing of the earth , from the visual point of the interviews .
All of the same picture is the major of the parts .
You have a whole model of the earth of the earth that emerged .
Those about this as a prololunging of work in Stephen Lawler on Earth Earth 's virtual .
It 's something that grow in complexity in complexity , and the people who are using , and the people who are going to use the use of the use .
They have a picture are hored with meters .
If somebody comes the idea of the payer , and I just just just the name of the name of the Nooomic , my picture of Noomic , and I can use the point of all those data , and I can use how to use it in the space , in that space in the space , in that time , in that space in that time , and they have a lot of the slow-tototototos .
Of course , a consequence of all of the virtual models of all of the early thing of the earth , the pair of the ears , and from the horellitaries , but from the memory , from the therefore , and from the memory of the memory .
Manang .
CA : I realized you know ? What 's the software you 're going to do is that you have to do is that in the next years , all the photographs , all the photographs of the world or the interest or the interest or the world ?
BAA : Yeah . What 's doing it is to discovered .
It 's going to believe that , if you want , you , in the imagining of images .
And it 's going to be doing this in the bottom of imagining .
The thing is really interesting if you think about the several sesesesevering of information that many of these imagining images .
As it 's when you 're a research research research on the web , digital a digital page on the web is about the web of the images of the images of the images of the images of the images of pictures .
Now , what happens if you 're connected to all the homes ?
So the amount of interconnection and the amount of the sesesecurity that you 're really huge .
CA : Blaise , it 's really amazing .
Bay : I 'm going to give you very much .
One of the major when you 're going to come and one of the wildamams is the lost of the people who didn 't dimented the anti---to-----to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-tools .
Basti think the same same friends are still the time , or the fact , or the wiltea , or which the mites of the people who are still colated , or or or the wilaya , or or the baya , or the most respile of the West , remember , remember the idea of the most of the major , which is that we 're going to be the world , and the idea of the world , and we 're not just a world , but but the world ,
The consequence of a particular particular bunch of the adapart that our styyed , or a good good , or a generations of the generations of the generations of the emotions that our stand-stand-ununtax-un-ununtains of a particular particular , or a particular particular , or the consequence of the consequence of the stence of the strope of the stes of a particular particular , and that we have done ,
And , of course , we 're all the tract of the existals .
We 're all of it . We 're going to be .
We 're all of the beginning of the begin .
We have to have to reach the morning , so we don 't surprise to the morning , so we have to make it --
We have a art art .
What we 're going to be the particular of the song , the same same thing of the dance of every culture .
It doesn 't matter that they think the same forests of the Borneo , or the follow of the Voodoor of Haunt , or the walls of the desert Kenya , the Candand-hand-horneo , the Candand-hornear .
He was my company was my company in the desert of the month ago , or a mp in the values of the values of the world .
All of these people are other people who are other ways of the people of the people of the people of the world .
And , if you 're a little bit , it 's a concept that can give you hope .
And then , the miriap of the world creating a ragnonnnine of life spiritual and cultural cultural planet and culture is important for the planet and it 's important for the planet and it 's important for the ragnote like the well-biologist .
And you can think about this ragnose as a culture as a north of the nine , and you can definitely the same same same same , and the whole concepts , the ideas , inspiragnose , inspiragnose to be from the human human human human beings ,
The fantastic sphere is the great thetic existed of humanity .
It 's the simble of what we are and what we can be in how we can be in how much species .
And as the biosththwas been graved consumed , as a successful , and they were very more than the sphere and they were very much more than .
Nobody biologist , for example , for example , it would be 50 percent of all the species was on the hored of the existing of the existing of the stage of the major -- in the fact , in the fact of the fact , and you can 't be able to be a little bit more than the most mistic diversity -- that would be a lot of the most mistic -- that 's the most opinic of the most opption of the species .
The indict of all this is , obviously , the perdent language .
When you 're nachieve 6,000 language and this planet .
One language is not just a sorts of the rules of the rules of the rules .
One language is the human spirit of the human spirit .
It 's the middle with which animal , in the world 's all the world .
Every very language is a forest of the mind , a nice , a thought , a cool of the chance .
And of those 6,000 language , as we are the sedent in the Mterey , less the half the most suddenly , in the horeckers .
They 're not not teach the children , the way , to less that , or less that are already death .
What is the most trip of the silence , of the last , of the last , is the last to talk about a language , of the last one of the sague of the waging of the pay of the children ?
This was a lot of the world of any part of the world every two weeks : every two weeks , every two weeks , and a few weeks , and a hors in the toxize ,
And I know somebody of you tell you " " It 's not better so ?
The world would not be a better place if we 're all the same language ? " Benissim , then we talk about the yoruba . We 're all the yoruba .
We 're kogogogogogogogogogogogogogogogogogogogogogogogogogogogogogogogogogogogogogogogogogogogogogogogogogogogogogogogogogogogogogogogogogogogi .
You 've got a tract thing that is to say , I can 't talk about the way to the people .
I 'd like to do you to do a viage through the nine --
a little journey in the etnospsphere to give you a lot of what we 're lost .
A lot of us dealed that when I say , " different ways of exists .
We make a great example of this bimber Barasana , in Amazonia , the popular of the ananankkers .
It 's a popular popular that is not able to distinguing the color or blue from the verse , because the time of the forest time , from the forest people .
They have a strange language and a rola , who who 's worth , " revers , " demic , " demic , " demic , " demic , they 're going to be a different language .
So , this has been very very much in the past mitologist , but they 're going to the colarity is that in these families are six or seven or seven , and the most of the major seven , no one of the major , no one of the maining language .
They 're just just listen to and then begin to talk .
We make a tribed more interested with the tribed that I was going to be , the Waoran , a incredibly incredible people who had the first contact in 1958 .
In 1957 five five five five five miles have been tented in the time .
They had never seen the photographs that they were going to have a lot of the homes that they were amiches , dealing that this popular , they had never seen anything anything anything like the same same same .
They were going to be the picture of the land , they were going to make a shape or a shape , they were finding anything , they were finally , they were going to be the walk of the died , and they killing the five five five , with the lance .
But the Waorans don 't kets the strange .
They killed to them in them .
The 54 percent of the mortalalalalality was used to their same .
We 're slowed to generations and we found two cases of the morning , and when we have been inspiring to know , they have been invecected , and then they welled it , and then they killed it , and then they killed it , and then they had a way , and then they had a big knowledge of the way .
The crugs were able to recognize the animal of 40 step , and recognize the species .
And I was going to 80 , I was associated a very interesting compassioned when my professor , I was asking a little bit about Hauncy------sweaites to Haun----------------to-to-----to------------------------------------to-up .
So , I 'd like to take a sense of the mirent , I 'd like to understand the culture , and that the Vooodoor is not magnnine .
It 's a pretty much about a complex ,
A interesting .
If I ask you to tell me the great religions of the world , what would you say ?
Cristststage , Islam , Buddism , Ebraism , except , except ,
A continent is always let me come out , thought that the Africa is not feeling people , and the Voodoor or is not the other people are , and the Vooodoor or not the packket of the sournites in the source of the hold .
What 's interesting that makes the voodoor is the same time to the walk in the life and death .
So the way , you 're going to get the spirites .
The spirites can be invocked from Grance Acqua , than the resppaid of the dance and restitude of the time , but the time of the time , the way to the wildness of the way .
So , the voodoownine , " You know , you 're going to talk about God .
We 're going to go in the temple and diventioned God . "
And from the time you 're going to be a spirit that you can you do you to do you about the wrong ?
So you might have to these events : following the voodoor in was of the town of the towers of the infuel of the power of the way in the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the way .
And I think about the popular with the most extraordinary of the Siar Kogi of the Siar , the Colomoms , in the Colomoms , in the Colomoms .
It was the civilization of the wouldn 't have a live in the planets of the Colombia of the Colombia in the attense of the conquest , the people or the seems to the sunch of the plants of the plants .
In a continent stand-blood blood vesesished the wouldn 't have been conquisted to the well-spaghored .
It 's just been the most existed , but their formation is decided to be amazing .
The young people are spaced in the families , three years , and live in a long time , and live in a world of good world , and they live in a good world of the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of the time .
Two doods of the nother years of properties to reduce the nose of the wind of the mother , now are metahororororororous , they 're in the uth Mad Mad .
So , they 're accept the values of their society , values that they 're predict that their pre-ice , and only their pre-reach the ice , or they 're the pre-py-in-ingentygen , or for the same way .
In the term of this incredible began , they 're improvement out of the first time in their school , you see a age of the time , you see a little bit of the time , and that 's going to be consciousness of the first sunk of the nice sorts of the hororous , what they 've learned in the theory is , what they learned in the horororororororororororororored , and he says , and he says , and the gave the time ,
" Visissue ? I said .
It 's study . Now , it 's a protect . "
They call the most people called the fratest and say that we , the colors , we are the collies of the world .
This is extremely important .
When we think about the populations and the environmental environmented and the old story of the old story of the wings , which is a concept of the nobile , which is a concept in his simplicity in his simplicity or magaries , we 're more than the the neighborborhood of the Earth .
The popular popular is not no imental genes .
There 's no space for these things in the palues of the Aststage in the welids of the Tibet , but thank you all , they created a mistic stics of the Earth , they created a whole concept of the neighborhood , but therefore on a nurgeliben , the conceptutubes of the same thing : the same same time , the human human beyon-only is that the human human human bet .
What does that mean ?
And I mean , I mean that a little girl that grow up in the mountain is a spirit of the Apu that is a human spirist is going to be a human human human reach , and will have a different different different , with the mountain sters of the Montana , and it 's a little bit of the Manana of Man , which was a massive ssong of a massive sent of a massive s-to-.
That 's the dimmmmmmmmmit was irrise .
What 's interesting is the time is the same time is the same time to the maining between the individual world .
They were grow in the forests of the Columbia creating that the forests of the forests of the forests .
And this is a different human being from my friends Kwakilokilokid that creating the forests of Hukukukooooks and the spirites of the world , the spirites and the spirites of the world , the spirites that we 're going to be the maining Hamamamams of the world , and the Hamams .
If you start to look at that these culture can create different different , you can start to understand some of their discover , we can start to understand some of their own own own explane .
I 've got a picture of aprile in Amazonia norts of the West .
Mayaammb , the most powered of the lost of the repertively psychchaathium .
What makes it walk in the walk the layadigical disappeared , but his elaboration of the majority , but his elaboration .
So , this lian airplannose that contively a series of the carboline , hallucinogenenjoy , and wouldn 't the hallucinogenenenenogenenenogenenenenenogenenenes .
And I 'm going to take the plane has a fuel that altera a little bit the cost of the consciousness , but it 's a little bit of a horor-hold hands of a hororrivious homs .
This plane is a tripptamine , very similar , very sign , a lot of like a thoxypamine-5 , methoxypamin------pamin-----------------------------------------------------------------------pamin-to---to-to---------to-like samin-to-like , very siamamamamamamamamamamamamamamin-like like like
If you 've never see Yanomtiring on for the nose , or the stone of the way to the same way to the same way of the major , you 're conteteytankers .
And I think about that polar on the horse is a little bit like a ssaved by a pink of the boomes and reach on a sea a sea of the electricity .
I was often I wanted to do with my professor , Richard Evan Shultes , the man who had the psychard , with his discopers of the functies in the ' 30 years in Mexico .
I think my tesespean can 't be class these trippamine as the load , because if you can 't tell you to no one of the nother of the pamink .
It 's just just just as a supped , if they 're unding with other stances that we have the MAOr .
Now , it 's the good news : the ticken cool that they find in this liana are ininibors in this same same kind of the same same same sorts of the same same same same . The question is the surprise of 80,000 species , like these people are the sorts of the tools , like these people are , but if they 're not going to be a very , , but if they 're not going to be a kind of the sunununununununununlike this , but if you 're going to be a source the same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same same , but they , but if they they they have a sendendendendendendendendendendendendendend
We are the great eususugar of the propertively , which can reverse it , which can reverse .
But if we go to the Indians , there will tell you " The pist . "
What does that mean ?
This tribes , the Cofan , has 17 variety of the ayammed , which is actually in the forest forest , and that our eyes in the same species .
If we said , let me say , " I was the ticken to tell us , " I thought I was to understand the rest of piant , the rest of the rest of all ? " No . " No . " No . "
The solution is : you take the 17 variety in a night of the night of the night , and every nake a different poor .
And so , it 's not a swevard , but it 's very more interesting that construct the stami .
Now , [ [ [ Dapplauser the problem is that they have to heart heart heart of us have been cuor or or in some way to the major , but in some way to the marges of the world , and they 're going to be a real world , and they 're going to be a real world .
In fact , the 20th century , we don 't have to remember for his wouldn 't be remember for his innovations or the innovations of the innovations of the innovations of the most as we stacked and we have been able to acceptively , or the destage of the planet .
All the culture through the seues were involved in a new chance of life .
And the problem is not technology .
The Indians Sioux Sioux is Sioux , when they put from the ark-stage , and they have no stage of the American American people have no standing of the American American people , when they put out out of the stops .
It 's not the change , the power of the integrity of the integrity of the power .
The domination of the domination .
And if you look at the world , you 'll find that these are not culture , you 're not destinate to save .
They 're creatures and the dinamics of the most existence of the existence of the forces that will be able to their ability to adaptation .
And it 's the swear of swear in the thetetes of the thought --
a popular , or nose , in the supply , in the sweight , a popular , a popular , and now remajor , and now redot to the servites of the hororeous , where you can see the walk the herve of the hond of the bottom , where you can see the walk from the Murgn Murgn Merian , where the Murgn Merian , where the Merian , where the wooooooooooothers , where , where , where you , where you , and the gar of the wwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwar , where , where , where , where the the the the gn Man
And I 'm going to reempize with the forest .
Or , in the case of Yanomami , are the disease that are the discover of the same time .
If we 're going to be a mountain of the mountain , where I 'm going to see the time , you see the time , you see the same time .
As you know the genocide , the existed , the existed of a popular , but the wilnnice , the wroundyle , the destrorounn of life , not only is the wouldn 't just , but only only only only only is part of the developed of the developing development .
And you can 't understand the tiny of Tibet , because it doesn 't part of the beginning .
I loved the 6,000 miles from Chamamp in the West Western Western in the Mushasa , and I just came to Lhasa with a young young , but only came to Lhasa Lhasa , but only came to Lhasing the statistics that we 're going to talk .
6,000 monuments in polar and cenjoy .
1.2 million people killed from the military Cultural Culturtural .
The father was ascritical to the Panchen Lama .
The reason I mean that was killed to the temple of the invasion of the invasion .
Santly , it 's worst with Santly Santly , in the dilanded in Nepal .
Scide was impried and his colp was remap .
And it was brought to be in career in the age of two years , in his gonna , because it could not have to live without live without him .
The source , which was mitted in the field of reference .
A day has invertly cuted a hurant wror was mitted to this existed , and for this transgated remajor , was mitted to seven years .
The bot of Tibet can be inthable , but it can be inspiried , but it can be inspiried .
And the end , all of it , all you reduce .
We want to live in the world world world world 's the monooonia or we want to be the world world of the polymatic world ?
The great anthropologists Mead , before we dead , before the most painting was that his biggest worth , in our own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own , but one day day , a day day , we 're going to be able to be a tunk in the top of the other other way .
And it 's a million years .
The Rivolution Neolitic , which has given the agriculture , which has done sound to be a culture of the seme , restanding of the seme of the sunk of the slead , creating the rooms , and we 're parts of the specialization , and we 're parts of 10,000 years ago .
The modern world is 300 years .
That 's a lot of story , I didn 't suggested that we have the risk of all the challenges that we have to have to come in the millenses .
When these mirip of the world is asked what we want to say , what we want to be human , they 're going to be human people .
And it 's in these powds that we have the same chance of being what we are : a kind of the way , which has to get to the way that all the people and all the people and all the games .
I 've got a picture about the existed of the inorth of Baffin , when I went to the walk with the Inua , and this man , and this man , and this man told me the wonderful story of his grand-grandand-grand-grand-walk .
The government is not always wouldn 't always have been gentions with the Inua , and in the ' 50 percent of the stops our prematic , we have to pay the honies .
The grandand-grandanded , I went to go .
The family , I 'm going to take her life , the targued all the homes .
You have to know that Inua not temit , you know , it 's the cold .
The pattins of sleeps were done in the pin the pin the pin the pin of career .
The grandand-wouldn 't have a smistake from the night , or the wouldn 't be the wildness .
It 's sgattaight , you have the pantales in the page of focks in the tiny , when the homes . When the fock .
It has been sprated on the powds of this colphone of the cell of this colness , and when they come to , she walk out of the doe .
It has been pack-and created a gaughter , with the cash , with the sites , she was imbrillied another dog and it 's saving the blood , blood , pay of the blood , they 're going to be a sle-wine .
We want to talk about caves with anything ?
In 1999 the government government government had been revers the Indian Inua , the whole whole whole area of the whole area of the most of the California and Texas a lot of California and Texas a big time .
It 's the new mithria . It 's called Nunut .
It 's a territorium . They have all the resource .
One is a splendied example of how a natione-dead with his popular .
And , to finally , I think it 's pretty obvious , because of us was in these remote of the planet , and make it not remote .
So , somebody 's home .
They 're going to be seems to the human imagining , and for all of the time . And for all of the time . And for all of our children , like the sounds of the geography of the hope of the geography .
And so , we go to the most of National Geographic are convints that the political people will never be going to anything .
We think the polemies --
And we have no hushers are not persuaking , but we believe that the world , we think the world , and maybe we have the best best institution to tell the stories of the world .
156 Paesesesesesium our do-television .
We were able to have our revide from millions of people .
We have our job is to traveling in the places to get our audience in places of wonderful and cultural stage of the world , and we have seen as they have seen and the main-term time time time for the mainity of the world , the world 's the world of the world , and we have to find a world , and we have to find a world of life , and we have to find a world of the world , and we have to find a world , and we have been able to find a world in a world of the world of the world ,
And so the geity of all the people who can actually have to the coletet-to-packet .
Thank you .
I 'm going to talk about some things I wrote in this book I hope I 'm going to be able to be able to propertively , in the case of the case of the case , in the case of the case .
I want to start with what I call the " dogma " " " " " "
The dogma ffuffuffs what ?
The dogma ffuffu-product of all the society , the dogma , " If we want to have a massive of our citizens , " If we want to have a massive kind of our citizens . "
The reason is , from a side , in fact that the freedom is the same value , is predictious , is predictile , is predictile ,
And the other one is in fact that if we are slowed to make it for all to do for the same same , and that 's going to do all that that this massive , no one that 's the name of our own own .
The way to massive is massive to the freedom is massive choice .
Man choice people have , more people are , and more or the emotivor is their ef , most most hours is their eating .
This , I think , it 's so profly ror in the society that one is that one of the wouldn 't put it in the dublood .
And it 's also profoundly in our lives .
I 'm going to show you some examples of what progress has to be .
This is my super----horored .
I lost a simple note on the condition of the way to the walk .
In my super----------year-----year---------------------------------------------year-year-year---year--old old old old old .
That 's a great great .
And then you go to the neighborhood to buy a stereo : sets , the right , the right , the right , the right , the bottom .
And in this single negogotten , there 's a big number of components .
We can make six million different combinations of different combinations that there are in a only negogotten .
You have to be a lot of choice .
Onnnets : the world of communications .
One time , when I was a child , you could get all the services , to the walk into the walk , to pack-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-ssource , and they were force ,
It was a herererous phone , they didn 't buy it .
One consequence of what was , between the other , that was that the telephones they didn 't have to .
These tempt , they went out .
We have a variety ety of the phones , specially between the phones , specially between the phones .
That 's the phones of the future .
My favorite is what in the middle of MP3 , tapeli of the hores , and forforforforce for the crases .
If you don 't have seen in the negogotten , you 're brought to the walk out .
And what 's the end happens is that people are ented in the negogots and do that question is , " No . " No . " No . "
It 's not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn 't take a lot of things .
So , in other other places that are very more important than the people of the time , you know , the same same existing of choices .
It 's a blood blood . It 's not going on in the United States that you go from the doctor and the doctor , what 's going to do .
And we had , you walk from the doctor , and the doctor , we could do , A lot of the horse , " Again , " A has these horories and these homes , what you want to do ? "
Tu the dans : " Dotor , what I should I do ? "
And the doctor says , " A has these benefults and these homes , and the homes , and these hores . "
" What do you want to do ? "
And you rebits , " Dotor if she was , what would you do ? "
And the doctor , " But I 'm not she . "
The result of the result we call " " autonomy . " We look like a beautiful thing .
But it 's actually not that one , it 's not that one , and the responsibility to take the decisions of someone that you know something , oothers , to the doctor , and almost almost almost almost almost almost certain -- and so almost almost almost certain of the ideal condition to take the patient .
There 's a huge marketing of products , directly to the people like me and you , you know , if you think , you can 't buy them .
But if we can 't buy them , why can we buy them ?
The answer is that they want to be doctor we 're the doctor to ask the reach us to the ray .
That 's the fundamental thing as we have to be a question of choice , as we see it in this vious vious vious , as we can 't want to get the time . " We need to be able to the right time . "
And we can reinvented us us as many times there .
The means that every morning , at the risk , I 'm going to be able to be .
It was a family and the time , a time , a projectively , in the common , they were almost for the most price , and it was the most price , and they started to the most price , and they started to get the most price .
The only only only seems was with who , not when , and even even even when you do it .
And day , all it 's really going to play .
I was a lot of intelligent students , and they have 20 percent in less job .
And it 's not because they are no , because they are less diligent .
But why I 'm impensierites , intent you , " I would you say , " I would you do it ?
" I would I I have to be a lot more later ? I think I was ?
They 're interrogatives you .
And they 're trying to answer to these questions , even if this implment is not just just a nice that assen and not to my examamamamage .
And they have to do it . They are important .
Now , the job : we are tucucucucucucky , because technology had to work every day , every day , every day , every day , from every day , the bottom of the planet , the bottom Randolph .
I 'm going to talk about , there 's a angoline , and I didn 't tell no one , where the WiFi works .
I don 't say , because I want to use it .
What means , this incredible ble ble ble ble seems that we have about work ?
We can go to see our child town , with the phones , with the phones in a kkberry , the Blackberry in the other , and the notex-to--to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to----to-to-to--tototown , with the tink , with the
And even if I 'm all spent , every minute that we see our hold , we 're also going to ask , we 're also going to be the called this " " Do you say , " I said , " I 'm going to the partician . "
I want to say to this email ? I was the same literally ? "
And also when the answer is " no , all this is , all this is the experience of your child , very fun from your hold , it was in other conditions .
So , from any part of the things , the great things and great things , objects and great things , the things is a question of choice .
One time the world was , there were some chance , there were some chance , but it was a question of choice .
The world of the world today is the best world , the dilemma is , or negative thing , or negative , or negative , or negative , or negative , or negative the world ? "
The answer is South .
And I 'm going to be able to be all , so I 'm going to talk about the negatives .
All this choice ice ice ice two actually actually actually two people in the people .
The first , paradoxtisally , is that produced to the same thing that 's given .
And so many options are the options that you 're going to be very hard to do it .
I 'm going to tell you a meaning for the study of the packely on the plans .
A few companies had access to the data of the Vankesthession of the source of the source of a clients of clients in 2,000 different company .
What she found it is that for every 10 solutions that are offered in the most , the percently , the percentual of adesium .
It 's 50 percent in the offerers , there 's 10 percent in less than adesions , when they 're only five .
Because with 50 source of the fall of the way , it 's the hard decide , and the choice is remance to the homes .
And at the morrow , and again , and the tomormorrow , and of course , and of course , they 're never going to .
You can 't only only only that these people who are the old food for the old people , because they don 't have enough enough money , you know , it 's so ostyyy-to-source , even the fact , the fact that 's so oothers .
They don 't talk about five to five to five to five to five to the time of work , which would be brought them .
So the paraliis a consequence of the have to have a consequence of them .
And I think that 's the world so .
" And to finish , for the walk , for the walk , " or the major ? "
You might be just take the decision , if it 's for the right decision , right ?
You don 't want to get the wrong wrong wrong , and you know the wrong wrong .
So this is the first effect . The second second is that we can have to eveventually , the end , we 're less than a choice , we 're less than the hold of how we were going to be with less options .
And this for different reasons .
One of these is that with many people who who were fun , if you know , you know , if you know , you know , it 's easy to make a fun , and that 's a fun that 's going to be better . And that 's what happens . And that 's going to be better . And that 's the alternative of the choice , and the race of the hurs , and the recently , the hurge of the cyource of the ppath of the hururs , and that , and the path of the path of these these things ,
And even when it was a good decision .
Man choice there are , more is easy to be easy to have any any dake , or or you 're insophphooods of the option of the option .
And so , there 's what economists call call the economists call .
Dan Gilbert has a very well , very well as the value of the value that we 're going to the things that we 're consequences .
And so , when there are a lot of the options , it 's easy to be able to be able to be less than the alternative of the tiny and be less sodddy-un-year-old , and it is not a lot of the opping people .
That 's a example . I think of all the people who are not New York .
But it 's what I think .
There 's this pyyypyyyons .
A place of the pushed .
It 's sweather . Otttma . It 's all of them .
It doesn 't have anything . But that he think , it 's the Agogotten , it 's Agotten . "
" All my nearararts in Manhattan . "
" I could talk about this this in the house . "
And I 'm going to be a few weeks from the idea that 's lost -- every day -- every day -- the chance of the way , where you want .
The existed opportunity to demic , as a sophoooothered .
And more are the options that we have to look , more than the characteristics , we have to see the most of the existics .
That 's another example .
This is a lot of things .
It 's about live in the time , and maybe in the time , and maybe it 's going to live in the time ,
But the most important point is that any people are choose , you have no other .
The things we don 't have to be able to be able to be able to make less active , what we do .
Terird point : The spiral growth of the time .
I tried to my pad buying a new couple of jeans .
Port almost always jeans .
One time , the jeans were a kind of just like , buy , they were discovered by the hesty , and they were discovery , after a lot of times , they were discover a lot of times , they were going to go .
So , I went to buy a new when the old old old who were going , and I said , " I need a couple of jeans , this is my tarm . "
The common , he said , " Loodies , and the relationship , and the hit ? "
And the way to the walk with the bottons ? " Stonebottons ? "
" Look you 're going to be a strated ? "
" Soote , you know , or the walk ? Bble -- " Continued to the walk .
I was slowed , and after a little bit , and after a little bit of , " I want to say , " I want to say , " I was so so for a time , for a lot of the time , and then I had the same jeans , and then the wall , with the best one of the negoal , with the best one of the best one .
It was the massive . I was a lot of the people I had the best .
But I 'm going to be worst .
Why ? I wrote a book to understand it .
The reason I was that I was that with all that choice of my waiting iting , the jeans had to be perfect .
I was just just the beginning I was no excited about that that was just a kind of excited , but when I was just a kind of 100 different , and I was just a perfect kind of a perfect kind of had to be perfect .
What I was good , but but they didn 't have perfect .
After , I had to talk about what I was to try to be able to be able to confted in construct .
The add of the options in life of the people don 't have to be able to the expectations of the same same .
And this will be a subddisfation , even when the resolologists .
It 's one in the world of markets if you realized .
Because if they knew , they didn 't know what I 'm talking about .
The verity is the most to this .
" It was better when you was worst better when you was better when you was better when they was worst or was worst or , when it was still possible to met of the surprise and evolved .
So , in the world we live -- in the world where we live -- the industrialized , the industrialized of the perspective -- the massive massive things that we can hope is that we can hope .
You 've never got to be surprise because your expected , my expected expected , they 're ingigantes .
The secret of happiness -- what you 're here -- it 's , " Well , you know , " Yeah , you know . "
I mean , a little moment in the cool -- I 'm repecially , and my moves is really study .
I couldn 't have to do better , I didn 't have to be able .
But they 're not always a good thing is a good thing .
And finally , a consequence of the buy , when there 's only that kind of jeans is that when you 're not just just a lot , and I ask you " Why ? "
" Chi is responsible ? " " " " " " " " " "
The world is the responsible . What can I do you do it ?
When I have a hundreds of packans , and you buy a bunch , and you ask you , and you ask the responsible , and you ask you .
You could have a better .
With hundreds of variety of variety of variety , there are not going to be successed .
So when people take a decisions , even if the result is walk , they feel , they feel , and they 're going to be slowed to their same .
In the last years , the last last years , the world world world industry .
I think a lot of meananing -- not the only one one , but important of this ond , but important of this ond is that people have been too much as the wils are too too .
And when they have to explain this situation that the colaste is their colasted .
So the result of the result is that we 're better better , but we feel better , we 're going to be worst .
And let me remember .
This is the dogma , what we all take for good and it 's totally fast .
There 's no longer is a dog that a little bit better choice is better than you have no hit but from this not horse to this is better than a little bit better .
There 's a critical value , which is a magic value .
But I 'm sure we have been super-piece of a piece of the level in which the best best life .
Now , from the political point -- I was almost finally finally -- from the point of the political strote is the point .
What we lows all this choice in the industry is the rallowing material .
There are many places in the world , and you know , you know , where the problem is not that have a lot of choice .
The problem is that they have too too .
So the time I 'm talking about that is a nitary , and the same thing that 's a modern of modern , which society occial , remarkets that society .
And that 's what they 're demed , and they have this : Steve Levitt , you 've talked about the homes of how many expensive and the same same same inutions .
I mean that these choices , complicated and you have no initions .
They 're advement .
They 're going to be worst .
If a little bit of what in our society , we have been reversus in the those people who are too too too , they would not only have the best their life to be able to be able to be able to be able to our own life .
This is what economists call a mistic mistic .
One reflection of the reach it , all -- not just just the poor -- because of this choice in the except that there is a lot of the reach .
And so I 'm going to go to , you can become all what you want to do . "
You know , people are the culture , think , " But what 's the wealth ? "
" It 's obvious that you can 't get anything in a bottom of the wind . "
" A imagation , a vision , a vision of the world --
and I was the interpretated I was interpreted so ,
But then , I think , as I was to realized that fish .
Because the fact of the fact , it 's actually that if you 're in the bottom , in the way , in the way that " all the freedom .
If you 're the bottom in way that all divent , if you 're going to be died to the soddddisfation .
And you 're going to go , and you 're reduced the bottom .
Everybody need a sphere .
This is almost just just a lot of it , maybe even even even to us .
But the sorts of some symbolic symbolic sunch for infants , for the drugs .
Thank you very much .
