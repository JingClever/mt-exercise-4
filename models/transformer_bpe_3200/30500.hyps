I showed these devices to show that the slide of the demonstrate that the glacial calotter , which for almost three million years , had the size of 48 United States , it 's been close to 40 percent .
But this underneath the gravity of the problem because it 's not showing the pessor of the ice .
The Arctic ice is , in a sense , the clear of the global climate system .
You expands up to the winter and you retreat the end .
The next slide will be a fast carrelated to the advanced of the last 25 years .
The glacious paces are signed in red .
You see , they 're going to go up to the blue wall .
That 's the ice in winter , which is retreatment .
You can see that the cosidate ice , five years or more , is like blood , which is like blood , which here was from the body .
In 25 years , it 's been past .
This is a problem because the heating interest the path of the glacier around the ocean where there are huge carbon where there are huge carbon congelated that , the melated , are transformed in the microbes .
Right to the totality of the totality of global warming , that amount of global warming could double , overcome this point of not return .
In some of the laghi 's little profound in Alaska the metane is already rebolling from water .
The professor Katey Walter of the University of Alaska , a team in a team , a very low last blow last team .
Video : Wow ! Al Gore : Wow . You know , the question is if we 're going to be .
A reason is that this is that this termical exchange Groenland from the north .
This is a river river to the peace regime .
The brought had never reached to levels .
This is the Kangerlussuaq , in the southwest of the Groenland .
If you want to know how the sea level for the sea for the melting of the glaces on the ground , here is where the sea .
These currents are increasing .
Another of the planet : Antarctica , the biggest block of the planet .
The last month of the scientists have dichieve that the paper is in negative , and that the Antarctica , which poging on some islands , is particularly very quickly in the melt of the mall .
Equital to six feet of the bottom , like Groenland .
Sulil Himalaya , the third bigger block of ice , you see new laghi , which a few years ago , a few years ago ,
40 percent of the world population is half of the world population from the monstration .
Sulle Ande : this glacier is the source of this city .
The brought is increased .
But when you 're decreasing , the same happens to the water .
In California , the nenow on the Sierra Nevada is the 40 percent .
The idricium are in the crisis .
The predictions , as you read , are good .
The growing safterwards , the world leads to a remarkable increase .
The environmental disasters are increasing a rhythm out of the normal and unprecedented .
Four times more numer-year-old numbed in the last 30 years I respect to 75 .
This is a whole is a whole insustainable .
If you look at the context of the context , if they can see the consequences .
In the last five years , we added 70 million tons of CO2 every 24 hours -- 25 million tons of the oceans every day .
Look at the Eastern Pacific , the American , to the west , and to both the parts of the subcontinent , where there is a radical impoverty of oxygen in the oceans .
The major because of global warming , together with the deforestation , which is 20 percent , is the use of fossil fuel fuel .
The oil is a problem , and the carbon is even worse .
The United States are one of two countries with more emissions , together to China .
And it was proposing to build a lot of other cents carbon .
But we 're seeing a way of a direction .
These are the ances of the last few years and some green proposals .
Everyway , there 's a political fight in our country .
The carbon industry and oil have spent 250 million dollars in the last year to promote carbon , which is a oxide .
And I 'm going to remember something --
So , there 's a 3.8 billion lizri of floor .
Maybe you 've seen it on news .
This is the second biggest flow of the flower of the last flow of the last flow of the last flow of the last flow of the last flow of the last flow of the last flow of the fllow of the last flow of the last large flow of the fllow of the last flow of the largest fllow of the last flow of the fllow
It happened around Natal .
The nonononote of one of the carbon industry was this .
Video : I think it 's got the carbon is a kind of allegro and happy .
It 's abundant here in America , and make our economy .
Frosty carbon is more and smaller .
It 's good price , adorable and the workers are the windites .
Al Gore : So , it 's a lot of the West Virginia .
The bigger mineral society on the mountains is Massey Coal . This is his administrator .
Video : With Blankenship : I 'm going to be clear -- Al Gore , Nancy Pelious -- they 're not going to know what they 're talking about .
Al Gore : So the Alliance for Protext of Clima has two campaign .
This is a part of them .
Video : Acore : Actually , ALergy , we see climate change climate change as a sery of our business .
So , our priority is to invest a lot of money in a effort to make public and confused to make public and confused to make public and confused to make public and confused .
In fact , carbon is not pushed .
We think it 's cleaned -- it 's also a good profur .
So , not precupatory of climate change .
Let 's do it .
Video : Carbone : Carbone -- you 've heard a lot of it .
So let 's let 's go through a little bit to a little bit about the carbon .
Straordinary ! The machines are a little rumor , but this is the sound of carbon technology .
The carbon consumption is between the major causes of global warming , but the remarkable of carbon technology that you see changes everything .
You look at a look . This is the technology of the cleaning carbon technology .
Al Gore : Finally , the positive alternative , and the positive is the national security .
Video : Comment : America is in crisis ; the economy , the national security , the national security crisis .
The file that all the connects all : our depenpending on fossil fuel , like the sports of fossil and oil imported .
Now , though , there 's a new audace , a new audace solution to use .
Repower : 100 percent of clean energy , in 10 years .
A plan to reput America to work , make more surance , and make it more secustststanding .
Finally , a solution that is to solve our problems .
Repower . Scoprite more .
Al Gore : This is the last .
Video : It 's about re-powered .
One of the fastest ways to bring the dependence from the combustible that will kill our planet .
So , the future is here . I 'm here . I mean , a new energy network .
Novi : Novi investment for two : New investment for jobs .
Comment : Repower America . It 's time to be realists .
Al Gore : A old African an old African says , " If you want to go fast , go to fast , go to yourself .
If you want to go away , you go together . "
We have to go away , quickly .
Thank you very much .
Last year at TED , I introduced a LHC .
And promise to get back to you about how the machine works .
So here I was not the LHC is the biggest scientific experiment ever there , the LHC is the biggest scientific experiment ever ever tempted -- 27 miles of circles .
His compassionate to restriate the conditions that were at less than a billion pair of the universe -- until 600 million times a second .
All of that is just ambiitious .
This is the Groy-evra .
We 're going to pay these these min-Big Bang in the remarkers .
This is what I work . It 's called ATLAS -- is about 44 feet and has a 221,000 feet .
This is a spectacular picture of ATLAS in built this , so you can see proportions .
Ten september last year , we got the car for the first time .
And this picture was taken by ATLAS .
It was because of immense festegation in the control room .
It 's a picture of the first particles that had done all the time of the LHC , and in collision , in collision , with a part of LHC , and spread particles into the relevator .
In other words , when we see that image 10 writing , we found the car that 's a big writing .
I don 't know if it was this to do us more or that , when you go to Google and saw that the initial page was this .
That means we have had a cultural impact over to the scientific impact .
About a week later , there was a problem with the car , just had to these flaps here -- these files here .
These flecting 13,000 legs when the car works at the massive of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the massive .
Now , the technical technical technical , and they will say , " It 's not true . I 'm very sotical . "
And they can do it because when they 're very cold they become the superconflict truly .
So , at least 271 degrees , at least 271 degrees , at the space between the stars , these blow , they can bring that current .
In one of the junture of the most novemile magneti in the LHC , there was a defect of fit .
So the files , and the 13,000 points , and 13,000 prining suddenly met a electrical resistance .
This was the result .
Now , this is even more impressive if you think these magneti fish more than 20 tons , and that have been moved about 30 centimeters .
They 're damaged about 50 magneti .
We had to take them , what we did .
We restinated them and upon it .
They 're now going back to the underground .
By the end of the march is the LHC will be back .
We 're going to access it , and we expect to get the data , and we 're going to go so our adventure , and we continue so our adventure to find what are the universe .
Now , of course , in a certain way , these these accidents return the debate on the value of science and engineering in front of the engineering of the conviction . It 's easy to conviction .
I think the fact that it 's so hard , the fact that I think it 's the value of things like LHC .
I want to conclude with the words of a English scientist , Humphrey Davy , which , I guess , I think , in defense of the experiments of his puppile , his puple was Michael Faraday , said , " Nient is very dangerous to the human mind that the rups of the human mind that the ratings of science are definition , that our triures of the human mind that our triumphs are not unrely .
Thank you .
I want to start asking you about when , children , you play with the children , play with the morning in the morning .
While you can understand how to get them to get them and make them , and get them , you know , and you 're going to move them , and you 're going to be able to think and solve problems .
The space reasoning is deeply connected to the way we understand a lot of the world around us .
So , from information usulity of our interaction with physical objects , and I started to ask with my physical consultant , and my collaborator Jeevan Kalanithi , I started to ask myself , " And if we use a computer , instead of having the only of the mouse as a digital pollutch that it 's going to be a little bit of the digital , we could deal with a desktop , and we could deal with a little bunch of information with the bunch on a desktop ,
and how do it to do it ?
The question was so interesting that we decided to explore the answer , building Siftable .
In a few words , a Siftable , a big computer as a biscoothing .
In a few words , a Siftable , a big computer as a biscoothing .
You can move with the hand , can " see " between them , " and they can see their movement and have a screen and a wireless screen .
But especially , are physical objects , like the morning , you can just move them to be affect them .
The Siftable is the example of a new ecosystem tools to manipulate digital information .
And as they become more physicians , conscious of the movement , of the other , and as they become more physical , conscious of the movement , of how we move them , we can explore new and fun and fun and fun and fun of interaction .
I 'm going to start with some simple example .
This Siftable is configured to show video : if you put it in a direction , the video , the video will stand on the other side .
These interactive rat are conscious about the other .
If you have affiances , they 're interested in what they 're around .
If they 're surrounded , and they can act a little bit .
If they 're surrounded , and they can act a little bit .
They also green their movement and inclination .
We then realized that one of the interaction was that one of the interaction was that we can use common data , for example , " we path a color if it was a liquid .
In this case , we have three Siftable as a buck of green and use them to use the color in the middle of the color in the middle , where you 're mischieve .
and I can use them to be able to fix the color in that , where they 're mischieve .
We 're going to be too , we can put a little bit in a place .
There are also beautiful possibility of learning , like language , and the mathematics , and the mathematics and games where people can try to do things very quickly , and see the results immediately .
I 'm now --
This is a Fibonaching that I do with a program of equations .
Here we have a words that 's a half of the words that 's half of Scarabeo and Boble .
And so , every turnal , you have a letter in case on every Siftable , Pratically , at every Sifable to a letter in case on every Sifable to a letter in case .
Then , after about 30 seconds you get remischieve , and you have a new reading set of reading and new possibility to try .
Thank you .
Here 's the children came to the Media Lab , I did this , I did this , and I did a video .
They are very pleased .
And one of the interesting things of this kind of appliance is that you don 't have to give people a lot of education .
You just say , " Compons of words , and they know exactly what to do .
Here 's the other people who try it .
This is our youngsters , there on the right .
It 's actually just wanted to stop them .
They were just morning in the morning , for him .
Now , this is a application of a interactive cartoon .
We wanted to build a tool for the learning of language Lui is Felix .
It can put new characters in the scene , by by just just by the Siftable them associated .
It can put new characters in the scene , by by just just by the Siftable them associated .
So , it 's going to get out .
Video : The sun is smile .
David Merrill : Now , she took a treat the scene .
Video : The trewer arange .
Bel work ! Yeah !
So , you know , Siftable and put them close to interact with characters --
Video : Bau !
-- inventing your own story .
Video : Hi !
DM : It 's a story with the open , and it can decide him how you do .
DM : It 's a story with the open , and it can decide him how you do .
Video : From .
DM : The last example I have time to show you is a tool , which is a tool , recently made of a tool , to do it .
It 's a tool , made of recent , to the sample and to executive music .
The Siftable here , the Siftable here , the bacteria .
Everyone of these has four different variations , and you can choose that use .
You can also put these sound in a sequence to a sequence to compories .
And just to move it by by making a sound and a sequence .
These are actually actually able that you can control from the vivivivivivivivivivivivivivivivivivivivivivivivivivivivivivivivivivivious ,
The attacks to a particular sound and then till till the clues .
And then there are the general effects as time and volume , which is applied to the entire sequence .
Let 's look at how it works .
Video : We 're going to start with a bunch in two Siftable , we 're going to be in a series , we 're add in a series , we add other basic .
Now I put a bass line .
Video : I add the sense of the --
Video : And I 'll put the filter at the bacteria , so I can control the effect from the alive .
Video : I can be able to be able to queze the whole sequence time by one or the other .
Video : And I 'm going to add the bottom of the bottom to give more expression .
Video : I can recombine the sequence of the flying .
So I didn 't have to plan it before , but I can improvise , and make it longer or cort .
And now , finally , I can spend the whole sequence of the Siftable , " volume . "
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is to build new mo-to-better , how much more more sounds like our brain and body .
And today , I 've had time to show you one of the results of this path , and also some chance we try to bring out of the lab .
The concept I want to get to you is that 's coming this new generation of designed to interact with digital media , to interact with digital media , which will take information in the way we want .
Thank you very much .
I don 't see the time to talk to you with all of you .
I 'm a writer .
I 'm going to be books is my profession , but it 's more than that , of course .
It 's also love and the fascination of my life .
And I don 't expect that it can change .
But , said , something particular happened to my life and my career , which has taken me to recently me to recently me the whole relationship with this job .
The particular particular thing is that I 've been wrote this book , this biography called " Mangia , " Ama , " which , diversly from my previous books , for some reason why in the world and became a big , bestseller , interational , and the interational feelational , and interational ,
And the result is that everywhere , people treat me as if I were convicted .
It 's true -- you 're convicted .
They 're going to be worry and they say , " You don 't afraid to do you don 't do you feel that much better ?
You don 't fear to continue to write for all life without being able to create a book that can important to be able to create a book that can importance to somebody ? "
that can be importance to somebody ? "
It 's certainly , you know .
But it could go worse , on the one I remember that over 20 years ago , when I started to say , I was a writing -- I wanted to be a writer .
I 'd meet in the same reaction , I 'm going to be a fear .
And people said , " I don 't have successful ? "
Do you feel that the umilliation of the refute killed you ?
You don 't fear to do this for life without anything about it , and that 's never going out and to die on a cumulation of the infrants of dreams with the bits of the blood cenergies ? "
So , you know .
The answer to all of these questions is , " Yes . "
Yeah , I 'm afraid of all those things .
I 've always had fear .
And I also fear some other things that people can 't guess .
As the algae and other frightening things .
But , as I writing what I thought and I would ask a very much more , because ?
Is it rational ?
It 's logical that anyone should be pushed by a job that you 've been born to do .
But what 's so particular in the impressive and creative , and it 's really about the mental health of the mental health , in a way that other career don 't do ?
How father , for example , he was a chemist engineer and I don 't remember one time in the 40 years of activity that was asked if he was doing fear to be able to be able to engineer ?
There was never -- that blown of the John engineer John , what 's going ?
It doesn 't work that , you know ?
Onestly , chemicals as group have not certainly , in the centuries , waraded the reputation of being alcolied to be alcolied .
We have a writers , we have enough to do this reputation , and not just writers , but creative of all kinds of things , we have this reputation to be huge .
And it 's not something else that look at the triad of the deaths of creative magnificments that , only in the 21st century , they died young and often for them .
And even the ones that don 't suicide sound like they 're dunned by their dungs .
Norman Mailer , before I died , in the last interview said , " Every , I 've been killed a little more more , an extraordinary affermation about the work of your life .
But we don 't kill that we hear this because we 've heard these things so long that in a way , we 've completely interiorized and accepted the notion that creativity and suffering are in some way , and that art , at the end , it will always always always at the analysy .
And the question I want to take to everybody today is : are you agree with this idea ?
It 's good to you this -- because it 's also looking at it from a hundred of distance to me , it 's not good for this support .
I think it 's hate .
And I think it 's dangerous and I don 't want to see the perpetuate in the next century .
I think it 's better to encourage our big creative minds .
And I certainly know that , in my case -- in my situation -- it would be very dangerous to start fuse to that I was very date to be the circumstances in my career .
It 's very , unsum look , it 's pretty young , I 've been about 40 years .
I 've still about four decades of work in me .
And it 's very likely that anything I writing in the world , and it 's going to be judged by the world , as the work that I 'm going to be able to do .
I 'm going to be slavery because we 're all more friends here -- is likely that my biggest successful to my behind .
Oh , Gesus , who thought !
You know this is the kind of thought that leads a person to start to drink a little bit of the nine and I don 't want to do it .
I would keep doing this work that we 're going to go and do this work that we 're going to go .
So , the question becomes , what ?
And so I think , after a lot of reflectial reflections , that the way to continue to write is to create a psychological psychological construction , OK ?
I have to find a way to find a safety distance between me , which I 'm writing , and my natural anxial , which is going to be able to get . And , as I was trying to do it , and I was trying to see if they could have better and more healthy ideas to see if they could have better and more healthy ideas could have more and more healthy and more healthy healthy ideas if they could have better and see if they could have better ideas have better ideas , and I 'm writing
about how to help people creative to manage the inerent risk of creativity .
And that research brought me to the old Grek and old Rome .
I 'm going to go through the circle and then it 's back .
In the ancient Grek and old Rome -- people don 't seem to believe that creativity came from men , OK ?
It was thinking about creativity was this revolution to be and that came out of a few distant and unknown , for a few distant source and unknown , for reasons and unknown , for reasons .
The Greeks called these spirites of the creativity of creativity , " demon . "
Socrate , wonder , he believed to have a demon that wisdom wisdom from far away .
The Rohands were the same idea , but called the the species of spirit .
which is great , because the Roands didn 't really think a genius was somebody who was particularly intelligent .
They thought that a genius was this kind of divine that had literally been living in the walls of an artist study of a artist , a little bit like the elpho Dobby , and who came out to see the work of the artist and the job of the artist and models the outcome of that work .
Here 's emotional -- this is the distance of which I talk about -- that psychological construction that you protected the results of your job .
And everybody knew it was so that it was what it worked , right ?
So the anti-artists were protected by certain things , like , the way , so for example , too much narrow , no ?
If your job was exceptional , you couldn 't take all the place , you know that you were helped by this genium incorporate .
If your job failures , it wasn 't your whole , right ?
Everybody knew it was your genius to be a inable .
And so people are han conceived creativity in Occient for a long time .
Then the Renciment came and everything changed , and it 's all this big idea ; we put the human being over the universe over and the mysteries and no more leaving space of the universe , and without leaving space and no longer and no more leaving space .
This was the principle of humanity and people started thinking about creativity came out of the indeed of the rational isse .
And for the first time in the history , you start to refly this or the artist as a genius , to a genius , in a genius .
And I have to tell you , I think it was a big mistake .
I think I allow somebody , a simple person to believe that being a recipient as a source , the essence and the source of all the mysteries , creativity and unknowable and and inknowable and a very large physical , you know , and unknowable and an unknowable to make the human psycholic .
It 's like to ask someone to ingoiate the sun .
Deform and demand , and we all make all these inexecutives on performance .
And I think it 's been this pressure that I 've been destroyed to the artists in the 500 years .
And , if this is true , and I think it 's the question becomes , and now ?
Can we do that ?
Maybe be I 'll go back to a more comprehension of human relationship between humans and creative mystery creative .
Or maybe not .
Maybe we can 't just take 500 years of rational thinking in a 18 minutes .
And there 's probably people in the audience that would have been reading the scientific news on the notion of the scientific , fit that follows the next people are the next people in their projects .
I 'm not going to convince you all about this thing .
But the question I 'd like to ask is -- why isn 't it ?
Why don 't you think about this this way ?
Because it 's more sense of anything else that I 've ever heard about to explain the exababsolutely impremobility .
A process that , as anyone who ever tried to do something -- so , it 's basically all here -- you know , you 're not comporing rational .
And , in fact , it can sometimes look completely like a paranoral .
I did this meeting with the extraordinary Ruth Stone , who has now 90 years , but he was a poeter for all of life and said , in his infancy in the rural Virginia , working out in the camps , and he felt it , in if a poem came from , when a poem was in if a poem came from the landscape .
He said it was like a fragorous train of the air .
And he was rotating to her from the landscape .
He was going to be able to get the earth under his feet .
He knew I had one thing to do to do at that point and was of the words , " curring as a matt . "
And so it 's going to go home and come up from this poetry , and he wouldn 't have to get a piece of card and a matite enough , and a matit 's a little bit fast and a page .
Over times he couldn 't be fast enough , so corrective and correcves and correcves without able to get to home and the roolar the fix and the roolar the polar , and she kept through the landscape , looking , as she said , " another poet . "
Then there were those times -- this piece of the time I 'm never going to become -- there were almost losing , right ?
So , he was running home and he was trying to look at the card and the poem was going through , and he was a match in the way , and then he said , which was like if you fall with the other hand and the steffed .
He caught the poem from the tail and remaining it in his body and transformed it on the page .
And in these cases , the poem would be able to the perfect page and intact , but by the last word at the first .
So when I felt that I thought -- it 's very except , it 's exactly the same same thing of my creative process .
Not all my creative process -- I 'm not a conviction .
I 'm a mule , and my way to work is ; I 'm wake up , every day and play and go through the goffly and work and go down and get it on the goffly .
But even I 've got to my headline , I 've striped that thing , sometimes .
And I guess that many of you have the han .
You know , even if the work and ideas came up with a certain source , you can 't waste it .
And what is this ?
And how can we relate it in a way that we can 't lose your head , but rather , what do you get to be healthy ?
As I 'm about , the best contemporary example I have is the musician that I have a musician , which I 've been different several years ago for a newspaper .
We were talking about this , and you know , Tom , for the majority of life is the incarnation of the incarnation of the incarnation , trying to control , and to dominate , to dominate these species of impults .
But then he started to invectured , and one day , and one day while he was driving on a highway to Los Angeles , changed all for him .
It was going to be fast and all of a tract , this little feeling of the melody , which comes in the head as the inspiration , and the desidst , but you want , you know , it 's wonderful , and the desider , but you don 't know how to take it .
It 's not a piece of paper , it doesn 't have a matt , it 's not a math .
So it starts to hear this species of old , and he sort of , " I 'm going to lose , and I 'm going to remain obsessed sessionated song .
I 'm not good enough and I can 't do it . "
And instead of going to go to the panic , and he stopped .
And he got the whole process of mental and made something completely new .
He just just just the sky and said , " Scuses , I don 't see that I 'm driving ? "
" You know , it seems to write a song now ? "
If you really want to be there , you get a more opporter , when I can take care of you .
Every , you go to importantly somebody else today .
I went to disturbing Leonard Cohen . "
And his process of working on this .
Not the job , the job was still dark .
But the process , and the anxiety of the anxiety was remained when the genius , the genius that he was going to go back back to where , and he was able to get it back from where , realizing that he didn 't have to be a hyorized thing and remaintain .
but you can yes this peculiar , wonderful bizarre collaboration between Tom and this strange and outside that although it was not Tom .
So , the way I felt that story to change a little bit even the way I worked and already , I was already saved .
This idea , I was saved when I was writing , " Prega , " and fall in one of those cave disperation where we 're going to work on and we 're not doing something and we 're not able to do and we can 't start to do and you start thinking that will be a disaster , which is going to be the worst book I 've been writing .
Not just bad , just the worst book written .
And I started thinking about this project .
But I remembered to me about Tom who I talked to the air and I tried .
So I went up to my face up in the dark and I was just blind my face to a vacuum of the room .
And I said , " Look , what , you know , both , what , if this book is not going to be very brilliant , no ?
Because I 'm going to see that I 'm going to do with all I have , I don 't have that .
So if you want to be better , you have to present you and do your part .
OK . But if you don 't do it , you know what , I don 't do that .
I 'm going to write the same because it 's my job .
And I 'd like to do my part , " I 've been presented to do my part , " Why -- at the end is so , OK -- -- centuries ago in the North Africa , people were unran for the dances of the moon of the moon of the moon of the mountain , and to the dawn .
And they were always magnificent , because the dances were professionals and were fantastic .
But every while , rarely , something happened , and one of these artists became transformed .
And I know you know what I 'm talking about , because I know you all of you , a performance , a performance so .
It was like the time , and the dancer , and the dancer walked through a kind of landscape and she was not doing anything else from the only 1,000 notes before , but all of them .
And suddenly , not appearing like a human .
But it 's accese from the diinside and it 's illuminated in the fuoco of the divinity .
And when this happened , the time , the people knew what was called him .
They had their hands and start singing , and they started to cantare , " Allah , God , " God , "
That 's God , you know .
Curious note -- when the Mororic Mororal invaded , this habitude with them and the forced changed in the centuries from " Allah , " to " Ole , " Ole , " , " which you can still feel in the corries or or the flamp .
In Spain , when a artist did something impossible and magic , " Allah , , " Allah , " Allah , " By , " incomprererequently , " Take , " -- a last of God .
And it 's great because we need .
But , the problem comes the day after , for the dances , when you wake up and discover that are 11 in the morning of Martedesh and finished God 's not more .
It 's just a mortal with a mortal with a gran bad , and maybe it will never get more to get that altitude .
And maybe nobody will you have the name of God 's going to come up , and what does it have to do with the rest of his life ?
It 's hard .
This is one of the most painful recognized to make a creative life .
But maybe it doesn 't have to be so much if you can 't believe , if you can 't believe , in the most extraordinary aspects of your being being being being from yourselves .
But you might just believe that you 're being data in prested by a inimaginable source of this team of the life that 's life that you have to go to somebody else when you finished .
And , you know , if we think it in this way , it 's all changes .
And so I started thinking about it , and it 's certainly how I thought about a different time in the work of the book that I 'm going to give it , the dangerous , and it 's very success ,
And what I 've been going to continue to tell me when I feel electried by this is , I 'm not afraid .
It 's not just your job . It 's just your job .
It 's a present-the-presented to your side , any can be .
If your job is dancing , you 're dancing .
If the divine , absurd on you assigned decide to let me just let some kind of wonderful , for one moment through the effort , then " Ole . "
Every , you do the same your dance .
And " Ole ! " at yes .
I think , I think , I should be taught .
" Ole ! " at yes , even for the same human and headline that are willing to make you continuously .
Thank you .
Thank you .
June Cohen : Ole !
As you know I 've talked about some of these projects on the human genome , what can meet and the discovery of new genome set .
Now we 're starting a new path . We started to digitize biology and now starting from that digital code we 're going to get into a new new biology of biology , designing and synthesize and synthesize and winting life .
We always tried to ask great questions .
" What is life ? " is something that many biologists have tried to understand the windmill .
We tried different approaches , reduced it to the minimity .
We 're digitizing for almost 20 years .
When we sequenced the human genome was to spend from the analogical world of the biology of the computer .
Now we ask us : can regenerate life , or create new life from this digital universe ?
This is the map of a little organism , Mycoplasma genitalium , which is the smallest genome , which is the smallest genome between those who can autorate in the lab .
And we tried to reduce more than the genome to create a smaller .
We can get a hundred gene of a hundred gene of about 500 that are here .
But when we look at the maps of the metabolic map , it 's relatively simple than our .
So , I believe me , this is simple .
But when we look at all the genes that we can get , one at the time , it 's very unlikely that this can bring to a living cells .
So we decided that the only way to progree was synthesize this chromosome so that we could modify the components to bring some of these fundamental questions .
And so we started the adventure of " can be synthesizing a chromosome ? "
Can you have chemistry to make these big molecules that we never have been able to create these big molecules that we never have been able to create these big molecules that we never did ?
And , in case , can we make a chromosome ?
A chromosome is just a piece of chemical material .
The speed that we 're able to digitize life is growing up to refer .
Our ability to write the genetic code , instead of proposition , but it 's getting very slowly .
And our most recent results to a exponential curve .
We started over 15 years ago .
The process required a lot of passes , starting with a bioethical requires that we started the first experiments .
But we found out that synthesize DNA is very difficult .
There are tens of thousands of machines that produce small segments of DNA , long , long , the long time of 30 to 150 letters and it 's a degenerative process : the more than the segment is longer , there are .
So we had to develop a new method to assembly these framments and correcrect the errors .
And this was our first attempt , starting from the digital information of Phi X 174 .
It 's a little virus that kills bacteria .
We designed the fragments , effectuated the correction of the errors and get a DNA molecule of about 5,000 letters .
The interesting part of this is when we got this piece of chemistry inert material and we put it in bacteria , the bacteria have started to read this genetic and viral particles .
The viral particles have been released by the cells , they 're back and went back and destroyed the Ecles .
I talked about the recent with the oil industry by saying they 're certainly compressed to them that they 're certainly compressed this model .
They have remains more than you .
We believe that this is a situation where the software can really build the same hardware in a biological system .
But we wanted to do things bigger .
We wanted to build the whole chromosome of the bacteria .
They 're about 580 miles of genetic code .
So we thought of building it in the cassets of the virus , so that we can change the cassets to understand what are are of a living cells .
The design is crucial , and if we start with digital information in a computer , these have to be very accurate .
When we sequenced this genome for the first time in 1995 accuractivity was a mistake for every 10 miles .
We found it , we found it , 30 error . If we had that original sequence we wouldn 't be able to do it work .
One part of the process is designing 50 letters that are going to be required with all the other 50 letters to build subunity smaller than working together .
We 're trying to unique elements here .
You probably have to read that we put in the fix of the river .
So , think about this , we have a genetic code on four letters : A , C , G and T.
Three of those letters are meeting with about 20 friendly lominoacids , and there 's a specific order of reading for every lominominods .
So we can use the genetic code to write words , fracts , thoughts .
What we did at the beginning was autograpped .
Some have been deluss from the fact that it wasn 't poey .
We designed these segments to just unit with enzymes .
There are some enzymes that repair them and put them on them .
And we started assembling with segments , starting with segments from five to seven mile , unending them in a way that forming segments of 24 thousands of lectar-units at 72 mile .
Everybody has produced these segments in the abundance , so that we can sequence them from that we 're trying to create an extremely robustoking -- as you see in a minute .
We 're trying to automatize the process .
So , this seems the tabellon a basket player .
When we get these very long , much more than 100 miles , the low-to-bottom , they will not grow more directly in E.
It 's to the limit of modern tools of molecular biology .
So we 've been considered other mechanisms .
We knew about another mechanism called recombination omologa , which in biology is to repair the DNA to join the DNA to unit .
Here 's an example .
This organism , called Deinococcus radiodurans , can absorry three million radiation .
You can see in the upper square , as his chromosome as his chromosome .
In 12 -- 24 hours , it 's required as it was before .
They 're able to be able to do it .
These organisms can sit .
They can be in a vacuum .
They 're absolutely sure life exist in space , and you feel to find new water of water .
Actually , NASA showed this that this is .
This is a picture of the molecule that we built using these processes , just using the yeast with the design of the segments to put on .
The yeast assemble .
This picture wasn 't taken with a melting microscope , but with a microscope of electronic microscope .
It 's a molecule that we can see with a microscope .
These are photo that are a time of about six seconds .
This is the publishing that we did a little time ago .
They 're over 580,000 letters of genetic code .
It 's the biggest molecule of a defined structure that man .
It 's got a 300 million molecular weight .
If you stampassime with a 10 of cartoon cartoer , it would take 142 pages to just to get this genetic code .
Now , how do we do it work ? How can we do it ?
Obviously , through a virus is a game from kids .
It 's a little bit more complicated when you use bacteria .
It 's simper , even when it 's about the euuly , you can just extract the nucleus and and put one of it , and put one one of the process .
In the bacteria , the chromosome is instead of integrated it , but we recently demonstrated that we 're able to do a complete transplant that we can do a complete cell to another and to attract it .
We clear a chromosome from a cross-up , we can make a little bit .
The two are different as the men from the mouse .
We added a few gene more so that we can decide what to do for this chromosome .
And then , he skip with the enzymes , so that you can kill all the proteins .
And when we put it in the cells was stupendoubled -- and you will appreciate our sophisticatoo-- the new chromosome cell .
And we started thinking we couldn 't go beyond , but we tried to get more in there .
This is one of the major mechanisms of evolution .
We found that a lot of species have added species to a second or a chromosome , and I add in a second thousand tracs in a second thousand tracks to that species .
So who thinks about evolution as a gene that has not only been to get a lot of of the biology .
They 're in the enzymes called restrial restrition enzymes that I will make a DNA .
The chromosome that was in the cells , it doesn 't have one .
The cell phone , the chromosome that we have put it down .
It 's been expressed , and recognized the other expressed as the expressed material , and we found it with only the cell , and we found it with only the cell and the new chromosoma .
It became blue because of the genes we put .
And in a short time , all the characteristics of a species , went through the feature , and it turned out in a new species , based on the new software that we put in in the cells .
All the proteins have changed , the membrane have changed , and when we read the genetic code is exactly to what we 've transfted .
Now , this may look like genetic alchemy , but altering the software , we can change the things very , very , very , very , very , very , very , but altering the software .
Now , I 've already explained that this is not about genesis -- but to progress from three million years and a half million years of evolution , and I said that maybe we 're going to create a new version of Cambrian explosion that will be created new species on this digital process .
Why do that ?
I think it 's pretty obvious when we think about our needs .
We 're going to go from six and a half billion people in the next 40 years .
Right for an example : I was born in 1946 .
Now there are three people on the planet for each of a 1946 .
We 're having problems now to find food , fresh water and clean , medical water and the benzen and a half billion people .
It 's going to be even more about it for nine billion .
We use more than five billion carbon , more than 30 billion carbon , more than 30 billion barians .
That means a hundred million barions a day .
When we try to find biological processes , or any kind of process to replace them , it will be a huge challenging .
We have to keep the whole emission of the CO2 emission from these materials that 's going into the atmosphere .
At the day , because of the scientific discoveries all over the world , we have a database with about 20 million genes , and I like to think they are the design components for the future .
The electronics has only only a dozen about a dozen of components , and think about how many different things are coming out .
Our limitations are just just just a cross-up data and our imagination .
Now we have a techniques , because of these rapid synthetization , able to create what we call combinatory genomics .
We can build a big robot that can make a big robot that can produce a million chromosomes a day .
Think of processing these 20 million genes are different genes of trying to optimize the processes to produce eight-or drugs , new vaccines , we can change , because of a little team , and to create more biology now that in the last 20 years of science .
And it 's just a standard selection .
We can choose for the possibility of survival , chemical production or fuel production , or fuel production .
This is a moment of some software programs that we 're working on to be able to be able to sit and design species to make us design to make us design species .
Well , we don 't necessarily know how it will be .
We know exactly what their genetic code .
We 're now focusing on the fourth of the fourth generation .
You 've seen you that extract in ethanol was a bad experiment .
We have a second and the third generation generation that are going to use enough from the sugar to the higher than the eight-higher , like the eight-different types of butanol .
But the only way biology can have a big impact without increasing the cost of food and limitarne the cost of food and limitarne the cost of the world and limitarne , so we 're working to design cells that we can get to get to the cell , and we think we have the first fuel of quarters generation in about 18 months .
The solar light with CO2 is a metodog -- but in our discoveries all over the world , we have found different metods .
This is a organism that we described in 1996 .
It lives in the deep ocean , about 2500 feet of the depth of water , at the temperature of water .
They create a metane from CO2 , using hydrogen molecular as a source of energy .
We 're trying to understand if we can incanalate CO2 , which can easily be transported through tubes , converting that CO2 in the carburant , to drive this process .
So , we think that we can be able to be able to increase what the basic question , " What 's life " is " We , green , real , we have the goal to replace the whole oil industry .
Exactly . If you can 't do that from TED , where you can ?
It would be a main for energy .
And we 're also working for using the same metods to create the same metods to create vaccines .
You 've seen this year with flu , we 're always back to a year and with a dollar , when it 's to find the right vaccine .
I think what you can change by building vaccines in the tiny vaccines in antiicipate vaccines .
Here 's how the future could start to look like changing , the tree of evolution , and accelerating evolution with synthetic bacterial , and inally inally cells .
We 're so far from improving people .
Our purpose is to make it a way to live enough to try to do it . Thank you very much .
First of all , I 'm going to show you , the fastest possible , some fundamental work , the new technology that we brought to a buy one year ago . This is Seadragon .
It 's a environment that you can interact to be in the local level that you can interact with a huge amount of visual data .
So , we 're seeing very very much gigabyte photos of digital phoom and continuous , for a panoramic fast , and and for a lot of images as we want .
And it doesn 't matter how much much much much of the information that we see , how big these are these data , or the images .
Most are common photographs , but this for example is a scanning from the Library of Congress of Congress and recome from the Library of 300 megapixel .
It doesn 't make any difference because the only thing that limits the prestation of a system like this is the number of pixel on your screen in your screen in any time . It 's also a very flexel .
This is a book , for example of data not images .
This is the Casa desolate of Dickens . Every colony represents a chapter .
So to show you that it 's just about it and not images , we can do something like that , to see that it 's a real representation of the text , not a picture .
It could be a little bit a way of a electronic book to read an electronic book .
Not the advice .
This is a more realistic example . It 's a number of The Guardian .
Every image is the beginning of a section .
And it really gives you the pleasure and the beautiful experience of reading the real cartaceful version of a magazine , or a date , which is for nature of a lot .
We also did something with the corner of this particular number of the The Guardian .
We 've created a higher puzzle solutioneshelter of what you use in a normal advertising , and we put extra content of the content .
If you want to see the characteristics of this automobile , you can see here .
Or other models , or even the specific technical .
And this really shows some of these ideas to eliminating the limits of space on the screen .
We hope that means to put up to the pop-up and other porcheries , and other similar , not to be necessary .
Of course , the map is one of the most obvious applications for this kind of technology .
And I don 't want to lose time , if we don 't say we have contribute to give them in this field .
These are all the streets in the U.S. , subverage over a NASA geospace .
So , we 're going to go to something else .
This is now now , it 's actually from the Web ; you can go to see .
It 's a project called Photosynth , which combine two different different technologies .
A is Seadragon and the other is a very interesting computer research that 's a very interesting computer that by Noah Snavely , a student of Steve Snavely , with the help of Steve Seitz of UW Szeliski , Rick Szi , Microsoft Rick .
And it 's from the world-handscape , and the managon .
You can see this when we do this kind of screen , where we can go from one image to another and have this kind of experience to the last ball . And then , you can see this kind of a multiple solution .
But the space collocation of the images here has actually a meaning .
The algorithms of the computer visualization have been recorded these images , so that they have been taken together , so that you can imagine -- all the near of the Canadians , and all the near of the Rockies -- they 're shown up . And here you see the elements of a de-show , and these things are all lined at the space .
I don 't know if I have time to show you some other environment .
There are a few more space .
I want to go directly to one of the original data of Noah-- and this comes from a previous privious prototype of Photosynth that we did the first time last summer , I 'll just show you what I think is really the key to the early this technology , Photosynthy Photosynthy . And it 's not necessarily clear to look at the environments we put in the website .
We had to worry about legal aspects and so on .
This is a re-built of Notre Dame images in the Flickr , and you get a picture of Flickr and you get images of typal , and you get images of types , other of the campus and so on . And so , you can see these orants a picture that it 's discovered to this model .
So , they 're all images by Flickr and all of space in this way .
And it 's possible to navigate this very very very very simpsional way .
You know , I never thought I would end up to work for Microsoft .
It 's very gratificent to get this kind of acail here .
I think you can see that it 's a lot of different kinds of fotoxes , of the cell phones to those of the mobile phone SLR , a meaning number of meaning , put together in this environment .
And if I can , I try to look at those strange .
A lot of them are block , etc .
It 's somewhere here is a series of photographs -- which is cole .
This is a Nototre of Notre Dame recorded correctly .
We can go from the poster to the physics of this environment .
The essential point is that we can do things with social environment . This is now taking data from the whole memory of the collective memory of how to appear to be , from the whole point of view -- and connected to all of those data together .
All those pictures become connected together , the more of the parts .
You have a model of the earth that emerging .
Think about this as a prolungation of Stephen Lawler 's work on Earth .
It 's something that grows in complexity as people use it , and the whose you 're going to use it .
Their pictures are husbed with inserites by other people .
If you get somebody to be the idea of contrassigning all these sants and say , the picture of Notre of Nototprint Dimprovised to be requires of all of those data , and I can use it as a point of the data , using the picture of a certain kind of a kind of a kind of a cross-mooth experience , and a cross-to-shelf experience , from anyone that 's a cross-mos-out of the way ,
Of course , a consequence of all of that are virtual models , so that 's very interesting , in the early , the collective and and satellitaries and satellitaries and similar images and similar images and similar images and similar images and similar images and satellitaries and similar imagination and satellitary imagination and satellitaries and all the interesting imagints of the earlifts of all of the interesting things .
Thank you very much .
Chris Anderson : I got understood ? What your software is going to take us to do is that at a certain point , in the next few years , all of photographs and shared in the whole world will be practically connected with ?
BAB : Yeah . What 's doing is doing in practical .
It 's creating hyperlink , if you want , you to be in images .
And it 's doing it in the content of images .
The thing becomes very interesting if you think about the rich richness of several of these images .
As you do a research research on the web , you have a phrase and the text on the web page has a lot of information about the images of the picture .
Now , what happens if that picture is that picture you all your pictures ?
So the amount of several interconnection and the amount of wealth that is really big . It 's a classic effect of the network .
CA : Blaise , it 's really unbelievable .
BAS : Thank you very much .
One of the major pleasure when you travels and one of the ethnographics of ethnographics is the way to live between who who has no antic traditions , between the wind , the wind , the wind the stones , the guess of the levert-wind lowing loving .
Baster thinking that the sciamans Jaguar travel again , and the Milky Via , or that the mya lot of meaning , or Himalaya , or Himalaya , the buddists are still in the damage of the anthropology of anthropology , and the idea that the world in which we live in which there is not exist and in sense , but it 's just a model of reality , but it 's just a model of reality ,
the consequence of a particular adaptive set of choices that our stones did , well , or a lot of generations ago .
And , of course , we all share of the essential tracts .
Everybody is hidden .
We 're subjects to start .
We have to death the inexorability of death , so we don 't surprise if we 're going to get and whom --
We all have a art .
What it 's the particular rhythm of the song , the rhythm of every culture .
It doesn 't matter that are the Penan forests of Borneo , or the follow of the Vodoo 's the Curururout of the Kenya sectenth in Kenya sectenth in Kenya sectental in the Sahara .
He was my journey of journey in the desert a month ago , or a aleyeak in the yak of the Kids , the world 's demand .
All of these populations teaching us that there are other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , other ways of moving into the world .
And , if you think , you think , it 's a concept that it can give you hope .
And together , we have a myrifying the world of the world , they create a spiritual life and cultural and cultural life that is important to well-being of the planet and is important to well-being of the planet as biosphere .
And you can think about this cultural rageless as a weless , and you can defining the thnosphere , and you can defining the whole conception of all concepts , dreams , and intuitions , intuitions , intuitions , intuitions , and intuitions , intuitions ,
The etnosphere is the fantastic patrimony .
It 's the symbol of what we are and what we can be as as a polluted species .
And because it was very , very , very , very , consumed , as it 's been very quickly consumed to the etnosphere and unfortunately much faster .
Nothing that is about the biologist , that the 50 percent of all species was or is on the orlo of extinction , just because it 's fly , or -- in the most apocaly-the--- in the field of biological diversity -- and you don 't even even even even even even even even even than the most optimistic -- that of cultural diversity .
The index of all of that is , of course , the language .
When you 're born 6,000 languages on this planet .
A language is not just a vocabulary or a series of a grammical rules .
A language is the human spirit of the human spirit .
It 's the half of the animal that 's the animal world .
Every language is a forest of the mind , a backin , a thought , a winner , a thought of spiritual possibility .
And of those 6,000 languages , while we 're sitting in Monterey , at least half the other half of them , and the other people are not sustain the ears of children .
They 're not teaching children , the people who are not not not trust something , which is not not trust something , which are already death .
What is the most sad than being you have been flies from the silence , of being the last speak , of the last speak , of the wisdom of the wisdom of the children ?
This is a pherous horing was in some part of the world every two weeks : every two weeks a old one weeks , a old one and door with himself in a language .
And I know somebody you will say , " Don 't it much ?
The world wouldn 't be a better place if you talk about all the same language ? "
We talk about kogue .
You 're going to be able to talk about the language .
I 'd like to give you a journey through the etnosphere --
a little journey in the etnosphere to give you a mess of what we 're losing .
Many of us forget that when I say , " different ways of exists , " intended different ways of exists .
We take for example this Barasana 's baby , in the settlement of the anacond anacond , which creates the myth to create the myth of provenge sacond ssacking .
It 's a popular popular that 's not able to distinguish the blue from the green because you were identified in the forest , which is depends on the popular .
They have a strange language and a matrimonial rule , called examia , " language , " you have to marry a different language .
And all of that radical , in the past mythologic , the particularity is that in these exhouseholds in which which are talking to six or seven languages because of marriages of marriages , and if you 're in the mystery one language .
They 're limited to listen to the back and then start talking .
We take one of the most interesting tribe with which I lived , the Waorans of Ecuador north , an incredible popular that has had the early contacts in 1958 .
In 1957 , five missionary they have tried a construct by a factor .
They did off the photographs that they found them in a picture that they found them in a place that they would come from that the population of pluvial forest had never seen bi-size .
They collected the photos from the earth , they have a research research or a shape and , and not finding the blow , and they kill the five missionaries with the two missionaries with the mobile .
But Waorans don 't just kill the foreign .
They were killed with them .
54 percent of the mortality was caused by themselves .
We went up to eight generations and we found two different death , and we found two natural death and when we stay out , they had a lot of them was aged that , and then killed him him him him , and then killed him him him .
The hunters were able to recognize the animal urine from 40 pass and recognize the species .
In the early ' 80s , I was assigned a very interesting task when my professor of Harvard , if I wanted to go to Harvard to the society of Duvalier and Tonton Machcolues and Tonton Macholutes and Tonton Macholutes and Tonton Macoutes and impossessor , and I would impossessor of the veill-and-a-.
For a sense of miraculous miraculous , I should have to understand the Vodoun culture , and the Vodoo is not magic .
It 's quite a lot of metaphorial , in the world .
Very interesting .
If I ask you to tell me the great religions of the world , what would you say ?
Cristianism , Islam , Buddismo , Ebraism , etc .
A continent is always left out , and by thinking that sub-Saharan Africa doesn 't have any religious . And they 're and yes and Vodoo and the Vodoo is not the other than the distilside of these religious concepts of slavery .
What makes the interesting voodoo is the intention of the life and death .
So , the alive they 're going to hide the spirits .
The spiriters can be invoced by the Great Acqua , they 're going to say at the dance of the dance of the dance of the dance of the dance of the daily actionary , which is the followed to become the god .
That 's why the voodooost , you white going to talk about God .
We give God , and we 're forth God . "
And from the moment you 're having a little bit of the spirit you , how bad can you ?
So you have these incredible events : follow acting voodoo in state of trance that touch impuntizing , which is impuntizing , rather straight of the power of the mind when it 's catalyzed in a state of extreme , exciting extreme .
And all the populations I 've lived the most extraordinary of the Sierra Nevada : Sierra Nevada : Santa Marta , in the Santa Marta , in the secent-the-.
Indescending of the tyranges that once once they were living on the caraibia , in the popular of the Colombia in the actor of the conquician , the popular of the caraibicy-heres that are on caraibiceical plants .
In a continent macchievement , this popular is never been conquisted by the Spanish .
But in the time , they 're governed by a clero , but their formation is very extraordinary .
The young people are taken out of the families , three or four years , and they live in a sun-block , and they 're sitting in a world that 's made of dark and handwidth the base of the glacier for 18 years .
Two nine years of the noine-year-old choices to reproduce the nine months of management that transmanagement in the user-and-a-half years in the Grande Mother .
For all this time , they 're acculturate to the values of their society , values that their prayers and only their prayers , and just their prayers to keep the cosmic balance -- or to say the ecological balance .
At the end of this incredible initiation , they 're suddenly brought out and for the first time in their life , at 18 years , see an aleat . And in that moment , when the sunlexiety of the first ball of the things that have learned in theory , all of that that they 've learned in theory . The prete a step back , all of that , and it 's going back and it 's saying , and it 's saying ,
" I mean ? You know , how I said .
It 's really amazing . Now it 's going to protect it . "
They call the biggest brothers and say that we , the minors , we are the destroying , and the destruction of the world .
This level of intuition is extremely important .
When we think about the Ingence and the environment of the Rousseau and the old story of the wild , which is a razer concept of the wild , and maybe we 're even closer to the Earth .
The Indigene popular .
There 's no space for these things in the malaric paludi or in the winner of the Tibet , but thank you very much of the Tibet and the rate , and they created a mystics of the Earth 's not on concept of human consciously .
What does it mean ?
It means that a little girl of Any who will grow up the mountain a mountain is a spirit of Apu who will drive a destiny different and will have a human being going to have a very different human being able to get a very different way with the mountain with the mountain , which is a mountain of the Montana who will grow up a mountain of rocks to be being .
which is the demady of a spirit or a mineral cutter is irrelevant .
What 's interesting is the metaphor that defines the relationship between the individual and the natural world .
I grew up in the British forest , credating that forest the forest of the British , and they were cut .
And that made me a human being different from my friends Kwauter who believe that the forest are the Hamories of Hukuk and the blind of the paradise and the bal spiriters that live to the extreme of the world , spirits that they 're living at the extreme of the world , the spiriters that they 're going to deal with the Hamatsa .
If you start to consider that these cultures can create different reality , you can start to understand some their sense of feeling , and we take this plant .
I 've been taken this from open to the ndoctor in the nordoctor .
Mayatheist , you 've heard of the ayahuasca , the most powerful psycotive substance of the sciamanic repertory .
What makes it fascinating the aybe of the ayahuasca is not the phility potential of the substance , but its elaboration . It 's composition from two elements .
On one hand , this liana reading a series of beta-carbolines , harm and harm , a lot of hallucinogenic and a lot .
Taking the only plants , you have a blustn blustance , but it 's a little bit of consciously , but it 's used to take a little bit of the coffee family , said Psychotridis .
This plant is a lot of powerful triptamine , very similar to the serotonin , dimethoxtryptamine-5 , methoxtamine .
If you ever see the Yanomami , you 're going to see the Yanomami , the place that they do from a different species , you 're also contained methoxtamine .
Tiring that pock on the nose is a little bit like to be brought from a sparked of bunch , and landing on a sea of electricity . [ It doesn 't create a distorsion of the reality .
I was often with my professor , Richard Evan Shultes , the man who has taken the brought the man who had been psychical , with his discovery in the 1930s .
I think , my way , you can 't classifying these tripptamines as the training because if you 're not standing in a hallucinated .
It 's possible to be able to be if you 're assume with other chemicals that we have to make the MAO .
Now , it 's the beautiful carbon : Is that they find in this liana are inhibitors of MAO , the same kind of necessary to potential tripal version of tripal to potential , in a flour of 80,000 species of plants , how do these popular , how these people are they doing to have two morogically not that , but if you combinate in this way , create a biochemical version that 's sus the upon the subm of the minute of the parts ?
We use the great euthy of the proof the proof the proof the proof it and error , and it can reveal .
But if we ask the Indians , they 'll tell us , " The plants are talking about it . "
What does it mean ?
This tribes , the Cofan , has 17 variety of ayahuasking , which distinguess nets , and that at our eyes would be remains in in the forest .
If you ask them how they 're going to stbilify their tassonomy will tell us , " I thought , " I said , " No . "
The solution is : take the 17 variety of a full of the moon and each one will downtown and each will cannot with a mess .
With , you know , you 're not graduate to Harvard , but it 's much more interesting than content to the stami .
Now , [ applausi is that the problem is that even the people who have to have to heart popular , and in some way , but somehow reducts , but somehow reducts in the real world , and pass over .
In fact , 300 years , it 's not going to be remembered to his guerre or technologic innovations , but rather as the one was in which we 're stopped and have actively , or accepted by the immediately or accepted the destruction of the planet and cultural mass of biological and cultural issue of the planet .
All cultures through the centuries have been involved in a new dance possibility of life .
And the problem is not technology .
The Sioux Indians are not being Sioux when they put out of the arc and fit as as the Americans have no Americans in being in the horse and calute .
It 's not the change or the technology that threatening the integrity of the etnosphere . It 's the power .
The domination of the domination .
And if you give a look at the world , you find that these are not destinated cultures that these are not to be disappearing .
They 're living and dynamics and dynamics out from forces from existence to forces that go beyond their ability to adaptation .
I know that you 're disboscing in the Penan --
a popular nomuth of Sarawak , in the Swest , a popular popular , and a popular , and now reduced to a generation ago , and now reduced to the reduced and prostitution on the reversus , where you can see the river , it 's river to be a half of the Mar Cinese Mar Cinese , where you were born Meridional Meric , where you were able to be able to be the horizonte , and the horizon the horizon the horizonte , and the horizon to the horizonate , and you , and the horizonte , and a a , and the horizon the horiz
With the wood to fell with the subtract of the forest .
Or , in the case of Yanomami , are the disease that have come with the golden of the gold .
If we move on to the Tibet mountains of the Tibet , where I 'm doing a lot of research , you see the hard flight of politics .
As you know the genocide , the physical extinction of a popular popular , is convicted to the level of the estyle of a popular life , not only is not just , but I even will celebrate in certain environments , because it 's not just not only is not just , but to celebrate part of the development .
And you can 't understand the Tibet 's suffering of Tibet until you 're in the beginning .
I 've been there in the 6,000 miles from Chengdu in China through the west Tibet soul , and coming in Lhasa with a young connection , but just came to to Lhasa young connection , but just came to the statistics we hear .
6,000 sacres reduced in dust and cenhanced .
1.2 million people killed by the military , in the Cultural revolution .
The father of this guy was ascriticized at Panchen Lama .
which means that it was killed in the temple of the Chinese invasion .
Her was falled with Santity in Santity during the diaspora that has brought the popular in Nepal .
Her mother was imprigioned and his colpe was to be rich .
It was brought to the age of two years old by hidden in the age of two years , under his wouldn 't have any of him .
The sister , which did the same thing , it was put in reducation .
A day he inavailable of a day , a wearing cofferent Mao and , for this transgression , was put in the jobs for seven years .
The Tibet of Tibet can be unoverbutable , but the spirit of the popular is from tener present .
Events finally , all of them reduces a choice .
We want to live in the monothic world of the monothic world of the monothic of diversity ?
The great anthropologiet Mead , before he said that his biggest fear was that , in our way to our add , to our add vision to this , we will not just see the whole range of human imagination reduced to a modality of human imagination , but a day we 're going to wake up from a sleep , and we 're going to get out of the possibility .
And it 's umillion years old .
The Neolitics Rifle-focused agriculture , which has done us underfied us to the seed of the seed of the smooth , with the pros of the skid , and we talk about 10,000 years ago .
The modern industrialized world has 300 years .
That 's story , I don 't suggests that we have the answers to all the challenges we 're going to have to do in the millennia to come .
When they 're in these cultures of the world is asked what it means to be human , they 're asking with 10,000 different voices .
And it 's in these answers that we all have the possibility of being what we are : a kind of conscious , that has to make all the populations and all the gardens can be . And there 's great moments of optimism .
I 've been taken this picture on the northwaste of Baffin the island , when I went to the whales with Inuit , and this man , Olaya , Olaya wonderful story of his grandfather .
The English government has not been given with the Inuit 's popular with the Inuit and in the ' 50s to stbilizes our supremise , we 've required them in colonies .
The grandfather of this man refused to go .
The family , I teming for his life , took him off all of his attention .
You have to know that Inuit , they 're not cold , they use it .
The peats of the slitters in origin were made of pain .
The grandfather of this man did not intimight at night or from the library , or from the library .
It 's sgattaiolded , it 's calculated the pantalone in the foca skin and defecated in your hand . When I did it , I got them to do it , and you 're working a mobile .
It 's spruzzed on the dog of this colding teless , and when he came solid , he killed a dog .
It 's been taken the dog and created a brighter , with the tool cass created a slitta , and he 's disappeared to another chane and it 's disappear on the bunch , hand-hand-hand-handed .
We want to talk about cavarself-with nothing ? [ Radies . And this , in different ways , [ Applausi is the symble of the popular Inuit and all of the indigenous popular people of the world .
In the april of the California government return has redded the total control of an area of a larger territory of the California and Texas of the California and Texas mave .
It 's the new check . It 's called Nunut .
It 's an independent territory . They 're going to go .
One example of the as a natione-state can rereconciliate with his popular .
And , to finish , I think it 's pretty obvious at the people who have been in these remote arts of the planet , realized that they 're not remote .
For somebody 's home .
They represent sexual human imagination that are going to be raised to the dawn of the children , like the dreams of these children , become part of our children , become part of the hope .
Finally , we have a convinced of us , we convinced that politicians will never come out .
We believe that the polemid --
[ unclear ] they 're not persuasive , but we believe that the stories can change the world , and maybe we 're the best institution to tell stories of the world . Every month of the world . Every month of our website .
156 countries have spit our television channel .
Our reviews are threads of millions of people .
Our work is traveling in the etnosphere to bring our mark in places that are going to be able to get our audience , and will be able to get out of how they have seen and , you will , and you hope , abbrat the world of anthropology , and we have to find a life in the diversity , and we have to find a life in the world of pluralist and multicultural style and multicultural sticks in a world ,
where wisdom of all the population can contribution to our collective well-being collective well-being .
Thank you .
I 'm going to talk about some things that I wrote in this book that I hope I 'm going to be called and proversus some of the connections , in case , you don 't notice them .
I want to start with what I call " the " official dogma official . "
The official dogma of what ?
The official dogma of all the West industry of the West , the official dogma , " If we want to massive well-being of our citizens . "
The reason is , from one side , in fact that liberty is in itself a value , is a value , is a value , is essential for human beings .
On the other one of us can act for the other thing that if we 're free , each of us can act for all of what massive our well-being , without no one that you decide in the name of our well-being , without any one that you decide .
The way to massive to massive freedom is massive .
More choices people have , the more free , and the more of the freedom , the more of them is their well-being .
This , I think , it 's so deeply royed in society that nobody would dream to put it in doubt .
And it 's also deeply rooted in our lives .
I 'm going to show you some examples of what progress has made possible .
This is my supermarket . It 's not particularly big .
I loved a simple note on the conditions for the saved .
In my supermarket , there are 175 conditions , without content about 10 variety of oil oil oil and 12 acets of the olive and 12 acets that you can buy for a huge number of conditions of the fire surrounding in the cross-to-hand-a-proning circumstance that nobody 175 proning to your own degree .
Here is what the super-market .
Then you go to the store of electronics to buy a stereo : you know , the lector , piaright , the lector .
And in this single electronic store , there 's a big number of components .
We can do six million different and a half of different combinations using the components that there are only one store .
You have to admit that there 's a lot of choice .
Other fields : the world of communications .
Once , when I was a child , you could get all the telephones that were forced by Mom Bell .
It was going to get the phone , you didn 't buy it .
A consequence of that , the phone was that the phone never would break .
These days are gone .
We 've got a variety of telephones , which is especially between the mobile phones .
Here 's the cell phones of the future .
My favorite is the one in the middle , reader MP3 , ball of nose and forces for the crying and force for the crying me .
If you don 't have yet seen the store in the house , you 're very well certain you 're early going to come .
And what happens is that people are in the stoppes and it 's this question . And you know what 's the answer ? The answer is " No .
It 's not possible to buy a mobile phone that doesn 't do too much .
So , in other life that are much more important than the acquired of the acquired , the same plosion of choices .
Axistence , the other than the United States that you go from the doctor and the doctor you say what you have to do .
And he goes , you go to the doctor , and the doctor says , " OK , we could do A , or B , " A has these benefits and risks . What you want to do ? "
You say , " Would you say , what should I do ? "
And the doctor says , " You have these benefits and risks , and you have these benefits and risks . "
" What do you want to do ? "
And you 're rebat , " Would you do that ? "
And the doctor : " But I 'm not . "
The result of the word " autonomy of mality , expression that makes it look like a beautiful thing .
But it 's actually not that a deal with the weight and responsibility to make decisions from somebody who knows something , which is the doctor , to somebody else who knows -- and so certainly not about -- and so in the condition to make decisions of patient .
There 's a huge marketing of pharmaceutical products , direct to people like me and you , that if you think you have no sense , because we can 't buy them .
But if we can 't buy them , because you 're public ?
The answer is that they want to domorning , we call the doctor to ask them to change the recipe .
So , a fundamental thing like our identity is a question of choice , how you see in this jewish , " We don 't want to force children . " We don 't want to force the children . " We don 't want to give the children .
And we can reinvented how many times we get it .
which means that every morning , at the risk , you have to decide that kind of person want to be .
I 've been the family and marriage , a time the common perspective , a common time , which was that you were married the most pron possible , and it started to get the most pron possible .
The only real choice was with who , not when , and not when , and even what do after .
Over the day , it 's really to play .
I teach students very smart students , and I do 20 percent of work than a time .
And it 's not because they 're brilliant , not because they 're not not because they 're undiligent .
but why are I impensive , intent , intent to ask , " Would I say , " Would I say , " Would I do it now ? "
" Would I say , " Would I think before ? I have to think before , or the career ? "
They 're interrogatives .
And they 're trying to answer these questions , even if this implications , not to get the compitor and I 'm not getting a beautiful vote to my exam .
And they really have to do it . They 're important .
Now , the work : we 're lucky , like Carl underweath , because technology allows us to work every day , every day , from every day , from every day , on the planet , except from Hotel Randolph .
I 'm talking about , there 's a corner , and I won 't tell anyone , where the WiFi works .
I don 't tell you , because I want to use it .
What does this mean , this amazing freedom of choice that we have to work ? It 's really to decide , continually at every time , if we have to work or not .
We can go to see our son playing hot with the mobile phone , with the mobile phone , the Blackberry in the other , and the notebook , typically , on the glasses .
And even if they 're all spents , every minute that we see our child , we 're also asking the partner , we 're also asking this , " I 'm going to answer this called ? "
" I have to answer this email ? I have to get this letter ? "
And even when the answer is " no , " all this makes the experience of your game , very different from what would be in other conditions .
So , anywhere we look , little things , big and big things , and big , materials and life , life is a question of choices .
Once the world was this : Of , there were some possibility , but it wasn 't a question of choice .
The world of today is going to look like this : The dilemma is , " Is it positive , or negative ? "
The answer is Sweet .
The positive latest latest bits .
All this choice compories two negative effects on people .
The first , the first paradoxically is that produced paralysself .
With a lot of options between which choosing , becomes very difficult to do it .
I give you a meaningful example : a conduct on the volunteer path .
A connected of a whole thing that was a lot of the Vannual data , the gigantic society , with about a million of a million clients in 2,000 different companies .
What she found is that for every 10 solutions that are offered in more , the percentage of adesion , the percentage of two percent .
With 50 offers fund , there 's 10 percent in less than adhhesions than when they are only five . Why ?
Because with 50 fourds between which choosing , is maledettly difficult to decide , and choice is remained to be in the initially deciding ,
And I wonder , and I wonder , tomorrow , and I , of course , and of course , and of course , and of course , of course , and I think , and of course , and I wonder , and I wonder , I wonder , I wonder , and of course , and I wonder , and I wonder , and of course to wonder , tomorrow , and
You know , it doesn 't mean just that these work from old work from the old people , because they 're not going to get enough money , it means that the decision is so forgiven that the decision is so host that allow the complete source of work .
They 're not going to be participating up to five thousand dollars a year from the work , which would be well disposed to green them .
So , the paralisis a consequence of having too much choices .
And I think that makes the world like this .
" And finally , " for ethchup , send , " or maion , senape or maion ? "
You 'd like to take the right decision , if it 's for ethernity , right ?
You don 't want to choose the wrong background , and you don 't want to choose the wrong condition .
So this is the first effect . The second is that we can avoid paralysis and do a choice , at the end , we 're less suddisfacts of how we would have been with less options to be done by options in which choose .
And this for a lot of reasons .
One of these is that with a lot of conditions from which to choice , if you buy one and it 's not very perfect , it 's easy imagining that you could have been better . And what 's going on is that alternative to imagine you 're going to be better . And what 's going on is that alternative to imagine , and the repair the sodatisfer the decision , and the repair the repair the sodatic , and the repair the sodatic , and you have been very straigy to make a very much of the same .
even when it was a great decision .
Once choices are , it 's easier to displeased than any detail that it 's unsatic is unsatives .
And also , there 's what economists call expensive expensive .
Dan Gilbert : Desigbert has very well stamattina as the value of things depends on what we confronted them .
Of course , when there are a lot of options , it 's easy to represent feature to the highnative feaments of the alternative showing and be less satisfacts of the option that you have .
Here 's a example . I 've been schooling with all of the ones that are not New York .
But that 's what you would probably think .
There 's this copy in Hampons .
A lussian place .
It 's splendida . Otly . It 's all for them .
It 's nothing . But what he thinks about is , " Well , males , and it 's Agoam . "
" Everybody 's neighbors in Manhattan are away . "
" I could talk about your home . "
And it goes two weeks of the idea that 's persing -- every day -- every day -- the possibility of parking where it wants .
The constantly decrease of what we have , even when the choice was excellent .
And the options that we have to look at , the more the attractive feature will be return to us to constant as constant .
Here 's another example .
This is telling us a lot of things .
It 's about the moment , and maybe in the life of the living slowly .
But the most important point is that you want to go , you get down to the other .
The things that we don 't choose to be a lot of attractive , that can make less attractive what we do .
Third point : spiral growing of the expectations .
I tried it on my skin buying a new jeans .
I 'm almost always jeans .
Once the jeans were just a kind of , buying them and besty , they were besty , and they were besty , just after having a life and works , and a lot of times , started going well .
So , I went to buy a couple of when the old people went , and I said , " I need a couple of jeans , this is my cut . "
The commit said , " Ladies you want slim , fit , the fit , the relationships ? "
Do you want to do with the cernier or the buttons ? " Stonewashed ? "
" Would you like striced ? "
" Would you want to walk or stretch ? Bla blah blah .
I was sbalord , and after a little bit , I was able to say , " I want the guy to say , " I want to know , " I want to do all of maledites , and I got out of the jeans , and I was out of the best jeans , and I was out of the best jeans I had ever had .
It was the massive .
But I felt worse .
Why ? I wrote a whole book for understanding it .
The reason I was worse is that with all that choice is that with all that choice the jeans had to be perfect .
I was going to be a minute of a little bit . I didn 't expect to do anything except when there was a 100 different guy , but when I saw 100 different steps , at least a kind of a kind of perfect .
What I had buy was good , but not perfect .
After I had a paragoned that I was trying to do with what I was trying to do in comparisative .
The adding options in life of the people don 't do that increasing the expectations that these have respect to the excellence of options themselves .
And this will be less satifying , even when the results are good .
Nobody in the marketing is about it .
Because if they knew , you 're not aware of what I 'm talking about .
The truth look more like this .
" You better , when he was worse , " The reason that was better when he was worse was worse was even worse to you could meet some surprised surprised and pleasure .
Over the world , we live in -- the world we live in -- opulent , industrialized industrialized that we can hope is that we can hope is that things are at the altitude of expectative expectative .
You 've never been surprised , because your expectations , my expectations , I 've got to be surprised .
The secret of happiness -- what you 're here -- is , " Baxis is , " Yes , " Yes , " You want . "
I mean , I mean , I 'm self-biographic and my wife is really amazing .
I couldn 't do that much , I couldn 't do that .
But it 's not always a bad thing .
And finally , a consequence of buying a couple of jeans when you have just that jeans is that when you 're not satisfacts , and ask you , " Why ? "
" Who is responsible ? " , the answer is clear .
The world is responsible . What can I do ?
When there are hundreds of types of jeans , and you buy a insophister , and ask you who ask you who are responsible , is the clear , it 's the clear of you .
You could have better .
And with hundreds of variety variety variety variety of variety variety , there are no existence .
So when people are taking decisions , even if the results are wild , they feel unsatives , they 're feeling and give the colame , they 're feeling .
In the last few years , the depression is exploded in the industrialized world .
I think a meant factor -- not the only one , but important -- of this wave is that people have delusion , and people have too high .
And when they have to explain this is that they think the colame .
So the final result is that we 're better , objectively , but we feel worse .
Let me remember you .
This is the official dogma , what we all take for good and it 's completely fell . It 's not true .
There 's no doubt that a little bit of choice is better than I have not been able to have any good at all , but it 's not derived that a lot of choice is better than a little bit .
There 's a critical value , magic . I don 't know what it is .
But I 'm sure we 've been done by a piece of a piece where choices are better .
Now , from the political point of view -- I almost finally -- from the political point , the nocctually is the following .
What allows you all this choice in the industrial society is the material .
There are a lot of places in the world , and you know , where the problem is not that they have a choice .
The problem is that they have too pok .
So the factory I 'm talking about is a malbeing exclusive to the rich , the rich society .
And what it does to do and climbing is this : Steve Levitt . And what 's like that expensive and discoveries of the baby and discoveries of baby are unuseful .
I mean that these choices , complicated and avdious , it 's not that they 're just unuseful .
I 'm sure I 'm deleteries .
They 're worse to them worse .
If a little bit of what we have in our society , it allow a little choice was reversed in those where people are too few possibility , it doesn 't just their life to improve , but also .
This is what economists call a paretian improvement .
A redistribution of income re-distribution of all -- not just to the poor -- because of this choice in excess , and it 's going to get us .
So , you can get it , " You can become all what you want . "
You , you 're going to think , " What does that fish ? "
" It 's obvious that you can 't get anything in a glass . "
" A recastrated vision , a recently view of the world --
and I 'm going to be able to do this this , at the beginning .
But then , I realized , I 'm realized that that the fish is long .
Because the reality of the facts is that if you 're sitting in the box , so that " all you can 't get freedom . "
If you break the cut down in a way that all dive as possible to decrease satifation .
You excited about the paralisis , and you reduced the well-being .
Everybody needs a sphere .
This is almost certainly too close , maybe even even for the fish , and certainly sure for us .
But the absence of a few symbolic sphere is a recipe for infelity and , for a sudden .
Thank you very much of the heart .
