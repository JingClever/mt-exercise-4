The glacial I showed these slide demonstrate that the calotta glacial calotta , which for almost three million years had had the size of 48 continental .
But it 's a subjourney of the problem because it doesn 't show the spent of the ice of the ice .
The glacial calotal cycle is , in a sense , the heart heart heart heart of climate system .
You know , you 're invertiser and down .
The next slide will be a rapid carrelated to the last 25 years .
The ice acts are signed in red .
You see , you 're going to go to the blue .
That 's the ice in the inverno , which you ritizen .
You can see that the cosidamage , of five years or more , it 's as a blood , which is as a blood , which is a blood of the body .
In 25 years , it 's past , in this .
This is a problem because the recenter , the whole thing is the ice ice ice ice ice ice , where there are enormous amount of carbon congelated , which , you want to transformed in metan microbes .
I 'm going to spend the totalks of the inquining atmospspread , that amount could be dopay , super---re-return .
In some laghi profound in Alaska metan is already rebolling by the water .
The professorse Katey Walter of Alaska is recated with a team of a pressed team with a team of a fast last last last last last last last sunnake .
Video : Wow ! Al Gore : You 're good . The question is if we 're going to be .
And it 's a reason is that this is the termical replacing the Groenland from the northern north .
This is a glacial fiume to the glacial record .
The labed was never reached to the similar .
This is the Kangerlussuaq , in the west of the Groenland .
If you want to know how to be the level of the sea level of the sea , you know , there 's where the sea .
These wind are going to be rapidly .
The other part of the planet : Antartide , the largest block of ice ice ice ice on the planet .
The month of the scientists have diqueen that the bilankror is in negative , and that Antartide Western , which is a little bit of the sun , which is particularly faster in the sun , it 's particularly in the sun .
It 's a six feet of the level of the acque , like Groenland .
Sull Himalaya , the third larger block of ice , you see new laghi , which was a glacious ball , which was ice ice .
At percent of the world population will remainly get water of a potail .
Sulle Ande : this ice ice ice ice is the source of the water .
The landed was increased .
But when it diminuuifes , the same happens to the water .
In California the neighborhood in the Nevada is diminugal .
The idrics are in crisis .
The predictions , as you read , they 're great .
The growth for severe severe .
The disaster environmental disaster , they 're going to be a normal and without previous .
Four times more numbers in the last 30 years of previous than 75 .
This is a whole sustainable of all insustainable .
If you look at the historic context , if you can see the consequences .
In the last five years we added 70 million tons of CO2 every 24 hours -- 25 million tons of the ocean every day .
Look at the time of the Pacific , from the west area , in the west , and in both of the subcontinent parts of the subcontinent , where there is a imor of the existence of the oxygen in the ocean .
The major cause of global warming , together to the deforestation , which is the 20 percent , it 's the use of sum .
The oil is a problem , and the carbon is even worse .
The United States are one of two of two countries with the most emissions , together to China .
And you 'd propost to build many other cents in carbon other cents .
But we 're going to be a changing change of direction .
These are the projects that they anullated in the last years and some of the versus .
And there 's a political lovely in our country .
The carbon industry and the oil have spent 250 million dollars in the last year to promote the carbon , which is a bunch .
And that image I remember something --
I see Natal , in Tennessee , where I live , there was a loss of 3.8 billion lililikers .
Maybe you saw about the news .
This is the largest second flussian fluss in America .
It 's happened around Natale .
The publishing of one of the carbon industry was this .
Video : Frosty the carbon is a allegro and happy .
It 's abundant here in America , and it 's growing our economy .
Frosty the carbon is always more pulit .
It 's a good price , it 's a good price , and the maintain sent .
Al Gore : You have here a lot of the carbon of West Virginy .
The biggest society 's a labor to Massey Coal . This is his friender .
Video : Don Blankenship : Sarm , Nancy Peless , Nancy Peless , Harry Reid -- they don 't know what they 're talking about .
Al Gore : So the Alleance for the Proteition of Clima has launched two campaign .
This is a part of them .
Video : ALergy : Alla COLergy see the climate change as a sery sery in our business .
So , we have a very priority is to invest a lot of money in a source to be able to make public public , and confused the verity of the carbon .
In fact , it 's not sporite .
We think it 's clean -- it 's also a good profuel .
So you don 't precumatic climate change .
Let me do it to us .
Video : Acore : Carbone , you 've heard a lot of speak .
So we do all saving a whole structure at the saving of the pulit , it 's going to be a clean .
Straordinary ! The cars are a little rumorous rumorous , but this is the sound of the pulit technology .
The fuel consumer is between the main of the main of global warming , but the remarkable technology , but the very very clean technology of the puzzy that you see changing everything .
You have a eye : this is the odiergain technology .
Al Gore : Inally , the alternative alternative , and the national alternational security .
Video : How much : The America is in crisis ; the national economy , the national climate crime .
The file that connects all : our dependence of the supply , as the carbon sporite and oil oil oil oil .
Now , there 's a new , audace ,
Repower , 100 percent of energy energy , in 10 years .
A plan to remain America to work , make sure us sure , and help us to stop the global warming .
It 's actually , a solution that we basts our problems .
Repower of America . Scoprite more .
Al Gore : This is the last last .
Video : You can report energy to America .
One of the most fastest ways to bring to dependence from the combuy of the combustible that killed our planet .
So , the future is here . It 's the future is here .
Compars two : Novi investment for places of work ,
Anyourour-America . It 's time to be realists .
Al Gore : A African old , you know , " If you want to go fast , you go to the weight .
If you want to go away , you go together . "
We have to go away , fly .
Thank you very much .
LHC . last year at TED , I 've been a introduction on the LHC .
And I promise to traveling up and behind it out how the car works .
So there was no one . And for the time there were no , the LHC is the largest experiment ever , there were no big experiment , 27 kilometers of the conference .
Her complished is to reach the conditions that were at less than a million than the first one of the universe -- until 600 million times at the second .
All that 's just environment .
This is the car under Ginevra .
We 're doing these min-Big Bang in the Big Bang in the respectats .
This is what I work . It 's called ATLATLAS -- it 's larger 44 feet and has a diameter .
This is a spectacular picture of ATLAS in building so you can see the proportion .
To 10 sets of the last year we have acceso the car for the first time .
And this picture was taken by ATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLAS .
It was because of immense stops in the health of control .
It 's a picture of the first fashion of particles that had done all the LHC , both in collision , in the HC , and it 's particles in the HC , and spread particles into the reflist .
In other words , when we see that picture the 10 settember , we realized that the machine was going to work , which is a great vittory .
I don 't know if it was this to be able to do more or this , when somebody went on on Google and vivide that the page begin .
What means we had a cultural impact beyond the scientific impact .
And I was a week later , there was a problem with the car , had to have this here -- these file bers here -- these brought hored ored .
These brought 13,000 practice when the machine works at the massive of potence .
Now , technique between you look at the children and say , " It 's not true . They 're too too too much sound . " It 's too too much sound . "
And they can do it because when they are very cosiddled the super-file ,
So , at least 271 degrees , at least 271 degrees of the space between the stars , these things can bring that the wind .
In one of the guntures between the most novehicle magneti in the LHC , there was a defect of fabmiration .
So the file of the file , they 'll give you a slightly met , and 13,000 practical resistence .
This was the result .
Now , this is more impressive if you think that these magneti fish are going to think that these magneti fish are moving about 30 centimeters .
They are damong about 50 magneti .
We had to take them , what we did .
We 've been repressed and travel .
They 're going to be all at their sub-to--to-land .
I 'm going to marird the LHC is going to be again integrate .
We 'll be going to be , and we expecting us to get data or the right data , and we continue to find what we 're the morning ning to find what are the morning ning ning the universe .
Now , of course , in a certain way , these accidents return the dibutt of science and engineering the value of science and engineering in the engineering of the engineering of the engineering . It 's easy to be to conflict .
I think the fact that the fact that it 's hard , the fact of the limitititchen things like the LHC .
I 'd like to conclude with the words of a English scientist , Humphrey , which , I guess , in difense , in difenaby , his publicl , his publicl , his publlics , he said , " Nist , he said , " Nist said , " Nist , which is that there 's a dangerous , which is not a whole whole whole whole whole .
Thank you .
I want to start to ask you to rethink when , you 're played by children , played the morning ,
And as you know how to get them and try and get them , and you 're going to move them , and you know , you know , and you know , we 're going to be able to think and solve the space .
The space space is deeply connected to the way we understand the way we understand the world around us .
So , from information usually , from the usulity of our interaction with the physical objects , together to my own Patch , and my collaborator , and my collaborator , I started asking me , I started asking me , " And if we use a computer , but when we use a computer , you know , we could have the digit to be a sor , potential of a sor , potential of the hands of the hands of the hands ,
and it looks like our please ?
The question was so interesting that we decided to explore the answer , which we were built the Siftable .
In a few words , a Siftable computer is a great interactive as a biothing .
In a few words , a Siftable computer is a great interactive as a biothing .
You can move with the hand , they can see the hand , " you can see the right movement and they have a screen and a radio wireless .
But it 's a physicians , as the physicians , like the morning , they can just be affected .
The Siftable is the example of a new ecosystem to manipulate information
And as they become more physicians , conscious to conscious , and other , and and as they become more physicians , conscious to be the way , of how we die , we can explore new new and different ways of interinteraction .
So I 'm going to start with some simple example .
This Siftable is configurate to show the video : if you put it in a direction , the video rotherwise , the hit 's going back .
These reactive reactive are conscious to others .
If you know , you know , they 're interested in what it 's going to be around .
If they 're circummed , and they can do a little bit .
If they 're circummed , and they can do a little bit .
They also have their movement and inclination .
We 've got to realize that one of the interinteracting of the interaction was able to be able to use the common data , to example , for example , to the color as if it was a liquid .
In this case , we have three Siftable configurate as a bunch of vernice and I can use them to the color in the cental , where you miles are mistakes .
and I can use them to the color in the cental , where they miles are missing .
If we 're too too , we can get a little bit .
I 'm also good possibility of appractice , like the language , and games where the mathematics and games where people can try the things to be able to be able to see the result of the immediately .
Now I 'm --
This is a Fibonacks I do with a Fibonacks I do with a equations .
We have a game of words that 's a half of the Scarabeo and Byyyourself .
Pratically , at every turnnurs a receive literally in every Siftable , Pratically , at every single turnnable , and while you try to get a drug in the Sifable of the words .
Then , after about 30 seconds are remised , and you have a new labs of labor and new chance to try .
Thank you .
Here 's how to the children came in in the Media Lab , I did it so that I tried them and I 've been shown a video .
They are very pleased .
And one of the things of this kind of thing that is not to have to have to have a lot of education .
You just say , " Compons of words , and they know exactly what do .
Here 's how to other people who are going to try .
This is our young tester tester than there 's a younger , there 's the right .
It was actually wanted to do it .
They 're only in the moron-hone-morning , for him .
Now , this is a application of a interactive chart .
We wanted to build a tool for the process of the Lui language is Felix .
It can be able to new characters in the saving Siftable .
It can be able to new characters in the saving Siftable .
That 's , it 's doing the sun .
Video : The sun is source .
David Merrill : Now she took a treat a scene .
Video : The treat treat the horse .
Bel work ! Yeah !
So , I schooling the Siftable and put close to interact the characters --
Video : Bau !
-- inventing the story .
Video : Her !
DM : It 's a story with the open , and it can decide him how you svolts .
DM : It 's a story with the open , and it can decide him how you svolts .
Video : Video : Video .
DM : The last example I have the time to show you is a time to show you is a recent tool , to samong and exeguing music .
It 's a recent tool , it 's a recent tool and exeguing music .
The Siftable here are aging to be like the basis and bacteria .
Each of these has four different variations , and you can choose what you use .
You can also also put these sound in a sequence from the comporing of your pleasure .
And it just to be able to touch a sound , and a sequence . "
These are actually able to control from the vial , like the reverber and the filtrum .
You attacks to a particular , and then inclins to travel .
And then there are the general effectively as time and volume , which is going to be able to the sequence .
We look like it works .
Video : We 'll be able to put a base in two Siftable sequence , we 're going to be , we add to a series , we add to , we add the basic .
Now I put a bottom line .
Video : Now I add of the percussions --
Video : And I 'll put the filter to the bacteria , so I can control the bacteria , so I can control the effect of the vial .
Video : I can fast the intersequence , the intersequence , the inclining time from one side or another .
Video : And now I 'll add the filter to the mot to give more expression .
Video : I can recombine the sequence of the fly sequence . "
So I don 't have to planning it before , but I can improve , return it again , and I can improve , and I can 't improve it .
And now , I can spend the whole sequence , I can spend the Siftable to the Siftable to the Siftable . "
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is to build new new interfaces like the more sound like our brain and body .
And today , I 've had time to show you one of the result of this load , and also some chance that we try to bring out of the lab .
The concept I want to transmit is that 's coming to this new generation of objects to interact with digital media , which will bring information in our world .
Thank you very much .
I don 't see the hour to talk to all of you .
I 'm a wrote .
I 'm going to be bookely my profession , but it 's more than that , of course .
It 's also love and the fashion and the fashion of my life .
And I don 't expect that it can change .
But , he said this , something particular happened in my life and in my career , which has taken me to recently recently , which has taken me to recently it with this work .
The particular thing is I 've been written this book , this white biography called " Mandia , Prra , which is , diversity from my previous books , for some reason used in the world and become a great feelational , besty , the international feelational .
And the result is that everywhere to go now , people treatment like if you were concerned .
It 's true -- you know , it 's constructed .
They 're all worried to me , and say , " You don 't fear to be able to do better ?
You don 't have a fear to write for all life without able to be able to create a book that can be able to make a book that can be able to be able to be able to create a book that can be able to be able to create a book that can be able to create a book that could be able to be able to create a book that could be able to create a book that could be able to create a book that they can be able to create a book that can 't be able to be able to create
which can be important to somebody ? "
It 's unsurance , you know .
But it may go worse , at the way I remember that I remember that more than 20 years ago , when I begin to say people -- I was a wrote .
And I was inagainst the same reaction , it 's a lot of the fear .
And people said , " Do I don 't have to be success ?
You don 't have a million of the refit to kill you ?
You don 't have a fear to do this mestius for all of life without anything about it out and die on a cure mule of dreaming with the boundable , with the bunch of failure ? "
So , you know .
The short answer to all these questions is , " Yeah . "
I 'm fear of all those things .
I always had a lot of paper .
And I also have a lot of other things that people may not inhit .
As the allow and other things spent .
But , as about how I writing what I thought and I 'd ask me last monstrstraight me is because ?
Is it . "
It 's logic that everyone is to expect to be spent from a job that you sent to be spent for .
But what 's in this particular , in the impress creative creative , you know , it 's a minute health to the mental health of the minds of the other charge .
How my father , for example , he was a chemical engineer and not remember one time in his 40 years of activity where the time in his 40 years of activity that he had been asked ?
We had never -- that block of the engineer John , how does it ?
It didn 't work like that , right ?
Onestly , the chemical engineers like they don 't certainly , in the seual reputation of the reputation of the reputation of the depressive to be alcolized .
We have a scrators , we have enough this reputation , and not just writers but creativity of every kind of , we have this reputation of it .
And it 's not to be the other than you look at the trials of the magnifments that only in the ventesuum century , they die young people and often for hand .
And even the ones that you don 't really have to be disappeared by their dones .
Nortman Mailer , before I 'm going to die , in the last interview said , " Every little bit of a little bit more of the extraordinary of the work of your life .
But we don 't know , we heard this , because we heard these things so much long that we 've been interiorized and accepted the notion that the notion that creativity and the suffering of the notion that creativity and the argument are in some way , and that the art , it will be a few of lap .
And the question I want to take all today is : you 're agree with this idea ?
You know this thing -- because it 's also looking at a centimeter of a distance to me not good for anything to this support .
I think it 's odious .
And I think it 's also dangerous and I don 't really want to see the next century .
I think it 's better to encourage our big creative minus .
And I sually know , in my case -- in my case -- it would be very dangerous to start to be able to start to be able to be able to be able to be in the circircircircircircircircircircircircircircircumstances where I 'm in my career .
Of course -- I 'm looking at , I 'm pretty young , I 'm quite young , I 'm quite young ,
I 've got about four decades of work in me .
And it 's very likely to write that anything I writing it 's right now going to be right from the world like the work that used to be able to happen .
He 'll be slaving , because we are all more or less friends here -- it 's likely to my big success is to my big success .
Oh , Gesus , who thought !
You know this is the kind of thought that leading a person to start to be a gin the morning , and I don 't want to do it .
I 'd keep going to continue to do this work .
So , the question is the question to be , like ?
And so I think , after many reflessions , which the way to work to continue to write is to create a psychchologic costroy-protective , OK ?
I had to find a way to find a safety of security between me , I 'm write , and my natural anxial , and I 'm trying to figure out and , while I was trying to get it . And while I was trying to see the time , trying to find more society to see if you could have the best ideas and more and sane to see if they could have have the best ideas and sane to be able to find more than the best and sane . And I 'm going to see if you could have the best ideas of the best .
how to help people believe that people create deal with people creative inerent answers of creativity .
And that research has taken me to the Great and old Rome .
Seguitees because I 'm given in certain and then back .
Nantical , Great and the ancial Rome -- people don 't seem to believe that creativity came to men , OK ?
And he thought that creativity was this spirit look at the divine and that came out of men from a few surprising sunknown , for the distant distant and knowledge .
The green were called these these beings were the waterdians of creativity .
Socrate , wonderful , he believed to have a demon that elarguess from away .
The Roands were the same idea , but they called that the spirit of the spirit .
That 's great , because Rohands didn 't think that a lot of people who were particularly intelligenius .
They think that a genius was this kind of dealing in the dealing of a sign in the study of a artist , a little bit like the elf of the elf of the argument of the argument of the artist work and models the result of that work .
There 's a little bit of -- here , that 's the distance of which is the distance of the psychological construct that you protected from your work .
And they all knew that was so that it was so that it worked , right ?
So , the artists were protected from certain things , like for example , the way , so for example , no ?
If you 're doing it , you couldn 't take it all the right right , you know that the herself , all of you know that the incorporate .
If you 're going to failed your work , it wasn 't all cold , right ?
They all knew that was your genius to be a inable .
And so people han conceive the sent people in Occient for a long time .
Then the Rinascivement came and all changed , and nacts this big idea ; we put the human being in the center of the universe over all the way over the universe .
This was the real humans of rational humans and people began to think that creativity came to think that creativity came from the idivided .
And for the first time in the story , you 're going to referirst to this or a kind of genius to a rather than a genius .
And I have to say , I think that was a big mistaining .
I think you know somebody , a simple person of creating a very simple person to think of as a recipient as a source of all the misters divins , creativity , and unknown , and eternable and eteriial responsibility to the fragile psyc . .
It 's like to ask somebody to ingoize the sun .
It shape and dematic .
And I think it 's been this pressure to have destructed the artists in the 500 years .
And if this is true , and I think that it 's the question is , and now ?
We can do it diversity ?
Maybe I got to a more antical comprench of human relationship between human relationship and mistery .
Or maybe not .
Maybe we can 't have 500 years of rational thinking in a 18 minutes .
And there 's people between the audience that sollevers would be lawy--the-sospread , you know that they follow people to spring the next people in the way , or they 're going to do that .
I 'm not going to convince you all about this thing .
But the question I 'd like to take is -- because no ?
Why don 't you think that in this way ?
Because it has more sense of anything that I 've ever heard to explain the impreveal exassum of the creative process .
And one process that 's a whole process that has ever been tremendous to do something -- so , all here -- you know , you don 't understand .
And , in fact , it can sometimes seem to be completely paranory .
I did this inagainst the extraordinary Ruth Stone , who has 90 years , but he was a poeter for all of life and said that during his life and said that during his childhood in the rural Virginia , and he felt , if a poeter was coming from the painting .
He said that was like a fragorous tracy .
And that was coming out of her from the landscape .
It 's going to feel , because it was to save the land under his feet .
He knew that was to have one thing to do that point and was of , he was , he walk like a math . "
And so it 's going to reward the house and it was going to be able to be able to get a piece of card and a little bit enough enough , while the traph , while the traped , while the traph , and he was going to get the page .
Sometimes I couldn 't be enough enough , so it was really faster and correcrecreceive and correct without able to get home and the poem , and she had been going through through the landscape , and she had to source through the landscape , trying , like she said , " as she said , " he said , " a little bit . "
Then there were the time -- this piece of not dementiches , I 'll never say -- there were some of the moments where the was almost lost , OK ?
So , he was going to go home and she was trying to the poesids and the poetime through , and he was going to be a math in the time , and then said , that it was like if you slow with the other hand and the step .
He was the poetiiify from the coda and the spread in his body and translation was on the page .
And in these cases , the poem would be presented on the perfect page , but the word at the last word at the last word .
So when I feel thinking -- it 's pathesizy , it 's exactly ugual at my creative process .
Not all my creative process -- I 'm not a construct .
I 'm a mule , and my way to work is ; I 'm going to see it , I 'm going to see it up and go down to the herself .
But even I was my own , I 've been taken against that thing , I 've been striped against that thing , sometimes .
And I think that also many of you have the han .
You know , even if the work and ideas came to you .
And what is this ?
And how can we related it in a way to not to do it , but rather , rather , that we have to remain in ?
So , as I 'm a better example , I 'm a better example , I have the musician Tom Waits , which I interviewed different years ago for a day .
We were talking about this , and you know , Tom , for the most of life was the incarnation of life was the incarnation of the argued artist , trying to move , to domining these species of impulses .
But then invent , and he was going to calculate , and he was driving on a car in Los Angeles , changed everything for him .
He was going to go fast and all of a sent tract this little fraging of melodia , which comes in his head as it does the inspiration , and the feeling , and the answer , and the desidpiration , and the desidite desidite , but it doesn 't know how to take it .
He doesn 't have a card of card , it doesn 't have a math register .
So I began to feel this kind of old old old , I 'm going to be going to be in him , " I 'm going to lose , and I 'll recognize it .
I 'm not good enough , I can 't do it . "
And instead of going to go to the panic , you stop .
He was going to put the whole whole process and he had something completely new .
Look at the sky and said , " Scuses , I 'm not seeing that I 'm driving ? "
" Ti seem to write a song ?
If you really want to be , you know , you can get up a more opport , when I can take me me .
Atriments , you know , you know , to be able to implement something today .
You see Leonard Cohen . "
And his process of changed after this .
It 's not the work , the work was still a saving job .
But the process , and the fish that was that he was removed when he was removed when he took the genius , the genius that out of him out of the other that problems and freed it back to where it was going to go back to where it was going to be a whole thing .
but it 's not this peculiar , wonderful bizarre , wonderful bizarre , and this strange and the outside that he was not Tom .
So how I feel that story about it to change a little bit the way I was working in the way I was working and I 've already saving time .
This idea , I was when I was write , I was write , Pra , " and the ball of those cave of the disperation that we 're working on something and we don 't have when we 're working on something and we don 't really think that it will be a disaster , which is the worse book .
It 's not just good , right , right the book .
And I began to think of geping this project .
But then I remember to Tom that I 'm talking about the air and I tried to try .
So I went to my face on the southern and recognize my face , and I got my vacuum ,
And I said to go , " Surch , what , you 're going to be a brilliant not intercolst , it 's not going to be a very colst ?
Because I 'm seeing this , I 'm going to see what I 've got , I don 't have this .
So if you want you to be better , you have to be , and do your part .
OK . But if you don 't do it , you know what , I don 't do anything .
I 'll go to write the same because it 's my work .
And I 'd like to do that that was recorded that I 'm presented to do my part , because -- it 's so , OK -- in the end of the North people were actually showing in the North people of sunper danances that went to the sunning for the sites of the sackites of the ball .
And they were always magnify because the ballerins were fantastic and they were fantastic .
But every way , you know , something happened , and one of these artists had become actually transcuting .
And I know what you know is , because I know that you 've all seen , a certain point , a performance .
It was like if the time , it was like if the massive time , and it was walk through a kind of labor , and it was doing anything else from the solute , and it was all all all of the time .
And at the improviously not look at the solely as a human .
But it 's accese from the divinity in the fuoco of divinity .
And when this was when this happened , you know , people knew what was called him .
They were the hands and began to dot , " Allah , Allah , Allah , God , Allah , God , God , " God , " God . "
That 's God , you know .
And the historical note -- when the More invaser the south of Spaina , I was this above with them and the pronnice changed in the Allah , Allah , Allah , " Ollah , " which you can still feel in the correct , you can still feel in the correct .
In Spaiaign , when a artist did something impossible and magic , " Allah , the nake , I mean , I was a very incompanies , I mean , I was a last thing .
And it 's great because we need .
But , the problem comes the day after , for the ballerine , when you sweather and discover that are the 11 of Martedouble , and last thing about God , and last last thing is there .
It 's just a mortal with a gran bad bad to the ginock , and maybe it 's never more to sell to that allowed .
And perhaps nobody will you know , the name of God still while , and what do you have to do with the rest of his life ?
It 's hard .
This is one of the most pain recognizations to make a life life .
But perhaps it doesn 't have to be so angoal if you can 't believe , and you can 't believe , and that the most extraordinary aspects of your being being from you .
But you 're just creating you have to prested by a very preventure of this team of the inimaginable of your life that you have to go out to something else when you finite .
And , you know , if we think , if we think it 's all changing .
And so I began to think , and it 's sure as I thought for different months during the work of the book that I 'm going to be going to be on , the dangerous , I 'll be followed .
And what I have to continue to me when I feel I feel that I 'm going to keep me from this is not to feel .
It 's not just about your work . It 's just your work .
Continua to presenting you for your part , any can be .
If you work is balling , you ball .
If the divine , it assurgeing , you assigned to leave some kind of wonderful kind of wonderful , for a moment through the foreign , then , " Ole ! "
At triments , you know , you know , your dance .
And " Ole ! " You know , you know .
I think and I think I 'm going to teach it .
" You know ! " You know , even for you have a human love and testing in the tal tal tals from the tal taccount .
Thank you .
Thank you .
June Cohen : Ole !
You 've already been talking about some of these projects on the human genome , what it can mean and the discovery of genes .
We 're beginning to digital , we began to digital , we began to digital biology and now now now we 're coming into a new phase of biology , design and design and intetization .
We always tried to take big questions .
" What is the life ? " It 's something that many biologists have been trying to figure out the liquid .
We 've been trying to different approcessing to the minims .
We 're digitalize for almost 20 years .
When we sequenced the human genome was treated by the world analome of the world of the digital world .
Now we ask , we can we regenerate life , or to create new life from this digital universe ?
This is the map of a little organism , the Mycoplasma genitalium , which is the species of the smallest genome that can authorise in the lab .
And we tried to reduce the genome to create a little bit more little .
We are able to eliminating a hundred of genes of about 500 .
But when we look at his map , and it 's relatively simple respect to our metabolic .
I think , this is simple .
But when we look at all the genes that we can eliminate , one at the time , it 's very improbable that this can bring a living cells .
So we decided that the only to procreative to be synthize this chromosoma in a way to be able to be able to provide some of these questions .
And so we started the resventure of the " we can be called the " C. "
Can you confeeling to produce these big molecules that we 've never been able to create these big molecule that we 've never been able to create before ?
And , in case , we can make a chromosoma ?
A chemical chemical piece of chemical material .
The speed we are able to digitalize life is growing to the exponential life is growing to the exponential life is going to be exponential .
Our ability to write the genetic code , instead , but it 's pretty slowly , but it 's actually improving .
And our more recent results the results of a curve .
We 've been started more than 15 years ago .
The process process of a lot of spaces , began with a bioetic revision before we began to experiments .
But we discovered that I 'm going to be a very difficult .
There are a thousands of cars in the world that producing little segments of DNA , in the long time , in the long time , there 's a degenerative process : the longer sleep .
So we had to develop a new method to assembling these framments and correct the mistakes .
And this was our first tentertainment , in particularly digital , in the digital genome of the genome of the genome of the genome of the genome of the genome of the genome of the genome of the genome of the genome of the genome of the genome of the gen
It 's a little virus that kills .
We designed the fragments , effectured the mistaining of mistakes and get a molecule of about 5,000 leck .
The interesting part is when we took this piece of chemical material , and we put it in the bacteria , the bacteria have started read this genetic code and propering this code and propering the viral particles .
The viral particles are then removed by cells , they 're back and they destroyed the E.
I 've been talking about recent a recent of the oil industry , and they say that they certainly compresor this model .
They have more than you .
We think this is a situation where the software can really build its same hardware in a biological system .
But we wanted to do things more in big things .
We wanted to build the chromosoma of bacteria .
They 're more than 580 mile labor .
So we thought we built it into the size of the size of the virus , so that we can change the casss to understand what the components are the living .
The design is crucial , and if we start with digital information in a computer , these have to be very accurate .
When we sequenced this genome for the first time in 1995 accuratess was a mistaining for every 10 miles .
We discovered , 30 mistake . If we had to use that sequence never been able to be able to be able to do it .
One part of the process is design , in the long , 50 labs that you 're going to be a lot of other segments of 50 labs to build substers of them together .
We have a unique elements here .
You know , you know , we 're saving the fire of the fishing .
Think about this : We have a genetic code on four lectarguing : A , C , Gs and T.
Three of those letters together in about 20 , and there 's about 20 friend of the charge of lyacking , and there 's a specific order to sell .
So we can use the genetic code to write words , frases .
What we did at the beginning is autograpraped to do it .
Some of them were delusi from the fact that it wasn 't a poem .
We designed these segments for a few years .
There are there there are there and put them .
And we started to assembling of the parts , starting with segments from five to seven mile , unending to seven mile , and unending to 24 mile , and only only to get to 72 mile .
We 've made these segments in abundance , so that we 've been able to sequencing that we 're trying to create a extremely robustobustobustobustobble -- as you 'll see in a minute .
We 're trying to self-selling the process .
So , this seems to be the tabellone of the board .
When we get these segments very long , more than 100 miles , more than 100 miles , they will not look at the E.
It 's coming to the modern of modern biology .
So we 've been considered other mechanisms .
We knew about another mechanism called the mechanism , we were usual , which in biology is ulizy to repair the DNA to repair .
Here 's a example .
This organism , called the Deinococcus radioooothern , can assupply .
You can see in the sound of the superior as his chromosound .
In 12 -- 24 hours is replaced like it was before .
They 're able thousands of organisms that are able to do it .
These organisms can sit t .
They can live under the vacuum .
They are absolutely , that life existing in space , and you feel places to find new environments .
And the true , NASA showed that this is .
This is a picture of the molecule we built out with these process , just using the lizen design to be able with the smomoon with design to be to insert .
The lizen assemble le .
This picture is not been taken with a microscope electronic microscope , but with a microscope .
It 's a molecule we can see the whole whole whole whole whole set of lap .
These are pictures that they 're doing a time of about six seconds .
This is the publishing we 've done a little time ago .
They 're more than 580,000 labor .
It 's the biggest molecule of a defined structure .
It 's a lot of weight in 300 million .
If you 're stamp with a 10 without spaces , you 'd like 142 page to be only to spacececting this code .
Now , how do we do it work ?
Of course , tramitely , a virus is a game from kids .
It 's a little more complicated when you use of bacteria .
It 's easier , even when it 's the eyards like our , you can just extremely be the nuclear process and inseries another , which is basically the process of a cloning process .
In the archaaea is the chromosoma is , in the cells , but we recently demonstrated that we 're able to be able to do a complex cell of a chromosoma from one and active .
We 've been able a chromosoma partician .
The two different are how the men from the tops .
We added some gene and more in the way , we could decide what to do for this chromosoma .
And then I 'm going to kill all the proteins .
And when we put it in the cells is study -- and you will prezero-graphic , you 'll be able to the smomounted .
And we were thinking that we weren 't going to go beyond , but we tried to get there .
This is one of the major mechanisms of evolution .
We discovered that many species have added a second or a third chromosoma from some of a little bit , added in a second , and to add in a thousand new tracts to that species .
So who think about the evolution as a only gene and the time you modic , it doesn 't understand a lot of the biology .
They 're sistly called me , it 's a restripping that it 's going to be the diger-restripping DNA .
The chromosoma that was in the cells .
The cell phone phone cell that we 've been inserito--------chap .
It 's expressed , and he recognized the other chromosoma as material , has been recognized , and we 've got to get the cells and the new chromosoma .
It 's become blue because of the genes we 've been insered .
And in a short leep , all the characteristic characteristics of a species are going to lose , and it transformed in a new species , based on the new software that we 've been insered in the cells .
All the protects are changed , the membrane are changed , and when we read the genetic code is what we spend up .
Now , this may seem altering alize , but altering the software , we can change the things in a kind of place .
Now , I 've already explained that here is not about genesis -- but to progress from three million years and a half of evolution , and I said that maybe we 're going to create a new version of the Cambriana .
Why do you do that ?
I think it 's enough obvious when we think about our needs .
We 're going to go from six billion and a half billion people in the next 40 years .
Right to give a example : I was born in 1946 .
Now there are three people on the planet for every none existent in 1946 ; in 40 years , there are going to be four .
We 're doing problems now to find food , water and pull , medical water and wealine , and wine for six billion and a half billion people .
It 's still going to be done to be done to the nine billion .
We 're going to be more than five billion carbon , more than 30 billion baries them .
That means for millions of baries a day .
When we try to find biological processing them , or any kind of process to repay them , it will be a huge challenge .
We have to keep the whole whole emission of the CO2 from these materials that 's going to be in the atmosphere .
At day today , thank you very scientific discoveries in the world , we have a database with about 20 million genes , and I like to think that are the design components for the future .
The electronical industry , it 's just a dozen of a lot of different things are coming out .
We have the limitititely data here , in the biological reality and our imagination .
We have techniniques , thank you very quickly about the synthetization , in order to create what we call genomics .
We 're able to build a big robot that can produce a million chromosomes in the day .
Think about these 20 million genes or to try to get these these these these 20 million genes or drugs , and new vaccines , and we can change , thank , thanks , we can change , thank you , thank you to make more biology in the last 20 years .
And it 's just a standard .
We can choose for the possibility of survival , or chemical , or production or several , production ,
This is an instantanea of some software programmed that we 're working for to be able to set and design species to be able to be able to set and design species .
Well , we don 't know how it will be .
We know exactly it 's the genetic code .
We 're going to focus on the carburant of the fourth of the fourth of the fourth of the fourth of the focusing on the carburs .
You see that you can see that that 's been a lot of it .
We have carbon a second and third generation that use enough to be in the sat at the sorts of higher than the highest value , or different kinds of of of different kinds of of role .
But the only way that the biology can have a big impact without increasing the cost of the food and limititable to be transforming the CO2 in the time , to be transforming the CO2 in the time , to be done to design that , and we think that that the first carbon to be able to be about the time .
The solar light solar light with the CO2 is a metodo-- but in our discoveries in all the world , we found different metods .
This is a organism we 've described in 1996 .
It 's in the ocean , about 2,500 feet of deeply in the ocean temperature of ebollip water .
They think in metilet 's use of the CO2 using hydrogen molecular as source .
We 're trying to figure out if we can indot the CO2 , which can be translated to be translated to tramite that CO2 in the carbon , to drive this process .
So , we could think we could be able to be able to increase what is the question of the basis is that we could be able to be able to be , we have the goal of repair the whole goal of repair the inter-based industry .
Exize . If you don 't do it from TED , where you can ?
It would be a main of energy .
And then we 're working for the same metods to create vaccines .
You 've seen this year with the flu , we 're always back to a dollar in less when it 's going to find the wine .
I think what you can change it .
Here 's how the future might begin to change , now , the tree of the evolution , and then the evolution with the evolution with bacteria , archight , and infinally cells .
We are so much about the best people .
Our discovered is to do a long way to live enough to try to get it . Thank you very much . Thank you very much .
First of all of you 'll see , the faster possible , a new work that we 've taken to the Microsoft in follow a year ago . This is Seadragon . This is Seadragon . This is Seadragon .
It 's a environment where you can interact is in local level that you can interact with a huge amount of data .
We 're seeing a lot of gabyte of digital phoom with a kind of zoom and continuous , for a quoom , for a faster , avoootherwim , aving pictures like we want .
And it doesn 't matter how much much much much much of information that we see , how big you know , as a big data or the picture .
Most of the digital photographs , but this example is a provide of the world of the Bioteca degree of the Congress , and reenter in the gama of 300 megapis .
It 's not a difference because the only thing that 's the prestations of a system like this is the number of pixel on your screen in any time . It 's an architecture . It 's a very fflessible architecture .
This is a whole book , for example of data not to pictures .
This is the Dickens . Every colonna representing a capital .
So , I 'm going to show you that it 's just about the tune , we can do something like that , to see that it 's a real representation of the text , not a picture .
It could be a little artificial way to read a little artificial book .
It 's not to advice it .
This is a more realistic example . It 's a number of the Loook .
Every picture is the beginning of a seition .
And it really gives you really please and the beautiful experience of the shapes of a review , or a review , or a quotidian , which is for nature of a half of a half .
We also have something with the angle of this particular number of the Look .
We created a fashion-resolution-resolutionary , and more alone of that you use a normal publishing , and we insered the extra content .
If you want to see the characteristic cars of this car , you can see here .
Or other models , or even the specific specific technique .
And this really demonstrate some of these ideas to eliminating the limits of space on the screen .
We hope that this means to put a little bit of the p-up and similar , and other porcheries , you don 't have to be necessary .
Of course , the map is one of the most obvious applications for this kind of technology .
And I don 't want to lose time , if we don 't say that we have to the contribute to give it in this field .
These are all the street in the U.S. subvance of the U.S. geospacacacaccount of NASA .
So , we 're now going to do something else .
This is actually actually the right right right to the web ; you can go to see .
It 's a project called the Photosynth , which combine two different technologies .
One is Seadragon and the other is a very interesting visual computer in the computer , a very interesting to do from Noah Snavely , a student of Washington , with the aid of Steve Seitz Rick Seitz Rick Seitz Rick Seitz . "
And it 's from the web , I 'm going to be a web .
You can see it when we do this kind of screens , where we can go from a picture to another picture and have this kind of experience to the last pair .
But the space of the space of the space here has actually a meaning .
The algorithms of the computer have recorded these images together , so that corresponresponse to places that corresponding to places that the report to the law of the South Roccious , you know , the sent of the Montagne Roccious , you see . Here you see that the elements of a demonstrstrate or imaging of the panish imaging of the spacecech , and these things are all the place .
I don 't know if I have time to show you some other environment .
And there are some of the most space .
I want to go directly to one of the original data of Noah-- and this prototypical previous , which we 've done to work for the first time we 've done to work for the first time . And that we 've done this first time -- to show you what I think is really the key key to be the chemical one . And it 's not necessarily about the web . It 's not necessarily observing that we 've been looking at the website .
We had to worry about the legal aspects and on it .
This is a reconstruction of Notototpractice of Notototpractice . Bast digititch of Notototpractice , and you get pictures of these things in magliet , other of the campus and on the saving of these argument is to discovering this model .
So I 'm all pictures of the Flickr and they were all connected to this way .
And it 's possible to be navigate in this way .
You know , I 'd never thought to go to work for Microsoft .
It 's very gratificing to get this kind of accooks here .
I think you can see that it 's a lot of different kinds of focus on the sorts of different focus on the phone , and the number of meaning , had a number of meaning , had this environment .
And if you can get out of the most strange .
Many are blown by doing , etc .
So , there 's a series of photographs -- it 's a series of photographs -- it .
This is a poster of Nototre Dame recorded .
We can go from the poster to the physical view of this environment .
The essential point is that we can do with social environmental environment . This is now taking data from the whole memory collective , from the internal point of how to be apping the land , from the visual point of view -- and connected all those those data .
All those pictures become connected together , the main of the parts .
You have a whole country of the whole land of the land .
Think about this as a prolunging of Stephen Lawler on Earth 's Earth .
It 's something that growing in complexity , as a lot of people use , and the people who are going to use it .
They are marcated with metadicated metadicated by other people .
If you know , somebody comes the idea of contrassigning all these sants , my name , my catchchchchchchchchchchemical requires of those data , and I can use as a point of those data , and I can use as a point of those data , and I can use it as a kind of a kind of a kind of of a kind of cross-out of a kind of of moon and cross-out of a kind of cross-out of use .
Of course , a consequence of everything are the virtual models of all the interesting part of every part of the land , collective time , it doesn 't just just just to live and similar images and similar pictures of it , but from the memory collective , but from the memory .
Thank you .
Chris Anderson : I realized well ? What you know , you know what your software is to be to do is that in the next years , all the photographs , all the photographs of the world , they share going to be practically connected together ?
BAA : Yeah . What 's doing it is doing in practice .
It 's creating hyperlink , if you want , you to see images .
And it 's doing it in the basis of the pictures .
The thing is become very interesting if you think about the wealth of information semanties that many of these images are going to be .
As when you do a research research on the web , you digit a frase and the text on the web has a lot of information about the web has a lot of information about the web picture .
Now , what happens if that picture is connected all your picture ?
So the amount of interconnection of semantic interconnection and the amount of weive is really really huge . It 's a classical classical classical classical .
CA : Blaise , it 's really incredible .
BAA : I thank you very much .
One of the main of the main of the suck of the suck of the sum of the sum of the world has no deal with anti-tradiers , between those who 's tradiers , between those who 's spent the past in the wind , the wind , you wind the stand of the plants .
Basti thinking about the Jaguar Jaguar travel again again beyond the Via Lattea , or that the Inuit 's still collished , or that in Himalaya , or that in Himalaya , or that in Himalaya , but to remember the world that the way we live in the world 's idea that we live in a sense , but it 's just a lot of reality , but it 's just a model of reality , it 's just a model ,
the consequence of a particular set of choices that our styres has done , well or bad , many generations ago .
And , of course , we all share the tracking tracks .
We all all have . We all do it .
We are subjects to start .
We have to deaking the inesorability of death , so we don 't surprise if we 're going to get and white --
We all have a art .
What it 's the particular rhythm of the song , the rithydropping of every culture .
It 's not not matter that there are the Thankers of the Borneo , or the Woman Haiti , or the Kaissites , or Kaisya , or the Kaisssetted , or a settle , or a camp in the Sahara .
He was my broadly my journey of a month ago , or a month ago , or a saving , or a saving of the world .
All these people are teaching us that there are other ways of existing ways to think , other ways of moving in the world .
And if you reflective , if you can give you a concept that can give you hope .
And then , the myriads of cultures of the world creating a spiritual life of spiritual and cultural life , which is important to the planet as the planet as the planet as the way the planet as the biosphere .
And you can think about this ragnospsphere , as a nine , and you can defining the etnosphere is the whole sum of all the concepts of all the concepts , and ideas , inspiration , and ideas , intuition , and ideas , intuition ,
The etnosphere is the fantastic pain of humanity .
It 's the symbl of what we are and what we can be in how inquisitive .
And it seas the biosphere was a gravingly consumed as it is success to the etnosphere and unfortunately much more quickly .
None biologist , for example , would say that 50 percent of all the species was or is the orgain of the exintion of the extract of because it 's faster , or the most apocalitten -- in the field of diversity -- and it 's not close to the hypocalitten diversity .
And it 's all that is , of course , the persent language .
When you 're nated 6,000 languages on this planet .
One language is not only to a lot of a grammatical rules of a lot of rules of rules .
One language is the language of the human spirit .
It 's the middle with which the animal of every culture comes in the world .
Every language is a forest of mind , a backin , a thought , a very clean ecosystem .
And of those 6,000 languages , while we are here in Monterey , at least the mety is not ssurrouned in the orchie of children .
They 're not teaching kids , the kids , which means , you know , not what it 's already already death .
What is there more trials of the sad of the silence , of the last to be the last to talk about a language , of not to get to the saggeel of the saggeity of the children ?
This was a few days of the world of somebody in the world in some of the world of every two weeks : every two weeks , and a double language with the ulsilabe and a old language .
And I know somebody 's going to say , " Did it 't it .
The world would not be a better place if you 're talking about all the same language ? " Well , then we talk all about yoruba . We talk to all yoruba .
We 're going to talk kogi .
You 're going to be a tract thing is that you can 't talk to you .
I 'd like to do you to do a journey through the etnosphere --
a little journey in the etnosphere to give you a source of what we 're losing .
Many of us deal that when I say , " different ways to existing , " I mean , it really is different ways of existing ways .
We make for example of this bimbo Barasana , in Amazony , the popular of anaconda , which crede at the myth of the sat of latest , which crede the midden of the sacond of the sacond of the sacond .
It 's a popular people that it 's not able to distinguess the blue color of the green falling fly in the forest , which dipend people .
They have a strange language and a matrial rules , he said , " You have to save a different language .
All of this has been radical in the past mitologist , but it 's in these families , in these families , in these families that you are or seven languages .
They are limitate to listen and then they begin to speak .
We take one of the most interesting tribes that I 've lived in the most interesting tribes that I 've been lived in the primarist of the Ecuador , an incredible popular people who had the prime in 1958 .
In 1957 , five missionarian account construct a mistaining mistaining .
They had been done by the photographs that they were reported to the photographs that they were reversus , to menty-dimensional forest .
They collected the picture of the land , they were going to be a search or a shape , and not find anything , they 'd conclude that it was the depping , and they killed the five missionary .
But the Waorans don 't kill the stream .
They killed them between them .
The 54 percent of the mortality was caused by them .
We are rised to eight generations and we found two cases of morning and when we 've been remaining to know that one of them was invectually invectually inveck , and then they 've been inveck , and then they killed the same .
The chatators were able to recognize the animal , 40 steps and recognizes the species .
In the first years , it was assigned a really interesting job when my professor , I was going to be a really interesting , when my professor wanted to go to Haiti to go to Haiti to the sgret of the potential of Duvalier and Tonton Macool , and I imposed to be able to do the zomeat .
So , I 'd be a miraolder , I 'd to be able to make the Vodoun and the Vodoo is not magnera .
It 's quite a complex view of a very complex mistaining .
So , many interesting .
If I ask you to tell me the big religions of the world , what would you say ?
Cristianesimum , Islam , Buddism , etc .
A continent is always left out , thinking that the sub-Saharan is not a lot of religious people . And instead is that the distillllabor is not the other that the distillside of these concepts in the tragic tragic tragic .
What makes the interesting voodoor is the intest interest between life and death .
So the rows are going to be hire the spirits .
The spirites can be invoced by the Grande Acqua , they replace to the dance of the dance and replace to the time to the soul of the vial , that for a short kind of a short acter .
So , for this voodoodoers . " You know , you go to speak to God .
We say , " We say , " We say , " God . "
And from the moment you 're having a bought that you guid , you can you like it , how can you do it ?
So you 'd be able to these incredible events : follow vote in the state of trance that touch toize the tizes are going to be a rather fort of the power of mind when it 's catalized in a state of extraordinary exchange .
You all have the most of the people I 've lived the most extraordinary Kogi of Sierra Nevada Santa Marta Mars , in the saving of the Santa Marta Marta ,
They were the ancient of the maintain of the maintain of the charge of the Colombia in the conquician , the popular sundamage , the popular sunununlike the vulan , which is the suncycle on the plants .
In a drumed continent . It 's never been conquisted by the spaged spaged by the spaged spaging .

There 's no space for these things in the palua , in the Aststops of the Tibet , but thank thank you to the time and the ritual , they created a mystics of the Earth is not about the whole neighborhood , but on a whole neighborhood , but on a whole thing that the Earth can only live from the Earth can only be a conscious , because it 's the human conscious .
What does it mean ?
It 's a little girl in the Ande of the Ande that grew up the mountain is a spirit of the Apu that 's a very different human being desteply and it will be a different human being desteply and it will have a different source with the mountain that the mountain a credyourself of the mountain of the mountain that a mountain a mountain of rock of the mountain .
That 's the dimour of a spirit or a mineral cuth is irrise .
What 's interesting is the metaphor that defines the export between the individual world and the natural world world .
I grew up in the forests of the Columbia Britannica credouble .
And this resist of a different human being from my friends Kwakiutl that the forests are the forests of Hukukuk and the ball here is the writers of the world , and the babs that live in the world , the spirits that we 're going to be in the Hamatsa .
If you start to look at that these cultures can create different , you can start to start with some sense of them , you can start to be able to be a lot of indeed .
I 've been taken this picture to aprile in the nordocccial Amazon .
Mayap , you 've heard of the ayahuk , the most powerful psycoactive , the most powerful psycoactive .
What makes it affected is the ayer of the ayahuk is not the potential of the place , but his elaboration . It 's composition . It 's composition . It 's composal .
From one side , this liana launch that you have a series of carboline , harm and harm , lifting and saving ,

This plants could be tripptamine , very similar to the serotonina , dimethyptamine , methyptamine .
If you 'll ever see Yanomami , you 'll see the nose that they do from a different kind of kind of kind of a different kind of ssorts of methoxydithoxtamine .
And I 'm going to be a little bit like the nose is a little bit like to be sparked by a carrier of dipinbars , and to the sea a of electricity . [ Risate not creates a distauring of the reality .
I was often with my professor , I was a lot of a professor , Richard Evan Shultes , the man who had been schedelic , with his discovery of the fungi of the fungi of the fungi in Mexico .
I 'm not going to classicipate these triptamine as the slower because if you 're not telling anybody to be hallucinated .
It 's possible to be able to be in the horally , if you can see the MAO .
Now it 's the nice : The Is that are in this liana are in this liana are inherself in this liana are income . The question of the same kind of necessary to be able to be a very much of the sorts of plants , like these people are in this , like these people are in this , they think , as you think about the bioochemical .
We use the great eufemiss of the prove and of the mistake , which can revehiced .
But if we say to the Indian , they 'll tell us " " " " " "
What does it mean ?
This is sought , the Cofan , has 17 variety of ayahuash , which distinguess in the forest , and that you can get into the same species .
If you ask how to stbilies their tasonomy , they 'll tell us " I thought about the rest of plants , of the rest of the rest of the rest of the respts of it . "
The solution is : you take the 17 variety of land-board and each one will sun and each other .
With this doesn 't have laurea in Harvard , but it 's much more interesting that you count the stage .
Now , [ [ applausi . The problem is that even the ones of us who have to heart heart heart people find out of the maining people in the margins , but in some way redots to the margins of the story of the world , and pass beyond .
In fact , the X-century , between 300 years , it will not remember for his innovation , but rather as the way the innovation of the world , but rather as the way we were stopped and we have to accepted or accepted , or accepted spent the destruction of diversity diversity and cultural the planet .
All the seual cultures through the seuuusually for new possibility of life .
And the problem is not the technology .
The Indian Sioux have no stopped to be Sioux when they put out out of the arch of the Americans don 't have been stopped by the herself .
It 's not the change or technology that are the income of the etnosphere . It 's the power .
The during the domination of domination .
And if you say , you 'll find that these are not cultures that these are not cultures of the world , you 'll see that these are not going to be .
They 're creatures and dinnamics spints out of the existence of hythy forces that will go beyond their ability to adaping .

You know , you 're going to reempiize the dream with the sywood .
Or , in Yanomami , are the disease that are coming with the purpose of the sorts of golden .
If we 're going to move on the Tibet , where I 'm doing many research , you 'll see the during the political domination .
As you know the genocide , the physician , it 's physical popular , but the indestruction of life , but the destruction of life , the stroying of life , not just a popular , but it 's not just a popular , but it 's a part of the development of a popular development .
And you can 't understand the suffering of the Tibet , because you don 't go from the beginning .
I 've been going to 6,000 miles from Christstststage through the Tibet , and I got to Lhasa young connection , but only come to Lhasa , but only came to Lhasa , but only came to Lhasa .
6,000 monuments re-up , in pols and cenables .
1.2 million people killed by military people in the Cultural Rivolution .

The pain of Tibet can be inherself , but the spirit of the popular .
At the fall , all you reduce to a choice .
We want to live in the world world in the monooony or we want to be the policy of diversity ?
The big anthropologists Mead , before he died that his largest was that , in our largest painting was that , in our own own way , we 'll see the whole gunning of human reduction . We 're not only seeing the whole gundyourality of thinking , but a day we 'll be a way to be .
And it 's a million people to remember that our species is existed for 60,000 years .
The Rivolution Neolitics , who gave us the agriculture , which has been able to fight the seed of the seme , replace the poem of the sad , which is creating the rowing of the saving of specialization , and we talk about 10,000 years ago .
modern world industry has been in 300 years .
That squaliight to me , we don 't suggests that we have the answers to all the challenges we have to reach in the millennia .
When these miriads of cultures of the world is asked what humans want to say to be human , they have different .
And it 's in these answers we all answers the chance of being what we are : a conscious species , which has to make all the people in the way that all the people and all the gyourself can fioring . And there are big moments of the gotten .
I 've been taken this picture on the northern extremely of the hanger of the white of the white white of white white , and this man , Olaya , and this man said , he told me the wonderful story of his grandfather .

For somebody 's home .
They 're doing severing severing the human imagination that answers are at the time . And for all of these children , like the dreams of our children , they become part of the swise of the willlessing of hope .
And to finish , we know in Geographic , we are convints that the politicians will never ever ever ever .
We think the polemies --
[ [ Applausi . They 're not persuasive , but we believe that the stories can change the world , and maybe we are the best institution to tell stories of the world . Every month of our own own .

So the saggeity of all the people can contribute to our well-being collective .
Thank you .
I 'm going to talk about some things I wrote in this book that I hope you 've already heard and proverse to the other that you 've already heard and proverse them .
I 'd like to start with what I call " " " dogma " . "
The dogma official dogma ?
The dogma official dogma , the Western official society , the official dogma , " If we want to massive the well-being of our citizens . " The way to do it is massive to do that is the freedom to do that . " The way to do that is to do that to do is a several . "
And the reason is , from a side , in the fact that the freedom is the same value , it 's ule to be a value , essential to be useful , essential to be a value ,
And the other is in fact that if we are libers , every one of us can act for all that this massive , which is , no one that we 're going to be , no one that nobody that decide in name .
The way to massive freedom is massive to massive choice .
More choices people are , more libs , and more more more or is their freedom , it 's the biggest , it is the weight .
This , I think , it 's so deeply roroadicated in society that nobody would be able to put it in the dube .
And it 's also deeply , it 's actually radiced in our lives .
I 'll show you some examples of what the progress has made possible .
This is my super--market . It 's not particularly big .
I lose a simple note on the conditions for inhimself .
In my super----unununconcers , without content 10 variety of the extrtruth , and 12 aceti white white white , you can buy for a huge number of conditions of conditions in the inct nobody of the 175 proning it 's a big degreep-of-of-of-of-of-of-of-of-granddwide .
That 's the super--market .
Then you go to the stereo of electronic electronic stereo : you know , the CD , radio , piac , the CD , the herself .
And in this single one rich is a big number of electronical components , there 's a big number of audio audio .
We can make six million different combinations of different combinations using the components that there are in a negoods .
You have to admit that there is a lot of choice .
Actus : the world of communications .
And once , when I was a kid , they could get all the telephone services , in pat the pat that were fornitable to the mom .
It was a phone , you didn 't buy it .
One of this consequence of this , between the other , it was that the phone .
These days are gone .
We have a variety of telephone , especially between the phone phone .
Here 's the phone phone phone .
My favorite is that in the middle , I read MP3 , tape of the nose , and the fort for the crash brulele .
If you don 't have the time in the sauce , you 're going to be a certain time .
And what happens to the end is that people are going to go into the negots and it 's the answer is . " No . "
It 's not possible to buy a cell phone that you don 't find .
So , in other aspects of life that are much more important than the acquify of the things are much more important than you .
Axblood blood : it 's not in the United States you go from the doctor and the doctor you have to do .
Instead , I go to the doctor , and the doctor says , " OK , we could be .
You know , " Dootore , what should I do I do you do ? "
And the doctor says , " A has these benefits and these answering sets and and B has these benefits and these answering . "
" What do you want to do ? "
And you rebits , " Dotor if she was me , what would you do ? "
And the doctor , I 'm not . "
The result of the result of the maled of maled , " expression that makes it look like a beautiful thing .
But it 's not that you can see the fish and responsibility to make decisions from somebody who knowledge , observing the doctor , to something that doesn 't know -- and so , it 's not -- and so it 's not -- and so it 's not that you 're going to be a ideal condition to be able to make the patient .
There 's a huge marketing of products , you know , you know , you know , if you think it doesn 't have any sense , given that we can 't buy them .
But if we don 't understand them , because there are public ?
The answer is that they want to be in the morning we call the doctor to be able to ask the ret .
What is the fundamental as our identity is a question of choice , as you see in this view , as you see in this vignel , " Don 't want to forcing children . It 's not to be able to be a moment , " We need to invent the right .
And we can reinvent how many times we can do it .
The one is that every morning , at the answers , you need to decide that kind of person want to be .
I 'm going to spend the family and the matriage , a time the common , smart for anybody , it was that there was a longer as possible , and he was going to start the more possible .
The only one versus it with who , not when , and it was not when you know what do after .
And so , all of it 's really to play .
I 'm going to be intelligent students , and I do 20 percent of the work of the time .
And it 's not because it 's not because it 's not because they are diligent .
but I 'm impensierites , I mean , I would you say , " I would you say , " I should I do it now ? "
" Do I would you know about the time ? I think before I was the career ? "
They 're interrogatives .
And they 're trying to answer these questions , even if this implment is not to be able to be able to be able to be a beautiful vote to my examples .
And they have to do that . They are important questions .
Now , the work : We are lucky , like Carl sound , because technology allows us to work every day , from the corner of every day , from the world , transpent that Hotel Randolph .
And I 'm talking about , there 's a angoline , and I didn 't tell anybody , where the WiFi works .
I don 't know , because I want to use it .
What does that mean , this incredible liberty of choice we have to do it , it 's going to continue , if we have to work or not .
We can go to see our son player , with the cell phone in a cell phone , the Blackberry in the other , and the notebook , and the notebook , and the notebook , and the noteach .
And even if I 'm all spent , every minute that we see our son , we 're also asked , " I 'm going to answer this called ? "
" I have to answer this email ? I had to answer this literally ?
And even when the answer is " no , all this makes the experience of your son very different parts from what it would be in other conditions .
So , you know , the little things and big things , big , things and big , things and life , life is a question of choices .
And once the world was this : Ovreal , there were some chance , but it wasn 't a question of choice .
The world today is a better than this : The dilemma is , " It 's a positive thing , or negative ? "
The answer is South .
The positive lated things we know , so I 'll talk about the negatives .
All this choice compories two of the negatives of people .
The first , paradoxtisally , it 's produced paradox .
With many options of the way , which I 'm going to get very difficult to do it .
I offer an example of meaning , a conduct study of fly flying .
A whole connected to the data of the Vand , the gigantesh society , with about a million clients of a source of clients .
What she discovered is that for every 10 solutions that are offer in more , the percentual percentual adesion , two percent .
With 50 source , there is 10 percent in less than adesions than you have available to the respect when they have only five . Why ?
Because with 50 source of the four-source , it 's maledgely difficult to decide , and the choice is remaining .
And I 'd be tomorrow , and again , I 'd ask , I 'd be obviously support .
You don 't just mean that these work from old old old , they 're not just going to be enough money , because it doesn 't have enough money , even though it 's so ostics that allow the source of work .
I don 't talk about , they 're losing until five dollars for year from the datest dator of work , which would be a real deep-green dispoining .
So the paralis a consequence of you have a lot of choices .
And I think it makes the world .
" And to finish , for the eternity : ketchup , sens or maionese ? "
You 're just taking the right decision , if it 's for the right decision , if it 's for the eternity , right ?
You don 't want to choose the wrong wrong , and you know , it 's the wrong condition .
So this is the first effect . The second is that we can also have to avooid , and we 're less sodddisdisappears , we were at least as we were being in with less options .
And this is a different reasons .
One of these is that with many conditions of the way you wish , if you buy one and it 's not perfect , it 's easy to imagine that you could have a fun that it would be better . And what happens is that the alternative , and that 's what 's happening is that the alternative argument of the soft replacement of the sounds that I 'm going to be a fresult of the present decision of the sounds that you could have the recognize the soon of the the soon the present decision of the resdent .
And even when it was a good decision .
There are more choices . There are , more easy displeased any details that it 's unsubsional ,
And then , there 's what economists call it expensive .
Dan Gilbert has closed very well , as the value that we 're going to be the value to things that we 're confront .
So , when there are a lot of options , it 's easy to represent the characteristic active active active active and be less sodden in the option of that you are choice .
Here 's a example . I 've been in New York .
But it 's probably thought .
There 's this pyour-bull .
A place of lussian .
It 's saming . Ottma . It 's day day day . It 's all for them .
Not it 's not . But what he thinks is , " Well , maldaily , it 's Agotten . "
" All my neighborhood Manhattan is . "
" I could talk about it right in front of the house . "
And then two weeks of them , the idea that it 's loss -- every day -- every day -- the chance of parking where you want .
The exist opportunity to be the soddisfation for what we have , even when the choice was .
And the most of the options we have to look , more the characteristics .
Here 's another example .
This is a lot of things .
It 's about the time , and perhaps in the time , and perhaps in the time .
But the most important point is that anything you choose , you wouldn 't do the other .
The things that we don 't get a lot of active active active , that can make less attractive what we do .
And third point : It 's the growth of expectations .
I tried to my skin buy buy a new jeans .
It 's almost always jeans .
And once the jeans were just a lot of time , they were just like , and they were discovered by besty , only after they were discovered , just after I was going to go well .
So , I went to buy a couple new when the old old old were going , and I said , " I need a couple jeans , this is my cut . "
The commit to me , " Look , and it 's going to do it , and it ? "
He wants to be with the cernist of the bottons ? " Stonebottons ? "
" Look ? "
" Seight them to the bi or ? Bbla bla -- " Continuit to eless .
I was sbalorger , and after a little bit of it . I 'm going to say , " I want the guy that was the only guy , so for a time , so for a time , so for a time I tried to all the same jeans , and then used from the smart , and I 'm going to use the best jeans that I had ever had been .
It was the massive . I got all that choice was better .
But I feel worse .
Why ? I wrote a whole book for understood .
The reason I was worse I was worse with all that choice of my waiting for that I was very much about it .
I was expected to me . I didn 't expect it for anything that I was just about anything that was just a kind of , but when you live 100 different , steps , at least a kind of had to be perfect .
What I had to get a good thing , but it doesn 't perfect .
After you have to have a choice with what I was trying to sssatic .
The add of options in life doesn 't do that they want to increasing the expectations of the options of the same options .
And this will be a sdisfation , even when the results are good .
None in the world of marketing if you realize .
Because if they knew , you 're not knows what I 'm talking about .
The truth is the most of this .
" It was better when you was worse when it was worse when it was worse when it was worse when it was worse , when it was still possible to meet of surprise .
Or in the world we live -- in the world that we live -- opulents , industry , industry with the massive fe-fe-like , the massive that we can hope is that things to the altheist .
You 'll never be surprised because your expectations , because your expectations , I 'm saving .
The secret of happiness -- that you 're here -- it 's , " Well , you want . "
I mean , a little white time -- I 'm really really saved and my wife is really study and my wife is really study .
I couldn 't do better , I couldn 't do , I 'm not going to be .
But it 's not always a good thing .
And finally , a consequence of the buy of jeans is that when there 's just that guy 's when you 're not satic , and you know , " Why ? "
" Who is responsible ? " " " " the answer is clean .
The world is the world is the responsible . What can I do you do ?
When there are hundred of types of jeans , and you buy a satic insoddisfacy , and you ask the clear , it 's the clear that the responsible you .
You could have better .
With hundreds of variety of variety of variety of variety of variety of variety .
So when people take decisions , even if the result is saving , you feel saving , and they 're saving up to them .
In the last years , the depression is explose in the world industry .
I think a meaning factor -- not the only one , but important -- of this onto depression is that people have experiences of the people experiences .
And when they have to explain this situation that the colse is they think that the cold is .
So the final result is that in general , we 're better , but we feel better , but we feel worse .
Let me remember .
This is the official dogma , what we all take for good and it 's completely fly . It 's not true .
There 's no doubt that a little bit better than you don 't have it to be better than you know , but it 's not going to be a little bit better than a little bit .
There 's a critical value , magic . I don 't know what .
But I 'm enough to be a piece of a piece of the level that we 've been choices to our life .
Now , from the political point -- I 've been finished -- I 'm a way of political view , the nocccil is the follow .
What it allow all this is the wealth of the industry is the wealth of material .
There are many places in the world , and you know , you know , where the problem is not that they find out of choice .
The problem is that there are too a lot of points .
So the way I 'm talking about is a maling maling is a malesclusive of modern , remarkable society .
And what it does to depress and array is this : Steve Levitt . He talked about it as those expensive and discoveries ways to be inuseful . It 's a spreco of money . It 's a sprek of money .
I mean these choices , complicated and available , it 's not that they 're just inuseful .
They 're going to be deleterie .
They 're worse .
If a little bit of what in our society is alone of the time , it was reversed in those where people has too much much better , it would not just be able to be able to better , but also .
This is what economists call a mists called a a paretian .
A redistributtion of the remaining of all -- not just to poverty -- because of this choice in excess that we get up .
So , you can get out of what you want to be all what you want to --
You know , people of culture , you think , " But what does it create that fish ? "
" It 's obvious you can 't get anything in a wind . "
" A remarkable imagination , a limited limited vision of the world -- "
and I 'm interpret to the whole thing , at the beginning .
But then , I think , instead , instead , I realized that that it 's the long way .
Because the reality of the way is that if you managed the bocet , so that 's all possible to be possible . " You can 't get the freedom . You get the paralysis .
If you 're break the bocet in a way that all dive possible dimines the soddisfation .
You can see the paralysis , and you reduced the weless .
They all need a sphere .
This is almost certain too , you know , perhaps even for the fish , and it 's supply for us .
But it 's no symbolic symbolic sset for infelity and , I 'm going to be a recil for the infants .
Thank you very much .
