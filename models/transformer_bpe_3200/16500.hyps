The last year I showed these slide slide to show that the glacial calottical calculation , which is almost three million years had the size of the 48 continental .
But it 's a lot of the gravity of the problem because it doesn 't show the spent of the ice .
The artical caloth is , in a certain sense , the puls-global cumate system .
It 's winvernice and retired of the summer .
The next slide is going to be a rapid carrelated to the advent of the last 25 years .
The ice perenses are signed in red .
You see , they 're going to get the blue wall .
That 's the ice in the winter , which is ritired by extent .
You can see that the pace ice perenne , of five years or more , is like blood , which is like blood , which is the body .
In 25 years , it 's gone from so ,
This is a problem because the heat the full of the ice ice ice ice , where the ice is huge amounts of carbon that , where there are huge amounts of fuon the cycle , they get into the microbes .
It 's about the totality of the inquination of global warming , the amount of of global warming could doubt , that could doubt , overcome this point .
In some lagey profound in Alaska a meter is already rebolling from water .
The professor Katey Walter University of Alaska is a team of a team in the pressed , a team of a lake , the last inveral .
Video : Wow ! Al Gore : Look . It 's good . The question is if we 're going to be .
It 's the reason that this termal screamong the Groenland from the northern .
This is a glacial record .
The landed had never reached to the livelion .
This is the Kangerlussuaq , in the west of the Groenland .
If you want to know how the sat the sea level for the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice .
These are running out very quickly .
Another part of the planet : Antartide , the biggest block of the planet .
The last month scientists have dichied that the bills of the ice is in the negative , and that the Western Antarctica , which pogy on some hyth-Suncket , is particularly quickly , in the skin of the leaving leaving .
It 's six feet feet of the land-level , like in Groenland .
The Himalaya , the third largest block , you see new lagey , which is a few years ago .
40 percent of the world population is going to get a potail of the potail .
Sulle Ande : this glacier is the source of the potail of this city .
The luck is increased .
But when it gets up , the same happens to the potail water .
In California , the nenow , the Sierra Nevada is 40 percent .
The idrices are in crisis .
The predictions , like you read , are good .
The growth of secustomer in the world leads to a remarkable remarkable .
The environmental disasters are increasing a round outside and without precedenting .
Four times more numbers in the last 30 years , I respect 75 .
This is a whole insustainable .
If you look at the historic context if you can see the consequences .
In the last five years , we added 70 million tons of CO2 every 24 hours -- 25 million tons of the ocean every day .
Look at the time of the East Pacific , from the Next , to the waste of the substent of the substent of the background of the oxygen in the ocean .
The major causes global warming , together to the deforestation , which is 20 percent , is the use of fossil fuels .
On the oil is a problem , and the fuel is even worse .
The United States are one of the two countries with more emissions , together to China .
And it was proposing to build a lot of other carbon fuon carbon .
But we 're seeing a direction of a direction .
These are the anullated projects in the last few years and some green propointer of the verage .
So , there 's a political lost in our country .
The fuel industry and the oil have spent 250 million dollars in the last year to promote carbon , which is a oxide .
That 's the picture I would remember something --
SS , in Tennessee , where I saw , there was a 3.8 billion liguns of fuel .
Maybe you saw it on the news .
This is the second biggest fllow in in America .
It 's happened around Natale .
The nalien ads of one of the fuel industry was this .
Video : It 's got the fuel of the fuel is a kind of allegro and happy .
It 's abundent here in America , and it 's growing our economy .
From carbon is more clean .
It 's good price , adorable and the work is that they 're going to keep it .
Al Gore : From here is a lot of the West Virginia .
The biggest mineral society on the mountains is Massey Coal . This is his administrator .
Video : Don Blakenship : I 'm going to be clear -- Al Gore , Nancy Peloid -- they don 't know what they 're talking about .
Al Gore : So the Alleance for the Protext of Clima has two campaign .
This is a part of them , a part .
Video : Acore : Acore COALergy : Acket .
So , our priority is to invest a lot of money in a bunch of money in a bunch foreign , and it confused the truth .
In fact , the fuon is not sporite .
We think it 's clean -- it 's also a good profuels .
So it doesn 't preocumthical change .
Let 's go to us .
Video : Acore : Carbone , you 've heard a lot of it .
So let 's take a turn into a structure to the avaning of the pulit of the pulit .
Stranspordinary ! The machines are a little rumor , but this is the sound of the pulit technology .
The fuel consumption is between the major ckets of global warming , but the technology of the pulit that you see changes everything .
Do a look at : this is the odiergn technology .
Al Gore : Infinally , the positive alternative , the positive alternational security .
Video : The National security is in crime ; the climate security , the climate crisis .
The river that connects all : our depenpenpencil from fossil fuels , as the pace fuel and oil is important .
Now , there 's a new , audace , audace solution for the circumstoms .
Rpower : 100 percent of clean energy , in 10 years .
A to remention the work , to make sure more sure , and help to stop the global warming .
Finally , a solution that we can solve our problems .
Repower . Scoprite more .
Al Gore : This is the last one .
Video : How about return to America .
One of the fastest ways of enjoying the independence of the combustible that killing our planet .
So , the future is here . I 'm going to , a new energy network .
Nures two : Nuoves investment for bunch for bunch .
Nothing : Repower . It 's time to be realists .
Al Gore : A old proverbio says , " If you want to go fast , you go to the fix .
If you want to go away , you go back together . "
We have to go away , quickly .
Thank you very much .
The last year at TED , I 've got a introduction on the LHC .
And promise to enjoying to enjoying it on how the machine works .
So , I think the other time . And for those that the other time there were , the biggest scientific experiment ever trip -- 27 miles of a circles of the consciousness .
Her task is to reduce the conditions that were at less than a billion second from the beginning of the universe -- until 600 million times a second .
All that 's just unambiitious .
This is the Ginevra .
We push these min-Big Bang in the relevant .
This is what I work . It 's called ATLATLATLAS -- it 's about 22 feet .
This is a spectacular picture of ATLATLATLAS in building this .
Ten settember of the last year , we acceso the machine for the first time .
And this picture was taken from ATLATLAS .
It was because of the foreigation in the control of control .
It 's a picture of the first of the particles that had done all the LHC , entking in collision , by a part of HC , and a part of the HC Loning particle into the relevator .
In other words , when we see that , we see that , 10 to settember , we knew that the machine was a great writing .
I don 't know if it was this to do that , when somebody went on on Google and I saw that the pages that the beginning was this .
That means we had a cultural impact beyond .
About a week later , there was a problem with the machine , and just these files here -- these figored bysleep .
These are 13,000 print when the machine works when the machine works .
Now , the technical technical between you will look at the files and say , " It 's not true . They are too overwhom too . "
And they can do that because when they 're very cool cosiddets are overconstructing overlauthors .
So , at least 271 degrees , at a temperature in the space between the space , these things can bring that the current .
In one of the giuntures between the magneti magneti magneti in the LHC , there was a phabbrication ,
So the file is going to give up slide , and the 13,000 amping improvised a electrical resistance .
This was the result .
Now , this is even more impressive if you think that these magneti fish more than 20 tons , and that 's been mostly about 30 centimeters .
They are damage about 50 magneti magneti .
We had to take them , what we did .
We represent them and enaged .
They are recently return all to their subscscape .
By the end of the LHC is going to be again integral .
We 'll access it , and we expect to get data and the right data , and continuing so our adventure to find out what the morning is the universe is .
Now , of course , in a certain way , these accidents return the debate on the value of science and engineering in the front of science and engineering in the front of science and engineering .
I think the fact that it 's so hard , the fact of going to go beyond the limitations of things like LHC .
I want to end with the words of a English scientist , Humphrey Davy David , which , I imagine , in difetc , his pupille was Michael Faraday , his pupille was Michael Faraday , said , " Nient is a very dangerous for the progress of the human mind how the idea of science is definal , that 's the definitely un-properly , our tribed to be . "
Thank you .
I want to start asking you to start thinking about when , children , from children , play cow up the morning .
And as you can get them and take them , and take them , and get them to get them and move them , learn to think and solve it 's really a lot of the relationship .
The space is deeply connected to the way we understand a lot of the world around us .
So , from the inspired use of the use of the physical interaction with physical objects , together to my consulent Packs , and my collaborator Jeevan Kalanithi , I started asking a computer , instead of having the mouse , but we use a computer , instead of having the mouse , we could trust a desktop of the mouse , we could trust a bunch of a desktop of the mand , we could truly deal with a bunch of mand ,
and how do it ?
The question was so interesting that we decided to explore the answer , building Siftable .
In a few words , a Siftable computer is a great computer interactive as a biscoscoscoscoscoscoscoscoscoscoscoscoscoscoscoscoscoscoscoscopet .
In a few words , a Siftable computer is a great computer interactive as a biscoscoscoscoscoscoscoscoscoscoscoscoscoscoscoscoscoscoscoscopet .
You can move with the hand , they can see , " between them , " to them , " to hear the movement and they have a screen and a radio wireless .
But most importantly , are physical objects , as the morning , can move to simply in the morning , can move .
The Siftable is an example of a new ecosystem to manipulate the digital information .
And as they get more physical , conscientists , and other , and as they get more physical , and as they get more physical , conscientists , of how we move them , we can explore more and extra new interaction .
I 'm going to start with some simple example .
This Siftable is configured to show the video : if you 're going to put it into a direction , the video will road from the other towards .
These reactive . These interactive is conscious about other .
If you deal with them , they 're interested in what they 're going to .
If they 're surrounds , they can do it a little bit .
If they 're surrounds , they can do it a little bit .
They also have their movement and inclination .
We then realized that one of the most interesting implications of the interaction was that we can use communal to the data , to the question , " a color like it was a liquid .
In this case , we have three Siftable configured as a grenice and I can use them to the color in the central , where they missing .
and I can use it to the color in the central , where they missing .
We can put too much , we can put a little bit of place .
There are also beautiful possibility of apprentice , like language , the mathematics and games where people can try to try things very quickly , and see it 's very quickly .
I 'm --
This is a Fibonacks that I do with a equations of equations .
Here we have a game of words that 's in half of the Scarabeo and Boble .
Pratically , at every turnal turnal , at any Siftable , Pratically , at every turnal turnal turn-up , at any Siftable , and as you know , he 's trying to understand him on a dictionary .
Then , about 30 seconds , they 're going to remix , and you have a new land-chance and new chance to try .
Thank you .
Here we 've got the kids came to the Media Lab , I did it so that I tried them and I got a video .
They are pleased .
And one of the interesting things about this kind of application is that you don 't have to give people a lot of education .
You just say , " Compons of words , and they know exactly what to do .
Here 's other people who try it .
This is our becomes younger , there on the right .
It was actually wanted to do it .
They are just in the morning , for him .
Now , this is a application of a interactive carton .
We wanted to build a tool for the apprentice of the Lui is Felix .
It can put new characters in the scene , by sold .
It can put new characters in the scene , by sold .
Here 's doing the sun .
Video : The sun is ssource .
David Merrill : Now she 's now a herself in the scene .
Video : The treat the time .
Bel work ! Yeah !
So , you get the Siftable and closer can make the characters --
Video : Bau !
-- by inventing your story .
Video : Hi !
DM : It 's a very open story with the open , and it can decide how you get to do .
DM : It 's a very open story with the open , and it can decide how you get to do .
Video : First , right .
DM : The last example I have time to show you is a tool , and I 'm going to show you a tool and exection and exectually executive music .
It 's a tool , recently , to the camp and to the music .
The Siftable here are aging from the bottom and bacterial .
Oach of these has four different variations , and you can choose what to use .
You can also put these sound in a sequence from understanding your pleasure .
And it 's just to do touch a sound and a sequence . "
These are actually actually able that you can control from the vial , like the riverber and the filter .
The attacks to a particular , and then inclens to enjoit .
And then there are the general effects like time and volume , which is applied to the sequence .
We look like it works .
Video : We 'll start making a base in two Siftable sequence , " We 're going to be a series , we add , we add , add , we add the other base .
Now I put a basis of the bottom line .
Video : DM : Now , I add perceive
Video : And now I 'm going to put the filter to the bacteria , so I can control the effect from the vial .
Video : I can fast the internal sequence of the way , or the other hand , or on the other .
Video : And now I 'm going to add the bottom of the bottom to give more expression .
Video : I can recombine the sequence to the flap .
So I don 't have to do it before , but I can improvisit , and make the longer or corta .
And now , finally , I can spread the whole sequence of the left Siftable to the Siftable .
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is to build new mountain machine , and more sounds like our brain and a body .
And today , I had time to show you one of the results of this path , and even some possibility that we try to bring from the lab .
The concept I want to put you is that 's coming from the new design of objects to interact with digital media , which will bring information in our world in the way that we want .
Thank you very much .
I don 't see the time I 'm not going to talk to all of you .
They 're a writer .
I 'm going to get books is my profession , but of course .
It 's also the love and the fashion and the fashion of my life .
And I don 't expect that it can change .
But , I said , something particular is recently in my life and in my career , which has me to report my own life , which has to me to report the entire relationship with this work .
The particular thing is that I recently wrote this book , this biography called " Mangia , Prega , Ama , " which , diversity from my precedented books , for some reason used in the world and became a great feelational , bestler , bestler , bestler , bestler ,
And the result is that everywhere is now , people treat how if I was convicted .
It 's true -- convicvictims .
They 're going to get all worried and say , " You don 't do that . You don 't do it better ?
You don 't have fear to keep writing for all life without being able to create a book that can important ? "
that can important to somebody ? "
It 's rassurance , you know .
But it could go worse , at the end of the one I remember that more about 20 years ago , when I started to say to people -- I was a writing .
I 'd put up to the same reaction from the fear .
And people said , " Don 't you get to me to have success ?
Do you don 't have fear that the launch of kill you ?
You don 't have fear to do this mestior for all of life without anything about it . And you 're going to die on a dreams of the wheel of the lower , and you know , the mos-forward to the mos-to-a-shelter . "
So , you know .
The answer -- the short answer to all these questions is , " Yes . "
And I fear of all of those things .
I always had fear .
And I also fear of many other things that people can 't inguess .
As the algae and other things .
But , as it 's about the writing what I thought and I 'd ask me last is why ?
Is it rational ?
It 's logical that anyone who has to expect to be spent from a work that 's been born to do .
But what is that 's so particularly in the impression of it is about mental health mental .
How my father , for example , he was a chemist engineer and I don 't remember one time in his 40 years of activity that he asked if he was asked if he was a fear to be engineer ?
There was never -- that blogging the bloggers of John , how does it go ?
Don 't it work like that , do you ?
Onestly , the chemistry engineers like a group have not certainly , in the centuries , warmful reputation of being alcolized manipulate to the depressive .
We writers , we have enough to this reputation , and not just writers , but creative of any kind of a reputation of being huge instable .
And it 's not to see that the triad of the magnifits of the magnifments of the magnifetc , only in the 2st century , they die young and often for them .
And even the ones that don 't have sound to be really dismade from their dons .
Nortman Mailer , before I die , in the last interview said , " Every little more " than an extraordinary of an extraordinary affermony about the work of their life .
But we don 't get the top of the way we hear that because we 've heard these things so long that somehow we completely have interiorized and accepted the notion that creativity and suffering are some way , and the art , at the end , and it will always get to the angoal .
And the question I want to take all of this idea ?
It 's all of this thing -- because even watching it from a centimeter of a distance to me .
I think it 's odious .
And I think it 's dangerous and I don 't want to see the perpetuated in the next century .
I think it 's better encourage our great minds of creative to live .
And I certainly know , in my case -- in my situation -- it would be very dangerous to start with that I 'm dark of the surrounding of the circumstances that are in my career .
It 's really -- you look at , I 'm pretty young , I have about 40 years .
I 've still about four decades of work in me .
And it 's very likely that anything I 'm going to be right now right now , it 's going to be right now , as the work that was going to be judged in my last book .
I 'm going to be slavery , because we 're all more or less friends here -- it 's likely that my great success is to my spent .
Oh , Gesus , that thought !
You know , that 's the kind of thinking that leads a person to start to bing the nine of the morning and I don 't want to do that .
I would like to keep doing this work .
So , the question is that ?
And so it looks like , after a lot of reflection , the way to do to keep writing is to create a psychological constructed , right ?
I have to find a distance of security between me , which I 'm writing , and my natural anxxiety that will be going to get up and , as I was trying to get it up to the time , looking for the time , to try to find other society to see if they could have some of the best ideas to see if they could have better ideas and more sane and more sane and more sane .
how to help people believe the creative creative inerent emotional risks of creativity .
And that research has taken me to the Greek and ancient Rome .
Seguites because I 'm given in my eye and then back .
In the Greek Greek and ancient people don 't seem to believe that creativity was in the men , OK ?
It thought that creativity was this spirit , and they were in the windness of a few distant surprising and unknown , for the distant reasons and unknown , for distant reasons and unknown .
The greatest divins called these spirites of creativity " demons . "
You look , wonderful , wonderful , he believed to have a demon that 's wisdom to get away .
The Roands were the same idea , but they called the the kind of spirit .
That 's great , because Roands didn 't think that a genius was a genius was a genius was a genius .
They think that a genius was this kind of devin which was living in a muri of a study artist 's study of a artist , a little like the elpho Dobby , and that came out to the work of the artist and the result of the artist work and modeled the result of that work .
Here 's the same -- this is the distance of which is the distance of which is that the psychological constructed that results from your work .
And everybody knew that was what it was so that it was , right ?
So the anti-artists were protected to certain things , like , for example , the too much arcible , no ?
If your work was exceptional , you couldn 't take all the desck , all of you knew that 's been helped by this genius .
If your work failed , it wasn 't your work , right ?
Everybody knew that was your genius to be a inable .
And so the people han conceived creativity in Occcuting for a long time .
And then the Rinasure came and all of this great idea ; we put the human being in the middle of the universe over all the mysteries and the mysteries and without any any any of leaving space creatures that writing from the winity .
This was the prinction of the rational remarkable , and people started thinking that creativity came from completely ililikely .
And for the first time in history , you get to this or that artist as a genius rather than a genius , like a genius rather than a genius .
And I have to say , I think that was a great mistake .
I think it allow somebody , a simple person to believe that they 're like a reciplent of being a reciplent , the essence and the source of all the mysteries , creative , unknown and eths a responsibility , and unknowable and the whield of the fragile .
It 's like to ask somebody to enjoy the sun .
Deform and destores completely the ego and creates all these tional ingestablished expanation .
And I think it was this pressure to have destruction of the artists in the passed 500 years .
And , if that 's true , and I think that 's the question becomes , and now ?
Can we do that .
Maybe I 'll go back to a more advantical understanding of the relationship between human relationship and mystery .
Or maybe not .
Maybe we can 't cell 500 years of rational thinking in a 18 minutes .
And probably people are in the public that would be legitimate sospherent , the idea of the notion , you know that they follow the people to stay in the next projects .
It 's probably not convince you all about this thing .
But the question I 'd like to ask is -- why not ?
Why don 't I think that way ?
Because it has more sense of anything that I 've ever heard to explain the imprevebility of the creative process .
One process that , as anyone who has been trying to do something -- so , basically , all here -- you know , you don 't get rationally .
And , in fact , it can sometimes seem completely paranormal .
I did this income against recently with the extraordinary Ruth Stone , who has 90 years , but that 's a poeter for all of life and said that during his childhood in the rural Virginia , working out in the camps , and he felt it , within if a pox , when a poetion the landscape .
He said that it was like a fragy of air .
And that was reaching to her from the landscape .
He felt that I got to get to get the land under his feet .
He knew I had one thing to do to that point and was of , words , " to do a matta . "
And so he 's going to correct home and it was going to be a little bit of a card and a little bit pretty quickly from a card and a math , and a math , and it was retable to the page .
Or I couldn 't get enough enough to be fast , so he 's going and correcrecent and the correct and the poem and the poetry roolating through and she loved and her lost and she would continue to round the landscape , looking for a poet . "
Then there were those times -- this piece of the piece I 'm going to say -- there were some moments where almost losing , right ?
So , he was running home and he was looking at the card and the poem was going through , and then he was a matched in the time , and then he said , that it was how if you hallat the hold and the office and he was doing it .
It was a poetry from the coda and the remain in his body and the spent on the page .
And in these cases , the poetry would be presented on the perfect page and intact , but the last word to the first .
So when I felt thinking -- it 's crazy , it 's exactly the equal to my creative process .
Not all my creative process -- they 're not a construction .
I 'm a mulo , and my way to work is ; you get up to the same orary every day and play and get and I 'm going to get up and I 'm going to get up on the goffly .
But even I , in my testing aggin , I 've striped against that thing , sometimes .
And I think that even a lot of you the han .
You know , even if the work and ideas came to me from a certain source , you can 't know .
And what is this ?
And how can we relative to it in a way that we don 't lose my head , but rather , what do you do we get to be sleep ?
As a lot of about , the best example , I have the best example I have is the Tom Waits , which I 've interviewed different years ago for a day .
We were talking about this , and you know , Tom , for the majority of life was the incarnation of the artist tomented contemporary , looking for trying to control , dominating , dominating , dominating these species of impults .
But then I 'm going to get up , and one day as he was driving on a highway in Los Angeles , changed all for him .
He was going to be fast and all of a tract with a melodia , which is in his head as it makes his head like inspiration , and the halleptant , and the wants , and the desider , and the desider , but it doesn 't know how to take it .
It 's not a piece of card , it 's not a math , it 's not a math registrator .
So I started to hear this species of old old old old , " I 'm going to lose , and I 'm going to lose , and I 'm going to get obsessed by this song .
I 'm not good enough and I can 't do it . "
And instead of going to stop .
I 'm going to put the whole mental process and made something completely new .
I just just just the sky and said , " Scuses , I 'm not driving ? "
" You look like that can write a song now ?
If you really want to exists , back in a moment , when I can take me a lot of you .
Or you go to importantly qualcaving something else today .
You 're going to disturbing Leonard Cohen . "
And his process changed after this .
Not the work , the work was still dark like .
But the process , and the fish anxiety that was require when the genius , the genius that was a genius of him , the genius that was out of him , and he was going to go back from where , realizing that he didn 't have to be a whole iorized thing and tormented .
but you get this peculiar , wonderful bizarre , wonderful bizarre , and this strange and this strange and external thing that it was not Tom .
So how the thing that story is to change a little bit even the way I was working and I 'd already save me .
This idea , I 'd save me when I was writing " Mangia , Prega , Ama , " and fall in one of those cave of the disperation where we 're working on something and we can 't start working on something and I can 't start working on something and I 've never written .
Not just bad , right , the worst book written .
And I started thinking about this project .
But then I remember Tom that I talked about Tom , and I tried to the air and I tried .
So I raised my face on the sleep and I was made my face to a vacuum of the room .
And I said to the end , " Sents , what , you 're both going to be brilliant is not going to be brilliant hit , no ?
Because as I see I 'm putting all I have , I don 't have this .
So if you want it to be better , you have to show you and do your part .
Okay . But if you don 't do it , you know what , I don 't do it .
I 'm going to write the same because it 's my work .
And I 'd like to favor that was recorded that I 'm presented to do my part of " Because -- finally , it 's so , OK -- -- centuries ago in the North Africa of the North Africa of the sacra , the music and sacred and music that was going on and hand-a-to-hand-forward and hours to the alba .
And they were always magnifer because the ballerins were professionals and were great .
But every long , rarely , something happened , and one of these artists had become a transcendent .
And I know what you know is talking about , because I know you 've all seen , a perforformance .
It was like if the time , and the ballerself walked through a land-up , and it was doing anything different from the solor , like 1,000 night , and it was all all of it .
And at the suddenly not appearance as a human .
But it 's accentirely from the divinity of the divinity .
And when this happened , when he was , the people knew what was , they called it .
They gave the hands and they were starting to dotar , " Allah , Allah , God , God , " God , God , "
That 's God , you know .
I urious note historic -- when the Morinvaded the Spain , I was this abitude with them and the pronounced by " Allah , " " " " " " " " Ole , " , " which you can still feel in the corride or in the flamp .
In Spain , when a artist did something impossible and magic , " Allah , " Alah , " Alah , " Well , I was a little bit of God .
And it 's great because we need .
But , the problem comes the day after , for the dancer , when you wake and discover that are 11 in the morning in Martedday and the morning of God is no longer .
It 's just a mortal with a gran bad bad , and maybe they can never get more to get to that altitude .
And maybe nobody will be the name of God still as yellow , and what do you have to do with the rest of his life ?
It 's hard .
This is one of the most painful recognizations to make a creative life .
But maybe it doesn 't have to be so angoal if you can 't believe , and you can 't believe , the most extraordinary aspects of your being from yourself .
But you might just believe that they 're being data in prested by an inimaginable source of this team that you have to go to somebody else .
And , you know , if we think that 's all changes .
And so I started thinking about it , and it 's sure how I thought about it for different months in the work of the book that I 'm going to remarkable , the dangerous , attesissively , attesissues , attesissues , and I 've been followed by my great success success .
And what I have to keep me when I feel electually eled by this is , it 's not fear .
It 's not just your work .
You can get to the presentation of your part , any can be .
If your work is balling , you know .
If the divine , assurd it to you get a decide to leave a few of wonderful , for a moment through your foreehead , and then , " Ole ! "
Or , you do the same dance .
And " Ole ! " You get the same .
I think and I think , I have to teach it .
" Ole ! " You just at the same , even for a human and testing tals and testing tals from doing to make you continue .
Thank you .
Thank you .
June Cohen : Ole !
You know , I 've already talked about some of these projects on the human genome , what can mean and the discovery new new genes .
Now we 're starting a new path : we started to digitalize biology and now starting from that digital code we are entering in a new phase of biology , designing and synthizing and synthizing and enthizing life .
We always tried to ask a great questions .
" What is the life ? " It 's something that many biologists have tried to understand vararms .
We tried different approaches , reduced the minims .
We 're digitalizing from almost 20 years .
When we sequenced the human genome was retreated to the analome of the biology of the world .
Now we ask , we can regenerate life , or to create new life from this digital universe ?
This is the map of a little organism , the Mycoplasm genitalium , which is the smallest genome that can authorem in the lab .
And we tried to reduce the genome of the genome to create a little bit more .
We can eliminate a hundred genes of genes of about 500 that are here .
But when we look at his mapt , it 's relatively simple than our .
I think that 's simple .
But when we look at all the genes that we can eliminate , one at the time , it 's very unlikely that this can bring a living cells .
So we decided that the only way to progree was to synthize this chromosoma in a way that we could get the components to the components to the components to some of these fundamental questions .
And so we started the adventure of " can we be intetization to a chromosoma ? "
Can it confeeling to produce these great molecules that we never had to create these great molecules that we never had to create before ?
And , in case , we can make a chromosoma ?
A chromosoma is just a piece of inert material .
The speed with which we can digitalize the life is growing to the exponential life is growing .
Our capacity to write the genetic code , instead , propropropropropropropropropropropropropropropropropropropropropropropropropropropropropropropropropropropropropropropropropropropropropropropropropropropropropropropropropropropropropropropropropropropro
And our most recent results are the exponential on a curve .
We started more than 15 years ago .
The process has require a lot of passages , starting with biothetic revision before I started experiments .
But we found that synthize DNA is very difficult .
There are tens of thousands of machines in the world that produced little segments of DNA , over 30 to 50 letters and it 's a degenerative process : the longer is longer , the most mistakes are .
So we had to develop a new method to make these framments and correcrect the error .
And that 's the first attempt , to partician , from the digital genome of the X 174 .
It 's a little virus that kills bacterial .
We designed the fragments , actually , effects the mistakes and get a molecule of DNA , about 5,000 lettes .
The interesting part is when we took this piece of inhert chemical material , and we put it in bacterial , bacterial code and propering the viral particles .
The viral particles have been released by cells , they went back and they have destructed the E.
I 've been talking about recent membres of the oil industry is saying that they have a certain that they have this model .
They have reward more than you .
We think this is a situation where the software can really build his hardware in a biological system .
But we wanted to do things in great .
We wanted to build the entire chromosoma .
They are more 580 mila letters of genetic code .
So we thought we could build it in the cast of the size , so that we can change the cassets to understand what the components of a living cells .
The design is crucial , and if we start with digital information in a computer , these have to be very accurate .
When we sequenced this genome for the first time in 1995 , the standard was a mile for every 10 mile .
We found it , resequenced , 30 mistakes . If we had that original sequence never would be able to do it .
One part of the process is designing over 50 land-leck segments with all the other segments of 50 letters to build subits little bit smaller than working together .
We try to get a single elements here .
You probably probably read that we 'd read that we 're going to be the blind of the filigate .
Think about this : we have a genetic code on four letters : A , C , G and TG and .
Three of those letters together with about 20 advancing about 20 advocal advancing , and there 's a specific order of reading for every fright-the-in-acid admulti-acting , and there 's a specific order of reading .
So we can use genetic code to write words , frasases , thinking .
What we did at the beginning was autographed .
Some of them were dollar from the fact that it wasn 't poem .
We designed these segments to just just just a brick with the enzymes .
There are encies that are relevant to them .
And we started to assemble the parts , starting with segments from five to seven mila letters , unending up the segments of 24 mile letters at the end of 24 mile , and they get 72 mile .
Everything we 've made these segments in abundance so that we 're trying to get out of creating a very robustobustobestobustobestobestobestobestoks -- as you 'll see in a minute .
We 're looking for self-looking at the process .
So , this looks like the tabellon a board of a basket .
When we get these very long , much more than 100 miles , the most of 100 miles , they will not grow up in the E.
It 's the recenter of modern biology .
So we 've been considered other mechanisms .
We knew about another mechanism called the omologa called omologa , which in biology is to repair the DNA to get DNA segments .
Here 's an example .
This organism , called Deinococcus . It can absors three million radiodurans .
You can see in the superior as his crumosoma is destructed .
In 12 -- 24 hours , it 's replacement exactly like that before .
They 're able to do that .
These organisms can sit with this organisms .
They can live under empty .
They are absolutely the life exists in space , and you feel to find new environments of water .
In the NASA showed that this is .
This is a picture of molecule that we built by using these processing processing , by using the design of the appropriate design of the appropriate design .
The lights assemble .
This image is not been taken with a microscope , but with a microscope .
It 's a molecule , so that we can see it with a light microscope .
These are pictures that are doing a period of about six seconds .
This is the publisher we did a little time ago .
They are more 580,000 letters of genetic code .
It 's the biggest molecules of a definite structure that 's ever created from man .
It 's got a weight of 300 million million .
If you stamp it with a 10 without spaces , you 'd like to 142 pages to the only to transcscream this genetic code .
Now , how do we do it ?
Obviously , a virus is a game from kids .
It 's a little bit more complicated when they use bacterial bacterial .
It 's simpler also when it 's about euthy cells like our : you can just get the nucleo and put it up and put another , which is basically the process of clonation .
In the bacterial chromosome is integrated inside the cells , but we recently force we 're able to do a complete trapipe of a cell cell cell cell , a cell cell of a cell cell , to another and activity .
We can get a chromosoma , from a microbial species .
The two are different as the men from the topes .
We added some gene more so that we can decide what to this chromosoma .
The then I 'm sleep with the enzymes to kill all the proteins .
And when we put it in in the cells was study -- and appreciate our sophphotom -- the new chromosome -- the new chromosome -- the new chromosome .
And we were really thinking that we couldn 't go beyond , but we tried to get more in there .
This is one of the major mechanisms of evolution .
We found that many species have added in a second or a third chromosoma somewhere , add in a second thousand new tracks in a second thousand new tracks .
So who thinks about evolution as a gene and the time you have modies , it didn 't understand a lot of the biology .
They 're going to be a fairly , the restription that will be to do DNA .
The chromosoma that was in the cells that it 's not one .
The cell phone , the cell phone cell , which we have inserito----cell cell phones .
It 's expressed , and he recognized the other crumosoma as an material material , and the masticated , and we 've got a cell and the new chromosoma .
It 's been blue because of the genes we 've inserted .
And in a short leverage of time , all the characteristics of a species are going to lose , and it 's transformed all in a new new species , based on the new software that we 've inserted in the cells .
All the protects have changed , the membranes have changed , and when we read the genetic genetic code . exactly what we 've transfted you .
Now , this might seem alchemy genetic , but altering the software , we can change the things in a way of a substantial .
Now , I 've already explained that 's not talking about genesis -- but to progress from three million years and a half of evolution , and I said that maybe we 're going to create a new version of Cambrian explosion of Cambrian explosion of this digital process .
Why do that ?
I think it 's pretty obvious when we think of our needs .
We 're going to go from six billion and a half billion people in the next 40 years .
Right for an example : I was born in 1946 .
Now there are three people on the planet for each existent in 1946 .
We 're getting problems now to find food , fresh water and heavy and the weline for six billion and a half billion people .
It 's still going to be more than that .
We use more than five billion fuels , more than 30 billion fuels , more than 30 billion .
That means a hundred million barises a day .
When I call you looking at the biological processing , or any kind of process to reproducing them , it will be a huge challenge .
We have to keep all the way of CO2 emission of these materials that ended up in the atmosphere .
In the day , thank you to the scientific discovery in the world , we have a database with about 20 million genes , and I like to think that are the components of the future .
The electronic industry is just a dozen of components , and think about how many different things are coming out .
Our limitations are data from the biological reality and our imagination .
Now we have techniques , because of these rapid methization , can create what we call genomics .
We can build a big robot that can produce a million crumosomes a day .
Think about 20 million genes of these 20 million genes or to get to get to the processing processing , and new vaccines , and we can change , and thank , and we can change , thank , and create more biology now that in the last 20 years of science .
And it 's just a standard wild .
We can choose for the chance of survival , chemical production or fuel , or production of vaccines .
This is a instantaneous instantaneous software programmed that we 're working to be able to set and design species .
Well , we don 't know how they will be .
We know exactly what their genetic code .
Now we 're focusing on the high-generation .
You 've seen even even throw out of the grant was a weless experiment .
We have fuels on the second and third generation that will be going to be like the cool of the higher , as the either either , as the either either generation .
But the only way the biology can have a great impact without incrementing the cost of food and constantly cost of food and limitations the conservation would turn to the CO2 in matter before , for which which we 're working for design cells that can reach , and we can think of the first fuels that can reach that , and we think of that we can have the first fuels of the quarters of the cost of quarters .
The light solar light with the CO2 is a metodo-- but in our discovery , very different metods .
This is a organism that we described in 1996 .
It 's about 2,000 feet of the deep ocean , about 2,500 feet of the water .
They create a meter from CO2 using hydrogen molecular as energy .
We 're trying to figure out if we can get the CO2 , that can easily be translated to tramite tubes , convert that CO2 in carbon , to drive that process .
So , a short penis that we could be able to increase what the question of " which is the human . " We grew , " What 's life is . We have the goal of repair the interal industry .
Exactly . If you don 't do that from TED , where can you ?
It would be a main fundamental source .
And also , we 're working for using the same metods to create vaccines .
You saw this year with flu , we 're always going to go back to a year and with a dollar , when it 's going to find the right .
I think what you can change is building bunch combinable vaccines in anticipating .
That 's how the future might start to look like to change , now , the tree of evolution , accelerating evolution with the synthetic bacterial cells , and infinally cell cells .
We 're so much from the improundable to improve people .
Our discovery is to do that way to live enough to try to get it . Thank you very much .
First of all I 'll show you , the most rapidly possible , some fundamental work , of the new technology that we 've taken Microsoft in following a year ago . This is Seadragon .
It 's a environment where you can interact with a huge amount of data that remote with a huge amount of data visual .
Here we 're seeing a lot of gabyte digital phoom with a kind of phoom and continuous , for a fast-sand-up photos , avoid the images like we want .
And it doesn 't matter how big the amount of information that we see , how great these collections are .
Most are common photographs , but this for example is a scanning from the Biotech of Congress , and I 'm going to recenter in the gamel of 300 megaxing .
It doesn 't make any difference because the only thing that 's the only thing that the prestations of a system like this is the number of your skeleton on the screen in any time . It 's also very flexible architecture .
This is a book or , of data not images .
This is the Dickens . Every colonna represented a capol .
To show you that it 's just about text and not images , we can do something like that , to see that is a real representation of the text , not a photo .
It could be a little artificial to read a electronic book .
Not the advice .
This is a most realistic example . It 's a number of the Look .
Every image is the beginning of a seition .
And it really gives you the pleasure of the pleasure of reading the version of a magazine , or a quotidian , which is for nature of a molteplplus .
We also did something with the corner of this particular number of the Look ,
We created a higher advertional publisher , much higher than what you use in a normal advertising . And we 've inserted up of the content .
If you want to see the characteristics of this automobile , you can see here .
Or other models , or even the specific techniques .
And that really shows some of these ideas to eliminating the limits of space on the screen of space .
We hope that that that means to put up the pop-up and other porcheries , and more like , not to be necessarily necessarily .
Of course , the map is one of the most obvious applications for this kind of technology .
And on this is not lose time , if we don 't tell you that we have contribute to give up this field .
These are all the streets in the U.S. subvil , over a NASA .
So now we go to something else .
This is actually actually actually from the Web ; you can go to see it .
It 's a project called Photosynthetic , which combine two different technologies .
One is Seadragon and the other is a visual computer computer computer made by Noah Snavely , a student University of Washington , with the aid of Steve Seitz Seitz 's UW Seitz Szi MW Szi . "
And it 's from the worth on the webbsite ,
You can see it when we do this kind of patterns , where we can go from a picture to the other and have this kind of experience to the other , and have this multiple experience .
But the space of the pical clocation here has actually a meaning .
The algorithms of visualization , the computer have recorded these images together , so that they have been screamong the retired of the network that I imagine -- all close to the Magne Roccies -- canadesion Magne Roccies -- they have been scatted . Here we give you the date of a de-stable , and these things have been doing .
I don 't know if I have time to show you some other environment .
There are some more space .
I want to go directly to one of the Noah-- and this is from a previous prototype of Photosyntheless we 've done for the first time , last sometimes , to show you what I think is really the close time , to show you what I think is really the key key to show you what the reality is really clear by looking at the environments that we put in the website .
We had to worry about legal aspects and forth .
This is a reconstruction of Notter 's Notter 's Tr. Bastic digital , Bastic digital . Bastic Noth Dame in Flickr and you get images of these things in magic . And so , you have a of these coni coni coni .
So they are all the Flickr and they 're all connected to the space in this way .
And it 's possible to navigate this very simple way .
You know , I 'd never thought to end up to work for Microsoft .
It 's very gratificent to get this kind of account here .
I think you can see that it 's a lot of different photocameras : from those of the cell phones of the SLR , a meaning , a meaning , put together in this environment .
And if I can , I try to look at those more strange .
Many are blown from doing it , etc .
Somewhere there is a series of photographs -- there 's a series of photographs --
This is a Noter of Notre Dame record .
We can go from the poster to the physical view of this environment .
The essential point is that we can do things with social environment . This is now taking data from the whole memory of how to apping the whole memory of how to apping the land , from the visual point of view -- and connected those data together together .
All those pictures become connected together , more than the sum of the parts .
You have a whole land model .
Think about this as a prolungation of Stephen Lawler on Earth .
It 's something that grow in complexity as well as people use it , and the advantages of the use of the use of .
They have hushed with metaded by other people .
If somebody comes the idea of to contrast all of these things say , the name of the name , my pictures of Noth Dame improvised by a requires of all of those data , and I can use how to make a point of a rest of a space , and I can use how to the photo to the pictures of anymore , and having a photo-user experience of a scape of a type of cross-user ,
Of course , a consequence of all of this is extremely a consequence of all interesting than the Earth , collection , it doesn 't just take a lot of it .
Milles .
Chris Anderson : I 've got to do it ? What your software is going to take is that at a certain point , in the next few years , all the years , all of the world are going to be practically connected with ?
BAA : Yes . What 's doing is doing it .
It 's creating hyperlink , if you want , you , in the images .
And it 's doing it in the basis of the images .
The thing becomes very interesting if you think about the rich information semantic information that many of these images .
As when you do a research on the website , you get a phrase and the text on the webbs on the webbs .
Now , what happens if that picture is connects to all your pictures ?
So the amount of interconnection and the amount of rich , and the amount of of rich is really huge classical . It 's a classical classical classical .
CA : Blaise , it 's really incredible . Compice .
BAA : I thank you very much .
One of the most most most lights when you travels and one of the Tetnographics is the way we can live between who has no antial antial traditions , which has a whole time in the wind , you get the past in the wind , the wind the wind , the spheter in the levision of the plants and lower the plants .
Bastes think the chiamans Jaguar viaggiate the Lattea , or that the Man anthropolicy , or that the anthes of Inuit are still collished meaning , or that in Himalaya , the buddists are still the respire of the anthropology of anthropology , and the idea that the world in which we live in a way that the world , but it 's just a model , but it 's just a model ,
the consequence of a particular adaptative choices that our styrpes has done , well , many generations ago .
And , of course , we all share of the essential tracts .
We all proof it . We all procreating .
We 're subjects to start .
We need to deal with the inexorability of death , so we don 't surprising if we 're going to get and whom and whom --
We all have a art .
What it does is the particular rhythm of the song , the rhythm of the dance of every culture .
It doesn 't matter that are the Penan Thanks of the Borneo , or the follow Vodoo 's the guerriers of Haiti , or the desert Kenya , or the Curan 's desert , or a campaign in the Sahara .
He was my journey of the journey in the desert a month ago , or a yak in the world 's values of the world 's world .
All of these people teaches us are other ways of exists , other ways of existing other ways of thinking , other ways of transsitting in the world .
And , if you think , if you think a bad thing .
And then , the myriads of the world creating a re-inner life , creating a spiritual life and cultural for the well-being of the planet as a kind of like the planet as biosphere .
And you can think about this retent , a writing , as a ethnosphere , and you can call the exnosphere is the total of all the concepts , dreams , and mits intuitions , intuitions , intuitions , intuitions ,
The etnosphere is the fantastic patriage of humanity .
It 's the symbol of what we can be as much as inquisitive .
And because of the biosphere was a gravly consumed altreat the etnosphere , and it 's very quickly faster .
Nobody biologist , for example , it would say that 50 percent of all species was or is on the orlo of the exintion just because it 's fairly because it 's fairly , or the most apocalm of the world 's biological diversity -- and you don 't even get close to the most optimistic -- that of the cultural diversity .
It 's all of that is , of course , the language .
When you were born 6,000 languages on this planet .
So , a language is not just a vocabulary or from a series of rules .
So , a language is the spring of the human spirit .
It 's the middle with the animal of every culture comes in the material world .
Every language is a forest , a winforest , a thought , a backin , a thinking , a recool of a spiritual possibility .
And of those 6,000 languages , as we are in Monterey , at least the half half of them is not susurrent in the oreches of children .
They 're not teaching children , the children , which means , at least that you don 't have something , that 's already death .
What is more sad than being aved from the silence , of being the last to talk about a language , of being the way of to move the wisdom of the saves of the children ?
This is a little bit of a few of the world in some of the world every two weeks : every two weeks a couple and a door and a door and a hang language .
And I know somebody 's 's not better .
The world would not be a better place if you 're talking about all the same language ? " Benissim , then we talk about the yoruba . We talk about the dotone-of-the-or-like .
I 'm going to talk about kogi .
You 're going to be a tract thing that means we can 't talk about your language .
I 'd like to do you to do a journey through the etnosphere --
a little journey in the etnosphere to give you a assay of what we 're losing .
Many of us are forget that when I say , " different ways of existing . " I mean , " different ways of existing .
We take for example , the Barasana , in Amazonia , the popular anacond , the popular of anaconda , which creates the myth of the latte of latte of sleep in the west sandwers .
It 's a popular popular that 's not able to distinguish the blue color from the green time , because the time you were identifed in the forest , which depends on the popular .
They have a strange language and a matrimonial rule , called " exogamia . " " What 's a different language . "
All of this has radical in the past mitological , yet the particularity is that in these families in these families in the major families because of matrimmons is that in the mystical herself .
They 're limited to listen and then they start talking .
We take one of the most interesting tribe with which I lived , the Waoran Ecuador of the Ecuador , an incredible popular popular people who had the earliest contacts in 1958 .
In 1957 missionarian trial construct a factor .
They had done from the top of the photographs that came back to the camera that was going to get amichevoli , and forest that this popular forest had never seen anything whom had ever seen anything whom had had had had had seen anything wherever .
They collect the photoes , they went to the research , or a shape , and not found anything , they had concluded that it was the hold , and they 'd kill the five missionary with the lance .
But the Waorans don 't kill the stranies .
They kill with them .
Of 54 percent of the mortality was caused by their same .
We 've sitting at eight generations and we found two natural morath and when we 've been remarkable to know , they lose that one of them was invecent , and then they 'd kill it , and then they killed it .
The cruers were able to recognize the animal from 40 steps and recognize the species .
In the early ' 80s , I 've been assigned a task , when my professor of Harvard , if I wanted to go to Haiti to Haiti to the base of the potence of Duvalier and Tonton Macoaler and Tonton Macoaler and I 'd embrunch of the velon the veill-up , I was a fairs of the veillands .
To make a sense of a miracologist , I 'd have to understand the Vodoo culture is not magic .
It 's pretty much about a metaphor vision of the world .
Many interesting .
If I ask you to tell me the great religions of the world , what would you say ?
Cristianesimum , Islam , Budddism , Ebraism , etc .
It 's always left out , thinking that the sub-Saharan Africa has no religious feels . And instead and yes and the Vodoo is not the other things that the distilside of these religious concepts of these religious concepts .
What makes the interesting voodoo is the intense race between life and death .
So the vision they can be hide the spirites .
The spiriters can be invoced by the Grande Acqua , they resident to the dance and they get time time time time for a short , and they get time for a short , and the way that for a short short , and they get the following becomes the .
So , for that the voodooists , you know , " You know , white , you go to talk about God .
We say , in the temple and say God . "
And from the moment you 're going to be a ball of the right that you drive to you , how bad can you do ?
So you 'd have these incredible events : following the voodoo in the state of trance that touch with a refuels that they touch up a demonstration , rather force of the power of mind when it 's catalyzed in a state of extreme .
In all the popular of which I lived the most extraordinary is the Kogi Sierra Nevada Santa Marta , in the Santa Marta , in the Santee .
It was reporting of the major civilization that once once they lived on the caraibic plants of the Colombia in the conquicist , the popular mass , which was ritic on plants .
In a continent snail , this popular , this popular has ever been conquisted by the dail .
But they 're now now now now are governmentally extraordinary .
The young people are being taken from the families to three or four years , and live in a secret world , and live secret in a buy world of the ice ice ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice for 18 years .
Two ods nine years of the noine years of proposition to reproduce the nine months of the agement that transformation in the the ushor of the Grande Mother .
So , for all that time , they 're acculturate values of their society , values that they 're going to see that their pyyes and only their pyyer , and they 're going to do the cost of the ecological equilibrium .
In the term of this incredible initiation , they 're suddenly layed up and for the first time in their 18 , at the age of 18 years , they see a dry . And in that accounterial of the first ball of the values of beautiful beautiful , everything that they 've learned in theory is a spent , all that has learned in theory . The pret is a step back , and it does a pass , and it does a pass on the end , and it 's saying , and it 's the first time ,
" I said , " Would you like to you .
It 's study . It 's really about you protect it . "
They call greater greater brothers and say that we are , the minors of the destruction of the world .
This level of intuition is extremely important .
When we think of the indigenous populations and the invote Roussea and the old story of the noble noble , which is a razon the noble concept in his simple simple simple , maybe invoice , and we say that these people are closest to the Earth .
The popular of the nis feeling nis feeling from the nostalges .
There 's no space for these things in the palual palud of the Asmallat the winds of Tibet , but thank you to the time and the rites , they created a mystics of Earth , they made a mystical intuition of the Earth is not about a little bit more sot-tle py-off conscious conscious , the concept that the Earth can only live in because it 's infused by the consciousness .
What does it mean ?
It means that a little bit of the Ande that 's the guy who grew up the mountain is a spirit Apu that will be a human being destiny , and it will report a different pace with the mountain that will be a different lot with the mountains of the Montana that was credating mountain , a little bit of rocks , and it 's a mountain of rocks that will be a a mountain .
That 's the dimora of a spirit or a mineral cutteral is irrelevant .
What 's interesting is the metaphor that defines the relationship between individual and the natural world .
I grew up in the forests of the Columbia credary of the forests to be cut .
And that 's a human being different from my friends Kwakiutl that believe that the forests are the forests of Hukuk and the batch of the paradise and the batch of the paradise and the bats that live in the world , spiriters that they are living in the Hamatsa .
If you start to consider that these cultures can create different reality , you can start to understand some of them feeling . We make this plants .
I 've been showed this photo april the nordoccctor .
Maybe some of you 've heard about the ayahuash , the most powerful psycotive repertotoire .
What makes it fascinating the ayahuash is not the potential of the substance , but his election . It 's made his election . It 's made from two elements .
On the side , this lian legal land-carbon , a series of cool , harmful and harmful , harmful and , very far .
Take the only plants has a blumn fuel that altera little bit of the consciousness , but it 's myth-up the family of a coffee , and he said , Psychotria , of the coffee ,
This plants have triptamines , very similar to the serotonin , dimethylptamine , methoxydimethoxydimethypamine .
If you 'll ever see Yanomami , you 'll see Yanomami to the birth chemical substance that do with a different species , which is contains .
And I think about the pounds on the nose is a little bit like to be dissolution from a carc .
I 'd just to do with my professor , Richard Evan Shultes , the man who has been sent the psychc , with his discovery of the fungi , with his discovery of the fungi of the lower fungi in the ' 30 in Mexico .
I think my text can 't go to the tamines like hallucints like hallucinated because if you 're not going to tell nobody to be hallucinated . They can 't tell anyone to be hallucinated by a enthy , because they are denied by a zoysis , because they are dened by a labor , and it 's dases .
It 's possible to assume , if they 're assume with other chemicals that denist dens-dens .
Now , it 's the beautiful beauty : the becomes in this lian inner is a MAO , of the same kind of necessary to potential trippamines . The question is the question in a flap : in a flag of 80,000 species , like these people who are in a flant two deethy deployed , how are they create a biochemical version that can be a biochemical version that 's perhaps soer is sum that 's sound ?
We use the great eusususuit of the proof of the proof the grore , that can reveal in the infrule .
But if we ask the Indians , they 'll tell you " The plants are talking about . "
What does it mean ?
This tribe , the Cofan , has 17 variety of ayahuasks , which are nectly in the forest , and that 's our eyes would be remarkable in the same species .
If you ask them how they get stbilion their tassonomy will say , " I was thinking about it , and I got to do it . "
The solution is : you take the 17 variety of the moon , and each one will be a different doterial .
I 'm not laurea in Harvard , but it 's much more interesting that content the stami .
Now , [ applaushers ] the problem is that even the people who have to cover them are peats , but somehow reducts are worlddges , but somehow reducts to our real world , and pass .
In fact , the Xth century , between 300 years , it 's not going to be remembered for his guerors or innovations , but rather as the one was where we stopped and active actively , and we 've been active and active clumn , and cultural ctually , the world is not the change .
All the cultures through the centuries are involved in a dance for new life .
And the problem is not the technology is not technology .
The Indians Sioux not to be Sioux when they put up and get in the arch and the recage like that Americans don 't have stopped to be American , when they put out and heat and the heat and and heat .
It 's not the change or technology that 's the integrity of the etnosphere . It 's the power .
The last flight flight .
And if you give a look at the world , you 'll find that these are not destinated cultures .
They are living and dynamics and spints from the hyperformance existence of hyperforces that will go beyond their skills .
I know that 's disboscing in the Penan Penan --
a popular nor made of Sarest asian , in the west asian who lights lights up to a generation , and now reduced to a generation ago , and now reduced to the prostitution of the rivers of the rivers of the river of the back of the lim , which looks like , where the river 's remarkable to the Meridic , where the navoid lived the guns , where the navails are lights ,
Woman to pay the wood stone with the subtact to the forest .
Or , the Yanomami , are the disease that are the disease that I got to the end of the gold .
If we move on on the mountains of Tibet , where I 'm doing a lot of research , you 'll see the hard hard .
As you know the genocide , the physical extinction of a popular popular , is a universal level , but the destruction of a popular life , not just a popular popular , not just a popular popular , but advvanced by existed in certain environments .
And you can 't understand the suffering of Tibet until you go from the beginning .
I 've been going to get the 6,000 miles from Chengdu through Tibet sudoriental , to the back to Lhasa with a young colleague , but only came to Lhasa young colleague , but only came to Lhasa , I realized what 's behind .
6,000 sacres reducts in the pounds and cenjoying .
1.2 million people killed by military during the Cultural Rivolution .
The father of this guy was ascriticized at the Panchen Lama .
which means that it was killed to the Chinese invasion .
And the soon is sent with Santity in Santity in the diaspora that 's popular in Nepal .
Scim mother was imprigioned and his colst was to be rich .
It was brought to the age of two years from the age of two years , hidden under his gonna because it could not have a living without him .
The sister , which did the same , it was mitted in reeducation .
A day has inavailed calculating a writing Mao and , for this transgression , was mitted to the jobs , it was mitted to seven years .
Tibet is to be inoveroveroveroveroveroveroveroveroveroveroverpopular is from tener .
Or the end , all of it reduce to a choice .
We want to live in the world 's world of the monothic world , or we want to get the world polycles of diversity ?
The great anthropologic anthropologic anthropologist said that his biggest fear was that , in our way to do this friend of the world , we don 't just see the entire gamorous imagination of human reduction .
And it 's umillion to remember that our species is existed for 600,000 years .
The Neolitic Rivolution , who gave us the agriculture , that has done us sockycle of the seed of the seme of the smomly , creating the poetry of the trial of the trial trial of the specialization , and we talk about 10,000 years ago .
The modern world industry has been taken 300 years .
That 's the squality of the story that we haven 't suggested that we have the answered that we have to deal with the millennia to come .
When to these myth of the world is asked what it means to be human , they resident with 10,000 different voices .
And it 's in these answers that we all have the chance of being what we are : a conscious species , which has to do all the populations and all the giard-like , and all the giard-like , and there are great moments of optimism .
I 've been shown this picture on the northern extremely North island , when I went to the whaled Inuit , and this man , Olaya , Olaya , he told me the wonderful story of his grandfafafather .
The canadd government has been given with the Inust-and-up popular popular . And in the ' 50s to stbilide our own colonies .
The grandfather of this man reflow to go .
The family , I teming her life , and he took it all the me , and all his atteckers .
You have to know that Inuit doesn 't temon the cold , they do it .
The pattins of the slitters were made of fishing skin .
The grandfather of this man didn 't have a met of the artics or from the librarian .
It 's sgattle , it 's calculated the pantalone in the skin and defoca defecated in your hand . When I did the fit , you get up , and they 're working on a lama .
It 's spring up on the shoulder of this kkkkkill , and when it became solid , he killed a dog .
It has a sleep and created a brighter , with the actic cassleep , has a sleep , and it 's disappeared on the banks , and it 's disappeared on the banks , and it 's disappeared on the banks ,
We want to talk about cavarsely with nothing ?
In the aprile 1999 , the world 's English government has a total control of a total area of a largest territory of the biggest California and Texas I put together .
It 's the new patria . It 's called Nunavut .
It 's a independent territory . They honto all the minerarial resources .
One of the examples of how a natione-state can recognize with his popular .
And , to finish , I think it 's pretty obvious at least at those remote song of the planet , and realizing that they don 't have remote remote at all .
For somebody 's home .
They represent severtions of the human imagination that will sent the date of the time . And for all of these children , as the dreams of these children , as the dream of the geography of hope .
First , we know Geographic Geographic is going to be at anything .
We believe that the polemic --
[ Applausi is not persuasive , but we think that the stories can change the world , and maybe we think the world , maybe we 're the best institution to tell the stories of the world . Every month of our website .
156 countries spent our television canal canal canal canal .
Our rivists are being lette from millions of people .
Our work is travel in the etnosphere to bring our audience in places of wonderful cultural , from which will go to how they 've seen and , you know , and they will hope , and they will , and they will be able to , and they will have to find the world 's central anthropology of life in a pluralist and we have to find a life in a pluralist and to find a life in a pluralist and to get a life in a pluralist of life in a pluralist and we can go to the main life in a life in a life in the world ,
where the wisdom of all the populations can contribution to our weless weless .
Thank you .
I 'm going to talk about some things that I wrote in this book that I hope you 've heard and try to get to prove some of the connections , in case you didn 't notice them .
I want to start with what I call " the official dogma official .
The dogma official dogen of what ?
The dogma official dogma , the Western official society . The official dogma , " If we want to massive the well-being of our citizens . "
The reason is , from one side , in fact that freedom is a value , is pretious , is pretious , is the essential for human beings .
On the other one of us can do it for all of us can agree with it to do everything that massive to do with all that that massive .
The way to massive freedom is massive to massive .
More choice people are , more liband are the most of the freedom , the more of their well-being .
This , I think , it 's so deeply radicated in the society that nobody would be to put it in doubt .
And it 's also deppth in our lives .
I 'm going to show you some examples of what progress has made possible .
This is my supermarket . It 's not particularly great .
I lose a simple note on the ununcondition .
In my supermarket , there are 175 condition , without content 10 variety of the Golive . And 12 aceters , which you can buy it for a huge amount of condition of the inct of the inct of the inct circy that nobody of one of the 175 proning is your degrees .
Here 's the supermarket .
Then you go to the electronic store to buy a stereo : CD lector , the CD lector , radio , the CD , the lefer .
And in this single core , there 's a great number of audio components .
We can make six and a half million different combinations , using components that there are just a store .
You have to admit that there is a lot of choice .
Other camps : the world of communications .
Once , when I was a child , they could get all the telephone services , at the pat the pat that were fornitephotos .
It was going to get the phone , you didn 't buy it .
It 's a consequence of that , the other thing was that the phone would never break .
These days are going .
We have a lot of almost ildlife , especially between cell phones .
Here 's the cell phones of the future .
My favorite is that in the middle , MP3 , tapes of birth , and the force to the bunch for the brulele .
If you don 't have any seen in the store under the house , you 're going to be a lot of it will get .
And what happens is that people are going to go in in the gots and it does this question . And you know , what the answer is " No .
It 's not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn 't do too much .
So , in other things that are much important than the acquired of the acquired , the same explosion of choices .
Axxxture : The health is not happening in the United States that you go from the doctor and the doctor you need to do .
And instead , I go to the doctor , and the doctor says , " OK , we could do . "
You say , " Dottore , what would I do ? "
And the doctor says , " A has these benefits and these risks , and B has these benefits and these risks . "
" What do you want to do ? "
And you recover if she was me , what would you do ? "
And the doctor : " But I 'm not her . "
The result of the result we call the malked " " , " expression that makes it look like .
But it 's actually not that one to move the weight and responsibility to take decisions from somebody who knows something , which is the doctor , to qualcanybody knows -- and so it 's not about it 's ideal , and so not in the ideal condition to make the patient decisions .
There 's a huge marketing of products , drug in the world , like me and you , that if you think about it has no sense , because you think we can 't buy them .
But if we can 't buy them , because they public them ?
The answer is that they want to be in the morning we call the doctor to ask the recipe .
What 's so fundamental as our identity is a question of choice , as you see in this one is a choice of choice , " We don 't want to forcing the children . They 'll give their sex sex at at the moment . " I don 't know , we need to inventing it .
And we can reinvented how many times you get to us .
which means that every morning , at the risvehicle , you have to decide that kind of person .
It was a family and the matrimony , a time the common , a time , a lot of the common , which was that there was a longer possible , and it was starting to make the more soon possible .
The only verage was with who , not when , and even when , and even even what do .
Ose , it 's really to play .
I 'm sitting at students very smart , and I do their 20 percent of the time .
And it 's not because they are not just brilliant because they are not less diligent .
but why are I impensierites , I mean , I 'd like to get to me or not ? I should do that now ? "
" Do I have to get me later ? "
They are interrogative logiorants .
And they try to answer these questions , even if this implment is not an accountations that I 'm going to get a bel vote to my examples .
And they have to do it . They are important questions .
Now , the work : we are lucky , like Carl underneath , because technology allows us to work every minute , every day , from every corner of the planet , transpent from Hotel Randolph .
In the parentent , there 's a corner , and I didn 't tell nobody who , where the WiFi works .
I don 't tell you , because I want to use it .
What does that mean , this incredible freedom of choice that we have about work ? It 's to continue , continually , if we have to work or not .
We can go to see our son play with the cell phone , with the cell phone in a pocket , Blackberry in the other , and the notebook , and the notebook , and the notebook ,
And even if they are all spent , every minute that we see our son , to find out , we 're also asking up , " I got to answer this called ? "
" I have to answer this email ?
And even when the answer is " no , all this makes the experience of your son , very different from what it would be in other conditions .
So , from any part of the look , little things and great material , materials and life , life is a question of choice .
Once the world was this : Ovreal , there were some possibilities , but it wasn 't a question of choice .
The world of today looks like this : The dilemma is , " Is it . " Is it . "
The answer is Same :
The positives ves them all , so I 'm going to talk about the negative ones .
It 's all this choice two effects of the people .
The first , paradox , is that produced paralysis that it 's paralysis .
With many many options between which choice , becomes very hard to do it .
I give you an example of a meaning : a study on the voluntext of volunteer .
A my colleague had access to the data of the Vange of the source of the source of a clients of pink clients in 2,000 different companies .
What she found is that for every 10 solutions that are offering in more , the percentage of the adesion of two percent .
With 50 source funds , there is 10 percent in less adesions than when they are only five . Why ?
Because with 50 four-fourth fourth , is maleding , it 's maledly hard to decide , and choice is remain in .
And to ask tomormorrow , and again , tomormorrow , and of course , tomorrow , and of course , it 's going to ever .
You can 't just mean that these work from old old old old , because they don 't have enough money , because they don 't have enough money , it means that the decision is so ostics that allow is that allow the birth-source fundamental fundamental fundamental fundamental fundamental fundamental fundamental fundamental
Not participating , they 're losing until five to the dator of work , which would be a worth .
So the paralysis a consequence of having too many choices .
And I think it makes the world like that .
" And to end , " What 's the ketchup , " Do you get the emaion ? "
You 'd just take the right decision , if it 's for the eternity , right ?
You don 't want to choose the wrong wrong , and you can 't get the wrong condition .
So that 's the first effect . The second is that even if we can get to avoid the paralsis and do a choice , at the end of how we 'd be done with less options .
And that 's about the different reasons .
One of these is that with a lot of people who would choose , if you buy a and it 's not perfect , it 's easy to imagine that you would have a different choice that would be better . And what happens is that the alternative , you 'd have been better . And what happens is that the alternative assuddenly died the soddisfemed of choice , and the rempishes the soddisfresh ,
even when it was a great decision .
More choice there are more easy displeasasure than any detection that 's insodation-choice .
And also , there is what economists call expensive opportunities .
Dan Gilbert has close very well as the value of things that we think about .
Or , when there are so many options , it 's easy to represent the characteristics of the highnative alternative alternative arms and being less subdemands .
Here 's an example . I 've got a lot of people who are not New York .
But that 's probably what you 'd think you 'd probably think .
There 's this copy of Hampons .
A lussian place of lussian place .
It 's very wide . Otly day . It 's all about them .
Not all of it . But what he thinks is , " Well , maledition , is Agotten . "
" All my neighbors in Manhattan is on . "
" I could talk about it just in front of the house . "
And it 's going to go up two weeks and I 'll get a chance of a day -- the chance of parking where you want .
The expensive opportunities to deminule the subdisfation for what we have , when the choice was a cell .
And more are the options that we have to consider , more the characteristics will get to the expensive .
Here 's another example .
This is telling us a lot of things .
It 's about the living moment , and maybe live in the likely .
But the most important thing is that anything you choice , you get the most important thing .
The things that we don 't choose are a lot of attractive , that can make less attractive what we do .
And third point : the spiral growing of expectations .
I tried my skin buying a new couple jeans .
I 'm almost always jeans .
Once the jeans were just like a kind of , buy them and baby , were discomodissies , just after I had them a life and work and work with a lot of times , they were starting to go well .
So , I went to buy a couple of new when the old old old were going , and I said , " I need a couple of jeans , this is my cut . "
The commit says , " Loods want slim , and the relationship , axed , rely fit ? "
You want to do it with the cerniera or with the bottons ? " Stonegae " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " Hed " " " " " " " " "
" Look at the laps ? "
" Sotto them up or stretttareas -- " Contuating to elencounter .
I was swhorger , and after a little bit of a little bit I could say , " I want the one that was the only guy . " I want to do . " I want to do all jeans , and then I tried to all jeans , and then I got out of the best jeans that I had ever had .
It was the massive . I had the best .
But I felt I 'm worse .
Why ? I wrote a book for you to understand it .
The reason I was worse is that with all that I was worse with all that choice was very much , jeans had to be perfect .
I was the beginning of me . I didn 't expect any except of all that when there was one of 100 different , accidents , but at least one guy had to be perfect .
What I had buy buy , but not perfect .
After I had to do that choice with what I was going to be insubsidied in confronted to the expectations .
The add of the options in life of the people don 't do that increasing the excellence of the options of the options of the options of the options .
And that 's going to be less soddisfair , even when the results are good .
Nobody in the world of marketing if you realize .
Because if they knew , you wouldn 't know what I 'm talking about .
It looks like the truth looks more like this .
" He was better when you were worse . " The reason that was better when it was worse is that when it was worse is that when you were worse .
Ose , the world we live in -- opulents , industrialized citizens with the expectancy of feature -- the massive that we can hope is that things are at the alteness of expectations .
You never have surprised as your pleasant expectations , my expectations , and expectations , and I 'm ingigantic .
The secret of happiness -- what you 're here -- is , " Baxis is , " Yes , you want . "
I mean , little whenever I 'm really married and my wife is really amazing and my wife is really amazing .
I couldn 't do it , I couldn 't do it .
But it 's not always a bad thing .
And finally , a consequence of buy a couple of jeans discovered when there 's just that kind of jeans is that when you 're not satic , and you ask , " Why ? "
" Who is responsible ? "
The world is responsible . What can you do ?
When there are hundreds of types of jeans , and you buy a insubsisively , and ask you who is the responsible , is the money that the responsible that you are .
You 'd had to do better .
With hundreds of variety of variety of variety of variety of these insuccess .
So when people take decisions , even if the results is alido , they feel like , and they feel like the herself .
In the last years , the depression is explose in the industry .
I think a meaning factor -- not the only one , but important -- of this onto depression is that people have experiences in the sent experience because the standard are too high .
And when they have to explain this situation is that they think the colst is they .
So the final results is that we 're general better , objectively , but we feel worse .
Let me remember .
This is the official dogma , what we 're all take for buy and it 's completely fly . It 's not true .
There 's no doubt that a little bit of choice is better than I have a little bit better than having any business . But it 's not a little bit better than a little bit .
There 's a critical value , magic . I don 't know what it is .
But I 'm sure we 've been supposed to from a piece of the level where the choice ice ice ice ice ice our life .
Now , from the political view -- I almost finished -- from the political point , the nocction is the following .
What it allows this to the industrial society is the material rickness of material .
There are a lot of places in the world , and you know , where the problem is not that they have a lot of choice .
The problem is that they have too little .
So the factory I 'm talking about is a malbeing exclusive males of modern modern , remarkable society .
And what it does to depress and angry is this : Steve Levitt has talked about how much that expensive and discoveries of how those expensive and discover . It 's a spreh-denly money .
I mean that these choices , complicated and avoid , it 's not that they 're useful .
They are add deleteries .
They do it worse .
If a little bit of what our society in our society is allowed to get to the where people have too few chance , it would not just be their life to better . But our own life .
This is what economists call a paretian improtation .
A redistribution of the income is all of the income of the poor -- because of this choice is that you get up .
To conclude , " You can become all the way you want to become what you want to --
You , people of culture , you think , " But what that fish ? "
" It 's obvious that you can 't do anything in a glass bock . "
" A imagination castrated vision , a limited vision of the world --
and I 'm going to do it , at the beginning .
But then , I think , instead , I realized that that the shorth .
Because the reality of that is that if you mand in frantums , so that , " all of it is possible , " you get the freedom . You get the paralysis .
If you break the bock , so that everything is possible possible to be possible divent the subddisfation .
You get the paralysis , and you get the well-being .
Everybody needs a sphere .
This is almost certainly too closer , maybe even for the fish , and certainly for us .
But the absolutely symbolic symbolic sphere is a recipe for infelity and , for the roof .
Thank you of heart .
