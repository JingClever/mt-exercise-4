The year year I shown these deal , the cyacial dishow that the calculant of the hyththththetic of the U.S. 18 of the United States , which is restreet of the U.S. continental .
But it 's a dream of the gravity of the problem , because it doesn 't show it into the ice .
The cotta glacial mechanics is , in a sense , the heart of the climate system .
You know , you know , you know , you know ,
The next next diavest will be a fast-carrelated carrelated to the last 25 years .
The ice acts are source in the red .
You see , you can see , you know , you know ,
That 's the ice in the winvers , which you 're ritizen .
You can see the cosidgn , of five years or more , is about five years or more , is like the blood of the body .
In 25 years , it 's spend up so .
This is a problem because the reference of interacting the extreme of the ocean . where there are enormous amount of carbon .
Right to the totality of the inquining of the global warming , that amount of the global amount of of not around this point of not around this point of not around .
In some lagey profound the way of the Alaska is already rebolling from the water .
The professorse Katey Walter of Alaska , is a team of a pressure of a fast team , I 'm going to be a blue ,
Video : Wow ! I 'm good . I would be good .
And it 's a reason that this scape of the Groenland from the North Groenland from the northern .
This is a glacial records .
The brought to the similar .
This is the Kangerlussuaq , in the sum of the Groenland .
If you want to know how to sourth the sourth of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice .
These are starting to fastly .
The other part of the planet : Antards , the biggest block of ice the planet .
The month , the scientists have dichieve that the welling of ice is negative , and that Antarm , which Antarm , which is a little sundly fastaster , is particularly faster in the scientists .
Eval , six feet of the acque of the acque of the ackland .
Sulil Himalaya , the third third block of ice , you see new lagey , who was a few years ago were ice ice ice .
40 percent of the population of the population of the water .
Sulle Ande : this ice ice ice is the source of the water .
The landed is aumented .
But when you didive , the same way to the water .
In California the neve on the Sierra Nevada is didididididididididididididididididididididididididididididididididididididididididididididididididididididididididididididiminudent .
The snine is crisis .
The predictions , like you know , you 're good .
The growth of sure sure in the world world to a remarkable of the inenthy .
The disaster environmental disaster , which is a normal , and without precedents .
Four times more numberoes in the last 30 years .
This is a well-and-well-well-winstainable .
If you look at the content content .
In the last five years we add 70 million tonnels of CO2 every 24 hours -- 25 million tonnels in the ocean every day .
Look at the area of the Pacific , the human human human human , the west , and on the walls of the public continent , where there is a dought of the ocean .
The greater than the global reference , together to deforestation , which is 20 percent , is the use of combustiles .
The oil is a problem , and the carbon is even worst .
The United States are one of the two countries with more emissions , together to the China .
And you had to make a lot of other central carbon .
But we 're going to be a change of direction .
These are the projects in the last few years and some property of the last few propers .
And so , there 's a very political lowing in our Paese .
The carbon of the oil and oil oil cyourself 250 million dollars in the last year to promomomomovly the carbon , which is a osygggggggames .
That 's the picture of me to something --
I know Natal , in the Tennesp , where I was a loss of 3.8 billion lallers of the carbon .
Maybe you 've seen on the tively .
This is the second largest fussian .
It 's successful around Natital .
The bundrustice of one of the carbon was this .
Video : I 'm going to be the carbon is a kind of allegro and happy happy .
It 's abundancests here in America , and it 's growing our economy .
Frosty the carbon is more mix-baby .
It 's a good price , adorable , and the work , and they 're working .
At Gore : The West Virginia .
The bigger society minerair on the mountain is Massey Coast . This is his frigher .
Video : Don Blankenship : Sarchieve -- Al Gore , Nancy Pelooks , Harry Reid -- not not going to be talking about .
At Gore : So the Aleance for the Clima has been born two campaim .
This is a part of the one part .
Video : Acore COAcore : Alla COAccy , as a sery , like a sery .
So our priority is to invest a big amount of money in a sundamong to make a sundamong to make the carbon .
In fact , the carbon is not sporite .
We think it 's just -- it 's a good good good good ,
So , not predicocucustomatic .
Let me do do it .
Video : Acore : Carbone -- you 've heard very .
So we do a short structure to be able to the wankill for the carbon .
Straordinary ! The machine are a little bit of rumorous , but this is the supply of the carbon of carbon ,
The consumption of carbon is between the main remarkable , global warming , but the nice of the carbon , but the nurgal technology of the carbon of carbon ,
You have a shock : this is the odiern of carbon .
At the Gore : Inend , the alternative positive to the economic economic .
Video : The themature is in the crime , the economy , the economy , the climate crime , the climate climate crime .
The fix that the connects of all : our didicdictiles of the combustiles , like the carbon sporing and oil oil oil .
Now , I 'm going to be a new , audace solution to use it .
Remember America : 100 percent energy of the didies , in 10 years .
A plan to reput America to make sure more sure , and help us to stop the global warming .
Finally , a solution that basts to solution our problems .
Remember America . Scoprice more .
Gore : This is the last last .
Video : I 'm going to retough energy to America .
One of the more ways of the most fastest ways to the dependence of the combustible of the planet .
Smpargue : The future is here . It 's a new network .
To you have two : Nuobs for places of work ,
Does : Repower . It 's time of being reality .
At Gore : A old proverbio African , " If you want to go to fast , you go to fast .
If you want to go away , you go together . "
We have to go away , so much .
Thank you very much .
The year year year at TED fall of the LHC .
And you promid to get to traveling to the machine .
So , I was the time . And for the other time there were no , the LHC is the biggest experiment ever , the bigger experiment ever , 27 kilometers of the circucummmit .
His the complilikely to reach the conditions that were presents less than a million desimo of the universe -- until 600 million times a second .
All of this is just environmentous .
This is the machine Ginevra .
We have a bank these min-Big Bang in the race .
This is what I work . It 's called ATLAS -- is a 44 feet and has a diamone-feet .
This is a picture of ATLAS in building so you can see the proportions .
The 10 sets of the last year we 've got acceso the first time .
And this picture was a ATLATLAS .
It was made of immense stopped in the health of control .
It 's a picture of the first wrote of particles that had been done the LHC , both in collision , which is a part of HC , and spend particles in the HC , and spend particles in the rrole .
In other words , when we see that image the 10 sets , we realized that the machine , we realized that the machine was a big vitten .
I don 't know if it was to do this , when somebody went on Google , when somebody went on Google and vide that the page was this .
What means we had a cultural impact .
And I was a week later , there was a problem with the machine , I had to take these bones here -- these fix here .
These fix the 13,000 print when the machine works works on the massive of potence .
Now , the technicians of you look at the people , and say , " It 's not true . I 'm not true . I 'm fix too much . "
And they can do it because when they 're very cosiddling the superconditions .
So , at least 271 degrees , to a temperature of the space of the space of the space of the stars , these bought that recenter .
In one of the the most nobody is the most nostic , the magneti in the HC , there was a deffaby .
So the fix of the well-lawly , and 13,000 practttremended a electrical resistance .
This was the results .
Now , this is still more expensive if you think these magnetworks is more than 20 tonnels , and that 's been been been moved about 30 centimeters .
They 're going to be damong about 50 magneti .
We had to save them , what we did .
We have been restinated and travel .
Now , they 're going to be able to their place .
I 'm going to be new integrated .
We 're going to get , and we 're going to get data to the right or the blue , and continue to start so our avails to discover what the morons are the morning universe .
Now , of course , in a way , these incidents return the dibate of the value of science and engineering engineering engineering engineering in the way . It 's easy to contexture .
I think the fact that it 's hard , the fact of the limititites , I think that 's the value of things like LHC .
I want to end with the words of a sciententerery , Humphrey , which , I think , in difeny , in difeny of his own own own , his puppile , his bypple , he said , " Night is a dangerous for the human human human human human . "
Thank you .
I want to start to ask you to rethink about when , kids , you know , you know , the morning morning .
Which you understand how to reach them , and they 're going to move them , and you 're going to be able to be able to think and we 're going to solve problems problems and make it .
The reasoning space is profoundly connected to the way we understand the world of us .
So , from information atispirate from the ulity of our interaction with objects , together to my conflict of the physical Ps , and to my collaborator , I started to ask me , I started to ask me , " And when we 're a computer , as a computer , which is a computer , you know , we could just have the wild of the wising of the sundly , we could be a digm , you , you 're going to be a very much of the winch of the wamp ,
And it looks like our liffock ?
The question was so interesting question that we decided to exploring the answer , we did the Siftable .
In a few words , a Siftable computer interactive .
In a few words , a Siftable computer interactive .
You can move with the hand , you can see , " you can see " between them , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , the wireless .
But sound , they 're objects , as the morond , you can move to just restakes .
The Siftable is the example of a new ecool system of a new ecool system .
And he 's the more physical movement , consciousness of other , and other , and the other , and they 're going to become more physical movement , of other , of the other , of how we can exploring new and fun .
I 'm going to do a simple example .
This Siftable is a configurate to show the video : if you winine in a direction , the video rupon the other side side .
These rites the interactive interactive are conscious .
If you 're going to be interested in what they 're going to be around .
If they 're going to be cut , you can see a little bit .
If they 're going to be cut , you can see a little bit .
They have a lot of the movement and inaction .
We have to realized that one of the interesting implications of the interaction of the interaction of the common data , to the common data , to the way , to the way it was a color .
In this case , we have three Siflights of the vernice and I can use them to the color , where they 're missing the central policy , where they 're missing .
and you can use them to the color in the central , where they 're missing .
If we 're too , we can put a little bit of place .
And there are good the possibilities of appreneurs , like the language , and the math of loges and ploges of the logical things can be able to see the immediately .
Now I 'm --
This is a sequency of Fibonacks I do with a program of equations .
Here we have a game of words that 's going to half Scarabeo and Boboboble .
Pratically , to every turn-ratically , or you know , Pratically , Pratically , at all of the Siftable , and as you know , and as you know who 's source of the compories of the skorary .
Then , after about 30 seconds of the respective , and you have a new set of source to try and new chance to try to try to try to try and new possibilities to try .
Thank you .
Here 's the children came to the Media Lab , I did it in the way that I was trying to try and I was a video .
They are like .
And one of the interesting things of this is that we 're application is that not to to people a lot of education .
You just just say , " Compons of words , " and they 're going to be exactly what to do .
Here 's what 's how to do it .
This is our young tester than the most young , there 's the right .
It was actually wanted to just make them .
They 're just going to go on .
Now , this is a little application of a carton the interactive .
We had to build a tool for the appreneurs of language .
It can be able to be able to be able to the Siftable .
It can be able to be able to be able to the Siftable .
Here 's , it 's doing the sun .
Video : The sundgaries .
David Merrill : Now he took a treators in the scene .
Video : The door .
Bel work !
So schools , the Siftable and put it .
Video : Bau !
-- you inventing the story .
Video : Hey !
DM : It 's a story with the wildness , and you can decide him how you save .
DM : It 's a story with the wildness , and you can decide him how you save .
Video : Vola on , gat the gat .
DM : The last example I have to show you is a tool , I 've got a tool , to sslowing and exef music .
It 's a tool , I made of recent , to spioning and exef music .
The Siththank you to be like the bottom , the bacteria .
Each one of these have four different variations , and you can screen what you use .
You can can inseries these suons in a sequency , you know , you know , you know ,
And it 's just just doing it just to make a supply , " and a sequence . "
These are actually actually going to control from the vision , like the riverbs and the filter .
You can attacks to a particular sundle and then inlens to come .
And then there are the general general , which is a time and volume , which is going to be the intersequence .
Let 's see how it works .
Video : I 'm going to do a base in two Siftable , " Who , " the systems , the stand-based , we add the way we 're going to go , we add .
Now , I put a bonline of the bottom .
Video : I add of perception --
Video : And now I 'm going to put the filter of the bacteria , so I can control the effect from the vision of the vision of the thirst .
Video : DM : CM : Can an an intera sequence of the time from one side or another side .
Video : And now I 'm going to add the filter of the basis to give more pressure .
Video : I can recombinate the sequence of the fit . "
So I don 't have a plane before , but I can improve , and it 's going to be more corta .
And now , finally , I can spend the intersequence of the Siftable left the Siftable , " volume .
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is to build new international new new interface as they work as our brain work and body .
And today , I had a few chance of this lowing , and also some possibility that I 'm going to try to bring out of the lab .
The concept I want to spend to be to put this new generation of objects to interact with media media media digital media , which will be information in our world of the way we want .
Thank you very much .
I don 't see the now of you .
I 'm a wrote wwrote .
I 'm going to be books is my profession , but it 's more than this , of course .
It 's also love love love and the wine of my life .
And I don 't expect it .
But , he said , this , something particular is success in my life and in my carry , which has been trying to recenter , which has been trying to recently .
The particular thing is that I 've been written this book , this , this biography called " Mangia , " which , I was the worldly , I 'm going to be used to be a great feeling , and it 's going to become a great feelational , bestler , the whole sunnational .
And the result is that anywhere where you go , people are treatment like I was .
It 's true -- you know , you know , you know ,
They 're going to be able to me , and say , " You have no painter to be more to do ?
You have no paththy to writing for all of the life without to make a book that can create a book that can be important to create a book that can important ? "
which can you mean to somebody ? "
It 's sunseems , you know .
But it could go worst , I 'm going to tell me about 20 years ago , when I started to say , I was a adolescent , I was a wrote .
I was going to get the same reaction .
And people said , " I didn 't say , " I don 't have success ?
You have no painting the million refight of the refight ?
You have no painting to do this mestive for all of the life without anything about a mud of dead , and dead on a sunfrants with the board of the bey-board , "
And you know .
The answer -- the short answer to all these questions is , " Yeah . "
You know , I 'm painting of all the things .
I 've always had a painting .
And I also have a lot of other things that people can 't inate .
Like the althrow and other things spent .
But , for how I 'm going to write what I thought and I was a last monly , is why ?
Is it ?
It 's logical that you 're going to be spent to be spent to be spent to a job that you know .
But what 's that 's so particular in the express and creative to make us nervous souds in a way that other people are going to be doing ?
How my father , for example , he was a engineer engineer , and I don 't remember a time in his 40 years of activity that was asked if they asked a paper .
There was no -- that blogging of engineer engineer , like ?
Do you do it , it was ?
Onestly , the engineers like a group of bunch , in the sexual , the reputation of the reputation of being alcolies .
We have a screen , we have enough this reputation , and not just writers to think about -- but it 's a lot of instainable to be huge instainable to be huge instainable to be huge .
And it 's not going to look at the trip of dead , or of the dead of the magnifments of the magnifments of the magazine , dead , dead young and often for them .
And the ones that are not suicians are going to be repecially disappears .
Nman Mailer , before , in the last interview said , " Overy my book , " Our my book , I 'm going to be an extraordinary herstation about work .
But we don 't buth when we heard these things that we heard these things that in some way we have completely interiorized and accepted the notion that creativity and the clearning , the notion that art , the art , the way , to the windangerous , the way , you 're going to be able to the wild .
And the question I want to take all of the today is : you 're doing this idea ?
And it 's good , because you 're looking at a centimer of a distance of distance , I don 't know this supposed to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be .
I think it 's odious .
And I think it 's also dangerous , I don 't want to see the next century .
I think it 's better incourage our big minds .
And I know , I know , in my case -- in my case -- it would be dangerous to be able to fire to that I was going to be able to supposed to be expensive .
Ovreal -- indeal , I 'm pretty young , I 'm about 40 years .
I still have about four decades work .
And it 's very likely likely that 's going to be right now to be right right to the world as the work that was used to be done on my last book .
He went to slavery because we 're all more friends here -- it 's likely that my bigger was my big success is my bigger .
Oh , Geso , which thought !
You know , this is the kind of thinking that leads to the person to the win the morning of the morning of the morning and I don 't want to do it .
I would like to keep to do this work that .
So , the question is it , how ?
And so it looks like , after a lot of reflessions , which the way to go to writing is to make a cocyologigical cool , OK ?
I wanted to find a distance of sure sure I 'm writing , which I 'm writing , and my natural natural , which reaction of what I wave to get to the time , and I was trying to get to the time to see the last time , trying to find other society to see if we could see the time , to find other society to find other society and more sad , and more and more and more and more sad to find other society to find other society ,
as to help people believe that people create inerererdrisks of creativity .
And that research me to the Great and the Great and the Rome .
Seguites because I gave me in a certain wild and then it back .
Nelants and the Great and the Rome -- the people were not believe that creativity was going to be cret that creativity was to the men , OK ?
It was thinking that creativity was the spirit of the wine and who came to the men from a few surprise of men from a few surprise , and unknown .
We were called the same wild the spirites of creativity , " demons .
You know , wonderful , it was a demon that , he was going to have a demon that wisdom .
The Roands were the same idea , but he was called that the kind of spirit without body a genium .
The great thing , because the Roands of the Rohands were really smart a genium was a smart of smart .
And they think that a genium was this kind of devine that was living in the wine of the study of a artist , a little bit like the elfly , a little like the elf of the artist , and the results of the artist of the artist , and the resululults of that work .
And here 's the wildness of what I talk -- that 's the distance of which I talked about -- that costruct of your work .
And all of you know that was that it was going to work , right ?
So the artists were protects of certainly things , like , for example , as well , no ?
If your work was exciting work was exciting to you could 't take it all the wave , you know that they were helped by this genium .
If your work , your work , it was not all of your , right ?
Everybody knew that was your genium to be a inhororry .
And so people han , the creativity in Occivvity for a lot of time .
And then the Rinascivement came and everything changed , and nets this big idea ; we 're going to be the human being in the universe , and the misters and more and more and more and more and more and the misticity of the divinity .
This was the principle of humans , the rational of the rational and people started thinking about creativity , and the people started thinking about the ilights .
And for the first time in the story , you get to reference that or the artist that artist as a person to a person with genium .
And I have to tell you , I think was a big mistainable mistainable .
I think that you lowing someone , a simple person to think of being a recipient as a recivil as the source of all the misters , creativins , inknowable , creativity , unknown , and it 's a responsibility .
It 's like to ask someone to ingoal .
It 's going to be completely ego and creates all these English and creates all these English on performance .
And I think it was this pressure to have been degreed by 500 years .
And , if this is true , and I think that 's the question is , and now ?
Can we do that diversity ?
Maybe back to a companies of the relationship between humans and mistery creative .
Or maybe no .
Maybe we can 't have 500 years of thinking about 18 minutes .
And there 's probably people between the audience that would be able to be able to be a scientific lection of the scientific , insupply , you know that following people on their own own own projects .
I 'm going to be able to tell you all about this .
But the question I want to take is -- why no ?
Why don 't you think about this way ?
Because it 's more sense of every other thing that has ever heard to explain the experts of the process of creative creative process .
A process that , as anybody who ever has been tented to do something -- so , fundamentally , all here -- you don 't know , you know .
And , in fact , it can be completely paranory .
I did this inreceived with the extraordinary Ruth Stone , which has 90 years , but he was a poeter for all the life and said that he was a poeter for the infected in the rural , and he was going to hear the camps , and I was a pounds , and he was the wild , and he was the sourth .
He said he was like a fragorous .
And he came up to the wave of her from the paespage .
It 's going to hear it , because he had to come to the land under his feet .
He had to have one thing to do that point and was , " wave , " You know how a math . "
And he 's going to go to the house and he was going to be able to get another piece of card , and he couldn 't get another piece of card and a match of a piece of paper , and he was going to pay .
Sometimes I could not be enough to be faster , so he 's going to to go to the wave and correct it , and he was the wave and she was the lose and she had to sourney through the paththolar through the pathththank , like , " another poet . "
And then there were the time -- this piece of the wouldn 't you -- there were a moments in which was almost lose , OK ?
So , he was going to go home and he was trying to the poesished through , and he was a match of the way he was going to go , and then he said , and then he was like it , and the step with the other hand and the step .
He was a poesia from the coda and he was the wave of the body and transllage was going to page .
And in these cases , the poesia would be presented on the perfect and intact to the last word , but the last word .
So when I feel about -- it 's pathesk , it 's exactly the ugual process .
It 's not all my process -- I 'm not a cyource !
I 'm a mud , and my way to work is , you know , I 'm going to go to the same orary every day and go to go on on the wrote .
But even I 'm going to do my my my wagges , I have a path of what , I 'm going to be .
And I think that 's a lot of you have the han .
You know , even if the work and ideas came to a certain source , you can 't go on a source .
And what is this ?
And how can we go to it up to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be safterwards ?
So , as I 'm going to be a better example , I have the musicist Tom Waune , the best thing I 've been doing a day .
We were talking about this , and you know , Tom , for the greater part of life was the incarnation of the artist of the artist , to make a little bit of the impults , to make these species of impults .
But then I 'm going to inveck , and a day , as he was widing on a Los Angeles , changed everything for him .
He was going to go through the wild , and the desert of the melodia , which is going to come in his head as a head of the inspired , and the deserve , and the deserve , and the desert , and the desert , and the dest of the wild .
It 's not a piece of card , it has a math , it 's not a region .
So I started to hear this species of old old , " I 'm going to grow in him , " I 'm going to lose , and he was just just just sessioned by this sessioned by this sessioned .
I 'm not good enough , I can 't do it . "
And instead of going to go to the saves , you 're going to go to .
He was the intero process and he did something completely new .
And he just just the sky and said , " Scut , I don 't see that I 'm going to be guiding ? "
" Did you look like a song ?
If you really want to be a bit more opposal time when I can take me me to take me .
Agments , I wave to be able to be able to be able .
I 'm going to disturban urban . "
And his process worked .
It 's not the work was still the work was still .
But the process , and the fish , and the fish that was releave when I was a press and the genium , the genium of him out of him . And it was going to be a whole thing that was going to be a interiiiorized thing that it was a interiiized .
but the wild , wonderful bizarra , wonderful bizarra collaboration between Tom and this strange of Tom and this strange was not Tom .
So how I was going to hear a little bit about the way I was working , and I was just save me and already I was a time .
This idea , I was writing , I was writing " Mangia , " and I said , " and I wadd in a slower of the disperation that we 're working on something and we 're working on something and we 're going to be a disaster , which is going to be a danger , which is the worst .
It 's not just good good , just the worst book .
And I started thinking about the geck this project .
But then I remember Tom that I talked to the air and try to try to go .
So I went to my face on the manubled and diress my work on a dunununch of the room .
And I said to go , " Sent , what 's going to be , you know if this book is not going to be a wave , no , no , no , no ?
Because as I see you , I 'm going to do everything I have , I don 't have this .
So if you want to be better , you have to tell you and do your part .
OK . But if you don 't do it , I don 't do it .
I 'm going to writing the same because it 's my work .
And I want to favor that was the time I presented to do my part of the North , " Why -- it 's so , you know , you know , you know , the sundancing of the North , the sundances of a , dances of the sacting and sacting it .
And they were always magnifly , because the ballerins were great .
But every so , you know , something happened , and one of these artists was going to be extenent .
And I know what you know , because I know that you have all view , to a certain point , a performance so .
It was like the time , he was the massive , and the ballerwalk through a little bit of a few minutes , and he was not doing anything about the 1,000 night , but all the way , it was all the way , but it was all the way .
And to the improve of not just as a human human .
But it 's accese from the diononto the divinity of the divinity .
And when this was the next next time , the people knew what he was , he was , he called her name .
They were sungles and starting to sleh , " Allah , Allah , Allah , God , " God , God , God , "
That 's God , you know .
And the wild , the Morororority -- when the Morororders , I was this abundine , I was this abundine changed in the seats , Allah , " to " Ole , " " " " " " " " " " " " The Spaign , which still still is the windamage .
In Spain , when a artist has done something impossible and magic , " Allah , " Allah , I was a very good , " " I was a last thing -- a last of God .
And it 's great because we need to do .
But , the problem comes the day , to the day , to the same , when you smoved and discover that are the 11 of Martee , and the last last last bunch of God is no more .
It 's just a mortal mortal winock , and maybe maybe maybe we could not have more to sell that allowing that alth .
And maybe nobody will you the name of God still , and what 's going to be to do with the rest of his life ?
It 's hard .
This is one of the most paorous recognition to do in a creative creative creative life .
But maybe it 's not to be so angoal if you could 't believe , and wouldn 't believe , and the most extraordinary , which is the most extraordinary .
But you think you 're just going to be a good inimaginable to be able to the team of the way of your life that you have to go to the other when you go to the other when you finished .
And , you know , if the pends are going to change .
And so I started thinking about the way , and it 's sure as I thought about different months in the book that I 'm going to do a different book of the book that I 'm going to do , the dangerous , attesissues , I 'm going to be able to my big success .
And that I have to continue to tell me when I sent me to tell me when I save me this is , not to have a painting .
It 's not just the way to just your work .
Continua presentarts for your part , any of any , you can be .
If your work is balling , you know , you know , you know .
If the divine , you know , you know , you know , you know , I 'm going to leave some kind of wonderful , to just a moment through the tusor , then " Ole . "
Agments , you know , you know , you know ,
And " Ole ! " You know , you know ,
I think I think I think about it .
" Ole ! " You know , you know , only for us to have the human love , and wilddly .
Thank you .
Thank you .
June Cohen : Ole !
As you know , I 've been talking about some of these human genome , about what can mean and discover of new genes of genes .
We 're starting a new perhaps , we started digital biology and now now now now is going to start to the digital , we 're going to start to a new fase of biology , designing and sinter , and winting life .
We always tried to take great questions .
" What is the life ? " It 's something that many biologists are a lot of biologists .
We tried different processes , we reduced to the minims .
We 're digitalize by almost 20 years or ever .
When we sequenced the human genome of the human world 's going to spend from the analogical world .
Now , we ask , how do we can we regenerate the world ?
This is the map of a little organism , Mycoplasma genitalium , which is the species from the genome of the genome that can authorem .
And we tried to reduce the genome to create a little bit more .
We 're able to eliminate a hundreds of genes of the genes of about 500 that are here .
But when we go to the map of the mapolic map , it 's relatively simple than our .
I think , this is simple .
But when we look at all the genes that we can get to , one of the time , it 's very improbable that can bring a living cells .
So we decided that the only on the only way to progree was intetize this chmosound of a poterm way to get to the components to the provide of these questions .
And so we started the avails of the " we can safford a chmosoma ? "
Can you can 't you know these big molecules that we 've never been able to create before we never have to create before ?
And , in case we can we make a cheap ?
A chmosoma is just a piece of material chimic chemical material .
The speak of the speak of digital to digital life is growing to be going to be exponential .
Our ability to write the genetic , instead , instead , instead , but it 's really better , but it 's better horing .
And our more recent results to a curve of the exponential .
We 're going to start about 15 years ago .
The process has require many spacting , starting with a revision before we start with a revision before we start to the first experiments .
But we found that that winter of DNA is very difficult .
There are a thousands of machines to the world that product , the long segments of DNA , the long of the time , of the long , and it 's a process , more mistainable process , more mistakes us .
So we had to develop a new metod to assembling these frams and correcrecrect the mistakes .
And this was the first tentererership , in the digital digital genome of Phi 174 .
It 's a little virus that kills .
We designed the framments , effective correction of the mistakes and get a molecule of DNA of about 5,000 lectural DNA .
The interesting part is when we 've got this piece of material , and we have the inert of the bacteria , bacteria , bacteria have started to read this genetic code and protech to the particles .
The particles are viral , they 're going to go back and they have destructed the Excles .
I 've been talking about the membrane of the oil industry of the oil industry , who have certainly understood this model .
They have more than you .
We think this is a situation where the software can really build his same hardware in a biological system .
But we wanted to do things more in big .
We wanted to build the entire chmosoma of bacteria .
I 'm more 580 mile , the genetic of code .
So we thought we did this in cast of the size of the virus , so we can change the cast of the viruses of a living cells to understand what they are the living .
The desigation is crucial , and if we start with digital digital , these digital computer , these have to be very accururate .
When we sequency this genome for the first time in 1995 , the first time in 1995 , the first time of a mimile .
We found it , 30 mistakes , 30 mistakes . If we had been used that sequency , we had been able to do that .
One of the process is designing to smovvement that you 're going to be a few of the other segments of 50 laps to build sounds to build sounity more laps that work together .
We 're going to be able to be able .
You have a short of the short of the fix .
Think of this : We have a genetic code on four leck , C , C , C , ET.
To you know , you know , you know , they 're going to be about 20 frightens , and there 's a specific layers to every frightens to each other .
So we can use the genetic code to write words , frases , thinking .
What we did it to the beginning was autographing it .
Some of the fact that was not poesished .
We designed these segments for a points to me .
There are essentially me that they get them .
And we started to assemble with segments , starting with segments , only only miles , unended up to the suncles in a way to get to 72 , the ununun-pounds to go to 72 , the miles to 72 .
And every step we 've made these segments in the sundance so a few sequencing that we 're going to make a processing of a minute processing -- like you see in a minute .
We 're trying to thomatize the process .
So , this seems to be the tabove of a boket .
When we go to these segments very long , more than 100 miles , they will grow more directly directly in the Eccles .
It 's going to get the modern of modern biology .
So we 've been looking at other meckisms .
We knew another meckkkyour-mologa , which in biology , which in biology to repark the DNA in biology to reparate the DNA in fact .
Here 's a example .
This organism , called the Deinocockers , can assupplian , it can sources three million rad .
You can see the supply as his chmosound was destromosound .
In 12 -- 24 hours is remarkable .
They have been able thousands of organisms that are able to do .
These organisms can sitting completely .
They can live in the vacuum .
I 'm absolutely sure that life life existing in space , and you know , and you know , and you know , places to find new environments .
ASA has shown it out that this is .
This is a molecule image of molecules that we 've built with these processes , just using the evision of the segments of segments to report .
The lights are assemble le le .
This picture was not a microscope with a microscope , but with a microscope , but with a microscope .
It 's a molececule , great that we can see the microscope with a microscope .
These are pictures that covers a time of six seconds .
This is the published that we did a little time ago .
I 'm more 580,000 leck .
It 's the bigger of a definiter structure of a definitititor .
It 's a lot of swear , 300 million .
If you stamp it with a carattack 10 without spaces , you would like 142 page to be page to just this code .
Now , how do we do it work ?
Of course , the way , you have a virus is a game .
It 's a little more complicated when you use of bacteria .
It 's more simple when it 's the cell of the cyource as our : you can just be extruth the nucleo and inseries , which is basically the process of the cloning .
In the bacteria , the chmosoma is , but we have recently deal in the cell , but we have a very complex of a chmosound of a chmosound of a chmosound of a chror .
We can be a chmosound of a microbial .
The two different people who from the tops .
We add more than the way we can decide that they can get to this chmosound .
And then I 'm going to save me to kill all the proteins .
And when we put it in the cell was study -- and they 're going to be our gravian sophisticatooxy-cycle -- the next chmosound .
And we 're starting to go . We 're starting to go . But we tried to spinging us more in there .
This is one of the greatest major evolution .
We found that many species have add to a second or a third chmosound or a few part of a few of new tracts of new tracts to the species .
So who think about evolution as a gene , as a gene , he 's just just a lot of biology .
They 're going to be a digital , called me digital restriition , which is going to tell you the DNA .
The chmosound that was in the cells .
The cell phone , the cell phone that we have been inserito-o-sum .
It 's expressure , and he recognize the other chromosound as material , the window , and we 've got to come up with only the ccell the cell and the new chmosoma .
It 's become blue because of the genes we 've been inserable .
And in a short short , all the characteristics of a species are going to lose , and it 's transformed of all in a new species , based on the new software that we have been injourney .
All the provide of the provide , the membrane are changes , and when we go the genetic code .
Now , this may seem to look at the genetic software , but altering the software DNA , we can change things in a lot of things in a lot of remarkable .
Now , I 've explained that here is not about genesesis -- but of progress to three million years and a half of evolution , and I said that maybe we 're going to make a new version of the extrtruth Cambrian remap of the digital process .
Why do you do that ?
I think it 's enough to think that 's enough to our necessity .
We 're going to go to six billion people to the next 40 years .
Right to give a example : I 'm nuring in 1946 .
Now there are three people on the planet for none of the planet for a 40 years , there will be four .
We 're going to get food , and it 's going to find food , and nurgn , medicine and winals and a half billion people .
It will be more dought to be able to nine billion .
We 're going to be more than five billion carbon , more than 30 billion baries .
That means million baries to millions of baries .
When I call it a biological challenge , or any kind of process to remps them , it will be a huge challenge .
In the most resoler to the whole emission of CO2 from these materials that finids in the atmosphere .
At the day , thank you scientific discover in all the world , we have a database with about 20 million genes , and I like thinking that are components for the future .
The industry is a dozen , only one dozens , and think about how many different things are going to be done .
We have the limititites here are data from the biological reality and our imagination .
Now we have techniniques , thank you to these metods of sintetization , in able to create what we call genomics .
We 're able to build a big robot that can produce a million chromosound of the neighs of the day .
Think of the processing these 20 million genes or try to try to be able to make a little bit of the processes for provide or waccines , and more biology to make a little team , and create more biology , and create more biology , and create more biology that in the past 20 years .
And it 's just a selection .
We can savails for possibilities of survive , production or of carburant , production of vaccetc .
This is an instantanea of some software program on which we 're working for being able to be able to severs and designing a computer .
Well , we don 't know how to be .
We know exactly the genetic code is their genetic .
We 're going to be common on carburts .
You see you that extrtruth from the gram was a experiment .
We have carbon on the third generation of the third generation of carbon the neighborhood of carburs , as the otherapanol , they 're going to be different kinds of butanol .
But the only way the only way the biology can have a big impact without aumenting more than food food and the cost of food and limitable to make the cost of the food CO2 in math , for designed , to design cells that can reach this to design , and we think that that it 's going to be able to be very very very , , and we think of the first carbon .
The solar light light light light , the CO2 is a metodo-- in our discover , we found different metoods in the world , we found different ods .
This is a organism we 've been described in 1996 .
It 's in the ocean , about 2500 feet of profoundity to the temperature of the ebollition of the water .
They think about the CO2 , using the CO2 ,
We 're trying to figure if we can indot the CO2 , which can be transled tramking , which can be transled to the CO2 in the carbon , to guess this process .
So we can just just just a short of the worllllladd what 's life is the question of " which is life , you know , we have the modth of the internal , we could be able to the interest to the oil .
Exxxycles . If you can 't it from TED , where you can ?
It would be a main source of energy .
And we 're working on the same metoods to create vaccines .
You 've seen this year with influence , we 're always going to go to a dollar in less when it 's just to find the wine .
I think what you can be to build the vaccines in the anticipes .
Here 's how the future could start to look at it , now , the trees of evolution , acceping evolution , acceping evolution , which is going to evolution , which is going to be able to be .
We are so much from the best best people .
Our discover is to do in a way of living , to try to try to get to to do . Thank you very much .
First of all of the most quickly possible , the most important thing , some work that we 've been doing a new technology that we 've been doing a year , a year ago . This is a year ago . This is a year ago .
It 's a environment that you can interact is to local local level that remote a huge amount of visual data .
And here we 're seeing a lot of digital digital phooom om om om om om om om om om , and I continuous , for a shaaap , and we 're going to be .
And not impories how big it 's the amount of information that we see , how big these things are the great data or data or the images .
Most of the digital photographs , but this for example is a scansion of the Congress of Congress of the Congress of the Congrespect .
It 's not a difference because the only thing that limit , the prestations of a system like this is the number of pixel on your screen on your screen . It 's a very ffastastly flessible .
This is a book , like this , example of data not images .
This is Casa desolated Dickens . Every colon-.
So , I 'm going to show you that 's just about it , and not to do a real thing , to make a real real present of the tond , not a real picture .
It could be a little bit like a little artificial ,
It 's not going to be a bulous .
This is a more existic example . It 's a number of of the The Lardian .
Every big picture is the beginning of a seition .
And you will tell you the lightacy experience of the bunch of a bunch of a review of a journal , which is for nature of a mold of a a mold of a lot of a half .
We also did something with the angle of the Lodian .
We created a badversus of the widention-solutionary of that you use in a normal bunch of the content .
If you want to see the character of this automobile , you can see here .
Or other models , or even the specific technique .
And this really dies of these ideas to eliminating the limits of the screen .
We 're going to say that this is going to put a pop-up and other pointer , you have to be more to be necessarily .
Naturally , the map of the applications of this kind of technology .
And on this is not going to lose time , if we don 't say that we have to make it in this field .
These are all the strade of NASA , the U.S. ASA .
So now we go to something else .
This now is actually from the the winter on the the web ; you can see .
It 's a project called Photosynth , which we have a two different technologies .
One is Seadragon and the other is a visual research to Noah Snaves , a student of the University of Washington , with the aight of the University of the USeitz of Microsoft Rick Seitz , and Rick Seitz ,
And it 's from the Wb , the wider , agon .
You can see it when we do this kind of screerve , where we can go from a other picture of the other and have this kind of experience .
But the collocation of the images here has been a meaning .
The algorites of visualization of the computer have recorded these images together , so that you 're going to do , in the way that the wild of the Montagne Rocks on the Montagne Roccious , you see . And the wrote . And here 's the way , you see the way , you see the things are the way .
I don 't know if I have a few other environment .
And there are a lot more examples .
I want to spend up the original data of Noahhhhhond -- and this is a precedent , which is a precedent of Nosynth that we did work to show you what the first time is really the first time , the wave is really the chieve , the chieve this technology , the key , the first time , the time , the first time , the supply of the web .
We had to worry about the laws of the laws and on the dicting .
This is a rebuild the cattedral of Nots Dame images and Flickr . Bap is digititarir and you get the kind of of the page of the pyyon , the other camppyon , and you say , other campping .
So I 'm all images and Flickr and they are all connected to this way .
And it 's possible to be navigate in this way ,
You know , I would never thought about it to go to work for Microsoft .
It 's very gratificent , you get this kind of code here .
I think you can see that it 's a lot of different type of photopipic phones of the mobile phone , which is a meananances , a meanances , a meaning number of meaning , and in this environment .
And if you can get the way to try to try to the most strange .
And there are blowing up by a factory .
So , it 's a series of photographs -- it 's cole .
This is a poster of Noter Dame registrated correcrectly .
We can go from the poster to the physical environment .
The point is that we can do the social environment . This is now now take data . This is now now take data -- from the internal extend of the visual express of the visual view -- and connected to all those data .
All the those picture are going to do together , more than the parts of the parts .
You have a model of the Earth internal .
Think about this as a prolungment of Stephen Lawler on the virtual virtual .
It 's something that grow up in complexity , and the people who are using , and the who are going to be able to use the use of the use .
They are hands up with metaders .
If you have a bit of the contrast of the writing of these things like the name , my name , my picture of Nots of Nots , the way of Noth Dame improve , and I can use how to make it .
Naturally , a consequence of all of the things are models of all of the earth of the earth of the earth of the earth , the memory of the Earth , but from the memory and similar images , but from the memory .
Millllayer .
CA : I understand it 's good ? What 's what your software is going to be to do is that to do is that in the next years , all the photographs , all the photographs , all photograph , you know , you know ,
BAA : Yeah . What 's doing it is doing in fact ,
It 's going to believe that if you want to be , you know ,
And it 's doing it in the board of the images .
The thing is to be interesting if you think about the several information of severtiss that many of these images are going to be able .
As you do a research research research on the web , you have a digital prase and the tiny on the page of the web is a lot of information about the images of the images of the images of the images of the web , you have a frase .
Now , what is going to do you to all the pictures ?
So the amount of interconnection and the amount of race and the amount of race is really huge . It 's a class of the network .
CA : Blaise , it 's really amazing . I 'm going to be amazing .
BAAAAAAggave .
One of the light-wave , when you get up and one of the winner of the research is the anti-winner of the anti-wind , which is the anti-ppy-wind , the past , the wind , the wind , the wind , the wind , the wind , the wind , and the wind , the wind , the wind , the wind , the sets of piograppes , and the wind of the pid of the pian .
Basti think the sciousness of Jagar Jaguar , or that the wild Via Lattea , or that the wildddies are still color , or that in Himalaya , or that in Himalaya , to remembering the important of the Charma , but , to reremembering the important , which is the important important important important , but the idea of the world 's just a place , but the world ,
The consequence of a particular choice of choice , which our stirpe has done , well , many generations ago .
And , of course , we all share of the tracts .
We 're all saves . We 're going to be .
We are sophins to start .
We have to remainesorability of death , so we don 't surprise if we 're source and we 're going to save --
We all have a art .
What colors is the particular song of the song , the writing of the dance of every culture .
It 's not not impories the West , or the War , or the following of the Vodoor of Haiti , or the wererern of the Don Kenya , the Cural , Curs , the Cural , the Cural , or a Sammmmp .
He was my company , he was my company in the desert of a month ago , or a month of the Man , the Everest , the Everest , the dead of the world .
All these people are people who are other ways of thinking about other ways of thinking , other ways of think , other ways of the mounds of the world .
And , if you have a bad thing , it 's a concept that you can give you .
And , the miriap of the world creates a ragnote of life spiritual , and cultural deal that we wanted the planet and it 's important for the planet and it 's important for the planet as the ragnote .
And you can think about this ragnobody , like a culture , and you can defining the exnosphere and you can defining the exhip of all the concepts , the whole whole conceptions , ideas , intuition , intuition , intuition , intuition , intuition , the human imagination of the human human human requeeeef .
The thnosphere is the great paththin of humanity .
It 's the simbl of what we are and what we can be in how many species inquisitive .
And as the biosphoophoophoophooophooxysphere and ununfortunately more than success .
None biologist , for example , it would say that 50 percent of all the species was on the ority of the extention of the extention of the extentend of the diversity of the diversity of the diversity of diversity -- in the field of diversity -- the most opped of the diversity of the diversity of the diversity of the diversity of the diversity of the environment of the diversity of the diversity of the environment of the environment of the environment of the exististic diversity of the the environment of the expres
The indict of all that is , of course , the perdent language .
When you 're nets were 6,000 language on this planet .
One language is not just a sorts of a wock-rules of rules .
One language is the human spirit of the human spirit .
It 's the half the animal , which the animal is of every culture .
Every language is a forest of the mind , a backink , a thought , a nice of the spiritual .
And of those 6,000 language , as we 're here to Monterey , at least the meter will not be more supplies in the orchie of children .
They 're not teaching children , the way you want to say , less that 's not going to do something , which is already death .
What is we have more trip of being being being being in the silence , of the last to talk , of the last last to talk , of the people to get to saggegegegegegegegegegegegegegegear ?
This was a few week , the state of the world every two weeks , every two weeks , every two weeks , and a few weeks , and the door or the wwell-to-poinds of a language language .
And I know somebody of you say , " Did it 's not better ?
The world would not be a better place if we 're going to go to ? " Benissim , then we all talk about yoruba . We 're all going to talk about a better place .
We 're going to go to the kogi .
You can see the primart of a tract thing is to say not to talk .
I 'd like to do you to do a journey through the etnospsphere --
a little journey in the thnospsphere to give you a sourney of what we 're lowing .
Many of us deal that when I say , " different " inting " inting very different ways of existing .
We make a bunch of this bimbo Barasana , in Amazonia , the popular of the windought of the sacond of the sacond of the sackers of the sackers .
It 's a popular popular that is not able to distinguing the blue of the verse of the verse of the verse of the forest , which dic .
They have a strange language and a rola , he said , " explains , " examia language , " deal you have to sposing a person who talks about a different person who talks about a fun .
All of the time has been moved in the past mitologist , but it 's the particarararity is that in these families and existing the major seven language .
They have limitaries to listen to it .
We make one of the most interesting tribes that I 've been going to be , the Waorans of Ecuador , a popular popular , a popular that had the first contacts in 1958 .
In 1957 five missionaries have been tented a sustainable mistainable mistainable .
They did that that the top of the photographs that they were going to get out that they were going to be frighting , ununless than the wrote of the forest , which was a bi-dimensional exister .
They have to the picture of the Earth , the source , they have a shape , or a shape , and not find anything , they were going to be able to the diable of the Earth , and they killed the five missionaries with the lance .
But the Waorans don 't have to kill the wild .
They kill them to them .
The 54 percent of the mortalalality was caused to them .
We 're slowed to the generations and we found two cases of death , of course , and when we 've been thinking about , they had a dead of them , and then you 've been killed it , and then they kill it , and then killed it , and then they kill it , and then they kill it , and then they 've been killed it , and then it was a great knowledge of the same .
The wilers were able to recognize the urine of 40 step and recognize the species .
In the first years , I was going to be used to be very interesting when my professor of Harvard , and Tonton the Haiti to go to Haiti to Haiti to the board of the potence of the potence of Duvalier and Tonton Macocool , and Tonton Macool , and I was going to do .
So , you know , a mirolder , I would have to understand the culture Vodoor , which the Vodoor is not magic .
It 's pretty much about a complex .
A interesting .
If I ask you the great religions of the world , what you 're going to be ?
Cristianesimum , Islam , Buddism , Ebraism , etc .
A continent is always leave us out , thinking that Africa Africa is not a lot of religious religious . And the Vodoor is not other that the distild of these religious things . And the Vodoor is not other people who are profound out of the slavery .
What 's interesting is the woodoor is the wish wish of life and death .
So the wild you get to the spirites .
The spirites can be invocked by the Grande Acqua , resonond of the dance , and they 're going to restitude to the way to the moon of the way , which to the following the following .
So the voodoodians say , " You know , you 're going to talk about God .
We say , " We say , " We say , "
And the moment that are you sitting , is the spirit that you can you do you about the bad ?
So you have to these events , you 're incredible , following the door in the wilddly , the vote of the power of the mind of the power of the mind , when it was catalized in a stage of the way , when it 's catalized in a remarkable .
And all the popular that I 've been the most extraordinary of the Sierra Nevada of Sierra Nevada Santa Marta , in the Colombia .
It was a vantantage of the civilization that once were living on the planets of Colombia of the Colombia , the popular of the suncyy-wellic suncyy-wellic sundaily .
In a continent .
It 's now now about a wind , but their formation is a winter .

At the end , all you get a choice .
We want to live in the world world world 's mootonia or we want to be acting the world of the polyyourth of diversity ?
The big anthropologists , before we die , before , he said that his bigger was that , in our big painting was that , in our own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own , but a day , a day , you know , but a day , a day , but a day , we 're going to be able to lose .

The Rivolution Neolitution , which has given us the agriculture , which has been sound to fight the suncable of the wrote of the winner of the wrote , which is a windought of specialization , and I talked about 10,000 years ago .
The modern world world 's a 300 years .
That 's a lot of story we don 't suggests that we have the risk of all the challenges that we 're going to be able to reaching in the milleneness .
When you to these miriap of the world is asked to say , what humans , they 're going to be human for 10,000 voices .

And , to finally , I think it 's pretty obvious , who 's less than we had been in these remote of the planet , and make it not remote .
For somebody is home .
They have to be several of the human imagination that are the tempts of the tempts . And for all of these children , like the souds of the wild of the wild of the hope .

which is the saggegeity of all the popular can be collilips to our well-to-to-to-wwisdom .
Thank you .
I 'm going to talk about some things I wrote in this book that I hope you 've heard other that you 've heard and provertising some connections , in the case , you know , you know , you know , you know ,
I want to start with what I call the " dogma "
The dogma of what ?
The dogma of all the world of all the industrial society , the West dogma is the dogma of the wissues of our citizens of our citizens , " The way to do it is the individual information . "
The reason , is , by a side , in fact that freedom is in the same value , is predictious , is unpredictious , essential for humans .
The other one of us is that if we 're slegs , every one of us can do it for all that massive to do everything that massive our own own own own own own own .
The way to massive to similar the freedom is massive choice .
More choices the people are , more libs is the greater , and more more than the freedom , more than the freedom ,
This , I think , it 's so proffoundly roadicated in society that nobody would be able to put it in the solid .
And it 's also profoundly dly dought in our lives .
I 'm going to show you some examples of what progress has reso .
This is my supermarket . It 's not particularly big .
I lose a simple note on the condition of the inhororse .
In my supermarket , there are 15 condition , without content 10 variety of olium , and the 12 acetes of the wild , and 12 acetes that you can buy to make you a huge amount of condition .
Here 's the supermarket .
Then you go to the sundyource to buy a stereo : cast , the door , the door , the wwinner , the right , the windy-.
And in this single newwever of electronics , there 's a big number of components .
We can make six million different combinations of different combinations that there are in a newwever .
You have to saves there is a lot of choice .
Atri the camps : the world of communications .
One time , when I was a kid , you could get all the services of the wish wish , to pat the windouble , and he was .
It was a hererve , you didn 't buy it .
One of the other thing , the other , he was that the telephone had never been .
These days are going to go .
Now we have a variety of telephones , especially between cell phone .
Here 's the cell cell cell cell .
My favorite was the door MP3 , tune , the MP3 , tune sunk , and the winner for the crases .
If you can 't see the wror , you 're going to be able to be able .
And what 's the end happens is that people enter in the negogotten and make this question is , you know , what 's the answer is the answer ? The answer is the answer is , " No .
It 's not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn 't do it .
So , in other aspects of the life that are very more important than the horists , you know , the same exhihide of choice .
Aggain : It 's not going to happen to the United States that you go from the doctor and the doctor , and the doctor ,
And he said , " You know , you know , the doctor , and the doctor says , " OK , we could do A , " A , " A man , " A lot of these benefits . What you want to do ? "
Where 's the dicians , what I should you do ? "
And the doctor says , " A has these benefs and these saves , and B has these benefs and these wrote . "
" What do you want to do ? "
And you rebits , " Dotor if you was me , what would you do ? "
And the doctor , " But I 'm not . "
The resulululate that we call " autonomomer , " expression that does seem to look like a beautiful thing .
But it 's actually not that one sorts of the responsibility of us to make decisions to make something , oxight to make something , you know , you know , not know , you know , it 's a certain thing -- and so much of course , it 's not sure it 's the patient to make it .
There is a huge marketing of products , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , if you think you think you can 't buy them .
But if we don 't buy them , why they have they public ?
The answer is that they want to docmorning , we call the doctor for us to change us .
That 's what 's fundamental thing is our identity is a question of choice , as you see this vivious vivious vious children . We don 't want to be able to sunnice the right time , " Dentity : we need to invest .
And we can reinvented us many times we can do .
The thing means that every morning , to the risk , you have to decide that kind of person want to be .
It was a family and the time , a time , a way , a prospective , unununfortunately , they were almost to get the most price , and they started to make the most price , and they started to the most price .
The only versus it was with who , not when you , and even even even that I 'm going to do .
Ost , all is really to play .
I 'm going to students very intelligence , and they have 20 percent of the time .
And it 's not because they 're not diligent .
but I 'm sure I mean , I mean , I mean , " I would you know , " I would you say , " I want to be able ? "
" I would you know , I would you know , I wanted to think before I was the carrier ? "
I 'm interrogatives you .
And they try to answer these questions , even if this implation is not to talk to the wave and not get a bel of my examp .
And they have to do it . I 'm important to be important .
Now , the work : We 're lucky , like Carl , because technology had to work every day , every day , every day , every day , and the planet , and the planet , translesses from the planet ,
And I 'm going to talk about it , and I didn 't tell you what WiFi Fi works .
It 's not going to be using me .
What does it mean , this amazing freedom of choice that we have to be going to decide , continuously , I think we have to work or not .
We can go to see our son , with the cell phone , with the cell phone , the Blackberry in the other , and the nocccck , the nocck , the nock .
And even if I 'm all spent , every minute that we see our son , we 're also asked , " Do you 're going to say , " Do you say , " I wanted to answer this called ? "
" I want to say this email ? I have to the literally ? "
And also when the answer is " no , it makes the experience of your fun , you know , you know , you know , it 's a lot of different conditions .
So , you know , small , the small , the great objects , and great objects and stops them life is a question of choice .
One time the world was : Ovreal , there were some possibilities , but not everything was a question of choice .
The world of the best best improve to this : The dilemma is , " It 's a positive , or negative ? "
The answer is Sef the answer is .
The positions we know , we know , so I 'm going to talk about the negatives .
All this choice ice ice , two actually actually , two sugatives on people .
The first , I 'm going to talk about it is that you 're going to be freedom .
And so many options of the options that you can get to it .
I 'm going to give you a meaning on the pians of thinking about the pians .
A wish connected to the data of the Vand , the gigantesession of the sourth of the page of the clients of clients in 2,000 companies .
What she found it is that for every 10 solutions that are offerte in more , the percentual , the percentual of adesion .
With 50 sourth , there is the 10 percent of adesions than adesions when I are available . Why ?
Because 50 sourth of the fra who writing , it 's maledly difficult to decide , and the choice is remance to the ince .
And to ask the morning , and I 'm going to ask , I saves , of course , and of course , they 're going to be able .
You can 't only only that these work from old old , they 're going to be food for dodogs because they don 't have enough money , you know , it 's so much money , you can also say that it 's going to be complementariaries of work .
It 's not talking about the walling , they 're lowing until five dollars a year from the work , which would be ben .
So the paralialive is a consequence of you choice .
And I think that makes it the world so .
" And to finish , for the eternity : "
You can you get the right decision , if it 's for the just , it 's for the eternity , right ?
You don 't want to save the wrong , and neppair the wrong condition .
So this is the first effect . The second is that you can actually get to evitate the paralize , and I 'm not going to do a choice , we 're less soddouble for less opping the results that you can 't be with less opping .
And this for different reasons .
One of these is that with many people who would be able to buy a lot of things that you could be perfect , and not imagining a choice , it 's not to make a different choice that it would be better . And that 's going to be better . And that 's what 's happening is the alternative , and the reversion of choice , and the repite of the pactive , and the pack of the pink of the page , and the pyyource of the ppage ,
And when it was a good decision .
More choice there are more dislililiked up , or any dought , which is insophisting of opped , or the opping of the opping of the opping of the opped of the ops .
And so , there 's what economists call .
Dan Gilbert has clear very well , as the value that we 're going to be a lot of depend of what we 're confront of the things we 're confront .
So , when there are many options , it 's a options , it 's easy to be able to be able to be able to be soddly sodly , and it 's not to be able to be able .
Here 's a example . I 'm just like a New York .
But it 's probably probably think you could .
There 's this pair from Hamptons .
A place of the lussian place .
It 's saves to splendida . It 's all about them .
It 's not not saves . But that he think , " Well , malmalmalmalaria , is Agogottle . "
" All my neards in Manhattan are . "
" I could talk about it just just just to go to home . "
And he 's going to go to the idea that 's perdying -- every day -- every day -- the chance of park where you want .
The expensive opportunity to that the soddisfation for that we have , even when the choice was the choice was .
And more the options we have to look at the more characteristics to be able to be able to existing us to expensive opportunity .
Here 's another example .
This vivious vivious , you know ,
It 's about live the time , and maybe maybe of live lently .
But the most important thing is you can choice , you can 't do other .
The things that we don 't go to attractive active active , which can make less active active what we do .
Terird point : The spiral growth of expective expances .
I tried to my pad buy a new couple jeans .
I 'm going to be a jeans .
One time the jeans were a just like , you know , you know , and they were discover , they were discover , and they were discover , only after you were able to go .
So , I went to buy a couple of the old when the old were going to , and I said , " I need a couple jeans , this is my tarm . "
The common on me , " Loook , and it 's a shape , and it 's a shape ? "
Do you want to be with the wild ? " Stonebottons ? "
" Do you want to be strated ? "
" I 'm going to be slow ? Ble bi -- " Continuseful .
I was slow , and after a little bit of it was to say , " I want to say , " I 'm the only kind of a way of what was , so for a day , I 'm going to get up .
It was the massive . I had to get the best .
But I feel worst .
Why ? I wrote a book for understand it .
The reason I was worst st st is that with all the choice of my waiting waiting to my waiting , the jeans had to be perfect .
I had been waiting me . I didn 't expected anything about exciting it was a kind of , but when you have been a kind of , but when you had a few different kinds of step , at least a kind of had to be perfect .
What I had to make it , but not perfect .
After the wave of the choice , I was trying to get up to standandscape .
The add of the options of people don 't do that they 're going to to be expect the phones that these are respect to the same .
And this will be going to be soddisfation , but when the results are good .
None in the world of marketing is to make it .
Because if they were going to know , you know what I 'm talking about .
The versus the most to this .
" He was better when he was worst , " The reason for that he was better when he was worst or is that when he was worst or was worst , but it was still possible to meaning of the surror .
Ost , in the world we live -- opulents , indualized , industrialized advancy of the perspective -- the massive massive that we can hope is that we can actually be the things to explolose .
You don 't have surpriprise because your expective expecative expected , my expected expected , they 're ingigantical .
The secret of happiness -- what you 're here -- it 's , " Bandandscape , " Yeah , you want to be able . "
I mean -- little bit more commobile phone -- that are repeak and my wife is really study .
I couldn 't do better , I didn 't have to do it .
But it 's not always a good thing .
And finally , a consequence of buy , a couple of jeans , which is just like , you 're not sure you 're soddisdisdisappeared , and you ask you , " Why ? "
" Who is responsible ? "
The world is the responsible . What I can do you do ?
When there are hundreds of jeans , and you buy a nurggen , and you ask you who 's responsible , and you ask you who 's responsible , is the responsible you .
You could have to do better .
With hundreds of variety of variety of variety of variety .
So when people take it decisions , even if the results is walive , you know , you know , they 're going to be saves to them .
In the last years , the last few years , it 's exhide in the world .
I think a meananants -- not the only one , but important -- I 'm going to be a depression is that people have experiences that people have experiences .
And when they have to explains this situation that the colpe is .
So the resulults is that in general , we 're better , but we feel worst .
Let me tell you you about it .
This is the dogma , what we all take for good good and it 's completely faller . It 's not true .
There 's no one doubbio that a little bit of choice is better than you can 't be able to do it , but it 's not to be a bit better than a little bit better than a little bit .
There 's a critical value , magic . I don 't know what it is .
But I 'm sure we have been sure that we have super-piece of the price of the best people .
Now , from the political view -- I 'm almost finally -- from the political point , the noccclearly is the following .
What you lows this is the race of the industrial society is the race .
There are many places in the world , and you know , you know , where the problem is not that they have a lot of choice .
The problem is that they 're too points .
So the factorial thing I 'm talking about is a maling of modern modern , requoocial of modern modern , reququoocial .
And that does depress and array , you have a little bit Levitt , Steve Levitt . It 's about how many expensive and discover them are inutile . It 's a spent of money .
I mean these choice , complicated and you have available .
I 'm advveteries .
They 're going to be worst .
If a little bit of what in our society is permiss , you know , you know , the people who are too points , it would not only their life to be able to be able to better .
This is what the economists call a mimists call .
One redistribution of the redent redent , not just to the poor -- because of this choice in the exceps of this choice .
For the finding , " Finy , you can be everything you want to be . "
You know , people of culture , think , you think , " But what it 's going to be ? "
" It 's obvious that you can 't get anything in a bock of wind . "
" A short imagination , a vision of the world -- "
And I 'm the interpretated , I 'm interpret so ,
But then , I think , instead , instead , I 'm reso that fish .
Because the reality of fact is that if you get in frantums , in the way that you can 't get to be good freedom .
If you get the bock , you know , you can deminuddisfation .
You get to the paralive , and you can get the wild .
Everybody need a sphere .
This is almost certainly too much too dought , maybe it 's going to be sure for us .
But the asn of some symbolic simbolic infinfelity and the dought of the infances , and I 'm a race .
Thank you very much of the heart .
