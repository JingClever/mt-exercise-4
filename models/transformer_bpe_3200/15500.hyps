Last year I showed these these slides of the arttic slide of the arttical arttic , which for almost three million years , had the size of the 48 continental .
But this subvalue the gravity of the problem because it doesn 't show the spent of the ice .
The artical caloth glacial calots is , in a certain sense , the clean of global climate system .
You expanies of the winter and you get the summer .
The next slide will be a rapidly carrelated to the advents of the last 25 years .
The payayers have been drawn in red .
As you see , you expand until the blue wall .
That 's the ice in the winter , which is ritired of summer .
You can see that the cosidgen ice , of five years or more , is like blood , which is like blood , which is like blood .
In 25 years , it 's past that .
This is a problem because the retively heat at at the land land land land around the world , where there are huge amount of carbon congelated that , the main the metane .
I 'm going to the totality of the inatmospspect from global warming , that amount of global warming could doubled , so that we don 't go around .
In some laghi , a little profound in Alaska metane is already rebling from water .
The professorse professorse Chatey of Alaska is a team of a latest la-based lap .
Video : Wow ! Al Gore : Lee is good . The question is if we 're also going to be .
A reason is that this termal exchange the Groenland from the northermal .
This is a glacial records .
The landed had never reached livels .
This is the Kangerlussuaq , in the west of the Groenland .
If you want to know how the sun of the sea level for the pace of the ice of the ice of the raference of the sea .
These rentertainment are very quickly .
The other part of the planet : Antarctical block of ice on the planet .
The month of the scientists have dikey that the bilaneous of ice is in negative , and that the Antarctde , which pogers on some islands , is particularly particularly rapid , is particularly faster .
It 's six feet feet of the level of the aceful , like in Groenland .
Sulla Himalaya , the third largest block , you see new laghi , which few years ago , a few years ago .
40 percent of the world population is rich half of the potable water from that the chievement .
Sulle Ande : this glacier is the source of the potable water of this city .
The laid was increased .
But when it diminues , the same happens to the water water .
In California , the nenow on Sierra Nevada is diminuity of 40 percent .
The idrices are in crisis .
The predictions , as you read , they 're good .
The growth smart in the world leads to a remarkable respect .
The environmental disasters are increasing a rim outside and not precedented .
Four times more numbers in the last 30 years , I precedented 75 .
This is a whole whole sunsustainable .
If you look at the context of the historic context if you can see the consequences .
In the last five years , we added 70 million tons of CO2 every 24 hours -- 25 million tons in the ocean every day .
Look at the area of the oriental Pacific , from the American American American , towards , in the west indden continent , where there is a radical rooms in the ocean .
The major of global warming , together to the deforestation , which is the 20 percent , is the use of fossil fuel .
The oil is a problem , and the carbon is even worse .
The United States are one of the two countries with the most emissions , together to China .
And it was proposition of building many other carbon carbon carbon .
But we 're now now now now now a way of the way .
These are the anullated projects in the last few years and some green propowers .
And every way , there is a political lovely in our country .
The carbon industry and the oil is the oil , they have spent 250 million dollars in the last year to promote carbon , which is a oxymon .
That image I remembered something --
Natal , in the Tennessee , where I live , there was a 3.8 billion light-carbon dioxide .
Maybe you saw the news .
This is the second largest fllow of last last fllow in America .
It 's happened around Natal .
The puzzle of one of the carbon industry was this .
Video : Sweet the carbon is a kind of allegro and happy .
It 's abundant here in America , and it 's grow our economy .
Frosty carbon is more and more and more and more and more .
It 's good price , I 'm very good price , and they 're going to be the stypend .
Al Gore : From here is a lot of the carbon of West Virginia .
The biggest mineral society on the mountain Coal . This is his administrator . This is his administrator .
Video : Don Blankenship : I 'm going to have clear -- Al Gore , Harry Reid -- they don 't know what they 're talking about .
Al Gore : So Alleance for the Protext of Clima has launched two campaign .
This is a part of them .
Video : ALergy : Alla COALergy , we see climate change as a serious serious serious change .
So our priority is investing a big amount of money in a bunch of money in a bunch of public and confused the truth .
In fact , carbon 't sporite .
We think we think it 's cleaning -- it 's also a good profum .
So , not pregnant of climate change .
Let 's do it to us .
Video : Acore : Carbone , you heard a lot of speak .
So we did a lot of a lot in a structure at the building for the pulit carbon .
Straordinary ! The machines are a little rumorous , but this is the sound of carbon technology .
The carbon consumption is between the main cause of global warming , but the remarkable technology of carbon carbon carbon technology that you see changes everything .
Do you look at this : this is the pulit technology of carbon carbon .
Al Gore : Infinally , the alternative alternative , the economic issue and the national security .
Video : The America is crisis , the economy , the national security crisis .
The river that connects all : our dependence from fossil coal combustible , like carbon carbon oil and oil oil .
Now , there 's a new , audace , audace solution to use it .
Resesime : 100 percent of the energy , in 10 years .
A plan to remit to ret America to work , and make sure more certainly make it more certainly , and help stop the global warming .
Finally , a solution that bastes to solve our problems .
Repower . Scoprite more .
Al Gore : This is the last .
Video : How about redate energy to America .
One of the most fast ways of the dependence of the combustible that killing our planet .
Comparse : The future is here . Very , a new energy network .
Comparse : Novi investment for baby jobs for bits .
Some of course , reports America . It 's time to be realists .
Al Gore : A man man 's old proverbio says , " If you want to go fast , you go to fast .
If you want to go away , you go together . "
We have to go away , fast .
Thank you very much .
Last year at TED flead fton-on the LHC .
And promise to rate to travel you about how the machine works .
So here I 'm here . And for those that the other time , there were no , the LHC is the biggbiggest experiment that we 've been a lot of science experiment -- 27 miles of circummmmultiple .
His compask to rereretreating the conditions that were less than a billion than a second from the beginning of the universe -- until 600 million times a second .
All of that is just environment .
This is the machine under Ginevra .
We 're going to take these min-Big Bang in the relevator .
This is what I work is what I work . It 's called ATLAS -- it 's larger 44 feet and has a diameter of 22 feet .
This is a spectacular picture of ATLAS in building so you can see proportions .
To 10 settember of the last year we have acceso the machine for the first time .
And this picture was taken by ATLAS .
It was cause of immense festeggies in control .
It 's a picture of the first fascies of particles who did everything around the LHC , entking in collision , in collision , with a part of the LHC , and spread particles inside the refleck .
In other words , when we see that picture the 10 settember , we realized that the machine was a big victory .
I don 't know if this is this to do , when somebody went on Google and vide that the page was this .
That means we had a cultural impact beyond in the scientific impact .
At a week later , there was a problem with the machine , had to have these fili here -- these fixes here -- these fixes .
These fithem 3,000 print when the machine works on the massive of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the massive .
Now , the technical technical , they will look at the river and say , " it 's not true . They 're very smothern too . "
And they can do it because when they 're very cosiddets are very cosiddets .
So , at least 271 degrees , in a temperature , in the space between the stars , these fili can bring that rate .
In one of the giuntures between the most of the most novemile in the LHC , there was a defect of fabrication .
So the fili are surgering to do slightly , and the 13,000 print suddenly met a electricity .
This was the result .
Now , this is still more impressive if you think that these magneti fish more than 20 tons , and that have been moved about 30 centimeters .
They have been wide about 50 magneti .
We had to take them , what we did .
We repressed and we were there and traveling .
Now they 're now now now now now they 're all on their place .
By the end of mark the LHC will be again .
We 'll access it , and we expect to get data , and we expect our data , and we continue so our adventure to discover what are the morons that are the morning in the universe .
Now , of course , in a certain way , these are reaccending the dibate of science and engineering in the value of science and engineering in the front of science and engineering . It 's easy to confuture .
I think the fact that it 's so hard , the fact of going beyond the limits , I think is the value of things like LHC .
I 'd like to end with the words of a English scientist , Humphrey , which , I imagine , in difense of the income of the experiments of his pupillo , his pupille was Michael Faraday , he said , " Nist is so dangerous for the progress of human mind how the report of science is that we don 't have a whole new worldangerous , and that we don 't have a whole . "
Thank you .
I want to start asking you to rethink of when , children , you 're doing coon the morning .
Whereas you get them as reach and make them , take them and move them , and you 're actually going to be able to think and solve problems and we actually have to think and solve problems .
The space reasoning is deeply connected to the way we understand a lot of part of the world around us .
So , from information usually inspired by the usual objects , together to my physical consulent , together to my consulent Patch , and my collaborator Jeevan Kalanithi , I started asking , " And if we use a computer , instead of having the only of the mouse as a computer , we could actually track in a dest dest , we could actually track it in a dest , with an information with both hands , we could actually make an information with both hands ,
and how do it ?
The question was so interesting that we decided we decided to explore the answer , building Siftable .
In a few words , a Siftable computer is a great interactive computer as a biscope .
In a few words , a Siftable computer is a great interactive computer as a biscope .
You can move them with the hand , they can see " between them , " to feel the right motion and they have a screen and a radio wireless .
But most most most of them , are physical objects , like the morning , you can actually move it .
By is the example of a new ecosystem to manipulate information to manipulate digital information .
And as they become more physical , consciousness of the movement , of other , and as they become more physical , consciousness , consciousness of how we move , we can explore new new and different estyle and extraordinary interaction .
I 'm going to start with some simple example .
This Siftable is configurate to show video : if you inclin a direction , the video ran , the video ran , if you inclin the other side .
These retreactive rats are consciousness of others .
If I affive them , they 're interested what they 're around .
If they 're surrounded , they can act a little bit .
If they 're surrounded , they can act a little bit .
They also have their movement and inclination .
And then we realized that one of the most implications of the interaction was that we can use communal management on data , for example , " a color like it was a liquid .
In this case , we have three Siftable , as a great-bunch and I can use them to the second in the one , where they mix .
and I can use them to the current color in the central , where they mix .
We 're too too , we can reput it a little place .
I 'm also beautiful possibility of apprentice , like language , mathematics and games of logical , where people can try things , and see the results , and see the results of the immediately results .
I 'm now --
This is a Fibonaccount sequence that I do with a theme of equations .
And we have a game of words that 's in the half of the Scareo and Boble .
Pratically , at every turnal turnal reach a letter in case about every Siftable , in every By , at every turnal turnal in case , and when you try to understand that he control on a a dictable .
And then , after about 30 seconds remissing , and you have a new labor and new possibility to try .
Thank you .
Here 's what the children came to the Media Lab , I did how to try them and I was a video .
They liked a lot of them .
And one of the interesting things that kind of appliance of this kind of application is that not to give people a lot of education .
You just say , " Compons of words , " and they know what do .
Here 's what 's here to other people who are trying to do it .
This is our headlines , there 's the younger heads there , right .
It was actually wanted to do it .
They only are morning in the morongs , for him .
Now , this is a application of a interactive carton .
We wanted to build a tool for the language of Lui is Felix .
It can put new characters in the scene , sending the Siftable .
It can put new characters in the scene , sending the Siftable .
Here 's what 's doing is doing the sun .
Video : Sun is sun .
David Merrill : Now , he took a herrill .
Video : The araneous treat .
Bel work ! Yeah !
So , eightopy and put the neighbors can interact with the characters --
Video : Bau !
-- invent the story .
Video : Hao !
DM : It 's a very open story in the open , and it can decide how you swant .
DM : It 's a very open story in the open , and it can decide how you swant .
Video : Very straight .
DM : The last example I have time to show you is a tool , made of recent , to spioning and exeguing music .
It 's a tool , made of recent , to the campioning and to do music .
The Siftable here are aging from the ground , the battery and battery .
Each of these has four different variations , and you can choose that to use .
And we also also put these sounds in a sequence of understanding your pleasure .
And it 's just doing it by doing a soundable , " and a sequence . "
These are actually actually actually control from the vial , like the reverbero and the filter .
It 's a particular sounds and then inclabor to travel .
And then there are the general effects as time and volume , that we apply to the intersequence .
Let 's look like it works .
Video : We 're going to start a base in two Siftable sequence , " We 're going to put it in a series , we add the other base .
Now I put a basis of the bottom line .
Video : Now , I add percussions --
Video : And now I 'm going to put the filter in the battery , so I can control the effect from the vial .
Video : DM : Can 's fast to the internal sequence time by one side or another .
Video : And now I 'm going to add the lowest filter to give more expression .
Video : DM : Can you recombine the sequence of the flight .
So I didn 't have to do it before , but I can improvisate it , make it longer or corta .
And now , finally , I can spend the whole sequence of the British British , " volume . "
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is building new interfaces more and more sounds like our brain and the body .
And today , I had time to show you one of the results of this path , and also some possibility that we try to bring out of the lab .
The concept I want to put you is that is coming up this new generation of design objects to interact with digital media , that will take information in our world that we want .
Thank you very much .
I don 't see the now of talking to you all .
I 'm a writing .
I 'm going to criting books is the profession , of course .
It 's also love and the fashion and the fashion of my life .
And I don 't expect that it can change .
But , I said , something particular , something recently in my life and in my career , who took me to recently the whole thing with this work .
The particular thing is that I recently written this book , this biography called " Mangia , " The " Mangia , " which , diversely from my worldwide books , for some reason , in the world and became a great feelational feelational , bestyle .
And the results is that everywhere now , people are treating me as if I was conconstructed .
It 's true -- that was conconconconconconstruct .
They 're all on me , I 'm all worried and say , " Do you can 't do it than doing better ?
You don 't care of continuing to write for all life without being able to create a book that can be able to create a book that can be able to do a book that can be able to be able to create a book that can be able to think about somebody ? "
that can be important to somebody ? "
It 's cercertainly , you know .
But it may go worse , in the one of the time I remember that more than 20 years ago , when you start to say -- I was a adolescent -- I wanted to be a wrote .
I was on the same reaction from the fear .
And people said , " Don 't you to have successful ?
Do you don 't care that the law of the refuse killed ?
You don 't care of doing this to the whole life of all life , not that anything about it out and die on a a cumulation of dreams with the pile of lost .
So , you know .
The answer -- the short answer to all these questions is , " Yeah . "
Yeah , I 'm fear of all those things .
I 've always had fear .
And I also fear of many other things that people can 't inguess .
Like the algae and other things .
But , as I writing what I thought and I 'd ask me last is because ?
Irational ?
It 's logical that everyone who has to expect to be spent from a work that was born to do .
But what is there is so special in the impressive creative , is what 's about health is so much about the other people in a way that other carrier don 't do ?
How father , for example , he was a chemical engineer and not remember one time in his 40 years of activity that was asked if he had fear to be engineer ?
There was never -- that was that block of the engineer John , how does it go ?
It didn 't work that , you know ?
Onestly , the chemical engineers like group have not certainly , in the centuries , the reputation of being alcolized maniacated to be alcolized maniacated .
We have a scritter , we have enough this reputation , but creativity of every kind , we have this reputation of being huge instainable to be huge instainable .
And it 's not the other that you look at the triad of the magnifetime of the creative worldwide of creative dead , they die young people and often .
And also the ones that you don 't seem to be really disfaced by their dones .
Norman Mailer , before he died , in the last interview said , " Every book killed me a little bit more " an extraordinary affermation about the work of their life .
But we don 't buy when we hear this stuff that we 've heard these things so long that we 've been interiorized and accepted the notion that creativity and suffering are in some way laught-way and the art , at the end , in the end , it will always always always the angoal .
And the question that I want to take all of today is : you agree with this idea ?
It 's good this thing -- because it 's looking at a hundred distance to me not good for this supports .
I think it 's odious .
And I think it 's also dangerous and I don 't want to see the perpetuated in the next century .
I think it 's better encourage our big creative minds to live .
And I certainly know that , in my case -- in my situation -- it would be very dangerous to start fuse to that suddenly , suddenly dated the circumstances in my career .
It 's true -- I 'm really looking at , I 'm pretty young , I have about 40 years old .
I still have about four decades of work in me .
And it 's really likely that everything I 'm going to be right now right now , and it 's been right now going to be judged by my last book .
I 'm slaveat because we 're all more or less friends here -- it 's likely that my big successful successful is my big successful .
Oh , Gesus , who thought !
You know this is the kind of thinking that leads a person to start to start bing gin the nine of the morning and I don 't want to do it .
I would continue to do this work that we work .
So , the question is it , how ?
And so it looks like , after many reflective , that the way to work to continue to write is to create a psychological costruction , OK ?
I had some way to find a distance of security in me , that I 'm writing , and my natural anxial anxion which reaction is going to be able to get it . And I was trying to go through the last year , trying to see other society to see if they could have better ideas and better and look at the time , and then they could have better ideas and more sane and more sane , and I 'm going to find other society to see if they could have the best ideas and more sane ideas and more sane ,
how to help people believe creative creative people are creative to management of creativity .
And that research has taken me to the Greek and old Rome .
Seguitem because I 'm given in your eye and then back .
In the ancient Greek and ancient Rome -- the people don 't seem to believe that creativity came from men , OK ?
And it thought that creativity was this rewatch depend and that came to men from men from a few distant surprising and unknown , for distant distant reasons and unknown ,
The green divine called these spirites are the demand of the demons .
Socrate , wonderful , he believed to have a demon that elargggizety from the far away .
The Roands were of the same idea , but called the spirit of the spirit of the idea .
which is great , because the Roands don 't really think that a genius was somebody particularly intelligent .
And they believe that a genius was this kind of devine that was living in the muri of an artist , a little like the elpho Dobby , and that came out of the About , and that came out to the work of the artist work of the work of the argue of the argue of the work of the argument of that work .
Exectional -- here is the distance of which I talk about the psychological costruction that protected protected from your work .
And they all knew that was what it worked , right ?
So the ancient artists were protected by certain things , like , for example , the way too narcible , no ?
If your work was exceptional work , you couldn 't take it all the deserve , everybody knew that the waves were helped by this incorporate .
If your work failed , it wasn 't your work , right ?
Everybody knew that it was your genius to be a incapable .
And so people han conceived creativity in Occccient for a long time .
And then the Rinastion came and everything changed , and all this big idea ; we put the human being in the center of the universe over the universe on all the way over the universe on the universe of the universe on the winter of the divinity .
This was the principle of humanity and people started thinking about creativity , and the people started thinking that creativity came from the idivide .
And for the first time in the story , it started to referred to this or that artist as a genius rather than a genius .
And I have to say , I think it was a big mistake .
I hope that I have to somebody , a simple person to believe that we 're like a reciplent as a recipient , the essence and the source of all the misters , creativity , and unknown is a very big file , and so so big physical , and you know , and so much of human becomes too big to give the fragile of human beings .
It 's like to ask somebody to ingoal .
It 's destauring and destake , and creates all these ingestizes on performance .
And I think it was this pressure that I 've been this pressure in the past 500 years .
And , if this is true , and I think that is , the question is it , and now ?
Can we do it ?
Maybe I 'm going to go back to a more advantical understanding of human relationship and mystery creative .
Or maybe not .
Maybe we can 't cell 500 years old old .
And there 's probably people in the audience that would read the scientific sosports of scientific news , in the news , you know that following people in the right projects .
I 'm not convinced you all about this thing .
But the question I 'd like to take is -- why no ?
Why does it not think about this way ?
Because it has more sense of everything that ever heard of the explanation of the creative process of creative process .
A process that , as anybody who ever tried to do something -- so , basically , all here -- you don 't compories to do something -- so , you don 't compored .
And in fact , in fact , it can sometimes seem to be completely paranormal .
I did this inagainst recently the extraordinary poetry Ruth Stone , who has now 90 years , but that was a poeter for all of life and said that during her childhood in the rural Virginia , working out in the rural Virginia , and he felt it , inside , if a few days , when a few of the landscape .
He said that it was like a frageous tracy .
And that was rotoling towards her from the landscape .
He 's been going to hear it , because he was trying to get the land under his feet .
He knew that I had one thing to do at that point and was of , " With the way . "
And it 's going to correct home and came from this poetry , and it wouldn 't have to get a piece of card and a math , and a math enough enough , and it 's caught it , and it 's going to be on the page .
Sometimes he could not be enough to be enough enough , so correct and the correcrect and the correcreceive and the poetry , and it was going through and she lost and he would continue to rotolar through the landscape , to try and rotolar through the landscape , and she would continue . "
And then there were those times -- this piece of not dimentichy , I 'm not going to say , OK ?
So , he was running home and was trying to go home and a few days , and he was a married married in the while he was going , and then said , that was how if it was sallon on the other and steffed .
And it was the poetry from the coda and reput it in his body and transclumn on the page .
And in these cases , the poetry was presented on the perfect and intact but the contrary , but the contrary , from the last word .
So when I felt thinking -- it 's landscape , it 's exactly the same same as my creative process .
Not all my creative process -- not a construct .
I 'm a mulo , and my way to work is ; you know , you get me to see the orary horarian and work and pass on the goal .
But even I , in my headlink , I 've been calculate against that thing , sometimes .
And I guess that many of you you have the han done .
You know , even though the work and the ideas and the ideas came from a certain source , you can 't know , honestly saperforms .
And what is this thing ?
And how can we relate it in a way that we don 't lose the head , but rather , rather , that does it remain healthy ?
And as I mean , the best example I have the best example I have the musician musician , which I interviews different years ago for a day .
We were talking about this , and you know , Tom , for the majority of life was the incarnation of the injectumented in the time , to try and control , domining these species of impults .
But then I 'm going to calculate , and a day , when he was driving on a Los Angeles , changed everything for him .
He was going to fast and everything from a tract sent , this little framtion of melody , who comes in his head as the inspiration , and the deserve and the deserve , and the desider , but it doesn 't know how how to take it .
It 's not a piece of paper , it doesn 't have a math , it 's not a math recorder .
So I started to hear this kind of old old old old species , " I 'm going to lose , " I 'm going to lose , and I 'm going to sell .
I 'm not good enough and I can 't do enough . "
And instead of going to go into the panic ,
He was the whole process of mental process and made something completely new .
And he just looked at the sky and said , " Scell , you don 't see that I 'm driving ? "
" Who looks like a song hour ?
If you really want to exists , you want to get a bit more opporting one when I can take care of you .
And so , you 're going to importantly somebody else today .
You see the Leonard Cohhen . "
And his process of working changed after this .
Not the work was still dark work , the work was still dark .
But the process , and the fish that was reclumn that was recut when the genius , the genius that was out of him out of him , and the genius that was going back from where , realized that it didn 't have to be a whole thing and remain .
but it 's a peculiar , wonderful bizarre , wonderful bizarre , a conversation between Tom and this strange and the outside .
So how the story is how the story started to change a little bit about how I was working and I was always save and I 'm always save .
And I 'm saved when I was writing " Mangia , Prega , Ama , " and cads in one of those cave of the disperation where we 're working on something and we can 't start thinking about something and we can think that it 's going to be a disaster , which is going to be the worst book that 's worst book .
Not just bad , right , right the worst book wrote .
And I started thinking about giving this project .
But then I remembered Tom who talked about the air and I tried .
So I went down my face on the gave and demandresses my common to a vacuum of the room .
And I said , " Sents , what , what , both , we know that if this book is not going to be brilliant not interventially colm my , no matter ?
Because as I see it 's now now now , I have no longer than this .
So if you want it to be better , you have to tell you and do your part .
OK . But if you don 't do it , you know what , you don 't do anything .
I 'm going to write the same because it 's my work .
And I 'd like to favor that was recorded that I 've been presented that I 've been presented to do my part of the world , OK -- it 's so , OK -- sacres in the Northern Africa , the sacres of the light , dancing and sacres that went on and on the alba .
And they were always magnify because the ballerini were professionals and were really great .
But every while , rarely , something happened , and one of these artists became actually transcendent .
And I know what you know about what I talk , because you all of view , a performance so .
It was like the time , the balleren , and the ballerine walked through a kind of labor , and it wasn 't doing anything different from solior , and it was all about it .
And suddenly , not appeared as a human .
But it 's accese from the divinity of the divinity of divinity .
And when this happened , when this happened , the people knew what was called the name .
They were the hands and they started to dotar , " Allah , Allah , Allah , God , God , God , "
That 's God , you know .
Curious note -- when the Morinvaser the south of Spain , present this habits with them and the pronoundine , " Allah , " " " " " " " " " " " " " Ole , " , " which you can still feel in the street .
In Spen , when a artist did something impossible and magic , " Allah , " Allah , " Bllah , " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " Alah , " An " Allah , " Alah , " Allah , " Are , " Allah , " Aluch , "
And it 's great because we need .
But the problem is the day after , for the ballerine , when you sweet and discover that are 11 in Martedday morning and the last of God , and the last of God .
It 's just a mortal with gran bad bad , and maybe it can never be able to sell to make that altitude .
And maybe nobody will you the name of God still as yra , and what does it have to do with the rest of his life ?
It 's hard .
This is one of the most paintings to do in a creative life .
But maybe it doesn 't have to be so angoal if you can 't believe , as much as you can 't believe , and that the most extraordinary expected than your being from you .
But you know that they 're just given you to prested from a source of this team of the team of your life that you have to go to somebody else when you finished .
And , you know , if we think about this everything changes .
And so I started thinking about it , and it 's certainly how I thought I was a different time in the book that I 'm going to report , the dangerous , I 'm going to be followed in my great successful successful .
And what I 'm going to continue when I feel I feel eleved by this is , it 's not not fear .
It 's not going to be there .
Continua presentargue for your part , any can be .
If your work is ball , you know , you 're ball .
If the divine , I 'm assurd to you , I 'm going to leave a few kind of wonderful , for a moment through your effort , then " Ole . "
And you 're sorts , you do the same dance .
And " Ole ! " at you you 're .
I think and I was dealing it .
" Ole ! " at you , just for human , even for being human and testing tals from a tal tal tali to make you continue .
Thank you .
Thank you .
June Cohhen : Ole !
As I 've talked about some of these projects on human genome , what can mean and the discovery of the new new new set of genes .
We 're starting a new path : We started digitalize biology and now starting from that digital code we 're coming into a new phase of biology , design and we 're going to go into a new fase .
We always tried to ask for a big questions .
" What is life ? " It 's something that many biologists I think have been trying to understand vararies .
We tried different approaches , we reduced to the minimum .
We 're digitalizing from almost 20 years .
When we sequenced the human genome was to spend from the analog of the world of biology in the digital world .
Now we ask us : we can regenerate life , or create new life from this digital universe ?
This is the map of a small organism , Mycoplasma genitalium , which is the species from the smaller genome in the lab .
And we tried to reduce the genome of the genome to create one more little .
We can eliminate a hundred genes of genes about 500 that are here .
But when we take a look at his metabolic map , it 's relatively simple than our .
I think that 's simple .
But when we look at all the genes that we can get together , one at the time , it 's very improbable that this can bring a living cells .
So we decided that the only way we decided that the only way to progret was synthesize this chromosoma , so we could actually modify the tops to bring some of these questions .
And so we started the adventure of " Can we can be sychromosoma ? "
Can the chemistry to confeed these big molecules that we never never have to create before ?
And in case we have a calculate , we can make a chromosoma ?
A chromosoma is just a piece of inert material .
The speed that we 're able to digitalize life is growing to reverse exponential .
Our capacity to write the genetic code , instead , progrecially , but it 's improving .
And our most recent results the results of the exponential .
We started more than about 15 years ago .
The process of requires , starting with a biothetic revision before we start the first experiments .
But we found that synthesize of DNA is very hard .
There are tens of thousands of cars in the world that make small segments of DNA , over 30 to 50 lectarness and it 's a degenerative process : the most error .
So we had to developing a new method to assembly these framments and correcrect the errors .
And this was our first tentative tative tative information of the digital genome of the Phi of the genome of the Get genome of the Go I174 .
It 's a small virus that kills bacteria .
We designed the fragments , actually , actually , the correction of the error and get a molecule of DNA of about 5,000 lettes .
The interesting part is when we took this piece of inert material that we 've been inserted in the batteries , and we 've been going to read this genetic code and protection and viral particles .
The viral particles have been released by cells , they went back and they destructed the Ecles .
I talked about recent recent with the oil industry , and they 're certainly understanding this model .
They have been reverse than you .
We think this is a situation where the software can actually actually build his hardware in a biological system .
But we wanted to do the biggest things .
We wanted to build the whole chromosoma .
They 're over 580 miles of the letters of genetic code .
So we thought we made it in the size of the virus , so that we can change the casss of the virus , so that we can change the components of a living cells .
The design is crucial , and if we start with digital information in a computer , these have to be very accurate .
When we sequenced this genome for the first time in 1995 accuratattainty was a sustake for every 10 miles .
We found it , resequency , 30 mistakes . If we used that that we had the original sequence that we never had been able to do it work .
One part of the process is design segments , in the process of 50 land-up , and they 're going to have all the other segments of the other segments of making smaller work together .
We try and untable elements here .
You probably read that we 're going to read that we 're going to be blind .
So , think , we have a genetic code on four letters : A , C , C , G and Ts .
Three of those letters together codifeter , and there 's a specific order of reading , and there 's a specific order of reading for every frightening .
So we can use the genetic code to write words , thinking .
What we did at the beginning was self-doing it .
Some of them have been on the fact that it wasn 't poem .
We designed these segments to just just just a unique thing with me .
There are them that we repect them and put them .
And we started assembly assembly with segments , starting with segments from five to seven miles , unending , so to form sending segments of 24 miles up to 72 mile .
And we 've made these segments in abundance so that we 're trying to sequencing that we 're trying to create a very robustoking processing -- as you see in a minute .
We 're trying to automatize the process .
So , this seems the tabellon of a lowket .
When we get these very long segments , over 100 miles , the lowers , they don 't grow up in the Eccles .
It 's the limits of modern biology .
So we looked at other mechanisms .
We knew about another mechanism called recombination recombination , which in biology is usual to repair the DNA to repair the segments .
Here 's an example .
This organism , called Deinococcus radiodurans , can assume three million rad rad .
You can see in the sometimes square of the soma is destructed .
In 12 -- 24 hours is reached as as it was before .
There are thousands of organisms that they can do it .
These organisms can sit completely .
They can live under a vacuum .
I 'm absolutely sure that life exists in space , and you know , sorts of places to find new environments of water .
ASA showed it that this is .
This is a picture of the molecule that we built using these processed processed design , just using the labor design of the segments that we 've built up .
The lights assemble .
This picture was not taken with a microscope of electronic microscope , but with a microscope .
It 's a very big molecule we can see it with a microscope .
These are pictures that are a period of about six seconds .
This is the publishing we did a little time ago .
They 're over 580,000 letters of genetic code .
It 's the biggest molecule of a definite structure that we 've ever created from man .
It 's got a superior or molecular weight in 300 million .
If we 're going to stamp 10 without spaces , we would like 142 page to transcortation this genetic code .
Now , how do we work ?
Obviously , tramite a virus is a game from kids .
It 's a little bit more complicated when they use bacteria .
It 's easier when it comes from the eucariote as our : you can just get the nucleo and put another , that is basically the process of cloning .
In the paraine , the chromosoma is integrated inside the cells , but we recently demonstrated that we 're able to do a complete chromosoma from one , and to active it .
We clean a chromosoma partment from a microbial species .
The two are different as men from the topes .
We added some genes in the way that I can decide what choice for this chromosoma .
And then the skid with the audience in a way to kill all the proteins .
And when we put it in the cells was stupendomed -- and you will appreciate our suphotos -- the new chromosophisticatosticatomic cell .
And we started thinking that we couldn 't go beyond , but we 've tried to spinger us in the way .
This is one of the major mechanisms of evolution .
We found that many species have added a second or a chromosoma , and in a second chromosoma , added in a second thousands of new tracks .
So who thinks about evolution as a one gene and the time you have been modified in the biology .
There 's the ency called the restription of restription that I 'm going to say to digerate DNA .
The chromosoma that was in the cells that it was in the cell .
The cellphones that we 've been inserit--cell cell cell .
It 's expressed , and he recognized the other chromosoma as the summit as , has masticated , and we 've been suddenly with only cells and the new chrown .
It became blue because of genes we 've been blue .
And in a short leaves of time , all the characteristics of a kind of went to lose , and it turned out of a new species , based on the new software that we 've been sorted in the cells .
All the protects have changed , and when we read the genetic code , and when we read the genetic code of what we 've moved .
Now this may look at alchemy genetic , but altering software , but altering the software , we can change things in a very basically .
Now , I 've already explained that there is not talking about genesis -- but to start by three million years old and a half million evolution , and I said that maybe we 're going to create a new version of Cambriana , where they 're going to create new species on this digital process .
Why do that ?
I think it 's quite obvious when we think about our need .
We 're going to go from six billion and a half billion people in the next 40 years .
Right to give you an example : I was born in 1946 .
Now there are three people on the planet for each existent in 1946 ; over 40 years , there will be four .
We 're having problems now to find food , fresh water and clean , medicine and a lot of people .
It 's going to be more than doing it for nine billion .
We use more than five billion carbon carbon dioxide , more than 30 billion baries .
That means hundred million baries a day .
When we try to find biological processed , or any kind of process to replace , it will be a huge challenging challenging .
We have to realize all the way of CO2 emission of these materials that ended up in the atmosphere .
And now , thank discovered in the science , we have a database with about 20 million genes , and I like to think that are the design components for the future .
The electronics is only one dozen of about components , and think about how many different different things came out .
Our limits here are the data data from the reality and our imagination .
Now we have techniques , because of these rapidly methization , in order to create what we call the combined genomical genomics .
We can build a big robot that can produce a big robot that can produce a million chromosomes a day .
Think about processing these 20 million genes or to try to get to get these processing , and to make the processing , new vaccines , new vaccines , and we can change , thank , thank us , and create more biology now that in the last 20 years of science .
And it 's just a standard selection .
We can choice to be choice for the possibility of survival , or carbon production , or carbon production ,
This is an instantaneous instantaneous software programmed that we 're working on the computer .
Well , we don 't know how they 're going to be .
We know exactly what the genetic code .
We 're now concentrating on the carbon carbon generation .
You know , you know that I 'm going to extract thanol was a finial experiment .
We have carbon on on the third generation that are going to be going to be like the carburging carburants as the either either , like the either or different kinds of butanol .
But the only way that biology can have a big impact without increasing the cost of food and limitaren 't increasing the food would be transforming . And the availability to transforming the CO2 in matter before , and we 're working on the cell , and we think of that that we have first first first carbon generation in about 18 months .
The solar light solar light with CO2 is a metodo-- but in our discovered , we 've found different metods .
This is a organism we described in 1996 .
It 's in the ocean , about 2,500 feet of depth of the water .
They believe metane from the CO2 molecular as a molecular source of energy .
We 're trying to figure out if we can inchannel CO2 , that can easily be transformed to be transformed to tramite with the carbon , to drive this process .
So , a short pending that we could be able to increase what life is , " which is the basic question of " which is Noi , real eat -- we have the goal of repair the whole of the towards oil industry .
Exactly . If you don 't do it from TED , where you can ?
It would be a main the source of energy .
And we 're working on the same metods to to create vaccine .
You saw this year with the influence , we 're always back to a year and a dollar in less when it comes to find the waccine .
I think what you can change building vaccine , in ancient advvaccine .
And that 's how the future might start seeming , now , the tree of evolution , accelling the evolution with the synthetic bacteria , archy , and finally , the eucariote .
We are so from the best people .
Our purpose is to do it in a way of living enough to try to do it . Thank you very much . Thank you very much .
So , first of all of you , I 'm going to show you , the most fundamental work , of the new technology that we brought to a pretty good year ago . This is Seadragon .
It 's a environment where you can interact is in local level that remote with a huge amount of visual data .
We 're seeing a lot of gabyte of digital photos with a kind of zoom and continuous , for a very constant sloramics , and I mean the images like we want .
And it doesn 't matter how big it is the amount of information that we see , how big these collections are data or the images .
Most of the digital photographs , but this for example is a prostate from the Congress of the Congress , and recome into the gama of 300 megaxing .
It doesn 't make any difference because the only thing that the prestations of a system like this is the number of pixels on your screen in any time . It 's also a very flexible architecture .
This is a book , for example , not data ,
This is the Casa desolate of Dickens . Every colonna represented a capital .
And to show you that it 's just about it , and not images , we can do something like this , to see that it is a real real representation of the tbook , not a picture .
It may be a little bit artificial artificial to read a electronic book .
Don 't advice the advice .
This is a most realistic example . It 's a number of the Lardian .
Every picture is the beginning of a sex of a sex .
And it really gives you the pleasure and the becomes to the version of a magazine or a quotidian , which is for a molteplain , which is for a moltepling .
We also did something that with the corner of this number in particular number of the Lardian .
We created a higher advertising rooms -- much more than that we use in a normal advertising -- and we 've been in a normal puzzle .
If you want to see the characteristics of this automobile , you can see here .
Or other models , or even the specific specific models .
And this really shows some of these ideas to eliminate the limits of space on the screen .
We hope that that that it means to put a few p-up and other porcheries , not to be necessarily .
Of course , the map is one of the most obvious applications for this kind of technology .
And on this is not going to lose time , if we don 't say we have contribute to give them in this field .
These are all the streets in the U.S. sovister of the NASA 's 's been on the NASA .
So now we go to something else .
This is actually actually actually from the web ; you can go to see .
It 's a project called Photosynthesh , which combine two different technologies .
One is Seadragon and the other is a very interesting visual computers in the world in the world of the University of Washington , a student of Washington , with the aid of the UW Seitz of Rick Szi Szi Research . "
And it 's from the web , I 'm on the web , I 'm going to be on .
You can see it when we do this kind of screen , where we can go from a image to the other picture , and have this kind of experience to the last last last last .
But the space of the images here has actually a meaning of the images here .
The algorithms of visualialization of the computer have recorded these images together , so that corresponding to places where the images are all the near of the Laghi Blaghi 's 's been scacked -- you 're scacked . And here you 're scacked . And here you see the elements of a destable of imaging , and these things are all the rest of space or imaging .
I don 't know if I have time to show you some other environment .
There are some more space .
I want to go directly to one of the original data of Noah-- and this is from a previous prototype of Photosynthrotosynthesus that we 've done the first summer , to show you what I think is really the key key key to show you what we 've been looking at is really evidence that we put in the web . And it 's not necessarily evident that we put in the web .
We had to worry about legal aspects and forth .
This is a reconstruction of Notter Dame pictures of Nototprint , " Trr. Bap Noth Din Flickr and get images of the kind of magic field in the campus and on . On a lot of these arts represents a picture that is discovered is to the picture that it is discovered to this model .
So I 'm all taken up of Flickr and I 've been all connected to this way .
And it 's possible to navigate this very simpissive way .
You know , I never thought I 'd never thought to end to work for Microsoft .
It 's very gratifiying to get this kind of acaking here .
I think you can see that it is a lot of different fotocameras : from those of the phones of the phones to those of the SLR , a number , a meaning , put together in this environment .
And if I can , I try to try and those more strange .
Many are block by doing it , etc .
And in some part here is a series of photographs -- it 's cole .
This is a poster of Notre Dame registrated .
We can go from the poster to the physics of this environment .
The essential point is that we can do things with social environment . This is now taking data from the interal memory data , from the interal memory of how the Earth , from the visual view -- and connection to the whole whole data .
All those pictures become connected together , more than the sum of parts .
You have a model of the land that emerge .
Think about this as a prolunging of Stephen Lawler on Earth .
It 's something that grows up in complexity as people are using it , and the people who are using it , and the people who are usually going to use it .
They have a picture of marcate with the metaders in other people .
If you get the idea of contrast to each of these things are saying the name of this , my catchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchcheap of all those data , and I can use how to use it as a point of engineering for immerging in the space , and then we have a social experience of a kind of cross-modly , and have a kind of a kind of cross-moon .
Of course , a consequence of everything is what 's been virtual models of every part of the land , collected , of all interesting than the land , it 's going to be able to live and and similar images and similar images , but from the collective memory .
Milles thank you .
CA : I realized right ? What your software ? What your software is that you have to do is that , in the next few years , all of the next few years , all of the world will be practically related ?
BAA : Yeah . What 's doing is doing is actually discovered .
It 's creating hyperlink , if you want , in the images .
And it 's doing it in the base of the content of images .
The thing becomes very interesting if you think about wealth of semanties that many of these images possible images .
As when you do a research research on the web , you digit a phrase and the tbook on the web has a lot of information about the picture .
Now , what happens if that picture is you connected all your picture ?
So the amount of interconnection , the amount of semantics and the amount of rcheapy that is really huge . It 's a classical classroom .
CA : Blaise , it 's really amazing . It 's really amazing .
BAA : I 'm thank you very much .
One of the main pleasure when you travels and one of the phetnographic research is the pounds of the eat of the ants that traditions , in the wind , in the wind , the wind the plants , the wind the wind , the guess of the plants , the guess of the plants .
Basti thinking that the monans Jaguar vidrug , and that the world 's Via Lattea , or that the monites are still still in Himalaya , or that in Himalaya , the buddrespire of the Dharmor , but , to remember the importance of the world , and that the world 's idea that the world 's we live in a sense , but it 's just a model , but it 's just a model , but it 's just a model , but it is just a kind of reality .
the consequence of a particular set of adaptative choices that our styployed , well , many generations ago .
And of course , we 're all shark tracks .
We all procreating .
We are subjects in the beginning .
We have to deal with the inesorability of death , so we don 't surprising if we 're going to push and whom --
We all have an art .
What it does is the particular rhythm of the song , the rhythm of every culture .
It 's not care that they 're the Penan Irararainforests , or following the Vodoo of Haiti , or the desert of the Kenya , or the desert Kenya , or a settle in the Sail , or a cammar in the Sahara .
He was my journey of journey in the desert a month ago , or a yak of the alization of Qomolanger in the world .
All these populations teaches us that are other ways of thinking about other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , other ways of moving in the world .
And if you reflect a moment , it 's a concept that it can give you hope .
And together , the myries of the world creating a ragnote of spiritual life and cultural life that has the planet and it 's important for the benefit of the planet as the planet as the ragon as as biosphere .
And you can think about this recently , this ragnosphere and you can call the etnosphere and you can call the etnosphere is total of all the conception of all the conception of human consciousness , intuitions , intuitions , intuitions ,
The etnosphere is the fantastic patriage of humanity .
It 's the symbol of what we are and what we can be in how much species inquisitive .
And because the biosphere was gravingly consumed as it was as a successful success to the etnosphere and very quickly .
Nobody biologist , for example , that 's 50 percent of all the species was or is on the orggain , just because it 's fleep , or -- in the world of biological diversity -- in the world of biological diversity -- and not near near ar the most optimistic -- that 's the most optitimistic -- that 's the cultural diversity .
The whole thing is , of course , the language .
When you were born about 6,000 languages on this planet .
A language is not just composal by a vocabolary or a series of rules .
A language is the sprayon is the human spirit .
It 's the middle of which the animal of every culture comes in the material world .
Every language is a forest of mind , a strong , a thought , a thought , a remarkable ecosystem of the possibility of spiritual .
And of those 6,000 languages , as we are here in Monterey , at least half the most sitting in the orecchie of children .
They don 't get to teach children , the people who mean , not trust , that it 's not going to be bees something , who 's already death .
What is there more sad than being aved from the silence , of being the last talk about a language , about a language , of the language , of the sudden saggeety of the children ?
This is a factory of somebody in the world in some part of the world every two weeks : every two weeks a muor and door with the smaller , and a labs of an ancient language .
And I know , somebody of you will say , " isn 't it better ?
Wouldn 't it be a better place if we talk about all the same language ? " Benism , then we talk about all yoruba . We talk about the dotonese .
We talk about kogue .
You 're going to be a tract thing that means that we can 't talk about your language .
I 'd like to do you like to do a journey through the etnosphere --
a little journey in the etnosphere to give you a kind of what we 're losing .
Many of us forget that when I say , " different ways of exists , " I mean , really different ways of exists .
Let 's take for example , Barasana , in Amazonia , the popular of the anacond of the anaconda , which crede the myth of the latest in the slats of the slats in the slatest pants .
It 's a popular popular that it 's not able to distinct the blue color from the green green because the time you 're identified in the forest , which depends on the popular .
They have a strange language and a matrimonial rule , called " examia language " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " examia language . "
All of this has radical past mitologic past mythologic , is that in these expensive families in these expensive families in which are seven languages because of matrimons , one language .
They limited listen to the listen and then start talking .
We take one of the most interesting tribes that I lived , the Waorani of Ecuador an extra popular , an incredible popular that has been the early contacts in 19555555555558 .
In 1957 five missionaries have been trying a construct construct in a made mistake .
They did the top of the photographs that they race them in the world that they were going to come from the labor , forest that this popular of pluvial forest had never seen anything bi-dimenonal ,
They collected the picture from the earth , they went to the research or a shape or a , and not found anything , they 've been on the deavor , and they killed the five missionaries with the lance .
But the Waorans don 't kill the strange .
They killed them between them .
54 percent of the mortality was caused by their own .
We 've been eight generations and we found two cases of natural morath and when we 've been reached to know that one of them was invecent so that he died , and then killed it .
The crumers were able to recognize the animal urine from 40 steps and recognizes .
In the early ' 80s , I was assigned a really interesting task when my professor of Harvard , if I wanted to go to Harvard the secret of the power of Duvalier and Tonton Macooler and Tonton Macooler and Tonton Macooles , and impossesses of the velon Macooks .
To give a sense of miracologist , I had to understand the Vodoo culture . And that Vodoo not magnera .
It 's quite a pretty good view of a metaphical vision of the world .
Many interesting interesting .
If I asked you to say the big religions of the world , what do you ?
Cristianesimo , Islam , Buddhic , Ebraism , etc .
A continent is always left out , thinking about that the sub-Saharan Africa doesn 't have any any religious feels . And it 's the Vodoo is not other than the distilside of these things are very profound in the tragic tragic , and so so much profound in the slavor of the slavery .
What makes the interesting interesting voodoo is the intended between life and death .
So the vision they hidden the spirits .
The spirites can be invocated by the Grande Acqua , they say , they response to the end of the dance of the way that for a short time , and they 're going to be the way .
So , the voodooists love to say , " You white , you 're going to talk about God .
We say , we say in the temple and say , "
And from the moment that you 're rid of the spirit that you , how bad you , how bad you ?
So you have these incredible events : following voodoo in the state of trance that touches are impunted to a rather strong demonstration a rather strong demonstrate demonstrate in a state of extreme in a state of extreme .
And all the populations that I lived the most extraordinary of the most extraordinary Sierra Nevada Santa Marta , in the Santa Marta , in the settle .
It was the ancient of the ancient civilization that once they lived on the Colombia in the Colombia in the conquicist , the popular is sitting on the vuldoctor on the vuldoctor of the vulg-plant planning .
In a drude of blood continent , this popular was never conquisted by the spagreed by the dress .
But now now now now , the government from a clero , but their formation is really really really extraordinary .
The young people following are from the families to three or four years , and live sitting in a good world , and they live sitting in a good world , and ombar in the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice for 18 years .
Two periods of nine years old old old choices to reproduce the noine months of the agement that transformation in the ushor in the ushor in the ushor .
And so , for this time , they 're acculturate values of their society , values that pregnant and only their prayer and only their prayer , and only the cost of the balance of the balance of the balance .
And in the term of this incredible initiation , they 're suddenly landed out and for the first time in their 18 years , they see an alba . And in that moment , when the sun sun the sun is the sun of the landscape , everything that has learned in theory is a very much lendor . The pregnant is removed in the theory . The prete a step back and says , it does a step .
" Wote ? " I said , " I said .
It 's amazing . Now it 's study you . "
They call them greater brothers and say that we , the minors , we are the collipevolution of the world .
This level of intuition is extremely important .
When we think about Ingene populations and the environment of the Rousseau and the old story of the noble of the noble of the noble of the noble of his notion in the simplicity in its simplicity .
The Ingenes are not feeling feeling nine of the nostaly .
There 's no space for these things in the world of malarial things in the Asmaller , but thank you for the Tibet , but thank you for the time and the rules , but because of the time and the ran , but in a very closer intuition of the most subtle : the concept that the Earth can only live because it 's fell .
What does it mean ?
It 's saying that a girl of Ande who grow up the mountain is a spirit of Apu who 's going to drive his destine , which will be a human being destroy , and it 's going to have a very different kind of mountain , which is a very different mountain of the Montana who grow a mountain mass of rock , which is a massive mountain mass of rocks to be a sleep .
which is the dimora of a spirit or a mineral cutteral is irrelevant .
What 's interesting is the metaphor that defines the relationship between the individual and the natural world .
I grew up in the forests of the British Columbia credling that forests to be cut .
And this reso a human being different from my friends Kwakiutl who believe that the forests are the dimora of Hukukuk and the ball of the world 's paradise and the ball of the world , which is living in the world , the spirites that they 're going to live in the Hamatsa .
If you start to look at these cultures can create different reality , you can start to understand some of them feels . We make this planning .
I 've been taken this picture to open the Nortdocccclearly .
Maybe some of you have heard of the ayahuash , the most powerful place of psychoptively .
What makes it fascinating the ayahuash is not the potential potential of the substance of the substance , but his elaboration . It 's how two elements .
And on the side , this lian land-side side , this lian land-carboline , harmful and harmolines , laining .
I 'm taking the only plants of the plants , which is a little astro that altera little bit of consciousness , but it 's mixing the fleaves of a family of coffee .
This plants potent plays , very similar to the serotonine , very similar to the serotonine , methoxyptamine .
If you ever see Yanomami , you 'll be a different kind of , which is a different species , which do from a different species , anoman , it contains in the methoxypamine .
And I 'm going to go from the hidden is a little bit like being sparked by a pink of paper , and it 's going to land and land on a a kind of of electricity . [ Resated ] Don 't believe a destake .
I was often a lot of my professor , Richard Evan Shultes , the man who has taken the psychchased was psycheap , with his discovery of the loss in the 1930 in Mexico .
I think my tesis , you can 't classificate these tripptamine as it is hallucinated . And that you can 't tell anybody to be sleep .
It 's possible to be able to assume if they 're just sunds with other chemical chemical chemical chemical chemical substants .
Now , the beautiful Is that the cooo-carboline , which is injititute inhores of MAr , the same kind of necessarian inner , in a flour . The question of spontaneous question : in a flour of plants , like these popular species , like these popular ards , how do we create a track in this way , creating bioking biochemical .
We use the great eufactural eusususum of proof and error , that can reveal .
But if we ask the Indians , they 'll tell us " The plants are talking about . "
What does it mean ?
This tribes , the Cofan , has 17 variety of ayahuash , which are nice in the forest , and that we 're going to be in the same species .
If we ask how we ask them how they 'll say , " I was going to say , " I was thinking about the plants , of the rest of the rest of the rest of all ? "
The solution : you take the 17 variety of a lone , and each one will a different doterm .
So , this doesn 't have a laurea in Harvard , but it 's much more interesting that constructing the stage .
Now , [ [ applausi ] the problem is that even the ones of us who have to heart popular people find peeeer , but in some way we reduced in the world , and then .
In fact , the XXXXXXXage century , it 's not remembered for his driving or innovations , but rather as the cell was in which we stopped and we 've been active and improved actively accepted or accepted into the world . Now the problem is not the change .
All the cultures through the centuries were involved in a new possibility of life .
And the problem is not the technology .
The Indians Sioux have no stopped to be Sioux when they put in the arch and fly as Americans don 't have stopped to be Americans when they put in the horse and calute .
It 's not the change or technology that minate the integrity of the etnosphere . It 's the power . It 's the power . It 's the power .
The last fly of the domination .
And if you give a look at the world , you 'll find that these are not destinated cultures destinated .
They are living and living dynamics and dynamics outside of hyth-identify , that will go beyond their adaptation .
I know that the disboboscring in the pathria of the pathria --
a popular notion of Sarawak , in the soul of Sarawak , a popular popular that has libero in the forest to a generation ago , and now reduced to the service and prostitution on the reserves , where you can see the river in the sought that it looks like the fiume inquinese , where the ran is the horizon Merion Merion , where the r.
Women to reempize the wood wood is to the forest .
Or in case of Yanomami , are the disease that I got the payers that came with the discovery of the gold .
If we move on the mountains of the Tibet , where I 'm doing a lot of research , you 'll see the hard of the political domination .
As a genocide , the physical summit of a popular popular , is constructed universal level , but the inner of life , the destruction of a popular , but advvice , it 's not just not just , but advice crucide in certain environments , because it does part of development .
And you can 't understand the suffering of Tibet until it comes from the beginning .
I 've been there in the Western China China in China China in China through the Tibet , I got to the Mbet , I got to the statistics , but only came to Lhasa young college , but only came up in Lhasa , I 've been talking about .
6,000 sacres reduced in pollust and cenjoy .
1.2 million people killed by the military Rivolution .
The father of this guy was ascriticized in the Panchen Lama .
which means that it was killed by the temple of the Chinese invasion .
His , I was sitting with Santity in Santity in the diaspora that has taken the popular in Nepal .
Sua mother was imprigioned and his colpe was rich .
It was brought to career in the age of two birth of the age of two birth under his gonna because he wouldn 't have to live without him .
The sister , who did the same , it was mitted in reeducational reeducation .
A day , he was calculating a day of Mao and , for this transgression , was mitted to this , was mitted to the several years .
The pain of Tibet can be inbet , but the recenter of the popular is from the tener .
And finally , everything is reduced to a choice .
We want to live in the world world world of the monocromath or we want to accooking the world of diversity ?
The great anthropologist Margaret Mead , before he died her biggest paper was that , in our own way to this view of love , we 're going to see the whole whole gamoring of human reduction , but a day we 'll see a day we 're going to go from a modality , but a day we 'll be able to .
And it 's umillion people remember that our species is about 600,000 years old .
The Neolitics Rivolution , who gave us agriculture , who has done us succombine to the culture of the seed of the smop of the smop of the clero , creating the gerarchia of specialization , and we talk about 10,000 years ago .
The modern world industrialized world has 300 years .
That squallies that we don 't suggests that we have the answers that we have the answers that we 're going to deal in the millennia to come .
When these myriads of cultures of the world is asked what means to say to be human , they say , they say , they 're going to do with 10,000 voices .
And it 's in these answers that we all have the possibility of being what we are : a consciousness of that all the populations and all the given the people and all the gardens can be fioring .
I 've been taken this picture on the northern extremity of Baffin , when I went to caccount with the Inuit , and this man , Olaya , and this man , Olaya , and he was told me a wonderful story of his grandfather .
The downnnice was not always gentile with the Inuit , and in the ' 50s to stabilire our supremise , we 've required them in colonies .
The grandfather of this man refed to go .
Scil , teming for her life , and all of his arms , and all his actions .
You know that Inuit doesn 't temon the cold , they don 't temh .
The pattins of sleep in origin were made of pain in the skin blue .
The grandfather of this man did not intimiddry or from the library or from the library , who was in the libraries .
It 's sgattaiolated , it 's calculated the pantalone in the skin and defecated in your hand . When the fit came up , they 've got the lama .
He sprrate on the downnice of this coltelem , and when it became solid , he got killed a dog .
He took the dog and created a brilaughter , with the cast of toathactic , has embrbringing another dog and it is disappeared on the banks , and it 's disappeared on the remain .
We want to talk about cavarsely with nothing ?
In the april 1999 , the downnnine has redded by the Inuit 's fully the most largest control of a larger land of California and Texas a set of together .
It 's the new patria . It 's called Nunut .
It 's a independent territory . They all the resources .
One of the example of how a natione-state , can rerecognize with his popular .
And , finally , I think it 's quite obvious at least in those remote song in these remote song of the planet , realized that they don 't really have remote .
For somebody 's house .
They representing the several of human imagination that rises in the time . And for all of these children , like the dreams of these children , like the dreams of these children , becomes part of geography of hope .
By the way , we have Geographic , we have convinced that politicians will never get anything .
We believe that the polemies --
[ Applausi is not persuasive , but we believe that stories can change the world , and maybe we think the best institution to tell the stories of the world . Every month of our website . ]
156 countries spent our television dog .
We have the resources are letters from millions of people .
Our work is to traveling in the etnosphere to bring our audience in places places , from which will go through how they 've seen and , and we have hopefully , abled , and they will be able to be able to , and we have to find a living in diversity , and we have to find a life in a pluralist and we have to find a life in a pluralist and to find a life in a pluralist and to find a life of life in a pluralist and we have to find a life in a life in a life , and we have to find a life in a life in a a a a a a
where the saggeety of all the popular can contribution to our benefits .
Thank you .
I 'm going to talk about some of the things I wrote in this book that I hope you 've heard and try to prove some of the college of the college of them .
I 'd like to start with what I call " the official dogma official . "
Does the official of what ?
The dogma official , of all the Western industry , the official dogma , " If we want to massive well-being of our citizens . "
The reason is , from one side , in fact that freedom is a value , is pretious , is pretious , essential , is the pretiful for human beings .
The other is in fact that if we 're liball , each of us can act for just doing everything that massive , not one that we can act for our well-being , not one that we 're going to say ,
The way to massive freedom is massive choice .
More choice people have , more libed , and more , is their freedom , the most of them is their benbe .
This , I think , it 's so deeply radicated in society that nobody would be able to put it in the doubt .
And it 's also deeply roomed in our lives .
I 'm going to show you some examples of what progress has made possible .
This is my supermarket . It 's not particularly big .
I 'm going to have a simple note about the condition of inhall .
In my supermarket , there are 175 condition , without constructing the 10 variety of olive olive and 12 acetes , which you can buy for a huge number of condition of condition in the increspective circumstance that one of 175 proning , there is a big degree of the masters .
Here 's how the supermarket .
And then you go to the electronic stereo to buy a stereo : casse , in the CD , radio , radio , the race , the race .
And in this single core , there is a big number of audio components , there 's a big number of audio components .
We can make six million and a half million different combinations , using the components that there are in one store .
You have to admit that there is a lot of choice .
Altri camps : the world of communications .
One time , when I was a child , they could get all the telephone services , to pat that the telephone service .
It was going to go the phone , you didn 't buy it .
A consequence of that , in the other , was that the telephone never break .
These days are gone .
We have a variety of telephone , especially between the phones , especially between cell phones .
Here 's the cell phones of the future .
My favorite is the one in the MP3 , tapeli , and the ball of the nose , and the forcccut .
If you don 't have seen it in the store under house , you 're ben certs that will be going to get .
And what happens is that people entra in the negoties and this question . And you know what is the answer is " No . "
It 's not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn 't do that .
So , in other things that are much more important than acquired than acquired , you know , you know , the same explosion of choice .
Agranddrum : no longer in the United States that you go from the doctor and the doctor you have to do .
Instead , you go from the doctor , and the doctor says , " OK , we could do A , or B , " A has these benefits and these risks , " Bs these wells and these risks . What do you want ? "
And the people say , " Dotic , what should I do ? "
And the doctor says , " A has these benefits and these risks , and B has these benefits and these risks . "
" What do you want to do ? "
And you rebits : " Dotic if she was me , what would you do ? "
And the doctor : " But I 'm not her . "
The result of the result of the maled " " , " expression that does look like a beautiful thing .
But actually it 's not that one to move the weight and responsibility of making decisions from somebody who knows something , is the doctor , to somebody else that doesn 't know -- and so much of course , and so not in the ideal condition to make decisions .
There 's a huge marketing of products , you know , you know , like me and you , that if you think you don 't have any sense , because you think we can 't buy them .
But if we don 't buy them , because they have public public icizate ?
The answer is that they want to domorning we call the doctor to ask the rich to ask us to change it .
So , what we have the most fundamental identity is a question of choice , as you see in this vision , " We don 't want to prove children . They choose their smomoss at at at the right right right . " We need to invent .
And we can reinvent how many times we do it .
which means that every morning , you have to decide that kind of person wants to be .
I 'm going to the family and marriage , a time , a common time , it almost for everyone , was that it was that there was the most soon possible , and it was that it was going to be able to do the most price .
The only versible was with who , not when , and even even what do after .
Ost day , it 's really toy .
I 'm smart students very smart students , and I 'm going to be at less than a time .
And it 's not because they 're less good , not because they 're less diligent .
but why am I impensive , I mean , I 'm going to tell you , " Do you know ? "
" Do I have to tell me later ? I think before you , or I was going to think before or the career ? "
They 're interrogative logorants .
And they try to answer these questions , even though this implesson , even though this is not able to get a bel of my own own .
And they have to do it . I 'm important questions .
Now , the work : we are lucky , like Carl soon , because technology allows us to work every minute , every day , every day , from every day , every day , from every corner of the planet , but from every day , from every day , from every day , from every day , from every day , from every day , from every corner of the planet , and that from every
And I 'm talking about , there is a angle , and I didn 't say anybody who , where the WiFi works .
I don 't say , because I want to use it .
What does this mean , this amazing freedom of choice that we have to continue , continuously decide , continuously , we have to work or not .
We can go to see our son playing calcies , with the cell phone in a race , Blackberry in the other , and the news tebook , typically , on the gock .
And even though I 'm all spent , every minute that we see our son drug , we 're also asking the particizing , " Do you say , " " " " " " " ? "
" Do I answer this email ? I have to get this letter ? "
And also when the answer is " no , all this makes the experience of your own son very different physicians from what would be in other conditions .
So , anywhere we look , small things and big materials , and big materials and life , life is a question of choice .
One time the world was this : Ovreal , there were some possibility , but it wasn 't a question of choice .
The world of today looks like this : the dilemmma is , " Is it a positive thing , or negative ? "
The answer is Scil .
We know the positive layers we all talk about the negative ones .
All this choice is two two negative effects on people .
The first , paradoxtisally , is that produced paralysis , instead of liberation .
With many topons between which choice , becomes very hard to do it .
I 'm going to give you an example : a conduct on the voluntedness of fly .
A colleague has had access to the data of the Vanwatd , the gigantic society of a source of a clients of clients in 2,000 different companies .
What she found is that for every 10 solutions that are offered in the most , percentage of adesion , the one scenes of two percent .
With 50 source source , there is 10 percent in less adesions than when they have only five . Why ?
Because with 50 sources the source of which choice is maledgely hard to decide , and choice is remadied in the tomorrow .
And I was the tomorrow , and again , tomorrow , tomorrow , and of course , we have never come .
Wite that doesn 't mean that only these work from old old old , because they don 't have enough money , because they don 't want to say that the decision is so ostics that lose the decision is so otherwise that lose the fundamental fundamental fundator .
Not participating , they 're loss up to five dollars for year from work , which would be blind to be true .
So the paralsis is a consequence of having too many choice .
And I think it makes the world .
" And finally , for the eternity : ketchup , send or major maionese ? "
You would just take the right decision , if it 's for the right ethernity , right ?
You don 't want to choice the wrong wrong , and nepther the wrong condition .
So this is the first effect . The second is that we can avoid the paralis and do a choice , at the end we 're less ssatic , we 're less sleep options from the results that choice .
And this for different reasons .
One of these is that with many condition of those are that you choice , if you buy one and it 's not perfect , it 's easy to imagine that you could do a different choice that would be better . And what happens is that the alternative . And what happens is that the alternative , and the replacement is the respair the soddisfing the soddisfer , and the repair the soddisfed of the decision of the ressed .
And when it was a good decision .
And so , there are , more easy displeasased than any detail that it is unsatisfacent of choice .
And also , there is what economists call .
Dan Gilbert has close very well as the value of the value that we do things that that we do the depends on the things that we confronted .
And , when there are many options , there are so many options , it 's easy to represent the attractive characternative , and being less satic , and being less satic .
Here 's an example . I 've all been in New York .
But that 's what you probably think you 're probably thinking .
There 's this couple of Hamptons .
A place of lussian place .
It 's smotherwise . It 's all about them . It 's all for them .
It 's nothing . But what he thinks is , " Well , maldaily , it 's Agotured . "
" All my neighbor Manhattan is on . "
" I could talk about it right right in front of home . "
And I 'm going to go two weeks I have been loss -- every day -- the possibility of parking where it wants .
The expensive opportunity diminures of what we have , when the choice was a cell cell .
And the options we have to look at , the most the acteristics that we 'll get to think about how expensive expensive opportunity .
Here 's another example .
This is a lot of things .
It 's about living the moment , and maybe in living in the world , maybe of living in the world .
But the most important point is that anything you choice , you go to do not doing other .
The things that we don 't choose are so many attractive attractive that can make less attractive what we do .
And third point : the spiral growth of expectations .
I tried it on my skin buying a new couple of jeans .
I 'm almost always jeans .
One time the jeans were just a kind of , buy them and slees and besty besty , they just had a life and work , just after having them a life and work , they were starting to go well .
So , I went to buy a couple of time when the old old old were gone , and I said , " I need a couple of jeans , this is my cut . "
The commit of me said , " Li wants slim fit , exploring fit ? "
Do you want to the cernera or " Women , " Stonebottons ? "
" Look does it take ? "
" Do you want to get them ? Ble bla bla -- " Continured it . "
I was sent sbalorger , and after a little bit I could say , " I want the guy that was the only guy who was the only guy , so for a moment , I tried to say , " I 'm all going to be . "
It was the massive . I had the best .
But I felt worse .
Why ? I wrote a whole book for understood .
The reason I was worse is that with all that choice was very high , the jeans had to be perfect .
I was expectations . I didn 't expect to wait for anything about that , when there was 100 different than 100 different step , steps , at least one guy had to be perfect .
What I had buy was good , but not perfect .
And I was a deparagoned what I was skied in confronted expectations .
The options in the life of people don 't do that increasing the expectations that these have respect to the options that these are respect to the options of the options in the life .
And this will produring less lifation , even when the results are good .
Nobody in the marketing world , if you realize .
Because if they knew , you wouldn 't know what I 'm talking about .
The truth is the most of this .
" It was better when it was worse , " the reason that was worse when it was worse was worse when it was worse was worse to meet of surprised .
Ost , in the world that we live -- opulents , citizes citizens with expectancy , the massive that we can hope is that things to the altness of expectations .
You never have surprised pleasant because your expectations , my expectations , you 're ingigantic .
The secret of happiness -- what you 're here -- is , " Basis , " " Yes , " you want . "
I mean , the little biographic moment -- that I 'm really smarried and my wife is really amazing .
I couldn 't do it , I couldn 't do , I 'm not accounted .
But it 's not always a bad thing .
And finally , a consequence of buy a couple of jeans that 's just that kind of jeans is that when you 're not satic , and ask you " Why ? "
" Who is responsible ? " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " Who 's close .
The world is the responsible . What can we do you ?
When there are hundreds of kinds of jeans , and you buy one insoddisfacing , and ask you who is responsible , it 's the clear that the responsible is you .
You could do better .
With hundreds of variety of variety available , there are not scapes for the insuccessful .
So when people take decisions , even though the results is satic , they feel insodddisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdis
In the last few years , the depression is explose in the world .
I think a significant factor -- not the only one , but important -- of this depression is that people have experiencency experiency experiencency because the standards are too high .
And when they have to explain this situation think that the colpe is they .
So the final results is that in general results , but we feel worse .
Let 's remember you .
This is the official dogma , what we 're all take for good and it 's completely fleight . It 's not true .
There 's no doubt that a little bit of choice is better that not have any business , but it doesn 't really really really really have to do that a little bit better than a little bit .
There 's a critical value . I don 't know what it is .
But I 'm sure we 've been supply than a piece of the level in which choice to do our life .
Now , from the political point of view -- I 'm almost finished -- from political view , the noccccalculate , the noccccalculate .
What it allows this is the material rich , is the material rich .
There are many places in the world , and you know , you 're talking about that the problem is not that have been choice .
The problem is that they have too few .
So the cenda that I 'm talking about is a malbeing excuse of modern modern society , rich society .
And what it does depress and array is this : Steve Levitt you talked about how those expensive and discovered in the bomb for bilikely .
I mean these choice , complicated and available , it 's not that just inuseful .
I 'm addicted deletime .
And they 're worse .
If a little bit of what our society in our society , it 's a reversated in those where people have too few possibility , it would not just have their life to improve , but our life .
This is what economists call a parety-up improving .
A redistribution of the income redistribution of all -- not only to the poverty -- because of this choice in except that we get us .
By the end , you can become everything you want " --
You , people , culture , you think , " What does that fish ? "
" It 's obvious that you can 't get anything in a glass . "
" A imagination , a limited view of the world -- "
and anchy I interpreted it so , at the beginning .
But then , I think , instead , I realized that what the fish knows the long knows the long knows .
Because the reality of fact is that if you mand in frantum , so that it 's possible " not good freedom . " It 's the paralysis .
If you break the bock in a way that everything divents as possible diminures .
And you 're going to get the paralsis , and you reduced the well-being .
Everybody needs a sphere .
This is almost certainly too much , maybe even even in the fish , and certainly for us .
But the abunddyges , sphere is a recipe for infelity and , theme , for the ruine .
Thank you very much of the heart .
