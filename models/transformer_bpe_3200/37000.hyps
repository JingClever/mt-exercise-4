Last year , I showed these slides to show that the Arctic glacial calottical , which for almost three million years , had the size of 48 continental dimensions , has been remarkable to the U.S. continental , has been remarkable to 40 percent .
But this is a gravity of the problem because it doesn 't show the spreading because it doesn 't show the spreading of the ice .
The arctic glacial calottical is , in a way , the clear heart of the global climate system .
You expanded up and handwider and retired of extreme .
The next positive is going to be a kiter-to-ran on the last 25 years .
Still pay of the ice are red in red .
You see , they expand until the blue wall .
That 's the ice in winter , which is ritiated .
You can see that cosidges you can see that so-year-old ice , is like blood , which is like blood from the body .
In 25 years , it 's past , at that .
This is a problem because the heating interest the terrain the ocean where there are enormous amounts of carbon where there are enormous amounts of carbon congled that , the melted , they 're transformed into metry microbes .
Right to the totality of global pollution from global warming , that amount of of global warming , that could doubled , super-scale .
In some little deep laghi , in Alaska metane , is already rebolling from water .
The Katey professorse of the University of Alaska was Alaska was a very low bottom of the last winter .
Video : Wow ! Al Gore : You 're good . The question is if we 're going to be .
And that 's why this termal exambier surround from the North .
This is a glacial regime .
The layers never reached the similar .
This is the Kangerlussuaq , in the southwest of Groenland .
If you want to know how the sea level for the sea level of the ice on terraferm , here is where the sea .
These currents are increasing rapidly .
Anowhere the planet : Antarctica , the largest block of the planet .
The last month scientists have dichieve that the bills of the ice is in negative , and that the Western Antarctica , which is particularly quickly , in the melt of the submarine , is particularly quickly in the month .
It 's six feet of the boundaries , like in Groenland .
Sulil Himalayas , the third largest block of ice , you see new laghi , which a few years ago , were glaciers .
40 percent of the world 's population half of the world 's population half of the water from that meless .
Sulle Ande : this glacier is the source of the water source of this city .
The landed is increased .
But when you decrease , the same thing happens to the water .
In California , the newnow on Sierra Nevada is 40 percent decreased .
The idricical bacin crisis .
The predictions , as you read , they 're good .
The increasing drum in the world leads to a remarkable increases .
The environmental disasters are increasing a rhythm outside of the normal and without precedented .
Four times more numhers in the last 30 years , than the previous 75 .
This is a whole thing that is unsustainable .
If you look at the context of historic , if they can see the consequences .
In the last five years we added 70 million tons of CO2 every 24 hours -- 25 million tons of tons in the ocean every day .
Look at the East Pacific area , the Americas , to the west , and on both parts of the Indian subcontinent , where there 's a radical radical impoverty of oxygen in the ocean .
The major causes global warming , together with deforestation , which is 20 percent of them , is the use of fossil fuels .
Oil is a problem , and carbon is even worse .
The United States is one of the most emissions , together to China .
And he was proposed to build a lot of other central carbon .
But we 're seeing a direction of the way .
These are the advance anullated projects in the last few years and some green alternative projects .
Any way , there 's a political fight in our country .
The carbon industries and oil have spent 250 million dollars in the last year to promoting carbon industries , which is a oxide .
I 'd remember that I 'd remember something --
Viron Natal Tennessee , where I live , there was 3.8 billion liliters of carbon screams .
Maybe you saw on news .
This is the second largest flow in America .
It 's happened around Natale .
The birth of one of the carbon industry was this .
Video : I 'm sure , I 'm a little bit of a bandwider and happy .
It 's abundant here in America , and it will grow our economy .
Frosty carbon is increasingly .
It 's good price , adorable and the workers are keeping the stage .
Al Gore : So , here 's a lot of the West Virginia .
The largest mineral society on the mountains is Massey Coal . This is his administrator .
Video : Don Blankenship : I 'll be clear -- Al Gore , Nancy Pelous , Harry Reid -- they don 't know what they 're talking about .
Al Gore : So the Alleance for the Clima has launched two campaigns .
This is a one of them , one part .
Video : Acore : Acore : Alil COALergy we see climate change , like a sery of the business .
So our priority is to invest a lot of money in a effort to make public and confused in public and confused the truth of carbon .
In fact , carbon is not lovely .
We think it 's clean -- it 's also a good smoke .
So , not pitch of climate change .
Let me do it .
Video : Cr. Carbone -- you 've heard a lot of them .
So we do a turn into a structure at the lawyers at the hanger of the puly-list .
Straordinary ! The machines are a little noise , but this is the sound of the puly-carbon technology .
The carbon consumption is among the main causes of global warming , but the remarkable technology that you see all changes .
You look at a look , this is the hot technology of cleaners .
Al Gore : Indeed , the positive alternative positive conducts to the economic issue and the national security .
Video : Comment : America is in crisis ; the economy , national security ,
The file that connects all : our dependence by fossil fuels , like the sports of fossil fuel , like the spored oil .
Now , there 's a new audace , audace solution for users .
Repowering America : 100 percent of clean energy , in 10 years .
A plan to put America to work , make us more certainly , and help us stop the global warming .
Finally , a solution that was in solving our problems .
Repowerful .
Al Gore : This is the last .
Video : Comment : It 's about re-energy .
One of the fastest ways of enables to independence from combustible that killing our planet .
Comparse : The future is here . Very , a new energy network .
Comparse number two : New investment for well retribes .
Repower America . It 's time to be realists .
Al Gore : A African proverbio , he says , " If you want to go fast , go to yourself .
If you want to go away , you go together . "
We have to go away , fast .
Thank you very much .
LHunch for a LHC .
And promise to return to the way to get around the machine .
So there I 'm a little bit . And for the other time , the LHC is the largest scientific experiment ever ever tried -- 27 kilometers of circumstoms .
His task is to reconstructions that were at least less than a billion billion times .
That 's just ambicious .
This is the machine belt in the Ginevra .
We do this little little Big Bang in the relevevators .
This is what I work on . It 's called ATLAS -- is 44 meters and has a damer 22 meters .
This is a spectacular picture of ATLAS in built , so you can see proportion .
Teeptember of the last year , we accesum the machine for the first time .
And this picture was taken by ATLAS .
It was because of immense festeggiving in control room .
It 's a picture of the first fashion that had made all the turn of LHC , entering in collision , by one of the LHC , and spread particles into the detector .
In other words , when we see that picture 10 settember , we realize that machine worked , which is a great witty .
I don 't know if it was this to extra more or this , when somebody went on on Google and see that the initial page was this .
That means we have a cultural impact beyond .
About a week later , there was a problem with the machine , had to these sleep here -- these dories .
These flaps are 13,000 pound when the machine works at the massive power of the power of the power of the power .
Now , technique between you will look at the sleep and say , " It 's not true . I 'm very throof too thrown . "
And they can do that because when they 're very freezing superconvicted of superconvicted files .
So , at least 271 degrees , at least 271 degrees on the space between stars , these can bring that current .
In one of the juncles between the magneti magneti magneti , there was a defect of fit .
So the file surrounding , and the 13,000 levels suddenly meant that they had an electrical resistance .
This was the result .
Now , this is more impressive if you think that these magnetes more than 20 tons , and that have moved about 30 centimeters .
You 've been damaged about 50 magnets .
We had to take them , what we did .
We restinated them and lay .
Now they 're now going to go back all the subland .
By the end of the march the LHC is going to be again integral .
We will access it , and we expect to get data or June , and we look so our adventure our adventure to discover what I 'm the morning that we 're constantly on the universe .
Now , of course , in a way that these accidents reach the debate on the value of science and engineering in front . It 's easy to contain future .
I think the fact that it 's so difficult , the fact that I think it 's the value of things like LHHC .
I want to end with the words of a English scientist , Humphrey Davy , which , I guess , in defense of the inuseful experiments of his pupile , his pupile was Michael Faraday , said , " Nient is so dangerous for progress of the human mind how the thought the ideas of science is defined , that there are not unfortune in nature , that our triumphy , and there are not a lot of new monstrates . "
Thank you .
I want to start asking you to rethink when , you 're playing with children , played on the morning .
As you get to get them and make them , and get them , take them and move them , you learn in fact , you learn to think and solve problems and spatial problems .
The space reasoning is is deeply connected to the way we understand most of the world around us .
So , from information inspired by the usulessness of our interaction with physical things , together to my Ps , and my collaborator Jeevan Kalanithi , I started asking , " And if we use a computer , instead of having the only of the multi-pastraily as digital ly-digital interaction that moves on a desktop , we have a trust , we wish information both hands on a front of the hands ,
and put it in our pleasure ?
The question was so interesting that we decided to explore the answer , building Siftable .
In a words , a Siftable is a great interactive computer as a biscoscoothing .
In a words , a Siftable is a great interactive computer as a biscoscoothing .
You can move them with them , they can see them , you can see their motion and feel their motion and have a screen and a wireless .
But more importantly , they 're physical objects , like the mors , you can just move grandchildren .
Siftable is the example of a new ecosystem of tools to manipulate digital information .
And as they become more physicists , conscious , consciousness of the other , and as they become more physicists , consciousness of the motion , of others , of how they die , we can explore new ways of interaction .
I 'm going to start with some simple example .
This Siftable is configured to show video of video : if you 're going to stop it in a direction , video will rotate this , if you go back to the other side .
These interactive portraits are conscious recognize other .
If I ran them , they 're interested in what they 're around .
If they 're surrounded , and they can act a little bit .
If they 're surrounded , and they can act a little bit .
They also have their movement and inclination .
And then I realized that one of the interesting implications of the interaction was to be able to use common data , for example , to speak " a color like it . "
In this case , we have three Siftable of configurate as slessed bucks and I can use them to fix the color in that central , where they mix .
and I can use them to pay for the color in that central , where they 're missed .
If we 're too too , we can put a little bit in the place .
There are also beautiful possibility of learning , like language , like language , mathematics and loges where people can try things very quickly , and see the results immediately .
Now I 'm --
This is a Fibonaccount that I do with a program of equations .
Here we have a words game between Scarabees in the Scarabees and Boble .
Pratically , at all you get a letter case on every Siftable , Pratically , at every Siftable , Pratically , at every Siftable , and when you 're trying to buy him in words .
Then , after about 30 seconds remix remimix , and you have a new lectural set of reading and new possibilities to try .
Thank you .
Here 's the children came to the Media Lab , I did so that they tribe and I turned out to a video .
They are very pleased .
And one of the interesting things like this kind of apply is that you have to give people a lot of instructions .
You just say , " Compons of words , and they know exactly what to do .
Here are other people who try it .
This is our younger younger tester than there , there on the right .
It actually wanted to be impilling them .
They were only morning moroncines , for him .
Now , this is a appliation of an interactive cartoon .
We wanted to build a tool for the apprentice of Lui language is Felix .
It can put new characters in the scene , lift Siftable them .
It can put new characters in the scene , lift Siftable them .
So , it 's doing the sun .
Video : Sun is smiling .
David Merrill : Now it 's took a treatment in the scene .
Video : The arange is .
Bel work ! Yeah !
So , you know , Siftable and put them neighbors can get the characters --
Video : Bau !
-- inventing their own story .
Video : Hi !
DM : It 's a story with open , and it can decide him like .
DM : It 's a story with open , and it can decide him like .
Very : Film .
DM : The last example I have time to show you is a tool , which is a recently made , to sample and execguish music .
It 's a tool , recently made , to trampioneshy and exececutionary music .
Siftable here , the Siftable here , based on the bacteria .
Each one of these has four different variations , and you can choose which use .
You can also put these sounds in a sequence to get your pleasure .
And you just change it by doing a straight sound and a sequence .
These are actually actually able effects that you can control from the alive , like the reverber and .
The attacks to a particular sound and then fixes for them .
And then there are general effects like and volume , which are applied in sequence .
We look at how it works .
Video : We 'll start putting a number of Siftable , we 'll start a set , we put them in a series , we put it in a series , we add more .
Now , I put a laptop of it .
Video : I add the percussions --
Video : And I 'll put the filter at the bacteria , so I can control the effect from the alive .
Video : DM : I can fast the entire sequence of time from one side .
Video : DM : And now I 'm going to add the bottom to give more expression .
Video : DM : I can recombine the sequence to flight .
So I didn 't have to plan it before , but I can improvisate , make it longer or corrupt .
And now , finally , I can spray the entire sequence by the Siftable .
Thank you .
So , you can see , my passion is to build new mo-to-silver machine and more better than how our brain work and body .
And today , I 've had time to show you one of the results of this path , and also some possibility that we try to bring out of the lab .
The concept I want to convention you is that 's coming this new generation of designed designed to interact with digital media media designed to interact with digital media , which we want .
Thank you very much .
I don 't see the time to talk with all of you .
I 'm a writer .
And I 'm writing books is my profession , but it 's more than that , of course .
It 's also love and the fascination of my life .
And I don 't look like that that can change .
But , said , something particularly happened in my life and the career , who brought me to recently the entire relatively related with this work .
The particular thing is that I recently wrote this book , this biography called " Mangia , Prega , Ama , " which , diversly from my books , for some reason why he came out in the world and became a great , bestseller , international besseller .
And the result is that everywhere , people treat me as if I were convicted .
Really -- you say , you convicted .
They 're all from me , and they say , " Don 't you fear to be able to do better ?
You don 't care of continuing to write for all life without being able to create a book that can be able to create a book that can be able to create a book that can be able to create a book that can be able to create a book that can be able to create a book that can be able to create a book that can be able to create a book that 's worth somebody ? "
that can be importantly to someone ? "
It 's reinsurance , you know .
But it could go worse , except that I remember that I 'm more than 20 years ago , when I started saying to people -- I was a text -- I wanted to be a writer .
I 'd go to the same reaction that I was a fear .
And people said , " Don 't you could have successful ? "
Do you don 't care that the humiliation killed you ?
Do you don 't care of doing this wearing for all life without anything that comes out and die on a cumulation of the dreams with the mouth of the full of failure to stay of failure ? "
So you know .
The answer -- the short answer to all of these questions is , " Yes . "
Yeah , I 'm afraid of all those things .
I 've always had fear .
And I also fear of many other things that people can 't guess .
Like the algae and other things .
But , as it was about the writing what I thought and I 'd say , " " " " " " "
Is it rational ?
It 's logical that anyone who has to wait to be scared by a job that you feel born to do .
But what 's so specific impress in the creative companies that makes us nervous health of the mental health of each other , in a way that other careers don 't do ?
How my father , for example , he was a chemist engineer and I don 't remember one time in his 40 years of activity in their activity that they were asked if he was willing to be engineer ?
There was never -- that blown of the John John engineer 's what does ?
It didn 't work like that , you know ?
Onestly , chemists like chemical engineers like they don 't have a group of depressives .
We have a writers , we have enough this reputation , and not only writers , but creatives of all kinds of things , we have this reputation of being enormous .
And it 's not about looking at the sad of context of the deaths of creative magnificments that , only in the 21st century , they die young and often for them .
And even the ones that don 't have sound like to be really dissed by their dungs .
Norman Mailer , before he died , in the last interview said , " Every , my book killed me a little more " an extraordinary affermation about the work of its life .
But we don 't get the tough , when we feel that we heard these things so long that in some way , we have completely interiorized and accepted the notion that creativity and suffering are in some ways of the same way way .
And the question I want to take to all of this today is : are you all with this idea ?
You can do this thing -- because it also looked at a centimeter of distance to me not good for this supposition .
I think it 's hate .
And I think it 's dangerous and I don 't want to see the perpetuate perpetuate in the next century .
I think it 's better encouraging our creative minds live .
And I certainly know that , in my case -- in my case -- in my situation -- it would be very dangerous to start smoke towards that track of supposition the circumstances I 'm in my career .
That 's -- you look at the same , it 's pretty young , I have about 40 years .
I still have about four work decades of work in me .
And it 's very likely that anything I writing in now , it 's going to be judged after the world like the work that came out of my last book .
I 'm going to be slaves , because we 're all more or less friends here -- it 's likely that my big success is my shoulder .
Oh , Gesus , who thought !
You know this is the kind of thought that leads a person to start behing gin in the morning , and I don 't want to do it .
I would keep on doing this work that we love .
So , the question becomes , how ?
And so it seems to me , after many reflecting , which the way of working to keep writing is to create a psychological struction , OK ?
I have to find a safety distance of security between me , which I 'm writing , and my natural anxiety about what reaction is going to do that . And I was looking for all the time , trying to find other societies to see if they could have more and more societies than doing it , trying to find other societies to see if they could have more and more healthy ideas .
about how to help the creative people manage emotivity .
And that research took me to the Grek and an old Rome .
I 'm going to go through the circle and then comes back .
In the ancient Greek and an old Rome -- people didn 't look like to believe that creativity came from men , OK ?
It was thought that the creativity was this watching deal and that they come to the men from some distant and unknown , for distant and unknown , for distant reasons , for distant reasons .
The Greeeks called these spiriters of the creativity of creativity .
Socrate , wonder , he believed that he was a saggness that was wisdom from remote .
The Roomes were the same idea , but they called the kind of spirit .
which is great , because the Roands didn 't really think that a genius was somebody who was particularly intelligent .
They believed that a genius was this kind of divine entity , who was literally in the walls of an artist , a little like the elpho Dobby , and that came out of the work of the artist and modeling the rest of that work .
Eductional -- here 's the distance of which I talk about -- that psychological struction that you protects you from your work .
And everybody knew that was how it worked , right ?
So the anti-artists were protected by certain things , like , for example , too much , like , too , not ?
If your work was exceptional , you couldn 't take all the place , everybody knew that you were helped by this incorporate genius .
If your work failure , it wasn 't your whole , right ?
Everybody knew it was your genius to be an unable .
And so people han conceive creativity in Occe for a long time .
And then the Renaiaissance came and changed this big idea ; we put the human being over the universe over all the way and the mysteries and without leave space of the universe .
This was the rational principle of rational and people started thinking that creativity was completely from the isse .
And for the first time in history , you start to refit to this or artist as a genius that you 're in a very genius .
And I have to say , I think it was a big mistake .
I think I allow someone , a simple person to believe that they 're like a recipient like the source , the essence and the source of all the mysteries , creatives , unknown as a sign in a very big wildness from human fragile .
It 's like to ask someone to enjoy the sun .
Deform and distores all the ego and creates all these inespecially expectations .
And I think it was this pressure that I 've destroyed the artists in the passed 500 years .
And , if this is true , and I think it 's , the question becomes , and now ?
Can we do that ?
Maybe you can go back to a more ancient understanding of the relationship between human and creative mystery .
Or maybe not .
Maybe we can 't cell 500 years of rational thinking in a 18 minutes in a talk of 18 minutes .
And there 's probably people in the audience that would have a legitimate scientific news about the notion of , you know , they follow the people by by by doing things .
I 'm probably not convince you all about this .
But the question I 'd like to ask is -- why not ?
Why don 't it think about this way ?
Because it 's more of anything else I 've ever heard about to explain the exasperant imprevebility of the creative process .
A process that , as anyone who I 've been trying to do something -- so , you know , all of course , you know , you don 't compored rationally .
And , in fact , it can sometimes look completely paranormal .
I did this meeting recently meeting with the extraordinary Ruth Stone , who has now 90 years , but he was a poetter for all life and said , in his infold in the rural Virginia , worked out in the camps , and he was in if a poem , when a poem came from the Stian .
He said she was like a fragorous train .
And that was rotolling to her landscape .
It was to get , because he was to tremendous the land under its feet .
He knew he had one thing to do at that point and was of , his words , " run like a match . "
And so he goes to the house and come from this poem , and he wouldn 't have to get a piece of paper and a pencil and a pretty quickly from , as the track and granded it on the page .
Sometimes he couldn 't be enough enough , so he would like to be , so he goes without getting to get to the house and the poem , and she was going to go home and go back and he would continue through the landscape , and she would contined to rope through the landscape , and looking for , like she said , " another poet . "
And then there were those times -- this piece I never forget this piece of times -- there were moments where it was almost losing , OK ?
So , she was running home and searches and searches her passed through , and she was looking at a path in the way that was passing , and then he said , which was like if you flow with the other hand and the coffee .
He was a poem from the tail and remain his body and remain his body and transcscscreaming on the page .
And in these cases , the poem would be presented on the perfect page , but the contrary , from the last word to the first .
So when I heard that I thought -- it 's crazy , it 's exactly the same same same as my creative process .
Not my creative process -- I 'm not a conviction .
I 'm a mulo , and my way to work is ; I wake up at the same orary every day and play play on the bottom .
But even I , in my testing aggin , I 've been paid on that thing , sometimes .
And I guess that many of you the han made .
You know , even if the work and ideas came from a certain source , you can 't walk out of willing .
And what is this ?
And how can we relate it to it in a way that we don 't lose your head , but rather , what do you remain healthy ?
As I 'm about , the best example of contemporary example I have is the Tom Waits musician Waits , which I interviewed several years ago for a newspaper .
We were talking about this , and you know , Tom , for the majorge of life is the incarnation of contemporary remented , looking for control , management , to try to control these species of creative impules .
But then he aged , he was driving on a road in Los Angeles , it changed everything for him .
It was going fast , and all of a traits of this little melody , which comes in in his head as the inspiration , and the wants , elusive and the wants , and the wants , and the deserererve , but it doesn 't know how to take it .
It doesn 't have a piece of paper , it doesn 't have a matt , it doesn 't have a register .
So it starts to feel this kind of old anxioned in him like , " I 'm going to lose , and I 'm going to hold out of this song forever .
I 'm not good enough and I can 't do it . "
And instead of going to go to the panic , and instead .
He was a whole new process and did something completely new .
He just just looked at the sky and said , " Scuses , you don 't see that I 'm driving ? "
" Do it look like that can write a song now ?
If you really want to be there , you go back in a moment , I can take care of you .
Othery , you go to important somebody else today .
You go to disturbing Leonard Cohen . "
And his process changed after that .
Not work , the work was still dark as always .
But the process , and the heavy anxiety that was remaining it when the genius , the genius that was a genius that was handed for anything to do and remaining it back from where , realizing that it didn 't have to be an interized and reminded .
but it 's a very wonderful bizarre collaboration , wonderful bizarre collaboration between Tom and this strange and outside that , but it was not Tom .
So , as I felt that story started to change a little bit , the way I worked and already .
This idea , I rescued when I was writing " Mangia , Prega , Ama , and fadds in one of those cave disperation where we 're working on something and we can 't do it and we can 't start thinking that it will be a disaster , which is never written .
Not just bad , the worst book written .
And I started to think about thrown this project .
But then I reminded about Tom who talked about air and I tried .
So I raised my face on the wild , and I was a comment of my comment-like , the empty of the room .
And I said , " Look , what , both of them , you know , both we know that if this book is not going to be brilliant , no ?
Because I 'm putting all of us all of them , I don 't have any more than that .
So if you want to be better , you have to show you to do your part .
OK . But if you don 't do it , you know what , I don 't do it .
I 'm going to write the same because it 's my work .
And I 'd like to be recorded that I 've presented today to do my part , " Because -- finally , it 's so , OK -- centuries ago in the deserts of the smooth Africa 's deserts were giving for the dances of the moon , and sacred and music until it was on and sacred to the stuff .
And they were magnificent , because the dances were professionals and they were great .
But every time , rarely , something happened , and one of these artists became translated in reality .
And I know you know what I 'm talking about , because I know you all saw , at a performance , a performance .
It was like if the time , and the dancer walked through a kind of landscape and wasn 't a different from the usual , like 1,000 notes , but all the way you were trained .
And of suddenly , it doesn 't look at the same as a human .
But he comes from the diinside and the lights in the divinity of divinity .
And when this was going to happen , in the time , people knew what was , they called him .
They had their hands and start singing , and they started to sing , " Allah , Allah , God , God . "
That 's God , you know .
Curious note -- when the Mori Mori invaded Spain , I prescripy this abitude with them and the pronounced changed in the centuries from " Allah , Allah , Allah , " in the south , " which you can still feel in the corries or in the flames or in the flamp .
In Spain , when a artist has done something impossible and magic , " Allah , , the Allah , " " A. " Well , incomprehensiable , " ununderstood , " incomprehed , " ectable , " A -- a God .
And it 's great because we need .
But the problem comes up the day , for the dancer itself , when you wake up and discover that 's 11 in the morning of Martedesh and the past of God is no longer .
It 's just a great mortal of ginokies , and maybe it will never get it to the height .
And maybe nobody will have the name of God still lighting , and what does it have to do with the rest of his life ?
It 's difficult .
This is one of the most painful recognize to make in creative life .
But maybe it doesn 't have to be so much angoscious if you can 't believe , in the mostly things that are most extraordinary than your being come from yourself .
But you know , just believed that you 're being data in prested by a inimaginable source of this team that you have to go to somebody else when you finished .
And , you know , if we think it 's all changing .
And so I started thinking , and it 's certainly how I thought I was a different time in the work of the book that I 'm going to add on , the dangerous , attesissued , attesissued , the dangerous , attesissues follow my success .
And what I have to continue to go when I feel electured by this is , not that I 'm afraid .
It 's just your work . It 's just your work .
It 's a presenting presenting you for your part , any can be .
If your work is dancing , blap .
If the divine , absurd genius to assigned a decide to leave some kind of wonder , for one moment through your efforts , then , " Ole ! "
Othery , you do the same thing you 're doing .
And " Ole ! " to yourself .
I think it 's got to teach it .
" Ole ! " at the same , even for having human love and testing tackets that will make you continue to show you continuously .
Thank you .
Thank you .
June Cohen : Ole !
As you know , I talked about some of these projects on the human genome , what can mean and on the discovery set of genes .
Now we 're beginning to digitize : we started to digitize biology and now we started to digital biology and now we 're coming from that digital code we 're coming into a new phase of biology , designing and synthetizing life .
We always tried to bring big questions .
" What is life ? " is something that many biologists have tried to understand var levels .
We tried different approaches , reduced it to the minimum terms .
We 're digitizing from almost 20 years ,
When we sequenced the human genome was about passing from the analog of biology in the digital world .
Now we ask us : can regenerate life , or create new life from this digital universe ?
This is the map of a little organism , Mycoplasma genitalium , which is the smallest species of between those who can autoratory in the lab .
And we tried to reduce the genome to create a smaller genome to create one more .
We can eliminate a hundred gene of gene about 500 genes that are here .
But when we look at the mapolic map , it 's relatively simple than our .
I believe that , this is simple .
But when we look at all the genes that we can eliminate , one once once , it 's very unlikely that this can bring to a living cells .
So we decided that the only way to procreates was synthesizing this chromosome way that could be modify the components to bring some of these fundamental questions .
And so we started the adventure of " Can we synthesize a chromosome ? "
Can you contain chemistry to make these big molecules that we never had to create before ?
And , in case , we can give a chromosome ?
A chromosome is just a piece of chromosome .
The speed that we 're able to digitize life is growing at exponential .
Our ability to write the genetic code , instead , progree rather slowly , but it 's better .
And our most recently results the exponential curve .
We started more than 15 years ago .
The process required many passages , starting with a bioethical required before we started experiments .
But we found that synthesize DNA is very difficult .
There are tens of thousands of machines in the world that are producing little segments of DNA , long long , 30 long leck lectural process : the more segment is , the more segment is , more mistakes there are .
So we had to develop a new method to assembly these framments and correct the mistakes .
And this was our first attempt to go from the digital genome , from the digital genome of the X 174 .
It 's a little virus that kills bacteria .
We designed fragments , we actually designed the wrong correction of the wrong wrong and getting a DNA molecule .
The interesting part is when we took this piece of inert chemical material , and we put it in bacteria , bacteria have started reading this genetic code and produring that genetic code and produring viral particles .
The viral particles have been released by cells , they went back and destroyed the E.
I talked about recently with the oil industry saying they 're certainly saying that they have to compresed this model .
They have more than you .
We believe this is a situation where the software can really build its same hardware in a biological system .
But we wanted to do things larger .
We wanted to build the entire chromosome of the bacteria .
They 're more than 580 thousands lecks of genetic code .
So we thought we build it in the size of viruses , so that we can change the cassets to understand what are the components of a living cells .
The design is crucial , and if we start with digital information in a computer , these must be very accurate .
When we sequenced this genome for the first time in 1995 accurattasted was a mistake for every 10 thousands .
We found , resequenced , 30 errors . If we had that original sequence we wouldn 't be able to do it work .
One part of the process is designing 50 lecks that are 50 letting all the other 50 leck leck that they 're going to build underlying smaller subunits to build underlying smaller than working together .
We try to unique elements here .
You probably read that we 're probably sitting that we slums of the fishing .
Think about this , we have a genetic code on four letters : A , C , G and T.
Three of those letters put together with about 20 loters , and there 's a specific order of reading every amminootherwise .
So we can use genetic code to write words , frases , thoughts .
What we did at the beginning was autographed to do that .
Some of them were dollar that was not poem .
We designed these segments to just unit with enzymes .
There are some enzymes that are relying them and put them on .
And we started assembling with parts , starting with segments from five to seven thousands , and smooth , unending them in a way that they can form 72 thousands of leckers in a few days .
So , every step we made these segments in abundance so that we can sequenced them out of creating an extremely robbust -- as you see in a minute .
We 're looking for automatize the process .
So , this seems like the tabellon a lowket playground .
When we get these very long , more than 100 mile basis , they will not grow more directly in the E.
You get to the modern limit of modern biology .
So we looked at other mechanisms .
We knew about another mechanism called the homologue , called the homologa , which in biology is ulessness to repair the DNA to join the segments .
Here 's an example .
This organism , called Deinococcus radiodurs , can absorbate three million radiation .
You can see in the upper square like his chromosome like its core ,
In 12 -- 24 hours , it comes replaced exactly as it was before .
There are thousands of organisms that are able to do that .
These organisms can sit completely .
They can live under empty .
I 'm absolutely of the space in space , and you feel to find new environments of water .
I mean , NASA showed that this is .
This is a picture of the molecule that we built by using these processes , just using this landed , by using the segments that we put segments .
The yeast assemble them automatically .
This picture was not taken with a microscope of electronic microscope , but with a microscope .
It 's a big molecule that we can see with a light microscope .
These are pictures that cost a time of about six seconds .
This is the advertising we did a little time ago .
They 're more than 580,000 letters of genetic code .
It 's the largest molecule of a defined structure that man .
It has a 300 million higher molecular weight .
If you 're passively with a cartoer 10 without spaces , it would like to 142 pages just to transcend this genetic code .
Now , how do we do it work ? How can we do it ?
Obviously , you leave a virus is a game from kids .
It 's a little more complicated when you use bacteria .
It 's easier when it comes from eucariote like our : you can just extract the nucleus and put one one more , which is basically the process of cloning .
In the archaea bacteria , the chromosome is instead of integrated inside the cell , but we recently demonstrated that we 're able to do a little bit complete from one cell to another and activate it .
We clear a chromosome from a microbial species .
The two are different as men from mouse .
We have added some genes more in a way that we can decide what you can decide what this chromosome .
And then I 'm skiing with enzymes that kill all the proteins .
And when we put it in the cell was astonishing -- and you will appreciate our sophisticatoo-- the new chromosome -- the new chromosome , it went into the cell .
And we started thinking that we couldn 't go beyond , but we tried to pay it on there .
This is one of the largest mechanisms of evolution .
We found that a lot of species have added species to have add a second third cromosome , adding in a second thousands of tracts in that species .
So who think about evolution as a gene that has not been a lot of it , he didn 't understand a lot of biology .
There are some enzymes called restriction enzymes that enables like to type DNA .
The chromosome that was in the cell doesn 't have one .
The cell phone chromosome that we put into the core .
It 's expressed , and he recognized the other as expressed material , and it 's been reached , and we found it with only the cell cell and the new chromosome .
It became blue because of the genes we put on .
And in a short lass of time , all the characteristics of a species , went through all the new species , based on the new software that we put in a new species , based on the new software that we put in the cells .
All the proteins have changed , the membranes have changed , and when we read the genetic code , exactly what we 've transferred to .
Now , this might look like genetic alchemy , but altering DNA software , we can change things in a substantial way .
Now , I 've already explained that this is not about genesis -- but of progress from three million years and a half of evolution , and I 've said that maybe we 're going to create a new version of Cambrian explosion in Cambrian explosion in which will be created new species on this digital process .
Why do that ?
I think it 's obvious enough when we think about our needs .
We 're going to go from six and a half billion people in the next 40 years .
Just to give an example : I 've been born in 1946 .
Now there are three people on the planet for each of existing in 1946 , there will be four .
We are having problems now to find food , fresh water and clean , medical water and well-to-and-a-half billion people .
It will be more harsless bills to do it for nine billion .
We use more than five billion carbon carbon , more than 30 billion carbon oil .
That means a hundred million barrel per day .
When we try to find biological processes , or all kinds of process to replace them , it will be a huge challenge .
We have to keep the whole emission of CO2 from these materials that end up in the atmosphere .
At day , thank you to scientific discover all over the world , we have a database with about 20 million genes , and I like to think they 're the designed components for the future .
The electronic industry possible only only one dozen about components , and think about how many different things are coming out .
Our limitations here are data that we 're actually data from biologic and our imagination .
Now we have the techniques , because of these rapid methods of synthesization , in degree of creating what we call combinatory genomics .
We can build a lot of robots that can produce a million chromosomes a day .
Think about these 20 million genes , or many different genes or to provide the processes to produce eightful or drugs , new vaccines , and we can change , thank you very little team , and create more biology now that in the last 20 years of science .
And it 's just a standard selection .
We can choose for survival , check or chemical production or fuel , production of vaccines .
This is an instantaneous instantaneous software that we 're working to be able to sit for the computer .
Well , we don 't necessarily know how it will be .
We know exactly what their genetic code is .
Now we 're focused on the fourth generation of the fourth generation .
You also saw you that extract ethanol was a bad experiment .
We have carbons of second and third generation that are going to be used to be sugar from the higher carbons , like eight-up , or different kinds of butants .
But the only way the biology can have a great impact can have more impact without increasing the cost of food and limitargue the cost of food and limitargument would turn CO2 in matter , and we 're working on design cells that can achieve , and we think we can have the first carburvers of quarters in about 18 months .
Sunlight combined with CO2 is a metodo-- but in our discoveries all over the world , we have found different metods .
This is a organism that we described in 1996 .
He lives in the ocean , about 2,500 feet of the deep-footage temperature in the water temperature .
They create metane from CO2 molecular hydrogen molecular as energy source of energy .
We 're trying to figure out if we can uncanalate CO2 , which can easily be transported through tubes , converting that CO2 in the carburant , to drive this process .
So , short thought we could be able to increase what the basic question of " which is " We , verse the basic question , what 's life is " We , veramentally -- we have the goal of replacing the entire oil industry .
Exactly . If you can 't do it from TED , where can you ?
It would be a main energy source .
And then we 're working for using the same metods to create instantly instantly .
You saw this year with flu , we 're always back in a year and with a dollar , and a dollar when it comes to find the right vaccine .
I think what you can change by building vaccines in table vaccines in ancy .
And that 's how the future might start looking at , now , the evolution of evolution , accellerating evolution with synthetic bacterial bacteria , arches , and then eucariote cells .
We 're at that time to improve people .
Our purpose is to do that in a long enough enough to try to do it . Thank you very much .
First of all , I 'm going to show you , the most rapidly possible , some fundamental work that we took Microsoft in follow a year ago . This is Seadragon .
It 's a place where you can interact is in the local level that remote with a huge amount of visual data .
Here we are many many of the digital pictures of digital photographs with a kind of zoom , for a kind of panoramic veloes , for a panoramic fast , and we have the pictures like we want .
And it doesn 't matter how big the amount of information that we see , how big these things are these collective collective of data or images .
Most are common digital photographs , but this is a scan from the Library of Congress , and it reaches in the range of 300 megapixel .
It doesn 't make any difference because the only thing that the prestations of a system like this is the number of pixel on your screen in any time . It 's also a very flexible architecture .
This is a book , an interior example of data not images .
This is the Casa desolate Dickens . Each colony represents a capital .
So to show you that it 's just about text and not images , we can do something like that , to actually see that it 's a real real representation of the text , not a picture .
It could be a way a little artificial to read an electronic book .
I don 't know it .
This is a more realistic example . It 's a number of The Guardian .
Every big image is the beginning of a section .
And it really gives you the pleasure of reading the real cartable version of a magazine , or a daily newspaper , which is for nature moltex .
We also did something with the corner of this number in particular of The Guardian .
We created a higher resolutionary , higher resolutionary than what you use in a normal advertising -- and we put it in the content .
If you want to see the characteristics of this automobile , you can see them here .
Or other models , or even the specific specific techniques .
And this really shows some of these ideas to eliminate the boundaries of space on the screen .
I hope that this means to put in a pop-up and other porcheries like , no longer to be necessary .
Of course , the most obvious mapping is one of the most obvious applications for this kind of technology .
And on this is not going to lose time , if we don 't say we have contribute to even this field .
These are all the streets in the U.S. I 'm going to be over a geospace .
So we 're going to go to something else .
This is actually the alive on the Web ; you can go to the web .
This is a project called Photosynth , which combine two different technologies .
One is Seadragon and the other is a visual research that was a visual computer research that was made by Noah , a student of the University of the University of the UW Seitz 's UW Szz and Rick Szeliski of Microsoft Rick Szeliski Rick . An n n n n n n n .
And it 's from the alive on the web , managon the Web .
You can see that when we do this kind of screen , where we can go from one image to the other and have this kind of experience of multiple resolution .
But the space collocation of pictures has actually a meaning .
The computer algorithms of computer visualization , they recorded these pictures together , so that they recognize these things together , so you 've been taken close to Grases on on Montagne Rockies on Montagne Rockies -- you 're taken . Here , you see the elements of a slide , or the panorthy show , and these things were all lines .
I don 't know if I have time to show you some other environment .
There are some of them are much more spaces .
I want to go directly to one of the original data of Noahs data -- and this comes from a very prototype of Photosynthrown that we did work for the first time , to show you what I think is really the key key to show you what I think is really the key key to do is is the key key to behind this technology , the Photosyntheshic technology .
We had to worry about legal aspects and on the saying .
This is a reconstruction of Notre Dame images of Flickr . Basta digites Notre Dame , Flickr and you get pictures of the sorts and the pictures of the campus and so on . Each one of these orange orange areas represents to a picture that 's discovered to this model .
So they 're all linked images from Flickr and they 're all linked to the space level in this way .
And you can navigate this very simple way .
You know , I wouldn 't have thought to end work for Microsoft .
It 's very gratificating you get this kind of accovery here .
I think you can see that it 's a lot of different kinds of fotowns : from the cell phones to those professional SLR , a number meaningful number , put together in this environment .
And if I can , I try to try to find more strange .
Many of them are faces , etc .
Somewhere you have a series of photographs -- there 's a series of photographs -- it .
This is a poster of Notre Dame recorded correctly .
We can go from posters to the physics of this environment .
The essential point is that we can do things with social environment . This is now taking data from supply the whole memory of how it looks like the land , from the view of what the Earth looks like , from visual point of view -- and links to all those data together .
All those pictures become connected together , larger than the summers of the parts .
You have a model of the land that emerges .
Think about this as a prolungation of Stephen Lawler on Earth .
It 's something that grows in complexity as well as people who are using it , and the advantages for the use .
Their pictures are husbands with inseries on other people .
If you get somebody to get the idea of contrassigning all these sorts of dicating the name , my picture of Notre Dame suddenly , the picture of all those data , and I can use as a point of entertainment , and I can use how to be in that metaphimself in that metapuniverse , using the picture of anyone else , and have a kind of a kind of social experience of cross-user and cross-user experience .
Now , of course , a consequence of all the interesting virtual models , all of the interesting part of the land , collective and not only you know you 're going to open up and satellite images and satellite images and similar pictures and similar pictures and similar pictures .
Milles .
Chris Anderson : I understand ? What your software is going to take us to do is that at a certain point , in the next few years , all of the world 's next few years , all of the world 's going to be empowered together ?
BAA : Yes . What 's doing is basically , you know .
It 's creating hyperlink , if you want , between images .
And it 's doing it in the content of images .
The thing becomes very interesting if you think about wealth of semantement information that many of these pictures have .
As you 're making a picture of images , you type a sentence and the text on the web page has a lot of information about pictures .
Now , what happens if that picture you links all your pictures ?
So the amount of semantic interconnection and the amounts of riches that comes out is really enormous . It 's a classic effect of the network .
CA : Blaise , it 's really incredible . Compliments .
BAA : I thank you very much .
One of the main pleasure that when you travel and one of the thetnographic research is the way we can live between who has not forgotten the antic traditions , between the wind , the past in the wind , the toothwl 's leap in the stone leaves in the leaves of plants .
Bastes think that the sciamans Jaguar , or the Milky Way , or the monitors of Inuit are still colms of meaning , or in Himalayas , the buddists still inlow the breath of the Dharmful Dma , to remind the central importance of anthropology , and that the idea that the world that we live in sense , but it 's just a model of reality , but it 's just a model of reality ,
the consequence of a particular adaptative choices that our estrace has done , well or evil , many generations .
And , of course , we all sharing the essential traits .
We all go . We all try .
We are subjects in the initiation .
We have to death the unesorability of death , so we don 't surprisingly if we 're going to be able to saft .
We all have an art .
What hits is the particular particular rhythm of song , the rhythm of dance .
It doesn 't matter that are the Penan inforests of the Borneo , or the follow of the Vodoo 's Vodoo 's desert in Kenya Saharsut in Kenya , or a settle in the heart of the Sahara .
He was my journey in the desert a month ago , or a yak bulk in the Keep valles 's valleys of the world .
All these people teaching us that there are other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , other ways of moving in the world .
And , if you think , you think , it 's a concept that can give you hope .
To together , the myriaths of the world 's cultures create a spiritual life and cultural life that is the world for well-being , and it 's important for well-being of the planet as biosphere .
And you can think of this cultural reaches like an etnosphere and you can define the total sum of all concepts , dreams , mites , ideas , inspiration , mites , ideas , intuitions laughed to be from the human imagination from the respective of human alone ,
The etnosphere is the fantastic patrial of humanity .
It 's the symbol of what we are and what we can be in how polluty .
And because biosphere was gravally consumed as as a tremendous as it was as a tremendous , very quickly .
Nobody biologist , for example , 50 percent of all species is on the orders just have been or the orders just because it 's fake , or -- in the most apocalm issues -- in the most apocalm ispocalm , in the field of biological diversity .
The index of that is , of course , language loss .
When you were born 6,000 languages on this planet .
A language is not only composed by a vocabular or a series of rules .
A language is the sprayment of the human spirit .
It 's the half of all culture comes in the material of every culture comes in the material world .
Each language is a forest , a bacin the mind , a thought , a thought , a thought , a reecosystem possibility .
And of those 6,000 languages , as we 're in the sign in Monterey , at least half the comes not sustained in the children .
They 're no more teaching children , which means , unless you have something , which means , unless you have something that are already death .
What is there more sad than being you have silence , the last thing to talk about the first language , the world 's not a way to transport the wisdom of the sandwidth of the promise of children ?
This is a phoning that has been of someone in the world every two weeks : every two weeks a old man and door , with them in the last sillables and door in the tombs of a sillar language .
And I know somebody you 're going to say , " isn 't it much better ?
The world wouldn 't be a better place if I talk about all the same language ? " Benissim , then we talk all yoruba . We talk about the Canese .
We talk about kogue .
You will take a tract thing that means that we can 't talk about their own language .
I 'd like to give you a trip through the etnosphere --
a little journey in ethnosphere to give you a gift of what we 're losing .
Most of us forget that when I say , " different ways of existing ways of existing .
We take for example this Barasana Barasana , in the settnake , the people of anadiowaves , which creates the myth-creates the myth-creates of snake slatte in the west snake slaten snake .
It 's a people who are not able to distinguish color blue from the green because the time , the rest of the forest , which depends the population depends .
They have a strange language and a matrimonial rule , called " existic language , " " " you have to marry one person who talks about different language .
This is all the way in the past mitological , supply , the particularity is that in these existence , in these existence , in these existence , which is that in these existence , mists , one language .
They 're just going to listen and then start talking .
We take one of the most interesting tribes I lived , the Waorans of Ecuador north , an incredible popular people who had the first contact contact contact in 1958 .
In 1957 , five missionaries have been trying to make a mistake .
They did down the photographs that they thought they 'd think they 'd have to think that they 'd have been given that this population of pluvial forest never seen anything .
They collected the photoes , they turned them to find a shape or a shape and , not finding anything , they 've concluded that they were about the hell , and they killed the five missioners with the lance .
But Waorans didn 't kill the strangers .
They killed among them .
54 percent of the mortality was caused by themselves .
We went up eight generations and we found two cases of natural morath and we found two natural morath , and when we insisted it , they had a lot of them , and then killed it killed it same .
The hunters were able to recognize the animal urine animal urine , and recognize the species .
In the early ' 80s , I had been assigned a very interesting task when the Harvard professor asked me if I was going to go to Haiti to sweet the base of Duvalier and Tonton Macoutes , and the Tonton Macoutes , and I would have a very interesting task of the poison the bottom of the veils .
To give a sense of miracolost , I would have to understand Vodoun culture , and that Vodoo is not magic .
It 's quite a complex metaphysical vision of the world .
Very interesting .
If I ask you to say to the great religions of the world , what would you say ?
Cristianism , Islam , Buddhim , Ebraism , etc .
One continent is always left out , thinking that sub-Saharan Africa doesn 't have any religious fabricous . And yes and Vodoo is not the other than the distilside of these religious concepts of nation that 's deep slavordered .
What makes the interesting voodoo is the intense relationship between life and death .
So , I saw the spirits are hidden .
The spirites can be invocated by the Great Acqua , they response to the rhythm of dance and replaced temporary of the face of the face of the way that for a short moment that for an active , and they 're the god .
So , for this voodoost , you white go to church with God .
We give them in the temple and we say God . "
And from the moment you 're married , is the spirit that you 're driving , how can you do it ?
So you have these incredible events : follow in the fact that you can touch voodoo in the state of trance that touch impuntizons of the mind when it 's catalyzed in a state of extreme exciting .
In all the people with which I 've lived the most extraordinary Kogi of Sierra Nevada is Santa Marta , in the Santa Marta , in the Santa Marta 's Colombia .
Desscending the ancient civilization that once they lived on the caraibic Colombia in the conqueness , the people would retreat the vulcanic massive , which is ritized on the vulcanic planning .
In a continent macked continent smacked , this people has never been conquisted by the Spanish .
So , they 're governmented by a clergliner , but their formation is really extraordinary .
The young people follows come out of the families to three or four years , and live secret in a world that 's made of dark and shadows in the bottom of the glaciers for 18 years .
Two double years of proposes of reproduce the nine months of management that spend in the user of the mother , they 're metaphorically in the Grande Mother .
For all this time , they 're acculturate to the values of their society , values that predicts and only their prayers , and only their prayers , or to say the balance of the cosmic balance .
At the end of this incredible initiation , they 're suddenly bring out and for the first time in their life , at the age of 18 years , they see an above the first ball , when the sun is the sun value of the first blood value , everything they learned in theory . The first thing they learned in theory . The prete a step back and say , the predict of going back and say , "
" Women ? I think I said ,
It 's amazing . Now it 's to you protect it . "
They 're called the major brothers and say that we , the minor brothers , we are the destruction of the world .
This level of intuition is extremely important .
When we think about the Ingengengene and environment invote Rousseau and the old story of will-noble , which is a razer concept in its simplicity or maybe we 're more closer to the Earth of us .
The Ingenen popular is not no fefeeling or feelings .
There 's no space for these things in malaries of malaries or the Asmat the winds of Tibet , but thank you for time and the rage , they created a mystical intuition of the Earth 's not about the concept of human beings .
What does that mean ?
It means that a little child of the Ande who grows up believing that the mountain is a spirit of Apu who will lead his destiny is a different human being a different human being human being a different human being , and it will have a different relatively with the mountains or a place of the Montana is growing that a mountain both of rock and skeeps on a mountain mass of rock ready to be avated .
That 's a mineral one is a mineral or a mineral cutting is irrelevant .
What 's interesting is the metaphor that defines the relationship between individual and the natural world .
I grew up in the forests of the Britannica credating that forests were cutting to be cut .
This resives me a human being different from my friends Kwautl who believes that the forests are the Hamkuk 's dise and the blind 's histories that live in the wild of the world , the spirits that will live in the well-initiation Hamatsa .
If you start to look at these cultures can create different reality , you can start to understand some of their sense of feelings . We take this plant .
I took this picture to open up in the nordoctors .
Mayahuash , maybe some of you 've heard of the psychopics , the most powerful substance of the monthly psychoptic subject .
What makes the fascinating the ayahuash is not the pharmacological potential of the substance , but its elaboration . It 's composed by two elements .
On one side , this land-a-launch that has a series of beta-carboline , harmolines , harmful , harmmolines .
Take the only plants , you have a bluststage that altery a little bit of consciousness , but it 's measured with leaves of a coffee family said Psychotria , a vision of coffee ,
This plant plant has powerful powerful tripptamine , very similar to the sert of dimethyltryptamine-5 , a methylptamine .
If you ever see Yanomtiring on the nose of the hidden that they do a different set of set , they 're contains methoxptamine .
Tiring that powder for the nose is a little bit like being disparated by a sload of paper dipinpoints and land on an electricity . Risate not a distorsion of the electricity ; it creates the dissolution of reality .
I was often with my professor , Richard Evan Shultes , the man who has been psychedelic , with his discovery of the fungi of the hallucinogenic fungi in the 1930s in Mexico .
In my way my way , you can 't get these tripptamines like hallucinogens because you can 't tell anyone of being hallucinated . You can 't tell anyone of being hallucinated . But the tripamine allowed by a enzyme that you can 't have killed by a enge enjoy .
It 's possible to be in the only only only if you 're killed with other chemicals that you know , " MAO .
Now it comes the beautiful : Tibeta-carboline , which are in this lianibers of MAO , the same type of the same type of potential to potential tripptamines . The question spontaneous , like these people found out in two deogically not , but that if you combine in this , they create a biocheck version of biochemical version that 's sound like , they 're making biochemistry ?
We use the great eupherror of the proof and the mistake , which can reveal unveal .
But if you ask the Indians , they will say , " Please . "
What does that mean ?
This tribes , the Cofan , has 177 variety of ayahuass , who are narely in the forest , and that in our eyes would remain the forest .
If you ask them , how they 're going to say , " I said , " I thought , " I was thinking , " I was thinking , " No . "
The solution is : you take the 17 variety of a full l-fairly and each will sing with a different tone .
With this doesn 't graduate in Harvard , but it 's much more interesting to count the stams .
Now , the problem is that even the problem is that even the ones of us who have to heart people who have painting in the India that are paintings , but somehow reducts to the margins of the history of the respect to our real world , and pass beyond .
In fact , the 19th century , in 300 years , it will not remind for its wars or the technologic innovations , but rather as the thing that we were in actively or accepted , or accepted accepted or accepted passively or accepted passively or accepted passively , the problem is not change .
All cultures through the centuries have been involved in a new life possibility of life .
And the problem is not technology .
The Sioux , the Sioux , they don 't have stopped to be Sioux when they put them out of being Americans have no Americans have when they put up and ceat .
It 's not the change or the technology that threatening the integrity of the etnosphere . It 's the power .
The flight of the domination .
And if you look at the world , you 'll find that these are not destinated cultures that these are not destinated cultures .
They 're living and dynamics and dynamics outside from existence to force identifies that go beyond their capacity to adaptation .
I know you 're disboscation in the Penan of the Penan --
a people who have a Sarawak , in the Sarwest Asian , a popular that lived in free to a generation , and now reduced to a generation ago , and now reduced to the revers of the rivers of the rivers , where you can see the rivers sees of the slobe that seems to be able to Meridional Meridional Merian , where you can see the smart of the globe ,
It 's going to fill up the stuns with the dream of the forest .
Or , in the case of the Yanomami , are the disease that have come with the discovery of the gold .
If we move on on on the mountains of Tibet , where I 'm doing a lot of research , you 'll see the during flight of political domination .
Like you will know the genocide , the physical extinction of a popular , but the ethnocide , the destruction of the estyle of life of a popular , not only is convicted , because it 's not only convicted , because it 's a part of the strategy of development .
And you can 't understand the suffering of Tibet until you go from the beginning .
I 've been through 6,000 miles from Chengdu in Western Chengdu , through Tibet sourcing , and coming in in Lhasa with a young colleague , but only come to Lhasa , I realized what the statistics is that we feel .
6,000 sacres reduced in powers and cenables .
1.2 million people killed by military military during the Cultural Revolution .
The dad of this guy was ascritical to the Panchen Lama .
which means that it was killed in the temple of the Chinese invasion .
His swear with Santity in Santity during the diaspora that has taken the people in Nepal .
His mother was imprigioned and his colpe was to be rich .
It was brought to hide at the age of two years hidden under his gonna because it couldn 't have any of him .
The sister , who did the same , he did the same , was put in reeducational field .
A day he inavailable day a sent , he had a coffeigant , and for this transgression , was put it in seven years .
The Tibet of Tibet is unoverlable , but the spirit of the people 's popular is from teners .
And then , all the way you reduce a choice .
We want to live in the monothoonia or we want to accover the world poly-to-boundary of diversity ?
The great anthropologists Margaret Mead , before he said that his biggest fear was that , in our way to go to this view of the world , not only to see the entire range of the world 's imagination to a limited modality of human imagination , but a day we 're going to see from a sleep to be more possibilbilbilities .
And it 's umillion of remembering that our species is existed for 600,000 years .
The Neolitics Revolution , who gave us the agriculture , which has done us subcure , which has done us subject of the skid , by creating the shaman of the skid , and we talk about 10,000 years ago .
The modern world 's industrialized has 300 years .
That shares history doesn 't suggests that we have the answers that we have the answers that we 're going to have to address in millennia to come .
When they 're these miriaching cultures of the world is asked what it means to be human , they 're responding with 10,000 different voices .
And it 's in these answers that we all have the possibility of being what we are : a kind of a conscious , which has to make all the people and all the gardens can fire . And there are great moments of optimism .
I took this picture on the northern extremity of Baffin the island of Baffin the whales of Inuit , and this man , Olayas , and this man , Olayas , Olayas , he told me the wonderful story of his grandfather .
The Cananada government was not always gentle with the Inuit and in the 1950s to stabilize our supremise , we have to colonies .
The grandfather of this man refuted to go .
The family , I teeds her life , and took them off all the guns , and all its tools .
You have to know that Inuit doesn 't temon the cold , they exploit .
The pacins of sleds in origin were made of swear fish in the skin .
The grandfather of this man didn 't even go from the Arctic , or from the library that suffering .
It 's sgyolated , he calculated the pantalone in the skin and defecated in their hand . When I fuck them , they worked a text .
It 's sprying on the points of this haunt hit and when it came solid , he killed a dog .
It took a skied dog and created a brilliant , with the toy cases created a sleep , he immed another dog and it 's disappeared on the bank , hit in the bank , it in the hands .
We want to talk about cavarsely with nothing ? [ Raiate ] . And this , in different ways , [ Applastic ] is the symbol of resilience of the Inuit and all the indigenous popular people of the world .
In the aprile 1999 , the Canadian government reached the total control of an area of an area of the larger world 's larger than California and Texas mitted together .
It 's their new patria . It 's called Nunut .
It 's an independent territory . They will controlder all the mineraries .
One of the splendidate of how a natione-state can recognize with his people .
And , to finish , I think it 's pretty obvious at least in those remote areas of us in these remote argument of the planet , realization that they 're not remote .
For somebody 's home .
They represent several human imagination that return the dawn . And for all of us , the dreams of these children , they become part of our children , become part of the cloud of hope .
And finally , we of National Geographic we convinced that politicians will never come to anything .
I think the polemimic --
[ Applausi is not persuasive , but we believe that stories can change the world , and maybe we 're the best institution to tell the stories of the world . EEEEEEvery month of our website . Every month of the month has 35 million visit .
156 countries spring our television channel .
Our magazines are thrown from millions .
Our work is to travel in ethnosphere to bring our audience in places that are going to go out of how they have seen and , you will have seen as well , they 're hoping , abbraced , and , they will be able to get the central reveal of diversity , and we have to find a life in a world of pluralist and we have to find a life in a plural world and multicultural and multicultural life in a world 's life in a plural and we have to find a life in a life in a life in a world 's life in a pluralist and we can can
where the wisdom of all the people can contribute to our collective well-being .
Thank you .
I 'm going to talk about some things that I wrote in this book that I hope you 've heard and I 'm going to try to see some links , in case , you don 't see them .
I want to start with what I call the official dogma official dogma .
The official dogma of what ?
The official dogma of all the Western industrial society . The official dogma " " " " If we want to massive well-being of our citizens . "
The reason is , from one side , in fact that freedom is in itself a value , is predictious , is a useful , essential for human beings .
At the other is that if we are free , each of us can act for the same thing that the massive well-being , without any of you decide , no one that I decided in name .
The way to massive freedom is massive .
More choices people have , more are free , and more , and more , the more of them is their well-being .
This , I think , is so deeply radical in society that no one would have to be able to put it in doubt .
And it 's also rooted in our lives .
I 'm going to show you some examples of what progress has made possible .
This is my supermarket . It 's not particularly big .
I lose a simple note on condments .
In my supermarket , there are 175 conditions , without contention 10 variety of extrags of oil and 12 aceters that you can buy for the mastance of the 175 pronaires that you can buy the circumstance that nobody of the 175 pronais-ready is your degree .
That 's how the supermarket .
And then you go to the stereo to buy a stereo : CD lector , radio , radio , plaright , the amplificator .
And in this single smooth , there 's a big number of components of audiences .
We can do six and a half million different combinations using the components that there are in one store .
You have to admit that there is a lot of choice .
Other fields : the world of communications .
Once , when I was a child , you could get all the desirable phone services , unless unlikely that were fornites from mama Bell .
You had the phone , you didn 't buy it .
One consequence of that , between the other , was that the telephone never would never break .
These days , they went .
Now we have a variety of telephones , especially between mobile phones .
Here 's the cell phone .
My favorite is the one in the middle , MP3 , cut , and housees for the bruln-up , and the horders for me bruln-up .
If you don 't have it yet seen in the shop under the house , you 're handed to be .
And what happens is that people come in in the shoots and ask this question . And you know , you know what the answer is ? The answer is " No . "
It 's not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn 't do too much .
So , in other aspects of life that are much more important than the aquers , you have the same same blosion of choices .
Assistence health : no more in the United States that you go from the doctor and say , doctor you have to do .
Instead , you go to the doctor , and the doctor says , " OK , we could do A , or B , " has these benefits and risks . What do you want to do ? "
You say , " Doc , what should I do I do ? "
And the doctor says , " You have these benefits and these risks , and B has these benefits and sets . "
" What do you want to do ? "
And you rebits : " Dose if she was me , what would do ? "
And the doctor : " But I 'm not . "
The result of the result of the malated autonomy , expression that makes it look like a nice thing .
But it 's not that a disruping the weight and responsibility to make decisions .
There 's a huge marketing of drurug products , direct to people like me and you , that if you think , it 's not a sense , because we can 't buy them .
But if we can 't buy them , why do you get public ?
The answer is that they want you to call the domorning , we call the doctor to ask them to change the recipe .
Something that 's so fundamental identity is a question of choice , as you see in this wild , " we don 't want to force children . We 're going to cause their sex at time . " We don 't get more an identity : we have to invent it .
And we can reinvent how many times we do it .
which means that every morning , at the rising , you have to decide that kind of person you want to be .
Trise to the family and marriage , a time perspective , a common time , which was that you were married to anyone , was that you were married to the more soon possible , and you start to have the more soon possible .
The only real choice was with who , not when , and even what to do after .
Ose , it 's really about play .
I teach students very smart students , and I do 20 percent in less than a time .
And it 's not because they 're good less , not because they 're less diligent .
but why I 'm impensive , intent to ask , " Would I have to marry or not ? " I should be able to do that now ? "
" Would I say to married more later ? " I have to think before I was children or career ? "
They are interrogatives .
And they try to answer these questions , even if this implessness not to do the compete that check and I teach my aren 't getting a beautiful vote to my examples .
And they really have to do it . They 're important .
Now , the work : we are lucky , like Carl underolyers , because technology allows us to work every minute , every day , every corner of the planet , except that from the Hotel Randolph .
I 'm talking about , there 's a corner , and I don 't tell anyone , where the WiFi works .
I don 't tell you , because I want to use it .
What does this mean , this incredible freedom of choice that we have to do about work ? It 's that we have to be decide , continuously in every moment , if we have to work or not .
We can go to see our son playing hot , with cell phone in a pockberry , Blackberry in the other , and the notebook , pically , on the cell , picks .
And even though they 're all spents , every minute that we see our son ruining the partners , we 're also asking this , " Did I have to answer this called ? "
" I have to answer this for ? I have to get this letter ? "
And even when the answer is no , " " all this makes the experience of your game of very different from what would be in other conditions .
So anywhere we look at all , little , big , big , materials and large materials , life is a question of choices .
Once the world was this : Ovation , there were some possibilities , but it wasn 't a question of choice .
The world is today looks like this : The dilemma is , " Is it a good thing , or negative ? "
The answer is Same answer is .
The positive laten you know , so I 'm going to talk about negatives .
This is all this choice compories two effects of negative effects on people .
The first , paradoxically , is that produced paralysis that produced paralyslowed .
With a toptions between which chooses , becomes very difficult to do it .
I give you an example of a conduct : a conduct plans .
A connected of a vananger to the Vanguard data , the giant source society , with about a million clients in 2,000 companies .
What she found is that for every 10 solutions that are actually offered in more , the percentage of two percent .
With 50 offers source , there 's 10 percent in less than adhhesions than five . Why ?
Because with 50 fources between which choosing , is maledtly difficult to decide , and the choice comes sent .
And tomorrow , and we tomorrow , tomorrow , tomorrow , and of course , we 're never going to come .
You know , it doesn 't mean that these old work from old who are going to eat food for the decision is so that they will lose enough money , they also lose the complete sources of the dators of work .
They 're not participating , they 're losing up to five thousand dollars per year from the work , which would be willing to be disposed to them .
So paralysis is a consequence of having too many choices .
And I think that makes the world like that .
" And to finish , for ethchup , " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " "
You 'd just take the right decision , if it 's for ethernity , right ?
You don 't want to choose the wrong fundamental condition .
So this is the first effect . The second is that even if we can avoid paralysis and make a choice , we 're less satisssatisfied by the result of how we were with less options in which choose .
And this for different reasons .
One of these is that with many conditions between which choosing , if you buy one and it 's not quite easy , it 's easy to imagine that you could have done a different choice that would be . And what happens is that the alternative imagined that you might have been better . And what happens is that the alternative imagination , and the replace as the rest of the respair .
even when it was a good decision .
The more choices you have , more easy dislifeeling than any detail that 's unababsolutely unabled by the choice .
And then there 's what economists call cost cost cost .
Dan Gilbert asked a very well stamattaine like the value that we give things things on .
Over the rest , when there are many options , it 's easy to represent the features of the alternative , and be less satisatis-dissatives and being less satisfied .
Here 's an example . I 've all schools I 'm not New York .
But that 's what you probably think you 're probably thinking .
There 's this couple to the Hamptons .
A place of lussian place .
It 's all about splendida . It 's all about them .
It doesn 't lack . But what he thinks is , " Well , the daytion , is Agotten . "
" All my neighbors in Manhattan is on . "
" I could talk about the right right home . "
And it goes two weeks I 've been losing -- every day -- every day -- the possibility of parking where it wants .
The expensive opportunity decrease for what we have , even when choice was excellent .
And the other the options that we have to look at the characteristics will be re-return to how expensive .
Here 's another example .
This is telling us a lot of things .
It 's talking about the life , and maybe living slowly .
But the most important point is that anything you choice , you go down to 't do other .
The things that we don 't choose are active attractive attractive that can make less attractive what we do .
Third point : the spiral of expectations .
I tried it on my skin buying a new jeans .
I 'm almost jeans .
Once the jeans were just a guy , you buy and sleep besty , they were uncomfortable , and they were smares , just after having them a life and work a lot of times , they were going to go well .
So , I went to buy a couple when the old ones were gone , and I said , " I need a jeans , this is my cutting . "
And he said , " Lake wants slim , the fit , axed , axed , amaxed , like a fit ? "
He wants them to be with the cernier or the bottons ? " Stonewashed " or " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " Stonewashed " ? " Stonewashed " " " " "
" Loook do you like ? "
" Do you want to take them or stretch ? Bla blaws -- " Continured it .
I was skies , and after a while I was able to say , " I want the guy that was the only guy , " I want to say , " It didn 't have any idea what it was , so for a time , I tried to all jeans , and I got out of the mile , I gave the best jeans that I ever had .
It was the massive . With all that choice I had the best .
But I felt worse .
Why ? I wrote a whole book for understanding that .
The reason I was worse for is that with all that choice the whole choice of my expectations were very high , jeans had to be perfect .
I was at the beginning , I was expectations . I didn 't expect anything exceptional when there was 100 different steps , accidents , at least , steps , like to be perfect .
What I had buy was good , but not perfect .
After I had a paragoned that choice with what I was trying to do , I was unsatisfied with expectations .
The addition of options in the life of people don 't do that increases that these have respect to the excellence of options .
And this will also produring satisfaction , even when the results are good .
Nobody in marketing if you realize it .
Because if they knew , you wouldn 't know what I 'm talking about .
The truth looks more like this .
" It was better when it was worse , " The reason that was better when it was worse was that when you were worse was even possible to meet some surprised pleasure of the pleasure pleasure .
Over the world in which we live in -- opulent , industrialized citizens with expectancy of the expectancy of the expectations that we can hope is that things are at the altitutions .
You never have surprised pleased because your expectations , my expectations , you 're unababled .
The secret of happiness -- what you 're here -- is , " Baxis you expectations . "
I mean , the little whose things -- I really have married and my wife is really amazing .
I couldn 't have done , I couldn 't have any accounted .
But it 's not always a bad thing .
And then , one consequence of the buying a couple of jeans when there is only that kind of jeans is that when you 're not satisssatisfied , and you ask you , " Why ? "
" Who responsible ? " , the answer is clear .
The world is responsible . What could I do you do with us ?
When there are hundreds of kinds of jeans , and you buy one unsatisfacing , and ask you who ask you who is responsible , is the close , it 's the close , you 're in your own .
You could have done better .
You have some of these things that are available for insuccess .
So when people take decisions , even if the result is solid , they feel unsatives , they feel unababsolutely dissatives and give the hit to them .
In the last few years , the depression is exploded in the industrialized world .
I think a factor -- not the only one , but important -- not the only , but important -- of this wave of depression is that people have deludents because standards are too high .
And when they have to explain this situation think that the colpe is they think .
So the final result is that we 're better , objectively , but we feel worse .
Let me remember you .
This is the official dogma , what we all take for good and it 's completely fake . It 's not true .
There 's no doubt that a little bit of choice is better than to have any good than having it , but it doesn 't take a lot of choice is better than a little bit .
There 's a critical value , magic . I don 't know what it is .
But I 'm sure we 've been enough of course , by a piece of level where choices are better .
Now , from the political point of view -- I almost finished -- from political point of view , the peat is the following .
And what allows this whole choice in the industrial society is the material wealth .
There are many places in the world , and you know , you know the problem is not that they have any choice .
The problem is they have too poor .
So the factory that I 'm talking about is a malbeing exusive to modern , rich societies of Western .
And what it does deprespress and climbing is this : Steve Levitt Levitt talked about how expensive and discoseats for bimbers are unuseful . It 's a sprec of money .
I mean these choices , complicated and dispendies , it 's not that they 're just unuseful .
I 'm addicted of the dollar .
They 're going to be worse .
If a little bit of what in our society is allows a lot of choice was reversed in those where people have too few possibilities , it would not only their life to improve but our own life .
This is what economists call a paretian improving improving .
A redistribution of income redistributtion is all good -- not only to the poor -- because of this choice in excess that it 's going to us .
So , to conclude , " Bill , you can become everything you want " --
You , people in culture , you think , " What does that fish ? "
" It 's obvious that you can 't make anything in a wiring box . "
" A imagination castrated , a world limited view of the world -- "
and I 'm going to have it so , at the beginning .
But then , I realize that , instead , I realized that that that that the fish knows longer .
Because the reality of the fact is that if you send in frantum , so that " everything is possible , " you can 't get freedom . You get the paralysis .
If you break the bottom of the bottom of all of the rest of the satisfaction .
You can take the paralysis , and you reducing wells .
They all need a sphere .
This is almost certainly too strick , maybe even for the fish , and certainly for us .
But the absence of a few symbolic symbolic symbol is a recipe for the ruin .
Thank you very much .
