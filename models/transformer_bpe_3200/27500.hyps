Last year I showed these slides to demonstrate that the soon cket , which is almost three million years ago , which is about about the size of 48 .
But this subvalue the gravity of the problem because it 's not the conversation of the problem .
The arcethic hot is , in a sense , the clean , the heart of the global climate system .
You expand it winter and retreat .
The next slide will be a rapid carried in the last 25 years .
The packs are made in red in red .
And as you see , they expand until the blue wall .
That 's the ice in the winter , which is riter-winter .
You can see that cosidamage , five years or more , is like blood , which is like blood , which is the blood , which is the body .
In 25 years , it 's been past , at this time .
This is a problem because the heat at at the ocean ice ice ice ice around the ocean where there are huge amounts of carbon congelated with the ocean , and leaves , they 're transformed in the microbes .
And it turns out that it 's totality to global warming , that amount of global warming could doubled , overoveroveroveroverall this point of not return .
In some short , in Alaska a half a focus on the metane is already rebolling out of the water .
The professor of the University of Alaska University of Alaska team , I got a team in a focused last last last last last last last last last last last night .
Video : Wow ! Al Gore : Wow ! The question is if we 're going to be .
One reason is that this exchange change early measuring the Groenland from the north .
This is a river of the glacial regime .
The landed never had reached levels .
This is the Kangerlussuaq , in the west of the Groenland .
If you want to know how to be the level of the sea for the leavor of the raferred on the ground , here is where the sea .
These current currently .
On the other side of the planet : Antarctle , the largest block of the planet .
The last month scientists have dequing that the bilanxist of the ice is in the negative , and that the Western Antarctica , which poges on some islands on some islands in the month .
It 's six to six feet of the sea level of the boat , like Groenland .
The Himalayas , the third largest block of ice , you see new laghi , which few years ago , they were ice .
40 percent of the world population is half of the world 's population that leavailable .
Sulle Ande : this ice is the source of the water source of this city .
The luck is increased .
But when you 're decreasing , the same happens to the water .
In California , the newwwwish is decrease 40 percent diminuity .
The idrical kins are in crisis .
The predictions , like you 've read , you 're good .
The growing secustomed in the world leads to a remarkable increase .
The environmental disaster is increasing out of the normal and without precedented .
Four times more numeroes in the last 30 years , respect to 75 .
This is a whole unsustainable .
If you look at the context of the context , they can see the consequences .
In the last five years we 've added 70 million tons of CO2 every 24 hours -- 25 million tons in the ocean every day .
Look at attactivity of the eastern Pacific , to the west , to the west , and both both parts of the continent , where there 's a rootal impoverty .
The major because of global warming , together to deforestation , which is 20 percent , is the use of fossil fuel combustible fuel .
The oil is a problem , and coal is even worse .
The United States is one of the two countries with more emissions , together to China .
And he proposes to build a lot of other carbon dioxide .
But we 're seeing a way of direction .
These are the anullated projects in the last few years and some high-alternative proposes .
Every way , there 's a political lower in our country .
The carbon industry and oil have spent 250 million dollars in the last year to promote carbon , which is a oxide , which is a oxide .
And that picture remembered me something --
Natal , in the Tennessee , where I live , there was a 3.8 billion lights lights of carbon spaces .
Mayyou 've seen it on the news .
This is the second largest flow of last America in America .
It 's happened around Natal .
The remarkable of one of the carbon industry was this .
Video : Sit . Frosty the carbon is a kind of allegro and happy .
It 's abundant here in America , and grow our economy .
Frosty carbon is more and more clean .
It 's good price , adorable and working on the wild .
Al Gore : From here is a lot of the West Virginia .
The biggest mineral society on the mountain is Massey Coal at . This is his administrator .
Video : Don Blakenship : Sweclear -- Al Gore , Nancy Pelous , Harry Reid -- they don 't know what they 're talking about .
Al Gore : So the Alleance for Protexture of Clima has launched two campaign .
This is a part of them , a part .
Video : Acore : Acore COALergy , we see the climate change as a sery tacks to our business .
So , our priority is to invest a lot of money in a song advertising to make public and confused the truth .
In fact , carbon is not spored .
We think it 's clean -- it 's also a good profugee .
So not preocupatch of change climate change .
Let me do it to us .
Video : Acore : Carbone , you heard a lot of it .
So we do with a turn into a structure to the avange of the puliet .
Straordinary ! The machines are a little rainy , but this is the sound of the clean technology .
The carbon consumption is among the main causes of global warming , but the remarkable technology that you see changes everything .
You look at a look , this is the hodiergy technology .
Al Gore : Indeally , the alternative positive to the economic issue and the national security .
Video : Comment : The economy , the economy , the economy , the national security , climate crisis .
The thing that connects all : our dependence by fossil fuel combustible , like coal and oil imported .
Now , there 's a new , audace solution to use circumboss .
Repower : 100 percent of clean energy in 10 years .
A plan to put America to work , make it more surance , and help to stop the global warming .
And in course , a solution that we do with our problems .
Repower . Scoprice more .
Al Gore : This is the last .
Video : Comment : It 's about to return energy to America .
One of the fastest ways to bring to the dependence of the combustible that killing our planet .
So , it 's the future is here . Vent , a new energy network .
Compars for number two : Negetabsent jobs for jobs .
Comment : Repower America . It 's time to be realists .
Al Gore : An old proverbio , they say , " If you want to go fast , go to fast .
If you want to go away , you go together . "
We have to go away , fast .
Thank you very much .
Last year at TED , fuck to TED , fall .
And promise to return to the way to get you about how the machine works .
So there 's the largest scientific experiment that we had no , the LHC is the largest scientific experiment ever that 's -- 27 miles of circles .
His task to rearing the conditions that were present less than a billion in the universe -- until 600 million times a second .
All of that 's just unambiitious .
This is the machine in the Ginevra .
We have these little Big Bang in the detectors .
This is what I work on . It 's called ATLAS -- is large-half a diameter , and it 's a 22 foot .
This is a spectacular picture of ATLAS building so you can see the proportions .
TTTsettembers of last year , we put the machine for the first time .
And this picture was taken by ATLAS .
It was because of immense festeggams in control .
It 's a picture of the first of particles that had done all the turn of the LHC , entering in collision , with a part of the LHC , and spread particles in the relevator .
In other words , when we see that image 10 writing , we knew that the machine was working , which is a great witory .
I don 't know if it was this to do us more or this , when somebody went to Google and saw the page was this .
What it means we 've had a cultural impact beyond to the scientific impact .
About a week later , there was a problem with the car , had to these blew here -- these blocks .
These bles are 13,000 amping , when the machine works when the machine works .
Now , the technical between you will look at the files and say , " It 's not true . I 'm physical . I 'm physical . "
And they can do it because when they 're very cosit of becoming out of the superconducts .
So , at least 271 degrees , at least 271 degrees , in the space of the stars , these files can bring that current .
In one of the juncles of the magneti magneti in the LHC , there was a defth of fabrication .
So the file , they surity they 're going to read and 13,000 hold the focus suddenly met a electrical resistance .
This was the result .
Now , this is even more impressive if you think that these magneti fish fish more than 20 tons , and that have been moving about 30 centimeters .
They are damaged about 50 magneti .
We had to take them , what we did .
We rested them and upstaged .
They 're now coming back back to all their place underground .
By the end of the LHC is will be again integrate .
We 're going to access it , and we expect to get data or the lude data , and continuing so our adventure to discover what are the morning that are in the morning that universe .
Now , of course , in a way , these accidents return the debate on the value of science and engineering in front of science and engineering in the front . It 's easy to confuture .
I think the fact that it 's so hard , the fact that I think it 's the value of things like LHC .
I 'd like to end with the words of a English scientist , Humphrey , which , I imagine , in defense of inuseful experiments of his pupille , his pupille was Michael Faraday , he said , " Nient is so much dangerous for progress of human mind how much remarkable remarkable to the human mind that are definitely deal with our triumphony , and that 's not in nature . "
Thank you .
I want to start asking you to rethink about when you , you played cow up the morning .
And as you can understand how to reach them and get them , take them and move them , you know , learn to think and solve problems and manipulating and solving these space relationships .
The space reasoning is deeply connected to the way we understand most about the world around us .
So , from the inspired information of our interaction with physical objects , together to my physical objects , and my collaborator Jeevan Kalanithi , I started asking , " And if , when we use a computer , instead of having the cursor as a pollpastrat that moves on a desktop , we could deal with a very wider , we could deal with a desktop , with both hands ,
and how would it to our please ?
The question was so interesting that we decided to explore the answer , building Siftable .
In a few words , a Siftable is a interactive computer interactive .
In a few words , a Siftable is a interactive computer interactive .
You can move with the hand , they can , " see " between them , you know , " and they 're going to hear their motion and a wireless .
But most hadn , they 're physical objects , like the morning , you can just move it to be mistake .
The Siftable is an example of a new ecosystem of tools to manipulate digital information .
And as they become more physical , conscious , conscious of the motion , other , and as they become more physicists , conscious , of how to die them , we can explore new ways , we can explore new and fun of interaction .
I 'm going to start with some simple examples .
This Siftable is configured to show video : if you 're himself in a direction , the video is going to rotable , video , the video is going to round .
These interactive rats are aware of other people .
If I deal with them , they 're interested in what they 're around .
If they 're surrounded , they can see it and they can do a little bit .
If they 're surrounded , they can see it and they can do a little bit .
They also great-tached motion and inclination .
And then I realized that one of the interesting implications of the interaction was able to use common managed to the data , for example , to example , " a color like it was a liquid .
In this case , we have three Siftable configured as a bucks and I can use them to the color in the middle , where they mix .
And I can use them to fix the color in the middle , where they mix .
If we 're too too , we can put a little bit of place .
There are also beautiful possibility of learning , like language , as language , mathematics and games where people can try things fast , and see the results are immediately .
I 'm --
This is a Fibonaccount that I do with a program of equations .
Here we have a words that 's half between Scarabeo and Boble .
Pratically , at every turning you had a letter at the case on every Siftable , Pratically , to every turning to a letter on every Sifable to a letter on every turning in the dictionary .
And then , after about 30 seconds they put together , and you have a new letters of reading and new chance to try .
Thank you .
Here 's the children came to the Media Lab , I did in a way that I tried them and I went to a video .
They are very pleased .
And one of the interesting things that kind of application is that you don 't have to give people a lot of education .
You just say , " Compons of words , and they know exactly what to do .
Here 's what other people trying to do it .
This is our younger tester tester , there 's the right .
It 's actually just wanted to impilt them .
They only were morning , for him .
Now , this is a application of a interactive cardboard .
We wanted to build a tool for the apprentice of language , Lui is Felix .
It can put new characters in the scene , lifting the Siftable them associated .
It can put new characters in the scene , lifting the Siftable them associated .
So , he 's doing out the sun .
Video : The sun is smile .
David Merrill : Now , she took a treat the scene .
Video : The treat at the time .
Bel work ! Yeah !
So , by eight and put up with Siftable and put them close to the characters --
Video : Bau !
-- by inventing your story .
Video : Hi !
DM : It 's a story with the final open , and it can decide him like it 's going to be a lot of fly .
DM : It 's a story with the final open , and it can decide him like it 's going to be a lot of fly .
Video : From , that all .
DM : The last example I have time to show you is a tool , made of a tool , to sample and execececececececectful music .
It 's a tool , made of recent , to the campioneed and execececutilization .
The Siftable here are souncing like the bass , based on the ground and the battery .
Every one of these has four different variations , and you can choose which to use .
You can also put these sound in a sequence that you can comporing your please .
And then , just by making a sequence sound and a sequence .
These are actually , you can control from the vial , like reverber and filterm .
You take it to a particular sound and then fires to fix it .
And then there are the general effects as time and volume , which they apply to the sequence .
We look at how it works .
Video : We 're going to start putting a basin two Siftable Redwood , we put it in a series , we add the other base .
Now I put a land-bottom line .
Video : DM : Now I add percussions --
Video : I 'm now going to put the filter to bacteria , so I can control the effect from the alive .
Video : DM : I can fast the entire sequence of the way to sequence the whole time on the other .
Video : I 'm going to add the film to the bottom to the top expression .
Video : DM : I can recombine the sequence to flight .
So I don 't have to plan it before , but I can suddenly make it , make it longer or the shapes .
And now , finally , I can spend the whole sequence on the left Siftable to the By BBBBBB" volume " volume " . "
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is to build new mo-silver machine , and more soembles how our brain work and body .
And today , I 've had time to show you one of the results of this path , and also some chance we try to bring out from the lab .
The concept I want to transport you is that 's coming to this new generation of design objects to interact with digital media , which will take to the digital information in the way we want .
Thank you very much .
I don 't see the time to talk with all of you .
I 'm a writer .
And I 'm going to crude books is my profession , but it 's more than this , of course .
It 's also love and the fashion of my life .
And I don 't expect that it can change .
But , said , something particular has been successful in my life and my career , which has brought me to recalibrate the entire relationship with this work .
The particular thing is that I recently written this book , this wherever called " Mangia , Prega , " Ama , " which , diversly from my previous books , for some reason came out in the world and became a great , and it became a great , the international , and the interational features .
And the result is that everywhere to be now , people treat me as if I were conconconconconvicted .
It 's true -- it 's conconconconconconconconconconconconvicted .
They 're all worried to me and they say , " You don 't fear to do it better ?
Don 't you fear to keep writing for all life without being able to create a book that can be able to create a book that can be important to somebody ? "
What can we care about somebody ? "
It 's unsurance , you know .
But it may go worse , part of the one I remember that over 20 years ago , when I started saying to people -- I was a adolescent -- I wanted to be a writer .
I would enjoy the same reaction that was based on the fear .
And people said , " Don 't I couldn 't have success to be successful ?
Don 't you fear that the humiliation of the refit .
Don 't you fear to do this window for all life without anything out there , and to die on a cue of dreams with the mouth of dreams with the bits of bear to lose the ball of failing to lead to the failing to lead to hold the board of lower . "
So , you know .
The answer -- the short answer to all these questions is , " Yeah . "
Yeah , I 'm fear of all those things .
I 've always had fear .
And I also have fear of other things that people can 't guess .
As the algae and other spent things .
But , as I would write what I thought and I asked the last last multiply is why ?
Is it rational ?
It 's logical that anybody who have to wait to be spended by a job that you 've been born to do .
But what is so specifically in the impression and make us nervous health care about mental health care .
How my father , for example , he was a chemist engineer and not remember about one time in his 40 years of activity that he was asked if he was asked if he was fear to be engineer ?
There was never -- that blogging to engineer John , how do it ?
It didn 't work that , you know ?
Onestly , chemicals like group have not certainly , in the centuries , guadly , the reputation of depressive being alcothy maniaces .
We have a writers , we have enough this reputation , and not only writers , but creativity of all kinds of instable to be huge unstable .
And it 's not anything else that you look at the trial deaths of the magnificments that , only in the 21st century , they die young , they die young people are often died young and often .
And the ones that you don 't have to be sucked by their dunes .
Norman Mailer , before he died , in the last interview , he said , " Every book , " Every little more , a hermation about the work of their life .
But we don 't beat when we hear that because we 've heard these things so long that we 've heard these things so long that are interiorized and accepted the notion that creativity and suffering the notion that creativity and suffering are in some way to read and that art .
And the question I want to take all of all today is : are you agreed with this idea ?
And it 's OK , because it 's looking at it from a centimeter to me not well well , this support for anything support .
I think it 's hatred .
And I think it 's also dangerous and I don 't want to see the perpetuate in the next century .
I think it 's better to encourage our creative minds .
And I certainly know that , in my case -- in my situation -- it would be very dangerous to start fold the circumstances that are in my career .
It 's very , very much of the things are rather young , I 'm a lot of young , I have about 40 years .
I 've got about four worldwide work in me .
And it 's very likely that anything I 'm going to do now is going to be judged by the world like the work that came out after the spending success of my last book .
I 'm going to slavery , because we are all more or less friends here -- is I likely my great success is my shoulder .
Oh , Gesus , who thought !
You know this is the kind of thinking that leads a person to start to drink a nine in the morning and I don 't want to do it .
I would continue to do this work that I love .
So , the question gets , how ?
And so it seems to me , after many reflection , which the way to work to continue to write is to create a psychological construction , OK ?
I have to find some way to find a distance of security between me , which I 'm writing , and my natural anxime that will do , and I was trying to do it , and I was trying to do it in the time , trying to see if they could have some better ideas and look at the time , trying to find other society to see if they could have better ideas and more healthy and sane societies that are more than to make it . And , I was going to try to see if they could have some of the best ideas ,
how to help people with creative people to run the inerent risks emotional risks of creativity .
And that research has taken me to the ancient Grek and ancient Rome .
Seguitem because I 'm giving in the circle and then go back .
In the ancient Grek and ancient Rome -- people didn 't seem to believe that creativity came from men , OK ?
And it was thinking that creativity was this spirit looking at and they come to the men from a few distant source and unknown , for distant distant and unknown , for reasons .
The Great great-spiriters of the demonons of creativity .
Socrate , wonderful , wonderful , he believed to have a wisdom that could be wisdom to get away .
The Roomes were the same idea , but they called that kind of spirit without a genius .
Which is great , because Roands didn 't really think that a genius was somebody who was particularly intelligent .
They believe that a genius was this kind of divine that was believed in the walls of an artist study of a kind of artist , a little bit like the elpho Dobby , and that came out to the work of the work of the artist and models the result of that work .
Here 's the distance of -- here 's the distance of which I talk about -- that 's psychological construction that you protected the results of your work .
And everybody knew that was how it worked , right ?
So the anti-artists were protected to certain things , like , for example , too much narcism , no ?
If your work was exceptional , you couldn 't take the whole whole deserve , everybody knew that you 've been helped by this incorporate genius .
If your work failing work , it was not all your failt , right ?
Everybody knew that was your genius to be a incapable .
And so people han conceived creativity in the West for a long time .
And then the Rensis came and everything changed , and it 's changed this great idea ; we put the human being in the center of the universe over all the way and the mysteries and without leave space to creatures .
This was the rational principle of humans and people begin to think that creativity came from completely from the hydwide .
And for the first time in the history , they began to refert to this or artist as a genius as a genius rather than a person with genius .
And I have to tell you , I think it was a big mistake .
I think I allow somebody , a simple person to believe that being like a recipient as a recipient as a recipient , creativity and all smisters , creativity , inknowable and ethern it is a responsibility .
It 's like to ask somebody to enjoy the sun .
It deform and destroying the ego and creates all these inexhibition on performance .
And I think it 's been this pressure to have destroyed the artists in the passed 500 years .
And , if this is true , and I think it 's , the question becomes , and now ?
Can we do that ?
Maybe I can go back to a more ancient understanding of human relationship and mystery creative mystery .
Or maybe not .
Maybe we can 't cell 500 years of rational thinking in a disorse of 18 minutes .
And there 's probably people in the audience that would have to be legitimate scientific , in the notion , they do that they follow the next people to their projects .
And it 's probably not really convince you all about this thing .
But the question I 'd like to ask is -- why not ?
Why don 't I think about this way ?
because it 's more sense of everything that I 've ever heard to explain the exasperant imprevealbility of the creative process .
One process that , as anyone who ever attempt to do something -- so , basically , all here -- you know , you 're not compored .
And , in fact , it can sometimes be completely paranormal .
I did this meeting recently with the extraordinary poetry Ruth Stone , who has now 90 years , but he was a poetry for all life and told me that during her infants in the rural Virginia , working out in the camps , and he felt it , in if you , when a poem was a poem .
She said it was like a frageous air tracks .
And that was rotating to her from the landscape .
He felt that , because he had to tremare on the ground under his feet .
He knew I had one thing to do at that point and was , by words , " running like a math . "
And so he would reach home and she was sitting from this poem , and it would not have to get a piece of paper and a math enough , and a math enough enough , when the trapse , while the trapart , and they were mistake on the page .
And sometimes he couldn 't be fast enough , so he would run and he would correct and he would run up and he would run it to the house and the poem , and he would continue to rotolate through the landscape , looking for , as she said , " another poet . "
And then there were those times -- this piece of never forget it -- there were moments in which it was almost losing , OK ?
So , he was running home and he was trying to the card and the poem was going through , and he was doing a math in the way that he was passing , and then he was like , and then he was like , and then he was going to go and the cool .
And he was a poem from the coda and remain his body and transcent it into its body and transcent on the page .
And in these cases , the poem would be presented on the perfect page and intact , as the last word at the first .
So when I heard it -- it 's crazy , it 's exactly the same same as my creative process .
Not all my creative process -- I 'm not a conconconconconstruction .
I 'm a mulo , and my way to work is ; you know , you know , you know , I 'm going to go up and go down and work on the bottom .
But even I , in my testing aggin , I 've strippped that thing , sometimes .
And I guess that many of you the han made .
You know , even though the work and the ideas came to me from a certain source , you can 't walk up honestly , I could know .
And what is this thing ?
And how can we relate it to us to not do it , but rather , what about it , rather , that , to make us remain healthy ?
As I 'm about , the best contemporary examples that I have is the musician Tom Waits , which I 've interviewed different years ago for a newspaper .
We were talking about this , and you know , Tom , for the majority of life has been the incarnation of the artist tomented contemporary inch , trying to control , to control , dominate these species of impulses .
But then he inveces , he calculated , and he was driving on a highway in Los Angeles , he changed all for him .
He was going to fast , and all of a training that little bit of melody , which comes in his head as a inspiration , and it 's a very exceptant , and the wants , you know , it 's wonderful , and the desider , but it 's not about how to take it .
It 's not a piece of paper , it doesn 't have a math , it 's not a register .
So he starts to hear this kind of old old anxioning up in him , " I 'm going to lose , and I 'm going to remarried , and I 'm going to remain .
I 'm not good enough and I can 't do it . "
And instead of going to go to the panic ,
And he 's the whole mental process and made something completely new .
He just just watching the sky and he said , " Scause , I 'm driving ? "
" You know , it looks like a song now ? "
If you really want to extra , you go back to a moment when I can take care of you .
And then , you go to importess some other today .
You know , you know , Leonard Cohen . "
And his process changed after that .
Not the work , the work was still dark as a time .
But the process , and the fish that was released when he was released when he was releft to the genius , the genius that was caused for it and fressed it back to where the problem was , realized that it was not to be a interized thing and remain .
but you know this peculiar , wonderful bizarre collaboration between Tom and this strange and outside that was not Tom and that external thing that was not Tom .
So , how I felt that story , so I was working to change a little bit even the way I worked and I was always save me .
This idea , I 'm going to save me when I was writing " Mangia , " Ama , " and fall in one of those cave the disperation that we all do when we 're working on something and we can 't start thinking about it , and you start thinking that it will be a disaster , which is the worst book I 've write .
Not only bad , right , the worst book written .
And I started thinking about thin this project .
But then I remembered Tom who talked to the air and I tried .
So I went up my face on the dark and I was commented my commenter a vacuum of the room .
And I said , " Sestus , what , you 're going to , you both know if this book is not going to be bright , no , it 's not going to be bright ?
Because as I 'm putting everything I have , I don 't have this one .
So if you want it to be better , you have to present you and do your side .
OK . But if you don 't do it , you know what , I don 't do it .
I 'm going to write the same because it 's my work .
And I 'd like to do that was recorded I 've presented today to do my part of " because -- finally it 's so , OK -- it 's so , OK -- -- it 's in the end of the double people to the dance of the money of the moon , dance and music that went on and go to the stuff and to the stuff up to the stuff .
And they were always magnifically , because the ballers were professional and they were great .
But every time , rarely , something happened , and one of these artists became transcendent .
And I know you know what I 'm talking about , because you all of you , a performance so .
It was like the time , and the dancer walked through a kind of lander , and it was not doing anything else from the solite , like 1,000 night , like 1,000 night , but all it was all all about .
And suddenly not appeared as a human .
But he 's accese from the divinity of divinity .
And when this happened , they were , people knew what was called it .
They had their hands and starting to start to sing , " Allah , Allah , God , God , " God , God , " God , God , "
That 's God , you know .
And he was a historic note -- when the Mori invaded the south of Spain , I was this abitude with them and the docccclumbs , Allah , Allah , " in the " Allah , " in the " Ole , " , " which you can still hear in the corries or in the flamp .
In Spain , when a artist did something impossible and magic , " Allah , the , the , the By , the , the Bable , , the great , blindness , there -- a last of God .
And it 's great because we need .
But , the problem comes the day , for the dancer , when you wake up and discover that are the morning , when you wait up and the last last .
It 's just a mortal with a mortal ginock , and maybe it 's never going to get that altitude .
And maybe nobody will you have the name of God , and what so much to do with the rest of his life ?
It 's hard .
This is one of the most pathful recogniliations to make in a creative life .
But maybe it doesn 't have to be so anguess if you can 't believe , mostly , that the most extraordinary aspects of your being being from yourselves .
But it 's just that you 're being data in prested by an inimaginable source of this team you have to go to somebody else when you finished .
And , you know , if we think that it 's all changes .
And so I started thinking about it , and it 's certainly how I thought I was a different time in the work of the book that I 'm going to do , the dangerous , attesissues , attacademic success .
And what I have to continue to tell me when I feel electric .
It 's not just your work .
And then you can talk to you your side , any can be .
If your work is dancing , bat .
If the divine , assurd genius to assigned up a few kinds of wonderful , to leave a few kinds of wonderful , for a moment , you can only do you go to the efforts , then , " Ole ! "
Othertherwise , you do the same dance .
And it 's like you .
I think and I have to teach it .
" Ole ! " to you , " only only for having human love and testing tape and testing tale of you to keep you .
Thank you .
Thank you .
June Cohen : Ole !
And as you know I 've talked about some of these projects on the human genome , what can mean and discovery of new genes .
Now we 're starting a new path : we started digitizing biology and now we start digital code and now starting to a new biology , design and wintececectual and wintecectual and wintececting life .
We always tried to bring great questions .
" What is life ? " It 's something that many biologists have tried to understand bunch of levels .
We tried different approach , reduced it to the minimterms .
We 're digitizing by almost 20 years , we 've ever horse .
When we sequenced the human genome was to spend from the analome of the world in the digital world .
Now we ask us : can we regenerate life , or create new life from this digital universe ?
This is the map of a little organism , Mycoplasma genitalium , which is the species from the smallest genome between those who can authorean .
And we tried to reduce the genome to create a little bit more .
We 're able to eliminate a hundred genes of about 500 that are here .
But when we take a look at at its map , it 's relatively simple than our own .
And believe me , this is simple .
But when we look at all the genes that we can eliminate , one at the time , it 's very unlikely that this can bring a living cells .
So we decided that the only way to prorecreates to be synthesize this chromosoma that way we could get to get some of these fundamental questions .
So we started the adventure of the " Can we can synthesize a chromosome ? "
Can we confeeling to produce these big molecules that we never have been able to create before ?
And , in case , we can we make a chromosome ?
A chromosome is just a piece of chemical material inert material .
The speed with which we 're able to digitize life is growing up to report .
Our ability to write the genetic code , instead , proposing rather slowly , but it 's improving .
And our most recent results the results of the exponential curve .
We started over 15 years ago .
The process has required many passages , starting with a bioethic required before we began to be experiments .
But we found that synthesize DNA is very difficult .
There are tens of thousands of cars in the world that make little segments of DNA , long , long , and it 's a degenerative process : the longer is longer , the most mistakes are .
So we had to develop a new method to assembly these framments and correct the mistakes .
And this was our first attempt , to go from digital genome , in the digital genome of the X 174 .
It 's a little virus that kills bacteria .
We designed the fragments , effectively , we did a DNA molecule , and you 've got a DNA molecule .
The interesting part is when we took this chemical material inert material inert , and we put it in bacteria , bacteria have started reading this genetic code and produring the viral particles .
The viral particles have been released by cells , they 're back and come back and destroyed the Ecccles .
I 've talked about recent with the oil industry and they 're saying that they 're certainly compressed this model .
They have reviewed than you .
We think that 's a situation where the software can really build its same hardware in a biological system .
But we wanted to do things bigger .
We wanted to build the entire chromosoma .
They 're more than 580 miles of genetic code .
So we thought we build it in the cassets of the size of the virus , so that we can change the cassets that are the components of a living cells .
The design is crucial , and if we start with digital information in a computer , these have to be very accurate .
When we sequenced this genome for the first time in 1995 accurate accurate was a mistake for every 10 miles .
We found that , we resequenced it , 30 mistakes . If we had that original sequence never would be able to work .
One part of the process is to design that are 50 letters that are subsign with all the other segments of 50 letters to build subunits to build subunits small subunits working together .
We make unique elements here .
You probably have to read that we 're sitting that we put in the fishing .
Think about this : we have a genetic code on four letters : A , C , G and T.
Three of those letters put together with about 20 friendly , 20 lottaneful , and there 's a specific order to reading every friend .
So we can use genetic code to write words , frases , thoughts .
What we did at the beginning was autographed to do it .
Some have been dollar that it wasn 't poetry .
We designed these segments to just just join them with enzymes .
There are enzymes that repair them and put them on .
And we started assembling with parts , starting with five to seven mixed by seven mixed , unending them to make up the segments of 24 mile , 24 mile and they were units to get 72 mile .
Everybody step , we produced these segments in abundance so that we 're trying to make an extremely robustobustobustobustobustobey-up -- as you 'll see in a minute .
We 're trying to automatize the process .
So , this seems the tabellon of a basket player .
When we get these very long , more than 100 miles , the more than 100 miles , they will not grow much more directly in the E.
You get to the modern of modern tools of molecular biology .
So we 've been considered other mechanisms .
We knew about another mechanism called recombination omologue , which in biology urial , which in biology will be able to repair the DNA to unit .
Here 's an example .
This organism , called Deinococcus radiodurans , it can absorb three million radiation of radiation .
You can see in the upper square as a chromosome as his chromosome .
In 12 -- 24 hours , it 's reassembled as it was before .
There are thousands of organisms that are able to do it .
These organisms can sit completely .
They can live under empty .
They 're absolutely sure that life exists in space , and you feel to find new environments of water .
At the true , NASA showed that this is .
This is a picture of the molecule that we built using these processes , just using these processes , just using the design of segments to insert .
The light-assemble them automatically .
This picture was not taken with a microscope electronic microscope , but with a microscope .
It 's a molecule that we can see it with a microscope .
These are pictures that costs a period of about six seconds .
This is the advertising that we 've made a little time ago .
They 're more than 580,000 letters of genetic code .
It 's the largest molecule of a definite structure ever created by man .
It has a 300 million molecular fight .
If we stay it with a 10 without spaces , we would like 142 , you 'd like to transcend this genetic code .
Now , how do we do it ? How can we activate it ?
Of course , we have a virus is a game that kids .
It 's a little bit more complicated when they use bacteria .
It 's more easy when it comes from cells as our , as it 's just the witeucariariote , and you can just extract the process of cloning .
In the archaea bacteria , the cell cell , but we recently demonstrated that we are able to do a complete transplant that we are able to do a cell complex of another , and to activate it .
We clear a chmosome starting from a microbial species .
The two are different as men from the mice .
We added a few genes more genes that they can decide what to do is to decide what you can do for this chromosome .
And then I 'm flew with the enzymes so that they kill all the proteins .
And when we put it in cells , it 's been stupendownes -- and you will appreciate our graph . The new chromosophisticatoes -- the new chromosophistication .
And we started thinking we couldn 't go beyond , but we tried anymore in the way .
This is one of the major mechanisms of evolution .
We found that a second , and we 've added a second or a third chromosome , added in a second thousand new tracks to that species .
So who thinks about evolution as a gene at the time that it 's not a gene that 's a lot of biology .
They are the enzymes called restrial restrition enzymes that I 'm going to type DNA .
The chromosome that was in the cells that doesn 't have one .
The cell phone , the cell phone that we put it in inserito--shit .
And it expressed , and it recognized the other as exrange , and it 's the masticated material , and we 've just recognized the cell and the new chromosome .
It 's become blue because of the genes we 've put it .
And in a short amount of time , all the characteristics of a species are going to lose , and it turned out to a new species , based on new software that we put in in cells in cells .
All the proteins have changed , the members have changed , and when we read the genetic code , and when we read the genetic code is exactly what we 've transferred .
Now , this may seem alchemy genetic , but altering DNA , we can change the things in a substantial way .
Now , I 've already explained that it 's not about genesis -- but to progress from three million years of evolution , and I said that maybe we 're going to create a new version of the Cambrian explosion that maybe we 're going to create new species on this digital .
Why do that ?
I think it 's pretty obvious when we think about our needs .
We 're going to move from six and a half billion people in the next 40 years .
Just to give an example : I 'm born in 1946 .
There are three people on the planet for each existent in 1946 , in the 1946 .
We 're having problems now to find food , fresh water and pull , medicine and bells for six and a half billion people .
It 's going to be even more hard to do it for nine billion .
We use more than five billion carbon , more than 30 billion barians , more than 30 billion barians .
That means a hundred million baries a day .
When we try to find biological processes , or any kind of process to replace them , it will be a huge challenged .
And we have to keep the whole whole hemision of CO2 , these materials that 's going on in the atmosphere .
And today , thank you to the scientific discoveries in the world , we have a database with about 20 million genes , and I like to think they are designed for the future .
The electronics possible only only a dozen about components , and think about how many different things are coming out .
Our limitations are principles of the biological reality and our imagination .
Now we have techniques , thank you very quickly synthetization , able to create what we call a combinatory genomics .
We 're able to build a big robot that can produce a million chromosomes a day .
Think of processing these 20 million genes different genes to try to optimize the processes to produce eight drugs , new vaccines , we can change , thank you a little more biology , and create more biology now that in the last 20 years of science .
And it 's just a standard selection .
We can choose to survival , chemical production or carbons , production , or fuel production , vaccines .
This is an instantaneous instantaneous instantaneous instantaneous instantaneous instantaneous of the computer .
Well , we don 't really know how they 're going to be .
We know exactly what their genetic code .
Now we 're focusing on the fourth generation .
You 've seen that you who extract ethanol from the grant , it was a bad experiment .
We have a second and third generation that are going to have enough in the sugar to fuel higher value like the eightttan or different kinds of butanol .
But the only way that biology can have a great impact without increasing more than the cost of food and limitarly to transforming CO2 in matter before , so we 're working to design cells , and we 're working to design cells that are going to be able to design cells that can reach , and think we have the first carbon , and we think we have the first carbon , in about 18 months .
The solar light with the CO2 is a metodo-- but in our discoveries in the world , we found different metods .
This is a organism that we 've described in 1996 .
She lives in deep ocean , about 2,500 feet of depth in the ocean temperature in the water temperature .
They make metane from CO2 using hydrogen molecular as source of energy .
We 're trying to understand if we can incanalate the CO2 , which can easily be transported to tramed tubes , converting that CO2 in order to drive this process .
So , to short think we could be able to increase what the question of " which is , " Noi , great-to-up -- we have the worse of replace -- we have the replace to replace the whole chective oil industry .
Excone . If you can 't do that from TED , where you can ?
It would be a main source of energy .
And also , we 're working for using the same metods to create instantanoid vaccines .
You 've seen this year with flu , we 're always going to go back and a dollar in less when it 's about it it 's flight .
I think that you can change fight vaccines in ancient advaccines .
And that 's how the future may start looking at , now , the tree of evolution , accelerating evolution with synthetic bacteria , arches , arches , and finally intip cells .
We are so on the improving people .
Our purpose is to make it very long enough to live long enough to try to do it . Thank you very much .
First of all I 'm going to see , the fastest possible , some fundamental work , the new technology that we 've taken Microsoft in follow a year ago . This is Seadragon .
It 's a environment where you can interact is in the local level that remote with a huge amount of data visual data .
And here we 're seeing a lot of gigabyte digital photos with a kind of zoom , and continuous , for a sandwiding fast , avails like we want to .
And it doesn 't matter how big it is the amount of information that we see , how big these collection of data or images .
Most are digital photographs , but this is a scanning from the Congress of Congress , and reenter the range of 300 megapiel .
It doesn 't make any difference because the only thing that limits prestations of a system like this is the number of pixels on your screen in any time . It 's also a very flexible architecture .
This is a book , an interest , example of data not images .
This is the Casa desolate of Dickens . Every colonna represents a chapter .
And to show you that 's about text and not images , we can do something like that , to actually see that it 's a real representation of the text , not a picture .
It could be a kind of artificial , to read an electronic book .
Not a remarkable .
This is a more realistic example . It 's a number of the number of the Guardian .
Every image is the beginning of a section .
And it gives you the pleasure of reading the real cardly version cardly , which is for a lot of a magazine , which is for a lot of a lot of a half .
We also did something with the corner of the Look in particular of the Look .
We 've created a higher resolutione-- much higher than what you 're using a normal advertising ads -- and we put extra content in the content .
If you want to see the characteristics of this self-mobile , you can see here .
Or other models , or even the specific techniques .
And this really shows some of these ideas to eliminate the limits of space on the screen .
We hope that this means to fire up and other dop-up and other doors , not to be necessary .
Of course , the map is one of the most obvious applications for this kind of technology .
And I don 't want to lose time , if we don 't say we have contribute to give it in this field .
These are all the streets in the United States , and it 's a geospace .
So now we go to something else .
This is actually actually from the vial on the web ; you can go to see it .
It 's a project called Photosynthy , which combine two different technologies .
One is Seadragon and the other is a visual , in the other is a visual computer research that 's a very interesting computer research in the University of Washington , with Steve Seitz of UW Szeliski Szeliski Szeliski Rick Szi Szi Rick . As the re-optime collaboration .
And it 's from the Weadragon Seadragon .
You can see it when we do this kind of screens , where we can go from a picture to the other and have this kind of experience , and have this kind of experience , and have this kind of experience .
But the space collocation of the images here has actually a meaning .
The algorithms of visualization that 's recorded these pictures together , so that they 're all linked to the reverse places that you can ininput them on the rainy rainy . And here you see of the elements of a destable , and these things have been screen . Here you see the elements of a destable and imaging that things have been all lines to the space .
I don 't know if I have time to show you some other environment .
There are a few more space .
I want to go directly to one of the original data of Noah-- and this comes from a previous prototype of Photosynthtotysynthtotysynthomic , which is really the key to the early time time , technology , technology , technology technology technology , and it 's not necessarily , we have a key key key to the world that we put in the website .
We had to worry about legal aspects and so on .
This is a reconstruction of Notre Dame images in Flickr , digit-Notre Dame , Basta digitch , and you get pictures of the kinds of payback , other campus and you can get a picture that 's discovered to this model .
So they are all pictures of Flickr and they all have been linked to space in this way .
And it 's possible to navigate this very simply way .
You know , I never would have thought to end up Microsoft .
It 's very gratificant to get this kind of accovery here .
I think you can see that it 's a lot of different kinds of footocameras : those of cell phone professional SLR , a meaning , a meaning number of meaning , put together in this environment .
And if I can , I try to try and look at those strange .
Many are blocked by faces , etc .
Somewhere , you have a series of photographs -- it 's cole .
This is a poster of Notre Dame recorded correctly .
We can go from the poster to the physics of this environment .
The essential point is that we can do things with social environment . This is now taking data from the internal memory -- from the whole memory of how to apply the land , from the view of how to apply the land , from the view , from the view of the visual view -- and links to all those data together .
All those pictures become linked together , greater than the sum of the parts .
You have a model of the land that emerging .
Think about this as a prolungation of Stephen Lawler on Earth .
It 's something that grows in complexity as people use it , and which people are using it , and which you advantages to use it .
Their pictures are husbed with inserites other people .
If somebody comes the idea of contrassigning all these sundanging , my picture of the cattedrags , suddenly , I can get all of all those data , and I can use it as a point of enjoy in that room , and I can use it as a picture of a little bit of a picture of a kind of cross-to-tool , using the picture of a red kind of cross-to-to-out experience .
Of course , a consequence of all of that are virtual models , which is very interesting models of every part of the land , collected , and that 's satellite images , and from satellar images and similar pictures and similar pictures and similar pictures and similar pictures .
Thank you very much .
CA : I understand what your software is that you have to do it is that you have to do is that at a certain point , in the next years , all the time , all of these , all the photographs and share they connected to the whole world are so linked together ?
BAB : Yeah . What he 's doing is doing it .
It 's creating hyperlink , if you want , you to , you know , you know , you know ,
And it 's doing it in the containing of images .
The thing is becomes very interesting if you think about wealth of semanties that many of these pictures .
As you do a picture of the web , you type a phrase and the text on the text on the web page has a lot of information about pictures .
Now , what if that picture is you connect all your pictures ?
So the amount of interconnection and the amount of wealth and the amount of wealth that is really huge . It 's a classic effect of the network .
CA : Blaise , it 's really incredible . Compliments .
BAS : Thank you very much .
One of the most main pleasure when you travel and one of the delities of ethnographics is that we can live in the wind traditions , whose inever you have the past in the wind , you 're in the wind , you 're in the wind , levigonto the leverage , he 's lead to the leverage .
Bastes thinking that the monthor Jaguar travel still beyond the Milky Via , or that the monitites Inuit are still himalone of meaning , or that in Himalayas , the budddists still , the respire of the Cural anthropology , and that the idea that the world we live in sense , but it 's just a model of reality , but it 's just a model of reality ,
the consequence of a particular adaptations of adaptations that our estrpe has done , well , many generations ago .
And , of course , we all share of essential tracts .
Everybody is hidden . We all procreates .
We are subjects to start .
We have to deal with the inexorability of death , so we don 't surprising and we 're going to be smilk and whom we 're going to be smarks and white --
We all have a art .
What it does is the particular rhythm of the song , the rhythm of every culture .
It doesn 't matter that are the Penan forests of the rainforests , or the following Vodoo 's driving Kenya , or the Curander 's Curander in Kenya , or a camp in the Curander of the Curander .
And he was my journey of travel in the desert a month ago , or a alevaluates yak in the world 's values .
All of these populations teaches us that are other ways of exists , other ways of thinking , other ways of moving in the world .
And if you think that 's a concept that it 's a concept that it can give you hope .
And together , together , the myriades of the world create a ragnote of spiritual life and cultural , which is important to the planet and it 's important to the well-being of the planet as a biological ragnote as biosphere .
And you can think about this remarkable , as a nail , and you can call the nail the exhibition of all concepts , dreams , and inspiration , ideas , inspirations , intuitions , intuitions , inspiration , and intuitions , intuitions ,
The nine is the fantastic patriage of humanity .
It 's the symbbol of what we are and what we can be as as inququisitive .
And because the biosphere was gravly consumed as as as it has been so much faster .
None biologist , for example , that 's about 50 percent of all species has been or is on the orders of the extinction simply because it 's fake , or the most apocaly-hoittics -- in the field of biological diversity -- that 's the most optimistic issues of cultural diversity .
The index of that is , of course , the language loss .
When you 're born 6,000 languages on this planet .
So , a language is not only compost by a vocabulary or a series of rules .
One language is the human spirit of the human spirit .
It 's the half of the animal that the animal of every culture is in the material world .
Every language is a forest , a backin , a backin , a thought , a ecosystem possibility .
And of those 6,000 languages , as we are here in World , at least , at least half the half of the children are horecches in the ears of children .
They 're not teaching children , which means , unless you cambits , unless that 's not about something that are already death .
What 's more sad than being aved by the silence , of being the last to talk to a language , the way to talk a language , of the wisdom of the wisdom of you to anticipate the promise of children ?
This is horring is the state of somebody in the world every two weeks : every two weeks a old mur and it brings with her in the tomble of the last silver of an ancient language .
And I know somebody who 's going to say , " isn 't it better ?
The world would not be a better place if we talk about all the same language ? " Benissim , then we talk to all yoruba . Let 's talk chanese .
We talk about kogi .
You 're a suck of a tract thing that can 't talk about your language .
I 'd like to do a journey through the thnosphere --
a little travel in the etnosphere to give you a gift of what we 're losing .
Most of us forget that when I say , " different ways of exists , " I mean , " I mean , " different ways of exists . "
We take for example this Barasana Barasana , in Amazon Amazon , the popular of anaconda , creates the myth to come from the river of the west in the west sandwers .
It 's a popular people who are not able to distinguish color from the green because you were identified in the forest , which depends the popular .
They have a strange language and a rule , and a matrimonial , called " exogamia " -- you have to marriage a different language .
And all that roots in the past mitological past , but the particularly is that in these families , in these families that are talking about six or seven languages because of marriages of marriages .
They 're limited to listen and then they start talking about it .
We take one of the most interesting tribes I 've lived , the Waorani of Ecuador nural , an incredible popular people that had the first contacts in 1958 .
In 1957 five missionaries have tried a construction construction .
They did taken out the photographs that they thought they had to go into a lot of retails , forest that 's population , forest that 's population of pluvial forest .
They 've gained the photos , they went to the research , and they 're looking at the research , and not finding anything , they 've concluded that it was the hell , and they killed the five missioners with the lights .
But the Waorans don 't only have to kill the strange .
They kill they kill in their own .
54 percent of the mortality was caused by their same .
We have been up eight generations and we found two cases of natural morath , and when we insisted to know , they loaded a lot of them was aging , so he died up , and then they were killed it the same .
The hunters were able to recognize the animal urine .
In the early ' 80s , I 've been assigned a very interesting task when my professor of Harvard , if I wanted to go to Haiti to sweat the base of the potency of Duvalier and Tonton Macoutes , and impossessons of the fast Acts , and impossesses of the veillnesses , and put my fast bonds .
To give a sense of miraculous , I would have to understand Vodoo culture , and the Vodoo is not magic .
It 's pretty much about a complex metaphysics of the world .
Very interesting .
If I asked you to tell you the great religions of the world , what would you say ?
Cristianity , Islam , Buddismo , Ebraism , Ebraism , etc .
A continent is always left out , thinking that sub-Saharan Africa has no religious feeding . And instead of yes and the Vodoo is not the other that the distilt of these religious concepts in the tragic concepts of source .
What makes an interesting report is the intended between life and death .
So , the alive they 're hiding the spirits .
The spirits can invoced by the Great the Great Acqua , they respond to the rhythm , and they replace temporary to the vive soul of the way that for a short moment that 's the following becoming the following .
So , the voodooists love to say , " You white white you go to church to talk about God .
We say in the days and we become God . "
And from the moment you 're married , is the spirit that you , how can you do it ?
So you have incredible events , they follow voodoo in the state of trance , which touches are impuntizing , which touches are unlike when it 's catalyzed in a state of extreme in a state of extreme ,
And all the populations I lived the most extraordinary Kogi of Sierra Naves Santa Marta Marta , in the Santa Marta , in the Santa Marta .
Design civilization that once they lived on the charges that once they lived on the Colombia in the conquatist , the popular people in the conquerte , the popular massive , which is the people on the charge of the charge of charge .
In a continent macked blood , this popular has never been conquisted by the dades .
But now they are governed by a clero , but their formation is very extraordinary .
The young people following are being taken by families to three or four years , and they live in a world that 's made of good and shots in a world that 's made of the ice for 18 years .
Two douly nine years choices to reproduce the nine months of the gesture that spend in the users of the mother , are metaphorically in the ushorically , they 're metaphorically in the Great Mother .
For all this time , they 're acculturate to their society , values that predict their prayers that prey their prayers , and only their prayer , or to say the conversation -- or better , to say the balance .
At term of this incredible initiation , they 're suddenly landed out and for the first time in their life , at 18 years , they see a dawn . And in that active consciousness of the first block , when the sun sun is the value of the beautiful landscape , all that you 've learned in theory . The first one of his spendor .
" I 'm ? Proprise how I said .
It 's wonderful . Now , you 're going to protect it . "
They call greater brothers and they say that we , the minor brothers , we are the collide of the destruction of the world .
This level of intuition is extremely important .
When we think about ingene populations and the environment invitation Rousseau and the old history of noble noble , which is a razer concept in his simplicity or maybe we 're even even even invoice that these people are closest to the Earth .
The Ingenes are not feeling .
There 's no space for these things in the paludi or in the winds of the Tibet , but thank you for the time and the ran , they 've created a mystics of the Earth that 's not about neighborhood to be neighbors , but on a more sot-to-boundaries .
What does it mean ?
And he means that a little girl of Ande who grow up the mountain is a spirit Apu that will leave his destiny will be a human being destroy different , and it will have a human being deeply different relationship with the mountain that place to a little bit of Montana who grow up a boy of rock that is a friend of the mountain .
That 's the dimad-one waste or a mineral cutteral is irrelevant .
What 's interesting is the metaphor that defines the relationship between the individual and the natural world .
I grew up in the forests of British Columbia believing that forests would forests to be cut .
And that made me a human being different from my friends Kwakiutl who believe that the forests are the forests of Hukuk and the bats of the paradise and the behind the wild of the world , we 're in the wild of the world , we 're deal with the Hamatsa .
If you start looking at that these cultures can create different reality , you can start to understand some of them that discoveries . We make this plant plant to understand some of them .
I 've taken this picture to open up in the nordocccandy .
Mayahuash , some of you have heard about the world 's lamanic repertoire of the monthic repertory .
What makes it fascinating the ayahuash is not the potential to make a major potential of the substance , but its elaboration . It 's made of two elements .
On one side , this liana laws that has a series of carboline , harmful , harmful , slightly hath-bunch .
And then , by making the only plant , it 's a fight that altery , but it 's measured with the leaves of a hand-a-hand-a-family househ-called Psychotric .
This plant is a plant powerful pline , very similar to serotonin , dimethyltryptamine-5 , methoxtamine .
If you ever see Yanomami , pulling on the nose that they do with a different set of species , anchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchicken .
Tiring that poor is a little bit like being disappeared by a little bit like being dispointed by a caric cool , and landing on a sea of electricity . [ Rec] not create a destaursion of reality ; it creates the reality .
I was often wild with my professor , Richard Evan Shultes , the man who did the psychedelic fungi , with his discovery of the fungi of the fungi of the fungi of the fallucinogens in the ' 30 in Mexico .
In my tesis , you can 't class these tripppamines like hallucinogens because if you can 't tell anybody to be hallucinated . And the tripamine , they can 't be sat at at all , because they 're denied by a enzyme that 's a enzyme that you can 't be sundase-dear ,
It 's possible to be able to doubled with other chemicals denize the MAOr .
Now , it 's the beautiful : Is that they find in this lianeous , are inhijititems to potentially get the tripptamins . The question smies smies , in a flour of the kind of spontaneous , how they do these popular ards , how these people have to find two deogens . And if you can do that , they make a very good biochemical version that 's sounds that it 's sometimes sometimes sometimes in this way , creating ?
We use the great eupherror , which can reveal inhicked .
But if we ask the Indians , they 'll tell us , " The plants are talking about . "
What does it mean ?
This tribes , the Cofan , has 17 variety of ayahuasks , which distinguess nectively in the forest , and that our eyes would remain the forest .
If we ask them how they 're going to stbike their tassonomics will say , " I thought , " I thought , " I said , " No . "
The solution is : You take the 17 variety of a full of moon and each one will sing with a different downtools .
With this is not in Harvard , but it 's much more interesting than content the stams .
Now , [ applausi ] the problem is that even the ones of us who have to heart popular people find them , they 're standing in the world , and they 're going to the margins of the history of our world , and pass .
In fact , the 19th century , it 's not going to be remembered to his lead or innovations technologies , but rather as the thing that was where we stopped and actively impact the destruction of biological diversity and cultural impact and cultural diversity of the planet . Now the problem is not the change .
All cultures through the centuries that are involved in a dance for new chance of life .
And the problem is not technology .
The Indians Sioux not have stopped to be Sioux when they put up the arc and they receive as they 're stopped by being Americans , when they put up the horse and calculus .
It 's not the change or technology that threatening the integrity of the thnosphere . It 's the power .
The last flight of the domination .
And if you give a look at the world , you 'll find that these are not destinated cultures that these are not destinated cultures .
They are living and dynamics and spint out of existence as existence as existence as well as they adaptation .
I know that you have to disboscation in the patria of Penan --
a popular nomeless , in the Swest Asian , a popular popular that liball of free to a generation ago , and now reduced to the remarkable to the servitoes , and now reduced to the prostitution of the rivers that seems to be a half a way that seems to take it out to the walk up the horizon , where you can see the horizon , where the horizon the horizon , where you ,
With the wood stone of the subtle with the forest .
Or , in the case of Yanomami , are the disease that are the discovery of the golden .
If we move on on the mountain of Tibet , where I 'm doing a lot of research , you 'll see the hard hard flight .
As you 'll know the genocide , the physics of a popular popular , is convictims of a popular life , but the wild , the destruction of a population , not only is constructed , but even to tell you about exchange .
And you can 't understand the suffering of Tibet until it 's part of the time .
I 've been there in the 6,000 miles from Chengdu in Western China through Tibet soriental , coming to Lhasa with a young link , but only came to Lhasa young link , but only came to Lhasa , I realized what I 'm going to hear .
6,000 sacres reduced in dust and cenjoy .
1.2 million people killed by military during the Cultural Revolution .
The dad of this guy was ascriticized at the Panchen Lama .
That means that it 's been killed in the time of the Chinese invasion .
His fall with Santity Santity during the diaspora that has brought the popular in Nepal .
She was sweet and she was styed and his colth was rich .
It 's been brought to the age of two years old , hidden under his gonna because it couldn 't live without him .
The sister , which did the same , was mit in reduced reducation .
One day he had invertitively calculpested a wraffigant Mao and , for this transgression , was mit to seven years .
The Tibet 's pain can be inoveroveroverwhelmed , but the spirit of the popular is kept .
And then , all of the way , it reduces a choice .
We want to live in the world world of the monothic world , or we want to accover the world policy or we want to acacover the world ?
The great anthropologue , before he died that his greatest fear was that , in our going to deal with this view view of the world , we will not only see the whole range of human imagination reduced to a conversation of thinking , but a day we 'll take a conversation of thinking , but a day we 're going to go up from a sleep to a slead sleep on a slead ,
And it 's umillion people to recognize that our species is existed for 60,000 years .
The Neolitic Revolution , who gave us the agriculture , which has done us subcracy to the seed of the shaman with the prostype of the shaman , creating the hierarches of specialization , and we talk about 10,000 years ago .
The modern world industry has 300 years old .
That 's a story that 's not suggests that we have the answers to all the challenges that we 're going to go .
When you get these myrith-rild of cultures , they asked what humans are saying to say , they 're human , they respond with 10,000 different voices .
And it 's in these answers that we all all recover the chance of being what we are : a kind of awarning , which has to do all the people and all the gardens can fire . And there are great moments of optimises .
I 've taken this picture on the northern summary of Baffin the island , when I went to the whales with the Inuit , and this man , Olaya , Olayas , he told me the wonderful story of his grandfather .
The canadese government has not been willing with the Inuit 's popular in the ' 50s to stbilish our supremimic wealthy , we 've required them in colonies .
The grandfather of this man refutterly to go .
The family , I teeping her life , took him all the time , and all of his attices .
You have to know that Inuit don 't temon the cold , they exploit .
The packs were sleds in origin were made of bunch .
The grandfather of this man didn 't make it met from the library , or from the library of suffering .
It 's sweet , you 've cut the pants in the skin in the skin and defecated in your hand . When you did you did it , you 're working on it . When you did it , you 're working with a lower .
He spring up on the dog of this hell of cunk and when it became solid , he killed a dog .
It 's a sleep , and he made a brighter , with the cass toath-to-a-sleep , and he 's disappeared on the banks , hell on the shake , hell on the shapes .
We want to talk about cavarself-income with nothing ? [ Run] And this , in different ways , [ Applausi is the symbol symble of the resilience of the resilience of the world .
In the april 1999 , the California government has reached the total control of an area of the biggest territory of the world 's bigger than California and Texas put together .
It 's their new patria . It 's called Nunut .
It 's an independent territory . They all the time they 're going to all the mineraries .
One splendiddo example of how a natione-state can recognize with his popular .
And , to finish , I think it 's pretty obvious at least at least in these remote song of the planet , realizing that they 're not remote to all remote .
For somebody 's home .
They represent human imagination that are going to go to the dawn of time . And for all of us , the dreams of these children , like the dreams of our children , become part of the wild geography of hope .
From , we of National Geographic , we are convinced that politicians will never get anything .
We believe that the polemies --
[ Applausi is not persuasive , but we believe that the stories can change the world , and maybe we 're the best institution to tell the stories of the world . Every month of our webs have to be 35 million visit .
156 countries spread our television channel .
Our rivers are threading from millions of people .
Our work is traveling in the etnosphere to bring our public places in places that are going to go through how they 've seen and , they 're going to be able to , hold it , they will be able to reveal in the diversity of anthropology : the world of existing in the diversity , and we have to find a lifestyle and multicultural world , and multicultural , multicultural , and multicultural , and multicultural , and we have to find a life in a pluralist and ,
where wisdom of all the people can contributed to our well-being collective well-being collective well-being collective well-being .
Thank you .
I 'm going to talk about some things I wrote in this book I hope I 'm going to try to figure out some connections , in the case not notice it .
I would like to start with what I call " the official doggma official dogen .
The official dogn of what ?
The officer of all the Western industrial society , the Western officer : " The officer 's rewelling our citizens . "
The reason is , from one side , in the fact that freedom is in itself a value , is uable , useful , essential for humans .
On the other is that if we are free , each of us can act to do it for all the way that massimilar our well-being , without no one that you 're going to decide .
The way to massimilar freedom is massimilar the choice .
More choices people have , the more liband are the freedom , the most of the wealth , the greater is their well-being .
This , I think , is so deeply rooted in society that nobody would dream to put it in the doubt .
And it 's also rooted in our lives .
I 'm going to show you some examples of what progress has made possible .
This is my supermarket . It 's not particularly big .
I lose a simple note about condition for unless .
In my supermarket are 175 conditions , without content 10 variety of oil extraverage , and 12 covers , which you can buy to make a huge number of conditions in the incbreaking of conditions that nobody of 175 proning to your degrees .
Here 's how the supermarket .
And then you go to the walk of electronic to buy a stereo : you , plan , plan , piaright , the lower .
And in this single store of electronic wiring , there 's a great number of audididic components .
We can make six million and a half million different combinations using the components that there are only in a store .
You have to admit that 's a lot of choice .
And the world of communications : the world of communications .
Once , when I was a child , you could get all the telephone services , and pat the pitches that were fornitable with Mom Bell .
You had the phone , you didn 't buy it .
One consequence of that , the other one was that the telephone never break .
These days are gone .
We have a variety of the near-wspelling variety , especially between cell phones .
Here 's the cell phone .
My favorite is the one in the middle , MP3 , cut the nose , and forces for the crying brulelt , and foreign for the crying .
If you don 't have seen it in the store under the house , you 're hit , you 're very soon .
And what happens is that people go into the stops and they ask this question . And you know what is the answer ? The answer is , " No . "
It 's not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn 't make it too much .
So , in other aspects of life that are much more important than the acquishes , you know , the same plosion of choices .
Assistence healthcare : no longer in the United States that you go to the doctor and the doctor you have to do .
Instead , you go to the doctor , and the doctor says , " OK , we could do A , or B , " A has these well-to-hold , and these risks . What you want to do ? "
You say , " Doctor , what should I do ? "
And the doctor says , " A has these benefits and these risks , B has these benefits and you have these benefits . "
" What do you want to do ? "
And you say , " Doctor if she was me , what would you do ? "
And the doctor , " But I 'm not . "
The result we call it " mality autonomous , expression that makes it look like a beautiful thing .
But it 's not that a deal , is not that a weight and responsibility to make decisions that something , which is the doctor , to somebody else that doesn 't know anything -- and almost certainly uncertainly it 's maled -- and so not in the condition to make decisions .
There 's a huge marketing of products drug products , direct to people like me and you , that if you think of it 's not a sense , because we can 't buy them .
But if we can 't buy them , why do they public icize ?
The answer is that they want to be able to ask him to ask the doctor to ask him to change the recipes .
What of that as a fundamental is our identity is our identity of choice , as you see in this dream , " We don 't want to force children . " We don 't want to reach more a identity : we have to invent .
And we can reinventing us how many times we do it .
Which means every morning , at the resolution , you have to decide that kind of person you 're going to be .
And it turns out to the family and marriage , a time , a time , unhappy time , it was that you were marriage to anybody , was that you were married the most soon possible , and it was starts to the most soon possible .
The only real choice was with who , not when you know what to do after .
And it 's really about it , it 's really played .
I teach students very smart , and I do their 20 percent less than a time .
And it 's not because they 're not very brilliant , not because they 're less diligent .
but why are I impensierites , I mean , " Would I marries up to be there ? "
" Would I think about my career ? " I have to think before I got to think before or career ? "
They are interrogatives logatives .
And they 're trying to answer these questions , even though it doesn 't complete the compities that I 'm asking and not getting a beautiful vote to my exame .
And they have to do it . They 're important questions .
Now , the work : we are lucky , like Carl underwear , because technology allows us to work every minute , every day , from every day , from every day , from every day Hotel Randolph .
And there 's a corner , and I 'm not saying anyone where , where the WiFi works .
I don 't tell you , because I want to use it .
What does that mean , this incredible freedom of choice that we have to do it ? It 's that we have to continue , continually on , if we have to work or not .
We can go to see our son playing hot , with the cell phone in a pocket , the Blackberry in the other , and the notion , typically , on the ginock .
And even if they are all spent , every minute that we see our son , we 're also asking , " Did you say to the answer this call ? "
" Did I have to answer this email ? "
And even when the answer is " no , " all this makes the experience of your son 's game of your son , very different than what would have been in other conditions .
So , anywhere we look at , little things , big , and big things , materials and styles of life , life is a question of choices .
Once was the world was this : Ovtrue , there were some chance , but it wasn 't a question of choice .
The world of today is a mixed thing : The dilemma is , " Is it a positive thing , or negative ? "
The answer is South .
The positive latest ones we all talk about the negative ones .
And all this choice compories two negative effects on people .
The first , paradoxally , is that produced paralysis that produced paralysis .
With a lot of options between which choose to choose , becomes very difficult to do it .
I offer an example : a conduct study on the flech of flying planning .
A connects had access to the Vanguard data , the giant source society , the giant source society , with about a million clients in 2,000 different companies .
What she found is that for every 10 solutions that are offered in more , the percentage of two percent .
With 50 offer-four-offer-four-percent adhhhanded when they are available .
because with 50 sources between which choose to choose , is sick difficult to decide , and choice is to remain the inner .
And tomorrow , and I ask tomorrow , tomorrow , and of course , tomorrow , and of course , tomorrow never gets .
You know , it doesn 't mean that only these work from old people will keep food for dogs because they don 't have enough money , you want to say that decision is so hostics that decision is so that that they lose the decision is so that they will lose the decision is so that they will lose the decision is so that they will lose the decision is so that that
It 's not participating , they 're losing until five thousand dollars a year from the dator of work , which would be well disposed to be .
So the paralysis is a consequence of having too many choices .
And I think it makes the world like that .
" And finally , to finish ethchup , sensing or maion , sensing or maion ? "
You 'd just take the right decision , if it 's for ethernity , right ?
You don 't want to choose the wrong condition , and you know the wrong condition .
So this is the first effect . The second is that we can avoid paralysis and make a choice , at the end we 're less submitted by the result of how we 're going to be done with less options that choose .
And this for different reasons .
One of these is that with many condition of which choose , if you buy one and it 's not perfect , it 's easy to imagine that you could have a different choice that you could have been better . And what happens is that 's better . And what happens is that the alternative imagination of choice , and the repair the end up of choice , and the repair the respair of choice , and the repair the rest of the rest ,
And when it was a great decision .
More choices are , more easy to any detail than any detail that 's insodation-option of choice .
And also , there 's what economists call expensive opportunity .
Dan Gilbert has very well stamacine as the value that we 're going to depend on what we confronted them .
Of the rest , when there are many options , it 's easy to represent features of alternative arm and be less suit of the option that you have choice .
Here 's an example . I 've been schools with all the ones that are not New York .
But that 's what you 'd probably think .
There 's this copy to Hamptons .
A lussian place of lussian .
It 's faim . Ottime day . It 's all about them .
It 's nothing . But what he thinks is , " Well , maledition , it 's Agotten . "
" All my neighbors in Manhattan are way . "
" I could talk about it right home . "
And it 's going to spend two weeks that 's losing -- every day -- the chance of parking where it wants .
The opportunity decrease the soddisfabrication for what we have , as a cell choice was excellent .
And the most of the options that we have to consider , the features will return us to the expensive to how to cost .
Here 's another example .
This is a lot of things .
It 's about living time , and maybe living in the likelihood .
But the most important thing is that anything you want to choice , you know , you 're not doing other .
The things that we don 't choose to have a lot of attractive attractive what we do .
Third point : spiral growing of expectations .
I tried it on my skin buying a new jeans .
I 'm almost always jeans .
Once the jeans were just like , bought them and beside and besty , they were discomodissies , only after having a bunch , and they were working on a lot of times , starts to go well .
So I went to buy a couple of a new time when the old those old were going , and I said , " I need a couple of jeans , this is my cut . "
The commit said , " Li wants slim , fit , rely fit , axed ? "
Do you want to the cernier or the bottons ? " Stonewashed or " acidlaved " ? "
" Would you want to strate it ? "
" Woth it wants or stretch ? BBBBBBBle bla -- " Continuate to elentax .
I was very sbalord , and after a little bit , I could say , " I want the guy to say , " I want the guy that was , so for a time I tried all of maleditans , and then I went out from the store , I 'm going to get a better jew of the jeans that I had ever had .
It was the massive . With all that choice I had the best choice .
But I felt worse .
Why ? I wrote a whole book to understand it .
The reason I was worse is that with all that choice the whole choice of my expectations were high , jeans had to be perfect .
I was expectations I didn 't expect anything excited about it was about anything that was about 100 different kinds of , but when it was 100 different steps , steps , at least a kind of had to be perfect .
What I had been buy , but not perfect .
After I had a chosen that I was sationally sationally in the confronted .
The adding options in life doesn 't do that increase the expectations that they have respect to the excellence of options .
And this will produring it , even when the results are good .
None in the world of marketing if you realize .
Because if they knew , you wouldn 't know what I 'm talking about .
The truth looks more like this .
" You know , it was better when it was worse . " The reason that was better when it was worse was even even possible to meet surprised as much pleasure .
And the world , in which we live in -- opulent , industry , industry , industry with the expectancy of feedition -- the massive that we can hope is that things that altitude that altitude .
You never have surprised pleasant because your expectations , my expectations , you 're ingiant .
The secret of happiness -- what you 're here -- is , " Baxy wax " Yes , you want . "
I mean , little cartools -- which are really really married and my wife is really wonderful .
I couldn 't do better , I 'm not accounted .
But it 's not always a bad thing .
And finally , a consequence of buy jeans when you have that kind of jeans is that when you 're not satisfacing , and ask you , " Why ? "
" Who responsible ? " , the answer is clear .
The world is the responsible . What could I do you do ?
When there are hundreds of kinds of jeans , and buy a insatisfacing , and ask you who is responsible , is the responsible , is the clear , is the responsible you .
You could have better .
With hundreds of variety of variety available , there are no skeeps for the insuccess .
So when people take decisions , even if you get it , they 're wild , they 're willing and damage the hit to their own .
In the last years , the depression is exploded in the world industry .
I think a factor of meaningful factor -- not the only one , but important -- of this honate honey is that people have a deludents in their own own cluem .
And when they have to explain this situation they think that colve is .
So the final result is that we are better , we 're better , objectively , but we feel worse .
Let me tell you about it .
This is the officer dogma , what we all take for good and it 's completely fake .
There 's no doubt that a little bit of choice is better than I 've got to do it , but it doesn 't make it a lot of choice is better than a little bit .
There 's a critical value , magic . I don 't know what it is .
But I 'm sure we 've been overovercome from a piece of level where choices make our life .
Now , from politician -- I almost finished -- from the politician , the nocction is the following .
What it allows this whole choice in the industrial society is the wealth of material society .
There are many places in the world , and you know , and you know , where the problem is not that they have a choice .
The problem is that they have too pool .
So the factory that I 'm talking about is a malbeing exusive of modern , remarkable society , Western society .
And what it makes it look like and angry is this : Steve Levitt Levitt talked about yesterday of those expensive and discoveries that are unuseful . It 's a sprec sprec .
I mean that these choices , complicated and available , it 's not that they 're unuseful .
I 'm a deletime .
They make us worse .
If a little bit of what in our society , it would allow us to be reversed in those where people have too few possibilities , it 's not just their life to improve but our own life .
This is what economists call a paretian improving .
A redistribution of income redistribution to all -- not only to poor -- because of this choice in excess that we 're going to .
And so to conclude , " Film , you can become all what you want "
You , people of culture , you 'll think , " What does that fish ? "
" It 's obvious that you can 't make anything in a walk . "
" A castrated , a limited view of the world --
And I 've interpret this so , at the beginning .
But then , I think , instead , I realized that fish the end .
Because the reality of the fact is that if you miss the box , so that it 's not not the freedom . You get the paralysis .
If you break the box that all diminds possible diminuminal satifation .
You can take the paralysis , and you reduce the well-being .
Everybody need a sphere .
This is almost certainly too close , maybe even for the fish , and certainly for us .
But the absence of some symbolic sphere is a recipe for infelity and , for the ruin .
Thank you very much of heart .
