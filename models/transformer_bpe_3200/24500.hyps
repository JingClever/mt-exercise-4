I 've shown these slides to show that the slide calculus to show that the glacial calottica , which for almost three million years had the 48 dimensions of 48 United States continental , it 's restretched to 40 percent .
But this subvalue the gravity of the problem because it doesn 't show the spessor of the ice .
The arcccalculation is , in a sense , the clear of the global climate system .
You go up to the winter and you get to extreme .
The next slide will be a quick related carried on the last 25 years .
The ice perennia are signed in red .
As you see , you expand it until the blue scure .
That 's the ice in the winter , which is ritions of summer .
You can see that the cosidry payers , five years or more , is like blood , which is like blood , which is like blood .
In 25 years , it 's been over 25 years from this .
This is a problem because the warming is interests in the land of the ice ice land around the arctic ocean where there are huge amounts of carbon congelated that , and the melted microbes .
I think about the totality of the atmospherent pollution , that would doubled , that amount of of not return .
In some deep laccount in Alaska metane is already rebolling out of water .
The professor Katey Walter in the University of Alaska was taken with a team in a team that was a faster last winter .
Video : Wow ! Al Gore : Wow ! It 's question if we 're going to be .
A reason is that this termal exchange Groenland from the northermorth .
This is a glacial regime .
The landscape had never achivels of it .
This is the Kangerlussuaq , in the southwest of Groenland .
If you want to know how the sea level of the sea for the melting of the ice of the ice of the ice ice ice ice ice .
These rent run wildly .
Another part of the planet : Antarctica , the biggest block of ice on the planet .
The month last month scientists have dichieve that the painting of ice is in negative , and that the Western Antarctica , which pogers on some submarine islands , it 's particularly quickly in the month .
It 's six feet to six feet feet of the bottom , like in Groenland .
Sulla Himalayas , the third biggest block of ice , you see new laghi , which few years ago were glacious .
40 percent of the world population was rushing half of the water that is a melting of the melting .
Sulle Ande : this ice is the founds of the potaste of this city .
The lander has increased .
But when it diminule it , the same happens to the water .
In California , the nenow on Sierra Nevada is diminuity of 40 percent .
The cyrical kins are in crisis .
The predictions , as you have read , are good .
The growing secustoming in the world leads to a remarkable aughter .
The environmental disaster are increasing out of the normal and without precedented .
Four times more numbers over the last 30 years I respect to 75 .
This is a whole windry .
If you look at the context of the historic context , you can see the consequences .
In the last five years , we 've added 70 million tons of CO2 every 24 hours -- 25 million tons in the ocean every day .
Look at the Eastern Pacific area , from the Americas , to the west , and on both parts of the substant continent , where there 's a radical impoverty in the ocean .
The major causes global warming , together to deforestation , which is 20 percent of fossil fuel fuel .
Our oil is a problem , and the carbon is even worse .
The United States is one of the two more emissions , together to China .
And you propose to build a lot of other center in carbon .
But we 're seeing a way of a direction .
These are the anteed projects over the last few years and some green alternative alternative proposes of .
Each a way , there 's a political fight in our country .
CExcles and oil industry have spent 250 million dollars in the last year to promote carbon , which is a oxide .
I was a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a --
Natale Verice , in Tennessee , where I live , there was a 3.8 billion g.
Maybe you have seen it on news .
This is the second bigger flow of last flow in America .
It happened around Natale .
The Reads of one of the carbon industry was this .
Video : Spy the carbon is a very allegro and happy .
It 's abundant here in America , and it grow our economy .
Frosty carbon is more and more and more clean .
It 's good price , adorable and the workers are kept the sticks .
Al Gore : From here 's a lot of the West Virginia .
The biggest mineral society on the mountain is Massey Coal . This is his administrator .
Video : Don Blankenship : I 'm going to have clear -- Al Gore , Harry Reid -- not know what they 're talking about .
Al Gore : So the Alleance for the Clima Protext has two campaign .
This is a part of them , a part .
Video : Acore : Actually , you know , COALergy , as a serious minacting to our business .
So , in our priority is to invest a lot of money in a public and to make public and confused the truth of the fuel .
In fact , the fuel is not sporite .
We think it 's clean -- it 's also a good profugee .
So , not prephipitchemicals .
Let me do it .
Video : CCarbone : Carbone -- you 've heard a lot of them .
So let 's take a turn into a structure at the horrise of a structure to the dry about carbon .
Straordinary ! The machines are a little rumor , but this is the sound of the pulililights .
The fuel consumption is between main main cause of global warming , but the remarkable technology of fuel that you see changing everything .
You look at a look at : this is the odiergn of pulite carbon .
Al Gore : Indeed , the positive alternational security and the national security .
Video : Comment : America is in crime ; the national economy , the national security crisis .
The flip the whole connects to all : our dependence by fossil fuel , like carbon fuel , like carbon oil .
Now , there 's a new , audace solution to use it .
Repower : 100 percent chicked energy in 10 years .
A plan to put America to work , make sure more certainly , and help stop the global warming .
Finally , a solution that basts to solve our problems .
Reforms . You know more .
Al Gore : This is the last one .
Video : How do you get energy to America .
One of the fastest ways to bring dependence to dependence from combustible combustible that killing our planet .
Comparsa : The future is here . I mean , a new energy network .
Novi investment for two : Novi investments for bags .
Comment : Repower America . It 's time to be realists .
Al Gore : A old African proverbio says , " If you want to go fast , you go to the soli .
If you want to go away , you go together . "
We have to go away , faster .
Thank you very much .
LHC : Look at TED , I 've got a introduction on the LHC .
And I promise to ring you about how the machine works .
So here I 'm here here . And for those that other time , there were no , the LHC is the biggest scientific experiment ever attempted -- 27 kilometers of circuit .
His compask is to rereeing the conditions that were at least one billion times a billion times per second .
And this is simply environmental .
This is the machine in Ginevra .
We have photographs these mini-Big Bang inside the relevant .
This is what I work . It 's called ATLATLAS -- it 's about 44 feet and it has a 22 feet behind .
This is a spectacular image of ATLATLAS building , so you can see their own .
Ten september last year , we have accesum the first time .
And this picture was taken by ATLALAS .
It was because of immense to festeggiving in control .
It 's a picture of the first particles that had done all the LHC , entering , entering in collision , with a part of the LHC , and spread particles inside the relevant .
In other words , when we saw that image 10 september , we realized that machine was a great witory .
I don 't know if it was this to exultation more or this , when somebody went to Google and saw that the starts was this .
What it means we have had a cultural impact beyond to the scientific impact .
About a week later , there was a problem with the machine , just to these file files here -- these files here -- these files .
These files are 13,000 amps when the machine works at the massive of power .
Now , technical technical technical between you will look at the files and say , " It 's not true . I 'm fixed too too much . "
And they can do it because when they 're very cosiating cosiating superconstructing superconductors .
So , at least 271 degrees , at least 271 degrees , at least 271 degrees , these files can bring that run that run .
In one of the giuntures of the most novemile magneti magneti in the LHC , there was a defect of fabrication .
So the file file , they were very slightly , and 13,000 himself improvised a electrical resistance .
This was the result .
Now , this is more impressive if you think about 20 tons , if you think about 20 tons , and that have been moved about 30 centimeters .
They are damage about 50 magneti magneti .
We had to take them , what we did .
We rested them and enaged them .
Now they 're going back to all the subground .
By the end of march the LHC will be again integral .
We 'll access it , and we expect it to get data to the right or the lude , and we keep that our adventure to find out what are the morning is that they 're the morning of the universe .
Now , of course , in a certain way , these accidents return the debate on the value of science and engineering of the value of science and engineering in front of science and engineering in front .
I think the fact that the fact that it 's so hard to go beyond the limits , I think is the value of things like LHC .
I want to end with the words of an English scientist , Humphrey , Humphrey , which , I imagine in defense of inuseful , his pupile was Michael Faraday , his pupile was Michael Faraday , said , " Nithing is so dangerous for the human mind of the mind of the mind of science is defining , which our triusters in nature , and that 's not a new ,
Thank you .
I want to start asking you to rethink of when , as children , as you 've played with the morning .
And as you can get them and to do it , and take them and to get them and move them , you know , and you know , you know , and you know , in fact , you know , and in space relationship .
So , the space reasoning is deeply connected to the way we understand a lot of part of the world around us .
So , from inspired information about our interaction with physical objects , together to my physical objects , with my Pactor Jeevan Kalanithi , I started to ask ask me , " And if , when we use a computer , instead of having the only cursor of mouse like pollyer , and we could do , we have the only one of the blood , we could do , we , we would do , we , we could , we could do , we , in a dry information with your hands ,
and how do it to our please ?
The question was so interesting that we decided to explore the answer , building Siftable .
In a few words , a Siftable , is a very big computer as a biscope .
In a few words , a Siftable , is a very big computer as a biscope .
You can move them with your hand , they can see " between them , " and they hear their movement and they have a screen and a wireless .
But most importantly , I 'm physical objects like the morning , as the morning , you can move it to simply afferandle .
The Siftable is an example of a new ecosystem of tools to manipulate digital information .
And as they become more physicists , aware of of the movement , of the other , and as they become more physicists , consciousness of the movement , of how many of the movement , of how we movement them , we can explore new and fun and fun of interaction .
I 'm going to start with some simple example .
This Siftable is configured to show video : if you put it in a direction , the video road , the video will road , and video road .
These interactive rates are aware of of the other .
If you have to hold them , they 're interested in what they 're all about .
If they come around , you see it and they can do it a little bit of it .
If they come around , you see it and they can do it a little bit of it .
They also have their movement and inclination .
We then realized that one of the interests of the interaction was to use communication managed to use communications managed , for example , " a color like it was a liquid .
In this case , we have three Siftable as a great-buck bucks and I can use them to the color in that central , where you mix .
and I can use them to use them to the color in the middle , where you mix .
We 're too much , we can put a little bit of place .
I think there are also beautiful possibility of apprentice , like language , mathematics and logical games where people can try to things fast , and you know , the results immediately .
Now I 'm --
This is a Fibonaccount that I do with a program of equations .
Here we have a words game in the Scareer and Boble .
Pratically , at every turnal you get a letter to every Siftable , Pratically , at every Siftable , Pratically , at every Siftable , and as certain people to compories of them with words , and I look at a dictionary .
Then , after about 30 seconds remix , and you have a new lecket set of reading and new possibilities to try .
Thank you .
Here 's the children came to the Media Lab , I did it so that I triped them and I 've been a video .
They have a lot of them .
And one of the interesting things like this kind of appliance is that you don 't have to give people a lot of education .
You just say , " Compons of words , and they know exactly what to do .
Here 's here to other people try it .
This is our younggstage there to the right .
It was actually wanted to impilling them .
They only are morning in the morning .
Now , this is a appliation of a interactive carddayer .
We wanted to build a tool for the apprentice of the language is Felix .
It can put new characters in the scene , and you know the Siftable them .
It can put new characters in the scene , and you know the Siftable them .
So , here 's doing the sun .
Video : The sun is sun .
David Merrill : Now he took a treat a treater in the scene .
Video : The arange arange .
Bel work ! Yeah !
So , you know , you know , the Siftable and put them neighbors --
Video : Bau !
-- inventing their story .
Video : Hi !
DM : It 's a story with the open , and he can decide how you want to do it .
DM : It 's a story with the open , and he can decide how you want to do it .
Video : From .
DM : The last example I have time to show you is a tool , is a recently realized , to the campioning and executives .
It 's a instrument , which is a recently , to trampioning and to execececutions .
The Siftable here , the Siftable here , based and bacteria .
Each one of these has four different variations , and you can choose that you use .
You can also put these sound in a sequence to compories to your pleasure .
And you 're just doing touch it by doing touch a sound and a sequence . "
These are effects that you can control from the vial , like the reverber and the filter .
It 's attach to a particular sound and then inclens for them .
And then there are general effects as time and volume , and you 're going to applied to the entire sequence .
Let 's look at how it works .
Video : We 're going to start with a basic in two Siftable sequence , we 're going to put it in a series , we add it in a series , we add more .
Now I put a bass line .
Video : Now , I add of percussions --
Video : DM : And I 'll put the bacteria , so I can control the effect from the live .
Video : DM : I can be able to kill the entire sequence of the time by one side .
Video : I 'm going to add the bottom of the bottom to give more expression .
Video : DM : I can recombine the sequence " to flight . "
So I don 't have to planning it before , but I can suddenly make it longer or cord .
And now , finally , I can spend the whole sequence on the left Siftable to the left Siftable .
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is to build new interfaces more and more soembles how our brain work and body .
And today , I 've had time to show you one of the results of this path , and also some chance we try to bring out of the lab .
The concept I want to put you is that 's coming up this new generation of designed objects to interact with digital media , which will bring information in our world in the way we want .
Thank you very much .
I don 't see the time I 'm going to talk to all you .
I 'm a writer .
I 'm going to crude books is my profession , but it 's more than this , of course .
It 's also love and the cine of my life .
And I don 't expect that it can change .
But , said , this is something particularly happened in my life and my career , which has taken me to recently recently in my life and my career with this work .
The particular thing is that I recently written this book , this biography called " Mangia , Prega , Ama , " which , diversly by my precedented books , for some reason why came out in the world and became a great sense , and it was a great interational feelational ,
And the result is that everywhere , people treat me as if I were convicted .
Really -- convicted , convicted .
They 're all about me and they say , " Do you don 't care to do it more ?
Don 't you fear to continue to write for all life without being able to create a book that can important somebody ? "
which can be importantly to somebody ? "
It 's certainly , you know .
But I was going to go worse , part of the one I remember that more than 20 years ago , when I began to say to people -- I was an adolescent .
I was going to go to the same reaction based on the fear .
And people said , " Don 't I temes to me not to do it ?
Did you don 't care that the humiliation of refuse you ?
Do you have to do this window for all life without anything about it is ever there and die on a cumulation of dreams with the mouth of the standard to the check of the lower lead to the moth of failure ? "
So , you know .
The answer to all these questions is , " Yes . "
Yeah , I 'm afraid of all those things .
I 've always had fear .
And I also fear some other things that people may not have to hold .
As the algae and other things .
But , as I was writing what I thought and I was finally , is why ?
Is it rational ?
It 's logical that anybody should expect to be spent by a work that you feel born to do .
But what 's so particularly in the creative companies that are so much about the mental health mental parents in a way that other carriers don 't do ?
How my father , for example , he was a chemist engineer and I don 't remember one time in his 40 years of activity where he was asked if he was doing it was asked if he was fear to be engineer ?
There was never -- that blown to engineer John , how do you go ?
Don 't work that , you know ?
Onestly , chemicals like group don 't have certainly , in the centuries , warmer , warmer , lead the depressive to be alcolized .
We have a writers , we have enough this reputation , and not just writers , but creatives of any kind , we have this reputation of being enormous .
And it 's not about the other than looking at the fits of the magnificments of the magnificments of the creative minute of the 20th century , they die young people , they die young and often .
And the ones that don 't have to be suiciassembly by their dundes .
Norman Mailer , before he died , in the last interview said , " Every my book killed me a little more " an extraordinary affermation about the work of their life .
But we don 't buy it , when we hear this because we 've heard these things so long that in some way , we 've been completely interiorized and accepted the notion that creativity and suffering are somehow tilying and the art , in the end , it will always concerned and the art , it will always be able to the annotion .
And the question I want to ask all of today is : Can you agree with this idea ?
You know this thing -- because it 's also looking at it from a centimeter of distance to me not good at all this supposition .
I think it 's hate .
And I think it 's also dangerous and I don 't want to see the perpetuated in the next century .
I think it 's better encourage our big creative minds .
And I certainly know that , in my case -- in my situation -- it would be very dangerous to start fuse to that wild wild sum the circumstances in which I 'm in my career .
It 's true -- you look at it , are pretty young , I have about 40 years .
I 've got about four work of work in me .
And it 's very likely to write about the time in the world , as the work that came out of the world like the work that came out of my last book .
I 'm going to be slavery , because we 're all more or less friends here -- it 's likely that my big successful is my behind .
Oh , Gesus , who thought !
You know this is the kind of thinking that leads a person to start behing in the nine of the morning and I don 't want to do it .
I would take a little bit of doing this work that we love .
So , the question becomes , how ?
And so I think , after many reflections , which the way to work to keep writing is to create a psychological construction , OK ?
I have to find some way to find a security distance between me , I 'm writing , and my natural anxiety that is going to be able to get back . And I was looking for all last year models , and I was looking through the time , trying to find other society , to try and more sane ideas to see if they could have some better ideas and more sane ideas and more sane ideas and more sane .
how to help people creative manage to manage the creative emotional creative response .
And that research has taken me to the ancient Grek and ancient Rome .
Seguitem because I 'm giving in your eye and then it comes back .
In the ancient Grek and ancient Rome -- people didn 't seem to believe that creativity was from men , OK ?
It was thinking about creativity was this spirit look at the men from a few people distant and unknown , for the distant distant reasons and unknown , for distant reasons and unknown .
The Great 's called these spirites of creativity " demand " demand . "
Socrate , wonderful , believed to have a elarggeity that was a elarggeness from far far away .
Roands were the same idea , but they were called the kind of spirit of a genius .
which is great , because Roands don 't think that a genius was particularly clear .
They believe that a genius was this kind of divine entity that had literally believed in the murity of an artist , a little bit like the elphoto , and that was to be out to see the work of hidden and models the result of the work of the artist of the work of the artist .
Here 's -- here 's the -- here 's the distance of which I 'm talking about -- that psychological construction that you protects you to your work .
And everybody knew that was how it worked , right ?
So , the antic artists were protected by certain things , like , for example , too much , not ?
If your work was exceptional , you couldn 't take it all the deserve , all of you know that you were helped by this incorporease genius .
If your work work failure , it was not all your colm , right ?
Everybody knew that was your genius to be a hinable .
And so people han conceived creativity in Occide for a long time .
And then the Renenagement came and all this big idea ; we can put this big idea ; we can put the human being in the center of the universe over the center of the universe over the universe , and no longer space creatures that writing out of divinity .
This was the rational principle of humans and rational people begins to think creativity came from the ilighting completely from the ilighter .
And for the first time in history , you start to referring this or artist like a genius rather than a person with genius .
And I have to tell you , I think it was a big mistake .
I think I allow somebody , a simple person to believe that you 're like a recipient as a foundation as a foundation , creatives , unknowable and ethern , unknowable and etheran ethes too big to give to the fragile of human beings .
It 's like to ask someone to enjoy the sun .
Deform and demand demand creates all these ingestizable expectations on performance .
And I think it was this pressure to have destroyed the artists in the passed 500 years .
And , if this is true , and I think it 's the question to be , and now ?
Can we do it diversity ?
Maybe come back to a more ancient comprement of of the relationship between human and mystery creative .
Or not .
Maybe we can 't sing 500 years of rational thinking in a death of 18 minutes .
And there 's probably people in the audience would have to read the scientific sospicians on the notion of , you know that people would follow the people spending to their projects .
I 'm not going to tell you all about this thing .
But the question I 'd like to ask is -- why isn 't no ?
Why don 't I think about this way ?
Because it 's more sense of anything that I 've ever heard to explain the exasperant impredicability of the creative process .
A process that , as anybody who ever attempted to do something -- so , basically , all here -- you know , you don 't compories rationally .
And , in fact , it can sometimes seem completely paranormous .
I 've done this meeting recently with the extraordinary poetry Ruth Stone , who has 90 years , but it was a poetry for the whole life and said that during his childhood in the rural Virginner , and he was working out in the camps , and he was out in if a poem , when a poem was a poetry .
He said it was like a frageous train of air .
And that was rotoling to her from the landscape .
He felt it , because he was tremendous to the land under his feet .
He knew I had one thing to do at that point and was , words , " running like a mater . "
And so he 's going to correct home and he was sitting by this poem , and he wouldn 't have to get a piece of paper and a math and a math fast enough , and it was retending it , and to focus it on the page .
Sometimes he couldn 't be enough to be fast enough , so it was so rich and correcrecve and he was not able to get in home and the poetry was to go home and he would continue to rotolate through the landscape , and he would continue to the other poet . "
Then there were those times -- this piece never dementize the piece of -- there were moments where the was almost losing , OK ?
So , he was running home and he was looking for the card and the poetry was looking through , and he was a matita right in the time , and then he said , which was like if you fall the other hand and the coffee .
He was the poetry from the tail and remaining it into its body and transcute into its body and transced it on the page .
And in these cases , the poetry would be presented on the perfect page and intact but the contrast , by the last word to the first .
So when I felt that I thought -- it 's really really really equal to my creative process .
Not all my creative process -- I 'm not convicted .
I 'm a mulo , and my way to work is ; you know me at the same orary every day and I 'm going to play and pass over the gotten office .
But even I , in my headphotos , I 've striped that thing , sometimes .
And I think that many of you have the han done .
You know , even if the work and ideas were to me from a certain source , you can 't waste onestly know .
And what is this thing ?
And how can we relate it to it , so we don 't lose your head , but rather , rather , what do we do we do it in healthy ?
As I think about it , the best contemporary example I have is the Mayer Tom Waits , which I 've interviewed several years ago for a newspspaper .
We were talking about this , and you know , Tom , for the majority of life is the incarnation of the contemporary article , trying to control these species of impulses , dominating these species of impulses .
But then he was invited , and he was driving on a car in Los Angeles , and he was driving on a career in Los Angeles , changed all for him .
He was going to be fast and all of a traacing of this little framment of melodia , which comes in his head as an inspiration , elusive and altitude , and it wants , you know , it 's wonderful , and it 's not know how to take it .
It 's not a piece of paper , he didn 't have a match , he didn 't have a match .
So it starts to hear this kind of old old old old as this guy , " I 'm going to lose , and I 'm going to hit , and I 'm going to lose it .
I 'm not good enough and I can 't do it . "
And instead of going to go to the panic , you stop .
I 'm going to be able to the whole process and he did something completely new .
I 'm going to look at the sky and said , " Scause , I 'm not driving ? "
" To you think it can write a song hour ?
If you really want to exist , you go back in a more opporter when I can take care of you .
Other , you go to importantly qualcut somebody else today .
I went to disturbing Leonard Cohen . "
And his process of working on this .
Not the work , the work was still dark as a always .
But the process , and the fish anxiety that was releft when the genius was releft when the genius was the genius that outside him was a grade and remained it back from where it was doing it back from where it was , and he was doing it back from where it was doing , and it was going to be a interized thing and remaining it .
but it 's a peculiar , wonderful bizarre collaboration between Tom and this strange and outside that was not Tom and this strange and outside that was not Tom .
So , how I felt that story to change a little bit of the way I was working and I was always saved .
This idea , I was saved when I was writing " Mangia , Prega , Ama , and falls in one of those cave the disperation of the disperation that we 're all working on something and we can 't start to think that will be a disaster , which is going to be a disaster , which is the worst book I 've never written .
Not only usually bad , right the worst book .
And I started thinking about giving this project .
But then I remind to Tom I was talking to the air and I tried to it .
So I raised my face on the dark and I was my face and I was my comment and demanding my a vuum of the room .
And I said , " Look , what , you 're both , what , you 're both the way that is not going to be brilliant , no ?
Because as I see I 'm putting all I have , I don 't have this one .
So if you want to be better , you have to show you and do your side .
OK . But if you don 't do it , you know what , I don 't do it .
I 'm going to write the same because it 's my work .
And I want to do my part of the time I 've presented to do my part of " Because -- at the end is so , OK -- centuries , in the Northern Africa people would duned for the dance of the dance of the damage of the dance of the dance of the damage , and to the sound .
And they were always magnify , because the ballerins were professionals and they were fantastic .
But every lot of , rarely , something happened , and one of these artists becomes in reality .
And I know you know what I 'm talking about , because I know you all of you , at a performance .
It was like the time , and the dancing time , and the dancing walked through a kind of landscapes and not doing anything else from the solute , like 1,000 notes before , but all it was alyzed .
And suddenly , not just appears as a human .
But it 's accese from the divinity in the fuoco of divinity .
And when this happened , when this happened , people knew what was , they were called him with his name .
They were conged their hands and began to sing , " Allah , Allah , God , God , " God , " God , " God , "
That 's God , you know .
Wurious note -- when the Morinvaded Spain , I was this abitude with them and pronounce changed in the centuries , I think , Allah , Allah , Allah , " Ole , Allah , " Ole , " which you can still hear in the corries or in the flamp or in the flamp or in the flead .
In Spain , when a artist did something impossible and magical , " Allah , I was , Allah , I was , you know , I was a magnific , good , I mean , it 's a last God .
And it 's great because we need it .
But the problem comes the day after , for the dancing , and the dancing , when you wake up and discovered that are 11 in the morning of Martedday and the last of God .
It 's just a mortal with grade ginock , and maybe it 's never more to get that altitude to get that altitude .
And maybe nobody will you have the name of God still as yourself as yourself as a rest of his life ?
It 's hard .
This is one of the most painful recognizes to do in a creative life .
But it doesn 't have to be so angotten if you can 't believe , mostly , which is more extraordinary aspects of your being from you .
But you might just believe that you 're being data in prested by a inimaginable source of this team that you have to go out to somebody else when you finished .
And , you know , if we think that way all change .
And so I started thinking about it , and it 's certainly how I thought about it for several months during the work of the book that I 'll do soon on , the dangerous , I 've been followed my great successful .
And what I have to keep me when I feel eleventually eleved by this is , not fear .
Not just just giving you . It 's just your work .
You can put it on your side , any of your side , any can be .
If your work work is dancing , bat .
If the divine , I assurd you to give you some of wonderful wonderful , for a few kinds of wonderful , for a moment through your efforts , then " Ole ! "
You have to be , you do the same dance .
And " Ole ! " You know the same .
I think , and I think , you have to teach it .
" Ole ! " to you yourself , even for a human friendly and testing tackets that are crubbing .
Thank you .
Thank you .
June Cohen : Ole !
As I 've already talked about some of these projects on the human genome , what it can mean and discovery of new new set of genes .
Now we 're starting a new persumanent , we started to digitize biology and now we 're both going into a new phase of biology , and now designing and synthizyeling life .
We 've always tried to ask a great questions .
" What is life ? " It 's something that many biologists have tried to understand the warise of levels .
We 've tried different approaches , reduced it to the minims .
We 're digitizens by almost 20 years .
When we sequenced the human genome was treated to spend from the analome of the digital world of the digital world .
Now , we can regenerate life , or create new life from this digital universe ?
This is the map of a little organism , Mycoplasma genitalium , which is the species from the smallest genome between those who can authorem authorean .
And we tried to reduce the genome to create a little bit smaller .
We can be able to eliminate a hundred genes of about 500 .
But when we look at his metabolic map , it 's relatively simple than our .
I think , this is simple .
But when we look at all the genes that we can eliminate , one at the time , it 's very improbable that this can bring to a living cells .
So we decided that the only way to progree to be synthize this chromosoma in a way that could modify the components to bring some of these fundamental questions .
And so we started the adventure of " Can . " Can we synthize a crumosoma ? "
Can you get the chemistry to make these big molecules that we never have been able to create before ?
And , in case , we can do it work a chromosoma ?
A chromosoma is simply a piece of inert material inert .
The speed with which we are digitizing to life is growing up to exponential .
Our capacity to write the genetic code , instead of procreating , rather slowly , but it 's improving .
And our most recent results the bring to a exponential curve .
We started more than 15 years ago .
The process requires a lot of passages , starting with a bioethical requires that we began to the first experiment .
But we found that synthesize DNA is very hard .
There are tens of thousands of cars in the world that produce little segments of DNA , over the long age of 30 to 50 letters and it 's a degenerative process : the longer longer is there .
So we had to develop a new method to assemble these framments and correct the error .
And this was our first attempt to go from the digital genome of Phi genome is 174 .
It 's a little virus that kills bacteria .
We designed the fragments , effectured the correction of error and get a molecule of DNA to about 5,000 lettes .
The interesting part is when we 've taken this piece of chemical material inert and we put it in the bacteria , the bacteria have started reading this genetic code and to viral particles .
The viral particles have been released by cells , they went back and they destroyed the Ecles .
I 've talked to recent with members of the oil industry and they 're certainly compressed this model .
They have recognize .
We believe that this is a situation where software can actually build his same hardware in a biological system .
But we wanted to do things in big .
We wanted to build the entire chromosoma .
They 're more 580 miles of genetic code .
So we thought of building it in the cassette size , so we can change the cassette to understand what are the components of a living cells .
The design is crucial , and if we start with digital information in a computer , these have to be very accurate .
When we sequenced this genome was the first time in 1995 accurate standareas was a mistake for every 10 mile lower .
We found out , 30 error . If we had that original sequence that original sequence we would never be able to do it work .
A part of the process is designing 50 lettes that are highly underlying with all the other segments of 50 letters to build subunit smaller that 's subunit that they 're going to do with them .
We try to be elaborate elements here .
You probably have read that we 're going to read that we 're going to put it on the side .
Think of this : we have a genetic code based on four letters : A , G and TG and T.
Three of those letters put together with about 20 adminioacts , and there 's a specific order to read for every lominods of reading to every lominods .
So we can use genetic code to write words , frases , thinking .
What we did at the beginning was self-do it .
Some have been delusers from the fact that it wasn 't poetry .
We designed these segments to just just just just just joined them with enzymes .
There are some of them to get them and put them .
And we started assembling with the parts , starting with segments from five to seven milecture , unending up in a way to make segments of 24 thousands and and announced it .
Each each step , we 've produced these segments in abundance so that we 're trying to create an extremely robustoking -- as you 'll see in a minute .
We 're trying to automatize the process .
So this is the tabellon a basket playground .
When we get these very long careful segments , more than 100 miles , they will not grow more directly in E.
It 's coming to the modern of the modern tools of molecular biology .
So we 've been considered other mechanisms .
We knew about another mechanism called the omologue , which in biology is to repair the DNA to repair the check to unite the segment .
Here 's an example .
This organism , called Deinococcus radiodurans , it can absorb three million radiation of radiation .
You can see in the upper square like his chromosoma is destroyed .
In 12 -- 24 hours , it 's reassemble as it was before .
There are thousands of organisms that are able to do it .
These organisms can sit completely .
They can live under empty .
They are absolutely , the life existing in space , and you feel places to find new water riches .
ASA shown the NASA shown that this is .
This is a picture of molecule that we built by using these processes , simply using the design of the segment of the segment of the segment that we 've built up with a segment of the molecule that we 've built out of the segment of the molecule that we 've built by using these processes , just using the likely , using
The lights assemble them automatically .
This is not taken up with a microscope that was a microscope , but with a microscope .
It 's a molecule so big we can see it with a microscope .
These are pictures that are doing a period of about six seconds .
This is the advertising that we 've done a little time ago .
They 're more than 580,000 letters of genetic code .
It 's the biggest molecule of a defined structure that was ever created by man .
It has a 300 million or molecular weight .
If you stay it with a caratter 10 without spaces , you would like to 142 pages only to transcend this code .
Now , how do we do it work ? How can we activate it ?
Of course , you tramed a virus is a game of kids .
It 's a little bit more complicated when you use bacteria .
It 's simply simple when it comes from eucariote like our , you can simply extract the nucleus and put another one , which is basically the process of cloning .
In the archael bacteria , it 's instead of integrated inside the cell , but we recently demonstrated that we are able to do a complete trapieces of a cell chromosoma from another and to activate it .
We clear a chromosoma starting from a microbial species .
The two are different as men from the mouse .
We 've added some genes more so that we could decide what to this chromosoma .
And then , it 's the enables in a way to kill all the proteins .
And when we put it in in the cell was stupendo-- and you 'll appreciate our sophisticatoo-- the new crumosophisticatomic graphics went into the cell .
And we began to think we couldn 't go beyond , but we tried anymore in there .
This is one of the major mechanisms of evolution .
We found that many species have added a second or a third chromosoma somewhere , adding in a second thousand tracks in a second thousand tracks that species .
So who think about evolution as only genes as only genes as a only gene , it didn 't understand much much of the biology .
They have been a enzymes called " restription " that will adverse digerate DNA .
The chromosoma that was in the cell not one .
The cell phone cell cell , which we put it down to the hit .
It 's expressed , and it recognized the other as an extremely express the other as an extremely , and we 've been recognized with only the cell and the new chromosoma .
It has become blue because of the genes we 've put it .
And in a short lasses of time , all the characteristics of a species are gone . And it has transformed all in a new species , based on the new software that we 've put in the cells .
All the protection has changed , the membrane has changed , and when we read the genetic code is exactly what we 've transferred to it .
Now , this may seem to look at genetic genetic , but altering the software , we can change things in a substantial way .
Now , I 've already explained that this is not about genesesign -- but to progress from three million years and a half of evolution , and I 've already said that maybe we 're going to create a new version of Cambriana 's explosion in which will be created new species that will be created new species based on this digital .
Why do that ?
I think it 's pretty obvious when we think about our necessity .
We 're going to go from six billion and a half billion people in the next 40 years .
Right for example : I was born in 1946 .
Now there are three people on the planet for each one existing in 1946 , there will be four .
We 're having problems now to find food , fresh water and a drug , medical and the benzin for six billion and a half billion people .
It 's going to be even more than that for nine billion .
We use more than five billion carbon carbon , more than 30 billion baries of oil .
That means a hundred millions of baries a day .
When we try to find biological processes , or any kind of process to replace them , it will be a huge challenge .
We have to keep the whole emission of all the emission of CO2 from these materials that ended up in the atmosphere .
At the day , thank you to scientific discoveries all over the world , we have a database with about 20 million genes , and I like to think they are designed for the future .
The electronics is only a dozen dozen about components , and think about how many different things are coming out .
Our limitations are constructed by the biological reality and our imagination .
Now we have some techniques , because of these rapid methization , in order to create what we call fight genomics .
We can build a big robot that can produce a million crumosomes a million crumosomes a day .
Think of processing these 20 million genes or different genes of tried to get to get the processes to produce eighttary or drugs , new vaccines , and we can change , thank you very small team , now that in the last 20 years of science .
And it 's just a standards .
We can choose for a chance of survival , chemical production or fuel , or chemical production , or chemical production .
This is an instantaneous instantance of some software programmed that we 're working to be able to seats and design species in the computer .
Well , we don 't necessarily know how it will be .
We know exactly how their genetic code .
Now we 're four-generation of fourth generation .
You have seen you that extract ethanol from the gram was a event that was a finished experiment .
We have a second and third generation of the second generation that will be used to be soon in the higher of value as the eight-of butants as well as the eight-to-ran or different kinds of butants .
But the only way that biology can have a big impact without increasing more than the cost of food and limitarne the cost of food and limitary wildlife would transformer transforming cells , and we think about making cells that can reach this purpose , and we think of that , and we think of that we think about four four times as generation in about 18 months .
The solunlight with CO2 is a metodo-- but in our discoveries in our discoveries , we 've found different metods .
This is a organism that we described in 1996 .
I live in the deep ocean , about 2,500 feet of depth in the water temperature of water .
They create metry metry from CO2 to molecular as a source of energy .
We 're trying to understand if we can incanalate CO2 , which can easily be transported through the cluster , to convert that CO2 in carbon , to drive this process .
So , we think that we could be able to increase what the basic question of " which is , " What 's life " Noi , verlaw 's a hoothing is , we have the goal to replace the whole thing that is , we can be able to get the whole thing that is , we can be able to increase the whole chemicals industry .
Exactly . If you can 't do it from TED , where you can ?
It would be a main fource of energy .
And we 're also working to use the same metods to create vaccines .
You 've seen this year with influence , we 're always going back to a year and with a dollar when it comes to find the right vaccine .
I think what you can change with fight vaccines in ancient vaccines in ancient tiny .
Here 's how the future could start looking at , now , the tree of evolution , now , to evolution to synthetic bacteria , which was arches , which is , which is , which is , and initial cell .
We are so from the improve people .
Our purpose is to do that , so long enough to try to do it . Thank you very much .
First of all I 'm going to show you , the fastest , some fundamental work , the new technology that we 've taken Microsoft in the following purchase a year ago . This is Seadragon .
It 's a environment that you can interact is at the local level that you can interact with a huge amount of visual data .
Here we are seeing a lot of gigabyte of digital phoom with a kind of zoom and continuous , for a panoramic fast , and it 's a picture of a panoramic photos , and we have the images like we want .
And it doesn 't matter how much much much much of information we see , how big these things are big , or the images .
Most are digital photographs , but this is a scan from the library of the library from the Library of Congress , and it reenter in the gamples of 300 megaxpile .
It doesn 't make any difference because the only thing that 's the only thing that 's the prestations of a system like this is the number of pixels on your screen in any time . It 's also a very flexible .
This is a book , example of data not images .
This is Casa desolate Dickens . Every colonna represents a chapter .
To show you that it 's just about it , and not images , we can do something like that , to actually see that it 's a real real representation of the text , not a picture .
It could be a little bit artificial to read a electronic book .
Not a advice .
This is a more realistic example . It 's a number of The Guardian .
Each image is the beginning of a section .
And it gives you the pleasure and the behind you and the behind the version cardry of a magazine , which is for a lot of a quote , which is for a molteplant .
We also did something with the angle of this particular number of The Guardian .
We 've created a higher advocultural advocation -- much higher than what you use in a normal advertising .
If you want to see the characteristics of this automobile , you can see here .
Or other models , or even the specific techniques .
And this really demonstrates some of these ideas to eliminate the space of space on the screen .
We hope that this is to put up to the end of a pop-up and other porcheries , and not to be necessary .
Of course , the map is one of the most obvious applications for this kind of technology .
And I don 't want to lose time , if I don 't mean we have contribute to give them in this field .
These are all the streets in the United States underlifetime on a NASA .
So , we 're going to go out to something else .
This is now now , it 's actually from the Web ; you can go to see it .
It 's a project called Photosynthetic , which combine two different technologies .
One is Seadragon and the other is a visual computer computer computer that 's interesting by Noah Snavely , a student University of Washington , with Steve Seitz of UW Seitz , with Steve Seitz Seitz Rick . " A op-to-Microsoft Rick . " A op--collaboration collaboration .
And it 's from the Web , managon from Seadragon .
You can see it when we do this type of screens , where we can spend from a image to the other image , and have this kind of experience to the last multiple .
But the space collocation of the images here has actually a meaning .
The algorithms of computers have record these images together , so that they have been screamed these images together , so that you can imagine -- all the scattack to the Grass on Montagne Rockases -- you on the Montagne Rockings : you see the elements of a slide or imaging ores , and these things have been all lined to the space .
I don 't know if I have time to show you some other environment .
There are some more spaces .
I want to go directly to one of the original data of Noah-- and this comes from a previous prototype of Photosynthtosynthesus that we 've done for the first time last summer summer , and I 'm not necessarily evidence that we 've been doing is really the key key to this technology , Photosyntheses . And it 's not necessarily evident that we put in the website .
We had to worry about legal aspects and so on .
This is a reconstruction of Notre Dame images from Flickr , Dame images from Flickr , and you get images of type , and you get images of types in magic . And you have a picture of these ange conoods that 's discovered to this model .
So they 're all images from Flickr and they 've been all linked to space level in this way .
And it 's possible to be able to be able to do this very simple way .
You know , I never thought to end to work for Microsoft .
It 's very gratifying this kind of acafe , you know ,
I think you can see that it 's a lot of different type of photoches : from those of the SLR , a meaning , a meaningful number number meaning , put together in this environment .
And if I can , I try to find those strange more strange .
A lot of them are stuck by doing it , etc .
Somewhere there is a series of photographs -- it 's here .
This is a poster from Notre Dame recorded correctly .
We can go from the poster to the physics of this environment .
The essential point is that we can do things with social environment . This is now taking data from the whole memory of how to apply the land is to how the Earth looks like the Earth , from the sivote of the world 's point of view -- and links to all those data together .
All those pictures become linked together , more of the parts of the parts .
You have a model of the land that you have a model of the land that you 've got a lot of the land .
Think about this as a prolungation of Stephen Lawler on Earth Earth 's virtual .
It 's something that grows in complexity as well as people use it , and the people are going to use it .
Their pictures are hushed with inseries by other people .
If you get somebody comes the idea of contradicing all these things say , my name is , my photographs of Notre Dame suddenly arricich is arricich enriches of all those data , and I can use how to be used to use as a little bit of a place , using the picture of a shelter , using the photograph of anybody , and you have a cross-mooth experience of anybody , and cross-tomoss .
Of course , a consequence of all this is very highly elaborate all of any interesting models of any interesting stuff in the Earth , collected not just as much as you can see an air-like , but by the collective memory .
Thank you .
Chris Anderson : I 've got understood ? What your software is that you 're going to do is that at a certain point , in the next few years , all the photographs share from anybody in the entire world will be practice together ?
BAA : Yeah . What 's doing is doing is actually discovered .
It 's creating hyperlink , if you want , you know , you know ,
And it 's doing it in the bottom of the images .
The thing becomes very interesting if you think about the richness of semantes that many of these images are possible .
As when you do a research on the Web , you digit a sentence and the text on the web page has a lot of information about the images of the picture .
Now , what happens if that picture you connect to all your photos ?
So the amount of semantic interconnection and the amount of riches that are actually going to get it is really enormous . It 's a classical classical classical .
CA : Blaise , it 's really incredible . Compliment .
BAA : I thank you very much .
One of the main pleasure when you travel and one of the ethnographics of the etnographics is that we can live in in those who don 't forget the ancient traditions , between who has been the past in the wind , you 're going to stick in the leverte , you 're going to in the levert of the plants .
Basti thinking about monkeys Jaguar vide still beyond the Via Lattea , or that the advice mites are still still himalone of meaning , or that in Himalayas , the budy-up , the buddists still in the Dharma , but to remind the central importance of the ances of the anthropology , and that the idea that the world in which we live in which we live 't live in the absolute , but it 's not really a very much , absolute ,
the consequence of a particular adaptative choices that our estrpe has done , well or a lot of generations ago .
And , of course , we all share of essential traits .
Everybody is . We all promise .
We are subjects to start .
We have to deal with the inexorability of death , so we don 't surprise us if we can 't whose dry us .
all of us have an art .
What collips is the rhythm particular of the song , the rhythm of dance .
Not matter that they are the Penan forest of the Borneo , or the following Vodoo 's the Kenya , or the desert of Kenya , or the desert of Kenya , or a Specentrional , or a cammboard in the heart of the Sahara .
He was my journey of journey in the desert a month ago , or a yak in the yak of Qomolan , on Everest , the dead .
All these populations teaching us are other ways of thinking , other ways of existing ways of thinking , other ways of moving in the world .
And if you think , if you think that 's a concept that it can give you hope .
In fact , the myries of the world create a spiritual ragnote of the world and cultural life that is important for the well-being of the planet and it 's important to the planet as a biosphere .
And you can think of this cultural rague as a nine ethnosphere and you can call the total sum ethnosphere , all of all the concepts , dreams , ideas , intuitions , intuitions layed to be from the behind human imagination from the alba of conscious .
The etnosphere is the fantastic patriage of humanity .
It 's the symbbol of what we are and what we can be in how much unquisitive species .
And because biosphere was gravening it was so much more consumed . And so , it was very quickly consumption .
Nobody biological , for example , would say that 50 percent of all species is on the ords of the extinction , because it 's fake , or or the other people -- in the argue that 's the most apocaly-hoittical diversity -- and you don 't even get close to the more optimistic issues -- the cultural diversity .
The index is , of course , the language loss .
When you were 6,000 languages on this planet .
A language is not only composed by a vocabulary or or a series of grammatical rules .
A language is the sprayer of human spirit .
It 's the half of the animal of every culture comes in the material world .
Each language is a forest , a backin , a backin , a spiritual ecosystem possibilities .
And of those 6,000 languages , as we are sitting in Monterey , at least half the hadn 't come to Monterey , at least half the horecchies of kids .
They don 't get to children , the kids who mean , unless than something , which is not trust something , which are already death .
What is there more sad than being available by the silence , of being the last to talk a language , the way to be the wisdom of the wisdom of the saving of the children ?
This is a photo was a few of somebody in the world every two weeks : every two weeks a smaller , and it brings with the tomble of syllables a old language .
And I know somebody you will say , " Do it 's not the best ?
Wouldn 't it be a better place if you all the same language ? " Benissim , then we talk all yoruba . Let 's talk about the cantonese .
We talk about kogi .
You 'll have a tract thing about a tract thing that can 't talk about your language .
I 'd like to give you a journey through the thnosphere --
a little journey in the etnosphere to give you a asp of what we 're losing .
A lot of us are forgot that when I say , " different ways of existing , " I mean , " I mean different ways of exist .
We take for example this bimbo Barasana , in Amazonia , in Amazon , the anaconda 's population , which creates the myth to come from the river of the snakes of the west snaked in the snaked of sacres .
It 's a popular people who don 't have to distinguish the blue color from the green fluststers because the time you were identified in the forest .
They have a strange language and a quick major , called an exogamia language , " : you have to marry a different language .
And it 's all the roots in the past mythological , supplies the particular particular , is that in these families , and they talk about six or seven language because of marriage marries , no one language .
They limited to listen to and then start talking about it .
We take one of the most interesting tribes that I lived , the Waorani of Ecuador north , an incredible popular popular people had the first contacts in 1958 .
In 1957 missionaries have tried a construct contact mistake .
They had been taken out of photographs that they were rushed in the photographs that they were giving them that this population population had never seen anything bi-dimensional .
They 've been collected the photo from the earth , they spend the research , or a shape and , not finding anything , they would have been on the deal , and they kill the five missionary missionaries with the lance .
But Waorani don 't kill only the strict .
They were killed with them .
Fiflew percent of the mortality was caused by them .
We have rised eight generations and we found two natural death and we found two natural death and when we 've insight to know , they loit that one of them was aged so that he 's dead aging , and then killed him him the same .
The hunters were able to recognize the urine animal from 40 steps and recognize the species .
In the earlier ' 80s , I 've been assigned a very interesting task when my professor of Harvard , if I wanted to go to Harvard me in the secret of the power of Duvalier and Tonton Macodes to the bottom of Duvalier and Tonton Macodes to be able to do the zombie .
I would give a sense of miraculous , I should have understand Vodoun culture . I would have to understand Vodoo is not magic .
It 's pretty much about a complex vision metaphysics of the world .
Very interesting .
If I ask you to tell me the great religions of the world , what would you say ?
Cristian-like , Islam , Buddism , Ebraism , Ebraism , etc .
A continent is always leave out , thinking that sub-Saharan Africa has no religious feeling . And instead of the Vodoo is not the other than the distilside of these religious concepts in the tragic concepts of the slavery of a lot of profound ny of the slavism .
What makes the voodoo is the intense ran intrase ring between life and death .
So , you know , you have to hide the spirits .
The spirits can be invoced by the Great Acqua , they response to the rhythm of the dance and they have time to the soul of the vial way that for a short moment , the following becomes the god .
That 's why voodooists love to say " You biankish you go to the God .
We say in the time and we divent God and we say God . "
And since you 're married , is it spirit that you 're driving , how can you do it ?
So you have these incredible events : following voodoo in the traance of trance that touch impunties that touch impuntizes of the power of the mind when it 's catalyzed in a state of extreme .
In all the populations with which I 've been visited the most extraordinary Kogi in Sierra Nevada Santa Marta , in the Santa Marta , in the Santa Marta Marta .
Does of the ancient civilization that once once they lived on the caraibial plants of Colombia in the conquer , the popular people were ritized on the vulcanic massive plants that you were on on the vulcanic massive planning .
In a continent macchieved by blood continent , this popular is never been conquisted by the Spanish .
But the fact , they 're governmented by a clero , but their formation is so extraordinary .
The young people are brought away from families to the families to three or four years , and they live in a buy world and shadow in a world 's made of a fall-to-bottom of the ice for 18 .
Two day-nine years choices to reproduce the nine months of management that spend in the usage of the mother , now are metaphorically in the ushands of Mother .
So , for all this time , they 're acculturate values of their society , values that predicts their prayers and only their prayers are the cosmic balance , or to say the ecological balance .
At term of this incredible initiation , they 're suddenly landed out and for the first time in life , at 18 , they see a alba . And in that active of conscious conscious about the first butter , when the sun sun is the landscape , all that they learn in theory is constructed in theory . And the first one step it back and says , and it 's saying , " "
" Wissue ? Proprise how I said .
It 's really about it . Now it 's going to protect it . "
They call them greater and they say that we , brothers , and they are the dyes , we are the collide of destruction of the world .
This is very important .
When we think about Ingences and the environment and invote the environment of the noble story of wild , which is a razer concept in its simplicity or maybe invoice . We 're near Thoreau and we say these people are closer .
The Ingenes are not feeling or feeling or nostality from the nostalgia .
There 's no space for these things in the malaric paludi or the wind of the Tibet , but thank you for the time and rump , they 've created a mystical thing of the Earth is not about concept of essercially awakaker , but on an intuition of the Earth can live only only only only only only because it 's unclear .
What does that mean ?
It 's saying that a boy of Ande who grows up the mountain is a spiririt of Apu who will leave his destiny , a human being deeply different , and it 's going to have a very different human being a different way with the mountain a little bit different rump of the Montana who grow up in the Montana who grow up a mountain mass of rocks to be scaved .
That 's the dimmora or a spirit or a mineral was irrelevant .
What 's interesting is is the metaphor that defines the relationship between individual and the natural world .
I grew up in the forest of Columbia credary credying that forest would be ced .
What I 've made me a human being different from my friends Kwauters who believe that the forest is Hukukuk and the bar of the paradise and the bis historic and the spirits that are living in the summer , we 're going to deal with during the Hamatsa initiation .
If you start looking at that these cultures could create different reality , you could start to understand some sensors of their own feelal feelings . Let 's do this plants .
I 've taken this picture to april up in the nordocccrossing Amazon .
Mayahuasks , you 've heard about the ayahuasks , the most powerful psychcoat of the chiamanic repertoire .
What makes it fascinating the ayahuasks is not the major potential of the substance of the substance , but his elaboration . It 's composed to two elements .
On one side , this lian lian lian lift set of beta-carboline , harmolines and harmolines , harmolines , slightly allucinogens .
Take the only plants , it has a bluststers that altery a little bit of the consciousness , but it 's measured by a hand-leaves of the coffee family , " Psychotria vist of the coffee ,
This plants have triptamine , very similar to serotonin , very similar to the serotonin , a methoxypttamine .
If you 'll ever see Yanomami to pull the nose that they do with a different species , which are contained with a different species , anchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchcheap .
I think about that poor is a little bit like being disappear from a little bit of a painting of paintings and lands to land on a bunch of electricity . [ Risate not creates a distorsion . It 's not creates a distorsion of reality .
I was often a lot of my professor , Richard Evan Shultes , the man who has been skept the man who had been psychedelical , with his discovering fungi of the hallucinogenic fungi in the ' 30 in Mexico .
I think my text , you can 't classificate these triptamines as well hallucinogens because you can 't tell anybody to be hallucinated . I mean , the trippptamine , but it 's not not to be assually .
It 's possible to look at the horrise of the chemicals that denize the MAO .
Now , the beautiful carbons , the carbons that are in this lian lian ifth of MAO , the same type of necessary to potentiate tripptamine . The question is spontaneous question : in a flour popular , how do these popular people , how these popular people have to find two department diogenic species , but if you combinate in this way , crea biochemical version that is sus ?
We use the great eupherror and the error , which can reveal infruit .
But if you ask the Indians , they 'll tell us , " We 're planning to us . "
What does that mean ?
This tribes , the Cofan , has 17 variety of ayahuasks , which are nice that are nice in the forest , and that our eyes would go into the same species .
If you ask them how to stbilift their tassonomes will tell us " I was thinking about it it 's plants , and I said , " No . "
The solution is : you take the 17 variety of a full of moon and each other will be with a different .
With this doesn 't graduate us to Harvard , but it 's much more interesting than content the stones .
Now , [ applausi ] the problem is that even the people of our own own own heart people find them paintings are in the paintings , but somehow reducts in the history of the real world , and pass .
In fact , the 20th century , in 300 years , it 's not going to remind for his gueres or innovation , but rather as the one was where we stopped and actively actively or accepted passively , or accepted by the major of biological diversity of the planet . Now the problem is not the change .
All cultures were involved in a dance for new possibilities of life .
And the problem is not technology .
The Indians Sioux , they don 't have stopped to be Sioux when they put in the arc and recage as they have been stopped by the horse and calute .
It 's not the change or the technology that threatening the integrity of the thnosphere . It 's the power .
The flight flight of the domination .
And if you give a look at the world , you 'll find that these are not destinated cultures are destinated cultures .
They are living creatures and dynamics out of the hyperforces out of the hyentificable forces that go beyes behind their training capacity .
I think of disboscation in the pathries of Penan ...
a popular noad of Sarawak , in the Sarawak , a popular people who lived lived in the forest to a generation ago , and now reduced to the servitoes and now reduced to the servitoes , where you can see the river 's reverse that it seems to be able to take place to the back of the southern Meridional Meridional , where the naves are briese to the horizon the horizon ,
With the forest sting states with the subtact wood .
Or , in the case of Yanomami , are the disease that have come with the discovery of the golden .
If we move on on the mountains of Tibet , where I 'm doing a lot of research , you 'll see the hard flight flight flight flight .
As you know , genocide , the physics of a popular , is a universal level , but the ethnocide , the destruction of life , not only is construction , but addicted in certain environmental circuit , because it does part of the development of a popular development .
And you can 't understand the suffering of Tibet until it comes from the beginning .
I have been over 6,000 miles from Chengdu in Western China through Tibet Surging , coming to Lhasa young colleague , but only came to Lhasa young colleague , but only came to Lhasa . I realized what we 're going to talk about .
6,000 sacres sticks in the pollust and hold .
1.2 million people killed by the military Revolution .
The dad of this guy was ascriticized to Panchen Lama .
which means that it was killed in the Chinese invasion of Chinese invasion .
Humo uncle is fighting with Sua Santity in Santity , he 's been fighting in Nepal .
Sua mother was imprigioned and his colpe was rich .
It was brought to the age of two years from two years , hidden deeply under his walk because he couldn 't live without him .
The sister , which did the same , it was put in reeducational field .
A day he put a day in a window fashion , a window , and for this transgression , it was mit to seven years old .
The Tibet 's pain is unbet , but the recently spirit of the popular is kept .
And it 's all over , it reduces a choice .
We want to live in the monothic world of monoonia or do we want to account the polycles of diversity ?
The great anthropologists Margaret Mead , before he died that his biggest paar was that , in our way to this lower view of love , not just see the entire gama of human imagination reduced to a very limited modality of thinking , but one day , you know , we 'll get up from a sleep to a sleep .
And it 's humiliant to remember that our species is exist for 60,000 years .
The Neolitica Revolution , which has gives us agriculture , which has done us underlifetime to the seed of the smoke of the smoke of the smoke of clero , and we talk about 10,000 years ago .
The modern industrialized world has 300 years old .
That 's a story not suggest to me that we have the answers to all the challenges that we will have to do in the millennia to come to the millennia to come to .
When to these myriades of the world is asked what it means to be human , they respond with 10,000 different voices .
And it 's in these answered answering the possibilities of being what we are : a kind of a conscious kind of , which has to do that all people are going to fire . And there 's great moments of optimism .
I 've been taken this picture on the northern extremity of Baffin the island , when I went to the balene with the Inuit , Olaya , Olaya , Olaya , Olaya , he told me the wonderful story of his grandfather .
The English government was not always given to the Inuit 's population and in the 1950s to stabilifetes our supremiracy , we 've got them in colonies .
The grandfather of this man refutter to go .
The family , I teming her life , I 'll take it all the tools .
You have to know that Inuit don 't temat the freeze , they do it .
The pattins in origin were made of fishing slitte in the skin .
The grandfather of this man didn 't have it to the night or from the library night or from the library .
It 's sgattaiolled , it 's calculated the ptall in the photos and defecated in your hand . When I did the photos , they 've been doing it .
It 's got spring on the dog of this hell and when it became solid , he killed a dog .
It has taken the dog and created a grid , with the check cass made a slitta , he 's imbrillied another dog and it 's disappear on the bchisa , hit to the check , he 's hit on the shell .
We want to talk about cavarsely with nothing ? [ Risate ] . And this , in different ways , [ Applausi is the symbol of the Inuit 's population and all the Inusters of the world .
In the april 1999 , the canadd government redied to the total control of an area of an area of a bigger territory of an area of the biggest California and Texas monx together .
It 's the new paper . It 's called Nunavut .
It 's an independent territory . They do all the mineraries .
One of the people of how a natione-state can recognize with his people .
And , to finish , I think it 's pretty obvious at least to those of us was in these remote aren 't really remote .
For somebody 's home .
They represent sexual imagination that risk up to the date of the temples . And for all of these children , like dream of kids , like dream are part of our children , become part of geography of hope .
From to the end , we are National Geographic , we 're convinced that politicians will never come anything .
We believe that the polemies --
[ Applausi is not persuasive , but we believe that the stories would change the world , and maybe we 're the best institution to tell the stories of the world . Each month is to tell the stories of the world . Each month is is 35 million visiting .
156 countries spread our television canal canal canal canal canal canal canal .
Our rists are being thletters from millions of people .
Our work is traveling in the ethnosphere to bring our audience in places that are going to go through how they have seen as well as well as they have seen and , they will hope , above the central reveal in the middle of anthropology : the world 's world to exist in the diversity , and we have to find a life in a pluralist and multicultural world in a pluralist and multicultural places in a pluralist and multicultural reveal .
where the wisdom of all the populations can contribute to our collective well-being collective well-being .
Thank you .
I 'm going to talk about some things that I wrote in this book that I hope you 've already heard and I 'm going to try to prove some of the links , in case not notice them .
I want to start with what I call the dogma official dogma .
The official doggma thing ?
The official dogma of all the Western society society , the Western official dogma official dogen , " If we want to massive our citizens . "
The reason is , from a side , in fact that freedom is in itself a value , is is predictable , essential for human beings .
Our other is that if we are free , each one of us can act for doing it for doing it all that that massimilar our well-being , without no one that decides to our name .
The way to massive freedom is massive choice .
More choices people have , more libed , and more is their freedom , and the more is their beneath .
This , I think , it 's so deeply road in society that nobody would dream to put it in the doubt .
And it 's also roadicated in our lives .
I 'm going to show you some examples of what progress has made possible .
This is my supermarket . It 's not particularly big .
I 'm just just a simple note on the saved .
In my supermarket are 175 conditions , without content the extray of oil and extray the oil and 12 aceters , which you can buy it for a huge number of conditions in the inct circumststance that nobody of the 175 proning your degrees .
That 's how the supermarket .
Then you go to the electronic stereo to buy a stereo : casse , CD lector , radio , piahand , the left-up .
And in this single electronic store , there 's a big number of audio components .
We can make six million and a half of different fight with the components that there are only one store .
You have to admit that there is a lot of choice .
Other camps : the world of communications .
Once , when I was a child , you could get all the telephone services , at the package that were fornites from Mom Bell .
It was a cameras , you didn 't buy it .
A consequence of that , by the other thing was that the telephone never stayed .
These days are gone .
Now , we have a variety of telephones , especially between cell phones , especially between cell phone .
Here 's cell phone .
My favorite is that in the middle , MP3 , cuts of nose , and hang for the brulele me to the bad goods .
If you haven 't got it in the store under the house store under the store , you 're pretty much going to get .
And what happens is , people go into the negots and it 's this question . And you know what 's the answer ? The answer is " No . "
It 's not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn 't do too much .
So , in other things about life that are much more important than the aquists , you know the same explosion of choices .
Axxxistence : no longer in the United States that you go from the doctor and the doctor you say what to do .
Instead , you go to the doctor , and the doctor says , " OK , we could do A , or B , " A has these benefits and these things . " Be has these benefits and these risks . What do you want to do ? "
You say , " Dotic , what should I do ? "
And the doctor says , " A has these benefits and these sks , and you have these benefits and these risks . "
" What do you want to do ? "
And you rebits : " Dotic if she was me , what would you do ? "
And the doctor : " But I 'm not . "
We call it the result of the malath of malath , " expression that makes it look like a beautiful thing .
But it 's not that one to move the weight and responsibility to make somebody who knows something , which is the doctor , to somebody else knows anything , and almost certainly is maled -- and so much much much is maled -- and so it doesn 't in the ideal condition to make the patient .
There 's a huge marketing of drugs products , directly to people like me and you , that if you think about it 's not a sense , because we can 't buy them .
But if we can 't buy them , because the public icizes them ?
The answer is that they want to say that doctor , we call the doctor to ask them to change the recipe .
What of this fundamental as our identity is our identity is a choice question , as you see in this dream . " We don 't want to forcing kids . " I don 't want to forced their own time . " We don 't know more a identity : we need to invent it .
And we can reinvented how many times us do it .
That means that every morning , you have to decide that kind of person want to be .
I think about the family and marriage , a time perspective , a time perspective , unhappy for anyone , was that you were married the most soon possible , and it was that it was that you have the most soon as possible .
The only green choice was with who , not when , and even when , and even even what to do after .
Over day , it 's really to play .
I teach students very smart students , and I do 20 percent than a time .
And it 's not because they 're not good , not because they 're less diligent .
but why am I impenerit , I mean , I 'm going to marries me or not ? Would I do it now ? "
" Would I say you marries me later ? I have to think before or the career ? "
They are interruptive interruptive .
And they try to answer these questions , even if this implic not complete the compitors and not get a beautiful vote to my exame .
And they have to do it . I 'm important questions .
Now , the work : we are lucky , like Carl underneath , because technology allows us to work every minute , every day , from every day , from every day , from every day , from every day , from every day , from the Hotel Randh .
I 'm talking about , there 's a angle , and I 'm not going to tell anybody what , where the WiFi works .
I don 't tell you , because I want to use it .
What does this mean , this incredible freedom of choice that we have to work ? It 's that we have to do it ? It 's not that .
We can go to see our son toy toys , with cell phone in a cell phone , Blackberry in the other , and the tebook , typically , on the ginocchia .
And even if they 're all spent , every minute that we see our son 's children , we 're also asking the partners , we 're also asking this called ? "
" I have to answer this email ? I have to get this letter ? "
And even when the answer is " no , " all this makes the experience of your own son , very different son from what would be in other conditions .
So , from any part , little and big things , big and big , materials and styles of materials and styles of life , life is a question of choices .
Of the world was this : Ovable , there were some possibilities , but it was not a question of choice .
The world of today looks like this : The dilemmma is , " Is it positive , or negative ? "
The answer is Surging .
The positive layers , we know all , so I 'm going to talk about negative those .
This is this choice compories two negative effects on people .
The first , is , it 's a lot of production , instead of liberation .
With a lot of options between which choices , becomes very difficult to do it .
I give you an example : a study conducted on planning planning of voluntement plans .
A connects to a Vanguard data from Vanguard , the gigantic society , with about a million clients in a 2,000 companies .
What she has discovered is that for every 10 solutions that are offered in more , the percentage of two percent .
With 50 offer-offer-four-offer-four-than adhesions , and it 's only five . Why ?
Because with 50 fources between which I choose , it 's sick , it 's sick , and choice is remained to the initional tomorrow .
And I ask tomorrow , and I ask tomorrow , and of course , and of course , and of course , it never comes .
You know that it doesn 't just mean that these work from old who are going to send them to food because they don 't have enough money , it 's so osticks , even though the decision is so osticking that even the fundamental fundamental dators of work .
Don 't participating , they 're losing up to five dollars from the work of work , which would be very well disposed to them .
So , the paralysis is a consequence of having too many choices .
And I think that makes the world like that .
" And to finish finally , for ethernity : ketchup , senape or maion ? "
You would take the right decision , if it 's for ethernity , is it ?
You don 't want to choose the wrong bag , and you know the wrong condition .
So this is the first effect . The second is that we even have to avoid the paralsis and do a choice , we 're less , at the end , we 're less , we were in the result of how we would be with less options between which choices .
And this for different reasons .
One of these is that with many people who choose , if you buy a lot of them , and it 's not really easy to imagine that you would have a different choice that would have been better . And what happens is that 's that the alternative to imagine you might be better . And what happens is that the alternative to imagine , and the repair the soddisfer the sodatic decision , and the repair the sodatic decision of the resdatic decision ,
even when it was a very good decision .
There are more choices , more is easy displeasure than any detail that 's unsodatives of choice .
And also , there 's what economists call expensive opportunity .
Dan Gilbert has close very well stamattine as the value that we do with things depends on what we confronted them .
The rest , when there are lots of options , it 's easy to represent the characteristics of the alternative ars and be less sodatives of the option that you have choice .
Here 's an example . I 've been schools with all the ones that are not New York .
But that 's what you would probably think of .
There 's this couple of Hamps .
A place of lussian .
It 's pay lendida . Ottime . It 's all about them .
Not nothing . But what he thinks is , " Well , sick , sick , it 's Agoen . "
" Everybody neighbors in Manhattan are away . "
" I could talk about it right in front of the home . "
And it 's about two weeks of assillated by the idea that 's losing -- every day -- the possibility of parking where it wants .
The constoopportunity diminished the soddisfaction for what we have , even when choice was a cell .
And more are the options that we have to think about , more the characteristics will return us into the expensive .
Here 's another example .
This is a lot of things .
It 's about living the moment , and maybe to live in the likely .
But the most important point is that anything you choice , you know , you know , you don 't do the other .
The things that we don 't choose to have a lot of active , they can make less active what we do .
Three point : spiral growing of expectations .
I tried it on my skin buying a new jeans .
I 'm always jeans .
Once the jeans were just a type , you buy them and besty , they were discomodissians , just after having them a life and work a lot of times , they were starting to go well .
So I went to buy a couple of a new when those who were gone , and I said , " I need a couple jeans , this is my cutting . "
The committer committed me , " Li wants slim , fit , relaxed ? "
Do you want to the cernier with the bottons ? " Stonewashed or " " or " acidwashed ? "
" Loooks , " Loook at it ? "
" Have them to them or cocococoat . Bla bla bla -- " Continured it .
I was sbalord , and after a little bit , I could say , " I want the guy who was the only guy , " I want the guy to do it . " I want to all the jeans , and I tried to say , " I want the jeans , and I was out of the best thing , I 've ever had .
It was the massive . With all that choice I had the best .
But I felt a worse .
Why ? I 've written a whole book to understand it .
The reason I was worse to is that with all that choices were very high , the jeans had to be perfect .
I was a little bit of an earlier . I didn 't expect to anything except when it was a guy , but when I saw 100 different steps , steps , at least a guy had to be perfect .
What I was buy , but not perfect .
After I was a chosen with what I was looking for me in confronted with the expectations .
And add options in life does not do that increasing the expectations that these are respect to the ecbile of the same .
And this will proof less satisfaction , even when the results are good .
Nobody in marketing and realized .
Because if they knew , you wouldn 't know what I 'm talking about .
The truth looks more like this .
" He was better when it was worse or " The reason that was better when it was worst , it was even worst , when it was worst still possible meeting of the surprised .
Over day , in the world we live in -- opulent citizens with the expectancy of feeling -- the massive that we can hope is that things are at the alteness of expectations .
You never have surprised as much as well as your expectations , my expectations , my expectations , I 'm ingigantic .
The secret of happiness -- what you 're here -- it 's , " Bick expectations . " Yes , you want . "
I mean , little careth-biographic , which are really married and my wife is really stupend .
I couldn 't do it better , I didn 't have any content .
But it 's not always a bad thing is not always a good thing .
Finally , a consequence of buying a couple of jeans discovering when there is only that jeans is that when you 're not satives , and you ask , " Why ? "
" Who is responsible ? " " , the answer is close .
The world is responsible . What could I do with it ?
When there are hundreds of kinds of jeans , and you buy a disfacing insoddisfacing , and you ask who is the responsible , it 's pretty clear that the responsible you .
You could have done better .
With hundreds of variety of variety available , there are no scan .
So when people take decisions decisions , even if the result is the alid , they feel satives and give the colm to them and give the colm to them themselves .
In the last few years , the depression is exploded in the industry world .
I think that a meaningful factor -- not the only one , but important -- of this wave of depression is that people have a deludents because standards standards are too high .
And when they have to explain this situation they think that colve is they think that colve is them .
So the final result is that we 're in general , objectively , but we feel worse .
Let me remember you .
This is the official dogma , what we all take for good and it 's completely fake . It 's not true .
There 's no doubt that a little bit of choice is better than I don 't have any business , but it doesn 't really hit , but it doesn 't really take a little bit of a little bit .
There 's a critical value , I don 't know what it is .
But I 'm sure that we 've been done by a piece of the piece of the level where choices are improve .
Now , from political view -- I almost finished -- from the political point , the nocction is the following .
What allows us all this choice in the industrial society is the material wealth .
There are many places in the world , and you know , you know , where the problem is not that they have any choice .
The problem is that they have too long .
So the factory I 'm talking about is a males to be executives of modern , rich society .
And what it does depress and climbing is this : Steve Levitt talabout how much those expensive and pursuit of the expensive and the seats of money is injuries . It 's a spring of money .
I mean these choices , complicated and avoid , it 's not that they 're useful .
I 'm addicted deleteries .
They do them worse .
If a little bit of what our society in our society allows a lot of choice was reversed in those where people have too much possibilities , it would not just have their life to improve but our life .
This is what economists call a paretian improve improve improve .
A redistribution redistribution to all -- not only to poor or -- because of this choice in excess , which is that we go back .
To conclude , " You can be the hilling , you can become all the way . "
You , people of culture , you think , " But what does that fish ? "
" It 's obvious that you can 't do anything in a glass box . "
" A castrayed , a limited vision of the world -- "
and I 've got the interpreted that , I 've got the way that , at the beginning .
But then , I think , instead , I realized that that the fish is long .
Because the reality of the fact is that if you miss in the bottom , so that " all is possible " you can 't get the freedom .
If you breaks the box in a way that all divent possible diministring satisfaction .
You get the paralysis , and you reduced the well-being .
Everybody need a sphere .
This is almost certainly too closely , maybe even for the fish , and certainly for us .
But the absence of a few symbolic sphere is a recipe for childhood .
Thank you very much .
