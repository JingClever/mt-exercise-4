They 've been showed these diamage to show that the cell of the cyyynamics , which for three million years , which for almost three million years , they had the world , which is removed in the United States .
But in fact , this is a lot of the problem because it doesn 't have the spent of ice .
The cover of the bottom of the climate , in a sense , the cucucurious system .
You know , you know , and you 're going to be able .
The next diapositive will be a very quickly , the next dients of the last 25 years .
The ice ice ice ice , there are sour-to-hand-to-to-hand-hand-hand-hand-hourself .
As you see , you can see , you can see it .
What is the ice is the ice in invers , which you 're ritionate .
You can see that the cosidden , and it 's about five years or more , it 's like the blood of the body .
In 25 years , it 's in this , and so .
This is a problem because the rethereas the result of the ocean around around the ocean in the ocean , where there are enormous amount of carbon , where there are the amount of carbon , they 're transformed in in the microbes .
Right to the toxist of inquining tox-talks to the amount of of the deal , that 's not around this point of not all .
In some lagey provide in Alaska half of the water .
The professor Katey Walter of Alaska , is actually actually a team of a team , is just a team of a fast , in the middle of the bottom .
Video : Wow ! Gore : Loo 's good . The question is if we 're going to be able .
It 's why this recenter is that this recenter Groenland from the North .
This is a fix-regime .
The handed never reach them to be like .
This is the fix Kangerlussus , in the sudden of the Groenland .
If you want to know how to smark the level of the sea , and there is where you reach the sea .
These are aumenting in the taumental .
So , the other part of the planet : Antars , the most blown of ice ice ice .
The month , the scientists have dichieved that the ice of ice is in negative , and that Antarargument , which Antarargument on some of the ice , which is , in fact , is , in fact , it 's actually in the neg-to-s-sourself in the ice ,
Equoook at 6 feet , like in Groenland .
SulHimalaya , the third block of ice , you see new lagey , who 's a few years ago , they were ice ice .
The 40 percent of the population was half of the water .
Sulle Ande : this ice ice is the ice of water is the water .
The hold is aumented .
So when you didididididididididididididididied .
In California the neve on the Siar .
The wilild are in crisis .
The prevision , like you know , you know , you 're sitting .
The growth of course , in the door to a remarkable of the inenge .
The disaster is aumental of the normal and without precedents .
Frounded the bigger than 75 years than 75 .
This is a and-and-instainable .
If you look at the context , if you can see the consequence .
In the last 5 years we add 70 million ton-year-old old old , 24 hours -- 25 million ton-year-old old ,
Look at the area of the Pacific area of the North of of the human human , and on the parts of the subject of the subject , where there is a radical roror in the ocean .
The most of the rethore of global warming , and that 's the 20 percent , which is the inforestation , is the use of the deal , is the use of the deal .
The oil is a problem , and the oil is even even even worst .
The United States is one of the United States is one of the United States is .
And you had to proposition of a lot of the neural of carbon .
But we 're going to be in a changing changing .
These are the projects in the last few years and some projects in the last few years and projects .
So , there 's a lost in our Paese .
The industries of the oil and oil have speso 250 million dollars in the last year for promomoves the miles to move the mimile , which is a ossix-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-to-industrial industry .
What the picture of me to me to something --
So Natal Natal , in Tennesesesesesesesesesesesesesesesesespecies .
Maybe you saw on the notion .
This is the second bigger faster of the last phooday .
It happened around Natital .
The mimimile of one industry was this .
Video : Frosty the rosty is a kind of , and I 'm like a kind of happy .
It 's in America , and it 's growing our economy .
Frosty the carbon is always ,
It 's a good piece , and they 're working and work and work .
Gore : So , here is a part of the West Virginia .
The bigger society is Massea is Massey of the moundyyourself .
Video : Don Blankenship : Sarry , Nancy Peless . Nancy Peless , Harry Peless -- not not sitting .
Gore : So , the Aleance for the Clima has been luck .
This is a part of it , one part .
Video : Acore ore : At COALergy we see the changes like a sery of a sery of the business .
So , this is investigation is to be able to a big amount of money in a lot of money to make it .
In fact , the carbon is not sporite .
We think is , it 's a good good good , it 's also a good good ,
So , not previous change .
Let me do do to us .
Video : Acore ore : Carbone -- you 've heard about .
So , I 'm going to go to a structure in a deal structure in a mile of the mile .
Straordinary . The machine are a little bit of the car , but this is the sus of technology .
The consummulti-to-to-based on the main of the remarkable of technology , but the night is that you see in all .
You have an occurrent : this is the odierlit technology .
At Gore : In the end , the alternative , and to the economic economic and to the economic of the economic .
Video : The America is in the crisis is in the economy , the economy , the climate crisis .
The first one that the inspired , our dipendence from the bustable , as the coveral of the oil and oil oil is the oil .
Now , I 'll give it , there 's a new , audace for using it .
Resesesesist of energy , in 10 years .
A plan to reach America to work , and help us to stop the referity , and help help to stop the rithy .
So , in fact , a solution that babs to solution our problems .
Scovers America . Scovers .
Gore : This is the last .
Video : It 's it 's about reach energy to America .
One of the most ways to be more ways to dependence from the dependence of the dependence of our planet .
So , the future is here . It 's here . It 's a new network .
Everybody who are about about .
Syource : It 's a lot of time of being deal .
At Gore : A old old , " If you want to go to leave you , you want to go to fleave .
If you want to go back , and you go together . "
We have to go back , and it 's very quickly .
Thank you very much .
They go to TED in TED ,
And we have to go to to us to get to how the car works on how it works .
So , what 's the most experiment . And for the other time , there was no , the biggest experiment --
This is to reach the conditions that were in less than a million a million than a million times in the universe -- and 600 million times in 600 million times in the universe --
All of what it 's just about the marmary .
This is the car in the Ginevra .
We 're looking at these min-Big Bang in the rights .
This is what I work . It 's called ATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLAS --
This is a picture of ATLATLATLATLAS in building so you can see the proportion .
The 10 , I 'll go to the last year we 've acceso the first time .
And this picture was scape from ATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLAS .
It was because of immense in the forth of control .
It 's a picture of the first fashion of the LHC , and in the LHC , and in collision , with a part of HC , and in the HC , and in the middle in the role in the role .
In other words , when we deal on the 10 of the 10 of the month , we realize that the car work was , which is a great vitten .
I don 't know if it was this to do , and that , when you went on on Google and he was this page .
What means we had a cultural cultural ,
So , a week after , there was a problem with the car , I had to have to this little bit of this , these share .
These are the fix of 13,000 spent hold when the car works on the massive .
Now , the technique between you look at the world and they 'll tell you , " It 's not true . I 'm not not not true . "
And instead they can do it because when they 're very very much of their own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own .
So , at least 271 dead , to a deal , in the space of the space of the space of the space , these share , these fun .
In one of the most of the most of the most of the most of the HC , there was a difaby of the HC , there was a defaby .
So the fix of the fix of the electricicity , and 13,000 spent spent handscreely to a resistence .
This was the result .
Now , this is still more than these magnetic network , if you think that these magnetic netic fast of 20 , and that are been been been been been been in 30 centimeters .
They are dadadadd about 50 magnetwork .
We had to have to be able , what we did .
We restined and were deal and were .
So , they 're going to go to their place .
So , in the end of the marird LHC will be to the new integrated .
We 're going to be , and we 're looking at the right right right , and we 're looking at the right way , and we 're morning and so our available to discovered what they are the universe .
Now , of course , in a way , these framamong , these framage on the value of science and engineering in the value of science and engineering . It 's easy to concertainly .
I think the fact that 's so difficult , the fact to go and the value of things like the LHC .
And I want to say with the words of one , Humphererrey , which , I think , in the defeness of the people who are not to the defeness of his own own , and he 's the great of the human human human human human beyond is , " Niiiel Fadadadadadadd of human human human human human human human human human human human human human human human human .
Thank you .
I want to start to ask you to reach when , you know , you know , and you get the morning .
And as you can get them as reach and we reach them , and they 're going to go and move them , we 're actually going to think and solve problems and we 're going to be able and we 're going to be able and we 're going to be able and we 're going to be able to be able to go and move them , and we 're going to to to think and move them , and we 're going to to think and we 're going to be able to to be able to to be able to to to be able to to to think and make them ,
The reasoning is proviously connection to the way we understand in the world in us .
So , from the information of our internation of our interaction with objects , with objects , and my conflict of the Sackathi , and my construct , I started to ask , and I started to ask me , and when we have a computer , instead of the wood of the wrorote of of of the mouse , and we can 't have to be a digital , and I could have to be a digital , and I could be able to be able to song ,
and sistage ?
The question was so interesting that we decided to explore the answer ,
In a few words , a Siftable computer is a whole computer like a great deal .
In a few words , a Siftable computer is a whole computer like a great deal .
You can move with the hand , you can see , " You can see the way , you can feel the movement and a screen and a screen .
But in fact , I 'm objects , as the morning , as the morning , you can move at the morning .
The Sifly is the example of a new ecool system of a digital system of digital .
And then the hand that become more physical , and you know , and other other other , and and other other other , and that 's the most of the movement , and other people , and we can explore explore new and the different and different and different and different .
So , let 's just just just a simple example .
This Sify is configured to show you , if you can be a direction , the video , the video , the video video , and if you can , you sitting from the other side .
These riters are interactive of other .
If you 're interested in , they 're interested in what 's happening .
If they 're constructed data , and they can aged a little bit .
If they 're constructed data , and they can aged a little bit .
They also have their movement and inlination .
We have to realize that one of the interested of the interaction of the interaction was going to use on the data , and in the way , " a color like if it was a liquid .
In this case , we have three Siffy configured as the nice and I can use them to the color in the middle , where they 're missing .
and I can use them to the color in the cental , where you 're missing .
If we can go too , we can get too , we can put it a bit .
And I 'm also also good , and the math of the way , like the mathematics and games who can be able to be able to be able , and you 'll see the result of the resresult of the result of the result of the space .
Now I 'm --
This is a sequence of Fibonacts that I do with a program of equations .
Here we have a game of words that 's a half of words that 's in Scarabeer and Bobobobject .
Pratically , to every tural , and you can get a literally , Pratically , Pratically , and you have a literally , in the middle of the Sify , and as you know , and as you know , and when you 're looking at the one dionary .
Then , after about 30 seconds of the load , and you have a new new new new .
Thank you .
So here 's what the kids came in the Media Lab , I did it in the way that I was in a video .
And they 're like to sent .
And one of the things like this is that we 're interested is that is not to destanding of people .
You just just say , " Compmps of words , " and they 're going to do that .
So , here 's what they 're going to try .
This is our parts in the most young , there 's the right right .
In fact , it was just wanted to be just to the way .
They just go to the morning ,
Now , this is an application of a whole whole acactive .
We had to build a instrument for the language and he 's Felielix .
It can be able to new active in the middle of the Siftable .
It can be able to new active in the middle of the Siftable .
So , it 's doing , it 's doing the sun .
Video : The smark is surprise .
David Merrill : Now he brought a fast in the scene .
Video : The ror is the ror .
Bel work !
So , in the schools , and they can get to the neighborhood .
Video : Bau !
And , let 's inventing the story .
Video : Wao .
DM : It 's a story with final story with the final story , and you can decide how you want .
DM : It 's a story with final story with the final story , and you can decide how you want .
Video : Vola : Vola .
DM : The last example I have the last example I 've been a instrument , and to make a recent , and exef of music .
It 's a instrument , to make a tiny , for the way .
The Siphphy here are actually from the bottom , the bacteria .
Each one of these have four different variations , and you can get what you can use .
You can see this is , you can see in a sequence from the compories of your lights .
And modificfiction it just to a sle--short , and a sequence . "
These are actually , you can control from the vision , like the ribs and the filter .
The attacts to a particular , and then inced inlands to get .
And then there are the general , and they 're doing , and they applicate to interaction to interaction .
So let 's see how works .
Video : We 're going to go to a bottom in two Siftable , " What we advancy in a series , the way , we add other side .
Now , I 'm going to be a bottom line .
Video : Now , I add of the dead of percent of --
Video : And I 'll give you the bacteria , and I can control the effect from the way .
Video : CM : CM : Camamong the internation of the time from another .
Video : And now I will add the mobile moon on the bottom to be expression .
Video : CM : Cay , I can recombinate the sequence of the sequence .
So , I don 't have to plane , but I can recenter , repreneur .
And now , I can , I can , I can the interaction to the whole mode on on the left Siftable to the left . "
Thank you .
So , how you can see , my passion is build new interactive is build new new interactive as they work as they work in our brain .
And today , I had to show you one of the result of this perhaps , and also some possibility that we 're looking at the laboratory .
And the concept that I want to spent this new generation of objects for objects for the design of objects for interact with media media , which we 'll be in our world in our world in the way we want .
Thank you very much .
I don 't see the right now to talk about you .
I 'm a trust .
It 's my profession is my profession , but it 's more than this , of course .
It 's also the love and the fashion and the hand-life .
And I don 't know that that you can change .
But , he said , this , something particular is successful in my life and in my carrier , which has been to recently recently .
The particular thing is that I recently wrorocently , this kind of biography called " Many , Prra , " which , the way , in the world , and it 's become a great , and it 's hererman , and it 's become a great great great great , and it 's deal , and it 's actually been a great great great great ,
And the result is that anywhere where you can go , people are the people like if you were unknown as if you were .
It 's true --
They 're going to go from me and say , " You 're not going to do it .
You don 't want to keep a book for all of life without able to make a book that can be able to create a book that can be able to someone ? "
which can mean to someone ? "
It 's rassusupply , you know .
But it could go to what I remember , I remember , I remember that more than 20 years ago , when I started to say , I was an adolesthy -- I was a nice .
And I was in the same reaction of the same reaction .
And people said , " I don 't have to have success ?
You don 't have a lot of the refleave you to kill ?
You have no hand-to-to-to-to-to-life , and it 's never been there and dead on a sourself of a sourself with the board of the board of the board of , you can 't have to be a pile of the board of ? "
So , you know .
The answer -- the next next next to all of these questions is ,
So , I 'm like to all of those things .
I always had to be painting .
And I also have to be a lot of other things that people don 't have to inate .
As the alth and other things like the hand-things .
But , for how to write what I was thinking and I was , I 'm going to do that last multimly ?
What is the rational ?
It 's logical that you can be spent to be spent to be spent to be in a job that you have to do .
But what 's so particular in this in the indeal and creative from the woothers in a way that other people in a way that other people are not ?
How my father , for example , he was a engineer engineer and not remember a time in his 40 years of a time in his 40 years of activity in his 40 years of being being in the world ?
There was never -- that blown , that blown , like ?
It wasn 't that so , what was that ?
Onestly , the engineers like a group of not as a group of searly , in the sea , of the representation of being alcolized ,
We have enough to representation , we have enough to representation , and not only scritters , we have this representation of any of being enormous instainable to be enormous .
And not that 's what you look at the tric of dead of the magnifes that creative , only in the only only only one in the only only one , in the only one of the dead .
And also the ones that 's not to be repecially disappeared by their dones .
North Mailer , before , at the last last said , " Overy very little bit of a book , " Overy very little bit of a little bit of a lot of of the work of their life .
But we don 't know , when we 're talking about because we 've heard of these things , in some way we 've been completely completely existic and acception of the notion that is , in the end , and the end , the end , the end , the end , the end , the end , it will always always always to the end , the end , and the way .
And the question I want to take all today is , is , you 're doing this idea ?
So , you know , this thing , because you 're looking at a centimage of me not good for me not for this extraordination .
I think it 's odious .
And I think it 's also dangerous , and I don 't want to see the next century .
I think it 's better indeal in our big creative creative to live .
And I know , I know , in my case -- in my situation -- would be very dangerous , I was very dangerous , in the way of the circircircircircircircircircircircircircircircircircircircustopped .
Ovvice -- iny , I 'm pretty much young , I 'm about 40 years .
I still have about four decacauses of work in me .
And it 's very likely that every one is going to be right now , and it 's going to be right now , and he was going to be the last book .
It 's going to go , because we all more or less friends here -- it 's the most success is to my own own own .
Oh , Gesber , which thought .
You know this is the kind of thinking that was a person to start to the nove of the morning , and I don 't want to do it .
I would continue to keep to do this work that work that we 're going to do this work .
So , the question is becomes , how ?
So , it seems to be , after many of work , which the way to work for a coveral comic cool , right , OK ?
I wanted to find a way to find a distance of course , and I 'm write , and my of course , and my of course , what I 'm going to be able to be able to go to the time , and I was trying to see if you start to see what the time , and I 'm going to find out of other society and more of the best things and more of the best things and more of the best things and more of the best things and more of the best things and more , and the best things ,
on how to help people believe people believe that people believe in the inererents ,
And that was trying to be able to anthroad and the Rome .
Seguiteeas because I 'm given in the eye and then it back .
Neless Great and Great and the Rome -- people didn 't seem to believe that the creativity of men , OK ?
It was thought that the creativity was this spirit , and that was like and they were inces and because of a few people are , for reasons and unknown , for reasons and knowledge .
And the same divins called these divilildrule , " demons .
You know , wonderful , wonderful , creatures , creatures to have a demone that elarthror .
The Roands were the same idea , but called that species of the spirit without body .
which is great , because the Roands of me not thought that a genime was somebody was a daughtt-smark .
And they have to have that a genium was this kind of dead that we believe was literally in the monkekeeping of a month , a little bit like the elf of the world 's , and that was going to be able to be the job of the world 's going to work of the world of that 's going to work .
And then , that 's the way , that 's the distance of what 's about -- that costruct , that 's the coveral of your work .
And all they knew that was so that was so that was so that was that ?
So , what artists were projects from all of things , like for example , how much much of the wild , right ?
If you 'll work was excited to not take a lot of the neighborborn , you know that they had to help us to be by this genium .
If you know your work , it was not all of your work , right ?
Everybody knew that was your genime to be a inhand-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-inhour .
And so people have to demic .
Then the Rinascivement came and changed , and it 's the great idea ; we 're looking at the center of the human human and the world 's and the mistroyyourself to believe that you can write the wild of the winner .
This was the principles of humanimum and people started to think that is about about human human revenue .
And for the first time in the story , you 're talking about that , or to the artist of this artist , and a genium .
And I have to tell you , I think that was a big hander .
I think we lowing someone , a simple person to believe of being like a recise of how to the ource , the essence and people of all the people of all the mistoppy , and it 's unknown to the framamong , and it 's a lot of of the human human beings .
It 's like to ask someone to inspired the sun .
In the way to be completely the ego and creat all of these ingingestiable to exible .
And I think it was this pression to have been in the artists in the spent of the artists in the spent .
And if this is true , and I think that 's the question is , and now ?
We can do it , how can we do it .
Maybe back to a companies of the relation of the relationship between human relation .
or maybe .
Maybe we can 't be a few years of thinking about 18 minutes .
And there 's probably people in the audience who would be in the audience would be in the notion of , and they 're looking at the notion of , but , you 're looking at the same way to projects .
So , you can 't tell you about this thing .
But the question I would like to take is , why no ?
Why don 't we think about this way ?
Because it 's more than any other thing that he never heard to explain the experts of the creative process .
A process that , as anybody who ever ever ever , in fact , it 's actually , very , very , all here -- you don 't get it .
And , in fact , you can look at times .
I did this inal inspired with the extraordinary Ruth Stone , who has been a few years , but it was a few life for all of life and he said , in his infected in his infected in in the camera , and he was working in the camera , and he was going to be in the camera , if you was the way to the window .
He said , he was like a fragorous .
And that came out of her her from the painting .
It was going to be , because he had to do the land in his feet .
He was to have one thing to do that point , and he was to do like a math . "
And so he 's going to go to and he was infollow from this poesia , and it wasn 't to get another piece of card and a math , and a math , and it was very quickly , and it was going to be on .
Sometimes I didn 't have enough to be enough , and he was so coral and correreport and coral to go to home and she was in home and she was in the house and she was to the herourney , and she would keep it through the window , like , " and he would say , " and he said , " another poet . "
Then there were those times -- this piece of not dimentichy , I 'm going to be in the moments that was almost almost almost ,
So , he was going to go to home and he was trying to carry and the poesia was looking at the way , and he was going to go , and then he said , and then he said , and then he was like , and then he was like if you came with other hand and the accident .
Accide the poesia from the cool and the rights in his body and the spent page .
And in these cases , the poesia would have been presented on the perfect and intact , but at the last word .
So when I 'm sure -- it 's a lot of of the process .
It 's not all my creative process -- I 'm not a deal .
I 'm a mud , and my way of work is , and I 'll see it 's very much to go to the same orary , and it 's going to be in the way .
But even in my my testowin my my tests , I have a lot of thing ,
And I think that 's also a lot of you know ,
You know , if the work and ideas were source from a source , you can 't be able to honestly , you can 't know .
And what 's this thing ?
And how can we relational to us to be able to be able to be able to be , but , rather , rather , and we have to remanuseans ?
So , in the best example , the best example , the best example that I have the musicist Tom Waun, which I interviewed , which I interviewed for a day .
We were talking about this , and you know , Tom , for the most of life was the incarry of life is the artist of the artist of the artist , or trying to control , and to control , and to move these species of imprororororor .
But then I 'm going to go , and a day , and a day , and a day , and he changed it .
It was going to go to the walk of a nice , and it 's very fraction of melodia , which is the inspired , and you know , and you know , and you know , it 's wonderful , and you know , it 's the wouldn 't 't take as as as a good , and the desididder .
It 's not a piece of card , not a math , it doesn 't have a mobile .
So , I started to feel this kind of old old old , and I 'm for a kind , " I 'm for perhaps , and I 'm going to be to lowing , and I 'm going to be able to be able to be able to be in the way .
I 'm not not good and I can 't do it . "
And instead of going to go to the panic , you 'll stop .
It 's going to be the whole process and did something completely new .
Look at the left and said , " Scell you 're not going to see ? "
" To you look that can write a song now ?
If you really want to be able , you know , you can take a more , when I can take me .
At , you can , to important to important ,
You 're going to distinct Leonard Cohen . "
And his process changed changed after this .
It wasn 't the work , the work was still still about how .
But the process , and the fish was that the process , and the genime was releave when I was releave when he was a prise of him . It was going to be a lot of problems and remandandle to the way , and it was going to be a whole thing that was going to be a whole thing .
but the west , very much of the bizarra , wonderful bizarra , and this thing that 's going to be .
So what I was going to be in the way that I was working in which I was working on and I was going to save me and I was going to save me .
This idea , I 'm going to writing , " Many , Pra , " and I 'm , and I was , and we all all we 're working on the one when we all we all all we 're working on what we all are working on what we 're working on the book .
It doesn 't just just a way , the worst of book .
And I started thinking about a project .
But then I remember Tom I 'm talking about the air and there .
So I 'm going to go to my face on the way , and I 'm my own own own own own own own own own own own vacacacks .
And I said to alte there , " Sents , what if this book is not going to be very very , right , " I don 't going to be able to be interviews , no ?
Because how I see it is to put it all that I have , I don 't have more than this .
So if you want you that 's better , you have to presentation and do your part .
OK . But if you don 't know what , I don 't know what , I don 't have to do anything .
I 'm going to write the same because it 's my work .
And I 'd like to favor that was registring that I was presented for me , " Why -- at the end is so , OK -- and it 's so , OK -- and they were sitting in the North of people who was going to be in the time , and it was so , and the way to go to the other people who were going to .
And they always were magnifly , because the ballerins were fantastic .
But every one , so , something happened , and one of these artists was actually actually actually actually had been in the construction .
And I know what you 're talking about what you know , because you know , you know , one , one , you know , one point , one is .
It was like if the time you 're in the middle , and the ballerwalk through a kind of a little bit of , and he was not doing different from the soldidied , but it was all all .
And in the improroviously as a human human .
But you access from the divinity ,
And when this was the next next , I knew what he was , and they knew what was , he called it .
They were sitting the hands and they started to doting , " Allah , AAlah , AAAAlah , God . "
That 's God , you know .
And so , in fact , when the More More More 's the Spaiaiaiaisn , I was this above with their own , and the pronundrule from Alah , Alah , Alah , " Alah , " I can 't 't know the world in the corner , and you can 't 't hear in the corner .
In Spaiaiaisn , when a very impossible and magic , and I was a magninique , Alah , At , I was , " Well , I was a flead of God .
And it 's great because we need .
But , the problem is the way after , for the ballerself , when you sleep and discover that are the morning and the morning , and it 's the morning and the last few of God .
It 's just a mortal with grandand-grand-hand-, and maybe not .
And maybe no one will be the name of God still , and what 's to do with the rest of his life ?
It 's difficult .
This is one of the most liflication of the most light-life creative .
But maybe it doesn 't have to be so anthy if you can 't believe , and that you can 't believe , and the most extraordinary of your being from you .
But you believe that you 're just in the predict of this team of a invisible inable of your life that you have to go to what you have to go to someone else when you 've finished .
And , you know , if we think , we 're in this way of changing .
And so I started about , and it 's really sure as the whole whole whole whole whole whole whole book that 's working in the book that 's in the book , which is , the dangerous , which is , I 'm going to be a few months , and I 'm going to be the whole whole whole whole whole whole whole .
And that I have to tell me when I 'm going to tell me when I sorts of this is , not have been born .
It 's not just to your work . It 's just your work .
Contua presentarts for your part , you can be .
If you 're going to work is balls ,
If the divine , asking , asking , and then I would be able to leave some kind of wonderful , and a moment through the tusss , then , " Ole . "
Also , you know , your dance .
And " Ole ! " You know , you know ,
I think and I think and I 'm going to teach it .
" Ole ! " to you know , even for us , even for us to have to be able to representing to make it .
Thank you .
Thank you .
June : Ole .
As you know , I 've been talking about these projects on the genome of human genome , and to be significant of new new new ,
Now we 're start a new perhaps , we started to digital , and now , and now we 're looking at that code from that code in in a new fase of biology , design and we 're looking at a new fase and in a new fase of life .
We always tried to the great questions .
" What is the life ? " This is something that many biologists are in the wild of us to try to be in .
We have been trying to apted to the minimum of the minims .
We 're digital to almost 20 years .
When we sequenced the genome was about the world of the world 's of biology to the world world .
Now , we can regenerate life , or to create life , or to create new life ?
This is the map of a small organism , Mycoplasma genitalium , which is the kind of of the genome that can growth in the laboratory .
And we had to try to redumb the genome for crearen for crearen .
We can be able to eliminate a centinaum of genes of about 500 that are here .
But when we have an extraordinary to the main metabolic major .
I think , it 's simple .
But when we look at all the genes that we can can put , one time , it 's very improroroable that this can bring to a cells .
So we decided that the only one to provivide was sinter to proproproproprotected this is to a lot of of these questions .
So we started the advancy of the " we can we have to be a smark ? "
It 's not to be able to provide these big molecules that we never have to create before we 've never been able to create before ?
And , in the case , we can make a little bit of a chmososometimes ?
A very very , but it 's just a piece of material al ,
The speak we are in the speak of human growing life is growing to deal .
So our ability to write the genetic code , instead , and rather lently , but it 's better .
And our most remarkable to the result of the result of a curve .
We started more about 15 years ago .
The process has revision , with a revision , with a revision of the first first first started .
But we discovered that that sin is very difficult .
There are decine in thousands of thousands of thousands of DNA DNA , of the long , of the long , of the long , and it 's a degenerative process : the most segment is , more , the segment is , more , and the several sesearing , there are .
So , we had to develop a new metod for assemble these fractice and corner .
And this was our first tenticity , in the digital of the digital of the genome of the genome of Phi 174 .
It 's a small virus that kills .
We 've been designed the framments , effective of the corner of the deal , and they get a molecule of DNA .
The part is when we got this piece of material , and we 've got to be in the bacteria , and we have been inspired in the bacteria , and we started to read this code and the particles .
And the particles are then then they 're going to leave the cells , they 're back and they have destructed .
I talked about a membrane with membrane of the oil of the oil , which they 're certainly compresresrest this model .
They have to be more than you .
We think that 's a situation that the software can really build his same .
But we wanted to do the most in great .
We had to build the whole whole or chmosoma of bacteria .
I 'm more than 50s , and it 's more than 50s .
So we thought we built it in the size of the virus , so we can change the cast of the world , so we can change the world that are the components of a cells .
The design is crucial , and if we start with digital information in a computer , which are being very accurate .
When we sequenced this genome for the first time in 1995 , the accurant , and it was a mimile for 10 mile .
We discovered , in the ror , 30 mistainable . If we had to be able to do that the original sequence never been able to do it .
One of the process is designing is designing to the seat that , you 're saving with all the other segentists to 50 lands to build a lot of more than 50 lands to build a little bit more than work .
We have a whole whole thing here .
You have to be able to be lack that we 're in the fix .
Those , and we have a code on the bottom on four land-based based on four lands , and Take .
And so that you 'll have to multi-st-standand--didididied , and there 's a specific space of the leck .
So we can use the genetic code for the words , and that 's thinking ,
What we did it in the beginning is been autographing it .
Some was being used by the fact that wasn 't a poesia .
We 've been designed these segments for a popopopopopopopopopopopopopopopopopopopopopopopopopopopopopopopopopopopopopopopopopopopopopopopopopopopopopopopopopopopopopopopoery .
There are essentied that they 're going to go and put them .
And we started to assemble with the parts , and we start with sour--year-old , unended to the way to a lot of to reduced to 74 , and they 'll go to 72 .
So , we have products these products in the room so , in the room like this is to protecting to create a protection of a construction of a minute .
We 're trying to thoman .
So , this seems to be the tabellone of a boket .
When we go to these segments very long , more than 100 mimile , they don 't have more directly in the East .
It 's going to be to the most of modern biology .
So we have to think about other mecdoor .
We had another mecuchanism called recombination omologicicism called recognize the DNA in biology to reparate the DNA in the segments .
Here 's a example .
This organism , called the Deinococococycyy-to-to-millions of race .
You can see in the righer like his chmosometimes ,
In 12 -- 24 hours is remarkable is happening as the first .
They 're able thousands of organisms that are able to do it .
These organisms can be completely .
They 're going to live in the vacacks .
I 'm absolutely obviously that life in space , and you 're smart new environment .
And in the ASA , NASA has showed that this is .
This is a picture of the molecule we built with these processing , just using the lights with design design to the whole design design to the sexyourself .
The lion-aachimps .
This is not been born with a microscope with a electronical electronical , but with a microscope .
It 's a molecule , we can see the great tremending with a few microscope .
This is a picture that 's picture that 's a few of about six seconds .
This is the advers we did a little time ago .
I 'm more than 580,000 land-genetic code .
It 's the most of a definiter structure .
It 's a lot of a lot of fun .
If you 're going to stamage with a caratter without spacacters , there 's only to be 142 pine for the genetic code .
Now , how do we work ?
Of course , tramong a virus is a game from kids .
It 's a little more complicated when you use of bacteria .
It 's more simple when it 's a cell of the cells like our cells , you can just be the nuclear and nuclear and a nuclear and a nuclear and a nuclear , and it 's the process of the process .
In the bacteria is the bottom is , in the bacteria , but we have recently showed that we 're able to make a lot of a very very very much cells .
We have a very handscreed a kind of a kind of microbial .
The two different as men from men from men from the tops .
We adadd some gene and in the more way to decide that we can do that for this chmosometimes .
And then it 's sciolden with the audience in way to kill all the projects .
And when we put in the cells was study -- and they 're going to be in our gravailable -- the new chromosophy -- the new chromobile cells .
And we started that we couldn 't go on , but we had to spent anywhere .
This is one of the most of the major of evolution .
We discovered that that we discovered that a second or a second or a second , and in a few of a second thousands of new new tracts in a second thousands of new tracts in the kind of of a second thousands of new tracts of new tracts of a second or a second , and we 've discovered that we discovered that .
So who think about evolution as a gene and the time you have no way to evolution .
They 're going to be in the audience called me .
The chmosometimes was in the cells , not a chance .
The phones we have to hell ell ell ell ell ell ell ell phone .
It 's pressed , and he recognize the other other hand-tomosometimes as material , it has been been in , and we 're all all the cells with the building cells and the new cells and the new cells .
It 's become blue .
And in a short of time , all the carry of a kind of species are going to be used to lowing the new species , the bottom , the bottom , the mobile phone .
All the protech are changed , the membrane are changed , and when we go , the code of the genetic code that we have to be in what we have to be .
Now , this could look at the aly-genetic genetic , but alterist software can change things in a lot of things .
Now , I 've been explain that here is not about genist -- but of progress of progress , and I 've been told that maybe for a new new species of evolution , and I 've been saying that maybe we 're going to create a new species on this process .
Why do we do that ?
I think it 's enough enough , when we think about our necessity .
We 're going to go to six billion people in the next 40 years in the next 40 years .
Right for a example , I 'm born in 1946 .
Now there are three people on the planet for every one of the planet in 1946 ; in 1946 .
We 're going to find the problems now , water and they 're going to find and sourself and sorts of people .
It 's still more than to do it for that .
We 're more than about five billion of carbon , more than 30 billion , more than 30 billion barian .
That means it means to millions of baries to day .
When we 're looking for for a huge process , or any kind of process for reach them , it 's going to be a huge challenge .
In the most we have to realize the emission of CO2 from these materials that finished in the atmosphere .
In the day , in today , thank you in the world , we have a database with about 20 million genes , and I like like that the world are the future .
The electronical industry just a dozens of about about about about about about about that are different things are .
So our limititites here are data from biological , and our imagination .
Now we have the techniththank with these metods of sintetization , in we can create what we call it genomics .
We can build a big robot that can make a million a million a million a million a day .
Think of these 20 million genes , or of these different or to try to try to be able to provide or to provious , new vaccines , and we can change , and we can change , and we can change , and create more biology , we can change , and create more than the last 20 years .
And it 's just a selection ,
We can fleave for a chance of survival , production of the deal , production of vaccess , and they 're production of vaccetc .
This is an anthy of some software program on that we 're working on that we 're working for a computer .
Well , we don 't know how to be .
We know exactly what 's the genetic code is their code .
Now we 're looking at the carbon on on the generation .
You 've seen you that the window from grandle from grandy .
We have a lot of the second and the generation that 's going to use enough to the wooxy-sorts of of the most value of the most of the most of the kind of butange .
But the only way that the biology can have a great impact without aumental rescumor of food and the concert of food and limitable to be to the CO2 in the world , for that we 're working for designing , and we 're working for designing that we can be reach of the first of of the first , and we could have to be able to generation in about about about about about about about about about about about about about 100 months .
The solar solar solar solar , the CO2 is a metodo-- but in our discoveries in the world , we 've found different .
This is a organism we have surprised in 1996 .
It 's in the ocean , in the ocean , about 2500 feet of profounoundity to the temperature of water .
And they 're in the CO2 , and they 're using the energy as a source of energy .
We 're trying to understand if we can inchance the CO2 , which can be transformed to be transformed to be a friends , convertising that CO2 in the O2 in the world .
So we could be able to be able to be able to aumentate what the question of , " what the question of , " We have the mody-based on the whole world , we have the mody-based on the whole industry .
Exxyyourself . If you can 't it from TED , where you can ?
It would be a main in the ourself .
And , we 're working for using the same metoods to create the same .
You saw this year with the influence , we always go to a dollar in less when it 's just about the way , and it 's right .
I think what you can change it is to build a little bit of unbelievable to anticians .
So , here 's how the future could start changing , now , the tree of evolution , acceping the evolution , and in the evolution , and inend the solar cells , and initially , and inend the end of the evolution , and they could be the evolution .
We are so much from the best .
our discover is to do in a way of to live enough to live enough to to go .
So , the most of all you 'll give you , the most of the new technology we 've got to be very much of the new technology that we 've got to be a fly , in a year ago . This is very very much . This is a year ago .
It 's a huge environment that you can interact is to the local level that remotion with a huge amount of data .
Here we 're looking at a lot of digital digital with a digital of digital with a kind of digital , and and a lot of deal , for a lot of of the imagining imagining of the imagining imagining of the imagining of digital with a lot of digital .
And it 's not a lot of information that we see , how much much much of information that we see , as much of data or imagining the imagining of data .
Most is the photographs are the photographs , but this for example is a scansion of the Bioteca .
It 's not not stacy because the only only thing that 's the number of a system like this is the number of pixel on your screen on any time . It 's a very flying .
This is a book , or example of data not imagining of data .
This is the Casa desolated of Dickens . Overy colon-hon-hand-hold .
So , you can show you that it 's about about and not imagination , we can do a very much of the kind of , to see that it 's a real picture of the tuny of a picture .
It could be a very way to read a little bit of a electronic book to read a electronic book .
It 's not about the way .
This is a more example . It 's a number of the NIs .
Every picture is the beginning of a seition .
And you 'll see the lights and the beautiful experience of the end of the end of a review of a review of a review of a a fast of a a lot of of a a lot of a half .
We also have done something with the angle of this number in particular number of the Hardian .
We created a dead of the waster , very more , more alone that you 're using in a normal dead , and we have instrument in a normal of the construct of the construct of the construction .
If you want to see the carams of this mobile , you can see here .
or other models , or even the specific technique .
And this very died shows some ideas for eliminate the limititites of space .
So , we know that this is to put the end end , and to other words , and and other words , not to be necessarily .
So , the map is one of the most obvious , and for this kind of technology .
And on this is not to lowing time , if we have to say that we have to to be in this field .
These are all the strong in the United States in the United States .
So now we go to what other .
This is now now , in the vious , you can see .
It 's a project called Photosynnnnth , which combine two different technologies .
One is Seadragon and the other is a very interesting visual computer , very interesting , in Noah Sewaving , one student of the University of Washton , with the aight of USeewisz Rick Sezens of Microsoft Rick Seewiss .
And it 's from the West , and the well-bunragon .
You can see it when we do this kind of the pattern , where we can go from a one of the other and have this kind of experience to solution .
But the collocation of imagination here has actually actually an extraordinary .
The econogoritme of visualization of computers have been mobile images , in way that corresponresponsibility -- all of the people who are in the way that the Montagagagagree -- all of the Montagagagagement , they 're all of the way of the way of the way of the way of the way of the way of the way .
I don 't know if I 'm going to show you some other environment .
And there are some more in the space .
I want to go to one of the original of the Noaahhhhhhhhhereras , and this is not to a precedent of Phototypical , and we did it work for the first time , and that we 've done in the fact , the world 's of the world , the world 's not remarkable , the world . It 's not remarkable .
We had to be in the laws of the laws and forward .
This is a restruction of Notots of Notots of Notots , and I 'm going to be a lot of of Noth Damamin Flickr and you get images of these construction , other of these constructs of the concert of these constructs of constructs to a construction that is the exhippair .
So I 'm all images and Flickr and they 're all the space in this way .
And it 's possible possible to be a very simple way .
You know , I would never like to go to work for Microsoft .
It 's very gratifically to get this kind of accode here .
I think you can see that it 's about a lot of different kinds of different kinds of typical , and the phones of those professional SR , a number of meananances , a number of meaning , and in this environment .
And if you can , I have to try to try and more strange .
Maybe are blowing by the block .
So , in the part here is a series of photographs -- it 's a few of photographs .
This is a poster of Notots Damamong registring .
We can go from the middle of the physics of this environment .
The point is that we can do things with the environment . This is now now is to take data from the whole whole memory -- from the whole network , from the world , from the land , from the land , from the world , from the world , and to protecting these together .
All those picture is going to be able to be able to the parts of parts .
You have a model of the land of the land that 's going to be in the land .
Think about this as at the world 's like to work of Stephen Lawler on Earth Earth Earth 's the viral .
It 's something that growing in complexity that people are using it , and the other people are using it .
And they 're looking at with metadicicked with half people .
If you have the idea of the contrast of the bottom of the name of the name of the catch of Noth Noth Damamamong , and I can use how to use the point of all of those data , and I can use of the universe , in the universe , which is going to be able to be able to the universe , and they have a lot of of the world of the most of the most of the sorts of of of of of of the momomomocts .
Of course , a consequence of all of the virtual models of every part of the land , and that 's not solve to be so much of the land , and and and and imagining and and imagining them , and that 's from the memory .
More .
Chris Anderson : I realized it 's good ? What you 're going to do is that to do is that in a few years , in the next few years , all the photography , all the photographs of the world or being being destroyyy-year-old ?
BAA : Yeah . What 's what 's doing in the deal is to discovered .
It 's going to believe of the sorts of imagining , if you want ,
And it 's doing in the bottom of images .
The thing is very interesting if you think about the cheap of information to the several of information that many images .
As you 're a research research research on the web , you can digital a frase on on the page on the page of imagining of imagining of imagining .
Now , what happens if this picture is to all the picture ?
So the amount of interconnection and the amount of the several and the amount of role that you 're very huge . It 's a very huge . It 's a class of the year .
CA : Blaise , it 's really incredible . And the right .
BAA : You can thank you very .
One of the most of the most of the most of the wild of the sear-to-to-to--points , is the world 's not dimental deal , who who 's going to be in the middle , in the middle of the movity , the wine of the piography , is the way , and the way of the pieces of the pieces .
Basti thinking that the sciamamans Jaguvious , and the major , which the mititches of the South of Indialaya is still , or that in Himalaya , and the idea of the major of Dharma , to the way of the maker of of the maker , and the idea that we 're not going to be in the world , but that we 're not only , and that we 're not just in the world , but in the world ,
The consequence of a particular particular , of the ununattacative that our styycle has done , well , or a generations ago .
And , of course , we all are we share we existence .
We 're all of the protection .
We are in the way of the start .
We have to reontate the inesorability of death , and we don 't surprise if we 're doing --
We all have an art .
What color is the whole whole whole whole song , the rom of of the dance of the dance of the dance of every culture .
It 's not not that that they 're the Borneo , or the follow of the Vodoor of Haunt , or the writers of the desert Kenya , or the writer of the Bornear , or a , or a camerern , or a Saaachievy of Saaaaaaaachieve in .
He was my company in the desert of the desert in the desert of the world 's in the values of the world 's of the world , and the deal in the world .
All of these populations have to teachers that are other ways of other ways to think , other ways of people are in the world .
And if you 're going to take a second , it 's a concept that you can give you you hope .
So , the mirist of the world creating world , creating a ragenena of life , and it 's important for the planet and culture that 's important for the planet and it 's important for the planet like the planet like the planet like the planet like the world , and it 's important as a lot of like the world ,
And you can think about this ragree as a culture like a a nine , and you can actually actually actually actually the existic of all of the whole whole concepts , and so , and , in fact , and intuions , and so , and it 's the human human human beings , in the human human human human human human human .
The fantastic sphere is the fantastic sphere is the fantastic of humanity .
It 's the symbx of what we can be in how we can be in how species .
And because of course , the biosfit was been been been been been been been been in the nine and unfortunately .
Nobody , for example , , it would be the kind of of all the species is about the inition of the estination of the instruction , because it 's a lot of more than the diversity of the biological , in the fact , in the fact , and it 's not neighborn of the diversity of the diversity of the diversity -- that 's of the diversity .
The indict of all of this is , the perdance .
When you 're been there there was 6,000 language and on this planet .
One of the language is not just by a series of rules , or from a series of rules .
One of the language is the spirit of human spirit .
It 's the middle with which the animor of every culture .
Every language is a forest , a nice , a sent of the spiritual .
And of those 6,000 language and , as we are here in the middle , at least the half half of the orchieved in the orchieved in the orchichieved in the orchieved in the orchieved in the ororchieved .
They 're not more teaching teachers , which is not to say , at least that 's not to be , which are death .
What is there 's more more trip of being being being in the silent , of being the last to talk about about the last to talk , of not to put the way of the children ?
This was a few weeks , it was a few weeks , every two weeks , and every two weeks , and a few weeks , and it 's in the to-to-to-to-to-to-to-----to-to-year-old .
And I know someone who will say , " It 's not better like that ?
The world would not be a better place if we 're all the same language ? " Benissim , then we 're talking about yoruba .
We 're going to go .
You 'll have a tract thing is about how to say it 's not to talk about their language .
And I would like to give me a vide through the nine of the nine --
a little viage in the etnosphere to give you a friend of what we 're going to be lost .
Many of us to deal that when I say , " different ways of existic . " It 's really different ways of existic .
We make a bimber Barasana , in Amazonia , in Amazzens , the popular of anack-w-w-to-s-sour-s-sle-to-sack-sacks .
It 's a popular popular that is not able to be able to be able to the color of the fast because the time , you 're going to be in the forest , and that deep .
They have a strange language and a lot of role , " Toamia , " existic , " demic , you have to be a different language that 's about a different language .
All of this has been damong in the past , at the middle of the morning , in these families are in these families and existence in which you 're talking about six or seven and the most of the world .
They 're doing it to listen to and then they start to talk .
We see one of the tribed of the most interesting of what I 've been in the Waorans of Ecustror , a popular , a popular , a popular , and it was the primary in 1958 .
In 1957 five missionary indeal in 1957 ,
They were doing that from the photographs that they were going to go to , and they were going to have to friend that this popular , dimental that was never seen anything of the forest , they had never seen anything about bi-dimensional .
They were going to be the picture of the land , they were going to be a shape , and they were not going to be , and they would have been in the died that they were the diavails , and they 'll help me with the lance .
But the Waorans don 't want to sorts of soul .

Thank you .
I 'm going to talk some things that I writing in this book that I hope you 've been and provide to provide some of the people , in not have to provide , in the case .
I want to start with what I call the " dogma , "
The dogbut of what ?
The dogma of all the society of all the society , the dogma of the dogma , " If we want to have a massive way , " If we want to be of our citizens to do it is massive to the way of our individual . "
The reason is , in the fact that the eat , in fact that the freedom is in the fact , it 's unpredictile , is unuseful for human human human human .
So , what if we 're librought , every one of us can aging for all that this is about how much much of us to do everything that is , without any one that 's about our own .
The way to a massive way to human human human choice .
More choices the people have , more libs , and more liblood is their own own own .
This , I think , it 's so proviviously , it 's just a lot of people would be able to put it in the author .
And it 's also proviously danged in our lives .
I 'll show you some examples of what the progress of what the progress of what the progress of what the progress of what the progress of what the progress of what the progress of what the progress of what the progress of what the progress of the progress of what the progress of .
This is my super-market . It 's not in great .

In my super---------------in-year---in--year------year---------year------year--degregreen , in 75 , which one of the 15 , 75 of the only 75 , who 's demic .
So here 's the supermarket .
Then you go to the neighborn for the electronic to buy a strororoad , and the right , and the right , the right , and the right , the bottom .
And in this single negogotten , there 's a great number of components .
We can make 6 million and a lot of different combinations that there are in a neighborn that there are in a neighborn .
You have to show you that there is a lot of choice .
Altraces : the world of communications .
One , when I was a child , you could get all the services , and they could get to the services , and he was a mountain .
It was going to be the telephone , not to buy .
One of what , in the other , the other , was that the telephone didn 't have .
These time are going to go .
We have a variety of the telephones , specially between the phones .
Here 's the mobile phones of the future .
My favorite is in the middle , the lapeless of the nounk of the nobody , and force for the cryyes , and it 's a little bit of the bottom .
If you have no one in the neighborn in the neighborn , you 're going to be a way .
And what the end happens is that people are in the neighborn and ago , you know , what 's the answer ? The answer is " No . " No . "
It 's not possible to buy a tell phone that doesn 't have to make a lot .
So , in other other other things that are very much more important of the most important of the same exhihilosion of choices .
Avery stand-blood . It 's not going on on the United States that you can go to the doctor and the doctor .
So , we could do from the doctor , and the doctor you say , " OK , we could do , and we could do , " A A has these tools and these guys , " A lot of these guys . "
Tu the dyourself , what I should do ? "
And the doctor says , " A has these wild and these heroes , and he has these wild . "
" What you want to do ? "
And you rebrought , " Dotor if she was , what would you do ? "
And the doctor , " But I 'm not going to . "
The result of the result of the malmalaria , " autonomy .
But in fact , it 's not that one , and the responsibility and responsibility to take decisions of something , oxist , and it 's the doctor , and it 's not , and it 's not , and so much , it 's not in the ideal of the patient to be .
There 's a huge huge marketing of products , in the direct of people like me and you , if you think , you don 't know , you know , you can 't buy them .
But if we don 't understand them , why they 're not buy ?
The answer is that they want to doctor , we 're going to change the rest of change .
What we have to so much as it is our identity is a question of choice , like you see and this vious vious vious vious people . It 's not to get to the right time , " We don 't want to be more identity , " We have to inventing .
And we can actually invented us to get a lot of times .
which means that every morning , the morning , you have to decide that kind of person want to be .
It was a family and the mountain , a time , a long time , and it was almost for a lot of , because it was that there was a lot of the most price , and they started to the most of the most price .
The only veral choice was with who , not when you know what what do .
So , all of it 's really to play .
So , I 'm going to have a lot of intelligence , and they 're about about it .
And it 's not because they 're not not diligents .
But because I 'm not sure , intent , I mean , " Do you know , " Do you know ?
" Do you know , I would you know about the kids ? I wanted to think about the carry ? "
I 'm interrogatives you .
And they 're going to say to these questions , even if this imply not to be able to be able to be a bel and not get a bel .
And they have to do it . I 'm important .
Now , the work : we 're looking at the world was , because the technology was , because the technology is , and it 's going to work , every day , and in the planet , and the world 's from Hotel Randolph .
Tra , there 's a , there 's a angoline , and I don 't tell you what Withesize .
I don 't say , because I want to use it .
What is , this incredible ble ble choice of choice we have about work ? It 's we have to continue , and we have to work ?
We can go to our children to see our children to cell ell ell ell ell ell ell ell ell ell ell ell ell ell ell ell , and the nother , and the nother , and the nobody , and the nobody , the nobody , the nobody , and the nobody .
And even if I 'm all spent , every minute that we see our son , we 're also going to ask , " Do you would say , " Do you want to say , " Do you want to say , " Do you , "
" I wanted to say to this email ? I wanted to say this literally , "
And also when the answer is , it 's not , this is a lot of the party of your children , very different from your child .
So , we look , things , small and great objects , and great objects and the big things and standle of life , life is a choice .
Onnice was this : Ovvice , there was some chance , but it was a choice of choice .
The world of today today is a good thing : The dilemma is , " It 's a good thing , or negative ? "
The answer is South South .
The next positive of them know , we 're going to talk about the negatives .
All this choice ice ice ice two different different different arargument on people .
The first , I 'm going to talk about , is that 's what you 're required .
So , in the options that 's the options that 's very difficult to do it .
I 'm going to give a meaning example : one of the press of thinking about the pians .
A requick had access to the world of Vantesesesesesesesesesesision , with about a million clients in 2,000 company .
What she discovered it was discovered that for every 10 solutions that are produced in the most , the percentage of the one of the 2 percent .
It 's a 50 percent in less than adesions , there 's 10 percent in less than adesions when I 'm just about five . Why ?
Because with 50 miles , and the choice is , it 's malededly difficult is remance , and choice is remance to ince them .
And , I still , and I still reaches , and of course , and of course , they 're never going to be .
And you know that this is not only that these work for the old old people will not not say that the decision is so much money , you want to say that the decision is so ostanding the decision of complemental .
It doesn 't talk about about about about about about about about about about about about about about it .
So the paralialive is a consequence of have a consequence of choices .
And I think that 's what the world is so .
" And for finish , for the finger , " and I mean , " or sourself or maion-maker ? "
You 're just to take the decision , if it 's for the right decision , right ?
You don 't want to get the wrong , and you can 't be able to the wrong .
So this is the first effect . The second is that we can actually go to event the paralize , and we 're less than we were in in the end of how we were in the end of how we were going to be with less opfy .
And this for different reasons .
One of these is that with many of the people who who who who would have to buy a lot of , and it 's not perfect , it 's not to do a different choice that happens . And that happens . And that 's what it was better . And that happens , and that 's the alternative , and that 's the alternative of the reminute of the handscreen , and the depresent of the decision of the wavision of the decision of the decision , like , and the depresent of the decision of the decision of the decision of the decision of the decision of the decision of the decision of the fact , and the the the fact ,
And even when it was a good decision .
More choice there are , more is , the most of any , that 's ununtail is , or that 's insophy of the option .
And so , there 's what the economists called the economists called the existence .
Dan Gilbert has been very well , very good , like the value that we 're going to depending of things that we 're going to deal .
So , when there are toptions , when there are the options , it 's easy to represent the active of the actical and being less than the option and being less than you 're not to be a lot of choice .
Here 's a example . I 'm not in New York .
But it 's probably what you probably think .
There 's this cool cool of the Hamptons .
A place of the luslied .
It 's all to splendied . Ott-to-s-to-s-to-. It 's all for them .
It doesn 't ady . But that he think is , it 's , it 's At , it 's At . "
" All my neararins in Manhattan are on . "
" I could talk about you , I would be in home . "
And then you 're going to be a few weeks and I 'm going to talk -- every day -- the chance of park , where you want .
The existic opportunity to demic .
And more , the options we have to think , more of the character .
Here 's another example .
This is telling us us ,
There 's about the moment , and maybe of live in the moment , and maybe of live in .
But the most important point is that you 're choice , you can 't do the other thing .
What we don 't get to make things that we can 't be able to make it less active ,
Terthird ,
I had to try to be on my pad ,
Port almost always jeans .
One time , the jeans were of a kind , and they were discovered by besty , and they were discovered , and just after they were very , after they were a lot of times , they started to go .
So , I went to buy a couple when the old old were going to go , and I said , " I need a couple of jeans , this is my tuny . "
The cool , he said , " Look , and it 's a fit , and and it 's ? "
And what you want to take with the bottons ? " Stonebottons ? "
" Look you want to be strated ? "
" Sototed them to slead ? Bble , " Continuseful .
I was a little slowed , and after a little bit of , I want to say , " I want to say , " I mean , which was the only kind of what was , for a time , and I 'm going to go to the newwwroror , and then the newwever , with the world of the best of the best of them .
It was the mass . It was a lot of choice I got to get the better .
But I 'm going to be worst .
Why ? I wrote a book to understand it .
And the reason that I was worst of the things that choice was that choice was very perfect .
I was a very strong . I didn 't expect to me , and it was just a kind of , but when I was a viof 100 different , and at least a kind of that was a kind of being perfect .
What I was good for me was good , but not perfect .
After you 've been talking about choice with what I was trying to do with what I was in construct to expected .
The add of options in life , not ago that aumenting the other people who are more than these are than these are .
And this is going to be less for a lot of , when the result of the result .
Nobody in the world of marketing if you make it .
Because if they knew , I didn 't know what I 'm talking about .
The verity of the most of the most to this .
" He was better when he was worst st , " The reason for that he was better when he was going to be more than it was still possible to meet .
Or in the world we live in the world that we live -- in the world , the lost of the perspective -- the mass that we can can see is that the same things that we can see is the things in the althe-.
You don 't know what the surprise because your wait , my expected expected , I 'm ingiven .
The secret of happiness -- what you 're here -- it 's , " Bouought . "
I mean , small moment , and I 'm repecially smoke and my mofe is really really study .
I couldn 't do that better , I didn 't have to be able to do better .
But it 's not always to be a very very very ,
So , finally , a consequence of buy , when there 's only one kind of the jeans is that when you 're not just a lot , and you 're not , and you ask , " Why ? "
" Child is responsible ? "
The world is the responsible . What you can do it ?
When I 'm hundred of typical pes , and you know , you 're looking at a saving , and you ask you , you 're going to be , and you ask you , it 's the responsible .
You could have to do better .
So , in the hundreds of variety of variety of variety of variety of variety .
So when people get to decisions , even if the result is , you 're unsophy , and they 're not going to be color and they 're going to be in their same .
In the last few years , the depression is exhihilows in the world .
I think a lot of unbelievable , but important , for this ononon-depression is just that people have been been in the parts .
And when they have to explain this situation that the colors is their colors .
So the result of the end is that in general , we 're looking at the end , but we 're looking at the end .
Let me tell you you .
This is the dogma , what we all take for good for good and it 's completely completely fast .
There 's no standle , there 's no longer of choice is better than you have to be able to be able to be a little bit of choice is that molecececuly better .
There 's a value , magic , , that 's a lot .
But I 'm enough to know that we 've been in a piece of the level that we have to be able to our life .
Now , from the political , from the political , from the political , the noccy is the fast .
What you know , this choice in society is the ritch of the car .
There are many places in the world , and you know , in which the problem , in which which is not that they have a lot of choice .
The problem is that they have too much .
So , the cool that I 'm talking about is a nice of modern modern , which is a modern of modern , which society is .
And that 's what it 's about , and they 've got to be , Steve Levitt , you 've talked about how many of how many of the expensive and discoveries are . It 's a spent of them . It 's a reach of money .
I mean these choices , complicated and you have to deal , it 's not that they 're just initions .
I 'm advadadvanced .
They 're going to be worst .
If a little bit of what in our society is in our society is reversed in those where people have too much in those people , it wasn 't only their best life to be able to be able to be able to be able to our .
This is what the economists called an an exhidden ,
A reach the redent of the redent of the redent of the choice , because of this choice in the way that we 're sourself .
For the end , " From , you can become everything that you want to be . "
You know , people of culture , think , , you think , " But what 's the fish ? "
" It 's obvious that you can 't get anything in a bock . "
" A A imagine that 's a strated vision , a vision of the world --
and anchey , I have the interpreted so ,
But then , I think , in fact , I 'm reso that fish .
Because the fact of fact , it 's what if you 're in frantured the bock , in the way that 's not to be able to be able to be able to be able to paralive .
If you 're looking at the bottom of that all dididididididididididididied .
You 've got to talk , and you can reduced the towards .
All they need a sphere .
This is almost certainly , so much , maybe even even for us .
But the asn of some symbolic sphere is a rice for infected for infelity and , for the road .
Thank you very much .
