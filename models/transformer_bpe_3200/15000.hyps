I showed these these slides to show that the glacial calotta glacial , which for almost three million years has had had had the size of 48 million years has had had the size of 48 .
But that subvalue this subvalvaluable , because it doesn 't show that much of the ice .
The arctic covering is , in a sense , the heart of the global climate system .
You expanded up and winds of the summer .
The next slide will be a rapid carrelated to the last 25 years .
The glaces are signed in red .
You see , you 're expanded to the blue wall .
That 's the ice in the winter , which is ritira of summer .
You can see that the cosidamage of the ice ice , of five years or more , is like blood , which is like blood , which is like blood .
In 25 years , it 's past that , at that time .
This is a problem because the heat the ground , the glacier around the ocean in the sea , where there are huge amounts of carbon congle , and they 're transformed in metan microbes .
I 'm going to push the totality of the inatmosphere from global warming , that amount of of global warming , that would be overcome this point of not return .
In some of the laghi , little profound in Alaska metan is already rebolling on the water .
The professor Katey Walter of the University of Alaska a team in a team , at a team , at the last last last last last last last last last last last last last last .
Video : Wow ! Al Gore : I 'm good . I think we 're going to be ,
That 's why this termal exchange Groundaydia from the North .
This is a glacial record .
The brought had never reached it .
This is the Kangerlussuaq , in the west of Groland .
If you want to know how sale the sea level for the sea , of the ice of the sea level of the sea .
These run run out of the current .
The other part of the planet : Antartide , the largest block of ice on the planet .
The month of the scientists have dichieve that the bill of ice is in negative , and that Antarctica , which pogers on some hydropen , which pogers on some hysun , is particularly fast .
It 's about six feet of the account of the activity in Groland .
Sulla Himalaya , the biggest third , the biggest third , you see new laghi , which is a glaciers ,
40 percent of the world population is half of the world 's population half of the water that 's lifetime .
Sulle Ande : this glacier is the fount of water .
The labed has increased .
But when it diminues , the same happens to the water water .
In California , the nenow on Sierra Nevada is diminuity .
The idrices are in crisis .
The predictions , like you have read , are good .
The growth of source in the world leads to a remarkable remarkable .
The environmental disasters are increasing to a ritish outside of the normal and without previous .
Four times more numbers in the last 30 years , I respect 75 .
This is a whole insustainable .
If you look at the historical context if they can see the consequences .
We added 70 million tons of CO2 , and we added 70 million tons of CO2 , 25 million tons in the ocean every day .
Look at the area of the oriental Pacific , from the American American American , to west , and in both both of the indeed in the middle of the indeed of the ocean oxygen in the ocean .
The major cause of global warming , together to deforestation , which is 20 percent , is the use of fossil combustible fuels .
The oil is a problem , and the carbon is even worse .
The United States are one of the two countries with more emissions , together to China .
And it was proposing to build many other central central carbon .
But we 're seeing at a direction of a direction of the direction .
These are the anullated projects in the last few years and some green proposes .
Anyway , there 's a politics in our country .
The carbon industry and oil industry and oil have spent 250 million dollars in last year to promote carbon , which is a byygold .
That image I remember something --
Natal , in Tennessee , where I live , there was a loss of 3.8 billion gallons of carbon didig .
Maybe you saw it on the news .
This is the second largest fllow of last flow in America .
It 's happened around Natal .
The advertisment of one of the carbon industry was this .
Video : I 'm going to do it .
It 's abundying here in America , and it 's growing our economy .
Frosty carbon is more and more and more cleaner .
It 's good price , adorable and the work of the work of them .
Al Gore : The coal is the coal of the West Virginia .
The biggest society mineral minerary society is Massey Coal . This is his administrator .
Video : Don Blakenship : I 'm going to be clear -- Al Gore , Nancy Peloid -- they 're not going to know what are are talking about .
Al Gore : So the Alleance for the Protextion of Clima has launched two campain .
This is a part of it , one part .
Video : Acore : Alla COALergy we see the climate change as a serious serious security to our business .
So , in our priority is investing a big amount of money in a bunch of money in a public public and confused the truth .
In fact , carbon 't that .
We think it 's cleaning -- it 's also a good profum .
So you don 't preoptit of climate change .
Let me do it .
Video : Acore : Carbone , you heard a lot of talk about it .
So let me take a little bit of a structure at the time to the slow coal .
Straordinary ! The machines are a little rumorous , but this is the sound of the fuon the pulit of technology .
The carbon consumption is between the main of global warming , but the remarkable technology , but the remarkable technology of carbon , which you see changes everything .
You look at a look at : this is the odiergn technology .
Al Gore : Inally , the alternative alternational security and the security of national security .
Video : The America is in crime ; the economy , the national economy , the climate crisis .
The file connects all : our dependence from our dependence fuel , like the sporite and oil importantly .
Now , there 's a new , audace , audace solution for using circumstomes .
Repower : 100 percent of energy , in 10 years .
A plan to reput America to work , make sure more sure , and help us stop the global warming .
It 's inally , a solution that bastes to solve our problems .
Repower . You 're not in America .
Al Gore : This is the last last .
Video : How much of it 's return to America .
One of the faster ways of the fast ways to dependence the combustible that kills our planet .
Comparts : The future is here . It 's a whole new energy network .
Comparsa : Negi investment for bucks .
Anyment : Repower . It 's time to be realisted .
Al Gore : A old proverbio African says , " If you want to go fast , you go to fast .
If you want to go away , you 're going to . "
We have to go away , fast quickly .
Thank you very much .
Last year at TED , I 've got a introduction in the LHC .
And I promise to get up to enjoying about how the machine works .
So I 'm here here here . And for those that the other time there were no , LHC is the biggest scientific experiment ever tented -- 27 kilometers of this .
Her task is to return the conditions that were less than a billion than a billion in the beginning of the universe -- until 600 million times a second .
All of that 's just environment .
This is the machine in Ginevra .
We 're doing this little Big Bang in the reflights .
This is what I work . It 's called ATLAS -- is about 44 feet and has a diameteter in 22 feet .
This is a spectacular picture of ATLAS in building so you can see the proportions .
10 settember of the last year we have acceso the machine for the first time .
And this picture was taken from ATLAS .
It was because of immense festeggies in the room of control .
It 's an image of the first of particles that had done all the LHC , entering in collision , with a part of HC , and spread particles in the ravor .
In other words , when we see that image 10 settember , we found that the machine worked , which is a great victory .
I don 't know if it was this to make us more or this , when somebody went on Google and saw that the page was this .
That means we have a cultural impact of the science .
I was a week later , there was a problem with the car , I had to have a problem with the car , I had to sleep .
These fili they 're 13,000 amping practice when the car works in the massive .
Now , the technical technical technical , they 'll be very much of you will look at the end and they 'll say , " It 's too overwhose . "
And they can do it because when they 're very cool cool .
So , at least 271 degrees , at least 271 degrees in the space between the stars , these fili can bring that run .
In one of the junture of the most of the magneti magneti in LHC , there was a defect of fit .
So the fili , and they measurements , and 13,000 practice practice , and they 've got an electrical resistence .
This was the result .
Now , this is more impressive if you think that these magneti fish are more than 20 tons , and that have been moved about 30 centimeters .
They 're founded about 50 magneti .
We had to take them , what we then did .
We 've repressed and traveled .
Now they 're all going to have their own place .
By the end of mart LHC is going to be again integrated .
We 're going to access it , and we expect to get data , and we 're going to go to the end of the data , and we 're going to find out what 's the morons that are the morons that are the morons that are the morning that are the universe .
Now , of course , in a certain way , these accidents return the dibate on the value of science and engineering in front of science and engineering . It 's easy to confliclict .
I think the fact that it 's so difficult , the fact of going to be the value of things like LHC .
I want to end with the words of a English scientist , Humphrey , which , I imagine , in difetime of inuseful experiments of his pupille , his pupille was Michael Faday , he said , " Nijobobs that there are no long-term for progress of human mind how the science of science of the human mind that is about the science of science of the human mind that are not a whole . "
Thank you .
I want to start to ask you to think about when , children , from children , play with the morning .
And as you understand how to reach them and make them , take them and make them , and you learn , learn , you know , actually , and we 're doing it , and we 're going to have a space and confident relationship .
The space reasoning is deeply connected to the way we understand the way we understand a lot of the world around us .
So , from the information usually inspired of our interaction with physical objects , with my consultant Packs , and my collaborator Jeevan Kalanithi , I started asking , " And if we use a computer , instead of having the only cursor of the mouse , we could have the only one of the mouse , we could make sure sure sure sure sure that it 's a computer with both hands , you , we could truly , with both hands , with both hands , and I ,
and how to sistage it to our please ?
The question was so interesting that we decided to explore the answer , we decided to explore the answer , and the Siftable .
In a few words , a Siftable computer is a big interactive computer as a biooday .
In a few words , a Siftable computer is a big interactive computer as a biooday .
You can move with your hand , they can see them , " between them , " You can see their motion and they have a screen and a screen .
But most of them , are physical objects , like the morning , they can move it simply ,
Siftable is a new ecosystem of a new ecosystem to manipulate information .
And as they get more physical , conscious , and as the other , and as they 're going to become more physical , conscious , of how we move them to the other , of how we move them , we can explore new and fun and fun and fun and interaction .
I 'm going to start with some simple example .
This Siftable is configurate to show video : if you 're pushing it in a direction , the video is going to stay on the other side .
These interactive rators are conscious to other people .
If you face them , you 're interested in what 's about their around .
If they 're circumdies , they can do it and they can do a little bit .
If they 're circumdies , they can do it and they can do a little bit .
They also have their own motion and inclination .
We realized that one of the most most implications of the interaction was able to use common dies , to example , " a color like a liquid . "
In this case , we have three Siftable configured as a lot of vernice and I can use them to the color , where you put them .
and I can use them to the color in the central , where you 're miskey .
We 're too too , we can put it a little bit of place .
I 'm also good for apprentice , like the language , like the language , mathematics and games where people can try to try things , and see the result result , and see the immediately result .
Now I 'm --
This is a Fibonacks that I do with a program of equations .
Here we have a words that 's in half of the words that 's in Scarabeo and Boble .
It 's not , at any re-re-re-in-re-in-re-inted letter , at every single turnal turnal , at every Sifable , and as you 're trying to get a letter to a dictionary .
Then , after about 30 seconds of the remissed , and you have a new leck , and you have a new set of reading and new chance .
Thank you .
Here 's the children came to the gitedia Lab , I did it so that I tried them and I went a video .
They 're very liked .
And one of the interesting things that we have to be a lot of application is that you don 't have to give people many education .
You have just say , " Compons of words , and they 'll know exactly what to do .
Here 's how many people who are trying to do it .
This is our beta younger tester than there on the right .
It was actually wanted to impilling them .
They 're only morning , for him .
Now , this is a application of a interactive cartoon .
We wanted to build a tool for the apprentice of language Lui is Felix .
It can put new characters in the scene , which is solving the Siftable .
It can put new characters in the scene , which is solving the Siftable .
That 's what 's doing is doing is using the sun .
Video : The sun is sun .
David Merrill : Now she took a treat the scene .
Video : The treat the homeless .
Bel work ! Yeah !
So , you 're bucking the Siftable and put neighborhood --
Video : Bau !
-- invent your story .
Video : Hio !
DM : It 's a story with the open open , and it can decide how you flight .
DM : It 's a story with the open open , and it can decide how you flight .
Video : Very strat it .
DM : The last example I have the time to show you is a time , I 've got to show you is a tool , to sample and execguing music .
It 's a instrument , I realized that , to samples and make music .
Siftable here , the Six of the bottom , based and bacteria .
Each one of these has four different variations , and you can choose what to use .
You can also put these sound in a sequence from you to compories .
And I 'm going to show you a suit , " sound , "
These are actually actually that you can control from the vision , like the reverbero and the filter .
The attacks to a particular sound and then inclens to traveling it .
And then there are the general effects like time and volume , which is apply to the sequence .
We 're looking at how it works .
Video : We 're going to start a base in two Siftable sequence , " we 're going to put it in a series , we add the way , we add the way , we add the other base .
Now I put a basis of the bottom line .
Video : Now add of percussions --
Video : I 'm going to put the phild to bacteria , so I can control the effect from the vial .
Video : I can fast the internal sequence of the interal sequence time from one side or another .
Video : I 'm going to add the game to give the low low low to make more expression .
Video : I can recombine the sequence of the sequence of the flight .
So I don 't have to do it before , but I can improve , make it more corner or more .
And now , finally , I can spend the whole sequence of inclining to the Siftable on the left .
Thank you .
So , you can see , my passion is to build new interfaces of the machine interfaces as well as they work our brain work and body .
And today , I 've had time to show you one of the result of this path , and also some possibility that we try to bring out of the lab .
The concept I want to put you is that 's coming up this new generation of objects to interact with digital media , which will bring information in our world , which will bring information in our world .
Thank you very much .
I don 't see the time I 'm talking to you .
I 'm a writing .
I 'm going to cross books is my profession , of course .
It 's also love and the fascination of my life .
And I don 't expect that can change .
But , I said , something particular happened recently in my life and my career , which has me brought me to report the whole with this work .
The particular thing is I 've been wrote this book , this whose whose book , " Mangia , Prega , " which , what diversity from my previous books , for some reason I was going to use in the world and becomes a great feelational , besty , besty , and it 's an interational feelational , and it 's a great feelational , besty called " Mangia , " Mangia , " What 's the
And the result is that everywhere to go now , people treatments treatments .
It 's true --
They 're going to have all worry and they say , " Do you don 't know more to do ?
You don 't have fear to keep writing for all of life without able to create a book that can be able to create a book that can be somebody ? "
that can be important to somebody ? "
It 's sure , you know .
But I could go worse , at the end of the one I remember , I was a little bit more than 20 years ago , when I started to say , I was a writing .
I was going to indict the same reaction .
And people said , " Do I don 't temes to have success ?
You don 't know the same same journation of the refit of killed you ?
You don 't have fear to do this mestize for all of life without anything about it , and to die on a cue of dream with the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of failure ? "
So , you know .
The answer -- the short answer to all these questions is : " Yeah . "
I 'm fear of all of those things .
I 've always had fear .
And I also have some of the other things that people can 't inguess .
How much the algae and other things like .
But , as I writing that I thought and I 'd ask me last multily is why ?
Is it rational ?
It 's logical that anyone has to expect that anybody to be spent from a job that you 've been born to do .
But what 's so that particular in the impressive creative , and it 's about nervous health mental forward to a way that other carry ry ry not doing ?
How my father , for example , he was a chemical engineer and not remember one time in his 40 years of activity in his 40 years of activity in which was asked if he was going to be engineer ?
There was never -- that blogged , that blogged , like ?
It didn 't work that , you know ?
Onestly , the chemical engineers like group have not certainly , in the seuries , wall-a-reputation of being alcolized .
We have enough writers , we have enough this reputation , and not just writers , but creative creative of any kind , we have this reputation of being enormous .
And it 's not the other that you look at the triad of the magnifetime of the magnifments of the magnifetime of the people , they die young people and often .
And the ones that you don 't have sound to be really disfacts from their dunes .
Nortman Mailer , before I die , in the last interview of his book , " Every my book , he killed me a little more " extraordinary affermonstration about work .
But we don 't buy the box when we heard this because we 've heard these things so long that we 've all completely interiorized and accepted the notion that creativity and suffering are in some way , and that art , at the end , at the end , at the end , it will always be a little bit of the bottom .
And the question I want to take all of today is : you know , you know with this idea ?
It 's good , because it 's also looking at this one centimeter of a distance to me not good for this supposition .
I think it 's odious .
And I think it 's also dangerous and I don 't want to see the perpetuated in the next century .
I think it 's better encourage our big creative minds to live .
And I certainly know that , in my case -- in my situation -- it would be very dangerous , I 'm going to start to fire that I 'm in my painting .
Of course -- I 'm very young , I 'm quite young , I 'm quite young , I 'm a little young ,
I 've still got about four job of work in me .
And it 's very likely that everything I 'm going to write about the world as the work that I 'm going to use it after I spent it , I 'm going to be judged in my last book .
I 'm going to be slavery , because we 're all more or friends here -- it 's likely that my big success is my big success .
Oh , Gesus , who thought !
You know that 's the kind of thought that leads a person to start to start bing in the morning and I don 't want to do that .
I would like to keep doing this work that we 're going to do this work that .
So , the question is becoming , like ?
And so I think , after many reflections , which the way to work to keep writing is to create a psychological construct , OK ?
I have to find a distance of safety of me , I 'm writing , and my natural anxial , which is about what I writing is going to get it to get up to the time , trying to find other society , trying to find other society , trying to find other society to see if they could have an improve ideas and more sane and more healthy and more sane and more sane to have some of ideas and more sane to have to see if they could have some of the ideas and more sane ideas and more sane
how to help people create creative to management to management to management ,
And that research has taken me to the Grek and ancient Rome .
Seguitees because I 'm given in circle and then back .
In the ancient Grek and ancient Rome -- people didn 't seem to believe that creativity came from men , OK ?
It thought it was this spirit look at the divine and that came up and the men from a few distant source and unknown , for distant reasons and unknown , for distant reasons and unknown , for distant reasons and unknown , for the distant reasons and unknown ,
The greaten were called these spiriters of creativity " demons . "
Socrate , wonderful , he believed to have a demon that elareas from away away away away .
Roomes were the same idea , but they called that the " species of spirit without a genius .
That 's great , because Roands didn 't think that a genius was somebody particularly intelligent .
They believe that a genius was this sort of devine entity that had been living in the muri of a study of a artist , a little bit like the elfo Dobby , and that came out to the job of the art of the artist and to modeling the result of that work .
Here is the emotional -- that 's the distance of which I 'm talking about -- that 's psychological construct that you protect to protect your work .
And all of you knew that it was what it worked , right ?
So the anti-artists were protected to certain things , like , for example , too much narcise , right ?
If you have your work was except you couldn 't take it all the deserve , all of you know that the waste was helped to this incorporeum .
If you have your failure , it was not all cold , right ?
Everyone knew that was your genius to be a inable .
And so people han conceived in the Occient for very long time .
And then the Rinches came and everything changed , and all this big idea ; we put the human being in the middle of the universe over the universe and the mysteries and without more leave space to create mitize the creatures and without leave the devinity .
This was the principle of humanity , and people started thinking that creativity came up with thinking that creativity came out of the ililikely .
And for the first time in the story , you start to refert to this or artist as a rather than a genius with a kind of genius .
And I have to say , I think that was a big mistake .
I think I allow to someone , a simple person to believe that as a recipient as a founount , the essence and the surprising , creativity , inknowable and ethernable and ethernable , and ethernable and ethernable to the fragile psychchchologist .
It 's like to ask somebody to ingoiating the sun .
Deform and destauring and destainable all these ingestilifetime and then it 's all these ingestilies .
And I think it was this pressure to have destroyed the artists in the spaced 500 years .
And if that 's true , and I think that 's true , and I think that 's the question becomes , and now ?
Can we do that .
Maybe I 'm going to go back to a more advantical comprement of humanity and mystery creative .
Or maybe not .
Maybe we can 't cell 500 years of rational thinking in a 18 minutes in a devices .
And there 's probably people in the audience who would be legitimate to the scientific notion of , you know that they follow the people spring the next people spring the things that are actually doing the people spring in the projects .
I 'm going to be not convinced all about this thing .
But the question I 'd like to take is -- why no ?
Why would I not think that in this way ?
Because it 's more sense of anything that has ever heard to explain the exasperant imprevebility of the creative process .
A process that , as anyone who ever I 've been trying to do something -- so , all of this , you don 't compored .
And , in fact , it can sometimes seem completely paranormal .
I did this inagainst recently , with the extraordinary , who has now 90 years , but that 's been a poeter for all of life and said that during her childhood in the rural Virginia , working out in the rural Virginia , and I feel that , when a poetime came from the landscape .
He said that it was like a frageous tracy of air .
And that came up with her from the landscape .
It 's felt that , because he was trying to get the land under his feet .
He knew I had one thing to do at that point and was of words , " run as a matta . "
And so it 's going to correct home and it was sitting from this poem , and it would not have to get a piece of paper and a math , and a math , and it was recovery , collect and trapart it on the page .
Sometimes I couldn 't be fast enough enough , so it 's going to be fast , so it was going to have to get home and the roolar , and he was going through it and she would continue to reach through the landscape , trying to break through the landscape , trying to get it through the landscape , trying to get it through the landscape , trying to get it into the house and she said , " another poet . "
Then there were those times -- this piece of the piece that I never would be -- there were some moments in which was almost losing , OK ?
So , he was running home and she was trying to the card and the poeed was through , and he was a math right in the way , and then he was like if you fallon , and then he was like if you fallon with the other hand and the stefferved .
It was a poem of the poem of the coda and reput it in his body and the reput it on the page .
And in these cases , the poem would be presented on the perfect , and intact but the contrary , from the last word at the first .
So when I felt that I thought -- it 's just a very except , it 's just the same thing .
Not all my creative process -- I 'm not a construct !
I 'm a mulo , and my way to work is ; I 'm going to see it at the same orary orary every day and I 'm going to get up and I 'm going to get up in the hold .
But even I , in my aggin my width , I 've been paying against that thing , sometimes .
And I guess that 's also many of you the han done .
You know , even though the work and ideas came up with a certain source , you can 't know the honestly , I can 't know it .
And what is this thing ?
And how can we relate to it it in a way we don 't lose your head , but rather , what do we make us remain source ?
So , as I think , the best example of the time I have the South Waits , which I interviewed a lot of years ago for a day .
We were talking about this , and you know , Tom , for the majority of life was the incarnation of the artist retively contemporary , trying to control , to make these species , to make these species , to make these species of impults .
But then I 'm going to get it , and one day , and one day as it was driving on a Los Angeles , changed everything for him .
He was going to fast and all of a traat this little framment of melodia , which comes in his head as it does the inspiration , and the wild , and the wild , and the deserve , but it doesn 't know how to take it .
It 's not a piece of paper , it has no matter , it 's not a math , it 's not a math .
So I started to feel this species of old old old old old old old old old species , " I 'm going to lose , and I 'm going to lose , and I 'm going to get oxyoned by this sessed sessed sessed by this song .
I 'm not good enough and I can 't do it . "
And instead of going to stop , you 're stopped .
I 'm going to put the whole whole mental process and made something completely new .
I 'm just just the sky and said , " Scause , I 'm not seeing that ? "
" You think that can write a song hour ?
If you really want to existing , you want to be a bit more opporting one when I can take me me me for you .
And you 're going to be able to importantly somebody else today .
You 're going to disturbing Leonard Cohen . "
And his process of working on this .
Not work , the job was still dark .
But the process , and the heavy ansia that was attended when he took the genius , the genius that was out of him out of him , and that was coming back from where , and it was going back from where , and I 'm going back to where , and it was going back from where , and it was going to be a whole thing and then .
But you know , this is a little bit of a collaboration between Tom and this strange , and this strange and outside that it was not Tom .
So how I felt that story to change a little bit that story I was working and I was working and I was always save me .
This idea , I 'm going to save me when I was writing " Mangia , Prega , and I 'm going to go to something and we 're working on something and we don 't know and we 're working on something and we don 't know and we 're going to start thinking that will be an abstror , which is going to be the worst book that I 'm going to be an abstract , which is going to be the worst book .
Not just bad , right , right the worst book written .
And I started thinking about giving this project .
But then I remember Tom I talked about the air and I tried to do it .
So I went up my face in the dark and I 'm going to get my face and deressed my commitment to a vacuum of the room .
And I said , " See , what 's , " See , what we know that if this book is not going to be brilliant , not going to be brilliant ?
Because as I see you , I 'm putting all I have , I don 't have this .
So if you want to be better , you have to presenting you and do your part .
Okay . But if you don 't do it , you know what , I don 't do it .
I 'm going to write the same because it 's my job .
And I 'd like to please that it was recorded that I 'm presented to do my part , " Because -- at the end is so , OK -- I 'm going to -- I 'm going to be in the deserts of the people were rounded for dance to the gysacra , and music that went back to the alba .
And they were always magnify because the ballerini were professionals and were fantastic .
But every lot , rarely , something happened , and one of these artists had become actually transpendent .
And I know you know what I 'm talking about , because I know you have all seen , at some point , a performance that you have all seen , and so .
It was like if the time you stopped , and the ballerny , and it was walked through a kind of labs , like 1,000 notes before , but everything was all all of them .
And suddenly , I don 't look at the same as a human .
But it 's accese from the divinity in the illuminated of divinity .
And when this happened , you know , the people knew what was , they were called it .
They were conged their hands and they started to dog , " Allah , Allah , God , God , " God , God , God , " God , God , "
That 's God , you know .
Curious note historical -- when the More invases the Spain , I was this abitude with them and the pronoundine , " Allah , " in the luch , Allah , " in " " " Ole , " the " " " " " " Ole , " which you can still feel in the corries .
In Spain , when a artist has done something impossible and magic , " Allah , " Allah , " Well , I was brink , I was bringing , " Teen , " incomprensive , " which is a last thing .
And it 's great because we need it .
But , the problem comes the day after , for the ballerself , when you 're sweet and discover that are the 11 of Martedesesday and I 'm going to go to the end of God .
It 's just a mortal with gran bad bad kitches , and maybe it 's not going to be able to make that altitude .
And maybe nobody will you have the name of God , and what does it have to do with the rest of his life ?
It 's difficult .
This is one of the most painful recognize to make in a creative life .
But maybe it doesn 't have to be so angoscious if you can 't believe , and you can 't believe , and that the most extraordinary aspects of your being from you same .
But you 're just making you , you 're going to be the data in prestt from a inimaginable source of your life that you have to go to somebody else , when you finished .
And , you know , if we think about this everything changes .
And so I started thinking about , and it 's sure as I thought I 've thought for different months during the work of the book that I 'm going to have to be , the dangerous , attesissim , attesissively followed my great success .
And what I have to keep me when I feel I 'm going to get out of this is , not fear .
Not just just just to your work .
Continua to introducts for your part , any can be .
If you 're going to ball , you know .
If the divine , assurd to you , assurd it , and I 'm going to leave some kind of wonderful , for one moment through your efforts , then , " Ole ! "
You 're doing that same your dance .
And " Ole ! " You know , you know , you know ,
I think I was , I think I was a teaching it .
" Ole ! " You know , even for us , even for love human and testing tals from to make you represent to make you keep to present you .
Thank you .
Thank you .
June Cohen : Ole !
How you know I 've talked about some of these projects on human genome , about what can meet and discovery of new new set of genoes .
We 're beginning a new performance . We started to digital biology and now now we started to digital digital code , we 're both both in a new biology , designing and synthesize life .
We always tried to bring great questions .
" What 's life ? " It 's something that many biologists think have tented to understand vary livelily .
We 've tried different approaches , we reduced to the minimum .
We 're digitizens of almost 20 years .
When we sequenced the human genome was treated to go from the analog of the computer .
Now we ask us : can we regenerate life , or create new life from this digital universe ?
This is the map of a little organism , Mycoplasma genitalium , which is the species from the smaller genome of the smaller genome .
And we tried to reduce the genome to create a little bit more .
We 're able to eliminate a hundred genes of about 500 that are here .
But when we put a look at his metabolic map , it 's relatively simple respect to our .
I believe me , this is simple .
But when we look at all the genes we can eliminate , one at the time , it 's very unlikely that this can bring a living cells .
So we decided that the only forth to progree was synthesize this chromosome way to get the components to bring some of these fundamental questions .
And so we started the adventure of " Can Can we synthize a chromosome ? "
Can it confeeling to produce these big molecules that we never have to create these big molecules that we never have to create before ?
And , in case , we can make a chromosome ?
A chromosome is just a piece of inert material .
The speed that we 're able to digital life is growing to remarkable life is growing to requentially .
Our skill of the ability to write the genetic code , instead of slowly , but it 's improving .
And our most recent result , the result of the exponential .
We 've been beginning of 15 years ago .
The process of required many steps , starting with a biothetic required before we started the first experiments .
But we found that synthesize DNA is very difficult .
There are tens of thousands of machines in the world that producing little segments of DNA , long , and it 's a degenerative process : the most recigment is a recigent process : the most error there are .
So we had to develop a new method to assemble these framments and correcrecrect the errors .
And that was our first entative tacket information from the Phi of the GH 174 .
It 's a little virus that kills bacteria .
We designed the fragments , effectively effectively rement of the errors and get a molecule of about 5,000 lectop-laping .
The interesting part is when we took this piece of inert chemical material , and we put it in bacteria , bacteria have started reading this genetic code and to propay this genetic and to propay this genetic and protected it in viral .
The viral particles have then been refused by cells , they 're back and they 're back and they destroyed .
I 've talked about recent recent with a oil industry , and I 've been talking about that they 're certainly compressed this model .
They have recil of you .
We think that this is a situation where the software can actually build its own hardware in a biological system .
But we wanted to do things in the big big .
We wanted to build the whole chromosome of bacteria .
I 'm more than 580 miles the letters of genetic code .
So we thought we made it in the cassets of the virus , so we can change the cassets to understand what are the components of a living cells .
The design is crucial , and if we start with digital information in a computer , these have to be very accurate .
When we sequenced this genome for the first time in 1995 accurategy was a mistake for every 10 miles .
We found , we found , and we had to be 30 mistake . If we had that original sequence we would never be able to do it work .
One part of the process is designing segments , 50 laughting that are very very very long , 50 lecking segments to build subunity higher and they work together .
We 're going to try to be a single one .
You probably read that you are going to read that we insert the grab we 're going to be a big bed .
Think of this : We have a genetic code on four letters : A , C , G and T.
Three of those letters together , they 're about 20 loters , and there 's a specific order to read for every friend of the letters for every fright-iny add .
So we can use the genetic code to write words , frases , thinking .
What we did at the beginning is autographing it .
Some of them have been delusers from the fact that it wasn 't poem .
We designed these segments to just just just a unique for me .
There are some of them , and they put them up and put them .
And we started assembling with segments , start with segments from five to seven miles , unending up , so that we 've been to make a segments of 24 miles the lectural lecture of 24 miles the letters .
Every step , we 've produced these segments in abundance so that we 're trying to create a very very robustoking processes -- as you 'll see in a minute .
We 're trying to automatize the process .
So , this seems to be the tabellone of the bottom of a basket .
When we get these very long segments , more than 100 miles , more than 100 miles , they 're not going to grow more directly in E.
It 's the modern instruments of modern biology .
So we 've been looking at other mechanisms .
We knew about another mechanism called recombination omologue , which in biology is to repair the DNA to repair the segments .
Here 's an example .
This organism , called Deinococcus radiodurans , can assorb three million rad rad .
You can see in the superior as its chromosome of the square remarkable .
In 12 -- 24 hours is remarkable to be remarkable .
There are thousands of organisms that are able to do that .
These organisms can sitting completely .
They can be in vacuum .
I 'm absolutely sure that life existing in space , and you know , and you know , and you know , and they 're saving water .
In the United States , NASA showed that this is .
This is a picture of the molecule we built using these processes , just using the lights with the design of appropriate design of the segments that we 've built up with the segments .
The lights assemble le le alone .
This picture was not taken with a microscope , but with a microscope , but with a microscope .
It 's a big molecule we can see it with a microscope with a law microscope .
These are phophoto a time of about six seconds .
This is the advertising that we 've done little time ago .
I 'm more than 580,000 letters of genetic code .
It 's the biggest molecule of a defined structure from man .
It 's a lot of molecular weight in 300 million .
If you 're going to stay it with a 10 without spaces , we would like 14-page code , it would like 14-page code .
Now , how do we work ?
Of course , tramite a virus is a game from kids .
It 's a little bit more complicated when you use bacteria .
It 's simply simple when it 's about cells as it 's eucariote like our : you can just flow the nuclear and put another , which is basically the process of clonation .
In the archaea , the chromosome is integrated inside the cell , but we have recently demonstrated that we 're able to make a complete complete trapid of a chromosome , and activity it .
We 've clear a chromosome , we 've got a microbial species .
The two are different as the men from the topes .
We added some gene and more so I could decide what I 'm going to decide what to this chromosome .
And then he 's skid with the enjome in a way to kill all the proteins .
And when we put it in the cells was stupend -- and you 're going to appreciate our own subphpho-- the new chromosome -- the new chromosome , and it 's gone into the cells .
And we started thinking that we couldn 't go beyond , but we 've tried to get more in there .
This is one of the major mechanisms of evolution .
We found that many species have added a second or a third chromosome , and I added in a second thousand traits to that species .
So who thinks about evolution as a only gene and at the time you have no way to understand the biology of biology .
There are some of the ency called me " restription of restription that I 'm going to get DNA .
The chromosome that was in the cells didn 't have one .
The cellphone phone 's chromosome , which we have inserito------------------cell phone .
It 's expressed , and he recognized the other chromosome as an estraneum material , and we 've got all the cell , and we 've got all the cell and the new chromosome .
It 's become blue because of the genes we 've inserted .
And in a short leverage of time , all the characteristics of a species are gone , and it turned out in a new species , based on the new software that we 've inserted in the cells .
All the proteins have changed , the membrane have changed , and when we read the genetic code is what we have transfit .
Now , this might seem alchemy genetics , but altering the software , we can change things in a kind of substantial enough .
Now , I 've explained that that you don 't talk about genesesis -- but I 've already been talking about three million years and a half of evolution , and I said that maybe we 're going to create a new version of Cambrian explosion in which will be created new species on this digital process .
Why do that ?
I think that 's enough obvious when we think about our needs .
We 're going to go from six billion and a half a half of people in the next 40 years .
Right to give an example : I 'm born in 1946 .
Now there are three people on the planet for each one existent in 1946 , there will be four .
We 're having problems now to find food , fresh water and pull , medical and wealth and a half of people .
It 's going to be more than that for nine billion .
We 're using five billion carbon carbon , more than 30 billion baries of carbon ,
That means a million baries a day .
When we 're trying to find biological processes , or any kind of process to replace , it 's going to be a huge challenge .
We have to keep all the emission of CO2 , these materials that ended up in the atmosphere .
In today , thank you to discovery scientific discovery in the world , we have a database with about 20 million genes , and I like to think that are the design components for the future .
The electronics industry only only a dozen of about components , and think about how many different things are coming out .
Our limititites here are principles of the reality of the biological reality and our imagination .
We have a lot of techniques , because we have a rapid of synthesization , in order to create what we call a combinatory genomics .
We 're able to build a big robot that can produce a million chromosome a day .
Think of processing these 20 million genes or to try to optimize the processes to make eight or drugs , new vaccines , we can change , thank you , we can change , thank you very much , and create more biology molecular biology now that in the last 20 years of science .
And it 's just a standard selection .
We can choose for the possibility of survival , or production or fuel , or production of vaccine ,
This is an instantaneous software software programmed about which we 're working for being able to several and design species .
Well , we don 't know how they 're going to be .
We know exactly how it 's their genetic code .
Now we 're focusing on the high-generation of the fourth of the fourth of the fourth of the fourth of the fourth of the fourth of the fourth of the fourth of the fourth of the fourth of the fourth of the fourth of the fourth of the fourth of the fourth of the fourth of the fourth of the fourth of the fourth of the
You have seen that you can summarize that thanol was a finished experiment .
We have a second and third generation that 's going to use enough to be hand-up sal cold and higher than the higher or different kinds of butanol , or different kinds of butanol .
But the only way the biology that biology can have a big impact without increase the cost of food and limitaren would be transforming the CO2 in matter , and we have the income to design cells that can reach them , and we think we have the first first , and we think we can get the first carbon , and we think we have the first high-fourth of the quarter in about 18 months .
The solar solar light with CO2 is a metodo-- but in our discovery , we 've found different metods .
This is a organism we 've described in 1996 .
It 's about 2,000 feet of the deep--focus of the ebollition of water .
They create a meter from CO2 molecular hydrogen molecular as a source of energy .
We 're trying to understand if we can intubes CO2 , which can easily be transformed to be transformed to tramite this process .
So , we think we might be able to increase what we might be able to increase what 's the question of " which is Noi , we have the goal of the bottom of replace the goal of replace the whole thing that we can be able to reproducing oil industry .
Exactly . If you don 't have to do that from TED , where can you ?
It would be a main of energy .
And also , we 're working on the same metods to create vaccine instantanes .
You 've seen this year with the flu , we 're always back to a year and with a dollar in less when it 's coming up right .
I think what you can change is making combinable vaccine in ancient advaccine .
That 's how the future might start to look like , now , the tree of evolution , accelerating the evolution with bacteria , and infinally cell cells .
We 're so much from the improve people .
Our purpose is to make it very long enough to try to live enough to try to do it . Thank you very much .
So , first of all of you will show you , the faster , the faster , of the new technology we 've taken to Microsoft in follow a bution almost a year ago . This is Seadragon .
It 's a environment that you can interact is at the local level that you can interact with a huge amount of visual data .
We 're seeing a lot of Jange gabyte , photo-to-up photos with a kind of a zoom , and in a friend , I have to see imagery as we want .
And it doesn 't matter how much much much much of information that we see , how big these things are big data or imagery .
Most of the digital photography , but this for example is a scanning from the Bioteca scansion of Congress , and reenter in the gams of 300 megaxing .
It doesn 't make any difference because the only thing that you have the only thing that you have the number of pixels on your screen in any moment . It 's also a very ffflies . It 's also a very ffflies .
This is a book , of the data of not imagery .
This is Casa desolate of Dickens . Every colonna represented a chapter .
So , I 'm going to show you that it 's just about imagery , we can do something like this , to see that it 's a real real representation of the text , not a picture .
It might be a little artificial to read a electronic book .
It doesn 't have the advice .
This is a more realistic example . It 's a number of the Look .
Every picture is the beginning of a sewhere .
And it really gives you the pleasure and the beautiful experience of reading the version of a magazine , or a quotidian , which is for a mold .
We also did something with the angle of this particular number of the Look of this particular number of of the Lardian .
We created a fashion advertising advertising , and we 've put it in a normal advertising -- and we 've inserted a remarkable advanced .
If you want to see the characteristics of this car , you can see here .
Or other models , or even the specific techniques .
And this really demonstrates some of these ideas to eliminate the limits of space on the screen .
We hope that that that means you put up the pop-up , and other porcheries , I don 't have to be necessarily .
Of course , the map is one of the most obvious applications for this kind of technology .
And on this is not going to lose time , if we don 't say that we have contribute to give them in this field .
These are all the streets in the United States , and I 'm all the streets of the NASA .
So now we go to something else .
This is actually actually , from the right right right now , you can go to see it .
It 's a project called Photosynthesist , which combine two different technologies .
One is Seadragon and the other is a very interesting visual computer that is a very interesting visual computer that we 've been a student of the University of Washington , with Steve Seitz of UW Seitz 's Microsoft Research .
And it 's from the vision of Seadragon .
You can see it when we do this this kind of screens , where we can go from a image to another and have this kind of experience to the last multiple .
But the space of the imagination of the imagery of this has actually a meaningful meaning .
The algorithms of visualization of the computer have recorded these imagery , so that they 're going to corresponding to places that I imagine -- all of the paintings that I think -- all of the paintings -- all of the paintings -- they 're scated . Here you see the part of a slide or imaging , and these things are all of a picture of space or imaging .
I don 't know if I have to show you some other environment .
There are some of the most space .
I want to go directly to one of the original data of Noah-- and this comes from a previous prototypes that we 've done for the first time , to show you what I think about the first time is really the key key to show that what I think is really the key key to show this technology , the technology Photosynthroy-tosynthroy-based data , which we 've put in the web .
We had to worry about legal aspects and forth .
This is a reconstruction of Notre Dame images in Flickr , Notre Dame , Bather digitrore Dame in Flickr and you get imagery in magic magic , other of the campus and on . And you 're going to say . And you have a picture that 's discovery , which is discovery , and it 's discovery , and you have to look at this model .
So I 'm all imagery pressed by Flickr and I 've been all connected to this way .
And it 's possible to navigate this very simply way .
You know , I would never have thought to end up to work for Microsoft .
It 's very gratifying , I 'm going to get this kind of accovery here .
I think you can see that it 's a lot of different photocameras : from those of the cell phones to those of the phones of the SLR , a meaning , put together in this environment .
And if I can , I try to try to those strange .
Very are blown by easy , etc .
It 's some of this is a series of photographs -- and it 's a little bit of photographs --
This is a poster of Notre Dame registrated .
We can go from the poster to the physics of this environment .
The essential point is that we can do with social environment . This is now taking data from the whole memory , from the interal memory , from the interal memory of how to apping the land , from visual point of view -- and connects all those data .
All of those pictures become connected together , the major of the parts .
You have a whole model of land that emerge .
Think about this as a prolungation of Stephen Lawler on Earth .
It 's something that grow up in complexity as people are using it , and the advantages to be used to increase with the use .
Their pictures are marcated with insert metadicals from other people .
If you get the idea of contrast to contract all these suntiny , my picture of Notpractice , my chchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchtec .
Of course , a consequence of all of this are virtual models extremely elaborated , all of the interesting things that are not just alive and imagery , but from the memory imagery , but from the memory memory .
Thanks thank you .
Chris Anderson : I realized ? What your software ? What your software is that you have to do is that at some point , in the next years , all of the next years , all of the world will be practically connected with ?
BAA : Yeah . What 's doing is doing it in practice .
It 's creating hyperlink , if you want , you , you 're in imagining .
And it 's doing it in the base of imagery .
The thing is really really interesting if you think about the wealth of information semanties that many of these images that are possible .
How when you do a imagery of imagery , you have a phrase and the text on the web page has a lot of information about imagery .
Now , what happens if that picture is connects all your photo ?
So the amount of interconnection and the amount of rcheck and the amount of rches that are really enormous . It 's a classic classic .
CA : Blaise , it 's really amazing . Compliments .
BAA : I thank you very much .
One of the pleasure that when you traveles and one of the delivery research is the able to live between who has no inforgotten that antials have no inforgotten , the ancient adverte the ancient , in the wind , you get the spring of the plant , and we have to lost the plant .
Basti thinking that the monstrange Jaguar vide Lattea , or that the monites of the old Inuit 's still remarkable meaning , or that in Himalaya , the budddying the respair of Dharma , but that the most of the most people that we live in the anthropology of the anthropology of reality , but it 's the idea that we live in , but it 's just a model , but it 's just a model of reality ,
the consequence of a particular adaptative choices that our adaptative , and it 's good or bad , many generations ago .
And , of course , we 're all share of the essential tracts .
We all prove . We all procret .
We 're subjects to start .
We have to death the inesorability of death , so we don 't surprise if we 're going to save and wherefore --
We all have a art art .
What 's the particular one of the song of the song , the rhythm of every culture .
It 's not the Penan Is of the Borneo , or the Woman , or the Wewish 's werries , or the desert of the Kenya settle in the heart of the Ande Curero , or a camera in the heart of Ande , or a cameat in the heart of the Sahara .
He was my journey was my journey in the desert a month ago , or a food in values in the values of Qomolangle , the demotion of the world .
All of these people teaching us are teaching us that are other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking ,
And if you think you 're going to take a moment , it 's a concept that can give you hopefully .
Insides , with , myriads of the world create a ragnote of life and cultural life that we have the planet and it 's important for the planet and it 's important for the planet as a kind of a planet as a biosphere .
And you can think about this cultural ragnoise as a nine , and you can call the etnosphere , the whole whole whole concepts , dreams , and intuitions , intuitions , intuitions , intuitions , intuitions , intuitions ,
The etnosphere is the fantastic patriage of humanity .
It 's the symbl of what we are and what we can be in how much inquisitive .
And because it was gravly consumed , as as a big big as it was successful , and it 's very quickly .
Nothing , for example , would say that the 50 percent of all the species is , or it 's about the orlo of the extinction just because it 's fake , or -- in the higher ispocalitten -- in the world of biological diversity -- and you don 't even even close to the highest diversity .
The indiculous of all of that is , of course , the language .
When you were born in there were 6,000 languages on this planet .
A language is not just a very composal of a series of rules or a series of rules .
A language is the idea of the spirit of human spirit .
It 's the middle of which the animal of every culture comes in the material .
Every language is a forest of the mind , a nine , a thought , a thought of a nine inspiritual .
And of those 6,000 languages , as we are here in Monterey , at least half the time in the orecchies of the children .
They 're not taught to children , the people who want to say , at least that you don 't know something , who are already death .
What is the most sad of being fly from the silent , of the last talk to a language , of the last talk of a language , not have a way to get the wisdom of the children 's children ?
This is a little bit of some world in some part of the world every two weeks : every two weeks a hundred , and a child , and it 's in the ultural , the last syllables of a ancient language .
And I know , some of you will say , " Do you know , " Does it 's not better ?
The world would not be a better place if we talk about the same language ? " Benissim , then we talk about yoruba . We talk about yoruba .
We talk about kogue .
You 're about a tract thing that means not to talk about your language .
I 'd like to do a journey through the etnosphere --
a little journey in the etnosphere to give you a kind of what we 're losing .
Many of us dimenting that when I say , " different ways of existing , " I mean , " I think , " I think , " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " "
We make this for example of this Barasana , in Amazonia , the popular of the anacond of the anacond , which creates the myth of the latest sandwest in the west pants in the west pants of sets .
It 's a popular that 's not able to distinguing the blue color blue from the green focused in the forest , which depends on the forest .
They have a strange language and a matrimonial , called " exogamia language , " " You have to save a person who talks about a different language .
All of this has radical past mitological past , but it 's the particularly families , which are in these families in these extent families in which are in these expensive hacts .
They 're limited to listening and then they start talking .
We take one of the most interesting tribes that I 've lived , the Waorani of Ecuador an inner , an incredible popular people who had the first contacts in 1958 .
In 1957 missionaries have tremendous conduct a mistake .
They did the top photographs that they were referred to the photography that they were required , and forget that this population of the forest , and the rainforest , had never seen anything bi-dimensional .
They collected the land , they have been collected by the ground , they went to research a shape or a glower , and I 've got to end up the hell , and they kill the five missionaries with the lance .
But Waorani doesn 't kill the southern .
They killed them between them .
54 percent of the mortality was caused by their same .
We 're sitting at eight generations and we found two , of the death of natural , and when we have been tricked to know , they had an invectually deed , and then they had been tremendous , and then they had an incredible knowledge of the forest .
The cruers were able to recognize the animal of 40 steps and recognize the species .
In the first ' 80s , I was assigned a very interesting task when my Harvard professor , if I wanted to go to Harvard , if I wanted to go to Harvalier and Tonton Macope , and Tonton Macope , and I impossessing out of the speaking , and I put up the fabablies .
For a sense of miracologist , I 'd have to understand the Vodoo culture . And that Vodoo not that magic is not magnine .
It 's quite a complex view of the world .
Very interesting .
If I ask you to tell me the big religions of the world , what would you say ?
Cristianesity , Islam , Buddism , Ebraism , etc .
A continent is always left , thinking that the sub-Saharan Africa has no religious feels . And instead and the Vodoo is not the other than the distilside of these concepts , very profound religious , very profound , very profound religious , very profound that the distild of slavery .
What makes it interesting to make voodoo is the intended between life and death .
So the jobs are hiding the spiriters .
The spirites can be invoced by Grande Acqua , they response to the rhythm of the dance and they replace time time to the alive the alive in a short way that for a short short , and they 're replaced the becomes .
So , for this voodooists , " You white , you go to speak about God .
We say , we love in the temple and we dive God . "
And from the moment that you 're all possedoubt , is the spirit that you 're willing to be bad ?
So you 're in these incredible events : follow voodoes in the state of trance that touch impunts are town a rather strong demonstration , a rather strong demonstration of the mind when it 's catalized in a state of extreme .
In all the people I lived the most amazing people that I 've lived the most extraordinary of Sierra Nevada Santa Marta , in Colombia .
It 's the ancient civilization that once once they were living on the caraibles that the Colbia in the conquest of the Colbia , popular rhythetime , the popular massive wild playing on the vuletbics .
In a continent , in a drug continent , this popular is never been conquent by the spaged .
But they 're now now now now now , they 're governmented by a clero , but their formation is really extraordinary .
The young people following come from from families to three or four years , and they live in a good world , and they live sat at a buy world , and homben in the bottom of the glaciers of the glaciers for 18 years .
Two doubts years of the noine years of proposition to reproduce the nine months of management that transforming in the user of the mother , now are metaphor in the Grande Mother .
So , for all that time , they 're acculturate to the values of their society , values that make their preglacier and only their preglacier , or to say the constantly cost -- or to say the ecological balance .
In term of this incredible initiation , they 're improvised out and for the first time in their life , at the age of 18 years , they see a alba . And in that active , and that I 've got to recognize the values of beautiful paesthetime , all that they learned in theory . The pan is a step of step , all that they learned in theory . The prepan a step . And in the end , and he says , and he says , and it 's depect it 's reflect a step .
" I said , " I 'm going to tell you how I said .
It 's amazing . Now it 's study .
They call them major frackers and they say that we , fratch collies , we are the collifeter of the world .
This level of intuition is extremely important .
When we think about invote , invote in the invote , and the old story story of willing noble wild , which is a concept that 's a concept in his simplicity , we 're going to be Thoreau and we say that these populations are neighbors to the Earth of us .
The indeed popular weless is not feeling nine feeling from nine .
There 's no space for these things in the palud of the Asmsmat the gelids of the Tibet , but thank you to get the time and rate , they created a mystical mystics of Earth is not about concept of human intuition .
What does it mean ?
It means that a girl of Ande who grow up in the Exium that 's a spirit Apu who 's a spirit of the Eivers that will be a human being deeply different . And it 's going to have a different kind of rock in Montana who grow up a boy of rock of rock that 's a mountain massive rock of rocks that it 's a massive rock of rocks to be a rock of rock of rock .
That 's the dimora of a spirit or a mineral was irrelevant .
What 's interesting is that it 's interesting metaphor that defines the relationship between the individual and the natural world .
I grew up in the forests of the British credying that forests the forests of the forested of cut .
And this resist an human being different from my friends Kwawautl that credit is dimora of Hukuk and the batch of the paradise and the batch of the paradise and the spiriters that are living in the beginning of the Hamamamsa .
If you start to look at that these cultures can create different reality , you can start to understand some feelings . We take this plants .
I 've been shown this picture to aprile in the nordoctors .
Maybe some of you have heard about ayahuash , the most powerful repertively psychoactive reperperformance .
What makes it fascinating the ayahuash is not the potential to be macological clumn , but his elaboration . It 's composition from two elaboration .
In one side , this liana law of this liana launch of a series of carboline , harmful and harmful , laws .
I 'm going to take the only plants , and it 's a little astro that altera little bit of consciousness , but it 's measured with the family of a coffee , and it 's called Psychotridis .
This plant is a ptamine , very similar to serotonine , dimethylptamine-5 , methoxtamine , methoxtamine .
If you 're ever going to see Yanomami , and you 'll be a different set of species , anchches it contains a different species , anchchchicken contains .
And I think that polar the dust on the birth is a little bit like to be sparked by a paints of paints and land on a power of electricity . You know , it 's not creates a destastaursion .
I was often a lot with my professor , Richard Evan Shultes , the man who has schedelical schedelical discovery of the fungi , with his discovery of the fallucinated fungi in the 1930 in Mexico .
I think my teeth , you can 't class these tripptamine as because if you 're not talking to anyone to be hallucinated . And I mean , you can 't be sunded because they 're dened by the time , they 're not just sunded because they 're denied by a maintain , but it 's the very very monoaminoysesses .
It 's possible to assumerle with other substanti-chimps with other substants that denize MAO .
Now it 's the beautiful : The Is the cool that are in this liana are injobs of MAr , the same kind of necessary to potential the same kind of necessary to potential the tripptamine . The question is spontaneous , like these population , like these people do these populations are not like these people , but if you combine in this way , create a biochemical version that 's suit 's sum that 's sum that 's sum ?
We use the great euthror of prove and the mistake , which can reveal .
But if we ask the Indian of the Indian , they 'll tell us " The pilots of them . "
What does it mean ?
This tribes , the Cofan , has 17 variety of ayahuasks , which are neply in the forest , and that we 're going to go into the same species .
If you ask them how to stbilize their tassonomes will say , " I thought I was really understood about plants , and I didn 't know it ? "
The solution is : you take the 17 variety in a night of lone , and each one will a little piena and each one will a different dog .
So , you don 't read about the aurea Harvard , but it 's much more interesting than counting the stami .
Now , [ applaushes the problem is that even the ones of us who have to heart popular ingenes are pittoresks , but in some way we have to margins , but in some way we have to the real world , and pass beyond .
In fact , the X-century , between 300 years , it 's not going to be remember , or its technologies , but rather as the one was where we stopped and we have active acactive active active , or accept that we 're going to spend up the mass of biological diversity and cultural diversity and cultural improve . Now , it 's not the change .
All the cultures through the seusual , and it 's been involved in a new life .
And the problem is not the technology .
The Indians Sioux have no stopped to be Sioux when they put it out of the American and they don 't have stopped to be American , when they 're stopped by the horal and calan .
It 's not the change or technology that threatening the integrity of the etnosphere . It 's the power .
The flight flight of domination .
And if you give you a look at the world , you 'll find that these are not destinated cultures .
They 're living and dynamics and spinted out of the forces out of the forces of their adaptation of adaptation .
I know that 's disboboscation in the Penan Penan --
a popular notion of Sarawak , in the waste of the asian who lights lights in the forest to a generation , and now reduced to a generation ago , and now reduced to the service , where you can see the fiume inquine , where you can see the fiume inese Mar Cinese Mar Cinese Meridian , where the horizes nitate , where the horizon the horizon , where the horizon , where the horizon , where the horizon is is to laborizon ,
Women , you 're going to fall with the subtact with the forest .
Or , in Yanomami , are the disease that are the disease that are coming with the discovery of the gold .
If we move on the mountain of Tibet , where I 'm doing a lot of research , you 'll see the hard hard to the politics .
How you know the genocide , the physical extinction of a population , but the ethnocide , the destruction of life of a population of life , not just is construction of a popular life , not just is convicted , but addicted in certain environments , because it 's a part of development .
And you can 't understand the suffering of Tibet until you 're in the beginning .
I 've been loved the 6,000 miles from Chengu in China in China through Tibet through the Tibet , and I came to Lhasa with a young colleague , but just came to Lhasa , but just came up to Lhasa , I realized what we feel like to hear .
6,000 worth workers reduced in chorry and crossing .
1.2 million people killed by military , during the Cultural Rivolution .
The father of this guy was ascritical , the guy was ascritical in Panchen Lama .
That means that it was killed to the Chinese invasion .
Her is , I was the Santity in Santity in Santity that has taken the popular in Nepal .
Her mother was imprigioned and his colpe was reciple .
It was brought of birth in cartotown in the age of two hidden years under his gonna because he couldn 't have been living without him .
The sister , which has done it was in reeducational reeducation .
A day has inavailable day a coffee a Mao and , for this transgression , was moved to this transgression , it was mit to seven years .
The Tibet of Tibet can be inspired , but the spirit reesterday is from the tent .
Alla in the end , all of it is to a choice .
We want to live in the world world world world 's the monothic or we want to accovery , poly-like the diversity of diversity ?
The big anthropologists Margaret Mead , before he died her biggest paar was that , in our our own own towards this view of the world , we 're not just see the whole gama of human imagination reduced to a human imagination reduced , but one day we 'll see that the other possibility of thinking , but one day we 'll get from a sleaving , and we 're going to have other possibility .
And it 's umillion people remember that our species is existed for 600,000 years .
The Neolic Rivolution , who gave us the agriculture , which has done us substituting to the seed of the seme of the sms of the smoke with the prosa of the clero , creating the camp of the check of the specialization , and we talk about 10,000 years ago .
The modern industrialized world has been 300 years .
That 's squality history , I don 't suggests that we have the rispoints that we 're going to have to face in the millennia to come .
When to these cultures of the world is asked what to say to be human-year-old , they 're resonent with 10,000 voices .
And it 's in these answers that we all have to risk the possibility of being what we are : a conscious species , that has to make all the people and all the yards can fall the garden can fall .
I 've been shown this picture on the northern extremity of Baffin , when I went to cut up with the Inuit , and this man , Olaya , Olaya , and this man , and he told me me the wonderful story of his grandfather .
The canadd government is not always wild with the Inuit 's not always founded with the Inuit , we have to stuck our own own as we have to stay our colonies .
The grandfather of this man reflow to go .
The family , I teming for his life , he took me all the time , and all of his attitude .
You have to know that Inuit doesn 't tems the freer , they 're not pushing it .
The packs in the origin of the origin were made of paper .
The grandfather of this man didn 't have intimight from the night or from the libraries that was sweet .
It 's sgattle , it 's skeeping the ptanks in the skin in the paper and defecated in their hand . When I did it put it , they have worked a lama .
It 's spring about this hand-up collights of this coltelem of this ket , he killed a dog .
It 's taken the dog and created a brillighter , with the cass , and he made a slitta , has imbrighted another dog and it 's disappeared on the banks , collecting one in the remains ,
We want to talk about cavarsely with nothing ?
In the aprile of the canadvance government has reduced the Inuit 's total control of a larger territory of the largest California and Texas mmess .
It 's the new patria . It 's called Nunut .
It 's an independent territory . They 're all the resources .
One of the kind of splendies of as a natione-state can recognize with his population .
And , to finish , I think it 's quite obvious at least in those remote song in these remote song of the planet , realize that they 're not going to remote .
For somebody 's home .
They 're represent seitions of human imagination that are rising at the time . And for all of these children , like the dreams of these children , like the dream of these children , they become part of the hope of the hope of the hope .
From , we know about National Geographic , we 're convinced that politics will never come to anything .
We believe that the polemies --
[ Applausi is not persuasive , but we believe that stories can change the world , and maybe we 're the best institution to tell the stories of the world . Every month to tell stories of the world . Every month of our website .
156 countries transport our television dog .
Our reviews from millions of people .
Our work is traveling in the ethnosphere to bring our audience in the places that will go through which they have seen and , and , and they 'll hope , and they will hope , abbraced , and they will hope , and they will have to find a life in a plurality , and we have to find a life of life in a plurality and we have to find a life of life and to get a life of life in a plurality and we have to find a life in a plurality in a and we can go in a plurality in a and we will to get the order to get the order to have to

Thank you .
I 'm going to talk about some things I wrote in this book that I 'm hoping you 've heard and I 'm going to try to prove some of the connections , in case , you wouldn 't notice .
I want to start with what I call the " official dogma official dogma .
The official dogma official thing ?
The official dogma official dogma official dogma official dogma . " If we want to massive to be of our citizens . " The way to do that is massive freedom . "
The reason is , of the reason is , in fact that freedom is in the fact that freedom is pretious , essential for human beings .
The other is that if we 're liballs , each of us can act for all that that massive to do everything that massive , without one that you have no one that decide in name .
The way to massive freedom is massive choice .
More choices people have , more are libing , and the major is their freedom , bigger is their beneath .
This , I think , it 's so deeply roadicated in society that nobody would be able to put it in doubt .
And it 's also deeply radicated in our lives .
I 'm going to show you some examples of what progress has made it possible .
This is my supermarket . It 's not particularly big .
I 'm just just just a very simple note about conditions .
In my supermarket , there are 175 conditions , without content 10 variety of the extrite of olive and 12 aceters that you can buy for a huge amount of conditions in the inct inct of your degrees in the inct of the inct of your degrees .
That 's how it 's the supermarket .
Then you go to the electronic store , to buy a stereo : CD lector , radio , radio , piaside , the rate .
And in this single single store , there 's a big number of audio components .
We can make six and a half million different combinations using components that there are just a store .
You have to admit that there 's a lot of choice .
Altri camps : the world of communications .
Once , when I was a child , you could get all the telephone services , to pat the clearly that they were forced by mom .
It was not brought the phone , you didn 't buy it .
One consequence of that , the phone was that the phone didn 't break .
These days are gone .
We have a variety of telephone , especially between mobile phones .
That 's the cell phone .
My favorite is in the middle , lettor MP3 , tapeli cut , and forced to the cut up for the brulele .
If you don 't have seen it in the store under home , you 're standing in the middle of the house , you 're going to be able to come .
And what happens , what happens is that people enter in the negots and make this question . And you know what 's the answer is ? The answer is " No .
It 's not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn 't do that .
So , in other things that are much more important than the acquire of the acquired of the acquired of choices .
Axxxtist health : no more in the United States that you go from doctor and the doctor you have to do .
Instead , you go from the doctor , and the doctor says , " OK , we might do it , and you know , " An this benefit and these " By these benefits and risks . What do you want to do ? "
You say , " Dotore , what would I do ? "
And the doctor says , " A has these benefits and these risks , and B has these benefit and risks . "
" What do you want to do ? "
And you 're rebats , " Does if she was me , what would you do ? "
And the doctor : " But I 'm not . "
The result of the result , " autonomous " , " expression that makes it look like a beautiful thing .
But actually , it 's not that one to move the weight and responsibility of making decisions from somebody knows something , oxist , at qualclearly , to somebody else that doesn 't know , and so much of course , it 's not about the ideal condition to make a patient decisions .
There 's a huge marketing of products , and you know , and you know , if you think , you think about it has no sense , because you think you can 't buy them .
But if we can 't buy them , because there are public public public ?
The answer is that they want to domorning , we call the doctor to ask them to be .
What 's so fundamental as we have our identity is our identity . And as you see in this jump , " We don 't want to forced the children . We 're going to reach their sex at at the right moment , " we have to invent the right right now , " We have to invent the question we have to invent .
And we can reinventing how many times us .
That means that every morning , at the risk , you have to decide that kind of person .
I 'm going to stect the family and matrimony , a time time the common , and it was that it was that there was the most price as possible , and it was that it was that you were going to get the more price as possible .
The only versus it was with who , not when you , and even even what do after .
Odly , all that 's really town .
I 'm very smart students , and I do 20 percent in less than a time .
And it 's not because they 're not just brilligent .
but why are I 'm impensive , I mean to ask , " Would I say , " Would I be able to do that right now ? "
" Do I I think I 'm going to get me later ? "
I 'm interrogative logives .
And they 're trying to answer these questions , even if this implation is not complete the companies that I 'm not going to get a bear in my examples .
And they have to do that . I 'm important questions .
Now , the job : we 're lucky , like Carl sound , because technology allows us us to work every minute , every day , from every day , from every day , from the angle of the planet , and from the Hotel Randolph .
I 'm talking about , there 's a corner , and I didn 't tell anybody what , where WiFi works .
I 'm not saying , because I want to use it .
What does that mean , this incredible freedom of choice we have about work ? It 's that we have to keep , continuously , if we have to work or not .
We can go to see our son son playing with the cell phone , with the cell phone , the Blackberry in the other , and the notebook , becomes back .
And even though I 'm all spent , every minute that we see our son son , we 're also asking the partner , and we 're also asking this called ? "
" Do I answer this email ? I have to get to do this literally ? "
And also when the answer is " no , all this makes the experience of your partner , very fun from what it would be in other conditions .
So , as any part of the look , things and big , things , and big materials and life , life is a question of choice .
Once the world was this : Of course , there were some possibility , but it was not a question of choice .
The world of today is the world 's world looks like this : " It 's a positive thing , or negative ? "
The answer is Same : The answer is Same .
The positions of positions , we know , so I 'm going to talk about the negative .
All this choice compories , two actually negative effects on people .
The first , I 'm talking adoxtimally , is that produced paradow .
And so many options between which I choose to choose , it becomes very difficult .
I offer an example of a meanant : a study of flight on the volunteer .
A connects my colleague has had access to the Vanhealthy , the gigantic society , with about a million clients in 2,000 companies .
What she found is that for every 10 solutions that are offering in more , the percentage of adesion , which is the fesion of two percent .
With 50 sources , there 's 10 percent in less than adesions than when they 're available to when they 're available . Because ?
Because with 50 sources between which I choose , is maledly difficult decide , and choice is remadied to the intomorrow .
And to ask tomorrow , and I still asked the tomorrow , and of course , and of course , and of course , and of course , and of course , and I still asked them .
Capite that doesn 't mean that these work from old old work for dogs because they 're not going to have enough money , even want to say that the decision is so owner that allow the funny of work .
I 'm not talking about , they 're losing until five to a year in the work , which would be willing to be brought to be real .
So the paralalisis a consequence of having too many choices .
And I think it makes the world like this .
" And to finish , for the ethchup , or maionese or maionese ? "
You would take the right decision , if it 's for the ethernity , right ?
You don 't want to choose the wrong wrong , and you 're not going to take the wrong condition .
So this is the first effect . The second is that we can also avoid the paralalysis and do a choice , at the end , we 're less saving , we were in the result of how we would be done with less options .
And this for different reasons .
One of these is that with many condition , and what you 're choose , if you buy a perfect , it 's easy to imagine that you would have a different choice that you could have been better . And that 's what happens is that the alternative imagined that it 's that the alternative imaginated , and the replacement diant , and replaced the sophistation of the decision that you would have been a replacement , and it 's not very much much that you would have a fun , and it 's not been very much fun , very easy , very easy , very much of these , very much of these , very much much much that , very easy ,
And when it was a good decision .
And so , there 's more easy to have , it 's easily dislies of any detection of the option of choice .
And also , there 's what economists call .
Dan Gilbert has asked a very well , like the value that we 're going to depends on the things that we confronted with .
And that 's the rest , when there are many options , it 's easy representing the active lobe the active lost of the alternative alternative alternative , which is choice .
Here 's an example . I 've been schools with all of those who are not New York .
But that 's what you might think you might think .
There 's this couple of Hamptons .
A lussides .
It 's splendida . It 's all about it .
Not all of it . But what he thinks is , " Well , malit 's Agoam . "
" All my neighbor in Manhattan are on . "
" I could talk about it right in front of home . "
And it 's going to step two weeks that 's losing -- every day -- the ability to talk about where it wants .
The constantly opportunity deminures for what we have , when the choice was a cell excellent .
And the most of the options we have to consider , more the active characteristics will come up with how expensive .
Here 's another example .
This is a vigness of this .
It 's about the time , and maybe in the living time , and maybe in the living lently .
But the most important point is that anything you choice , you 're willing to do not .
The things we don 't choose are trying to attractive active active , which can make less active what we do .
Third point : spiral growing of expectation .
I tried I tried to my skin buying a new couple of jeans .
I 'm almost always jeans .
Once the jeans were just like , buy and bought them and bought from besty , just after I had a life and work , just after I had a whole life and work a lot of times , they started going well .
So , I went to buy a couple of a couple of a few years when the old old old was gone , and I said , " I need a couple of jeans , this is my cut . "
The commit said , " Look , you want to do it , and like , " Look , "
And what does you want to do with the cernera or " I 'm like , " " " " acidjugged " ? "
" Look , " Look ? "
" Seight them or covers or rots ? Bla bla -- " Continuit was like to elenjoy .
I was swheeline , and after a little bit , I 'm able to say , " I want the guy to say , " I didn 't have no idea what it was , so for a time I tried to do all jeans , and then I 'm going to use it , and then I was used to say , " I 'd never had .
It was the massive . I was all that choice I had the best .
But I felt I 'm worse .
Why ? I wrote a whole book to understand it .
The reason why I was worse is that with all that I was with all that choice was very very very highly .
I was the beginning I was expectations . I didn 't expect any except when there was just a guy , but when I saw 100 different , steps , at least one guy had to be perfect .
What I was buy , but not perfect .
After I had a chot with what I was trying to do with what I was trying to do is expectations .
The add of options in life , not doing that they 're going to increase the expectations that these are respect to the options of the same .
And this will be propair , even when the result of the result of the result of the result of the result of the result of that .
Nobody in the marketing world , if you realize .
Because if they knew it , you would not know what I 'm talking about .
The truth looks like this .
" You better know , when you were worse , " The reason why it was better when you were worse is that when you were worse was worse , I think that I 'd be able to meet of the pleasure .
Odst , in the world we live in -- opulent , industrialized citizens with expectancy -- the massive that we can hope is that things are at the altel .
You 're not surprised to be surprised because your expectations , my expectations , I 'm ingigantic .
The secret of happiness -- that you 're here -- it 's , " Brow wait . "
I mean , little bioked moment -- which are really ununried and my wife is really amazing .
I couldn 't do it better , I couldn 't have to do , I 'm not accounted .
But it 's not always a good thing .
And finally , a consequence of buy a couple of jeans discover when there 's just that kind of jeans is that when you 're not satic , and ask you " Why ? "
" Who is responsible ? "
The world is the responsible . What can I do you ?
When there are hundreds of kinds of jeans , and you buy one insuddenly , and you ask the people is responsible , it 's the responsible , it 's the clear is you .
You could do better .
Con hundreds of variety available , there are no insuccess .
So when people take decisions , even though the result is the result is alid , they feel like they 're saving and they date their own .
In the last years , the depression is explose in the industry .
I think a meaning factor -- not only , but important -- of this honave of a depression is that people have experiences in the sent , because the standard are too allow .
And when they have to explain this situation think that the colpe is they think that colve is .
So the final result is that in general , we 're better , objectively , but we feel worse .
Let me remember .
This is the official dogma , what we 're all take for good and it 's completely fly fall .
There 's no no question that a little choice that a little choice is better that I don 't have to do it , but it doesn 't have to be a little choice is better better than a little bit .
There 's a critical value , magic . I don 't know what it 's .
But I 'm sure we 've overcome from a piece of the level that choices to improve our life .
Now , from the political point of view -- I 'm almost finished -- from political view , the nocctually , the follow .
What allows this whole choice in the industrial society is the material .
There are many places in the world , and you know , you 're talking about what the problem is not that have to have some choice .
The problem is that they have too much .
So the factory that I 'm talking about is a malbe exclusive , remarkable society , rich society .
And what it does depress and array is this : Steve Levitt Levitt talked about how those expensive and discoveries of how those expensive and discoveries of money .
I mean these choices , complicated and available , it 's not that they 're just inuseful .
I 'm addict of deleteries .
They do them worse .
If a little bit of what in our society is allow it to be reversed in those where people have too points , it would not just have their life to improve but also our life .
This is what economists call a a paretian improve improve .
It 's a redistribution of all -- not just to the poor -- because of this choice in excess that we 're in the excess of this , except that we 're going to be .
So I 'm going to end , " You can be all become what you want " --
You know , people of culture , you think , " But what does that fish ? "
" It 's obvious that you can 't make anything in a glass . "
" A imagination castrated , a limited view of the world -- "
And I 'm the interpretted that , I 've been the whole thing .
But then , I think , instead , I 'm realized that that fish knows the long knows .
Because the reality of the fact is that if you mand in frantums , so that , " all of all that you can 't get the freedom . You get the paralysis .
If you break the bock , you get the box that all of diminured as well as well as well as well as well as well as you can be as much as much as possible diminured as you can be as much as much as possible diminured as .
So you 're going to get the well-being .
Everyone needs a sphere .
This is almost certainly too quickly , perhaps even for us , maybe even for us .
But the above of some symbolic symbolic symbolic and , we 're trying to be in the same .
Thank you very much .
