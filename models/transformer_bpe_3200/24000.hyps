And I showed these slides to show that the next year to show that the Pottical calculus , which for almost three million years had the size of 48 million years had the size of 48 , the U.S. continental , it 's remarkable .
But this underestimate the gravity of the problem because it doesn 't show the spessor of the ice .
The Arctic ice is , in a sense , a sense , the clean , the heart of a global climate system .
You expanded up and winter and extreme extreme .
The next next few 25 years .
The glaces are reported in red .
You see , they expand until the blue wall .
That 's the ice in the winter , which is ritired .
You can see that cosidunm lower ice , five years or more , is like blood , which is as blood , which is the body here .
In 25 years , it 's past , so .
This is a problem because the heating heating , the ice heating path of the ice ice , where there are huge amounts of carbon congle , and they 're transformed , and they turn into microbes .
It turns out to the totality of the atmosphural reming , that amount of of global warming could doubled , overoverovercome ,
In some of the laghi , in Alaska metane is already rebolling out of water .
The professor Katey Walter in the University of Alaska , I 've been taken with a team in a fast last winter .
Video : Wow ! Al Gore : Wow ! The question is if we 're also going to be .
A reason is that this termal exchange the Groenland from North .
This is a river in the glacial regime .
The layed never reached to the similar .
This is the Kangerlussuaq , in the southern of Groenland .
If you want to know how the snice the level for the sea to the ice of the ice of the ice on land , here is where it reaches the sea .
These current current currently .
And then on the other side of the planet : Antarctica , the biggest block of ice the planet .
The last month scientists have dichied that the billbox is in negative , and that the Western Antartide , who poging on some in-submarine islands , is particularly rapid to the short leaves .
Equotes in six feet of the sea level , like in Groenland .
Sulla Himalaya , the third largest block of ice , you see new laghi , which few years ago .
40 percent of the population is going to get half of the world 's population .
Sulle Ande : this ice is the source of water source of this city .
The landed is increased .
But when you get diminuify , the same happens to water .
In California , the Sierra Nevada is diminured 40 percent .
The idricium is in crisis .
The predictions , as you read , are good .
The world 's secustoming for secustoming .
The environmental disasters are increasing up to a rhythm out of the normal and without precedented .
Four times over the last 30 years , the precedented 75 .
This is a whole thing is sustainable .
If you look at the context context they can see the consequences .
In the last five years , we 've added 70 million tons of CO2 every 24 hours -- 25 million tons in the ocean every day .
Look at the area of the oriental Pacific area , from the Americas , to the west , and on both both parts of the substant iny , where there 's a radical oxygen in the ocean .
The biggest cause of global warming , together to deforestation , which is 20 percent , is the use of fossil fuel .
The oil is a problem , and the carbon is even worse .
The United States is one of the two more emissions , together to China .
And he proposed to build a lot of other carbon .
But we 're seeing a direction change .
These are the anullated projects in the last few years and some green alternative alternative projects .
And so , there 's a very political lost in our country .
The carbon industry and oil industry have spent 250 million dollars in the last year to promote carbon , which is a oxymous .
That was a picture of me , I would remember something --
Virst Natal , in Tennessee , where I live , there was a loss of 3.8 billion lights lights .
Maybe you saw it on news .
This is the second biggest flow of last flow in America .
It happened around Natale .
The nalization of one of the carbon industry was this .
Video : Same : Seveluary coal is a kind of allegro and happy .
It 's abundant here in America , and it grow our economy .
Frosty carbon is increasingly clean .
It 's good price , and the workers are going to keep the stypend .
Al Gore : From here is a lot of the West Virginia .
The biggest mineral society on the mountains is Massey Coal . This is his administrator .
Video : Don Blankenship : Sarkenship , Nancy Pelosy Pelosy Pelosy , they don 't know what they 're talking about .
Al Gore : So the Alleance for Protextition of Clima has launched two campaign .
This is a part of them .
Video : Actor : Actor COALergy , we see the climate change as a sea serious seat to our business .
So , our priority is investing a big amount of money in a effort to make public and confused the truth and confused the truth of the carbon .
In fact , carbon is not sporite .
We think it 's clean -- it 's also a good profum .
So , not preocumate change .
Let me do it .
Video : Cbone : Carbone -- you 've heard a lot of them .
So let 's take a turn into a structure to the avaning to the horg as much carbon .
Straordinary ! The machines are a little rumorous , but this is the sound of the fuel technology of coal .
The carbon consumption is between the main cause of global warming , but the remarkable technology of coal that you see changes everything .
Do look at this : this is the hodiernal technology .
Al Gore : Instead , the alternative alternational security and the security of the national security .
Video : The America is in crisis ; the economy , safety , the national security crisis .
The file connects all : our dependence from fossil fuel combustible , like carbon fuel oil .
Now , there 's a new , audace solution to go out .
Repower : 100 percent of clean energy , in 10 years .
A plan to put America to work , to make sure , and help stop the warming warming .
Finally , a solution that bads to solve our problems .
Repower . Scover more .
Al Gore : This is the last .
Video : How much of the energy . It 's about require energy to America .
One of the fastest ways to bring it dependence to dependence from combustible to the planet .
Compared : The future is here . Vent , a new energy network .
Compars : Novi investment for a retribute ,
Comment : Repower America . It 's time to be realists .
Al Gore : A African proverbio says , " If you want to go fast , you go to fast .
If you want to go away , you go together . "
We need to go far , quickly .
Thank you very much .
Last year at TED , at TED , in the LHC .
And promise to get back to the way to get up to how the machine works .
So here I was . And for the ones that the other time there were no , the LHC is the biggest scientific experiment -- that we 've been trying -- 27 kilometers of circles .
His task is to reeing the conditions that were at less than a billion times a billion times from the beginning of the universe -- until 600 million times a second .
That 's just ambious .
This is the car under Ginevra .
We 're going to have these min-Big Bang in the relevening .
This is what I work . It 's called ATLALAS -- is about 44 feet .
This is a spectacular picture of ALALAS in built so you can see proportions .
Ten September last year we have accesum the first time .
And this picture was taken by ALAS .
It was because of immense festeggives in control .
It 's a picture of the first of particles that had done all the around the LHC , entering in collision , in a part of the LHC , and it spread particles inside the relevant .
In other words , when we saw that image 10 september , we realize that the machine worked , which is a great writing .
I don 't know if it was this to make us exultate more or this , when someone went on on Google and saw that the page was this .
That means we have had a cultural impact beyond .
And so , a week after , there was a problem with the car , just to these file here -- these fixed here -- these fixed .
These file flaps 13,000 print when the car works at the massix-powerful .
Now , the technical technical between you will look at the file and say , " It 's not true . I 'm physical . "
And they can do it because when they 're very freeful , they can be the superconvictions .
So , at least 271 degrees , at least 271 degrees , at least 271 degrees , these things can bring that running that running .
In one of the giuntures between the magneti magneti in the LHC , there was a fect fit to be a fed fabrication .
So the file surrounded , and the 13,000 practice suddenly met a electrical resistance .
This was the result .
Now , this is even more impressive if you think that these magneti fish more than 20 tons , and that they moved about 30 centimeters .
They 're damage about 50 magneti .
We had to take them , what we did .
We restinated them and upset .
Now they 're coming back to their place .
By the end of mark the LHC is going to be integral .
We 're going to access it , and we expect to get data or the bunch or the bunch of data , and we keep our adventure to find out what are the morning ning that are the universe .
Now , of course , these accidents reached the debate on value of science and engineering in the value of science and engineering in the front of science and engineering in the front .
I think the fact that it 's so hard , the fact that it 's the value of things like LHC .
I would like to conclude with the words of a English scientist , Humphrey , which , I think , in a defense of the inuseful experiments of his pupille , his clello , his clello , " Nist so much of the human mind as the renhy of the mind of science is defines , that the idea of science is definitely , that our trionfed to be able to be a whole new ,
Thank you .
I want to start asking you to start thinking about when , children , you played up with the morning .
As you get to get them and get them , and get them , and get them , you know , and you 're going to be able to think and solve problems and manipulating relationships .
The space reasoning is deeply connected to the way we understand a lot of part of the world around us .
So , from the useful use of our interaction with physical objects , together to my physical consultant , and my collaborator Jeevan Kalanithi , I started asking to ask , " And if , when we use a computer , instead of having the only one of the mouse as a pollen , as a digital pollen , we could actually trust a sweet with a desktop ,
and how do it is to our please ?
The question was so interesting that we decided to explore the answer , building the answer , building Siftable .
In a few words , a Siftable , is a great interactive computer as a biscoothing .
In a few words , a Siftable , is a great interactive computer as a biscoothing .
You can move them with your hand , they can see , " between them , " and they 're going to hear their movement and they have a screen and a wireless .
But in fact , they 're physical objects , like the morning , you can move it to be able .
The Siftable is an example of a new tools to manipulate the information .
And as they become more physicians , conscious , conscious of the movement , of other , and as they become more physicians , and other , how we move them , we can explore new and fun and fun and fun interaction .
I 'm going to start with some simple example .
This Siftable is configured to show video : if you 're going to stop it in a direction , video is going to rowth that if you 're going back to the other side .
These interactive rats are aware of other .
If you face them , they 're interested in what they 're going to them around .
If they 're surrounded , they can see it and they can do it .
If they 're surrounded , they can see it and they can do it .
They also have their movement and innicked movement .
We then realized that one of the interaction was that we can use common managed to the data , to example example , " a color as if it was a liquid .
In this case , we have three Siftable configured as a buch bunch and I can use them to the color in that central , where they mix .
and I can use them to the color in the middle of the central , where they 're missing .
We 're going to be too much , we can put a little bit .
There are also beautiful possibility of apprenticing , like language , mathematics and logic games where people can try to try to do things , and see the results immediately .
Now , I 'm --
This is a Fibonactic RS RS , I do with a program of equations .
Here we have a words of words that 's in the Scarabeo and Boble .
Pratically , at every turnal turnal , at every Siftable , Pratically , at every Siftable , Pratically , at every Siftable , and as you look for words , and you try to get it control of a dictionary .
And then , after about 30 seconds remissed , and you have a new lectity set and new possibility to try .
Thank you .
Here 's the children came to the Media Lab , I did in a way that trigging them and I went to a video .
They are very pleased .
And one of the interesting things that kind of appliance is that you don 't have to give people a lot of education .
You just say , " Compons of words , and they know exactly what to do .
Here 's here to other people try it .
This is our youngest tester , there 's the right .
It was actually wanted to impilling them .
They only were morning , for him .
Now , this is a appliation of a interactive cart .
We wanted to build a tool for the apprenticing of language .
It can put new characters in the scene , lifting Siftable to them .
It can put new characters in the scene , lifting Siftable to them .
So , it 's doing it .
Video : Sun is smile .
David Merrill : Now , she brought a treat .
Video : The treat the ran .
Bel work ! Yeah .
So , you get the Siftable and put together , and then then you can get the characters --
Video : Bau !
-- inventing your story .
Video : Hi !
DM : It 's a story with the open , and it can decide him how you want .
DM : It 's a story with the open , and it can decide him how you want .
Video : Very forth .
DM : The last example I have the time to show you is a tool , made of recent , to chpioning and execececececture .
It 's a tool , made of recent , to sample and exececececececutilized .
The Siftable here are aging sounds like the bass , and the battery .
Each of these has four different variations , and you can choose what to use .
You can also put these sounds in a sequence to get these pleasure .
And it just by doing touch a sound , and a sequence .
These are effects that you can control from the vial , like reverbero and the filter .
The attacks to a particular sound and then inclens to enjoy it .
And then there are the general effects as time and volume , who applied to the sequence .
Let 's look like it works .
Video : We 'll start putting a basic in two Siftable sequence , we 'll put it in a series , we add in a series , we add it , we add the other base .
Now I put a basis of the bottom line .
Video : Now , I add percussions --
Video : And now I 'll put the filter to battery , so I can control the effect from the vial effect .
Video : I can get fast the whole sequence of the whole sequence time by one side .
Video : And now I 'll add the bottom to give more expression .
Video : I can recombine the sequence to the flight .
So I don 't have to plan it before , but I can improvisate , and make it over a longer .
And now , finally , I can spend the whole sequence on the left , the Siftable to the Siftable .
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is to build new interfaces and more and more soembedded as our brain and body .
And today , I had time to show you one of the results of this path , and also some chance we try to bring out of the lab .
The concept I want to transmitted , is that it 's coming up to this new generation of designed to interacting with digital media , that will bring information in our world in the way we want .
Thank you very much .
I don 't see the hour with you .
I 'm a writer .
Scriting books is my profession , but it 's more than that , of course .
It 's also love and the fascination of my life .
And I don 't expect that it can change .
But , said , this is something specifically happened in my life and my career , who brought me to report the whole thing with this work .
The particular thing is that I recently wrote this book , this whoever called " Mania , " The Expept , " The diversof my precedented , for some reason came out in the world and became a great , and it became a great sensus , and it became a great senational sensus .
And the results is that everywhere is going to be now , people treat me as if I were convicted .
Really -- convicted , convicted .
They 're going to me now all worried and they say , " Don 't it to do it better ?
Don 't you feel that for life without being able to make a book that can important to be able to make a book that can important to someone ? "
that can be importance to someone ? "
It 's recertainly , you know .
But it could go worse , on the end I remember that over 20 years ago , when I started saying to people -- I was an adolescent -- I wanted to be a writer .
I was on the same reaction based on the fear .
And people said , " Don 't you get succeeded ?
Do you don 't care that the humiliation of refit .
Do you don 't care to do this to the whole whole life without nothing nothing else is ever going to be out and die on a cumulation of the wild to the bunch of bear , and you know , the failure ? "
Just so , you know .
The answer to all these questions is , " Yes . "
Yes , I 'm fear to all those things .
I always had fear .
And I also fear to many other things that people can 't have to be inguess .
As the algae and other things .
But , as it was about the writing what I thought and ask me , and I would ask for that ?
Is it rational ?
It 's a logical that anyone who has been expected by a job that you feel like to do .
But what is there is so particular in the impressive impress that it makes us nervous minute minute minds of the other career , not they do it ?
How father , for example , he was a chemical engineer and I don 't remember one in his 40 years of activity in his 40 years of activity that he asked if he had fear to be engineer ?
There was never -- that block of engineer John , how does it go ?
Don 't it work , you know ?
Onestly , chemicals as group have not certainly , in the centuries , drive to be alcolied to be alcolied maniaces .
We have a writers , we have enough to have this reputation , and not just writers , but creativity of any kind , we have this reputation of being huge instaable .
And it 's not something else that look at the trial of the magnify of the magnificments of the magnify , only in the 20th century , they die young and often .
And the ones that don 't have sound to look like to be really disfaced by their dungs .
Nman Mailer , before he died , in the last interview said , " Every , " Every book , killed me a little more extraordinary affermation about the work of their life .
But we don 't get it up , when we heard these things so long that we 've been very long that in some way we have completely interiorized and accepted the notion that creativity and suffering are somehow tired and suffering are somehow linked and the art , and then it will always be able to angoal .
And the question that I want to take all here today is : are you agree with this idea ?
You know , this thing -- because it 's also looking from a centimeter of a distance to me , it 's not good for this support .
I think it 's odious .
And I think it 's also dangerous and I don 't want to see perpetuated perpetuated in the next century .
I think it 's better to encourage our big creative minds .
And I certainly know , in my case -- in my situation -- it would be very dangerous to start sending out of suppoining , especially , you know , the circumstances are in my career .
It 's very -- I mean , they 're pretty young , I 'm pretty young , I have about 40 years .
I have still about four decades of work in me .
And it 's very likely that everything I writing in now , it will be judged by the world like the work that came out of my last book .
I 'm going to slavery , because we are all more or less friends here -- it 's likely to my shoulder .
Oh , Gesus , who thought !
You know , this is the kind of thought that leads a person to start behind the nine of the nine in the morning and I don 't want to do it .
I would keep doing this work that we love .
So , the question becomes , what ?
And so I think , after a lot of reflections , that the way to do to keep write is to create a psychological construct , OK ?
I have to find some way to find a safety distance between me , I 'm writing , and my natural anxxial rate that writing is going to get it . And , as I was trying to do it for the time , trying to find other society to find other society to find other time , trying to find other society to find other society , if they could have have have better and more healthy ideas and sane healthy and sane .
about how to help creative managing emotional risk of creativity .
And that research brought me to the Greek and ancient Rome .
Seguitees because it 's going to go back .
In the ancient Grek and ancient Rome -- people didn 't seem to believe that creativity self-invent from men , OK ?
And it was thinking that creativity was this spirit to be and that came to the men from a few people who were in a few surdistant and known , for distant reasons , for the distant reasons ,
The Great , they call these spirites are called demon .
Socrate , wonderful , believed to have a demon that wisdom wisdom .
The Roomes were the same idea , but they call that kind of spiried ,
That 's great , because Roomes didn 't really think that a genius was a specifically smart .
They thought that a genius was this kind of a divine entity that was living in the walls of a study of a artist , a little bit like the elpho Dobby , and who came out to see the job of the work of the artist and to models the result of the artist and models the result of that work .
Here 's the distance of -- here 's the distance of which I talk about -- that psychological construct that you protects you to protected from your job .
And everybody knew that it was how it worked , right ?
So the anti-artists were protected by certain things , like , for example , too much , for example , too much , not ?
If your work was exceptional , you couldn 't get all the deserve , all of you know that you 've been helped by this incorporeous .
If your failed work , it wasn 't your whole , right ?
Everybody knew that it was your genius to be a inable .
And so people han conceived creativity in Occcious for a long time .
And then the Renagenciment came and everything changed , and it was born , and we put the human being over the center of the universe on the middle of the universe on the windry and no longer to leave space .
This was the principle of the rational principles and people started thinking that creativity was completely from the ilight-shing .
And for the first time in history , you start to refly up to this or artist as a genius rather than a genius .
And I have to tell you , I think it was a big mistake .
I think I allow someone , a simple person to believe that being a recipient as a source , the essence and the source of all the mysteries divancy , creativity , unknowable and ethern is a very big file to give to fragile the human psychologist .
It 's like to ask someone to enjoy the sun .
Deform and destores completely the ego and creates all these ingestilifetime .
And I think it was this pressure that I had destroyed the styed in the past 500 years .
And , if this is true , and I think that is , the question becomes , and now ?
Can we do it .
Maybe I 'll go back to a more ancient comprehension of human and mystery .
Or maybe not .
Maybe we can 't cell 500 years of rational thinking in a degree talk .
And there 's probably people in the audience who would have legitimate to scientific sospects on the notion of , you know , they follow people to spend up the next fit of their projects .
I 'm going to not convince you all about this thing .
But the question I 'd like to ask is -- why does no ?
Why don 't you think that in this way ?
Because it 's more sense of everything that I 've ever heard to explain the exasperant imprevedibility .
A process that , as anyone who ever tried to do something -- so , it 's basically , you know , you 're not compored .
And , in fact , it can sometimes seemed to be completely paranormous .
I did this meet recently with the extraordinary poetry Ruth Stone , who has now 90 years , but he was a poetry for the whole life and told me that during his infants in the rural Virginia , working out in the camps , and he felt it , inside if a poetry , when a poetry was coming from the landscaped .
He said , he was like a fragorous train .
And that was coming roolding to her from the landscape .
He felt that , because he was going to get down the land under his feet .
He knew I had one thing to do that point and was , words , " to run a math like a math . "
And so he would correct home and she was sitting by this poetry , and it wouldn 't have any other card and a math and a math enough , while the traping traping , and it was a pitch for the page .
Sometimes he couldn 't be enough enough enough , so it would be fast , so he would correct and correcreceive and he would keep it in the house and she would keep rotolar through her , and she would continue to rot through the landscape , looking for , as she said , " a poet , and he would continue to , " another poet . "
And then there were no one -- this piece of the time I will never forget -- there were a moment when it was almost losing , OK ?
So , he was running home and he was trying to get her , and she was trying to get a math in the way , and then he said , that it was going , and then he said , that it was like if you fall the other hand and the steffed .
He used to cool the poetry from the coda and remaining it in his body and transcuting it on the page .
And in these cases , the poetry would be presented on the perfect page , but by the last word to the first .
So when I heard it , I thought -- it 's very except , it 's exactly the same same thing .
Not all of my creative process -- they 're not a conconconconconconconviction .
I 'm a mulo , and my way to work is ; you get up , and I 'm going to wake up and work and go over the goffly .
But even I , in my headphareas , I have striped against that thing , sometimes .
And I think that many of you have the han .
You know , even if the work and ideas were sent to me from a certain source , you can 't know .
And what is this thing is ?
And how can we relate it to it in a way that you don 't lose your head , but rather , what do you get healthy ?
For me , the best example of the most contemporary example I have is the musician Tom Waits , which I interviewed several years ago for a newspaits .
We were talking about this , and you know , Tom , for the majority of life is remarkable to the incarnation of the incarnation of the income , to try to control these species of impulses .
But then he invent , he cut , and one day , while she was driving on a car in Los Angeles , , he changed everything for him .
He was fast , fast and all of a tracks of this little framment of melody , who comes in his head as the inspiration , it 's an inspiration and it , you know , it 's wonderful , and it wants , you know , it 's wonderful , and it doesn 't know how to take it .
It 's not a piece of card , it didn 't have a matt , it has no register .
So he starts to hear this kind of old old anxioned up in this guy , " I 'm going to lose , and I 'm going to lose , and I 'm going to get a sessed sessed from this song .
I 'm not good enough and I can 't do it . "
And instead of going to go to the panic , he stops .
He was going to be able to be completely new .
And he just just the sky and said , " Scuses , I 'm driving ? "
" Who seems to write a song now ?
If you really want to exist , you get me a moment , when I can take care of you .
Other , you go to importunt someone else today .
You know , to disturbing Leonard Cohen . "
And his process changed after this .
Not work , the job was still dark as a always always .
But the process , and the fish anxiety that was required when the genius , the genius of him , the genius of him out of him , and he was going to get it back from where , realized that there was no thing , and he was going to be a whole thing and so so it was going to be a whole thing and then then remainted .
but you know this peculiar , wonderful bizarre collaboration between Tom and this strange and external and this strange and external and external and the external and external , but it was not Tom .
So , how I felt that story that I was also working to change a little way I was working and I was already saving and I had a time .
This idea , I was saved when I was writing , " Mania , " and fall in one of those cave of the disperation that we 're going to do all when we 're working on something and we can 't start thinking about something and we don 't start thinking about it .
Not only usually bad , right the worst book .
And I started thinking about thick this project .
But then I remind to Tom who was talking to the air and you tried .
So I stood up my face on the dark and I was committed and reached my common to a vacuum of the room .
And I said , " Sort , what , you know , you 're both knowledge , we know that if this book is not going to be brilliant , no ?
Because as I see you 're going to put it all I have , I don 't have this .
So if you want to be better , you have to be presented and do your part .
OK . But if you don 't do it , you know what , I don 't do it .
I 'll write the same because it 's my job .
And I 'd like to be recorded that I was presented that I was presented to do my part of , " Because -- at the end is so , OK -- -- you know , you know , in the end of the doubts , and music to sacred by the moon , and to the douter and to the stuff that would go on and hours to the stuff .
And they were always magnify , because the ballerins were professionals and were fantastic .
But every while , rarely , something happened , and one of these artists became transcendent .
And I know you know what I 'm talking about , because I know you 've all seen , at a performance so .
It was like if the time , and the dancer walk through a kind of land-up , and it wasn 't a different way of the solute , like 1,000 notes before , but everything was aligned .
And suddenly , not just appeared as a human .
But it 's on the divinity inside and the divinity of divinity .
And when this happened , when this happened , the temples , people knew what it was , they call it .
They were congave their hands and began to dog , " Allah , Allah , Allah , God , " God , " God , "
That 's God , you know .
Curious note -- when the Morororous Morororous Spain , preserent this habits and pronounced in the center , " Allah , Allah , Allah , " Ole , Allah , " Ole , " Ole , " which you can still feel in the corries or in the flamp .
In Spain , when a artist did something impossible and magic , " Allah , " Allah , " Allah , " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " Allah , " " " " " " Allah , " " " " " Allah , " " " " " " " " " Allah , " , " British , " , " Alah , " In Spain Spain Spain , "
And it 's great because we need .
But , the problem comes the day after , for the dancer , when you wake up and discovering that are 11 in the morning of Martedesday and last of God , there 's no longer .
It 's just a mortal with gran bad shink , and maybe it will never get to sell down to the height .
And maybe nobody will you have the name of God , and what does it have to do with the rest of his life ?
It 's hard .
This is one of the most painful recognized lization to make in a creative life .
But maybe it doesn 't have to be so angoal if you can 't believe , as well , as well as well as you can 't believe , as much as you 're from yourself .
But you know , you 're just going to be a prested data from a inimaginable source of this team that you have to go to someone else when you finished .
And , you know , if we think that 's all changes .
And so I started thinking about , and it 's certainly like I thought about several months during the workers of the book that I 'll be going to be on , the dangerous , he exploited , and then it followed my my great succeeded .
And what I have to keep telling me when I feel electured by this is , it 's not fear .
It 's not just your job .
Continua presentarts for your side , any can be .
If your work is dancing , ball .
If the divine , it 's assurd to you get a decide to leave a few kinds of marries , for a moment , you know , then , " Ole ! "
Other , you do the same dance .
And " Ole ! " You know .
I think and I should be teaching it .
" Ole ! " at you 're just for human and testing tale and testing tacts to make you continuously .
Thank you .
Thank you .
June Cohen : Ole !
As I 've already talked about some of these projects on the human genome , what can mean and discovery new discovery set of genes .
Now we 're starting a new path : we started digitizing biology and now we 're coming from that code , we 're coming into a new phase of biology , designing and synthize and synthizing and wintecectual .
We always tried to ask a big questions .
What is life ? "
We tried different approaches , reduced to the minims .
We 're digitializing from almost 20 years .
When we sequenced the human genome was going to move from the analome of the world 's biology in the digital world .
Now we ask us : can we regenerate life , or create new life from this digital universe ?
This is the map of a little organism , Mycoplasma genitalium , which is the species from the smallest genome between those who can authorem in the laboratory .
And we tried to reduce the genome to create a little bit more .
We can get eliminate a hundred genes of genes about about about 500 that are here .
But when we take a look at his metabolic map , it 's relatively simple respect to our .
I think , this is simple .
But when we look at all the genes that we can get , once , it 's very unlikely that this can bring a living cells .
So we decided that the only way to progree was synthesize this chromosoma in a way that could modify the components to bring some of these fundamental questions .
And so we started the adventure of the " Can . "
Can you get to make these big molecules that we never have been able to create these big molecules that we never have been able to make before ?
And , in case , we can make a chromosoma ?
A chromosoma is just a piece of inert material .
The speed that we 're able to digitize life is growing up to exponential .
Our ability to write the genetic code , instead , progreded , but it 's improving .
And our most recent results the results are exponential .
We started over 15 years ago .
The process required many passages , starting with a bioethical review before we started the first experiments .
But we found that synthesize DNA is very hard .
There are tens of thousands of machines in the world that are producing , the long DNA , long , long , and it 's a degenerative process : the longer longer is , the longer longer , there are .
So we had to develop a new way to assemble these framments and correct the mistakes .
And this is our first attempt , to start digital information of the genome of the genome of Phi X 174 .
It 's a little virus that kills .
We designed the fragments , effectuated the correction of the errors and get a molecule of DNA molecule .
The interesting part is when we took this piece of chemical material , and we put it in bacteria , and we put it in bacteria , and we put it in the bacteria .
The viral particles have then been released by cells , they 've come back and they destroyed the E.
I talked to recent a membranes of the oil industry is saying that they 're certainly compresed this model .
They have rice rice over you .
We think this is a situation where the software can really build its own hardware in a biological system .
But we wanted to do things biggest .
We wanted to build the whole chromosoma .
They 're over 580 mile thousand lectareas .
So we thought we build it in the cassets of the viruses , so that we can change the cassets to understand what are the components of a living cells .
The design is crucial , and if we start with digital information in a computer , these have to be very accurate .
When we sequenced this genome for the first time in 1995 accurategy was a mistake for every 10 mile .
We found out , we found , 30 errors . If we had used that original sequence we didn 't have been able to do it .
One part of the process is designing 50 leckments that are overlamong all the other segments of 50 letters to build underwater smaller to build subunity smaller than working together .
We make only a lot of the only one here .
You probably read that we 're probably read that we 're going to be in the filiguring .
Think of that , we have a genetic code on four letters : A , C , G and T.
Three of those letters put together with about 20 friend about 20 friend , and there 's a specific order to read for every friend .
So we can use genetic code to write words , no way , thinking .
What we did at the beginning was autographed .
Some of them have been delused by the fact that it wasn 't poetry .
We designed these segments to just uning them together .
There are a lot of them , and they put them up and put them .
And we started assemble with the parts , starting with segments from five to seven thousand letters , unended up to the segments of 24 thousands and and so it 's 72 to them until they get 72 mile .
And we have produced these segments in abundance so that we can recil them from being able to create an extremely robbads -- as you 'll see in a minute .
We 're trying to automatize the process .
So , this seems like the tabellon of a basket .
When we get these very long segments , over 100 mile , they will not grow much more directly in E.
It comes to the modern instruments of the modern tools of molecular biology .
So we 've been looking at other mechanisms .
We knew about another mechanism called a recombination omologa , which in biology is able to repair the DNA to unit can unit segments .
Here 's an example .
This organism , called Deinococcus radiodurs , can absorb three million radioduring .
You can see in high high square like his chromosoma is destroyed .
In 12 -- 24 hours , it 's replaced as it was before .
There are thousands of organisms that are able to do it .
These organisms can sit completely .
They can live under empty .
They 're absolutely sure life exists in space , and you feel to find new environments of water .
In fact , NASA showed that this is .
This is a picture of the molecule that we built by using these processes , just using the lights to the design of appropriate design segments .
The lights assemble them self-assemble .
This is not taken with a microscope with a microscope , but with a microscope .
It 's a big molecule that we can see it with a microscope .
These are pictures that cover a period of about six seconds .
This is the advertising that we did a little time .
They 're over 580,000 letters of genetic code .
It 's the biggest molecule of a defined structure ever created by man .
It 's got a 300 million molecular weight to 300 million .
If you stampassionate it with a cartoer , there would be 142 pages , it would take 142 pages only to transcer this code .
Now , how do we do it ? How can we get it ?
Of course , you 're tramed a virus is play .
It 's a little more complicated when you use bacteria .
It 's simpler , when it 's the eucariote cells like our : you can just extract the nucleus and put one else , and it 's basically the process of clonation .
In the bacteria , the chromosoma is integrated inside the cell , but we have recently demonstrated that we 're able to do a complete trapieces of a cell birthday , and then to another and activity it .
We clear a chromosoma from a microbial species .
The two are different as men from the topes .
We added some gene more in a way that we can decide what this chromosoma .
The skid , and then the skid with the enzymes .
And when we put it in the cells , and we put it in the cells .
And we started thinking that we couldn 't go beyond , but we tried to get there .
This is one of the biggest mechanisms of evolution .
We found that a second , and we 've added a second , or a third chromosoma somewhere , added in a second thousand new traits to the species .
So who think about evolution as a only gene , once you get modifies didn 't understand much much of the biology .
They 're going to be called the restriction enzyme , that they 're going to digerate DNA .
The chromosoma that was in the cells , it 's not one .
The cell phone chromosoma that we have inserit---short .
It 's expressed , and it recognized the other expressed as expressed material , and it 's got it , and we 've just recognized it with only the cell and the new chromosoma .
It became blue because of the genes we 've inserted .
And in a short leveral , all the characteristics of a species , went perse , and it turned out in a new species , based on the new software that we 've inserted in the cell .
All the protects have changed , the membrane have changed , and when we read the genetic code is exactly what we have transference .
Now , this may seem to be genetic , but altering the software , we can change the things in a way .
Now , I 've already explained that here doesn 't talk about genesesis -- but to progress from three million years and a half million years of evolution , and I said that maybe we 're going to create a new version of Cambrian explosion in which will be created new species on this process .
Why do that ?
I think it 's enough obvious when we think about our necessity .
We 're going to move from six and a half billion people in the next 40 years .
Just to give an example : I was born in 1946 .
Now there are three people on the planet for every none existing in 1946 .
We 're having problems now to find food , and it 's fresh and clean , medicine and well-and-a-half billion people .
It will be even more harder to do it for nine billion .
We use more than five billion carbon , and we 're 30 billion baris , more than 30 billion baris .
That means a hundred million barili a day .
When we try to find biological processes , or any kind of process to get them , it will be a huge challenge .
We have to keep the whole whole hemisphere of CO2 from these materials that goes into the atmosphere .
And at the day , thank you for the discoveries in the world , we have a database with about 20 million genes , and I like to think they are the design components for the future .
The electronic is only only one dozen of about components , and think about how many things are coming out .
Our limitations are constantly from the biological reality and our imagination .
Now we have techniques , because of these rapid synthetization , in fact , we can create a combinatory genomics .
We can build a big robot that can produce a million chromosomes a day .
Think about 20 million genes , so we can get these 20 million genes or to try to get the processes to produce either , new vaccines , new vaccines , we can change , and we can change , and we can change , and we 're going to make more biology now that over the last 20 years .
And it 's just a standard selection .
We can choose to survival for a chance of survival , chemical production or fuel .
This is a moment of some software programmed that we 're working for being able to seats and design species .
Well , we don 't necessarily know how it will be .
We know exactly what their genetic code .
Now we 're fourth concentrating on the high-generation carbons .
You see you also see that extract ethanol from gran , it was a bad experiment .
We have a second , the third generation will be going to be soon from sugar to sugar , as the either either or different kinds of butanol .
But the only way that biology can have a big impact without increasingly increasingly the cost of food and limitaren would transforming CO2 in matter before , so we 're working on the planet , and we think we 're working to design cells that can reach that the discover , and we think we have the first carbons of quarters in about 18 months .
The solar light with the CO2 is a metodo-- but in our discoveries , in our discoveries , we found different metods .
This is a organism that we described in 1996 .
He lives in deep ocean , about 2,500 feet of the deep-water temperature in the water temperature .
They create a metane from CO2 to molecular hydrogen molecular energy .
We 're trying to understand if we can incanalate CO2 , which can easily be transported tramed , to convert that CO2 in carburing , to drive this process .
So , a short path , we could be able to increase what the basic question is , " which is a life " is Noi , veramentally , we have the modth goal of replacing the whole oil industry .
Exactly . If you don 't do it from TED , where can you ?
It would be a main source of energy .
And then , we 're working for using the same metods to create instantanna vaccines .
You saw this year with flu , we 're always forth to flu , and it 's always going to find the right vaccine .
I think what you can change is building a combinable vaccines in ancient .
And that 's how the future could start looking at , now , the tree of evolution , now accelerating evolution with synthetic bacteria , arches , and finally initially cell eucariote .
We are so much from improve people .
Our discover is to make a long way to live long enough to try to get it . Thank you very much .
First of all , I 'll show you , the fastest , a new technology that we brought to Microsoft , following a year ago . This is Seadragon .
It 's a environment that you can interact is at the local level that you can interact with a huge amount of visual data .
Here we 're seeing a lot of gigabyte digital phoom with a kind of a sandwich and continuous , for a fast fast fast , avails that we want .
And it doesn 't matter how much much much much information that we see , how big the amount of data or the images .
Most of the digital photographs , but this is a scanning from the Library of Congress , and it recently reflies in the gamel of 300 megapile .
It doesn 't make any difference because the only thing that the prestation of a system like this is the number of pixel on your screen at any time . It 's also a very flexible architecture .
This is a book , an example of data not images .
This is the Casa desolate of Dickens . Every colonna represents a chapter .
To show you that it 's just about a tbook , and not images , we can do something like that , to see that it 's a real representation of the texture of the text , not a picture .
It could be a little artificial way to read a electronic book .
Don 't know the advice .
This is a more realistic example . It 's a number of the Look .
Every image is the beginning of a sexual .
And it gives you really pleasure and the beautiful experience of reading the real version of a magazine , which is for a quotidian , which is for a molteplice .
We also did something with the angle of this particular number of the Ladian .
We have created a high-resolution advanced , much more than you use in a normal advertising , and we 've inserted in the content .
If you want to see the character of this automobile , you can see here .
Or other models , or even the specific techniques .
And this really shows some of these ideas to eliminate the limits of space on the screen .
We hope that this means you put it up to a few hup and other things , and so much , you don 't have to be necessary .
Of course , the map is one of the most obvious applications for this kind of technology .
And on this is not going to lose , if we don 't have contribute to give them in this field .
These are all the streets in the U.S. overscan up on the NASA .
So , we 're going to go to something else .
This is now , it 's actually from the Web ; you can go to see .
It 's a project called Photosynthy , which combines two different technologies .
One is Seadragon and the other is a very interesting research in the computer computer that 's made by Noah Snavely , a student at the University of Washington , with Steve Seitz Seitz Seitz Seitz Seitz Rick . " A collaboration collaboration .
And it 's from the world on the web , managon from Seadragon .
You can see it when we do this kind of screreens , where we can go from a image to the other and have this kind of experience to the other , and have this kind of experience .
But the location of the pictures here has actually actually meaningful .
The algorithms of computers have recorded these images together , so that they corresponding to the real places that I imagine -- all of you just just picked up to the Grass on Montagues on Montagne Rockencies -- have been taken . Here you see the elements of a destroke , and these things have been linked .
I don 't know if I have time to show you some other environment .
There are some more space .
I want to go directly to one of the original data of Noah-- and this comes from a previous privious prototype of Photosynthtosynthesus that we 've done is really how to think that is really the key key key to show you that we 're really going to be the key key to the key to the world .
We had to worry about legal aspects and forth .
This is a reconstruction of Notre Dame pictures of Notre Dame pictures of Flickr . Basta digites , and you get pictures of the types of the trade , and you get pictures of these arants . And so , you get a picture of these arants that is discovery , that it 's discovered to this model .
So , they 're all images from Flickr and they 've been connected to this way .
And it 's possible to navigate this very simple way .
You know , I would never have thought of end up to work for Microsoft .
It 's very gratifying , you get this kind of acacovering here .
I think you can see that it 's a lot of different types of a lot of different ty-fotocell professionals : from the cell phones to the professional , together in this environment .
And if I can , I try to try to look at the most strange .
A lot of them are stuck by faces , etc .
Somewhere , you find a series of photographs -- here 's a series of photographs --
This is a poster of Notre Dame recorded .
We can go from the poster to the physics of this environment .
The essential point is that we can do things with social environment . This is now taking data from the whole memory data , from the whole memory of how it looks like the earth is , from the point of view -- and connects to all those data together .
All those pictures become connected together , more of the sum of the parts .
You have a model of the whole land that comes .
Think about this as a prolungation of Stephen Lawler on Earth .
It 's something that grows in complexity as well as people use it , and the advantages to increase the use .
Their pictures are husbed with inseries .
If you get someone comes the idea of contrast all of these sorts of saying , the name of Notter 's dral of unk Dimprovises , and I can use it as a point of all those data , and I can use it as a point to imgerms in that metaphorrim , using the picture of it , and have a cross-mooth experience of a cross-mooth , and cross-out experience of cross-mos-out of a cross-out of a cross-out of a cross-momoke .
Of course , a consequence of everything is extraordinary models of every interesting part of the earth , and it 's not just to see and achieved images and similar pictures and similar pictures and similar pictures , but from the collective memory .
Thank you .
Chris Anderson : I understand ? What your software is that your software is that you 're going to do is that at a certain point , in the next few years , all the photographs share going to share it from everyone in the whole world will be practice together ?
BAA : Yes . What 's doing is doing is actually discovered .
It 's creating the perlink , if you want , you 're in images .
And it 's doing it in the contained of images .
The thing becomes very interesting if you think about wealth of semantical information that many of these pictures are being able .
As you do a searches on the Web , you have a frase and the texture on the web page has a lot of information about the pictures of the pictures of the images .
Now , what happens if that pictures you 're connected to all your pictures ?
So the amount of interconnection and semantic and the amount of rich is really huge . It 's a classic effect . It 's a classic effect of the network .
CA : Blaise , it 's really unbelievable . Compliments .
BAA : Thank you very much .
One of the main pleasure when you travel and one of the ethnographics of ethnographics is the way that he has been able to live in the wind , you have the past in the wind , you get the past in the wind , you 're going to take it out of the plants .
Basti thinking that sciamans Jaguar viach beyond the Via Lattea , or that the Mef Mites are still himself colms of meanthropology , or in Himalayas , the buddists still the breath of the Dharma , but the idea that the world in which the world we live in a sense , but it 's just a sense , but it 's just a kind of reality , but it 's only a way ,
the consequence of a particular set of adaptative , that our estrace has done , well or bad , many generations .
And , of course , we all share the tracts .
We all all of this . We all promise .
We are subjects rates .
We have to death the inesorability of death , so we don 't surprising us if we 're going to --
We all have an art .
What it does is the particular rhythm of song , the rhythm of the dance of dance .
It doesn 't matter that are the Penan forests of Borneo , or the follow Vodoo 's the Curander 's Cururriers , or desert Kenya settle in Kenya settle in Sahara .
He was my journey companion in desert a month ago , or a yak in the liftor of the yak in the values of the world 's value .
All of these populations teaching us that there are other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , other ways of moving in the world .
And , if you think , you think , it 's a concept that it can give you hope .
And we get together , the myriades of the world creating a ragnoon of a spiritual and cultural life that is important for well-being like to the planet and it 's important to the well-being as biosphere .
And you can think about this reverse cultural rague as a ethnosphere and you can call the total thnosphere , and ideas , inspired , mites , ideas , inspiration , inspired , ideas , inspired to be from the human imagination from the alba of consciousness .
The etnosphere is the fantastic patriage of humanity .
It 's the symbbobox of what we can be as a inquisy species .
And because it was a gravously consumed as a bulphotoed as it has been very quickly .
Nobody biologist , for example , that would say that 50 percent of all species is on the orest exince , or -- in the most apocalm , or -- in the most apocalyptic -- in the field of biological diversity -- and you don 't even get close to the more optitimistic .
The index of that is , of course , the language loss .
When you were born 6,000 languages on this planet .
A language is not just composal by a vocabulary or a series of rules .
A language is the sprace of the human spirit .
It 's the half of the animal that the animal is in the material world .
Every language is a forest , a strong mind , a backin , a thought , a spiritual possibility .
And of those 6,000 languages , as we are in Monterey , at least half the half of the horecchies of children .
They 're not teaching kids , who means , that means , less you 're going to chbi , which are already death .
What is there more sad than being sad , the silence , of being the last talk to a language , of being the wisdom to the wisdom of the sad , or anticipate the promise of the children ?
This is a fitting in some of the world every two weeks , every two weeks , every two weeks , a year , a year , and it brings with her in the tommb silllabs .
And I know you 're going to say , " is it better ?
The world wouldn 't be a better place if we talk about all the same language ? " Benissim , then we talk all talk about yoruba . Let 's talk about the dotone-year-old .
Let 's talk about kogi .
You 'll be a supply , what it means we can 't talk about your own language .
And I 'd like to give you a trip through the thnosphere .
a little journey in the etnosphere to give you a hire of what we 're losing .
A lot of us forget that when I say , " different ways to exists , " intending very different ways of exists .
Let 's take for example , Barasana Barasana , in the snail , the populous anaaond , who creates the myth to come from southern river of snest in the west snest in the sandwich snaked .
It 's a popular people who can 't be able to distinguess the blue color from the green because the time you were identified in the forest , which depends on .
They have a strange language and a matrimonial , detection exogamia , " " You have to marriage a different language .
And all that has radical in the past mitological past mitological , yet , is that in these families , in which they talk about six or seven language because of marriages mons , nobody pricing ,
They 're limited to listen and then they start talking .
Let 's take one of the most interesting tribe with which I lived , the Waorani of Ecuador norter , an incredible popular , an amazing popular that had the first contacts in 1958 .
In 1957 missionaries have tried a construct construction .
They did down the photographs that they were going to get them into a lot of friendly , they were forest , and forget that this populous popular forest .
They have shown up the picture from the ground , they went to searches or a shape or a shape , and they were there , and they kw the role , and they kill the five missionaries with the lance .
But Waorans don 't kill the strange .
They kill them in their own .
On the 54 percent of the mortality was caused by their own .
We have been invitation at eight generations and we found two natural cases , and when we insisted to know , they had a lot of them was invectured so that he had died invectured , and then they kill it killed it . And then they kidnaked it .
The hunters were able to recognize the animal that was 40 steps and recognize the species .
In the early ' 80s , I 've been assigned a very interesting task when my professor of Harvard , if I wanted to go to Haiti to to sweet the babies of the power of Duvalier and Tonton Macoditon Macowon Macoditors and Tonton Macoditors .
To give a sense of a miracerous , I should have understand the Vodoo 's not magic .
It 's pretty much about a complex vision of the world .
Very interesting .
If I ask you to tell you about the world religions , what would you say ?
Cristianesimum , Islam , Buddhdism , Ebraism , etc .
A continent is always left out , thinking that the sub-Saharan Africa has no religious feels . And that 's yes and Vodoo is not else that the distilside of these religious concepts in a lot of profound out of the slavery .
What makes the interesting voodoo is the intended up between life and death .
So , you see they 're going to hide the spirits .
The spirits can invoced by the Great Acqua , they respond to the dance and they have temporary to the soul of the vial way that for a short moment , that for a short moment , the following the following becomes .
So , for this voodooists , you know , " You white , " you go to talk about God .
We give them in the temple and we forget God . "
And the moment you 're rid , is the spirit that you drive you , how can you do it ?
So you see these incredible events , they follow voodoo in the state of trance , that touches are impunted to a demonstration of the power of mind when it 's catalyzed in a state of extreme ,
And so , all the popular of which I lived the most extraordinary Kogi of Sierra Nevada Santa Marta , in the Santa Marta , in the sexectentrional Colombia .
It was a sending of the ancient civilization that once they were living on the caraibia in the conquest , the popular major , the popular sunk , the popular massive , which was retreated on the vulcycle .
In a continent macked continent smacked , this popular is never conquisted by Spanish .
But now , they 're governmented by a clero , but their formation is so extraordinary .
The young people follows are taken out of the families to three or four years , and live secregated in a world made of buy and shadows in a world that 's made of a glaciers for 18 years .
Two periods of nine years choices to reproduce the nine months of management that transformation that transformation in the user of the mother , now are metaphically in the uteral Grande Mother .
For that time , they 're accultured to values of their society , values that their prayers and only their prayers are prayers to make the concerned balance -- or to say the equilibrium -- or to say the equilibrium .
The term of this initiation , they 're suddenly landed out and for the first time in their life , at the age of 18 years , you see an alba . And in that moment , when the sun is the first bunch value , when the sun value is conscious , all of the splanded up , all that they 've learned in theory is constantly put it back and says , and says , says , "
" Where ? Proprise as I said .
It 's amazing . Now it 's now to you protect it . "
They call them more brothers and say that we , and they say that we , the minords , we are the destruction of the world .
This is very important .
When we think about the populations and the environment and the invote of the noble story , which is a razau and the old story of wild , which is a razer , and we call Thoreau and we say that these people are closer to the Earth .
The popular of the wouldn 't be feeling .
There is no space for these things in malaric palual palual winds of Tibet , but thank you for the time and the ran , and they created a mystics of the Earth is not about not concept of essercially ununununununclear , but on a very much closer , but on a very untuition of human consciousness .
What does that mean ?
It means that a little bit of the Ande who grow up grew up to a spirit of Apu who will leave his destiny to be a depth , and it will be a different human being a deep-different relationship with the mountain that place to a mountain different , with a mountain of Montana who grow up a mountain is a friend of rocks that a mountain is a friendly different rocks .
That 's the dimora of a spirit or a mineral cuts is irrelevant .
What 's interesting is the metaphor that defines the report between the individual and the natural world .
I grew up in the forests of British Columbia credying that forests to be cuted .
And that made me a human being different from my friends Kwauters who believe that the forests are the dise of Hukuk and the bats of the paradise and the bis historic and the spirits that live in the Hamatsa and the spirits that they live in the Hamatsa .
If you start looking at that these cultures can create different reality , you can start to understand some of their own sensional discoveries . We take this planning .
I 've taken this picture to aprile in the nordoccccies .
Mayahuash , the most powerful psychcover , the most powerful psychcotive repertoire .
What makes it fascinating the ayahuash is not the potential of the substance of substance , but his elaboration . It 's composition by two elements .
On one hand , this lian lian lian lian of beta-carboline , harmful and harmful , harmful and , slightly trainogenic and a slightly horrise .
And then , by the one plants has a blumn smoke that altery , but it 's measured with the leaves of a coffee family , said Psychotria , of coffee family said Psychotria review of coffee .

And I think , my tesis , you can 't go to these trippamines as hallucinogenous because if you can 't tell anybody to be trained .
It 's possible to be able to be in the horally , if they 're going to get the MAO .
Now , the beautiful carboline : Is Is that are in this lian lian ifth of MAO , the same kind of necessary to get trippamines . The question question is the question of spontaneous , like these people are there are two dealing of plants , how do they do these popular people have no sign , but if you combine in this way , they create a biochemical version that is sum that it 's soft version of the parts ?
We use the big euism and the mistake of the proof of the proof and error , that can reveal .
But if we ask the Indians will tell us , " The plants will tell us . "
What does that mean ?
This tribes , Cofan , has 17 variety of ayahuash , who are distinguess in the forest , and that our eyes would get in the forest species .
If you ask them , how they get stucklats , they 'll tell , " I was going to understand it about plants , and you know , you don 't know everything ? " I said , " No . "
The solution is : take the 17 variety in a night and every single downnnice will be with a different tone .

In fact , the 20th century , in fact , it won 't be remember to his drives or the innovations , but rather as the thing that we stopped and it actively or acceptively accepted or acceptively or accepted , or accepted , and it is not the change .
All the cultures through the centuries have been involved in a dance for new possibility .
And the problem is not technology .
The Sioux Indians have no stopped to be Sioux when they put up in the arc and they have no stopped in the horse and caves .
It 's not the change or technology that threatening the integrity of the etnosphere . It 's the power .

As you know the genocide , the physics of a popular , is a universal level , but the witem , the destroy of a popular life , not only is not convicted , but addicted in certain environments , because it does part of the development .

where wisdom of all the population can contributed to our well-being collective well-being .
Thank you .
I 'm going to talk about some things that I wrote in this book that I hope I 'll be a little bit about the connections , in case not notice .
I 'd like to start with what I call the official dogma .
The official dogma of what ?
The official dogma of all the Western industrial dogma official dogma official dogma , " If we want to massive to our citizens . " " " The way to do it is massive to do it is massive to do it is massive to be . "
The reason is , from one hand , in fact that freedom is in itself a value , is a value , is useful , essential for human beings .
On the other one is in fact that if we are free , each of us can act for the whole thing that massive to do everything that massive to do , without no one that we decided in the name .
The way to massive freedom is massive to be the choice .
The more choices are , the more choices are , and more , and more , is their weller , the more of the freedom , the most of the well-being .
This , I think , it 's so deeply roaded in society that nobody would be to put it in doubt .
And it 's also roaded in our lives .
I 'll show you some examples of what progress has made possible .
This is my supermarket . It 's not particularly .
I lose a simple note about condition for saved .
In my supermarket , there are 175 , without contact 10 variety of extrave the 10 variety of the extraverage , and 12 aceters that you can buy it for a huge number of condition of conditions in the increscement of the 175 proning is your degrees .
So that 's the supermarket .
And then you go to the store store to buy a stereo : casse , CD lector , radio , piahand , practice , left-hand , the print .
And in this single core store , there 's a big number of audio components .
We can do six million and a half million different combinations , using the components that there are only a store .
You have to admit that there is a lot of choice .
Other fields : the world of communications .
And once , when I was a child , you could get all the telephone services , at the path that were fornites from Mom Bell .
It was a phone , you didn 't buy it .
A consequence of that , the next one was that the telephone never breed .
These days are gone .
We have a variety of newspaper , especially between cell phones .
Here 's the cell phones of the future .
My favorite is the in the middle , MP3 , cuts , and forced to the bin and force for the Bulele .
If you don 't have seen it in the store under home store , you 're very sound .
And what happens is that people go into the stops and make this question . And you know what the answer is , " No . "
It 's not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn 't do too much .
So , in other aspects of life that are much more important than aquists , you green the same explosion of choices .
Axistence : it doesn 't happen to the United States that you go from the doctor and the doctor you have to do .
Instead , you go to the doctor , and the doctor says , " OK , we could do A , or B , " A has these benefits and these risks . What do you want to do ? "
You say , " Dotore , what should I do ? "
And the doctor says , " A has these benefits and these sauce , B has these benefits and sons . "
" What do you want to do ? "
And you get ribat , " Dotore if she was me , what would you do ? "
And the doctor , " But I 'm not . "
The resulted is called the malutomy of malutomy , expression that makes it look like a nice thing .
But it 's not that a move the weight and responsibility to make someone someone knows something , is the doctor , to someone knows , and it 's a double-cerly , and it 's not a customer , so not in the condition to make decisions the patient .
There 's a huge marketing of pharmaceutical products , direct to people like me and you , that if you think there 's no sense , because we can 't buy them .
But if we can 't buy them , why do you get them ?
The answer is that they want to the morning we call the doctor to ask them to change the rich .
What of this fundamental as our identity is our identity is a question of choice , as you see in this vignel , " We don 't want to force the children . " We 're going to not to get the right time , " we don 't get any more a identity : we have to invent .
And we can reinvented how many times we get there .
That means that every morning , you have to be decided that kind of person wants to be .
It was that you have the family and marriage , a time perspective , a common perspective for anyone , it was that there was a soon as possible , and it started to make the most soon possible .
The only real choice was with who , not when , and less what do after .
And so , it 's really about it .
I teach students , very smart students , and I do their 20 percent in less than a time .
And it 's not because they 're brilliant , not because they are less diligent .
but why are they impensiered , I mean , " Would I get marries or not ? "
" Would I get married to think before ? "
They 're interrogatives .
And they try to answer these questions , even if this untough is not to do the compete that I 'm going to check and not get a beautiful vote to my examples .
And they have to do it . They 're important questions .
Now , the work : we are lucky , like Carl underneath , because technology allows us to work every minute , every day , from every day , from every day , from every day , from every day , from every day , from every day , from every day , from every day , from every day , on the planet , except that Hotel Randolph .
And so I 'm talking , there 's a angle , and I won 't tell anyone , where the WiFi works .
I don 't tell you , because I want to use it .
What does that mean , this incredible freedom of choice that we have to keep on , continuously deciding , continuously , if we have to work or not .
We can go to see our son player to play hot , with the cell phone in a pocket , the Blackberry in the other , and the news , typically , on the ginockberry .
And even if they 're all spent , every minute that we see our son is also asking , " Did you answer to this call ? "
" Did you answer this email ? "
And even when the answer is , " no , this makes the experience of your own son 's partners , very different from what it would be in other conditions .
So , from any part , we look , little , things , big , materials and life , life is a question of choices .
And once the world was this : Ovreal , there were some possibility , but it wasn 't a question of choice .
The world today looks like this : The dilemma is , " Is it a positive thing , or negative ? "
The answer is Same : Same .
The lated positive . We all know , so I 'll talk about negatives .
And this is a little two effects of negative effects on people .
The first , a paradox , is that it produced paralysis that it produced .
With a lot of options between which choices , becomes very hard to do it .
I give you an example : a study conducted on planning of volunteer .
A colleague has had access to the Vanguard data , the giant source society , with about a million , with about a million customers in 2,000 companies .
What she found is that for every 10 solutions that are offered in the most , the percentage of the fabesion , the percentage of two percent .
With 50 fourth four-offer-fourth falls , at least than it 's available . Why ?
Because with 50 sources between which choices , is sically hard to decide , and choice is a lot of deciding , and choice is remajor .
And I think of course , and I think , tomorrow , and of course , and of course , I never get .
You know , it doesn 't mean that this work from old people will eat food for the people will not have enough money , it 's so hosticks , it also lose the decision is so that it lose the funds of the dators of work .
Don 't participating , they 're losing until five dollars a year from the dator of work , which would be very much disposed to be .
So , the paralysis a consequence of having too many choices .
And I think it makes the world like that .
" And to finish , for ethernity : keternal , sensing or maion ? "
You would take the right decision , if it 's for ethernity , is it ?
You don 't want to choose the wrong wrong , and you don 't want to choose the wrong condition .
So this is the first effect . The second is that we also have to avoid paralysis and make a choice , at the end , we 're less , we were made of less options in which choice as we were as a resherent options .
And this for different reasons .
One of these is that with a lot of people who choose , if you buy a bought to a and not perfect , it 's easy to imagine that you could have been better . And what happens is that it would be better . And what happens is that the alternative to imagine , and the repair the soft is that the alternative of choice , and the repair the soddisfresh the soddisfening of the rise of the resdatisfation ,
And when it was a very good decision .
And so , there 's more choice , it 's easier to disappear than any detail that it is unlike the option of choice .
And also , there is what economists call .
Dan Gilbert has very well survey , like the value that we do things depends on what we confronted them .
And then , when there are lots of options , it 's easy to represent the characteristics of the existics of the options of the options of the options that you 're choice .
Here 's an example . I 've all been in New York .
But that 's probably what you would probably think .
There is this copy in Hamptons .
A place of lussian .
It 's all about splendied . It 's all about them .
Not nothing . But what he thinks is , " Well , the reason , " Well , the obvious , it 's Agom . "
" All my neighbors in Manhattan are on . "
" I could talk about it right in front of the home . "
And it goes two weeks , you see on the idea that 's losing -- every day -- the chance of parking where it wants .
The constoopportunity diminufacturing the satifation for what we have , even when choice was excellent .
And the most of the options that we have to look , the more the characteristics will be going to be able to expensive .
Here 's another example .
This is telling us a lot of things .
It 's about living the moment , and maybe live slowly .
But the most important point is that anything you choice , you get down to not do other .
The things that we don 't choose to be a lot of attractive , that can make less attract what we do .
Third point : spiral growing of expectations .
I tried it on my skin buying a new couple of jeans .
I 'm almost always jeans .
And once the jeans were just a guy , buy , and they were sold besty , and they were ununexpected , just after having them a lifesty , and they were working on a lot of times , they started going .
So , I went to buy a couple of a couple of a few months when the old people were gone , and I said , " I need a couple of jeans , this is my cutter . "
The committed me said , " Li wants slim , and fit , and fit ? "
Would you want to the cernian or the bottons ? " Stonewashed or " acidlaved ? "
" Look , " Han you want to be layed ? "
" Sotto take them a little baby ? Bla bla blah blah . " Continuated to get it .
I was sleep , and after a little bit , and after a little bit , " I want the guy that -- that was the only guy , " he had no idea what it was , so for a time , so for a time , I tried to have a jeans , and then I 'm out of the wear jeans that I 've ever had .
It was the massive . With all that I had the best .
But I felt out worse .
Why ? I wrote a whole book to understand it .
The reason I was worse is that with all that choice was that with all that choice was very high , jeans had to be perfect .
I didn 't expectations . I didn 't expect to wait for me about that , when there was a guy , but when it saw 100 different steps , like , at least a guy had to be perfect .
What I had bought was good , but not perfect .
After I had paragoned that I was trying to get to expectation .
The adds of options in life doesn 't do that increasingly expectations that are respected to the excellent of the same .
And this will be protend to be disfacing , even when the results are good .
Nobody in the world of marketing , it realized .
Because if they knew , you wouldn 't know what I 'm talking about .
The truth looks more about this .
" He was better when it was worse . " The reason that was better when it was worse is that when it was worst , when it was still possible to meet the surprised .
Over , the world we live in -- opulents , industrialized , industrialized citizens with expectancy , the massive that we can hope is that things are at the height of expectations .
You never have surprised pleased because your expectations , my expectations , and it 's unexpected .
The secret of happiness -- what you 're here -- is , " Basically expectation . "
I mean , little wholeless , little whistic moment -- which are really married and my wife is really amazing .
I couldn 't do it , I couldn 't have any better , I didn 't have any acked .
But it 's not always a bad thing is .
And finally , a consequence of buy jeans when there is just that kind of jeans is that when you 're not satisfactory , and ask you , " Why ? "
" Who is responsible ? " , the answer is clear .
The world is responsible . What could you do ?
When there are hundreds of kinds of jeans , and you buy a satisfactor , and ask you who is the responsible , it 's the likely clear , that the responsible is you .
You could have done better .
With hundreds of variety of variety available , there are no scan for the insuccess .
So when people take decisions , even if the results is alid , they feel satives , they 're sdiscut and they give the colth .
In the last years , the depression is exploded in industrialized world .
I think a significant factor -- not the only one , but important -- of this wave of depression is that people have experiences because standard experiences because standard are too high .
And when they have to explain this situation they think that the colpe is they think that colth is .
So the final results is that we 're better , objectively , but we feel worse .
Let me remember you .
This is the official dogm , what we all take for good and it 's completely fell . It 's not true .
There 's no doubt that a little bit of choice is better than having any of them , but it doesn 't really hold , but it doesn 't really want to have a little bit better .
There 's a critical value , I don 't know what it is .
But I 'm sure we 've been there for a piece of a piece where we 're improving our life .
Now , from the point of political view -- I almost finished -- from political point , the nocction is the follow .
What it allows this is in industrial society is the rich material remarkable .
There are many places in the world , and you know , you know , where the problem is not that they have any choice .
The problem is that they have too much .
So the factory I 'm talking about is a males of a modern exclusive , requququest of Western society .
And what does does depress and angry is this : Steve Levitt you talked about how much much much those expensive and discoveries of the texture of money is inuseful . It 's a sprrite of money .
I mean that these choices , complicated and avoid available , it 's not just unuseful .
I 'm a deleterie .
They do them stay worse .
If a little bit of what in our society is going to be reversed in those where people are people are too few possibilities , it would not just be their life to improve , but our life .
This is what economists call a paretian improving improvement .
A redistribution redistribution is all right -- not only to poor -- because of this choice in excess that we get us .
And so , you can get it out , you can become all that you want . "
You , you think , you 'll think , " But what does it create that fish ? "
" It 's obvious that you can 't get anything in a glass . "
" A castrated , a remarker vision , a limited vision --
and I 've interpret it so , at the beginning .
But then , I realized , instead , I realized that that fish knows the long knows the long .
Because the reality of the facts is that if you send in frantums , so that , " everything is possible , " you can 't get the freedom .
If you break the box in a way that all the diminumining satisfaction .
You get the paralysis , and you reduced the well-being .
Everybody needs a sphere .
This is almost certainly too much much too close , maybe even for fish , and certainly for us .
But the absolutely unclear symbolic symbolic and , but , for the ruin the same .
Thank you .
