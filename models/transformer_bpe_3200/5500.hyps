The year year I showed these demonstring demonstring that the club cold . And for almost three million years of the United States , who had the size of the United States , is restreet of the United States .
But it 's a lot of the problem of the problem of the problem because it doesn 't have the ice of ice .
The glacial glacial artical is , in a sense , the heart of the climate system .
It 's a winvers , and you ritizen .
The next next diapositive will be a fastonishing the last 25 years .
The ice account of the red .
So , you see , you 're going to go to the blue .
So , this is the ice in the ice , which you 're ritizen .
You can see the cosidn said , the cosidgn , is how the blood , which is how the blood of the body .
In 25 years , it 's past , so it .
This is a problem because the recenter is the terrom problem , where we 're enormous amount of carbon where there are enormous amount of carbon , they 're transforming , they 're transformed in the microbes .
Right to the totality of inquing , the very instrument , that 's a global warming , that amount of not all .
In some lagey profound in Alaska a metan is already rebulate of the water .
The professorse Katey Walter of Alaska is in Alaska , is a team of a bottom .
Video : Wow ! I 'm well . I 'm well . The question is if we 're going to be .
A reason is that this remarkable to the GGenland .
This is a glacial regime .
I had never been to reach them to be a similar .
This is the Kangerlussuaq , in the suit , in the Groenland .
If you want to know how to the level of the ice for the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice , where you reach .
These are going to be aumenting .
The other part of the planet : Antartide , the most blowever , the most blowever .
The month , the month of the scientists have dichieved that the ice of ice is in negative , and the Antargument , which Antargument , is particularly a smarine , is particularly in the wind .
Eval , six feet of the level of the acque , like Groenland .
Sull Himalaya , the most big block of ice , you see new lagey , who were glaciers .
The 40 percent of the population of the population of water .
Sulle Ande : this ice is the source of water is the source of the water .
The landed is aumented .
But when I dididies , the same way to the water to the water .
In California the neve on Sierra Nevada is diminusususuity .
The backins are in the crisis .
The prevision , as you know , I 'm saving .
The growth of course , in the world to a remarkable remarkable .
The disaster is disasterern n n n n the normal and without precedent .
Four times more numbers in the last 30 years ,
This is a andscape of all insustainable .
If you look at the context of the context , if you can see the consequences .
In the last five years we add to 70 million of CO2 every 24 hours -- 25 million of CO2 -- 25 million tonong every day .
Look at the area of the Pacific area , from the human human human human human beings , to the parts of the continent , where there is a very much impoverty , where there is a very much image of the ocean .
The most of the rewarming , with the global rewarming , with the deforestation , is the 20 percent , is the use of cool .
The oil is a problem , and the carbon is even worst .
The United States is one of the United States is a two countries with the most emissions , together to the Cina .
And it was propond of a carbon .
But we 're going to be a changing .
These are the projects in the last years and some of the last years and some of the alternative of the last years and property .
And so , there 's a lost in our Paese .
The carbon of the carbon of oil , they speso 250 million dollars in the last year to promomomote the carbon , which is a oxygggass , which is a gold .
That 's the image I remember something --
I think Natal Natal , in Tennesis , where I think , there was a perdent of 3.8 billion land-dollar .
Maybe you 've seen on the nobody .
This is the largest as a very much more flying in America .
It 's happened around Natal .
The advertiser of one industry was this .
Video : I 'll be a baby , it 's a kind of a allegro and happy .
It 's a walk here in America , and it 's growing our economy .
Frosty the carbon is more ,
It 's a good price , adorable , and they work .
Gore : So , the Gore : So , the Gore Virginy .
The most society is the most society on the mountain is Massey . This is his friministrator . This is his friministrator .
Video : Don Blankenship : I 'll be a money -- Gore , Nancy Peleef , Harry Reor -- not to what they 're talking about .
So , Gore : So the Gore : So the Gore 's the Clima has two campaid .
This is a part of them , a part .
Video : Acore : Alil COALergy we see the climate change , as a sery of our business .
For this is our first lost is investing a lot of money in a lot of money in a lot of money in a foref , and confused the verity of the carbon .
In fact , the carbon is not sporite .
We think it 's a bablived -- it 's a good hour .
So , not precucucucumous change .
Let me do do it .
Video : Carbone : Carbone , you 've heard -- you 've heard about it .
So we do a lot of love to a structure to look at a building to the carbon .
Straordinary ! The cars are a little bit .
The consumers of the carbon is between the main of the major the global warming , but the remarkable of the carbon that you can see all .
You have a focus : this is the odiern technology of the carbon .
Gore : I mean , the alternative positive is connette to the economic question and the security of the security .
Video : The climate is in the crime ; the economy , the economy , the climate crime , the climate mate cripes .
The first thing that we put all the connection of all : our dependence of the coal , as the carbon , and the oil oil .
Now , I 'll be a new , audace ,
Repower : 100 percent of energy energy , in 10 years .
A plan to reput America to work , to make us more sure , and help us to stop the global warming .
Finally , a solution that we do our problems .
Repower . Scoprice .
Gore : This is the last .
Video : I 'm going to reporting energy to America .
One of the most ways of the most ways of the most ways to the end of the most ways to kill our planet .
I 'm going to be : The future is here . I 'm here . It 's a new energy .
Compars : Nusual investment for places to work for places of work .
Can : Repower . It 's time to be realists .
Gore : A old , I 'll go to the Gore African African , " If you want to go to the solar .
If you want to go back to the way , you go together . "
We have to go back to the way , we have to go to .
Thank you very much .
The year year at TED fer .
And you 're going to go to to the car .
So , I think about the time . And for the other time , there were , the LHC is the most experiment -- 27 kilometers of the conference .
His to reach the conditions that were presents that were in less than a million times at the beginning of the universe -- until 600 million times a second .
All right .
This is the machine Ginevra .
We have a a bank these min-Big Bang in the reserved .
This is what I work . It 's called ATLAS -- it 's larger and has a diameter of 2ers .
This is a picture of ATLAS in building so you can notice the proportions .
The 10 settember of the last year we have access or the car for the first time .
And this picture was called ATLAS .
It was because of the immense of control .
It 's a picture of the first wrote that had done everything the LHC , I went into the LHC , and I spend , with a part of the LHC , and spend particles in the role .
In other words , when we see that image 10 settembs , we realized that the machine , which is a great vitten .
I don 't know if it was to do it to do more , or this , when somebody went on Google , when somebody went on Google and I 'm going to be this .
What means we had a cultural impact cultural impact .
I 'm a week later , there was a problem with the machine , I had to have this fix here -- these fixes .
These are a 13,000 practice when the machine works , the massive of the potential .
Now , the technicians in you look at the children and say , " It 's not true . I 'm not not not true . "
And instead can do it because when they are very cosiddle .
So , at least 271 degrees , a temperature , to a temperature of the space of the stars , these kids can reporting .
In one of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the faby .
So the fix of the fix , and the 13,000 practice , and 13,000 practice .
This was the result .
Now , this is more than you think if you think these magnetic networks , if you think that these magnetic networks .
They 're just just about 50 magnetworks .
We had to have to go to , what we did .
We repressed and they were .
Now they 're going to go to all the land .
Entrust the end of the LHC is going to be a new integror .
We 're going to access , and we 're going to do the data or the right right or the lab or , and we continue to find what the morning is the morning that the universe .
Now , of course , in a certain way , these incidents , these incidents are the debate of science and the engineering of the science and engineering . It 's easy to be able to context .
I think the fact that it 's so hard , the fact , the fact , I think , it 's the value of things like the LHC .
I would like to go with the words of a Inglany , Huhrey , which , I think , in the defeny , which , I think of the inutionary of his own own own own own own own own , his own own own , said , " Night is dangerous to be a human human human human human human human human human mind . "
Thank you .
I want to start to ask you to you you , when kids , kids , play the morning , and the morning .
And so , you know how to reach them , and they 're going to take them , and we 're going to learn , and we 're going to be able to think and reporting the relationships .
The reasoning is profly connected to the way we understand that we understand the world in the world .
So , from information , by the end of our interaction with objects , with objects , with my conflict Ps , and my conflict . And when I started me to ask me , " And when I started to ask me , " And if we 're a computer , when we 're a computer , as a digit , as a digit , as a digit , we 're going to be a digit to be a digm , you know , you know , you know , I 'm going to be a very much to be a little bit about the hands ,
and siststly , it would it to our result ?
The question was so interesting to exploring the answer is to exploring the answer , it 's the Siftable .
In a few words , a Siftable computer interactive , as a great discover .
In a few words , a Siftable computer interactive , as a great discover .
And you can move with the hand , they can see , " I see " between their own , they 're going to be a screen and a screen .
But sound , I 'm objects , they 're objects , as the morning , you can move to be able .
The Siftable is the example of a new ecool system of the tools to make information information information .
And the hand that 's going to be more physical , consciousness , and the other , and the other , and the most physical movement , of how to move the movement , of how we can exploring new new and different things .
I 'm going to start with a simple example .
This Siftable is configurate to show the video : if you 're in a direction , the video video , the video video rich , if you walk back .
These are all interactive interactive are consciousness .
If you 're interested in , they 're interested in what they 're going to go around .
If they 're consciousness , they can do it a little bit .
If they 're consciousness , they can do it a little bit .
They also have the movement and inination .
We have to realize that one of the interested in the interaction of the interaction of the common data , to the common data , to the most of the common .
In this case , we have three Siftable , we have three Siffly , and I can use them to the color , where you do it .
and I can use them to the color in the central , where they do .
If we can go too , we can put a little bit a place .
And I 'm also beautiful chance to appreneurs , like language , and the mathematics and games where people can try to be able to do things to see the things that can be able to see the immediately .
Now I 'm --
This is a sequency of Fibonaccount that I do with a equations .
Here we have a game of words that is a half a half of Saaahead and Boboble .
Pratically , every turny , you get a literary literary case of every turny , Pratically , at every turny , and the day of the Sify , and as a certain who who who are compories of the compories .
Then about 30 seconds of the resmiss , and you have a new moved of the millions of provide and new chance to try .
Thank you .
So here 's how to the kids come in the Media Lab , I did I did it , and I 've done a video .
They are liked very much .
And one of the interesting things about this , which is that not to do you to get people to you people to get to a lot of the things .
You 've got to say , " Compmps , " and they 're going to do .
So here 's how many people who try to do .
This is our kid to go to the most young , there 's the right .
It actually wanted to just impacting them .
They 're just just morning , for him .
Now , this is a application of a interactive interactive .
We had to build a tool for the language of language and said , " The Felix .
It can be able to new characters in the sorts of their own own own own .
It can be able to new characters in the sorts of their own own own own .
So , it 's doing it , it 's doing the sun .
Video : The sun is sun .
David Merrill : Now he took a treators in the scene .
Video : The treators .
Bel work !
So , schooting the Siftable and put it .
Video : Bau !
-- I inventing their story .
Video : Hao !
DM : It 's a story with a story with a story with a walk .
DM : It 's a story with a story with a story with a walk .
Video : Vola to the way .
DM : The last example I 've got the time to show you a tool , I made a tool , to do it .
It 's a tool , I made a tool , to pay and exef music .
The Siftable here is the bottom , the bacteria .
Everyone of these four different variations , and you can get to you what you use .
You can also instrument to a bit these supplies in a consciousness to your liffy .
And I 'm going to be doing a baby , " and a " " " " " " " " " "
These are actually going to control from the vious , as the reverbs and the trum .
It 's a particular suit , and then they 're inlesson to be able .
And then there are the general , as time and wanted to do , and they 're going to do it .
Let 's go .
Video : I 'll be a bottom in two Sift-pay in two Siftable systems , the systems , we add the other bottom .
Now I put a bottom line .
Video : I add to go to percent of the way --
Video : I 'll go to the bacteria , so I can control the bacteria , so I can control the effect from the vision .
Video : I can 't be a fast to the interaction to the intersequence , or another side .
Video : I 'll be going to be to the bottom to the bottom to the most expression .
Video : I can recombinate the sequence of the sequence . "
So I don 't have to plate it before , but I can 't do it , but I can 't do it ,
And now , I can be the spend of the intersequence , the whole sequence , the Siftable to the Siftable . "
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is build new interaccounter-machine machine , more sound as they work our brain and body .
And today , I had time to show you one of the result of this perhaps , and some chance that we 're going to take out of the lab .
The concept I want to take you is that it 's that 's going to be a new generation of objects to interact with media media media , that will be able to our world in the way we want .
Thank you very much .
I don 't see the now to talk about you .
I 'm a writer .
I 'm my profession , my profession , but it 's more of this , of course .
It 's also the love love and the win my life .
And I don 't expect that can 't change .
But , he said , this particular is succeful in my life and in my own own own own , which has been to recently .
The particular thing is I recently written this book , this kind of book called " Mang , Pra , " which , Ama , Ama , which , I 'm going to be a great reason to use , for some reason to use , and it 's a great feelational , bestler , bestler .
And the result of it is that anywhere to me me as if they were able to me as if I had been constructed .
It 's true -- I 've been concerned .
They 're all from me , now all I 'm going to do it , " You don 't have a better better than I do not to do better ?
You don 't have a bit of continue to write all of life without to make a book that can 't make a book that can be able to somebody ? "
that can you know somebody ? "
It 's rassusustasure , you know .
But it could go worst , I remember what I remember me more than 20 years ago , when I start to say , I was a adolescent -- I wanted to be a writer .
I was in the same reaction of the bottom .
And people said , " I don 't have to be able to have it .
You don 't have a lot of the refight to killed to killing ?
You don 't have a painting to do this .
So , you know .
The answer -- the short answer to all these questions is , " You . "
I 'm a lot of all those things .
I 've always had a painting .
And I also have a lot of other things that people couldn 't inating .
As the alth and other things spent .
But , for how I was about the write what I thought and I 'd to say , "
It 's rational ?
It 's logical that you have to be a sent to be spent to be a job that you sent to do .
But what 's so particular in this particular in the resologists to make us us us to be able to the mental health of the way that other carry not do it ?
How my father , for example , he was a engineer , and I don 't remember a time in his 40 years of activity that he asked if I said , if I said , if I said , "
There was no -- that blowroror of John , how ?
It didn 't work , so it was it , it 's it ?
Onestly , the engineers , as a group , they don 't have certainly , in the seuble reputation of being alcolized .
We have enough to writers , we have enough this reputation , and not just scritters , but it 's a lot of all , we have this reputation to be enormous .
And it 's not to look at the trip of the dead of the magnifes of the magnifes that , only in the fact , just in the fact , they 're a young young and often to their hand .
And even the ones that don 't have to be a recially disappeared by their dones .
In the Mailer , before I 'm going to die , in the last interview said , " Our my book , " A little bit of a more of the work of the work of my work .
But we don 't do this , when we 're talking about these things , because we 've heard these things in a long way we have completely interiorized and acception is a few of the notion that creativity and the indeed , and the art , the end , the end , the end , to the end .
And the question I want to take all today is : you 're all of the talk about today is , you know , what ?
I 'm well this , because I 'll go to a centimate by a hundred centimage of me not well for this supposed to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be .
I think it 's odious .
And I think it 's dangerous , and I don 't see the perpetuated in the next century .
I think it 's better incorner our own own lives .
And I know , I know , in my case -- in my case -- it would be very dangerous , I 'm going to be able to the most of the force , sound to be in which I 'm in my career .
Of course -- I 'm looking at , I 'm quite young , I 've been young , I 've got about 40 years .
I still have about four decacades of work in me .
And it 's very likely that any thing I 'll be right now , then it will be right from the world as the work that I used to do my last book .
I 'm going to go back , because we 're all more or less friends here -- it 's likely that my biggest success is to my largest .
Oh , Gesber , that thought !
You know , this is the kind of thinking that door a person to start to the win the morning and I don 't want to do it .
I would continue to do this work that work .
So , the question is to the question , how ?
And so I look at me , after many reflessions , which the way to go to write the way to write the psychologist , OK ?
I wanted to find a distance of sure , I 'm going to write me , and my course , and my course of the anxial anxxial . And I was trying to go to the time to go to the time , and I was trying to find the time , trying to find some of the things to see if they 're going to to be the best ideas and more society and more and more society to make some of the best ideas and more society , and the most of the best ideas and more society and more society to make us to do it .
about how to help people believe that people to make the risks to the risks of creativity .
And that research has been to a phanic research and the Rome .
I 'm going to be able to sell me because I go back .
Nelantical Great and Great and the Rome -- people didn 't it -- they didn 't seem to believe that creativity to the men , OK ?
It was thought that creativity was this spirit , and they were to be a win and that I was a few surprise , and unknown to think about the reasons and unknown .
The green were called these divines , the spirits of creativity . "
You 're wonderful , wonderful , it was a demon that elaring a demon that elargen .
The Roands were the same idea , but they called the the species of the spirit .
The great thing , because the Rohands didn 't think a genuary genume was a smart of them .
And they think that a genuary genuary was this species of entity , which was a few of the study of a artist , a little bit like the elf of a artist , and that 's going to come out of the work of the work of the ards of the work of the aren and models to the result of that work .
Exxyonal -- here , that 's the distance of what I 'm going to do -- that costruction is the result of your work .
And everybody knew that was so that he was so that was it , right ?
So the artists were protect to things , like , as a lot of things , like , for example , no ?
If your work was excemotional , you couldn 't take it all the right right , they all knew the right , they all know , they were going to help .
If your work , your work , it wasn 't all your work , right ?
Everyone of you know , your genume to be a inhour .
And so people han conceive , creativity in Occident ,
Then the Rinascivement came , and he changes , and the nacking this idea ; we put the human being in the center of the universe , and the most of the universe and more to make space to creatures that they written to creatures from the divinity .
This was the major of humanity and people started thinking about the people started thinking about creativity , and they started thinking about the ilived .
And for the first time in history , you get to referirs to this or that artist as a genuary genuary , which is a kind of genuary .
And I have to tell you , I think it was a big mistainable .
I think you know , a simple person to be like a very simple person to be like a recil of how a repeessency and the surprise of all the misters , creativines , and eter-------phihihihidities , a very big file of human human beings .
It 's how to ask somebody to be a sun .
We 're completely going to be a completely ego and creating all these ingestiable expected on the performance .
And I think it was this pression to have been this pression to have been in 500 years .
And if this is , if this is , and I think it 's the question , and now ?
We can do it .
Maybe back to a comprororoad of human relationship between humans and mistery creative .
Or maybe it 's not .
Maybe we can 't have 500 years of thinking about a dead of 18 minutes .
And there 's probably people in the audience that will be able to be a scientific painting , the most of the inde-, but , you know , you know , the people are rate .
I 'm not going to be to do all this .
But the question I would I like to be -- why ?
Why don 't I think about this way ?
Because it 's more of every other thing that has ever heard to explain the exhist imprevehicity .
A process , as anybody ever ever ever I 've ever been doing something -- so , all here -- so , all here -- you don 't compories .
And , in fact , it can 't be a completely paranory .
I 've done this indeed with the extraordinary Ruth Stone , who was 90s , but he was a few years , but he was a poetse for all of life and said that she was in his infected in the rural , and he was working on the camps , and he was a pounds , when I was a soud .
He said he was like a fragorous tracks .
And he came out of her from her besage .
It 's going to be , because she was to be able to be a tremended to his feet .
He said to have one thing to do to that point and it was , " " I said , " I mean , " I mean , " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " I mean it was a major . "
And so he 's going to go to the house and he was a few exia , and it didn 't have another piece of carry and a little bit of a carry , and a little bit of a a little bit of a little bit of a page .
Sometimes I couldn 't be enough to be enough , so he was so much to be able to go to the house and he was going to to go to the house and she was going to to go to the house and she was going to go to the patholate through through the pathy , and she said , " another poet . "
Then there were those times -- this piece of the time -- I 'm going to never -- there were the moments in which was almost lost , OK ?
So , she was going to go to and she was trying to the head and he was trying to go through , and he was a matched in the time , and then said , and then he said , and then he said , and then he was like it with the other hand and the dought .
It was a poesia from the cold coda and he reput it in his body and he was going to be the page .
And in these cases , the poesia would be presented on the perfect , and I mean , but the last word .
So when I feel thinking -- it 's a feeling , it 's exactly the ugual process .
I don 't know my process -- I 'm not a cut .
I 'm a mud , and my way to work is , and I 'll see it 's ; every day and go to the horary , and I 'll go to the herself .
But even I 'm in my my my mother , I 've been a pay about what , I 've got a time .
And I think a lot of you the han fact .
You know , if the work and ideas , they were to be able to be a sourource , you can 't be the windows .
And what is this thing ?
And how can we go to it in a way to do it , but it 's a bit , but , rather , , that you take us ?
For me as I 'm about , the best example , I have the musicist Tom Waundary Tom Waun, which I interviewed a day .
We were talking about this , and you know , Tom , for the most of life was the incarry of the artist st , or trying to control , to control , to control , to control , to control , dominate these species of impulate , and to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to the indeed .
But then I 'm going to go , and a day , and a day , and a day , while she was wind a Los Angeles , changed everything for him .
He was going to go to a tract , and all of a tract act of the melodia , who 's a little frame , and the despite , and the despite , and the despite , and the desiding , and the desidider , and the dest , but it 's a surprise .
It 's not a piece of card , it doesn 't a major , it didn 't a registrator .
So I started to feel this species of old old old , and he 's going to grow in him , " I 'm going to be a sessionate by this sessionate by this song .
I 'm not a lot of it , I can 't do it . "
And instead of the panic , you 'll stop .
I 'm going to be the interor process and did something completely new .
I 'm just the sky and said , " Scell , I don 't see that I 'm going to do ? "
" Ti seems to write a song now ?
If I really want to be a more than you can take a more than I can take me .
At trivments , I 'm going to be able to the other today .
I 'm going to disturbing Leonard Cohen . "
And his process working working on .
I don 't work , the work was still .
But the process , and the fish that was a gave , and he was releave when he was a presand genuary , the genuary genuary , and the genuary , and I 'll be remanued to where it was going to be a thing to be a thing that she was going to be a whole thing .
but the west , I 'm a collaboration , wonderful bizarra collaboration between Tom and this thing that he was not Tom .
So I 'm how I was about the story to change a little bit about the way I was working on and I 've got a time .
This idea , I save me when I was writing " Mang , Pra , and I , " and I , " and I know , what we all all of the things that we all all work on something and we 're working on something and I start to think that a disastaster , which is going to be a disaster , which is never to be a labor .
I don 't just just the worst , right the worth .
And I started thinking about a project .
But then I remember Tom who talked about the air and there .
So I go to my face on the writing and I go to my work and I go to a angle , the vuuum of the room .
And I said , " Site , " Sents , what , I go to the know , if this book not to be a brilant , no interest , no , no interest .
Because as I see it I 'm going to do this all I , I don 't have more than this .
So if you want to be better , you have to be a better .
OK . But if I don 't do it , I know what I do , I don 't do anything .
I 'm going to write the same thing because it 's my work .
And I 'd like to be able to my own today I presented to do my talk to do my part of the " Because -- I 'm so , OK -- -- I saccount in the North people were roundances of a , and music , and music , the music , and the music , and music , to the horse .
And they were always magnifes , because the ballerins were great , and they were fantastic .
But every so , I was a lot , something happened , and one of these artists was actually going to be a confix .
And I know what I know , because I know what you know , you know , a point , a performance so .
It was as if the time , it was a massive , and the ballerwalk through a species of a little bit , like the 1,000 night .
And to the improve not to be a human human .
But it 's accese in and the weight in the fuef of the divinity .
And when this next next to the day , I know , people knew what she was , he called her name .
They were to the hands and they started to dotate , " Allah , Allah , Allah , God , God , God , God , God , "
So , what 's God , you know .
Curious note -- when the Morororous , I was the sod of Spaiaim , and the pronto their own and the wildness of " Allah , Allah , " Ole , " Ole , " Ole , " The Ole , " I know , " I can still feel in the correct .
In Spain , when a artist has done something impossible and magic , " Allah , the Allah , Allah , I was a land-, I was a laby -- a last one , a last thing of God .
And it 's great because we need .
But , the problem is going to go to the day , the same , when you go down and discover that are the 11 of the morning of Martedanger , and the last last last last few of God there is no more .
It 's just a mortal with a gran hocks to , and maybe not to be more to the lower that allost .
And maybe no one will the name of God , as a God still , how do it to do with the rest of his life ?
It 's hard .
This is one of the most lifations to do in a life .
But maybe it doesn 't have to be so antively if they can 't believe , if you can 't believe , anzees , which the most extraordinary of your being from you .
But you 're just going to be a good inimaginable to be able to be able to be able to the kind of of your life that you have to go to someone else else when you finished .
And , you know , if we think about this way .
And so I started thinking about , and it 's so sure as I thought I 'm going to be a different months in the book that I 'll be able to do the dangerous , I 'm going to be able to do .
And I think I have to continue to me when I feel it 's a feeling from this is , not to have a feeling .
I don 't have to be . I 'm just your work .
Continua presenting , for your part , any of your part , any can be .
If your work is balling , balls .
If the divine , I asking up to the end , I 've got to leave a few kinds of wonderful , for a moment through the tuss , then " " " Ole ! "
I 've got the same your dance .
And " Ole ! " I 'll be the same .
I think I think I think , I 've got to teach it .
" Ole ! " I think , even for you have love human love , I 'm just going to be able to do you to do you .
Thank you .
Thank you .
June Cohen : Ole !
As I 've already talked about some of these projects on the human genome , about what can meaning and discover of the genes .
Now we 're starting a new perspective : we started digital , and now now now now , we 're going to start from that code the biology of biology , design and wintetizing life .
We always tried to take a big questions .
" What is life ? "
We tried different appreciate apate , we reduced to the terms .
We 're digital to be a few years .
When we sequenced the human genome was going to be about the world from the analogical world of the world .
Now , let 's ask , we can we regenerate life , or create new new life from this universe ?
This is the map of a little organism , Mycoplasma genitalium , which is the species of the genome of those who can autorem .
And we tried to reduce the genome for crearen for a more little bit .
We 're able to eliminate a cently of the genes of about 500 genes of the genes of about 500 .
But when we go to a metabolic map , is a simple respect to our .
I think , it 's simple .
But when we look at all the genes that we can eliminate , one to the time , it 's very imprororobable that we can bring a cells .
So we decided that the only one to progreatest to say , this chmosound to be able to be able to be able to the components to the components to the components of these questions .
And so we began to the " of the " we can you a chromosoma ? "
Can you can 't you take these big molecules that we never have to make these big molecules that we never have to create before now ?
And , in case , we can make a cheap ?
A cococold is just a piece of material material ,
The speak of the speak we are able to digital life is growing to go to the exponential .
We have to write the genetic code , instead , instead , instead , but it 's best , it 's better .
And our most recent result to a curve .
We were in the most of 15 years ago .
The process has reasked a lot of spacters , start with a bioetic revision before we start with a first experiments .
But we found that that intetize the DNA is very hard .
There are a decade of thousands of cars in the world that they 're a little segments of DNA , and it 's a process : the most segment is a long time , the most sugment is , more mile , there are .
So we had to develop a new metod to asking these framvement and correcrecreceive .
And this was our first tentertainment , in the digital of the digital of the genome of the PGoogle 174 .
It 's a little viruses that kills .
We designed the framments , effective the correction of the stainable , and I got a molecule of DNA about 5,000 land-DNA of about 5,000 land-cover .
The interesting thing is when we took this piece of material material , and we 've got to be in the bacteria , bacteria , bacteria , and the bacteria , and property the particles .
The particles are then we 're then going to go back from cells , they 're going to go back and they 're going to go back and they 're going to to the Everything .
I talked about a recently with a oil of the oil industry , the oil oil , which they 're trying to do this model .
They 're going to request .
We think this is a situation where the software can really build his same .
But we wanted to do things in the larger .
We had to build the whole bacteria .
I 'm more 50s , the genetic code .
So we thought we 've been building a sorts of the size of the viruses , so we can change the cast of a cells .
The desigation is crucial design is crucial , and if we start with information in a computer , these are very accurate .
When we sequenced this genome for the first time in 1995 , the time in 1995 , the bottom of a mile .
We found , 30 mistainable . If we had to use that original , 30 mistainable to be able to do it .
A part of the process is designing to smomoved 50 lapart that you 're a lot of the other segments of 50 land-sments to build a little more than 50 lapart that working together .
We 're a whole thing to the unbelieved here .
So you 're going to be able to be a great .
Thanks , we have a genetic code on four land-s-four land-code , Gs , and T.
To those land-paid together , they were about 20 friend , and there 's a specific adadadadd , and it 's a specific lessful of the lower .
So we can use the genetic code to write words , fressesses .
What we did it to the beginning is a authograped to do it .
Some of the fact , they had a lot of the fact that didn 't have a few exia .
We designed these segments for a few of them just to me .
There are essentientime that they 're going to go to and put them .
And we started to be able to be able to be able to be a sending with segments , unended to the way to the sending to the unending to 72 to the unununless to 72 the meet .
So , we 've produced these segments in a sorts of these saving sourney we 're tenting to create a processing with a minute of the construction .
We 're trying to automatize the process .
So , this seems to be the tabellon of a boket .
When we go to these segments , more than 100 mile , more than 100 mile , not grow up in the Everything .
It 's going to be the limited of modern biology .
So we 've been looking at other mecdodododododownnice .
We were another meckyism called the recombination , which in biology , which in biology to reflying the DNA in order to reflying the DNA in the inforth .
So here 's a example .
This organism , called Deinococing , can assupply , can assors three million rad of radiation .
You can see in the long long as his chmosound ,
In 12 -- 24 hours is reported to be the right right .
They 're able thousands of organisms that are able to do it .
These organisms can sitting .
They can live in the vuuuum .
I 'm absolutely obviously that life in space , and you know , places to find new sorts of water .
I mean the NASA has showed that this is .
This is a molecule that we built with these processing , just using these processed , just using the lifestors of the ssent , to put it .
The lifeter homatically .
This picture was not not been doing with a microscope with a electronic microscope , but with a microscope .
It 's a molecule , so big that we can see the microscope .
These are pictures that I 'm a long time about six seconds .
This is the advertising that we did .
I 'm more 580,000 land-code .
It 's the most largest of a defined structure of a defined structure .
It has a lot of a molecular fish .
If you 're going to stamstep with a 10 without spaces , there would be 142 pay this code , it 's just to the genetic code .
Now , how do we do it work ?
Of course , a virus is a game from kids .
It 's a little more complicated when they use of bacteria .
And it 's more simple when it 's more cells , the eucariote as our : you can just be the nuclear or and I inseries , which is basically the process of the well-in-in-in-inforth process .
In the bacteria is the bacterm is it in the cells , but we recently dested that we 're able to do a very complex cells to do a very complex cells to a slosound of a cell of a cell .
We 've got a cold , a little bit of a microbial species .
The two are different as men from the tops .
We add some gene in more and more to decide what they can do to do this this chmosoma .
The then sciolden with the olden of all the protech .
And when we put in the cells is been study -- and appreciate , you appreciate our gravails -- the new chromosopher -- the new cold .
And we start thinking about it , but we 're not going to go to the more , but we tried to the most in there .
This is one of the most most of evolution .
We found that many species have to add a second or a second or a third chmosound or a second , and a few of new new tracts to the species .
So who think about evolution as a gene , and at the time that you 've got to be a granded part of the biology .
They 're going to be a construction called me " The restripection that I 'll be able DNA .
The comosoma that was in the cells .
The phula-co--cocococold we have to put it .
It 's espressed , and he recognized the other things like material as a material , has been romoved , and we 've got to be all the cells .
It 's become blue because of the genes we 've been able .
And in a short of time , all the characteristic of a species are and-, and it 's transformed , and it 's a new species , the moved of the cells .
All the protech are changed , the membrane , and when we go to the genetic code , when we read the genetic code that we have to put you .
Now , this could look at the alchmy genetic , but altering the software DNA we can change things in a lot of things .
Now , I 've been explain that here is not about genesis -- but about progress of progress , and a half million years and a half of evolution , and I said that maybe we 're going to create a new species of the Cambrian that will be a new species of the development of this process .
Why do I do it ?
I think it 's enough obvious when we think it 's our necessity .
We 're going to go to six billion and a half billion people in the next 40 years in the next 40 years .
Right to take a example : I was nated in 1946 .
Now there are three people on the planet for each naaathesist in 1946 , there will be four .
We 're going to go to find food , water , and the wind , and the wine , and the wine for six billion people .
It will be more than to be able to be able to noine billion .
We 're going to be more than about five billion coal , more than 30 billion baries .
So it means million baries to the day .
When we 're trying to find processes , or any kind of process to reach them , it will be a huge challenge .
We have to have more to the CO2 from the CO2 from these materials that I 've got to the atmosphere .
And in day , thank to discovered in all the world , we have a database with about 20 million genes , and I love to think that they are the components for the future .
The electronic industry just a dozen industry , and think about how many different things are going to be out .
The limitites are data from the biological , and the fact , and the imagination .
Now we have the techninights , therefore , thize these metods of intetization , in a combinatory .
We 're able to build a big robot that can produce a million chromosopher .
Those about this 20 million genes , these 20 million genes or to provide , and they can make a very much , and the waccess , and the most biology , we can change , and create more biology , and create more biology , and create more biology , and create more biology , and create create more biology ,
And it 's just a selection ,
We can go to the chance to survive , production , or deal , production , production of the vaccetc .
This is a an anthy of some software software program that we 're working for a computer computer .
Well , we don 't know how to be .
We know exactly the code is their genetic .
Now we 're going to take the carbs of the energy of the quarter .
You 've seen you that I 've been a experiment of the grandle is a experiment .
We have a carbon of the second generation , and third generation that they 're going to be a cold , or a lot of more than the most of the most of the most of the most of the butany .
But the only way the biology that biology can have a great impact without aumenting the cost of food food and limitary food , and the limitary of food , which we 're working for design cells that we 're working on the cells that we 're working for design cells that they can reach this to design cells , and we think , and we think , and we think about the first time .
The solar solar solar light with the CO2 is a metodo-- but in our discovered in all the world , we found different .
This is a organism we 've described in 1996 .
It 's in the ocean , at the ocean , for about 2500 feet of proffoundity to the water .
And they think about the CO2 using a molecular molecular as the source of energy .
We 're trying to figure out if we can indog CO2 , which can be transformed to be transformed to the CO2 in the CO2 in the CO2 in the carbon this process .
So we short , we can be able to be able to be able to aumenting what the question of " which is the life , " We have the worth of the bottom to the oil oil oil to the oil to the oil oil food food .
Exxyle . If you can 't it to do it .
It would be a main of energy .
And we 're working for the same metods to to make the same metods to make vaccines .
You 've seen this year with the influence , we always go back to a dollar in least when it 's a dollar in the right .
I think what you can be to build a combinable to be able to be able to be able to be able to build .
So , here is how the future could start , now , the trees , the trees , acceping the evolution , which is the evolution with bacteria , and I inend the cells .
We are so much about the best people .
Our discover is to do to live enough to live enough to live enough to do . Thank you . Thank you . Thank you .
So , but I 'll do you to see , the most of the most of technology , some of the new technology that we 've got to the Microsoft , a little bit of the technology that is almost a year ago . This is a year ago . This is exactly .
It 's a lot of the environment that you can interact with a level of data that remote with a lot of data .
So here we 're a very very very very very very , very much of digital with a kind of zoom om we 're going to be a pay , and a velootherwim , we want to be the images like we want .
And it doesn 't matter how big the amount of information that we see , how big these are these things like these .
Most is common on photographs , but this example is a scaningly , but this example is a scaningly , and recenter in the Congress , and remajjjource .
It doesn 't have a difference because the only thing that limited the predictions of a system like this is the number of pixel on your screen in any time . It 's a very flessible .
This is a book , for example of data not images .
This is Casa desolated Dolated . Overy colonna represented a capitital .
For you to show you that it 's just about images , and not images , we can do a thing , to see that it 's a real real representation of the text , not a picture .
It would be a little bit in the artificial , to read a electronic book .
It 's not to be a reach .
This is a more example of the North . It 's a number of the NNot .
Every big is the beginning of a seition .
And it 's going to be a very , and the beautiful experience of read the end of a painting , or a a quooties , which is for nature of a a half a molecule .
We also did something with the angle of the NNNot .
We created a advertional walk , we 've got a very more than that you use in a normal adversus -- and we 've got to be able to the extraordinary .
If you want to see the characteristic cars , you can see here .
Or other models , or even the specific models .
And this really demonstring some of these ideas to eliminate the limitites of the screen .
We 're going to do that , you put a little bit , and other hour , and to other porate , not to be more to be necessarily to be to be to be to be more to be to be to .
In fact , the map is one of the applications .
And on this is not to lose time , if we don 't say that we have the contribute to this field .
These are all the strade in the United States , is a very much of NASA .
So now we go to something else .
This now is effectively from the web ; you can go to see .
It 's a project called Photosynth , which combine two different technologies .
A lot of the Sewagon and the other is a research to the computer very interesting computer in the Noah Snavely , a student of the University of Washington , with the Seitz of USeitz of Reseseski Microsoft Reseski 's colub . It 's collaboration .
And it 's from the web , I widon Seadagon .
You can see when we do this like this kind of screpay , where we can go from a image to the other experience of experience .
But the collocation of images here here has a effective .
The algorites of visualization of computers have registrated these images , in the way that I think the way to the places that I think the walk to the Montagage Rococcurred to the Montagan is -- all the way you 're all the things to be . So , here , here 's a few show of a slightly t-show show , and these things are all the things .
I don 't know if I don 't know , I 'm going to show you some other environment .
And there are some more space .
I want to go to a bit a data of Noah-- and this is a precedent of Noahhern , that we did work for the first time we did work for the first time , the first time , the first time , the first time , the first time , the first time , the technology , the chiess is not necessarily to be looking at the webor . And it 's not to look at the web this technology .
We had to be worry about the law and forth .
This is a rebuilding of Notle of Notle Damamams , and Flickr . Badigit 's a Notle in Flickr and you get to be a kind of a magicipate , and you go to the other of these coni . Ognant converage is to the express that is the perhaps to this is the expressed .
So I 'm all images and I 've all been all connected to the space in this way .
And it 's possible to be navigate in this way .
You know , I never thought I 'd never ever to work for Microsoft .
It 's very gratificing to get this kind of accoastern here .
I think you can see that it 's a lot of different type of different typpphip : from those professionals , a number of meanances , a number of meaning , and this environment .
And if you can , I prove to look at those more strange .
Many are blowing from the way .
So , it 's a series of photographs -- it 's a lot of photographs -- it 's a lot of photographs --
This is a poster of Nots Damamong registrated .
We can go from the physical view of this environment .
The point is that we can do with the social things with the environment . This is now now now , by the data from the interest to the land , from the view of the land , from the view of the world , from the visual , and connection to all those data .
All those pictures are connected together , the most of the parts .
You have a model of the land .
Those about this as a prolungment of work of Stephen Lawler on Earth Earth Earth .
It 's something that grow in complexity , hand , and the people are going to use , and the people who are going to use .
And they 're a picture of them with a metadadadadated with a lot of people .
If somebody is the idea of contrast , they 're all the idea of these people say , my name , my picture of Notle , my picture of Notle 's herself , and I can use how to use how to use how to the point of all the universe , you can use how to the universe , using the universe , and I can use the result of the experience of the kind of of sorting and a kind of of sorts of the kind of of a a saving .
On , a consequence of all this is the virtual models of all the most interesting of the Earth , the most interesting part of the Earth , the memory , and from the satells and by the memory of the ground , but from the memory .
Milllletter .
Chris Anderson : I understand it 's good ? What your software us to do is that your software to do is that a certain point , in the next years , all the photography , all the photography of the world , you can be basically connected to do this ?
BAA : Yeah . What 's doing it is doing it .
It 's a lot of the hyperlink , if you want to be ,
And it 's doing it in the bottom of images .
The thing is to be very interesting if you think about the chemiity of information to the several information that many of these images .
As a research research on the web , you have a frase , a frase and the web , the web has a lot of information about images .
Now , what do you do you connecting all the pictures ?
So the amount of interconnection and the amount of the several interconnection that you will be a classical classical . It 's a classical classical classical .
CA : Blaise , it 's really incredible .
BAA : I 'll thank you very much .
One of the most of the major when you go to and one of the research of the research is the perspective , which we can 't live in who who the past the past , between who the past the past , between who who versususususus , the past in the plants , and the wind of the plant , is the walk .
Basti think the sciamamans , Jagues are still the Via Lattea , or the mittea , or that the wild is still a lot of meaningful , or that in Himalaya , the most of Dapbut , the most of Dma , to remember the most of Dma , but to remember the world , and the idea that 's just a sense of the world , but it 's just a sense of the world , but it 's just a model of the world ,
The consequence of a particular choice of choice that our own rpe has done , well or good , many generations .
And , of course , we all share the tracts .
We all all of it . We 're all going to do .
We 're all about the way to start .
We have to have to do the inesorability of death , so we don 't surprise if we 're going to be like , and we 're going to do .
We all have a art .
What we 're going to be the particular of the song , the song of every culture .
It 's not not the TED TED TED TED , or the Borneo , or the Wodoor of the Vodoor of the Saunt , or the Kenya to Kenya to Kenya a to Borcide , Curge , a cample , or a camera of the Ande , or a Scuric .
He was my company , my company in the desert of the desert , or a month ago , or a a well-to-to-to-to-to-mother , the demother of the world .
All these populations are teaching us that there are other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , other ways of the world .
And if you reflective , is a concept that can give you a hope .
And then , the mirian of the world creating a world creating a ragnobody of life spiritual , and it 's important to the planet and it 's important to the planet and it 's important to the planet as the biophoootic .
And you can think about this ragnoon , as a a nine of the etnosphere , and you can defining the exhic of all the conceptively , and the whole conceptions , ideas , inspired , ideas , inspired , intuitive to be from the human human human human consciousness of the human human consciousness .
The sphere is the fantastic sphere is the fantastic of humanity .
It 's the symbx of what we are and what we can be in how we can be in how many species .
And as the biosfit was a gravly consumed , the biophoothersphere and a much more quickly .
In fact , it would be a biologist , it would be the 50 percent of all the species is on the ority of the estimimation , because it 's a lot of the most apockest -- in the most apocities -- in the biological of the biological issues -- that 's not neighborhohood to the human human human human human beings -- that 's -- that 's -- that it 's about the diversity .
The ununfortunately said , of course , the perdent language .
When you 're 6,000 language and on this planet .
A language is not just by a vocabolary or from a series of rules .
A language is a human spirit .
It 's the middle with which the animor of every culture , it 's going to be in the world .
Every language is a language of the mind , a backkinince , a chance of the ability of the spiritual .
And of those 6,000 language , and as we are the sedent in Monterey , at least the half the hororchie of the children .
It 's not more teaching kids , the kids , the way , you know , not the way , which is not going to be .
What is there 's more tried to be to be a lighter of the last talk , of the last talk , of the last talk , of the last one of the children ?
This is a few weeks , it was a few of the world every two weeks : every two weeks , and a few weeks , and a door and the domb of a language of a language of a language of a language language .
And I know somebody to say , " It 's not better so ?
We don 't be a better place if we 're all the same language ? " " Well , then we all talk about all the language ? "
We 're going to go to kogi .
You can 't be able to be able to talk about the language .
I 'd like to do you to do a journey through the etnospsphere --
a little journey in the etnospsphere to give you a sourney of what we 're perdying .
Many of us dimenticate that when I say , " different ways of us , " inting very different ways of exists .
We make example , this bimbo Barasan , in Amazonia , the popular of the popular or anacond , which creating the sacond of the latest of the latest in the panef of the sackers .
It 's a popular popular that it 's not able to distinguing the color of the blue , because the time , the time , the time , from the forest .
They have a strange language and a rle of the language , " " " " " " " I say , " I say , " demonstring a lot of language .
Everything has been in the past the past the past the past the launch , is that in these families and the walk , and the most of the world , and the nobody is that they 're not a language .
They can listen to listening to and then start to talk .
We make a triber of the triber with the most interesting of the Ecuador of Ecuador , a popular popular , a popular popular that has had the first concerned in 1958 .
In 1957 five missionary missionary .
They did the lowing the photographs that they were going to go to the end that they were going to be friend , the popular of the forest , or the forest , which was never seen anything about the size .
They were working on the Earth , they were going to be a research or a shape or a shape , and they didn 't find anything , they 'd to be sitting , and they killed to the end , and they killed the five five five five five five five missionary .
But Waorans don 't killed to the strong souble .
They killed to them .
54 percent of the mortality was used to their same .
We went to the oted generations and we found two cases of death , of course , and when we 've been to know , they love to know , they were invectly to me , and then they 've killed , and then they killed , and then they killed it , and then they killed to know a knowledge .
The crugs were able to recognize the animal , from 40 steps and recognize the species .
In the first years , it was ased a companies , I was a very interesting companies when my professor of Harvard , if I wanted to go to Haiti to Haiti and Tonton the bottom and Tonton the Tonton Macocool , and Tonton the Tonton Macocool to do .
For a sense of a mianger , I would have to make the culture Vodoun and the Vodoor is not magic .
It 's quite a complex of the world .
A interesting .
If I ask you to me the great religions of the world , what you do you ?
Cristianesimum , Islam , Buddism , Ebraism , etc .
A continent is always let me go out , thinking that Africa Africa 's not a feeling religious . And the Vodoor is , and the Vodoor is not another one of these concepties in the tragic conceptively , in the tragic organized to the sslavism .
What 's interesting the voodoor is the inting of life and death .
So the spirites to the spirites .
The spirites can be invocked by Grande Acqua , the people to the end of the dance and they 're going to be able to the time to the time to the end of the time to the end of the way to the dio .

Mayaachieved to talk about the ayachief , the most powerful psycoactive of the reperhaps ,
What makes it a walk the ayasilllaby is not the potential to do , but his elaboration . It 's the most of the most elements . It 's the whole thing .
So , this lian lawnose that contise to a series of the cooline , and a lot of , and harm , read .

Now , [ [ applaushers the problem is that even the ones of us who have to heart popular the popular of us , but in a few way to the margines of the history of our world , and they 're going to be a real world , and they 're going to be a real world .

All the cultures through the seuuble , and it was in a dance for new chance of life .
And the problem is not the technology .
The Indians don 't stay to be Sioux when they put it out of the American people , and they 're just like American people , they don 't walk from American , when they put it part of the Americans .
It 's not the change or technology that they 're doing the integrity of the etnosphere . It 's the power . It 's the power .
The domination of the domination .
And if you look at a look at the world , you 'll find that these are not cultures .
I think they 're creatures and dynamics of the existence of the forces of the way to adaping their ability to adaping .
I know , it 's ssleed to the slead of the thought --

The modern world world 's a 300 years .
That 's a quallida story I don 't suggests that we have the risk to all the challenge that we have to do in milleness .
When to these miriap of culture , the world is asked what we want to say to be humans , for 10,000 people .
And it 's in these pounds that we all have the chance of being what we are : a species of the world , that has to be a way that all the popular of the popular . And there are great moments of good . And there are great moments of good .

And , to finish , I think it 's quite obvious , at least at least at those song of the planet , to make it not a mote .
For somebody 's house .
They 're going to be a severtions of human imagination that they 're going to be the time . And for all of these kids , like the dreams , like the dreams , the sounds of our children , become part of hope .

where the saggeity of all the popular can contribute to our own own own own as the eat .
Thank you .
I 'm going to talk about some things I writing in this book that I hope or the other that you 've heard and provertising some connections , in the case , in case , in case , it 's not to the case .
I would start with what I call the " dogma " " " "
The dogma dogma ?
The dogma recial of all the society , the West est est the dogma , but we want to massive the west of our own own own own own own own , " The way to do it is the way to the freedom . "
The reason is , from a side , in fact that the freedom is in the fact , it 's a value , is predictile , essential to humans .
And the other is in fact that if we 're librought , each of us can do it for all that the massive , no one that the massive , no one that decided to our own .
The way to massive is the freedom is massive to the choice .
More choice people , they 're librought , and most of their freedom , the most of the freedom , the most of their own own .
This , I think , is so much much much in society that nobody has no one to put it in the society that nobody could put it in the weight .
And it 's also profly in our lives .
I 'll show you some examples of what progress has to be .
This is my supermarket . It 's not a big .
I losing a simple note on the condition of the mind .
In my supermarket is 175 conditions , not concertainly the 10 variety of olids , and 12 acetes , and 12 acetes that you can buy a huge number of the extraordinary number of of the constance of your own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own .
So here 's a supermarket .
Then you go to the neighborhood , to buy a stereo : you sitting a , the CD , the bottom , the bottom .
And in this single negogotten , there 's a big number of components .
We can do six million different combinations of different combinations using the components that there are in a neighborhood .
You have to love that there is a lot of choice .
Atrusual world of communications .
And once , when I was a child , you could all have to get all the telephone phone .
It was a phone phone , not the phone , not to buy it .
A consequence of what the other , the phone was that the telephone didn 't ropaid .
These days are gone .
We have a variety of the telephones , specially between the telephones , specially between the phone .
So here 's the phularly the future .
My favorite is what in a half , the MP3 , tapeli , and forth , and forforth to the crash .
If you don 't have seen in the neighborhood , you 're brought to the walk .
And what the end is that people are in the negogogods and do this question . And what 's the answer is " No . "
It 's not possible to buy a phone that not to do it .
So , in other other things that are much more important of the people who are the most important things that are the same same .
Avery stage blood . It doesn 't happen in the United States that you go from the doctor and the doctor , what you have to do .
I go to the doctor , and the doctor , and the doctor , " OK , we could do A , " A , " A , " A man , " A has these sell . "
Tu the people , " Did , what I should I do ? "
And the doctor says , " A has these wils and these sell , and the hurs and these walk . "
" What do you want to do ? "
And you rebits : " Did you , if she was me , what would you do ? "
And the doctor : " But I 'm not she . "
The result of the result of the malmalaria , " The malmalmalmalmalmalmalaria .
But it 's actually not that a sitting the fish and responsibility to make a decisions of the decisions to make something , others , the doctor , to someone else -- and so much , it 's malmalmalzed is , and so it 's malmalally malaria -- and so it 's not to take the patient .
There 's a huge marketing of products , you can 't get to people like me and you , you know , if you think no sense , it 's given you , you know , you can 't buy it .
But if we don 't buy them , why they have to be ?
The answer is that they want to be in the morning , we call the doctor to ask us us us .
So , what we have to be a fundamental of how we 've never have a question of choice , how we see this vious vious vious children . " We don 't want to to be a good time . "
And we can reinvented us a lot of times ,
The one of the morning , at the risk , you decide that kind of person want to be .
I was a family , and the most of the time , a time the major a time , they were almost to be a lot of the most price , it was that he was the most price , and he started to the most price .
The only versus it was with who , not when you know , and it 's not when you know what do after .
Of course , all is really to play .
I 'm a very smart in students , and they 're the 20 percent of the work for a time .
And it 's not because they 're not just a gentertainly , because they 're not not not because they 're not just diligent .
but why I 'm impensit , I mean , I would you say , " I would you say , " I would you say , " I would you do it ? "
" I would I be to be more later ? I wanted to think before I think before I was ? "
I 'm all the logatives you .
And they 're trying to answer these questions , even if this is not to do this questions , even if this is not to get a bel , and not to get a bel .
And they have to do it . I 'm important to do .
Now , the work : we 're lucky , like Carl soolden , because technology had to work every day , every day , every day , every day , the time , the Hotel Randolph .
Tra , there 's a anger , and I didn 't tell no one who , where the WiFi Fi works .
I don 't say , because I want to use me .
What does it mean , this incredible ble ble ble ble ble choice we have to continue , we continue to do , if we have to work or not .
We can go to our son play , with the phones , with the phones , the Blackberry in a cell , and the nocction , the teach .
And even if I 'm all spent , every minute that we see our son , we 're also going to ask , " Do I said , " I said , " I said , " I said , " I said , " I said , " I said , " I said , " I said , " I said , " I said , " Do you have all the spent , " I said , " D
" I said , " I said , " I wanted to the end ? "
And even when the answer is " " " " " " " " " " " It 's a very different thing to the end of your son , it would be in other conditions .
So , from any look at the little , and the great materials , objects , and the whole thing of life , life is a question of choice .
So , the world was , there were some chance , there were some chance , but it wasn 't a question of choice .
The world of the world today : The world 's the dilemma is , " It 's a good thing , or negative ? "
The answer is Saaahead .
The positive positive you know , we know , I 'm going to talk about the negatives .
All this choice compories are two actually two actually actually actually , two people in the people .
The first , paradoadopted .
With many options , which is a very hard to do it .
I 'm going to do a meaningly : a condoor depend about the plants .
A connected to the data of the Vances of the Vances of the Vanthession of the size of the clients of the clients in 2,000 companies .
What she found is that for every 10 solutions that are offered that they 're offered in more , percentual , the percentual of adesion .
With 50 sourth , there is the 10 percent of adesions , there 's 10 percent . Why ?
Because with 50 sourth , which is maleding , is maledsus , and the choice is remanuly hard to the inforce .
And to the morning , and again , I 'd saves , and of course , and of course , they 're never going to be .
Capite that doesn 't only only that these work from old old food to the people who will not be money , to say , " even to say that the decision is so osticking the decision of the dator of the work .
I don 't talk about it , they 're perdying to five dollars for a year from the dator of work , that would be a disappeared to be .
So the paraliis a consequence of to have a foccurred of it .
And I think that 's the world .
" And to finish , for the eternity : " " "
You 're going to take the decision , if it 's the eternity , if it 's the eternity , right ?
You don 't want to go to the wrong wrong , and you know the wrong direction .
So this is the first effect . The second is that if we can eventually get to eventually , we 're less sodaught , we 're less sodaught to be with less options .
And this for different reasons .
A lot of these is that with many of these are with many of the people who who writing , if you 're going to be a perfect , is easy to be a very different choice that it would be better . And what it 's going to be better . And what it 's going to be better . And what it 's going to be better . And what the recognized the re-to--to-in-re-to-pite , and the pay , and the decision to the decision to be a very much of these .
And when it was a good decision .
More choice , there 's more is easy to have any any of any double , or you know , it 's unsopher of the option .
And it 's about , there is what economists call .
Dan Gilbert has a very well , very well , how the value that we go to things to things with what we converted .
So , when there are many options , when there are many options , it 's easy to be a accounteristics of the alterative of the alterative of the option that is choice .
So , a example . I 've been a example .
But it 's probably thinking .
There 's this pay with the Hamptons .
A place of a pushed .
It 's sitting in the lendida . It 's all about them . It 's all about them .
I don 't do anything . But that he think he 's " Well , the fact , it 's Agotten . "
" Everybody my neighborhood is . "
" I could go to a lot of your house . "
And two weeks and put a few weeks in the idea that it 's perdying -- every day -- every day -- the chance of the park where you want .
The constantly opportunity to the soddisfy the soddisfly , when the choice was , when the choice was a phone .
And more are the options that we have to look at the most of the accounteristics that we 're going to be opportunity .
So , another example .
This vivious vious things .
It 's about live in the time , and maybe of live in the time , and maybe of us .
But the most important point is that you 're not to do , you know what you 're doing other .
The things we don 't do it .
Terther point : spiral to grow .
I tried to my pin the bbs a new couple of jeans .
I 'm almost always jeans .
So , once the jeans were of a one , they buy and windows , they were discovery , and they were discovery , after I was discovered a lot of times , they started a lot of times , they started to go to it .
So , I went to buy a new when the old were going to go , and I said , " I said , " I need a couple of jeans , this is my tuny . "
The common said , " Look , you know , the cool , and the short , and it ? "
And I want to want to take with the botton ? " Stonebotton ? "
" Lothing wants ? "
" I mean , I mean , or the blue ble ? BBBBle , " -- " Continua to the way .
I was sorted , and after a little bit of it , and after a little bit , " I want to say , " I want to be a idea of what I 'm going to be , so for a time .
It was the massive . I had to get the better .
But I feel worst .
Why ? I writing a book to understand it .
The reason I was worst , or is that with all the choice of my expected expected were altime , the jeans had to be perfect .
I was beginning to be a minist . I didn 't expect any excemotional , when I was a kind of a , but when I found 100 different , at least a kind of like to be perfect .
What I had to do it was good , but not perfect .
After I was a paraged what I was trying to do with what I was trying to do with what I was in converversus .
The add of options in life , people don 't do that aumenting these are expect to expect the options of the options .
And this is going to be a soddisfly , when the result of the good .
In the world of marketing , if it 's a lot of it .
Because if they know , they didn 't know what I 'm talking about what I 'm talking about .
The verity is the best to this .
" It was better when she was worst or " The reason that was better when she was worst or the reason was worst or it was worst to be able to the surprise of the surprise .
On the world we live -- in the world we live -- the indualized , indualized , the most of the perspective -- the massive things that we can hope is that the things to the altel of expect .
You don 't have to be surprise because your expected expected , my expected expected , I 'm ingantical .
The secret of happiness -- what you 're here -- it 's , " Bought , " Well , " Yes , " You know . "
I mean -- a little moment I 'm repeat -- I 'm repeak , and my wife is really study .
I couldn 't do better , I couldn 't do it .
But it 's not always is a good thing .
So , a consequence of buy , a couple of jeans discovered when there is just that you 're not just like , when you 're not a lot of jeans , and ask you " Why ? "
" Chi is responsible ? "
The world is the responsible . What can you do it ?
When you have a hundreds of types of a jeans , and you know , you ask you , and you ask you who 's the responsible , is the responsible you .
You were to do better .
Con hundreds of variety of variety of variety of variety of variety of various variety .
So when people take a decisions , even if the result of it is , they 're sitting , they 're going to be a double and they 're going to be .
In the last years , the last years , is exhihilose in the world indualized .
I think a fattore meaning -- not the only one , but that 's important -- this ond , but that people have experiences to be able to be too much at the people because the walk .
And when they have to explain this situation that they think the colps is .
So the result of the end is that we 're better better , obviously better , but we 're going to be worst .
Let me remember you remember .
This is the dogma , what we all take for good and it 's completely fast . It 's not true .
There 's no wouldn 't be a little bit of choice is a better than I don 't have to be better than a little bit of it . But it 's not to a little bit better than a little bit .
There 's a critical value , I don 't know what it 's .
But I 'm quite sure we 've been able to a piece of the best level that we have to be able to our life .
Now , from the point of the political view -- I 've almost almost a political view , the noccy is the following .
What you lows all this choice in the industry is the role .
There are many places in the world , and you know , you know , you know , which is not that they have a lot of them .
The problem is that they 're too too much .
So the thing I 'm talking about is a maling maling is a malime of modern modern , remarkable society .
And what does is to depress and array this : Steve Levitt , Levitt you 've talked about how those are inutions . It 's a spend of money . It 's a spend of money . It 's a reutions . It 's a reutions . It 's a reutions . It 's a reutions . It 's a reutions .
I mean these choice , complicated and you have to be inutions .
I 'm advuuum .
They 're going to be worse .
If a little bit of what in our society is reversed to the fact , it was reversed in those where people are too , it would not just be just to be able to be able to be able to our best .
This is what the economists called a midary .
A reflection of the redent redent , I don 't just just to the poverty -- because of this choice in except that you have to be able .
For , " Freny , you can be everything that you want to do . "
You know , people , think , " But what 's it 's crete , " But what it 's going to do ? "
" It 's obvious that you can 't get anything in a bocy of the glass . "
" A imagation of the world -- " I mean , a limited vision of the world -- "
and ancher I interpreted this , I 've got the whole thing .
But then , I think , instead , instead , I 've got me that it 's a long long .
Because the fact of fact , it 's actually , if you get the bocy , so that , " all the way , you know , " everything possible to be good to be able to the freedom .
If you look at the bottom , you know , it 's just a sodddisfation .
