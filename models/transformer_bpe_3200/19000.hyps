I showed these these these slides to demonstrate that the sound calots , which for almost three million years had the size of the 48 dimensions of the 48 continental dimensions , is remarkable .
However , this subvaluable of the problem because it doesn 't show the spending of the ice .
The arctic sound calots is , in a sense , the clean , the clean of the global climate system .
You expanded up winter and ritira of extreme .
The next slide will be a quick carrelated to the advantage of the last 25 years .
The paces perenized stage .
You see , they expanded up to the blue scall .
That 's the winter in the winter , which is rhyth-win-great-winter .
You can see that the cosidged ice , of five years or more , is like blood , which is like blood , which is like blood .
In 25 years , it 's been like that .
This is a problem because the restage of the glacier around the world of the arctic ocean where there are enormous amounts of carbon that , and you 're going to turn into the microbes .
Right to the totality of the atmospect of global warming , that amount of global warming , that could doubled , overwhenever we 're going to be removed .
In some little deep sources in Alaska is already rebolling from water .
The professor professor of Alaska University of Alaska , a team in a team of a flow last horse .
Video : Wow ! Al Gore : Look is good . The question is if we 're also going to be we 're going to .
One reason is that this termal exchange change the Groenland from the northern North .
This is a glacial river .
The landed never reached to levels .
This is the Kangerlussuaq , in the southwest of the Groenland .
If you want to know how to be the sea level for the sea level of the ice packs on the sea level of the sea .
These run run out quickly .
The other side of the planet : Antarctica , the greatest block of ice the planet .
The month of scientists have dichieve that the bilannotion of the ice is in the negative , and that the Antarctica , which poging on some islands , is particularly fastly in the waste of the month .
Equal to six feet of the sea level , like Groenland .
The Himalayas , the largest third block of ice , you see new laghi , which was a few years ago .
40 percent of the world population is rich half of the world 's population .
Sulle Ande : this glacier is the source of the water source of this city .
The landed is increased .
But when you diminues , the same happens to the water water .
In California , the nenow on Sierra Nevada is diminuity .
The idrices are in crisis .
The predictions , like you 've been good .
The growing sses in the world leads to a remarkable remarkable .
The environmental disasters are increasing a rhythm out of the normal and without precedented .
Four times more numbers in the last 30 years , respect to 75 .
This is a whole way of all insustainable .
If you look at the historic context if you can see the consequences .
We 've added 70 million tons of CO2 every 24 hours -- 25 million tons of CO2 every 24 hours in the ocean every day .
Look at the time of the oriental Pacific , from the Americans , to the west west , and on both of the substent of the Indian of the oxygen in the ocean .
The major cause of global warming , together to deforestation , which is the 20 percent , is the fossil fuel .
Our oil is a problem , and the carbon is even worse .
The United States are one of the two more emissions , together to China .
And you 'd propost to build a lot of other carbon .
But we 're seeing in a direction changes .
These are anullated projects in the last few few green projects of green alternative projects .
Everything , there 's a political lower in our country .
The carbon industry and oil have spent 250 million dollars in the last year to promoting carbon , which is a bunch .
The picture of me , I 'd remember something --
Natal Verice , in Tennessee , where I saw , there was a loss of 3.8 billion liwalls of carbon .
You might have seen it on the news .
This is the largest flow of last flow in America .
It 's happened around the Natal .
The nalization of one of the carbon industry was this .
Video : I 'm going to be a high kind of allegrand happy .
It 's abundant here in America , and it 's growing our economy .
Frosty the carbon .
It 's good price , adorable and working on the wasts .
Al Gore : From here is a lot of the West Virginia .
The biggest mineral society on the mountains is Massey Coal . This is his administrator .
Video : Don Blakenship : I 'm going to have a Gore , Nancy Pelosy Pelosy , they 're talking about .
Al Gore : So , the Alleance for Protextion of Clima has launched two campaign .
This is a part of them .
Video : Actor : ALergy : ALergy , as a minacting slower to our business .
So our priority is to invest a large amount of money in a advertising , to make public and confused the truth and confused the truth .
In fact , the carbon is not sporite .
We think it 's clean -- it 's also a good profum .
So , you don 't precuse of the climate change .
Let me do it .
Video : Actor : Carbone . You 've heard a lot of them .
So let 's take a lot of a turn into a facstructure of the board to the board .
Straordinary ! The machines are a little rumorous , but this is the sound of the pulit technology of carbon .
The carbon consumers is between the main cause of global warming , but the remarkable of carbon heavily that you see all .
You look at a look at : this is the hodiergn of carbon .
Al Gore : From , the positive alternative of the economic issues and the national security .
Video : National America is in crisis , the economy , safety national security , the climate crisis .
The file connects all of the : our dependence from fossil fuel combuyable , like the sporite and oil .
Now , there 's a new , audace solution to use it .
Repower : 100 percent of clean energy , in 10 years .
A plan to remain America to work , make sure , and make it more surance , and help stop the global warming .
Finally , a solution that babs to solve our problems .
Repower . You 're going to be more .
Al Gore : This is the last last one .
Video : How much of the energy to America .
One of the faster and faster and finally dependence of combuyable to kill our planet .
Compared : The future is here . Vent , a new energy network .
Compars number two : Negi investment for bunch of work .
Comment : Repower America . It 's time to be realists .
Al Gore : A old proverbio African says , " If you want to go fast , you go to fast , you go to fast fast .
If you want to go away , you go together . "
We need to go away , fast .
Thank you very much .
Last year at TED , I 've been a introduced in the HC .
And promise to go back to the way to travel out how the machine works .
So there was . And for the ones that we had no , the LHC is the largest scientific experiment ever there was a big scientific experiment ever there -- 27 kilometers of circles .
His task is to rererereturn the conditions that were less than a billion of the universe -- until 600 million times a second .
All that 's just environment .
This is the Ginevra .
We 're going to take these little Big Bang in the reflikers .
This is what I work . It 's called AS -- it 's large-foot . It 's about 44 feet and he 's a diameter of 22 feet .
This is an ATLAS , building this is an AS building so you can see proportions .
Today , we have to the time the first time we have acceso the machine for the first time .
And this picture was taken from ATLAS .
It was cause of immense festeggiving in control .
It 's an image of the first particles that had all done around the HC , entering in collision , in collision , with a part of the HC LHC , and spreading particles inside the reflights .
In other words , when we see that image 10 sleep , we understand that the machine worked , which is a great writory .
I don 't know if it was this to make us more or this , or that , when someone went on on Google and vide that the page was this .
That means we have a cultural impact over than the scientific impact .
At a week later , there was a problem with the machine , had to these file here -- these fixed here -- these flowers .
These files bring 13,000 amps when the machine works on the massive massive .
Now , technical technical between you will look at the children and say , " It 's not true . I 'm fixed too much . "
And they can do that when they 're very cosiddicks to be the webbs .
So , at least 271 degrees , at least 271 degrees , in the spring of the space between stars , these files can bring that running .
In one of the giuntures of the most novemile in the LHC , there was a phrain-the-year-old paper difeted .
So the file file , they surrounded them , and the 13,000 herself improvised a electricity .
This was the result .
Now this is even more impressive if you think that these magneti fish more than 20 tons , and that you 've been moving about 30 centimeters .
They 're damn about 50 magneti .
We had to take them , what we did .
We repressed them and traveled and traveled .
Now they 're rerehornating all of their place .
By the end of march the LHC is going to be again integral .
We 'll access it , and we 're expected to get data to justed and we 're going to continue to find out what the morning on the universe are the morning that are the universe .
Now , of course , in a way , these accidents return the dibate on the value of science and engineering in front of science and engineering in front of science and engineering in front .
I think the fact that the fact that it 's so hard , I think that 's the value of things like LHC .
I 'd like to end with the words of a English scientist , Humphrey Davy 's , which I guess , in difenjoy of his own Michael Faraday , his Michael Faraday , he said , " Nient is a long time for the progress of the human mind as the rich that the reenlies of science are definition , that there 's not a mysteries in nature , and that we don 't have any new world . "
Thank you .
I want to start to ask you to rethink about when , you 're playing cowle-up morning .
As you get to get them to get them and take them , and get them to be able and get them , you know , actually , you know , and you 're going to be able to think and solving the space .
The space reasoning is deeply connected to the way we understand in the world .
So , from the inspired use of our interaction with physical objects , together to my consultant Pats , and my collaborator Jeevan Kalanithi , I started to ask , " And if , when we use a computer instead of having the mouse of the mouse like pollyer that 's going to be able to ask , " We could trust to be a safe , we could trust to be able to be able to be the waste ,
and stage it to our please ?
The question was so interesting that we decided to explore the answer , building the answer , building Siftable .
In a few words , a Siftable is a big computer interactive as a cookie .
In a few words , a Siftable is a big computer interactive as a cookie .
You can move with the hand , you can see , " between them , " You can see them , you feel their movement and they have a screen and a radio wireless .
But most of them , are physical objects , like the morning , you can move to simply deal with them .
The Siftable is an example of a new tools to manipulate digital information .
And as they become more physical , consciousness , conscious , other , and as they become more physical , conscious , of how we die them , we can explore the other , we can explore new and different styles of interaction .
I 'll start with some simple example .
This Siftable is configured to show video : if you 're going to pay in a direction , video rush in a direction , video .
These interactive rats are awful of other .
If you affianches them , they 're interested in what they 're going around .
If they 're surrounded , they can see it and act a little bit .
If they 're surrounded , they can see it and act a little bit .
They also greatly their movement and inclination .
And then we realized that one of the interestingly implications of the interaction , we can use communicate with data , for example , " a color like if it was a liquid .
In this case , we have three Siftable configured as a bunch of grenice and I can use them to the color in the center , where you mix .
and I can use them to use to the color in the center , where you 're missing .
We 're too much , we can put a little bit of place .
I 'm also a beautiful chance of appreciation , like language , the mathematics and games where people can try to prove things , and you see the results of the results of the results of the results of the appreciated results .
Now I 'm --
This is a Fibonaccount that I do with a program of equations .
Here we have a words that 's a half between Scarabeer and Boboble .
Pratically , at every turnal turn-one letter from every Siftable , Pratically , at every turnal turnal of any Sifable , and as you 're looking for the words of control on a dictionary .
And then , after about 30 seconds they remix , and you have a new lecking set and new chance to try .
Thank you .
Here 's the children came to Media Lab , I did it in a way that I tried them and I went to a video .
They 're very liked .
And one of the interesting things like this kind of application is that you don 't have to give people a lot of instructions .
You just say , " Compons of words , " and they know exactly what to do .
Here 's what other people who are going to try .
This is our younger tester tester , there on the right .
It was actually wanted to impillling them .
They 're only in the morning , for him .
Now this is an application of a interactive chart .
We wanted to build a tool for the apprment of language Lui is Felix .
It can put new characters in the scene , by solving the Siftable .
It can put new characters in the scene , by solving the Siftable .
Here 's , it 's doing the sunlight .
Video : The sun is smile .
David Merrill : Now , he brought a treat the time .
Video : The horse treat .
Bel work ! Yeah !
So , you 're supposed to be able and enjoying close to interact with characters --
Video : Bau !
-- inventing your own story .
Video : Hey .
DM : It 's a final story with the open , and it can decide how you slow .
DM : It 's a final story with the open , and it can decide how you slow .
Video : Very cat .
DM : The last example I have time to show you is a tool , made of recent , to truck and execececectual .
It 's a tool , made of recent , to trpioning and make music .
The Siftable here from sounds like basic sounds , the bacteria .
Each one of these has four different variations , and you can choose to what to use .
You can also insert these sounds into a sequence from you can compories .
And I 'll just just take it to touch a sound and a sequence . "
These are actually actually able effects and the filter , like the reverbero and the filter .
The attacks to a specific sound and then inclens to travel it .
And then there are general effects like time and volume , that they 're going to be playing into the sequence .
Let 's look at how it works .
Video : We 're going to show a base in two Siftable sequence , we 're going to put a series , we add on the summarily .
Now I 'm going to put a bass line .
Video : DM : Now , I add percussions --
Video : And I 'll put the filter to bacteria , so I can control the effect from the vial effect from the vial effect .
Video : I can see the entire sequence of the internal sequence time from one side .
Video : And I 'm going to add the bottom to give more expression .
Video : I can recombine the sequence of the flight .
So I didn 't have to playing it before , but I can improve , make it longer or corn .
And now , finally , I can spend the whole sequence on the left Siftable to the left Siftable .
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is to build new new interfaces more and more and more sounds like our brain and the body .
And I 've got to show you one of the result of this path , and some chance we try to bring out of the lab .
The concept I want to put you is that 's coming from this new generation of designed objects to interact with digital media , which will bring information in our world in the way we want .
Thank you very much .
I don 't see the time I 'm talking to you all .
I 'm a writer .
I 'm going to writing books is my profession , but it 's more than that , of course .
It 's also love and the fashion and the fashion of my life .
And I don 't expect that it can change .
But , I said , something particularly happened in my life and my career , which brought me to recently the whole work .
The particular thing is that I 've been wrote this book , this biography called " Mangia , Prega , " Ama , " which is diversly by my books , and I 'm going to be a big , feelational , feelational , bestseller .
And the result is that everywhere to be now , people treatment treatment .
It 's true -- convicvictims , convicted !
They 're all about me , and they say , " Do you don 't have fear to do any better ?
You don 't have fear to keep write for all of life without being able to create a book that can be able to make someone ? "
that can be importance to someone ? "
It 's rush , you know .
But it could go worse , at the end of the one I remember that more than 20 years ago , when I started to say , I was an adolescent -- I wanted to be a writer .
I 'd put it up to the same reaction ,
And people said , " Don 't you temes to have success ?
Do you don 't have fear that the ulifeed to kill you ?
Do you don 't have fear to do this mestize for all of life without nothing to come out and die on a cue of dreams with the mouth of the stage of failure ? "
So , you know .
The answer -- the short answer to all these questions is , " Yes . "
You 're fear of all those things .
I 've always had fear .
And I also fear with a lot of other things that people couldn 't inherently .
As the algae and other things .
But , as I would write what I thought and I 'd like to say , and I would say , "
Is it rational ?
It 's logical that anybody who has to expected to be spended by a job that you feel born to do .
But what 's so specific in the creative impress that we have to be nervous about the mental health health health .
How my father , for example , he was a chemical engineer and I don 't remember one time in his 40 years of activity where they were asked if they were interested in their engineer ?
It was never -- that block of engineer John , how does it go ?
It didn 't work that , you know ?
Onestly , chemicals like a group of group they don 't have any of them , in the centuries , driven the reputation of being alcolized maniaces .
We 've been a lot of this reputation , and not just a writer , but creatives of all kinds of instainable .
And it 's not to look at the triad of the magnifet-deaths of the magnifet-century deaths , they die young young young people and often die for their hand .
And the ones that are not suiciates like to be really disfaced by their dunges .
Norman Mailer , before I die , in the last interview said , " Every my book killed me a little more than a little more , " an extraordinary affermonstration about the work of their life .
But we don 't bat when we feel that we 've heard these things so long that we 've been completely interiorized and accepted the notion that creativity and suffering are in some way , and that art , at the end , at the end , it will always condut the angosal .
And the question I want to take all of here today is , you know with this idea ?
You 're good to this thing -- because it 's also about a centimeter of me , not good for this support .
I think it 's odious .
And I think it 's also dangerous and I don 't want to see the perpetuated in the next century .
I think it 's better encourage our big creative minds of living .
And I surely to my case -- in my situation -- it would be very dangerous to start fighting towards that feeling of support , sugly dated circumstances that are in my career .
Of course -- I 'm pretty much young , I 'm pretty young , I 'm pretty much young , I 'm pretty much young .
I 've got about four decades of work in me .
And it 's very likely that anything that I 'm going to written out of the world like the work that I went out after my last book .
I 'm going to be slavery , because we 're all more or less friends here -- it 's likely to my own own .
Oh , Gesu , who thought !
You know this is the kind of thought that leads a person to start bing in the nine of the morning and I don 't want to do that .
I would keep going to continue to do this work that we 're doing this work that we 're doing .
So the question is the question , how ?
And so I think , after a lot of reflections , that the way to continue to write is to create a psychological construct , OK ?
I have to find a distance of security between me , which I 'm written , and my natural anxiety that I writing , and I was trying to figure out of the last time , trying to do that that we can see in the time , trying to find other company , trying to see if they could have some better ideas and more sane and sane , and I was healthy to see if they could have some of the best ideas and sane and sane ,
How to help people managed to manage the inerent emotivity of creativity .
And that research brought me to the ancient Grek and ancient .
Seguites because I 'm giving me out of the circle and then go back .
In the ancient Grek and ancient Rome -- people didn 't seem to believe that creativity came from men , OK ?
And it was thought that creativity was this spirit to look at deal and that they were in men from a few distant source and unknown , for distant reasons and unknown , for reasons and unknown .
The greats were called these spirits of creativity of creativity of creativity .
Socrate , amazing , he believed to have a saggeity from a wisdom that was a wisdom that was a wisdom that was a wisdom that was a wisdom that was a wisdom that was a wisdom that was a wisdom that was a wisdom that you were , amazing ,
The Roands were the same idea , but they called that kind of spiried as a spirit .
which is great , because Rohands didn 't think that a genius was somebody who was very smart .
They believe that a genius was this kind of devices that had literally believed in the murs of an artist study of a artist study of a little like elpho Dobby , and that they 're out of hired the job of the artist 's work of the work of the artist and models the result of that work .
Here 's a sense of -- here is the distance of which I 'm talking about -- that 's the distance of which I 'm going to protecting you from your work .
And they all knew that it was so that it worked , right ?
So , anti-artists who were protected by certain things , like , for example , too much narcise , no ?
If you could have your work was exceptional , you could all get the deserve , they all knew that they were helped by this incorporate genius .
If your failed work , it wasn 't your own , right ?
Everybody knew that was your genius to be a inhanded .
And so people han conceived creativity in Occent for a long time .
And then the Rinasure came and all of this big idea ; we put the human being in the center of the universe above all the way and the mysters and without any more leaving space creatures and no longer to leave space .
This was the principles of humanity and rational principles and people started thinking that creativity came out of the individed .
And for the first time in the story , you start to refly this or artist like a kind of a genius rather than a person with genius .
And I have to say , I think it was a big mistake .
I think I allow someone , a simple person to believe that they 're like a recipient as a recipient source , the essence and source of all the mysters , creatives , and that 's a responsibility , and that 's a very much responsibility to the human beings .
It 's like to ask someone to enjoy the sun-like sun .
Deform and destaures , and they 're going to create all these ingestable expectations on performance .
And I think it 's been this pressure to have destroyed the artists in the past 500 years .
And if this is true , and I think that 's the question , and I think that 's the question , and now ?
Can we we do that .
Maybe I 'll go back to a more anticultural understanding of the relationship between humans and mystery .
Or maybe no .
Maybe we can 't downnn-year-old rational thinking in a 18 minutes .
And there 's probably people in the audience that would be legitimate sospects on the notion of , suspects , make that followed people spects in their projects .
I 'm going to not convinced you all about this thing .
But the question I 'd like to bring is -- why not ?
Why don 't I think that way ?
Because it 's more sense of everything that I 've ever heard to explain the exaspersual imprevehicbility of the creative process .
A process that , as anyone who ever tried to do something -- so , basically , you 're all here -- you 're not compored .
And , in fact , it can sometimes seem to be completely paranormful .
I did this inagainst recently in the extraordinary Ruth Stone , who has now 90 years , but that 's a poet for all of life and said that during his infants in the rural Virginia , working out in the camps , and I felt it , in if , when a poetry of the poetry .
He said that was like a fragorous tracks .
And that was rotoling towards her from the landscape .
I felt that , because he was to tremendous , because he was going to be able to get out of his feet .
He knew I had one thing to do to do at that point and was of , " Where , " run like a matta . "
And so he would correct back to the home and he was going to be able to take a piece of paper and he wouldn 't have to get a piece of paper and a math , and it was pretty fast by the way , and to erve it on the page .
Sometimes I couldn 't be fast enough , so he goes out and correcrecreceived and correcrect without getting to get to the home and the poetry and she would continue to rotolar through the landscape , to keep rotolating through the landscape , to like , " one poet . "
And then there were those times -- this piece of not deal with -- there were some moments where the almost lossing , right ?
So , he was running home and he was trying to try and the poetry went through , and he was going through , and then he said , that was going , and then he said , that was like if you 're alone one one of the hand and the steffuffed .
He was the poetry of the poetry , and he remain his body and the page on the page .
And in these cases , the poetry would be presented on the perfect page , and the last word to the last word to the first .
So when I felt I thought -- it 's really nesigual , it 's exactly the same same thing my creative process .
Not all my creative process -- I 'm not a conducted .
I 'm a mule , and my way to work is , you know , you know , I 'm going to take me and get up and get up and get up and get up there .
But even I 'm in my aggin , I 've been striped against that thing , sometimes .
And I guess that I 've also got a lot of you .
You know , even though the work and ideas came to me from a certain source , you can 't be honestly saperformance .
And what is this thing ?
And how can we relate to it in a way that we don 't lose the head , but rather , that makes us remain ?
And as I 'm about , the best example of the time I 'm the musician of Tom Waits , which I 've been different years ago for a day .
We were talking about this , and you know , Tom , for the largest majority of life was the incarnation of the artist tomented in the time , to control , dominating these species of impults .
But then I 'm going to invecent , and one day , and one day , as he was driving on a highway in Los Angeles , he changed it for him .
He was going to be fast and all of a tract of this little fragment of melodia , that comes in in his head as the inspiration , and the wallpoints , and the wants , you know , it 's wonderful , and the desider doesn 't know how to take it .
It doesn 't have a piece of paper , he doesn 't have a math , he doesn 't have a recorder .
So I 'm going to feel this kind of old old old species growing in him , " I 'm going to lose , and I 'm going to remarried to lose .
I 'm not good enough and I can 't do it . "
And instead of going to go into the panic , you stop .
I 'm going to be able to be completely new .
I 'll just just the sky and said , " Scuses , you don 't see that I 'm driving ? "
" Do you look at a song now ?
If you really want to exists , you get out of a more opporting , you know ,
At , you go to importantly someone else today .
You 're going to disturbing Leonard Cohen . "
And his process changed after this .
Not the work , the work was still dark like .
But the process , and the fish that was remajor was refleaved when the genius was refused when the genius , the genius that was going to go back from where it was going to come from where , making it .
But you know , this peculiar , wonderful bizarre playing a conversation between Tom and this strange and outside that it was not Tom .
So , as I felt that story started to change a little bit of the way I was working and I 'm sure I was saved .
This idea , I 'm going to save me when I was writing , " Ama , " and fall in one of those cave of the disperation where we 're working on something and we 're working on something and we 're not able to do it and we 're not able , and we 're going to start thinking that 's going to be the worst book .
Not just bad , right , right the worst book written .
And I started thinking about giving this project .
But then I remember Tom who talked to the air and I tried to you .
So I went to my face on the wild manuufacturing and decrease my commments to a vacuum of the room .
And I said to get up , " Sents , what , you 're going to be brilliant not to be a brilliant not to be quite fairly colm , no ?
Because as I see I 'm putting all of that I have , I don 't have this .
So if you want to be better , you have to presented you and do your side .
OK . But if you don 't do it , you know what I don 't do it .
I 'm going to write the same because it 's my work .
And I 'd like to please that was that I 've been presented to do my part of " because -- finally , OK -- I 'm doing in the end of the North Africa people were damn for dance damly dance , damly , dance and music that they were going on to the stuff .
And they were always magnifies , because the ballerins were professionals and they were great .
But every time , rarely , something happened , and one of these artists became transcendent .
And I know what I 'm talking about , because I know you 've all seen , at a point , a performance so .
It was like if the time , and the ballernly walked through a kind of baller-and-up , and it was doing nothing else from solved from solved , but it was all all all of them .
And suddenly , not just like a human .
But it 's accese out of the divinity in the windges of divinity .
And when this happened , the time , the people knew what was , they called him .
They were going to give their hands and they started to dotor , " Allah , Allah , God God , " God , " God , " God , "
That 's God , you know .
And I was historic named -- when the Muinvaded Spain , I was this abitude with them and pronounce changed in the centuries of " Allah , Allah , " to " to " Ole , " to " the " Ole , " which you can still feel in the corries or in the flamk .
In Spain , when a artist did something impossible and magic , " Allah , " Allah , " By , " incomprehed , " incomprehed , " uncomprensible , which is a last of God .
And it 's great because we need .
But the problem comes the day , for the ballerin the same , when you wake up and discovering that are the 11 of Martedday and the last 11 of God 's morning and the last of God .
It 's just a mortal with gran bad hurge , and maybe it 's not going to get that altitude .
And maybe nobody 's going to lead to God , and what do you have to do with the rest of his life ?
It 's hard .
This is one of the most painful recognize to make in a creative life .
But perhaps it doesn 't have to be so angoscious if you can 't believe , mostly , and the most expensive aspects of your being from yourself .
But you might just believe that they 're being data in prested by an inimaginable source of this team in part of your life that 's going to go to someone else .
And , you know , if we think that 's all changes .
And so I started thinking about , and it 's sure , and it 's just like I thought for several months in the work of the book that I 'm going to be doing , the dangerous , attesissued , attesissued , attesissues followed my big success .
And what I have to continue to me when I feel electritried by this is , it 's not not fear .
Not just just the way . It 's just your work .
You can see your own part of your side , any can be .
If you 're working with your work is ball , you know .
If the divine , I 'm assurd to you assigned to leave you some kind of wonderful , for one moment through your effort , then " Oh , " Oh , " Oh , " Oh , " Oh , " Oh , " Oh , " Oh , " Oh , " ! "
Every few , you do the same dance .
And " Ole ! " You know , " at you .
I think , and I think I should teach it .
" Ole ! " at you , even only for having human love and testing tals from a tali of the tals from getting to present you continue to be .
Thank you .
Thank you .
June Cohen : Ole !
As I 've already talked about some of these projects on the human genome , what can mean and on the discovery new set of genoes .
Now we 're starting to digitalize biology and now we started to digital biology and now we 're coming from that digital code we 're coming into a new phase of biology , designing and synthesize life .
We 've always tried to bring big questions .
" What is life ? " is something that many biologists I think of biologists have tried to understand vary .
We 've tried different approaches , reduced to the minims .
We 're digitizens from almost 20 years .
When we sequenced the human genome was treated to go from the analome of biology to the digital world .
Now , we can regenerate life , or create new life from this digital universe ?
This is the map of a small organism , Mycoplasma genitalium , which is the smallest genome of the smallest genome of the lab .
And we tried to reduce the genome to believe one more little bit .
We 're able to eliminate a hundred genes of genes of about 500 that are here .
But when we look at his metabolic map , it 's relatively simple respect to our .
I think , this is simple .
But when we look at all the genes that we can eliminate , one one at the time , it 's very unlikely that this can bring to a living cells .
So we decided that the only way to progret was synthesize this chromosoma in a way that we could get the components to bring some of these fundamental questions .
And so we started the adventure of " Can we can synthesize a chromosome ? "
Can you confeed chemistry to make these big molecules that we never have to create before ?
And in case , in a deal , we can make a chromosome ?
A chromosome is just a piece of chemical material , inert ,
The speed that we 're digitize to grow life is growing to refly exponential .
Our capacity to write the genetic code , instead , progrecially , but it 's improving .
And our recently results the result of an exponential curve .
We 've got more 15 years ago .
The process of require a lot of passages , starting with a biothetic revision before we started the first experiments .
But we found that synthesize DNA is very hard .
There are tens of thousands of machines in the world that produced small segments of DNA , the long longer than the segment is a degenerative process : the more than the segment is long , more erors are there .
So we had to develop a new method to assembly these framments and correct the erors .
And this was our first attempt , to partician , from the digital genome of Phi 174 .
It 's a little virus that kills bacteria .
We designed the fragments , effectuated the correction of the mistakes and get a molecule of DNA .
The interesting part is when we took this piece of chemical material , and we 've got it in bacteria , the bacteria have started reading this genetic code and produring the viral particles .
The viral particles have been refed by cells , they went back and they 've come back and they have the Eccles .
I 've been talking about recent with a half of the oil industry from saying they have to them that they have certainly compressed this model .
They have more than you .
We believe this is a situation where the software can actually actually build his same hardware in a biological system .
But we wanted to do things in big .
We wanted to build the entire chromosome of the bacteria .
They 're over 580 mile of genetic code .
So we thought of building this in the size of the virus , so we can change the cassets to understand what are the components of a living cells .
The design is crucial , and if we start with digital information in a computer , these have to be very accurate .
When we sequenced this genome for the first time in 1995 accurate advanced this genome was a mile for every 10 mile .
We found out , we would resequence , 30 mistakes . If we had that original sequence would never be able to work .
One part of the process is designing 50 letting up the long time , 50 letting out of the other segments of 50 letters to build subunits small small tops working together .
We 're going to try to the unique elements here .
You probably read that we 're going to read that we 're going to be serious .
So , think , we have a genetic code on four letters : A , C , G and Ts .
Three of those letters in the letters together about 20 advance 20 adicals , and there 's a specific order to be an extra spreading for every friend .
So we can use genetic code to write words , frasasases , thinking .
What we 've done in the beginning is autograped to do this .
Some of them were dollar from the fact that it wasn 't poetry .
We designed these segments to just just just just to only only only one with enzymes .
There are some of them repair and put them them .
And we started assembly to assembly parts , starting with segments from five to seven mile , and then then labundges in a way to form segments to them back to 72 mile them .
We 've got these check segments in abundance so that we 're trying to create an extent that we 're trying to create an extremely robbblindly -- as you 'll see in a minute .
We 're trying to automatize the process .
So this seems to be the tabellon of a low--bowet .
When we get these very long segments , the more than 100 mile , they will not grow more directly in the Ecclusters .
You get to the modern limits of the modern biology .
So we 've been considered other mechanisms .
We knew about another mechanism called a homologa , which in biology , and in biology to repair the DNA to repair the DNA to be able to fix segments .
Here 's an example .
This organism , called Deinococcus radiodurs , can absorbed three million rad of radioduring .
You can see in superior as his chromosome like the destroyed .
In 12 -- 24 hours , it 's been replaced as much as it was .
There are thousands of organisms that they 're able to do that .
These organisms can be completely .
They can live under vacuum .
They 're absolutely sure that life in space , and you feel places to find new rich environments of water .
ASA showed the NASA showed that this is .
This is an image of molecule that we 've built out using these processes , just using the lik-up design of appropriate design of the inseries of segments .
The likely self-assemble .
This picture wasn 't taken with a mand-to-digit , but with a regular microscope .
It 's a molecule that we can see with a slide of launch .
These are photo cover a period of about six seconds .
This is the advertising that we did a little time ago .
They 're over 580,000 letters of genetic code .
It 's the largest molecule of a defined structure from man .
It 's got a molecular weight to 300 million .
If you stamp it with a 10 without spaces , we would like 142 pes , it would like to transcer this genetic code .
Now , how do we do it work ? How can we activate it ?
Of course , you tramed a virus is a game from kids .
It 's a little more complicated when they use bacteria .
It 's easier when it 's euliar cells like our eucariote as our one , you can just extract the nucleus and insert one else , which is basically the process of cloning .
In the bacteria , the chromosome is integrated inside the cell , but we 've recently demonstrated that we 're able to do a complete chromosome of chromosome from a cell cell of another and activity .
We can clear a chromosome from a microbial species .
The two are different as men from the topes .
We 've added some gene in a way that we can decide what to do for this chromosome .
And then I 'm skied with the enables so to kill all the protects .
And when we put it in the cells is stupendown-to-year-old our subfisticatoday -- the new chromosome .
And we were thinking that we couldn 't go beyond , but we 've tried to spinger us in there .
This is one of the major mechanisms of evolution .
We found that many species have added in a second or a chromosome , or chromosome , added in a second thousand tracts to the species .
So who thinks about evolution as one gene , as one time you 're going to be a lot of biology .
They 're going to be restring for restrength that I 'm going to get to digerve DNA .
The chromosome that was in the cells that doesn 't have one .
The cell phula-se-chromosome that we have a fire-year-old cutter-year-old cutter-year-old cell .
You 're expressed , and it recognized the other chromosome like material material , has masticated it , and we 've been recognized with only the cell and the new chromosome .
It became blue because of the genes that we 've got a lot .
And in a short ort ort amount of time , all the characteristics of a kind of went to perse , and it 's transformed in a new kind of , based on the new software that we 've insered in the cell .
All the protects have changed , the membranes have changed , and when we read the genetic code .
Now this may seem to look at genetic , but altering the DNA software , we can change the way .
Now , I 've already explained that there 's not about genesesis -- but to go from three million years and a half of evolution , and I said that maybe we 're perhaps going to create a new version of Cambrian explosion in which will be created new species on this digital process .
Why do that ?
I think it 's pretty obvious when we think about our needs .
We 're going to move from six billion and a half billion people in the next 40 years .
Right to give an example : I was born in 1946 .
Now there are three people on the planet for every none in 1946 ; there will be four .
We 're having problems now to find food , fresh water and clean , medical and well-and-a-half billion and a half of people .
It 's going to be more than to do that for nine billion .
We use more than five billion carbon carbon , more than 30 billion baries .
That means percent million baries a day .
When we try to find biological processes , or any kind of process to return them , it 's going to be a huge challenge .
We have to keep the whole whole emission of CO2 ef of these materials that 's going to end in the atmosphere .
At day , thank you to scientific discoveries in the world , we have a database with about 20 million genes , and I like to think that are the designed components for the future .
The electronic industry only has a dozen about components , and think about how many different things are coming out .
Our limitations here are principles of biology and our imagination .
Now we have techniques , because of these rapidly synthetization , in order to create what we call genomics .
We 're able to build a big robot that can produce a million chromosome a chromosome a day .
Think about 20 million genes of genes or to try to get to get to get either or drugs , new vaccines , and we can change , thank you , thank you very small team , and create more biology . So , we can change , thankly in the last 20 years of science .
And it 's just a standard selection .
We can choose to be choose for survival , chemical production or carburant , production of vaccines .
This is an instantaneous instantaneous software programmed that we 're working on to be able to seat-to-up and designing species in the computer .
Well , we don 't know how to be .
We know exactly how the genetic code .
We 're now focusing on the fourth of the fourth cool .
You 've also seen you to extract ethanol from the gran experiment ,
We have carburant and third generation that 's going to use enough to be hseveral carbons than the tremendous towels , or different kinds of value like the either either of the tremendous amount of .
But the only way that biology can have a big impact impact without increasing more about food and limitary the cost of food and limitary would transform CO2 in matter before , so that we 're working on to design cells that we can get the first carbon , and we think we can have the first carbons of the quarter of the generation of the quarter in about 18 months .
The solar light of the CO2 is a metodo-- but in our discoveries of the world , we 've found different metods .
This is a organism that we 've described in 1996 .
It 's in the deep ocean , about 2,500 feet of depth to the temperature of the water .
They create meter from CO2 molecular idrogenius , as a way of energy .
We 're trying to figure out if we can incanalate CO2 , which can easily be translated tramed with tubes , to drive that CO2 carbon , to drive this process .
So , we think that we might be able to increase what we could be able to increase what 's the basic question of " which is Noi , greatest -- we have the goal of the boxes of the oil industry .
Exactly . If you can 't do that from TED , where you can ?
It would be a main of energy source .
And we 're working on using the same metods to to create vaccines .
You 've seen this year with influence , we 're always going to go back and with a dollar in less when it 's about finding the win .
I think what you can change is building vaccines in ancient ent vaccines in anticipate .
Here 's how the future may be changing , now , the tree of evolution , accellerating evolution with synthetic bacterial cells , and infinally cell cells .
We 're so far from the improving people .
Our purpose is to do that way to live long enough to try to get it . Thank you very much .
First of all of you to see , the fastest , some fundamental work , of the new technology that we brought to a acquire almost a year ago . This is Seadragon .
It 's a environment where you can interact is at the local level that you can interact with a huge amount of data .
Here we 're seeing a lot of gigabyte of digital phoom with a kind of photos and continuous , for a fast panoric , avoid spent the images like we want .
And not matter how much the amount of information that we see , how big the amount of information , or images .
Most are common photographs , but this for example , is a scanning from the Biary of Congress , and recently in the gam-megaxing gamel .
It doesn 't make any difference because the only thing that limits of a system like this is the number of pixel on your screen in any time . It 's also a very flexel on your screen in any time . It 's a very flexible .
This is an interior , example of data not images .
This is the Casa desolate of Dickens . Every colonn .
To show you that 's just about textbook and not images , we can do something like that , to see that it 's a real real representation of the textbook , not a picture .
It could be a little artificial way to read a electronic book .
Not the advice .
This is an example more realistic example . It 's a number of the The Guardian number of .
Every picture is the beginning of a sexual .
And it really gives you the pleasure and the beautiful experience of the version cartacea 's version of a magazine or a quotidian , which is for a molteplice .
We also did something with the corner of this number in particular number of the The Guardian .
We 've created a high-resolved advertising ads -- much more than that you use in a normal advertising advertising .
If you want to see the characteristics of this automobile , you can see here .
Or other models , or even the specific techniques .
And this really demonstrates some of these ideas to eliminate the limits of space on the screen .
We hope that this means to be able to end up with a few up and other porcheries , we don 't have to be necessary .
Of course , the map is one of the most obvious applications for this kind of technology .
And on this is not going to lose time , if I don 't mean we have contribute to give them in this field .
These are all the streets in the United States subvil over an picture of NASA .
So , let 's go to something else .
This is actually actually actually from the face on the web ; you can go to see .
It 's a project called Photosynthy , which combine two different technologies .
One is Seadragon and the other is a very interesting visual computer in Noah Snavely , a student of the University of Washington , with the aid of Steve Seitz of UW Szz Rick Szi Szi Rick Szi 's Microsoft Rick . " A collaboration . "
And it 's from the journal of Seadragon .
You can see that when we do this kind of screreen , where we can go from an image to the other image and have this kind of a source of the way .
But the spatial location of the images here has actually a meaning .
The algorithms of the computer visualization that 's recorded these images together , so that they have to go to the real places that I 've been -- all sscaten in the Rockies , and these are on the Rockies -- they 're screen . Here we give you a de-stroke of the elements of a de-show , and these things are all the spacting level . And these things are all the spactable of spactic level .
I don 't know if I have time to show you some other environment .
There 's some more spacective .
I want to go directly to one of the original data of Noahs -- and this comes from a prototype of Photosynthy that we 've done for the first time , last summer last summer , to show you what 's really the key behind this technology , the Photosynthize this technology , the technology is going to be able to look at the environments that we have put in the website .
We had to worry about legal aspects and forth .
This is a reconstruction of Notre Dame images in Flickr . Bao digital digitrom Notter in Flickr and you get images of types of the field campus and saying . Ogning . Ogning of these areas . And that 's a of these areas .
So they 're all taken by Flickr and they 're all of the spatial level in this way .
And it 's possible to navigate this way .
You know , I never thought I 'd never been to end to work for Microsoft .
It 's very gratificent receive this kind of accoenage here .
I think you can see that it 's a lot of different types of photos : from those of the ones of the SLR , a meaning , a meaningful number of meaning , put together in this environment .
And if I can , I 'm going to try to look at those strange .
Many are blocked by faces , etc .
Somewhere you find a series of photographs -- there 's a series of photographs -- there .
This is a Nototer poster of Dame recorded correctly .
We can go from the poster to the physics of this environment .
The essential point is that we can do with social environment . This is now taking data from the sudden of the collective of how the Earth looks like the Earth , from the visual point of view -- and connects to all those data together together .
All those pictures become connected together , the greater than the sum of the parts .
You have a model of the land that emerge .
Think about this as a prolungation of Stephen Lawler 's work on Earth .
It 's something that grows in complexity as a man who are using it , and the advantage of those people who use it to use it .
Their pictures are marked with inseries of other people .
If someone comes the idea of contract of all these things are saying the name of the Notter 's cheap of Notter Day improvised to be able to get to all those data , and I can use of those data , and I can use of the way to immergerms to the space , using the pictures of anyone , and having a social social experience of a kind of cross-to--user experience of like a cross-user .
Of course , a consequence of all this is virtual models of all over the way , the early virtual models of every interesting part of the earth , and from satellitar images and that , but from the collective memory .
Thank you .
Chris Anderson : I 've got good ? What what your software is that you 're going to have to do is that at a certain point , in the next few years , all share they share they connected with ?
BAA : Yeah . What 's doing is actually to find out .
It 's creating hyperlink , if you want , you 're going to be in images .
And it 's doing it in the basis of the images .
The thing becomes very interesting if you think about the wealth of semantic information that many of these images .
As you 're doing a research of the web , you have a phrase and the texage on the webbs , it 's a lot of information about the picture .
Now , what happens if that picture is you connected to all of your pictures ?
So the amount of interconnection and the amount of wealth and the amount of wealth is really enormous . It 's a classic effect of the network .
CA : Blaise , it 's really incredible . Compedents .
BAA : I thank you very much .
One of the main pleasure when you travel and one of the thetnographics of the thetnographics is the living in between who has no antial lessons , between who 's wind , you touch the past in the wind , the stone tommouth , the wind the levert-handed plant .
Basts thinking that the sciamans Jaguar vividrusted . The Lattea , or that the anthrows are still collied by the way , or that in Himalayas , the budddysts , they 're still still in the respire of the Charma , to remember the importance of the world 's central anthly , and that the idea that the world in which the world 's not a model , but it 's just a model of reality , but it 's just a model of reality ,
the consequence of a particular adaptative choices that our own own has done , well or bad , many generations ago .
And , of course , we all share of essential tracts .
We all have . Everybody probelieve .
We 're subjects to start .
We have to death the inexorability of death , so we don 't surprise if we 're going to save and wheless ,
We all have a art .
What hits is the particular rhythm of the song , the rhythm of the dance of every culture .
Not the matter that they 're the Penan forests of the Borneo , or the following of the Vodoo 's the Kenya , or the desert Kenya , or the desert Kenya , or a cameras .
He was my journey of journey in the desert a month ago , or a yak in the Canthomolanger , on the Everest , the dea mother of the world .
All these people teaching us that there are other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , other ways in the world .
And if you think , if you think , it 's a concept that it can give you hope .
And together , the myriaths of cultures of the world creating a spiritual life of the world creating a cultural life of the planet and it 's important for the benbe of the planet as a nice of biology note as biosphere .
And you can think about this cultural ragnosphere , as a thetnosphere , and you can defined the throwth of all the concepts , dreams , dreams , ideas , inspiration , intuitions , inspired ,
The thetnosphere is the fantastic patriage of humanity .
It 's the symble of what we 're and what we can be in how much kind of inquisitive species .
And because the biosphere was gravly consumed as a fer has been made to the thetnosphere and unfortune .
Nothing , for example , that would say that 50 percent of all the species was or the orders of all the species , just because it 's fake , or or -- in the most apocaly-poweresis -- in the world of biology of biological diversity -- and you don 't even even even even close to the most optimistic issue .
The indeed of this is , of course , the language persites .
When you were born 6,000 language on this planet .
A language is not composed to just a vocabolary or by a series of rules .
A language is the sprying of the human spirit .
It 's the middle of the animal of every culture comes into the material world .
Every language is a forest of mind , a backin , a thought , a spiritual ecosystem .
And of those 6,000 language , as we 're here sedded to Monterey , at least half the horeck is not susurred in the ears of children .
They 're not teaching kids to , the people who want to say , to less that we chad , that 's already death .
What 's more sad than being aved from the silence , of being the last to talk to a language , of being the last talk to a language , of the sagdom of the children ?
This is a faced of someone in the world in some part of the world every two weeks : every two weeks a old mur and he 's going to hold the tomble of the last silly .
And I know somebody 's going to say , " isn 't it better ?
The world wouldn 't be a better place if we 're all talking about the same language ? " Well , then we talk all talk about the yoruba . We talk about the dotone-year-old place .
We talk about kogs .
You 'll be a tract thing to say we can 't talk to your language .
I 'd like to give you a journey through the journey --
a little journey in the etnosphere to give you a bunch of what we 're losing .
Many of us forget that when I say , " different ways of existing , " I mean , " that 's different ways of exists .
We take for example this baby Barasana , in Amazonia , the popular anaathe-anacond , which crees the myth of provide of saconest in the sandwest pants of sacres .
It 's a popular popular that 's not able to distinguess color by the green blue from the green green , because the time you 're identified in the forest .
They have a strange language and a matrimonial rule , called " exogamia " explistic language , " you have to marry a different language .
All of this drugs in the past mitologic , yet the participate is that in these families and extend to be six or seven language of multiple cause of the mystons of nobody that 's a language .
They 're going to listening and then they start talking .
We take one of the most interesting tribes I have been visited , Waorani of Ecuador north , an incredible popular popular people who had the first contacts in 1958 .
In 1957 five missionary missionary contact a factor .
They did that they were going to take them out of the photographs that they were going to refly , forest that this popular of pluvial forest .
They collected the picture from the earth , they 've been going to be a shape or a figar and , not finding that they were treated with the diavroots .
But Waorans don 't kill the strange .
They killed them between them .
54 percent of the mortality was caused by them .
We 're going to eight generations and we found two natural morning and we found two natural morath and when we 've been insisted to know that they were inveced , and then they were invecently aging , and then they were killed it the same .
The crumers were able to recognize the animal urine from 40 steps and recognize the species .
In the early ' 80s , I 've been assigned a really interesting task when my professor of Harvard , if I wanted to go Haiti to Haiti to sweapons of the potence of Duvalier and Tonton the tape of the Tonton Macoutes , and impossesses of the velenjoyed to make the sleaves of the vels .
To give a sense of a miraccolost , I 'd have to understand the Vodoo culture , and that the Vodoo not .
It 's pretty much about a complex vision of metaphical vision of the world .
Many interesting .
If I would ask you to tell me the big religions of the world , what would you say ?
Cristianesimum , Islam , Buddislove , Ebraism , etc .
A continent is always left out , thinking that the sub-Saharan Africa doesn 't have religious feels . And they 're and the Vodoo is not the other than the distilside of these religious concepts of nated religious concepts in the tragic tragic .
What makes the interesting vote is the intense rush is the intense race between life and death .
So , they 're going to hide the spirits .
The spirits can be invoced by the Great Grande Acqua , they resident to the rhythm of the dance of the vial soul in a short way that for a short short , the following becomes the goal .
So , for this voodooists like to say , " You white , you go to talk about God .
We say , we 're going to deal with the time and we say God . "
And from the moment you 're married , is the spirit that you 're driving , as you can be bad ?
So you 're seeing incredible event : follow vote voodoo in the state of trance that touches are impunted a demonstration , rather strongly force of the power of mind when it 's catalized in a state of extreme .
You 're all the people with which I 've been visited the most extraordinary Kogi of Sierra Nevada Santa Marta Marta , in the Santa Marta Marta .
Design civilization that sometimes they were living on the caraiss-to-plug of the Colombia in the securrent of the Colombia , the populor the people were going on the wild planning planning .
In a drued continent blood , this popular has never been conquisted by the spagened .
But there are some of the time , but their formation is really extraordinary .
The young people following come from the families to three or four years , and they live secreged in a good world and share in a world of buy homball on the basis of the ice for 18 years .
Two dy-nine years of proposition to reproduce the nine months of the rules that transformation in the user-year-old horically in the uter of the Grande Mother .
For that time , they 're accultured to the values of their society , values that make their prayers and only their prayers to keep the cost of ecological balance .
At term of this incredible initiation , they 're suddenly landed out and for the first time in their age of 18 years , they see a dress . And in that account of the first ball of the way , when the sunlight is the values of the beautiful landscape , all that we 've been learned in theory . And the first time , the predict of that 's going back and say , and he 's saying , and he 's saying , and he 's saying ,
" Where ? Right ? Right ? I said ,
It 's amazing . Now it 's about you protect it . "
They 're called greaters and they say that we , brothers , and they 're the destroys , we 're the destroyed by the destroys .
This level of intuition is extremely important .
When we think about the Ingene populations and the invoice of the Rousseau and the old story of the noble wage , which is a razer concept in his simplicity in his simplicity , we say that these populis closest near to the Earth .
Ingenes are not no feeled feelings are not feeled by the nostalgam .
There 's no space for these things in the Asmalls of the Asmat the Tibet , but thanks to the Tibet , but thank you to go through the Earth , they created a mystics of the Earth 's Earth 's not about the concept of the Earth 's neighbor on an intuition of the idea that the Earth can live with the consciousness .
What does it mean ?
It 's going to say , a girl of the Ande who grows up to believe that the mountain is a spirit of Apu who 's going to be a destiny different , and it will have a different human being deeply different , and it will have a different mass of rocks to a little bit different with the mountain with the mountain of rocks to be a mass of rocks of a mass of rocks is going to be a slead .
That 's the dimall of a spirit or a mineral cutting is irrelevant .
What 's interesting is the metaphor that defines the relationship between the individual and the natural world .
I grew up in the forests of the Columbia credly credying that forests to be cut .
And that made me a human being different from my friends Kwakiutl who believe that the forests are the Hukuk 's dise of Hukuk and the bhere 's historic bats that live in the world , we 're living in the world , spirits that they 're living in the Hamsa .
If you start to look at that these cultures can create different reality , you can start to understand some of their sensory discoveries .
I 've been taken this picture to april in the nordoctor Amazon the nordoctor .
Maybe some of you 've heard about ayahuasks , the most powerful stance psychoptic repertorium .
What makes it fascinating the ayahuasks is not the potential of the substance of the substance of the substance of the substance .
On the side , this liana launch that has a series of of beta-carbs , harvly and harmful , slightly hole .
Take the only plants has a blusted blusters that altera little bit of the consciousness , but it 's measured with the leaves of a coffee of the coffee of the coffee of the coffee Psychotridis .
This plant is a contains powerful triptamines , very similar to the serotonin , methyptamine-5 , methoxydimethoxt-ptamine .
If you 're ever seeing Yanomami to pull up on the nose of the substance that they do from a different kind of species , anches contains a different kind of a methoxt-ptamine .
And I mean , I think about the birth is a little bit like to be disappeared by a paper of paper dipink , and landed on a electricity . [ Risate not creates a distorsion of reality .
I was a lot of my professor , Richard Evan Shultes , the man who has been sleep , with his discovery of the fungi , with his discovery of the fungi of the lower fungi of the lower fungi in the ' 30 in Mexico .
I think my teetthesis , you can 't classificate these triptamines like hallucinated because if you can 't tell anybody to be hallucinated . [ Risate ] . The tripamines lose can 't be assued by a tremendous lessly , because they 're dened by a zest monothly , in the intended .
It 's possible to be able to assumerly if you 're assus with other checchemicals that dens the MAO .
Now , the beautiful carboline that are the behind in this liana is in this liana are in this liana is the same kind of necessary to potential triptamines . The question is the spontaneous question : in a fle-hour . The question is the spontaneous question , how these people have to find two deales are not like that if you combinated in this way , creating a biochemical sum that 's superior to the sum of the parts of the parts ?
We use the great eupheral of the proof of the prove and the mistake that can reveal infrures .
But if we ask the Indians , they 'll say , " We 're talking about the plants . "
What does it mean ?
This tribes , the Cofan , has 17 variety of ayahuasks , which distinguess in the forest , and that our eyes would be in the forest .
If we ask them how to stbilize their tassonomed , " I was going to tell us , " I was thinking about the rest of plants ? " I said , " No . "
The solution is : you take the 17 variety in a night of a moon piena and each one will be with a different tone .
With this doesn 't have in Harvard , but it 's much more interesting than content stami .
Now , [ applausi is that even the problem of us that we have to heart popular people find their own heart of the margins , but somehow reducts our marines in the world , and pass of the story of the respect to our real world , and pass .
In fact , the 19th century , it doesn 't have to remember to their drives or the technologies , but rather as the one was where we stopped and we have actired and we 've been active and actively acked into the world of diversity and cultural diversity and cultural tural improved the planet . Now the problem is not the change .
All the cultures through the centuries have been involved in a new life for new possibilities of life .
And the problem is not the technology .
The Indians Sioux , they don 't have to be Sioux when they put in the arco and fly as they have been stopped by the horse and cutter .
It 's not the change or technology that they threw the integrity of the ethnosphere . It 's the power .
The hard flight of the domination .
And if you give a look at the world , you 'll find that these are not destinated cultures .
They 're living and dynamics , spints out of the identificable forces that go beyond their ability to adaptation .
I 'm sitting in the pathria of disboscary in the same same .
a popular nobble , in the south-west . In the air--year-old popular , a popular popular , and now reduced to a generation ago , and now reduced to the servitage of the rive of the rive of the southful Meridian , where you can see the river of Borneo Meridian Meridional Meridional Meric , where the nitches nable saughtforest ,
With the wood stone of the stone of the subject to the forest forest .
Or , in the Yanomami , are the disease that 's the removed with the golden of the golden of the golden .
If we move on on the Tibet of the Tibet , where I 'm doing a lot of research , you 'll see the hard hard flight .
As you know the genocide , the physics of a popular popular , is conducted to universal level , but the ethnocide , the destroyle of life 's life , not just is convicted , but advice it 's a popular .
And you can 't understand the Tibet is the Tibet of the Tibet .
I 've been there in the 6,000 miles from Chengdu in Choccicial China through Tibet , coming in Lhasa young colleague , but only came to Lhasa young colleague , but only came to Lhasn the statistics that I 'm talking about .
6,000 monuments sters reduced in the powers and cenjoyed .
1.2 million people killed by the military of the Cultural Rivolution .
The father of this guy was ascriticized to Panchen Lama .
That means that it 's been killed in the time of the Chinese invasion .
Her , it 's skied with Santity in Santity , in the diaspora that has brought the popular in Nepal .
Her mother was imprigioned and his colpe was to be rich .
It 's been brought to the age of two hidden in the age of two hidden under his gonna because he couldn 't live without him .
The sister , which did the same , it was mit in the education field .
A day he was a waste cofferigant , and for this transgated Mao and , for this transged , it was mit to seven years .
Tibet is insustainable , but the recently spirit , but the recently spirit .
And then , all of the fall , you reduce to a choice .
We want to live in the monocromath of the monothoonia or we want to accoach the world ?
The big anthropologists Margaret Mead , before he said that his greatest fear was that , in our way to this view of love of the world , not only we 'll see the entire gamorer of the human imagination . We 're not only going to see the entire gypes , but a day we 'll be able to be able to be a sleeping day from a slead to define ,
And it 's ulilightly to remember that our species is 600,000 years .
The Neolitic Rivolution , who gave us agriculture , which has done us to fight the cult of the champ of the sm of the smoke of the smoke of the slack of specialization , and we talk about 10,000 years ago .
The modern industrialized world has been 300 years .
The squallida story , I 'm not suggests that we have the risk to all the challenge that we 're going to deal with .
When these myriades of cultures of the world is asked what to say to be human , they resident with 10,000 different voices .
And it 's in these rispoints that we all all have the chance to be what we 're , a conscious species , that has to make all the people and all the given people and all the given people and all the gives can fiorn .
I 've been taken this picture on the northern extremity of Baffin , when I went to the whales with the Inuit , and this man , Olaya , and this man , Olaya , and this man , Olaya , and this man , Olaya , and that man , and this man , Olaya , and this man , Olaya , and this man , Olaya , and this man , and the man , and this man , and I went to the wanded of the way with the Inuit ,
The South government is not always gentle with the Inuit 's popular . And in the ' 50s to stbilish our supremise supremise our supremies , we have to them in colonies .
The grandfather of this man refuted to go .
The family , teming for his life , he took them all the retended out of the tiny .
You have to know that Inuit doesn 't temon the cold , they disdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisteming .
The pattins of slitte in the origin of the sleep sleep in the pin pain .
The grandfather of this man didn 't have to be intimight or from the library of the library , or from the library .
It 's sgattaiolded , you 've been cated the pantage of foca defecated in their hand . When you did it fleap , they 're working on a leama .
He 's sprred on the dog of this hell , and when it became solid , he killed a dog .
He has been a sleep with a brillilighter , with the cass of a sleep , has imbrillied another dog , and it 's disappeared on the banks , coltelescaccess in the remain .
We want to talk about cavarself-wild with nothing ?
Nella aprimed , 1999 , the Solitness of the Inuit 's total control of an area of a larger territory of the California and Texas I was together .
It 's the new pathria . It 's called Nunavut .
It 's an independent territory . They 're going to all the minerarial resources .
One splendied example of how a nation-state can recognize with his popular .
And , to finish , I think it 's pretty obvious at least who 's been in these remote song of the planet , to make it not really remote .
For someone is home .
They represent sexiety of human imagination that are rising to the dress of the time . And for all of these children , like dreams , they become part of our children , become part of the hope .
From , we 're in National Geographic , we 're convinced that the politicians will never come to nothing .
We believe the polemic --
[ Applausi is not persuasive , but we believe that the stories can change the world , and maybe we 're the better institution to tell the stories of the world . Every month of our website to get 35 million visits .
156 countries transmit our television canal .
Our rivivivivists are thrown from millions of people .
Our work is traveling in the ethnosphere to bring our audience in the cultural places that they 're going to be able to be able to , and you hope , abbraced , abbraced by how they saw and , they will be able to find a life in the diversity , and we have to find a style world of life in the diversity , and we have to find a multicultural world and multicultural world 's life in a pluralist and the world in the world of life in the diversity of life
where the wisdom wisdom of all the people can contribute to our collettive well-being collective .
Thank you .
I 'm going to talk about some of the things that I wrote in this book that I hope to be called the other that I 'm going to try to give you some of the college .
I 'd like to start with what I call " the official doggma official .
The official dogma ?
The official dogma official dogen western society . The official dogma official . " If we want to massive the well-being of our citizens , " The way to do it is massive individual liberty . "
The reason is , from one side , in fact that liberty is in itself a value , is pretious , is useful , essential for human beings .
The other is in fact that if we 're free , each of us can act for the right to do that that massive to do all of the way to do this massive being , no one that we 're not going to be that .
The way to massive freedom is massive to massive choice .
The more choices are more libits , and more are free , and more more , the more than their well-being .
This , I think , it 's so deeply roadicated in the society that nobody would be able to put it into doubt .
And it 's also deeply roadicated in our lives .
I 'm going to show you some examples of what progress has made possible .
This is my supermarket . It 's not particularly big .
I 'm just just a simple note about the injury .
In my supermarket , there are 175 conditions , without content 10 variety of the extract of the extract of the checksamic olive , that you can buy to give you a huge number of conditions in the increscent of your own degrees .
Here 's what the super-market .
Then you go to the store of electronic wrote to buy a stereo : CD , radio , radio , radio , radio , pluumped .
And in this single store of electronic components , there 's a big bunch number of audio components .
We can make six million and a half of different combinations , using the components that there are in one store .
You have to admit that there 's a lot of choice .
Other fields : the communications of communications .
Once , when I was a child , you could get all the telephotos , to pat all of the telephone 's fornites .
He was going to get the phone , you didn 't buy it .
A consequence of that , between the other , was that the telephones didn 't break .
This time , they 're going .
Now , we have a variety of telephones , especially between cell phones .
Here 's the cell phones of the future .
My favorite is the middle , lettor MP3 , cut out of the nose , and forforced to the cut me to the cut me .
If you don 't have the store under the store under the house , you 're going to be able to come .
And what happens is that people enter in the stices and does this question . And you know , what 's the answer is ? The answer is " No . "
It 's not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn 't make it .
So , in other aspects of life that are much more important than the acquired , the same same expensive choices .
Assistence , no longer in the United States that you go from the doctor and the dying you have to do .
Instead , you go from the doctor , and the doctor says , " OK , we could do , or B , " Well , " Ages this benefits and these risks . " Well , " it 's what do you want to do ? "
You say , " Doctor , what should I do ? "
And the doctor says , " A has these benefits and these risks , B has these benefits and those lawwers . "
" What do you want to do ? "
And you 're like , " Doctor if she was me , what would you do ? "
And the doctor , " But I 'm not . "
The result of the result of the maled authonomy of maled , expression that makes it look like a beautiful thing .
But it 's not that one of the weight and responsibility to make someone who knows something , which is the doctor , to someone else that doesn 't know -- and so much of it 's maled -- and so , you don 't have any of it 's wrong -- and so not in the ideal condition to decisions .
There 's a huge marketing of products , drug people like me and you , that if you think you 're not a sense , because you think you can 't buy them .
But if we can 't buy them , because they have public them ?
The answer is that they want to domness that we call the doctor to ask them to be to recipe .
Something that we 're fundamental as our identity is an indeed to choice , as you see in this jap . " We 're not going to force children . " We 're not going to force the most an identity : we need to invent .
And we can reinvent , how many times we have to do it .
That means that every morning , you have to decide that kind of person want to be .
It was a time to the family and marriage , a time the common perspective , unhappy , because anyone , it was that there was a married to be the most soon possible , and it started to make the more price .
The only green-choice was with who , not when , and even even what to do after .
Over day , it 's really to play .
I 'm very smart students , and I do their 20 percent of respect to a time .
And it 's not because they 're less diligent , not because they 're less diligent .
But why am I impensiered , intent to ask , " Would you marries me or not ?
" Do you have to marriried me later ? "
They 're interrogative interrogative .
And they try to answer these questions , even though this implessly , not to do the tune and not getting a beautiful vote to my exam .
And they have to do that . They 're important questions .
Now , the work : we 're lucky , like Carl soced , because the technology allows us to work every single time , from every day , from every corner of the planet , transn-one corner of the Hotel Randolph .
I 'm talking about , there 's a corner , and I 'm not going to tell anybody , where the WiFi works .
Not I say , because I want to use I want to use it .
What does this mean , this incredible freedom of choice that we have to work ? It 's that we have to continue , if we have to work or not .
We can go to see our son playing cell calcipes , with the cell phones in a rk , the Blackberry in the other , and the notebook , typically , on the gycles .
And even though I 'm all spent , every minute that we see our son 's children , we 're also asking the game , " I have to answer this called ? "
" Do you answer this email ? I have to get this letter ? "
And even when the answer is " no , " all this makes the experience of your son 's game of your son 's fun to be in other conditions .
So , from any part of the look at all , things and large materials , and life is a question of choices .
Once the world was this : Ovreal , there were some chance , but it was a choice of choice .
The world of today looks like this : The dilemma is , " Is it it , " Is it it . "
The answer is Same : The answer is Same .
We 're known to be , so I 'm going to talk about negative ones .
All this choice compories of two of the people .
The first , paradoxtionally , it 's that it makes you liberation instead of liberation .
With many options between which choose to choose , becomes very hard to do that .
I offer an an example : a conduct with a conduct plans of volunteer .
A my colleague has had access to the data of the Vand , the gigantic society of a depension of a million clients .
What she found is that for every 10 solutions that are offered in more , the percentage of adesion , the percentage of two percent .
With 50 sour-offerals , there 's 10 percent in less adhesions than when they 're available to when they 're available . Why ?
Because with 50 sour-four-four-four-year-old phards , and choice is remainly difficult to decide .
And I 'm going to tomorrow , and I wonder , tomorrow , and of course , I 'm never coming .
You can 't just mean that this doesn 't mean that these people will be food for dogs because they don 't have enough money , because they don 't want to say that the decision is so host that allow the funds of the dator of work .
Not participating , they 're losing until 5 to five to the year from work , that would be a worldwide .
So , the paralizes is a consequence of having too many choices .
And I think it makes the world like this .
" And to finish , for etheternity : ketchup , send or maion ? "
You would just take the right decision , if it 's for ethernity , right ?
You don 't want to choose the wrong wrong , and you know the wrong condition .
So this is the first effect . The second is that we can evote to avoid paralibe and do a choice , at the end , we 're less result of the result of how we would have been with less options between which choose .
And this for different reasons .
One of these is that with many conditions of which choose to choice , if you buy one and it 's not perfect , it 's easy to imagine that you could have been better . And that 's that 's that the alternative choice , and that 's that 's that the alternative imaginated with the sodatisfaces of choice , and the replaced replaced by the decision of the sodatisssatifying the soddisfying the soddisfresh of the sodatisfaces that you would have been better .
And even when it was a very good decision .
The more choices are , more easy to displeasant than any detail that 's insodatisfacts of the option of choice .
And there 's what economists call expensive expensive .
Dan Gilbert has close very well stamattina as the value of things that we 're going to depends on what we 're confronted with .
The rest , when there are many options , it 's very easy to represent the characternative of the alternative dott-waste and be less subatisatisfacts of the option that you 're choice .
Here 's an example . I 've been schools with all the ones that are not New York .
But that 's what you would probably think .
There 's this copy in Hamptons .
A lussian place place .
Spiach splendida . Otly day . It 's all about them .
Not any thing . But what he thinks is , " Well , malction , it 's Agottle . "
" All my neighbors in Manhattan is . "
" I could talk about it right in front of home . "
And it 's going to go out of the idea that 's losing -- every day -- every day -- the chance to parking where you want .
The expensive opportunity diminuried the subsisidies that we have , as a choice was excellent .
And the options that we have to look at , the more the characteristics will rererererereturn to the expensive opportunity .
Here 's another example .
This is a lot of things .
It 's about living the time , and maybe living slowly .
But the most important point is that you choose , you 're going to be able to do other .
The things that we don 't choose to be active active , that can make less attractive what we do .
Third point : spiral growing of expectations .
I tried it on my skin buying a new jeans .
I 'm almost always jeans .
Once the jeans were just like a bought , and they were comoked and they were discovered , just after they were laid them a lot of times , they started to go well .
So I went to buy a couple of time when the old people were going , and I said , " I 'm going to have a jeans , this is my cut . "
The commit was telling me , " Look , what 's like , fit , rely fit ? "
And you want to do with the cerniera ? " Stonehed " Stonehed " or " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " Hiidjuhed " Hed . "
" Look want ? "
" Do you want to get them to go out ? Bil bla bla -- " Continured to elenjoy .
I was sleep , and after a little bit , and after a little bit , " I want the one of the only guy , " I want to be , " I want to have to be , so I tried to all jeans , and then I 'm out of the jeans , and I 'm going to use of the best jeans that I 've ever had .
It was the massive . With all that I had the best one .
But I felt I was worse .
Why ? I 've written a whole book to understand that .
The reason I was worse that I was worse is that with all the choice were very high , jeans had to be perfect .
I was expected to me . I didn 't expected to wait about excited about that when there was just a guy , but when it was 100 different , accidents , at least one guy had to be perfect .
What I had been buy , but not perfect .
After I had a choice with the choice with what I was trying to be insatisfaced in confronted to expectations .
The added of options in the life is not to increase the expectations that these have respect to the ecture of the options of the same .
And this will be less subdisfaction , even when the result of the result of the result .
Nobody in the marketing world , you realize .
Because if they knew that , you 're not awful about what I 'm talking about .
The truth looks more than that .
" You were better when it was worse , " The reason that was better when it was worse was worse , it was still possible to meet of surprised pleasant surprised pleasant surpries .
Over the world we live in -- opulent , industrialized industrialized facts with the expectancy of performance -- the massive massive that we can hope is that things are at the altel of expectations .
You 're never surprised pleased because your expectations , my expectations , they 're unlight-up .
The secret of happiness -- what you 're here -- is , " Baswaiting . "
I mean , little biographic moment -- that I 'm really married and my wife is really amazing .
I couldn 't do any better , I didn 't have any content .
But it 's not always a bad thing .
And finally , a consequence of buying a couple of jeans , and then you 're just that jeans is that when you 're not satisfaced , and you 're asking , " Why ? "
" Who is responsible ? " , the answer is clear .
The world is responsible . What can I do you ?
When there are hundreds of kinds of jeans , and buy one one bought a insody-insodly , and ask you who are responsible , it 's closly to the responsible is you .
You could have to do better .
With hundreds of variety available , there are no scuse for insuccess .
So when people take decisions , even though the result is valive , they feel insoddisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisappeared .
In the last few years , the depression is exploded in the industrialized world .
I think a meant factor -- not the only one , but important , of this honent wave of the depression is that people have to be too high .
And when they have to explain this situation that the colse is they think they 're going to be .
So the final result is that we 're better , objectively , but we feel worse .
Let me remember you .
This is the official dogma , what we all take for good and it 's completely fleap . It 's not true .
There 's no doubt that a little bit of choice is better than I don 't have to do it , but from this doesn 't be a little better than a little better than a little bit .
There 's a criticiicist , magic . I don 't know what it 's .
But I 'm sure we 've been supposed to be a piece of the level in which choices are going to improve our life .
Now , from political point of view -- I 'm almost finished -- from political point of view , the nocccracy is the following .
What allows you all this choice in the industrial society is the material wealth .
There are many places in the world , and you know , where the problem is not that they have any choice .
The problem is that they have too few .
So the factory that I 'm talking about is a malbeing exclusive sent of modern , remarkable society .
And what makes you have to deprimor and climbs is this : Steve Levitt talked about how much those expensive and discoveries of the babs are inuseful .
I mean these choices , complicated and available , it 's not that they 're useful .
They 're dollar dollar .
They make them worse .
If a little bit of what our society in our society allows , and it was reversed in those where people have too much a few chance , it would not just their life to improve but our life .
This is what economists call a paretian improving improvement .
A redistribution of income re-income re-greenly -- not only to the poor -- because of this choice in excess that we go back .
To conclude , " You can be all of that you want to be , "
You , people , you 'll think , " But what 's crede that fish ? "
" It 's obvious that you can 't get anything in a glass box . "
" A castrated , a limited view of a world -- "
and I 'm going to be interpreted so , at the beginning .
But then , I think , instead , I realized that that that the fish knows the long way .
Because the reality of the facts is that if you 're missing the box , so that , " you can 't get the freedom . "
If you break the box in a way that all of divent diving the soddisfaction .
You 'll be the paralist , and you 'll reduced the well-being .
Everybody needs a sphere .
This is almost certainly too much , maybe even in the fish , and it 's sure for us .
But the absolutely symbolic symbolic symbolic and , for the sudden .
Thank you of heart .
