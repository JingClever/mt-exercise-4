I showed these these slides of the slide of the slide of the painting calculus , which for almost three million years had the size of 48 million years had the size of the 48 of the United States continental , it 's remarkable to 40 percent .
However this submb is the gravity of the problem because it doesn 't show the spent of the ice .
The arctic calculus is , in a sense , the heart of the global climate system .
You go to the winds and you get ritizens .
The next slide will be a fast carrelated to the advent of the last 25 years .
The ice ice ice ice are signed in red .
As you see , you go to the wall .
That 's the ice in the invernice , which is ritizens .
You can see that the cosidgen , of five years or more , is like blood , which is like blood , which is like blood , which is like blood .
In 25 years , it 's past that , in the way .
This is a problem because the resting scale of the prayon the ground , the ice ice ice ice , where there are enormous amounts of coal , where they have the main of the microbes .
I think about the totality of the inatmospherical instrument , that amount of global warming could doubt , super-scale , super-scale .
In some laghi , a little deep in Alaska metane , is already rebolling out of the water .
The professor Katey Walter of the University of Alaska , I was recall with a team of a blow slow last last time .
Video : Wow ! Al Gore : You 're good . The question is if we 're also going to be we also .
And this is that this exchange change change the Groenland from the northermal .
This is a coume to be a coume of the glacial ,
The door had never reached to the livels .
This is the Kangerlussuaq , in the west of Groenland .
If you want to know how the sea level of the sea , the sea level of the ice ice of the raferm to the sea .
These corrupting are very quickly .
The other part of the planet : Antartide , the largest block of ice on the planet .
The month of the scientists have dichied that the paintings of ice is in negative , and that Antarctde Western , who pogers on some sun izy issue , is particularly quickly , it 's particularly quickly to the sun .
Equival to six feet of the aceast , like in Groenland .
The Himalaya , the third largest , the third largest block , who were ice ice , they were ice ice .
40 percent of the world population will get half of the world population will get out of the water from that leaving .
Sulle Ande : this glaciis the source of the water is the fount of the water .
The landed is increased .
But when it comes out , the same happens to the water water .
In California , the nenow on the Sierra Nevada is diminured of 40 percent .
The rans are in crisis .
The predictions , like you read , you are good .
The growth of secustoming in the world door to a remarkable .
The environmental disasters are increasing a rim outside of the normal and without precedented .
Four times more numeroes in the last 30 years , respect of 75 .
This is a whole insustainable .
If you look at the historical consciences if you can see the consequences .
In the last five years we added 70 million tons of CO2 , every 24 hours -- 25 million tons in the ocean every day .
Look at the time of the oriental Pacific , the American area , to the west , and in both the substant parts of the Indian of the indeed of the inner of the ocean oxygen in the ocean .
The major of global warming , together to the deforestation , which is 20 percent , is the use of fossil comics .
The oil is a problem , and the coal is even worse .
The United States is one of the two countries with the most emissions , together to China .
And he propond to build a lot of other central coal .
But we 're seeing a way of the direction .
These are the anullated projects in the last few years and some of the green proof .
So , there 's a political load in our country .
The carbon industry and oil have spent 250 million dollars in the last year to promote carbon , which is a bunch of the pulit , which is a bycle of the coal .
And I remember something that picture me remembered me to something --
Natas in the Tennessee , where I live , there was a 3.8 billion lifeters of the soon of the soon of coal .
Maybe you 've seen the news .
This is the second largest flow in America .
It 's happened around Natal .
The adverage of one of the coal industry was this .
Video : Swear ] Frosty cooooid is a kind of allegro and happy .
It 's abundying here in America , and it 's grow our economy .
Frosty coooid is always more clean .
It 's good price , adorable and the maintain stypend .
Al Gore : From here is a lot of the coal of the West Virginia .
The biggest minerair society on the mountain Coal . This is his administrator .
Video : Don Blankenship : I 'll be clear -- Al Gore , Nancy Pelokenship , Harry Reid -- they don 't know what they 're talking about .
Al Gore : So Alleance for the Protext of Clima has launched two campaign .
This is a one of them , a part .
Video : Actor : ALergy : ALergy , as a sea sea minactor to our business .
So , for this priority is to invest a huge amount of money in a bunch of money in a forforce and confused the truth of the coal .
In fact , coal is not sporite .
We think it 's clean -- it 's also a good profum .
So , not preopcues of climate change .
Let me do it to us .
Video : Acore : Carbone , you 've heard a lot of talk about .
So we do a little bit of a structure to the avaning structure of the pulit of the pulit .
Straordinary ! The machines are a little rumorous , but this is the sound of the pulit technology .
The consumption of the main cause of global warming , but the remarkable technology of global warming , but the remarkable technology of the pulit that you see changes everything .
You look at a look at : this is the odiergn technology .
Al Gore : Infinally , the positive positive , the positive of the economic security and the national security .
Video : Comment : The America is in crime ; the economy , the national security , the climate crisis .
The file connects all : our dependence from fossil combustible combustible , like coal coal and oil .
Now , there 's a new new , audace solution to use it .
Repower : 100 percent of chair , in 10 years .
A plan to reput America to work , make sure more sure , and help us make the global warming .
So , a solution that bastes to solve our problems .
Repower . Scoprite more .
Al Gore : This is the last .
Video : Comment of require to America .
One of the fastest ways of the dependence of dependence to dependence from the commodly fast , that 's the faster of the commodly fast ,
Comparsa : The future is here . Vent , a new new network .
Comparsa two : Novi investment for the worth of work ,
Anyment : Repower . It 's time to be realists .
Al Gore : A old proverbio says , " If you want to go fast , you go to fast , you go to fast .
If you want to go away , you go together . "
We have to go away , so quickly .
Thank you very much .
Last year at TED , I did a introduction on the LHC .
And promise to return to travel you about how the machine works .
So here I 'm going to do . And for those who had no , the LHC is the biggest scientific experiment ever tented -- 27 miles of a cirmit .
His companies of rererereturn the conditions that were presents less than a billion than a billion times from the beginning of the universe -- until 600 million million times the second .
All of this is just environmentous .
This is the machine under Ginevra .
We 're doing this little little bit of the Big Bang in the remarkable .
This is what it 's working . This is called the ATLAS -- is 44 feet and he has a diameter of 22 feet .
This is a picture of ATLAS in building so you can see the proportions so you can see the proportions .
To 10 settember of the last year we have acceso the machine for the first time .
And this picture was taken from ATLAS .
It was because of immenis festeggies in the saves of control .
It 's a picture of the first fascion the LHC , and he had done all the the LHC , both in the LC , and in the LC , and spread particles inside the rull .
In other words , when we see that image 10 settember , we realize that the machine worked , which is a great witten .
I don 't know if it was this to make us more or this , when someone went to Google and saw that the page was this .
That means we had a cultural impact beyond beyond to the scientific impact .
About a week after , there was a problem with the machine , I had to do this here -- these file brought here -- these file bles here -- these sleeps .
These file file 13,000 amps when the machine works at the massive of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the massive .
Now , the technique between you will look at the file and say , " It 's not true . I 'm sorry too sotle . "
And instead can do it because when they 're very cool cool cool .
So , at least 271 degrees , at a temperature , in the space between the stars , these files can bring that run that corrupt .
In one of the giuntures between the most novehicle in the LHC , there was a defect of the fabric .
So the file file , they surround slightly , and the 13,000 pounds improvised a electrical resistance .
This was the result .
Now , this is more impressive if you think about the fish that these magnetic fish , if you think that these fairs more than 20 tons , and they moved about 30 centimeters .
They 're drugs about 50 magneti .
We had to ball , what we did .
We restinated and traveled .
They 're now now now getting all of their own place .
By the end of the LHC is going to be again integrated .
We 'll access to the right , and we 're wait to get to the right data , and continue so our adventure to find out what the morning is the morning that are the morning that universe .
Now , of course , in a certain way , these accidents return the dibate on the value of science and engineering in front of science and engineering in front of science and engineering in front of the conviction .
I think the fact that it 's so hard , the fact of going to be so hard to be the value of things like LHC .
I would like to conclude with the words of a English scientists , Humphrey Davy , which , I suppose in difense of the inuseful experiments of his pupile , his clean , his clean , his clean , he said , " Nijump is very dangerous for the progress of science is the degrees of the science that don 't have a new worlds of our own own own , and that don 't have been a whole worlds . "
Thank you .
I want to start asking you to start thinking about when , you know , you know , you 're playing the morning honto .
And as you understand how to reach them and make them , take them and get them , you know , you know , you know , you know , we actually think and solve problems and construction .
The space reasoning is deeply connected to the way we understand the way we understand the grandchildren of the world around us .
So , from information to inspired from the use of our physical objects , together to my physical consultant , and my collaborator Jeevan Kalanii , I started to ask , " And if we use a computer , when we use a computer , instead of having the cursor of the mouse as the pollyer , we could actually make a sweet , we could actually make a sweet with both hands , you could be the hands , with both the hands ,
and how do you do it to our please ?
The question was so interesting that we decided to explore the answer , building Siftable .
In a few words , a Siftable computer is a big computer interactive , like a biscopic .
In a few words , a Siftable computer is a big computer interactive , like a biscopic .
You can move to the hand , you can see , " between them , you can see their movement and they have a screen and a radio and a radio wireless .
But in fact , they 're physicians , like the mors , you can move to just affiry .
The Siftable is an example of a new ecosystem to manipulate digital information .
And as they become more physical , conscious , you know about the movement , of the other , and as they become more physical , conscious , of how we go them , we can explore new and different style and different style of interaction .
I 'll start with some simple example .
This Siftable is configurate to show video : if you put it in a direction , video will be so if you 're in a direction , if you 're in the other side of the back .
These interactive rats are awful about other .
If you deaffize them , they 're interested in what they 're around .
If you get the circummmall , they can do it a little bit .
If you get the circummmall , they can do it a little bit .
They also have their movement and inclination .
We realized that one of the most implications of the interaction was able to use the common on data , to example , " a color like , " a color like it was a liquid .
In this case , we have three Siftable configurate as bone and I can use them to be able to be able to use them to the color , where they missed .
and I can use them to be a current of color in the central , where they misses .
If you 're too much , we can put a little bit of place .
There are also beautiful chance of apprentice , like language , mathematics and logical games where people can try things to try to do things very quickly , and see the immediately immediately immediately .
Now , I 'm --
This is a Fibonaccount that I do do with a program of equations .
Here we have a game of words that 's in the half of the words that 's in the Scarabeo and Boble .
Pratically , at every turn-rich turnal turnal , in the Siftable , Pratically , you get a letter to the sletter to the sletter , and while you 're trying to get a letter to a deal .
And then , after about 30 seconds , they remissed , and you have a new set of reading and new chance to try .
Thank you .
Here 's the children came to the Media Lab , I did this so that I tried them and I did a video .
They have very liked .
And one of the things that are interestingly in this application is that you don 't have to give you a lot of education .
You just say , " Compons of words , " and they know exactly what do .
Here 's how to other people who try .
This is our young engineer tester , there on the right .
It was really wanted to impilling them .
They only are morongs , for him .
Now , this is a appliliance of a paper .
We wanted to build a tool for the Lui of language . He 's Felix .
It can put new characters in the scene , and you can get the Siftable .
It can put new characters in the scene , and you can get the Siftable .
So , that 's doing the sun .
Video : The sun is source .
David Merrill : Now she took a treat a herrill .
Video : The treat treat .
Bel work ! Yeah !
So either up the Siftable and put closer can interact the characters --
Video : Bau !
-- by inventing your story .
Video : Hoo !
DM : It 's a story with the open open , and it can decide him how you do it .
DM : It 's a story with the open open , and it can decide him how you do it .
Video : Very , gat .
DM : The last example I have time to show you is a tool , I 've got a tool tool , to sample and execececectured music .
It 's a tool , I made of recent , to sample and to do music .
The Siftable here to be the basis , the basis and bacteria .
Each one of these has four different variations , and you can choose what to use .
You can also put these sounds in a sequence of to you to get your pleasure .
And it just to do touch a sound and a sequence . "
These are actually , you can control from the vive , like the reverbero and the filter .
The attacks to a particular sound and then inclens to enjoy it .
And then there are the general effective as time and fly , who are going to be playing to the whole sequence .
Let 's look at how it works .
Video : We 'll start a base in two Siftable sequence , we 'll put a series , we put in a series , we add to the other base .
Now I put a line line of the basis .
Video : DM : Now I add of percussions --
Video : DM : And I 'll put the filter to the bacteria , so I can control the effect from the vision .
Video : DM : I can get the whole sequence on the intersequence of the fall the time on the other side , or another .
Video : DM : And I 'm going to add the filter to give more expression .
Video : DM : I can recombine the sequence . "
So I don 't have to be planning before , but I can improvisit , and make it more corner or the corner .
And now , finally , I can spend the whole sequence of the left the Siftable to the left Siftable .
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is to build new new interfaces that will always work to work our brain and body .
And today , I had time to show you one of the results of this path , and also some chance we try to bring out of the lab .
The concept I want to move to is that 's coming up to this new generation of designed to interact with digital media , which will bring information in our world that we want .
Thank you very much .
I don 't see the time to talk to you with all of you .
I 'm a writer .
I think about books is my profession , but it 's more than this , of course .
It 's also love and the fashion and the fashion of my life .
And I don 't look like to change .
But , said , this is something particular happened in my life and in my career , which has taken me to recently the whole whole thing with this work .
The particular thing is I recently written this book , this biography called " Mangia , Prega , Ama , " What , diversly from my books , for some reason I was used to go out in the world and he became a great feelings , bestler , best-extremely , willing , wild extraordinary .
And the result is that everywhere to go now , people treatments treatments treatments .
You know , you know , you know , you know , you know ,
They 're going to be all about me and they say , " Do you don 't have fear to do it better ?
Do you don 't care about writing for all life without able to create a book that could be able to make a book that could be able to be able to make a book that could be able to be able to make a book that could be able to be able to make a book that could be able to be able to be able to make a book that could be able to be able to create a book that could be able to be able to create a book that could be able book ? "
that can be important to someone ? "
It 's rursusured , you know .
But it could go worse , at the time I remember that more than 20 years ago , when I started to say to people -- I was a writer -- I wanted to be a writer .
I would put up to the same reaction .
And people said , " Don 't you caught me to do it ?
Do you don 't care about the umillion refuse killed you ?
Do you don 't care about the whole life without anything about anything about anything about the life without anything about it it comes and death and death of a coat the pile of the pile of the bunch of the bear , and you know , " the brought of failure ? "
So , you know .
The answer -- the brief answer to all of these questions is , " You . "
I 'm fear to all of those things .
I always had fear .
And I also fear to many other things that people can 't inguess .
As the algains and other things .
But , for how to write the thing I thought and I 'd ask me , and I would ask me the last multimate is why ?
Is it rational ?
It 's logical that anyone who has been wait to be spent to be spent from a work that you feel bored to do .
But what 's so particular in the impress , creative , and it 's about the health care of the forth of the health care of the other carrier , not doing ?
How my father , for example , he was a chemical engineer and not remember one time in his 40 years of activity in his 40 years of activity that was asked if he had fear to be engineer ?
There was never -- that blown to the engineer John , how does it go ?
It didn 't work so , you know ?
Onestly , the chemical engineers like group have no matter , in the search , in the search , reputation to be alcolized maniaces .
We have a writers , we have enough this reputation , and not just writer , but creativity of every kind , we have this reputation of being enormous instaable to be enormous .
And it 's not to look at the triad of the dead of the magnifments of the magnifments of the magnifments of the green century , they die young people and often .
And the ones that don 't have to be really disfaced from their dunds .
Norman Mailer , before he said , " in the last interview , " Every my book , he killed me a little more " extraordinary affermation about the work of their life .
But we don 't buy the way we feel that because we 've heard these things so long that in some way we 're all all the way we 're all all the way we have been interior and suffering are in some way , and the art , at the end , the end , the end will always conversation and the art , to be always going to be a analysis .
And the question I want to take all of the today is : you 're agree with this idea ?
You know this thing -- because it also looks like a centimeter of a distance of the distance of the distance of the distance of the distance of the distance of the distance of the distance of the distance of a hundred of the distance of the distance of the distance of the distance of the distance of the distance .
I think it 's odious .
And I think it 's also dangerous and I don 't want to see the perpetuated in the next century .
I think it 's better encouraging our big minminds to live .
And I certainly know that , in my case -- in my situation -- it would be very dangerous to start that feel really good about suppointed to the surrounding of the surrounds that they are in my career .
Of course -- you look at , they 're quite young , I 'm quite young , I 'm quite young , I 'm quite young , I 'm quite young ,
I still have about four decades of work in me .
And it 's very likely that everything I 'll write about now is going to be judge from the world like the work that I used to do it as a very success of my last book .
I 'm going to be slavery , because we 're all more or less friends here -- it 's likely to my big success is to my spent .
Oh , Gesus , who thought !
You know , this is the kind of thinking that leads a person to start to bat at the nine of the morning and I don 't want to do it .
I would continue to keep doing this work that we do .
So , the question becomes , how ?
And so I think , after a lot of reflections , that the way to work to continue to write is to create a psychologic constructed psychologic , OK ?
I had some way to find a distance of security between me , which I 'm writing , and my natural anxist that writing the writing of the time , I was trying to get this last year models to see if you start looking through the time , trying to find other society to see if they could have better ideas and more than they could have better ideas and more than they feel like to see if they could have to have the best ideas and sane to see if they have to have to have the best ideas ideas of the best ideas and the same time ,
to help people believe that creative to make the inerent people to make the inerent emotivity .
And that research has taken me to the Greek and ancient Rome .
Seguitems because I 'm giving me in the circle and then back .
In the ancient Greek and ancient Rome -- the people didn 't seem to believe that creativity came from men , OK ?
And it was thinking that creativity was this spirit look at the men and the people who were in the men from some source and unknown , for the distant distant , and unknown , for the distant and unknown .
The green were called these these spirites were the waterves of creativity .
Socrate , wonderful , he believed to have a demon that held the wisdom from the far away from the far .
The Roands were of the idea , but they call that the kind of spirit , and they were a genius .
which is great , because the Roands didn 't really think that a genius was somebody who was particularly smart .
They believe that a genius was this kind of entity divine that was living in the murders of a artist , a little like the A..m. , a little like the elfo Dobby , and that came up to the work of the artist work and models the result of the artist work and models the result of that work .
Exccitional -- here is the distance of which I 'm talking about -- that 's the distance of your work .
And everyone knew that was so that it worked , right ?
So the antiks were protected to certain things , like , like , for example , the way of the too narcisive artists were protected to be a lot of things , like , right ?
If your work was exceptional , you couldn 't get the deserve , you know that the deserve , you know that the waste .
If your failure work , it wasn 't all your whole , right ?
Everybody knew that was your genius to be a inable .
And so people han inepipttask creativity in Occcient for a long time .
And then the Rinascivent came and everything changed , and it was a lot of the human idea ; we put the human being in the middle of the universe over the universe on the middle of the universe over the universe on the divet-de-up , and no more leaving space to the divinity .
This was the principle of humans and rational people started thinking about crecreative creative came from the hydgen .
And for the first time in the story , you start to referred to this or artist as a kind of genius to this , or a person with genius ,
And I have to say , I think that was a big mistake .
I think that allow someone , a simple person to believe that they 're like a recipient , the essence and the source of all the mysteries of all the misters , creativity , and inknowable and eeternical is a very big physical responsibility to be too big to give to the human fragile .
It 's like to ask someone to enjoy the sun .
And then , it 's wrong and destores all these inexist airplants on the performance .
And I think it was this pressure to have been destroyed the artists in the past 500 years .
And if this is true , and I think that is , the question is , and now ?
Can we do that ?
Maybe I 'll come back to a more ancient understanding of the relationship between humans and mistery creative .
Or maybe not .
Maybe we can 't cell 500 years of rational thinking in a speech of 18 minutes .
And there 's probably people in the audience that would be reading the scientific sospjects on the notion of , you know , you know , you know that people spend the next people in the deal with their projects .
I 'll tell you all know about this thing .
But the question I 'd like to ask is -- why no ?
Why don 't I think about this way ?
Because it has more sense of everything that ever heard to explain the exaspersual imprevedibility of creative process .
So , one process that , as anybody who ever tried to do something -- so , basically , all of this -- you don 't know , you know , you 're not understanding .
And , in fact , it can sometimes seem completely paranormous .
I did this inagainst recently in the extraordinary Ruth Stone , who has 90 years , but he was a poetry for all life and said that during his infants in the camps , and he was working out in the camps , and he felt in the camps , and he fellow , when a pointed from the landscape .
He said that was like a frageous tracy of the air .
And he came up to her from the landscape .
You feel that , because he was to try to get the land under his feet .
He knew that I had one thing to do to do that point and was of , and she was , he walk like a main . "
And so he goes to home and he was slow from this poetry , and it would not have to get any other piece of paper and a math enough , and a math enough , while the traps , and he would recoke the page .
Sometimes I couldn 't be enough to be fast enough , so he would go and correcreceive and correcreceived in home and she had to go into the house and she had to keep through and she would continue to reach through the landscape , trying to reach through the landscape , trying to say , " another poet . "
And then there were those times -- this piece of not forget to -- there were some of the moments that was almost losing , OK ?
So , he was running home and he was trying to the card and the poetry went through , and he was a mitted right in the time , and then he said , that was like if you walk up with the other hand and the steffee .
And he had the poetime from the coda and reput in his body and the spend of the page .
And in these cases , the poetry would be presented on the perfect , and the last word to the last word .
So when I heard about -- it 's pathesco , it 's exactly the same same .
Not all the process -- I 'm not a convicted .
I 'm a mule , and my way to work is ; you know , you know , I 'm going to see the same orary horarian , and I 'll go up up on the office .
But even me , in my waggin , I 've been stripped to that thing , sometimes .
And I guess that even many of you the han .
You know , even though the work and ideas came to me from a certain source , you can 't know about honestly , you can 't know about hold .
And what is this thing ?
And how do we relate to it in a way to do not to make us your head , but rather , rather , that makes us remain in healthy ?
For me , the best example , the best example , I 'm the best example I have the musician Tom Waits , which I interviews different years ago for a day .
We were talking about this , and you know , Tom , for the majority of life was the incarnation of the artist of the clock of the artist , trying to control , dominate these species of impults .
But then I 'll invecent , I 'll cut , and one day , while he was driving on a road in L.E. , changed everything for him .
He was going to be fast and everything from a tract , this little framework with melodia , which comes in his head as it makes the inspiration , and the wild , and the wouldn 't know how to take it .
It 's not a piece of paper , it has no matter , it has no matter , it has no matter , it has no matter , it has no matter , it has no matter , it has no matter , it 's not a multiple .
So I started to feel this kind of old old , he 's grow up in him , " I 'm going to lose , and I 'm going to be obsessed by this sessed sessed by this song .
I don 't have enough and I can 't do it . "
And instead of going to go to the panic , you 're going to stop .
I 'll be the whole whole process and he did something completely new .
He just just just the sky and said , " Scause , you don 't see that I 'm driving ? "
" Where looks like that can write a song now ?
If you really want to be there , you 're going to be a more opporter , when I can take me care of you .
And you 're going to be able to impact qualcanother today .
You 're going to disturban Leonard Cohen . "
And his process changed after this .
Not the work , the work was still sure as a always knows .
But the process , and the fish anxiety that was attack was require when he press the genius , the genius of him out of him , and he was going to go back to where the problem was going back from where , and he would go back from where , and he was going to go back from where , and he would .
but you know , this is a little bit of a conversation between Tom and this strange , and the outside Tom and this strange and outside .
So how you feel that story about to change a little bit of the way I was working and I 'm already saving and I 'll save me a time .
This idea , I save me when I was writing " Mangia , Prega , Ama , and I 'm going to be a disperation that we 're all working on something and we don 't know and you start to think that will be a disaster , which is going to be a disaster , which is going to be the worst book I written .
Not just bad , right , right the worst book writing .
And I started to think about this project .
But then I remember about Tom who talked about the air and you tried .
So I went to my face on the sets and I recognize my face to a corner and I was made my command to the room .
And I said to the big voices , " Sys , what we 're going to be brilliant , if this book is not going to be brilliant coled , no ?
Because as I see I 'm putting everything I don 't have , I don 't have this .
So if you want to be better , you have to show you and do your side .
OK . But if you don 't do it , you know what , I don 't do it .
I 'm going to write the same because it 's my work .
And I 'd like to favor that was recorded that I was presented to do my part of the " because -- finally , OK -- it 's so , OK -- -- it was so , OK -- they were in the desert of the people were rounded for the likkk-up , dances and music to the alone .
And they were always magnify because the ballerins were great , and they were great .
But every so , rarely , something happened , and one of these artists became actually transcendent .
And I know what you know is talking about , because I know you 've all seen , a point , a performance so .
It was like if the time you stop , and the ballerd , and the ballerd walked through a kind of land-up , like 1,000 night , but everything was all of the time , but everything was all of it .
And suddenly , not appears to be just like a human .
But you access to the divinity down in the fire of the divinity .
And when this was going to be , the people knew what was , he was called him .
They were the hands and started to doctor , " Allah , " Allah , God , God , God , God , God , God , God , " God , God , " God , "
That 's God , you know .
Curious note -- when the More invads the soouth of Spain , pressure this abitude with them and the sounds changed in the Allah , Allah , Allah , " in " Ole , " the , the ran , the rich , you can still feel in the corride or the fall in the streams or .
In Spain , when a artist did something that 's impossible and magic , " Allah , " Allah , " By , " incompanies , I was a last -- a last -- a last -- a last -- a last thing .
And it 's great because we need .
But , the problem comes the day after , for the ballerin the same , when you go up and discover that are 11 of the morning of Martedesesday and the last of God .
It 's just a mortal with gran bad bad knife , and maybe it can 't be able to make that altitude .
And maybe nobody will you have the name of God , and what do you have to do with the rest of his life ?
It 's hard .
This is one of the most painful recognize to make in a creative life .
But maybe it doesn 't have to be so angoscious if you can 't believe , and you 're so annowed , that the most extraordinary expect of your being from yourself .
But you might just believe that you 're in the prestipy of an inimaginable source of your life that you have to go to someone else when you finished .
And , you know , if we think about this everything changes .
And so I started thinking about , and it 's sure that I thought about the several months during the book that I 'm going to be able to be doing , the dangerous , spent , attesissum , attesissum , attesissued , I 've been followed to think about the next thing .
And what I have to continue to me when I feel I feel I 'm going to go out from this is , not to do .
Not just just on your work .
You can put your own part of your part , any can be .
If your work is bally , ball .
If the divine , you know , you know , you know , if you 're assigned to leave some kind of wonderful , for one time through your forforce , then , " Ole ! "
You 're all , you do the same your dance .
And " Ole ! " You know , you know , you know , " You know , " Ole the same .
I think , and I think I should be teaching it .
" Ole ! " You know , even though , just for us human and testoaggin tals from the tali to make you continue .
Thank you .
Thank you .
June Cohen : Ole !
As I 've been talking about some of these projects about some of these projects on the human genome , what can meet and the discovery of genes .
Now we 're starting a new persual , we started to digitalize biology and now we 're going to go from that digital code we 're going to into a new phase of biology , design and synthesize life .
We always tried to ask for the big questions .
" What is life ? " is something that many biologists think I have been trying to figure out the livelihood of the livels .
We 've tried different approaches , reduced to the minimum .
We 're digitalize from almost 20 years .
When we sequenced the human genome was treated to go from the analogical world of biology to the digital world .
Now we ask us : can we regenerate life , or to create new life from this digital universe ?
This is the map of a little organism , Mycoplasma genitalium , which is the species from the smaller genome between the little bit of those who can authorior lab .
And we tried to reduce the genome to create more more little .
We can eliminate a hundred of genes of about 500 .
But when we look at the metabolic map , it 's relatively simple respect to our .
I believe me , this is simple .
But when we look at all the genes we can get to , one at the time , it 's very unimpround that this can bring a living cells .
So we decided that the only forth to progrede was synthesize this chromosoma in a way to be modify this chromosoma to bring some of these fundamental questions .
So , we started the adventure of " Can Can we could synthize a chromosoma ? "
Can you realize that chemistry to make these big molecules that we never have to create these big molecules that we never could do it before ?
And , in case , we can we make a chromosoma ?
A chemical chemical chemical material .
The speed we 're able to digitalize life is growing to the exponential life is growing to requential .
Our skills to write the genetic code , instead , progreded rather slowly , but it 's improving .
And our most recent results the results of the exponential .
We started more than 15 years ago .
The process of require many passages , starting with a bioetc revision before we start the first experiments .
But we found that synthesize of DNA is very hard .
There are tens of thousands of cars in the world that make little segments of DNA , the long , the long of 30 to 50 lectops and it 's a process of degenerative , the most mistakes are .
So we had to develop a new method to make these framments and correcrecreceive the mistakes .
And this was our first attempt , to particiate digital information of the genome of the Phi of the GDo Jumps of the 24 .
It 's a little virus that kills .
We designed the fragments , effectively the rules and get a molecule of DNA of about 5,000 lectans .
The interesting part is when we took this piece of chemical material , and we put it in bacteria , and we put it in bacteria , the bacteria have started reading this genetic code and property the viral particles .
The viral particles have then been released by the cell , they went back and they destroyed the Eccles .
I talked about recent a recent of the oil industry , and they 're certainly understanding this model .
They refer more than you .
We believe this is a situation where software can actually make its same hardware going to build his same hardware in a biological system .
But we wanted to do things to be in great .
We wanted to build the whole chromosoma .
They 're more than 580 miles the letters of genetic code .
So we thought of building it in cassets of the virus , so we can change the cassets that are the components of a living cells .
The design is crucial , and if we start with digital information in a computer , these have to be very accurate .
When we sequenced this genome for the first time in 1995 , the fall was of a mistake for 10 mile .
We found , resequency , 30 mistake . If we had that original sequence that we never had been able to do it work .
And one part of the process is designing to design segments that are very very very long to make a lot of other than 50 lectans to build underneath to build underneath .
We 're going to try to get the elements here .
You probably read that we 're going to be a lot of the filigrid of the fishing .
Think so : we have a genetic code on four letters : A , C , G and To .
Three of those letters together codifying about 20 admess , and there 's a specific order to read for every friend of the leck-in-lominominominods .
So we can use the genetic code to write words , fressesses , thinking .
What we did at the beginning is autographed .
Some of the fact that it wasn 't a poetime .
We designed these segments to just just just just a land-up .
There are some of them to refly and put them up .
And we started assemble with segments , starting with segments from five to seven miles , and they can make a segments of 24 miles in the way to make the segments to their time to get to 72 miles .
And we 've made these segments in abundance so that we 're trying to do this this is that we 're trying to create a very very extremely robustobestothers -- as you 'll see in a minute .
We 're trying to automatize the process .
So , this looks like the tabellone of the basket .
When we get to these very long segments , more than 100 miles , more than 100 miles , they don 't grow up to the Eccclocks .
You get to the modern instruments of modern biology .
So we 've been considered to other mechanisms .
We knew about another mechanism called recombination , which in biology , and in biology , and in biology , and it could be a DNA to repair segments .
Here 's an example .
This organism , called the Deinococcus radioococcus .
You can see in the sophister as his chromosoma is destroyed .
In 12 -- 24 hours is reput up exactly like it was before .
They 're thousands of organisms that they 're able to do this .
These organisms can sit out completely .
They can live under vacuum .
It 's absolutely sure that life exist in space , and you feel places to find new environments of water .
In the real , NASA showed that this is .
This is a picture of molecule that we 've built using these processed , just using these processes , just using the lights to insert .
The lights assemble .
This picture wasn 't taken with a microscope with a microscope , but with a microscope .
It 's a molecule we can see the whole with a microscope .
These are phophoto cover a time of about six seconds .
This is the adverage we did a little time ago .
They 're more than 580,000 letters of genetic code .
It 's the biggest molecule of a definite structure ever created by man .
It has a molecular weight to 300 million .
If you 're going to stick with a 10 without spaces , they would like 142 page to transcalculate this genetic code .
Now , how do we work ?
Of course , we tramite a virus is a game of kids .
It 's a little bit more complicated when you use bacteria .
It 's simply simple when it comes from the eucariods like our : you can just get the nucleo and put another , which is basically the process of cloning .
In the archaea , the chromosoma is integrated in the cell , but we recently demonstrated that we 're able to do a complete complete train a cell cell of a cell cell of another and activate it .
We clear a chromosoma partpartpartpartpartpartpartpartpartpartpartpartpartpartpartpartpartpartpartpartpartpartpartpartpartpartpartpartpartpartpartpartpartpartpartpartpartpartpartpartpartpartpartpartpartpartpartpartpartpartpartpartpartpartpartpartpartpartpartpartpartpartpartpartpartpartpartpartpartpartpartpartpartpartpartpartpartpartpartpartpart
The two are different as men from the topes .
We added some gene in the way to decide what to do to do for this chromosoma .
The skid up with the main way to kill all the proteins .
And when we put it in the cell was stupendo-- and you will appreciate our graph graph -- the new chromosophisticato-- the new chromosophisticatoes -- the new chromosophisticatoooked -- and you open our own own own safety .
And we started thinking that we couldn 't go beyond , but we tried to do that more in there .
This is one of the major mechanisms of evolution .
We found that very much species have added a second , or a third chchromosoma somewhere , added in a second thousand new tracks to the species .
So who thinks about evolution as a only gene to the evolution that has not been understood free of biology .
They 're all the relationship called me restrippping to restripping DNA .
The chromosoma that was in the cell not possible one .
The cell ph---chmosoma that we put serito----cell cell .
You expressed , and he recognized the other chromosoma as material , he has masticked , and we 've been bored , and we 've been bored with only the cell and the new cell .
It became blue because of the genes we put it .
And in a briefly leverse of time , all the characteristics of a species , you 've gone to lose , and it turned out of a new species , based on the new species , based on the new software we have serted in the cell .
All the proteins are changed , the members are changed , and when we read the genetic code , and when we read the equivalent to what we have transfit .
Now , this may seem alchmy genetic , but altering the software , but altering the software to change things in a kind of substantial .
Now , I 've already explained that there is not about genesesis -- but to progress from three million years and a half million evolution , and I said that maybe we 're going to create a new version of Cambrian expensive version of Cambrian explosion , where they 're going to be created new species on this digital process .
Why do you do that ?
I think that 's enough to our needs .
We 're going to go from six billion and a half billion people in the next 40 years .
Right to give an example : I was bored in 1946 .
Now there are three people on the planet for each , there 's three people in 1946 ; there will be four .
We 're having problems now to find food , fresh and clean , medical medical and heaven , and you 're in the way , and a half billion people .
It will be more than that we can do it for nine billion .
We use more than five billion of the carbon , more than 30 billion baries , more than 30 billion baries .
That means a millions of baries a day .
When we try to find biological processes , or any kind of process to remove them , it will be a huge challenge .
We have to keep the whole whole emission of CO2 to these materials that goes in the atmosphere .
In today , thank you today , thank you all the world , we have a database with about 20 million genes , and I like to think that are the design components for the future .
The electronics is just a dozen of about components , and think about how many different things are coming out .
Our limits here are the data here is the realm of the reality and our imagination .
Now we have a techniques , thank you very quickly about this , in the synthetization of the synthetization , we can create what we call genomical genomical genomical .
We can build a big robot that can make a big robot that can produce a million calculus a million chromosomes a day .
Think of processing these 20 million genes , or to get to optimize the processing to make either , new vaccines , we can change , because of a little team , and we can change , because of a little team , and create more biology molecular biology now now that in the last 20 years of science .
And it 's just a standard selection .
We can choose to survival , chemical production or coual , production of chemistry , with vacception of vacceping .
This is an instantaneous instantaneous instantaneous instantaneous instantances and design species to do .
Well , we don 't know what they 're going to be .
We know exactly how it is their genetic code .
Now we 're focusing on the fourth of the fourth of the fourth of the fourth of the fourth of the fourth of the fourth of the fourth of the fourth of the fourth of the fourth of the fourth generation .
You 've seen you who are also to extract thanol to be an experiment , it was a finite experiment .
We have the second , and third generation that are using enough to be used enough to be herself as as the higher of the highest value , as the ran or different kinds of butanol .
But the only way that biology can have a big impact without increase the cost of the food and limit the cost of food and limit would be transformed the CO2 of the matter , before , for which we 're working to design the CO2 , first , so we think of the first carbon .
The solar light combine combinated with CO2 is a metodo-- but in our discoveries , we found different metods .
This is a organism we described in 1996 .
It 's in the ocean ocean , at about 2,500 feet of the deep foundity of the water .
They have to do with CO2 using hydrogen molecular as a source of energy .
We 're trying to figure out if we can intubs the CO2 , which can easily be translated to tramite with your covers , to make that CO2 in the carbon , to make this process .
So , we think we could be able to be able to increase what the question of , " which is the question of " which is the Noobidden , we know -- we have the goal of the replace to the oil industry .
Exactly . If you can 't do that from TED , where you can ?
It would be a main of energy .
And we 're working for using the same metods to to create vaccines .
You 've seen this year with the influence , we always 're going to go back to a dollar , and with a dollar , when it 's going to find the waccine .
I think that what you can change is building vaccine to be building vaccines in the ancient .
So , this is how the future could start to change , now , the tree of evolution , and then the tree of evolution , with the eucknic , arches , and infinally cell .
We 're so on the improve people .
Our discovery is to do so so that we live enough to live enough to try to do it . Thank you very much .
So , first of all of you will show you , the fast , the fastest , of the new technology we brought to a buy newspaper almost a year ago . This is Seadragon .
It 's about a environment where you can interact is at the local level of visual data that remote with a huge amount of data data .
Here we 're seeing a lot of gigabyte of digital photos with a kind of zoom , and continuous , for a panoramic panoramic , and we have the images as we want .
And it doesn 't matter how big it is the amount of information that we see , how big these things are these things like data or the images of data or the images .
Most of digital photographs , but this is a scanning scanning from the the library of the Congress of the Congress , and reenter in the 300 megaxel .
It doesn 't make any difference because the only thing that you have the prestations of a system like this is the number of pixel on your screen in any time . It 's also a very fflessible architecture .
This is a book , for example of data not images .
This is Casa desolate of Dickens . Every colonna represents a capital .
To show you that 's just about the task and not about images , we can do something like this , to see that this is about a real representation of the task , not a picture .
It could be a little artificial book to read a electronic book book .
Don 't advice .
This is an example of the realistic example . It 's a number of the Guardian .
Every picture is the beginning of a sex-in-sex-in-infor-up .
And you really know , you really know , the wonderful experience of the paintings of the real version of a review of a review or a quotidian , which is for a molteplus of a a little bit of a a kind of a half .
We also did something with the corner of this particular number of the Lardian .
We 've created a fashion ads to the higher resolve -- much more than that you use in a normal adversus -- and we put you of the contain .
If you want to see the careful of this car , you can see here .
Or other models , or even the specific models .
And this really shows some of these ideas to eliminate the limits of the construction of the boundary .
We hope this is the question to put up to the pop-up and other porcheries , don 't have to be necessary .
Of course , the map is one of the most obvious applications for this kind of technology .
And on this is not going to lose time , if we don 't want to say that we have contribute to give them in this field .
These are all the streets in the United States , there are all the street of a geospacecrain in NASA .
So now we 're going to do something else .
So this is actually actually from the vial on the web ; you can go to see it .
It 's about a project called Photosynth , which combine two different technologies .
One is Seadragon and the other is a visual research in the computer , very interesting , by Noah Snavely , a student of the University of Washington , with the aid of the UW Seitz of the UW Szeliski Rick Szelisi of Microsoft Research .
And it 's from the vial of the Weadragon .
You can see it when we do this kind of patterns , where we can go from one image to another one of the image to the other and have this kind of experience to the multiple .
But the space of the imagination of the images here has actually a meaningful meaning .
The algorithms of the computer have recorded these images together , so that they 're going to restect the things that you 've been doing the images -- all the clossslague to the Grasis Montagne Roccious doadesizes -- you 're scacked . Here you can see the elements of a slide , and these things are all the spaced in the space of the world .
I don 't know if I have time to show you some other environment .
There are some more spacececrain .
I want to go directly to one of the original data of Noah-- and this proof from a previous prototype of Photosynthy that we 've done for the first time time time , I 'll show you what I think is really the key key to show you that we 're going to be the key to show this technology , Photosynthrows . And it 's not necessarily by looking at the environments that we put in the world .
We had to worry about the legal things and forth .
This is a reconstruction of Nototer of Notototpractice , and you can see the Nototer Dame . Basta digm , and you get images of the type , and you get images of these things in the magic field , and you know , you have a picture of this picture that is discovery appear to this model .
So they are all images from Flickr and they 're all connected to the spacecrain in this way .
And it 's possible to be able to be able to be very simply .
You know , I would never think of finish to work for Microsoft .
It 's very gratifying to get this kind of accooking here .
I think you can see that this is a lot of different types of photos : from those of the cell phones to those of the SLR , a meaning number of meaning , put together in this environment .
And if you can , I try to try to look at those more strange .
Many are blown from faces , etc .
Somewhere you have a series of photographs -- which is a series of photographs -- which is .
This is a poster of Notototer , the registrated correctly .
We can go from the poster to the physics of this environment .
The essential point is that we can do things with social environment . This is now taking data from the whole memory of the whole memory , from the whole thing to the Earth , from the visual point of view -- and connects all those data together .
All those photos become connected together , the major of the parts .
You have a model of land that emerges .
Think about this as the prolunging of Stephen Lawler on Earth .
It 's something that grow in complexity as the people use it , and the people who use it , and the advantages to increase with use .
Their phophoto are hushed with other people .
If you get the idea of to contrast to be able to draw all of these things say , my photo catthedral of the Nototer of all those data , and I can use all those data , and I can use how to be using the inresulve to the immergers of the things that are , in that metaphone-moon and cross-use of the kind of cross-moon and use .
Of course , a consequence of all of this is virtual models of the expensive models of the land , the way that 's interesting , you know , you 're going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be , but from the memory .
Thank you .
Chris Anderson : I understood ? What your software is that your software will tell us to do is that at some point , in the next few years , all the photographs share they going to be practically connected to it ?
BAA : Yeah . What 's doing is doing in practical .
It 's creating the hyperlink , if you want , between images .
And it 's doing it in the base of the images .
The thing becomes very interesting if you think about the rcheality of the semanties of these images , which are going to be a lot of these images .
As you do a research of the Web , you have a phrase and the text on the web page is a lot of information about the images of photo .
Now , what happens if that photo you all the images ?
So the amount of interconnection and the amount of rchemistry and the amount of rchemize is really huge . It 's a classic classic effect of the network .
CA : Blaise , it 's really incredible . Compliments .
BAA : BAt : Bank you very much .
One of the main likely when you travels and one of the dolphetnographics is the able to live between who who has no mented the antials of the antials of the past , the spring of the past , you have the past in the wind , you 're going to be in the plants , the spaper , the guess of the plants ,
Basti to think that the monans Jaguar vide vide , and the Milky Lattea , or that the monites of Inuit are still in the same meaning , or in Himalaya , the good good good , or in the middle of the Charma , but that the idea that the central of the world , and the idea that the world are not in which we live in the world , but that the idea that the world are not just a model of reality , but it is a model of reality , but it 's the idea that the idea that the idea that the idea that the way ,
the consequence of a particular particular set of choices that our styres has done , well , very bad , very , very bad , many generations ago .
And , of course , we all share of the essential tracts .
We all proof it . We all proof .
We 're subjects to come up with .
We need to deal with the inexorability of death , so we don 't surprise if we 're going to be able to do that .
We all have a art .
What does is the particular rhythm of the song , the rhythm of the dance of every culture .
Not the most of the Is of the forests of the Borneo , or the Waooodoo of the Haiti , or the Kenya , or the Kenya settle-writing , or a cammellipt-up , or a cammadow in the heart of the Sahara .
He was my company in the desert a month ago , or a month ago , or a lifffeter of Qomolangme , on the Everest , the world 's mother .
All of these people teach us that are other ways of exists to think , other ways of thinking , other ways of moving in the world .
And if you reflect a second , it is a concept that can give you hope .
In the whole , the mirid of the world creating a ragnote of life , creating a ragnote of the planet and the cultural life of the planet as the way the planet as the as the ragnote as biosphere .
And you can think about this cultural ragnosphere , as a hetnosphere , and you can defining the etnosphere , and you can define the whole concepts , intuitions , intuitions , intuitions , intuitions can be from the human imagination from the human imagination of consciously .
The etnosphere is the fantastic pathrimony of humanity .
It 's the symbol of what we 're and what we can be in how much species .
And because the biosphere was a big consumed , was very very , very , very , very quickly , and unfortunately ,
No biological , for example , would say that 50 percent of all the species is in the organ is about the orlo of the exintion simply because it 's father , or the more apocalm -- in the earth of biological diversity -- in the authority of biological diversity .
And the indede of this is , of course , the language .
When you were born in there were 6,000 language on this planet .
A language is not composal by a blocknic , or a series of rules of grammicals .
And one language is the spring of the human spirit .
It 's the half of the animal that animum of every culture comes in the material world .
Every language is a forest , a forest , a backin , a thought , a thought of the inspiritual .
And of those 6,000 language , as we 're here in Monterey , at least the mid-half half not more soon is to be surrying in the orecchies of children .
They don 't get to children , the people who want to say , to less that 's not the thing that they 're already death .
What is the most sad of being aved from the silence , to be the last few to talk about a language , of the way to talk about the saggeel of the saggeel of the children ?
This is a little bit of a state of someone in the world every two weeks : every two weeks , every two weeks , every two weeks , and a door and the tomb , the last silabs of a language .
And I know someone who will say , " Do you don 't know that ?
The world would not be a better place if we 're talking about all the same language ? " Well , then we all talk about yoruba . Paris we all talk about the dotonese .
We talk about kogue .
You 're about a tract thing that means not to talk about your language .
I 'd like to do you to do a journey through the etnosphere --
a little journey in the etnosphere to give you a source of what we 're losing .
Many of us destand that when I say , " different ways of exists , " I mean , very different ways of exist .
We take for example , Barasana , in Amazonia , in the Speaceentric , the popular of the anaconda , which crede the mixed of the latte of the sandwest in the sandandwest of the sacond of the sacond of the sacond of the sacond of the sacond of the anacond of the laats of the saconda ,
It 's about a popular popular that is not able to distinguess the blue color of the blue blue , because you 're identify in the forest , which depends on the popular .
They have a strange language and a major rule , called " exogamia language , " You have to be a different language .
All of this has radical past mitolologic , yet , yet the particularity is that in these families and extent that you 're talking about six or seven language to the maps of the maps of the maps .
They limited listen to listen and then start talking .
We take one of the most interesting tribe I lived with the most interesting tribe I lived , the Waorans of Ecuador , an incredible popular people who had the first contact contact in 1958 .
In 1957 , five missionarith-missionarith-mistake .
They did the photographs that they were taken them to come back to the photographs that they would have to love , and forest , and forest that this popular forest had never seen anything bi-dimensional .
They collected the picture of the early , they 've been spent to the research of a shape , or a shape , and they were killed by the rushed that they were treated at five missionary missionary with the lance .
But the Waorans don 't kill the southern .
They kill you in them .
54 percent of the mortality was caused to them .
We 've been sitting in eight generations and we found two cases of natural death and when we 've been sitting in to know , they had been aged that one of them was invective , and then they were killed , and then they killed the same .
The cruers were able to recognize the animal , from 40 steps and recognize the species .
In the first ' 80s , I 've been assigned a really interesting task when my professor of Harvard , if I wanted to go to Haiti to Haiti to sweapons between the society of the Womer and the Tonton Macouvalier and Tonton Macoud , and immedians to do the sets .
To give a sense of miracolous , I would have to understand the Vodoo culture , and that Vodoo is not magner .
It 's quite a complex vision , a metaphical vision of the world .
Many interesting interesting .
If you ask me to tell me the great religions of the world , what do you ?
Cristianesimum , Islam , Budddism , Ebraism , etc .
A continent is always left out , I think the sub-Saharan Africa has no religious feeds . And they 're all the way of these things that distiled the distilside of these concepts in the tragic tragic , and the Voodoo is not the other than the slavery of the slavery .
What makes the interesting voodoo is the intended between life and death .
So the vision they hired to be the spiritual .
The spirites can be invocked from the Grande Acqua , resonent to the end of the dance and they have the temporary time to the soul of the vive in the way that for a very short time , the follows becomes the .
So , for this voodooists like to say , " You know , white you go to talk about God .
We say , we say , " We say God . "
And from the moment you 're you 're a posseat , is the spirit that you 're driving you , how can you do it in the bad ?
So you 're in these incredible events : following the voodoo in the state of trance that touches are impunted to the infuoccurred a rather fort of the power of the mind when it 's catalyalized in a state of extreme of the power of the mind when it is catalyalized .
You 've lived all the people who lived the most extraordinary of the Sierra Nevada Santa Marta , in the Colombia .
Desthrows of the macivilization that once a living on the carais-planes of Colombia in the conquatic planes , the popular of the major of the maintain of the major the planes of the boundary ,
In a continent , in a continent , this popular , this popular is never been conquisted by the spaged .
There are government today are governmented by a clero , but their formation is so extraordinary .
The young people follows are taken from the families to three or four years , and live secregated in a world of good and hombat at the bottom of the bottom of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the basic ,
Two dods of nine years choices to reproduce the noves of the noves months of the trade of the mother , now are metaphor in the user of the mother of the Mad .
So , for this time , they 're acculturate to the values of their society , values that make their prayer , and just their prayer , and just to say the cost of the conversal equilibrium -- or to say the balance .
In the term of this incredible initiation , they 're improvised out and for the first time in their life , at 18 years , they see a high high school . And in that active , when the sun the sun , when the sun the sun of beautiful paesthesist , everything that they learned in theory is , what they 've learned in theory . The first splendor . The first thing is going to go back and say , and he says , and he says , and say , and it 's saying , and it 's saying ,
" Where ? I said , " Where I said .
It 's stupend . Now it 's about you protect it . "
They call it the major fraters and say that we , brothers , the little minor of the world .
This level of intuition is extremely important .
When we think about invoy-invote and the environment of the wild Rousseau and the old story of the noble notion , which is a concept of razarm in his simplicity , we 're close to the Earth .
The indebolites are not feeling the black popular .
There 's no space for these things in the palual palud of the Asmaller , but thank you to the Tibet , but thank you to the time and retle , they 've created a mystics of the Earth is not the concept of the Earth is not the concept of the Earth can live because it 's not about the first thing that the Earth can live because it is because it 's infuse of human consciousness .
What does that mean ?
And he means that a girl of Ande who grew up creating that mountain is a spirit of the Apu who will be a very different human being destiny , and it will have a different human being desteply different with the mountain of the Montana , which is a little bit different mountain with the mountain of rock is a mass of rock of rock of rock of rock .
That 's the dimora of a spirit or a mineral cuth , it was irrelevant .
What 's interesting is the metaphor that defines the relationship between the individual and the natural world .
I grew up in the forests of Columbia credly cret that forests to be cut up .
And this reso a human being different from my friends Kwakiutl that believe that the forests are the demnow of Hukuk and the band the band the band the spiriti 's historous , and the spiritual spirits that they live in the same same same same same same same .
If you start to look at that these cultures can create different reality , you can start to understand some of their own feelings . We take this plants .
I 've been taken this picture of aprile in the nordoccccial Amazonia .
Mayahuash of you have heard about the ayahuasca , the most powerful psycoat repertosthrows .
What makes fascinating the ayahuash is not the potential of the substance of the substance , but his elaboration . It 's composal to two elements .
And in the one side , this lian lian lian lian side of the cool of the cool of the cooline , the harmolins , slightly sleeps .
To take the only plants , you have a fum fum fum that altera little bit of the consciousness , but it 's mixed with the coffee of the coffee of the coffee of the coffee of the coffee of the coffee of the coffee of the coffee ,
This plants is a plant powerful plants , very similar to serotonin , dimethyltryptamine-5 , methoxylloyltrypamine .
If you ever see the Yanomami , you 'll be the hand-up , the substance that they do from a different set of species , anchchis contains .
Tiring that polust on the nose is a little bit like to be disappeared by a card of the boeyes and land on a sea of electricity . [ Resate ] not believe a destoration destain .
I was often a lot of my professor , Richard Evan Shultes , the man who had been a psychchcheap , with his discovery of the fungi to the fungi , with his discovery of the fungi in the ' 30 in Mexico .
I think my tesis , you can 't classificate these triptamine as as the hallucinated because if you can 't tell anybody to be hallucinated . They can 't tell anybody to be hallucinated . They can 't actually be assured by a mainly , because they 're denied by a maintain , that 's natural ,
It 's possible to be assumerely if you 're assum with other chemical chemical checks to denize the MAO .
Now , the beautiful Is : Is the Is that they find in this lian injititites are injitites of MAO , the same kind of necessary to potential the triptamine . The question is the question : in a flour popular , like these popular people who are not like this , but if you combine in this way , they believe in this way , they believe in this way , they believe a real sophochemical version of the sum ?
We use the great euured of the proof of the proof and error , that can reveal .
But if we ask the Indians , they 'll tell us , " The pilots of people are talking about . "
What does that mean ?
This tribe , the Cofan , he has 17 variety of ayahuasks , which are born in the forest , and that you would go into the same species .
If you ask them how to stabilide their tassonoms will tell us , " I thought , " I thought I was understood about the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of them ? "
The solution is : you take the 17 variety of the moon in a night and each one will have a different piena and each one door .
So , you don 't 't read in Harvard , but it 's much more interesting that content the stami .
Now , [ [ applaushers ] the problem is that even the ones of us who have to heart people find them in the paintings are pittoresks , but in some way , in the margins of the history of our world , and pass .
In fact , the X-century , between 300 years , it will not be remember to the guerre or innovation technologic innovations , but rather as the thing we were stopped and used to hold , and we 're in the destroying the mass of the the mass of the diversity of the world . Now the problem is not the change .
All the cultures through the centuries were involved in a dance for new chance of life .
And the problem is not the technology .
The Indians are Sioux to be Sioux when they put up from the arch and they 're doing so as Americans don 't have stopped to be American , when they put from the horsea and calm .
It 's not the change or technology that are threatening the integrity of the etnosphere . It 's the power .
The hard of the domination .
And if you give a look at the world , you 'll find that these are not cultures of these are not stinated to disappear .
They 're living and dinnamic , spints out of the forces out of the forces of the forces of the forces of their adaptation .
I know that 's disboboscing in the painting of the Penan --
a popular nor , the Sarawak , in the earth of the airplane , a popular popular to a generation , and now reduced to a generation ago , and now reduced to the service and the prostitution on the reverse of the fies of the fiume , where you can see the fiume inquinese Mar Cinese , where the Meric sweet , where the r.
With reach to reempize the stones with the subtact to the forest .
Or , in the Yanomami , are the disease that I 've got to the discovery of the gold .
If we 're moving on the Tibet , where I 'm doing a lot of research , you 'll see the hard of the political domination .
As you know the genocide , the physics of a popular popular , is convicted to the level of the life of a popular lifetnocide , the destroy of life , not just is convicted , but advanced to be a popular , but I will be celebrate in the development of the development .
And you can 't understand the suffering of Tibet until you 're in the beginning .
I 've been path the 6,000 miles from Chengdu in China through the Western Tibet , and I came to Lhasa young connection , but only came to Lhasa young connection , but only came to Lhasa , I realized what we feel about .
6,000 mixrate hands in the cheap and ceneted .
1.2 million people killed by the military in the Cultural Rivolution .
The father of this guy was ascritical in the Panchen Lama .
The means that it was killed to the temple of Chinese invasion .
Her was worse with Sua Santity in Santity in Santity that has taken the popular in Nepal .
Sa mother was imprigioned and his colsh was rich .
It was brought to the age of two years in the age of two years in his nose because it could not have to live without him .
The sister , which has done the same , it was mitted in reeducational reeducation .
A day he was a little bit of calculated fashion a writing fashion , and for this transgression , it was mitted to the work for seven years .
Tibet of Tibet can be inoveroveroveroveroveroveroveroveroveroveroveroveroveroveroveroveroveroveroveroveroveroveroverwhelming .
And then , all of the time , you reduce to a choice .
We want to live in the world world world 's the monothromath or we want to accover the world policy ?
The great anthropologiogue , Margaret Mead , before he said that his biggest was that , in our way to go to this vision of the world , not just see the whole gama of the world , we don 't just see the whole gama of the human imagination , but one day we 're going to see that they were other possibly possibly .
And it 's umillion to remember that our species is exist for 60,000 years .
The Rivolution , the Neolitics , who gave us the agriculture , which has done us us to fight the cult of the smomovement of the sleaming of the sleaming of the smountain , creating the gerarchia specialization of the sorts of specialization .
modern world industrialized has been in the world 's been there .
And so that 's not suggest to me that we don 't suggest that we have the answers to all the challenges we have to deal in the millennia to come .
When to these myriads of the world is asked what humans to say to be human , they 're going to be human , they get a different voices .
And it 's in these answers that we all have the chance to be what we 're : a kind of conscious , which has to make all the people in the way that all of the people and the garden can fiorth . And there 's great moments of the optimism .
I 've been taken this picture on the northern extremity of Baffin , when I went to cause of the whales with Inuit , and this man , Olaya , Olaya , and this man , Olaya , he was told me a wonderful story of his grandfather .
The government government government has not always been waste with the popular Inuit and the ' 50s to stabilifests our prematives , we 've got them in colonies .
The grandfather of this man refuted to go .
The family , themelting for his life , he took me all the glasses , and all of his attacts .
You have to know that Inuit don 't tems the freezing the cold , they do it .
The pattins of the sleds in the origin were made of pain in the pain of paper .
The grandfather of this man didn 't have been intimight from the library , or from the library , which was suffered .
It 's sleeped , you 've been calculated the pile in the skin ball and defecked in their hand . When I did I did this , you 've got the lama .
It 's springed on the pointed of this coltelem of this hell and when he came up , he killed a dog .
It 's a cycle , and created a brilaughter , with the cass , he made a sleththy , and he 's disappeared on the banks , and he 's disappeared on the banks , he 's a guns , he 's sleep in the remain .
Do we want to talk about cavarsely with nothing ? [ Ruate ] . ] And this , in different ways , [ Applausi is the symbol of the popular Inuit and all the popular popular the world .
In the april government , 1999 , the downn-of-of-of-territory control of an area of the largest California and Texas mmesss .
It 's their new paa . It 's called Nunut .
It 's a independent territory . They do all the resources .
One splendido example of how a natione-state could rerecognize with his popular .
And , to finish , I think is quite obvious at least in those remote song of us , the world 's been in these remote , and realize that they 're not really deal with .
For someone is home .
They represent sexual imagination that sets up to the background . And for all of these children , like the dreamof these children , like the dreams of the swide of the geography of the hope .
First , we know about National Geographic , we convinced the politicians will never come to anything .
We believe that the polemic --
[ Applausi ] are not persuasive , but we believe that stories can change the world , and maybe we can change the world , and maybe we 're the best institution to tell the stories of the world . Every month of 35 million visits .
156 countries transmit to our television dog .
We revists are letters from millions of people .
Our work is traveling in the etnosphere to bring our audience in places that will go to the main places that will go out to the blow of how they 've seen , and , they hope , abbraccers , they will be the central reveal in the world , and we have to find a lifestyle world , and then we have to find a lifestyle in a pluralist and multicultural systems to be in a life in a world and cultural world of life in a pluralist and cultural world ,
where the wisdom of all the people can contribututing to our weleventually to our weleved .
Thank you .
I 'm going to talk about some things that I wrote in this book that I hope you 've heard and I 'll try to prove some some connections , in the case you don 't notice .
I would start with what I call the " dogma official dogma . "
The official dogma of what ?
The dogma official dogma of all the Western industrial society dogma , if we want to massive the weld of our citizens . " If we want to massive to do that is massive freedom . "
The reason is , from one side , in fact that freedom is in itself a value , is pretious , is pretious , essential for human beings .
And then we do that if we 're free , we 're sitting , each of us can do to do this for all that massimilar to our well-being , without any one that we 're all about .
The way to massive freedom is massive to choice .
More choices people have , more are libat , and the greater , and the largest freedom , the largest freedom , they are their well-being .
And that I think , that 's so deeply roadadicated in society that nobody would be able to put it in the doubt .
And it 's also deeply roaded in our lives .
I 'm going to show you some examples of what the progress has resived as possible .
This is my supermarket . It 's not particularly great .
I loved a simple note on on the inhand-up .
In my supermarket are 175 conditions , without content 10 of the extrite of the extrite of the extrade and 12 aceters that you can buy for the maintain of the inrescuse of the inceeful circumstance of your own degrees .
Here 's the supermarket .
And then you go to the store of electronics to buy a stereo : casse , lector , the CD , pileces , the CD .
And in this single store of electronics , there 's a big number of audio components .
We can make six million and a half million different combinations that are using the components that there are in a near store .
You have to admit that there 's very much choice .
Altri : the world of communications .
Once , when I was a child , you could get all the telephone service , to the pat the pat the mom of Bell .
You had the phone , you didn 't buy it .
And one consequence of this , between the other , was that the phone didn 't break .
These days are gone .
We have a variety of telephones , especially between the cell phones .
Here 's the cell phones of the future .
My favorite is in the middle , lettor MP3 , cut , tapeli and forced for the bruleless of the brulele .
If you don 't have seen the store under house , you 're near to be able to come .
And what happens is that the end happens is that people go into the negots and make this question . And you know what is the answer is " No .
It 's not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn 't do that too much .
So , in other things that are much more important than the acquire , you really know , the same explosion of choices .
Axxtistence : not happens in the United States that you go from the doctor and the doctor you have to do .
Instead , you go to the doctor , and the doctor says , " OK , we could do . " At this , or B , " Again , " Are these wweless wish and these answers . What do you want to do ? "
You say , " Dotore , what would I do ? "
And the doctor says , " A has these benefits and those bones , and B has these well-up well-up . "
" What do you want to do ? "
And you rebats , " Dotore if she was me , what would you do ? "
And the doctor : " But I 'm not . "
The result of the result of the maled , " expression that makes it look like a beautiful thing .
But actually it 's not that one smoil and responsibility to make decisions from someone who knows something , oks to someone who knows something , and it 's the doctor , to qualily anything -- and so it 's not about the ideal condition to make the patient decisions .
There 's a huge marketing of product companies , direct people like me and you , if you think , you know , there 's no sense , because you think you can 't understand them .
But if we can 't buy them , why do they have to be there ?
The answer is that they want to domorning , we call the doctor to be able to ask us to change the rich .
And what 's so fundamental as our identity is our identity is a question of choice , how you see in this vigness , " We don 't want to proof the children . They 're going to be the right right now , " We don 't know more a identity : we have to invent .
And we can reinvented us how many times you do it .
The means that every morning , at the answers , you have to decide that kind of person you want to be .
I spect to the family and marriage , a time time the common , unhappy , because it was about that you could have the most soon as possible , and he was to get the more soon as possible , and he started to make the fast as possible .
The only real choice was with who , not when , and you don 't even when you do .
Ose , all that 's really to play .
I 'm going to start very smart students , and I do 20 percent of the work than a time .
And it 's not because they are less less diligent .
but why are I impensive , I mean , I would say , " Would I say , " Would I do that ? "
" Do you get to be worried to me to think before the children or career ? "
I 'm interrogatives .
And they 're trying to answer these questions , even if this implands , not complete the companies that asseged and not to get a beautiful vote to my examples .
And they really have to do this . I 'm important questions .
Now , the work : we 're lucky , like Carl , because technology allows us to work every minute , every day , from every day , from every day , from every day , from every corner of the Randolph .
I 'm talking about , there 's a angle , and I didn 't tell anybody who , where the WiFi works .
I don 't tell you , because I want to use me .
What does this mean , this incredible freedom of choice that we have about work ? It 's to continue , if we have to work or not .
We can go to see our son toys , with the cell phone , with the cell phone in a pockberry , and the news , and the tebook , typically , on the ginock .
And even though they are all spent , every minute that we see our son , and we 're also asking the particians , we 're also asking this call ? "
" Do you answer this email ? I had to do this literally ? "
And when the answer is " no , " , this makes the experience of your partners very different from what it would be in other conditions .
So , anywhere we look at , little , things and great , materials , and great materials and life is a question of choices .
Once the world was this : Ovreal , there were some chance , but not all of choice .
The world of today is improve today : The dilemma is , " Is it a positive thing , or negative ? "
The answer is Sedom .
The positive latest latory , so I 'm going to talk about the negative .
All this choice compories two actually negative effects on people .
The first , paradoxally , is that produced paralysis that produced .
With many options between the things that choose , becomes very hard to do it .
I offer an example of meaning : a study of the flight of fly .
And my connects had access to this is a bunch of the Vances , the gigantic society of the source of the source of the source of the Since , 2,000 companies .
What she found is that for every 10 solutions that are offerte in more , the percentual of adesion , the percentual of two percent .
With 50 four-founds , there 's 10 percent of adesions than when they are available . Why ?
Because with 50 fourth between the hour-foundly , it 's maledly hard to decide , and choice is remanaged to the tomorrow .
And tomormormors , and I asked the tomormormormorning , and of course , the tomorrow , and of course , I never get .
You don 't mean to not just that these work from old who are going to be food for dogs because they don 't have enough money , it 's so ostics that they also lose the funny sourth of the work .
I don 't participating , they 're losing until five dollars for year from the dator of work , which would be brought to be true .
So the paralalisis a consequence of having the find of choices .
And I think that makes the world like this .
" And to finish , for the eternity : ketchup , or maion , or maion ? "
You would take the right decision , if it is for the right decision , if it 's for the eternity , right ?
You don 't want to choose the wrong , and you 're neighborhood , and neighborhood condition .
So this is the first effect . The second is that we also can also avoid the paralysis and doing a choice , at the end of how we would be done with less options of the result of the result of the result of the things that choose .
And this for different reasons .
One of those is that with many condition , you know , if you buy a little bit of the things that you would have been better to imagine that you would have been better to imagine that you could have been better . And that happens is that the alternative , you know , it 's the alternative imaginative , and the repeaking the sophisting of choice , and the replacement of the sophisted of the decision of the sophistic decision that you would have to make the sodden ,
And when it was a good decision .
More choices are , more is easy to displeasure of any detail that is insophister of choice .
And in fact , there is what economists call the expensive expensive .
Dan Gilbert has closy very well , like the value that we think about the value of things that we confront .
And that 's a lot of the options , it 's easy to represent the active characternative alternative shotate and be less soddisfactory of the option that you have choice .
Here 's an example . I 've been schools with all those who are not New York .
But that 's what you probably think you probably think .
There 's this couple of Hamptons .
A place of lussides .
Spiases splendida . It 's all about them . It 's all about them .
Not all of all . But what he thinks is , " Well , malbuildings , I 'm Agotten . "
" All my neighbors in Manhattan is . "
" I could talk about giving them right in front of your house . "
And he goes two weeks of the idea that 's losing -- every day -- every day -- the chance of parking , where it wants .
The expensive opportunity deminures the subsatifation for what we have , when the choice was a faster .
And the most are the options that we have to look at , the more the actical characteristics will come up with how expensive expensive .
Here 's another example .
This is a vision tells us a lot of things .
It 's about the living moment , and maybe in the living lenty .
But the most important point is that you choice , you go to do not do the other .
The things we don 't choose to be able to attractive , that can make less attractive what we do .
Three point : spiral growing of the expectations .
I tried to my skin buy buy a new couple of jeans .
I 'm almost always jeans .
And once the jeans were just like a kind , buy them and bought from the windows , they were discovered , just after I had them a life and work , they were showing them a lot of times , they started to go well .
So , I went to buy a couple of new when the old were gone , and I said , " I need a couple of jeans , this is my cut . "
The commit said , " Loows wants , fit , what 's releasy , released it ? "
Do you want to do with the cerniera ? " Stonebottles ? "
" Look wants ? "
" Women 't want to give them to hold it ? Bla bla -- " Continured to elenjoy .
I was swheeld , and after a little bit , I could say , " I want the guy that was the only guy who was , so for a time I tried to say , so I tried all of the jeans , and then I 'm using the miles of jeans , and I would use it .
It was the massive . I had the best thing I had to get the best .
But I feel worse .
Why ? I wrote a book for understood .
The reason I was worse was that with all the choice was that with all the choice were very very high , jeans had to be perfect .
I was wait minded . I didn 't wait about anything about that was just a guy , but when I saw a guy , but when I live in 100 different , steps , at least a kind of had to be perfect .
What I had been buy , but not perfect .
After you have a paragoned what I was trying to do is insubway of the expectations .
The add of options in life , it doesn 't do that increases that these are respect to the expection of the options of the same .
And this will properly less satisfaction , even when the results are good .
No one in the world of marketing if you realize .
Because if they knew it , you don 't know what I 'm talking about .
The truth looks like this .
" You had better when you were worse , " The reason you were better when you were worse when you were worse , when you were worse .
Ose , the world we live in -- opulents , industrialized citizens with expectative expectations of the performance we can hope is that the altel .
You don 't have surprised as you will be surprised because your expectations , my wait , you 're ungigantic .
The secret of happiness -- what you 're here -- is , " Bunch wait . "
I mean , little carographic moment -- which I really married and my wife is really amazing .
I couldn 't do better , I couldn 't do it .
But it 's not always a bad thing .
And finally , a consequence of buy , a couple of jeans discovers when you have just that jeans is that when you 're not satic , and you ask , " Why ? "
" Who is responsible ? " " " , the answer is clear .
The world is the responsible . What could you do you ?
When there are hundreds of the jeans , and you buy a insubjective , and you ask you who are responsible , and you ask you who responsible to you .
You could do better .
With hundreds of variety of variety , there are not a fairly insuccess .
So when people take decisions , even though the result is to be sitting , they 're saving , and they 're saving their own .
In the last few years , the depression is explows in the industrialized world .
I think a meaning factor -- not the only one , but important -- of this honave of the depression is that people have experiences because the standard experiences because the standard is too high .
And when they have to explain this situation think that the colame is they think about their own .
So the final result is that in general , we 're better , objectively , but we feel worse .
Let me remember you .
This is the official dogma , what we all take for good and it 's completely father . It 's not true .
There 's no doubt that a little bit of choice is better than you don 't have to do it , but it doesn 't really really really make a little choice is better than a little bit of a little bit .
There 's a critical value . I don 't know what it is .
But I 'm sure we 've super-scale we 've super-scale that the best choices to improve our life .
Now , from the political point of view -- I almost finite -- from the political point , the nocccut is the following .
What allows this whole choice in the industrial society is the material rchemical rich .
There are many places in the world , and you know , you know , you know , where the problem is not that they have to find out of choice .
The problem is that they too too few .
So the factory I 'm talking about is a malbeing exclusive , the rich society of modern , rich society .
And what it does to press and climbs is this : Steve Levitt talked about how those expensive and discoveries of those expensive and the bababs to blood . It 's a spent of money .
I mean these choices , complicated and available , it 's not that they 're just inuseful .
I advice ice .
They 're worse .
If you have a little bit of what our society was allowed to be reversated in those where people have too few chance , it would not just have their life to improve , but our life .
This is what economists call a very very very very very very , very , very , very , very , very , very , a kind of paretian .
A redistribution of the income re-based re-based re-based regret , not just to the poor -- because of this choice in the excess of it .
To conclude , you can become everything you want to be all of you --
You know , people of culture , you think , " But what does that fish ? "
" It 's obvious that you can 't make anything in a bock of glass . "
" A imagination , a limited vision of the world --
and I 'm going to be the interpretate so , in the beginning .
But then , I think , instead , I realized that fish knows the long knows the long way .
Because the reality of fact is that if you mand in frantums the bocce , so that you can 't do the freedom . You get the paralysis .
If you break the bock in the way that everything is the possible possible deminured the soddisdisfation .
You can get the paralysis , and you 'll reduced the weless .
Everybody needs a sphere .
This is almost certainly too quickly , maybe even in the fish , and it 's sure for us .
But the above some symbolic symbolic sphere is a rich for infeless and , for the midden .
Thank you very much .
