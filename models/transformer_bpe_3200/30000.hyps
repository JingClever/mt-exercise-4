Last year , I showed these slides to show that the ice ice ice ice ice ice ice ice ice ice ice ice ice ice ice ice , for almost three million years , had the size of 48 United States , it 's 40 percent .
But this subvaluable to the gravity of the problem because it doesn 't show the spreading of the ice .
The glacial calotter is , in a sense , the clear heart of the global climate system .
It turns out you winter and you get ritira .
The next slide is going to be a rapid carrelated to the last 25 years .
The paces are signed in red .
As you see , they expand until the blue scure .
That 's the ice in the winter , which is ritira .
You can see that cosidamage , five years or more , is like blood , which is like blood , which is like blood , which is like blood .
In 25 years , it 's been over the way .
This is a problem because the heat the whole thing about the ice heat around the ocean , where there are enormous amounts of carbon congrimelated carbon .
I think I 'm going to remote the totality of global warming , that quantity may doubled , super-scale , it may doubled this point .
In some little laghi 's deep in Alaska a meter is already rebolling from the water .
The professor Katey Walter of Alaska University of Alaska was a lbass letting the last last winter .
Video : Wow ! Al Gore : Wow ! Al Gore : if we 're going to be .
A reason is that this termal exchanger Groenland from the northermorth .
This is a river in the hyacial regime .
The landed never reached to the similar .
This is the Kangerlussuaq , in the Southwest of the Groenland .
If you want to know how the sea level for the sea for the leaving of the ice on the ground , here 's where the sea .
These currents are increasing .
The other side of the planet : Antarctica , the largest block of the planet .
The last month scientists have dichieve that the bills of the ice is in the negative , and that the Western Antarctica , which is particularly in the shelter .
Equials at six feet feet of the bottom , like Groenland .
Sulil Himalaya , the third largest block of ice , you see new laghi , which few years ago were glaciers .
40 percent of the world population was half of the world 's population from the melting water from that leaving .
Sulle Ande : this glacier is the source of this city .
The luck is increased .
But when it diminule is the same happens to the water .
In California , the snow on the Sierra Nevada is deminuity decrease .
The idricers are in the crisis .
The predictions , as you have read , they 're good .
The growth safterwards is a remarkable of the world .
The environmental disaster environmental disaster outside the normal and without precedented .
Four times more numheres in the last 30 years of the previous 75 .
This is a whole insustainable way .
If you look at the contextual contexts .
In the last five years we added 70 million tons of CO2 every 24 hours -- 25 million tons of tons in the ocean every day .
Look at the Eastern area of the Eastern Pacific , to the west , and on both the parts of the Indian aving oxygen , where there is a radical oxygen in the ocean .
The major causes of global warming , together to deforestation , which is 20 percent , is the fossil fuel use .
The oil is a problem , and the carbon is even worse .
The United States is one of the two more emissions , together to China .
And he was proposing to build a lot of other carbon core .
But we 're seeing a direction changing direction .
These are the anno-blinded projects over the last few years and some green proposals .
Everyway , there 's a politics fight in our country .
The carbon industry and oil industry have spent 250 million dollars in the last year to promoting carbon , which is a oxide .
And I 'd remembered me to something --
So , you see Natal Tennessee , where I live , there was a loss of 3.8 billion ligalls of carbon dioxide .
Maybe you saw it on news .
This is the second largest flow of the floor in America .
It happened around Christmas .
The publicity of one of the carbon industry was this .
Video : Still : Spy the carbon is a kind of allegry and happy .
It 's abundant here in America , and it grow our economy .
Frosty the carbon is increasingly .
It 's good price , adorable and the workers are the workers .
Al Gore : So , here 's a lot of the West Virginia .
The biggest mineral society on the mountains is Massey Coal . This is his administrator .
Video : Don Blankenship : I 'm going to have clear -- Al Gore , Harry Reid -- they don 't know what they 're talking about .
Al Gore : So the Alleance for the Clima has launched two campaign .
This is a thing , a part .
Video : Acore : ALergy : Alla COALergy : ALergy : Actually , he 's a threat at at at our business .
So , our priority is to invest a lot of money in a effort to make public and confused to make public and confused the truth .
In fact , carbon is not sporite .
We think it 's clean -- it 's also a good profum .
So , not precupatitory of climate change .
So , let 's do .
Video : Acore : Carbone -- you 've heard a lot of a lot of speaking .
So let 's take a turn into a little bit to the avanange structure for how much coal .
Straordinary ! The machines are a little raorous , but this is the sound of carbon technology .
The carbon consumption is between the main causes of global warming , but the remarkable technology that you see changes everything .
Day a look at this : this is the hodies of clean carbon technology .
Al Gore : Indeed , the positive alternative alternative security and that 's national security .
Video : The America is in crisis ; America 's economy , the national security , the national security crisis .
The file that connects all : our dependence by fossil fuel , like fossil fuel , like the sports and oil imported .
Now , there 's a new , audace solution to use it .
Repower : 100 percent of clean energy , in 10 years .
A plan to put America to work , make us sure more , and to help us stop the global warming .
Finally , a solution that dated to solve our problems .
Repower . You 're more .
Al Gore : This is the last .
Video : The way , it 's about to report America .
One of the fastest ways to bring the dependence from the combustible to killing our planet .
So , the future is here . Very , a new energy network .
Compars for two : Novi investments for good people .
Comment : Repower America . It 's time to be realists .
Al Gore : A old proverbio African says , " If you want to go fast , you go to yourself .
If you want to go back together . "
We have to go away , fast .
Thank you very much .
Last year at TED , I would make a introduction on the LHC .
And I promise to get back to how the machine works .
So here I have . And for those that time there were no , the LHC is the largest scientific experiment ever ever tried -- 27 kilometers of circumsted .
His task is to rereconstructions that were present less than a billion billion times a second from the beginning of the universe -- to 600 million times a second .
All of this is just environment .
This is the machine under the Ginevra .
We 're going to take these little Big Bang in the detectors .
This is what I work . It 's called ATLAS -- is 44 feet has a diameter diameter of 22 meters .
This is a spectacular picture of ATLAS in building this , you can see proportions .
Ten september last year , we got the machine for the first time .
And this picture was taken by ATLAS .
It was because of immend festeggiving in control .
It 's a picture of the first particles that had done all over the LHC , entering in collision , by a part of LHC , and spreading particles into the detector .
In other words , when we see that , we see that , 10 september , we realized that the machine worked , which is a great wictory .
I don 't know if it was this to exultate more or this , when someone went to Google and saw that the starts was this .
That means we have a cultural impact over to the scientific impact .
About a week later , there was a problem with the car , just to these flaps here -- these files .
These files are 13,000 legs when the car works at the massive power of the power of the massive .
Now , technique of you will look at the river and say , " It 's not true . They 're fixed too too hard . "
And they can do it because when they 're very coxed by becomes the super---fle-up by--ager files .
So , less 271 degrees , at least 271 degrees , in the winferior the space of the stars , these files can bring that current .
In one of the juntures of the most notice in the LHC , there was a defect of fit .
So the files get to the file , and 13,000 points suddenly met a electrical resistance .
This was the result .
Now , this is more impressive if you think that these magnets fish more than 20 tons , and that you 've been moved about 30 centimeters .
They were damaged about 50 magnets .
We had to take them , what we did .
We rested them and upset .
Now they 're going back all the sub-sidies .
By the end of the mark is going to be integrated .
We 're going to access it , and we expect it to get the data or blind data , and continuing so our adventure to discover what are the morning that are the universe .
Now , of course , in a certain way , these crashes , they reaccend the debate on the value of science and engineering in front of the front of the front of the frontier of the face of the face of the science and the future .
I think the fact that it 's so difficult , the fact of going over the limitations , I think this is the value of things like LHC .
I want to end with the words of a English scientist , Humphrey Davy , which , I think , in defense of unuseful experiments of his pupille , his pupille was Michael Faraday , said , " Nist so much dangerous for progress of human mind how the rups are definitely definitor for the human mind as the rent that our trionfers are definitely defined ,
Thank you .
I want to start asking you to rethink of when , children , you play cococococococococooed .
As you understand how to get them to reach and grab them , take them and move , you learn them and to be able to actually think and solve problems and by manipulating space relationship .
The space reasoning is deeply connected to the way we understand a lot of the world around us .
So , from the information useful , from the useful physical objects , together to my physical objects , together to my collaborator , and my collaborator Jeevan Kalanii , I started asking me , " And if , when we use a computer , instead of having the only as a little digital willt , we could grab , we could grab focus on a desktop , we could grab focus on a desktop of the information with your hands ,
and how do it to our please ?
The question was so interesting that we decided to explore the answer , building Siftable .
In a few words , a Siftable computer is a great interactive computer as a bioday .
In a few words , a Siftable computer is a great interactive computer as a bioday .
You can move them with the hand , they can see them , they can see their movement and they have a screen and a wireless and a wireless wireless .
But most importantly , they are physical objects like the morning , you can just take it into a grandull .
The Siftable is the example of a new ecosystem of tools to manipulate the digital information .
And as they become more physical , consciousness of the movement , other , as they become more physical , consciousness of the movement , of how we move them , we can explore new and fun and fun and fun and fun and fun and fun and fun of interaction .
I 'm going to start with some simple example .
This Siftable is configured to show the video : if you in a direction , video it will rotable , video it will be like this , if you go back to the other side .
These interactive rats are aware of the other .
If you face them , they 're interested in what they 're around .
If they come around , they can see it and they can act a little bit .
If they come around , they can see it and they can act a little bit .
They also greater their movement and inclination .
We then realized that one of the implications of the interaction was to be able to use managed management , for example , to pay a color like it was a liquid .
In this case , we have three Siftable as a bucks of vernice and I can use them to be a versation of color in that central , where they mix .
And I can use them to be brought in the center , where they mischieve .
We 're going to put it up a little place .
There 's also beautiful possibility of learning , like language , like language , mathematics and logic games where people can try to prove things fast , and see the results of the immediately .
I 'm --
This is a Fibonaccount sequence I make with a program of equations .
Here we have a words of the words that 's half between Scarabeo and Boble .
Pratically , at every turnal you have a letter at every Siftable , Pratically , to every Siftable , a letter in case of every Siflick , and as you look at the words of him .
Then , after about 30 seconds remissed , and you have a new set of reading and new possibilities to try .
Thank you .
Here we have children came to the Media Lab , I did it so I tried them and I went up a video .
They have a lot of them .
And one of the interesting things like this kind of applied is that you don 't have to give people a lot of instructions .
You 've just say , " Compons of words , and they know exactly what to do .
Here 's what some of the people try .
This is our youngest tester header header , there on the right .
It 's actually wanted to stop them .
They just were moroncear moroncles , for him .
Now , this is a appliation of a interactive cardddry .
We wanted to build a tool for the learning of the Lui language is Felix .
It can put new characters in the scene , by lifting the Siftable to them .
It can put new characters in the scene , by lifting the Siftable to them .
So , he 's doing it out the sun .
Video : The sun is smile .
David Merrill : Now it 's got a treat the scene .
Video : The treat arange .
Bel work ! Yeah !
So , you get the Siftable and put close to it can make the characters --
Video : Bau !
-- by inventing his story .
Video : Hi !
DM : It 's a story with the open final , and it can decide him .
DM : It 's a story with the open final , and it can decide him .
Video : From .
DM : The last example I have time to show you is a tool , it 's a recently , to trick and executive music .
It 's a tool , made of recent , to the campioneguing and to executiutive music .
The Siftable here , the Siftable here , the bass and the battery .
Each of these has four different variations , and you can choose to use .
And you can also put these sounds in a sequence to behind your please .
And just to move it by doing a sound and a sequence .
These are actually actually you can control from the alive , like reverber and filter .
The attacks to a particular particular sound and then fixed to fix it .
And then there are the general effects as time and volume , that they applied the entire sequence .
Let 's look at how it works .
Video : We 're going to start with a two-Siftable sequence , we 're going to be a series , we put it in a series , we add to the other basic .
Now I put a bass line .
Video : Now , I add of the sense --
Video : And now I 'll put the filter to the bacteria , so I can control the effect from the face .
Video : I can be able to be able to get the whole sequence , by the way or the other .
Video : And now I 'll add the filter to give the bass to give more expression .
Video : I can recombine the sequence to the sequence to flight .
So I don 't have to plan it before , but I can improviate , making it longer or a short .
And now , finally , I can spring the whole sequence by the way to the Siftable .
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is to build new mountain machine interfaces as our brain and more soembles how our brain work and body .
And today , I had time to show you one of the result of this path , and some possibility that we try to bring out of the lab .
The concept I want to transmit is that 's coming up this new generation of designed to interact with digital media , which will bring information in our world in the way we want .
Thank you very much .
I don 't see the now to talk to you with all of you .
I 'm a writer .
I 'm going to cross that 's my profession , but it 's more than this , obviously .
It 's also love and love the nice of my life .
And I don 't expect that it can change .
But , said , something particular happened to my life and in my career , and in my career , who took me to recalibrate the whole relationship with this job .
The particular thing is that I recently written this book , this whose brought , " Mangia , " Ama , " The thing , diversly from my previous books , for some reason why they came out in the world and became a big , bestseller , interational ,
And the result is that everywhere , people treat me as if I were convicted .
It 's true -- convictim , convicted !
They 're all worried to me and they say , " You don 't care of you can 't do any more than I do ?
Do you don 't care about to keep your whole life without being able to create a book that can importance to someone ? "
What can you care about someone ? "
It 's certainly , you know .
But it could go worse , part of the one I remember that over 20 years ago , when I began to say -- I was a writer -- I wanted to be a writer .
I was going to inward the reaction based on the fear .
And people said , " Don 't I could not be able to succeeds ?
Do you don 't have you fear that the umilliation of killed you ?
Do you don 't care about the whole life without anything else to get out and dying on a life without any one to get out of a bunch of dreaming with the blind of failure to the blind of failure ? "
So , you know .
The answer -- the short answer to all these questions is , " Yes . "
Yeah , I 'm afraid of all those things .
I 've always had fear .
And I also fear of many other things that people can 't inguess .
As the food and the other share and other share things .
But , as it was about the write what I thought and I 'd ask me , and I would say that , and I was why ?
Is it rational ?
It 's logical that anyone has to wait to be spented by a job that I was born to do .
But what is this particular in the impressive , in the creative health , it 's about the mental health of the other people in a way that other carrier don 't do ?
How father , for example , he was a chemist engineer and I don 't remember one time in his 40 years of activity that was asked if he had fear to be a capita ?
There was never -- that block of the John engineer John , how do it ?
Don 't work like that , do you see ?
Onestly , chemicals like group don 't have certainly , in the centuries , guadagned the reputation of being alcolied maniaced .
We have enough writers , we have enough reputation , not just the writers , but creative of all kinds of things , we have this reputation of being enormously .
And it 's not to look at the sad of the deaths of the deaths of creative magnifments that , just in the 21st century , just died young people .
And even the ones that you don 't suicide from their dundings .
Norman Mailer , before I died , in the last interview said , " Every , my book killed me a little more more " an extraordinary deal of his life .
But we don 't beat the bat when we feel that that , because we 've actually heard these things so long that in some way we have completely interiorized and accepted the notion that creativity and suffering are some way to the angod .
And the question I want to take to everybody here today is : are you agree with this idea ?
And it 's good you -- because even watching it from a centimeter of distance to me , it 's not good for this supposition .
I think it 's hated .
And I think it 's dangerous and I don 't want to see the perpetuated in the next century .
I think it 's better encouraging our big creative minds .
And I certainly know that , in my case -- in my situation -- it would be very dangerous to start fuse the dark of suppointed , substances of the circumstances that are in my career .
It 's pretty -- you look at it , it 's pretty young , I have about 40 years .
I still have about four work decades .
And it 's likely that whatever I write about now is going to be judged by the world like the work that came out after the world as a time success of my last book .
I 'm going to be slaughter because we are all more like this -- is likely that my great succeeds to my behind is .
Oh , Gesus , who thought !
You know this is the kind of thought that leads a person to start to start drink a ches in the morning and I don 't want to do it .
I would keep doing this work that we love .
So , the question becomes , how ?
And so I think , after a lot of reflections , that the way to work to keep write is to create a psychological psychological construction , OK ?
I have to find a safety dish distance between me , that I 'm writing , and my natural anxial , which is going to write up , and I was trying to get it . And , as I was trying to see if they could have some better ideas and more healthy , to see if they could have some better ideas and more healthy healthy ideas , and more healthy healthy healthy , and I 'm going to see if they could have some of the best and more healthy ideas .
about how to help people create creative residents to manage the emotional risks of creative rests .
And that research took me to the Great and ancient Rome .
I 'm going to go back to the circle and then back .
In the ancient Grek and ancient Rome -- people didn 't seem to believe that creativity selity self-self-self-solid , OK ?
He thought creativity was this spirit watch was this rehealthy , and that they come to the men from some of a distant source and unknown , for distant reasons .
The Greus were called these spiriters of the creativity of creativity " demon . "
Socrate , wonderful , it was believed to have a land-elareas as as a far away .
The Roomes were the idea , but they call that the spirit of spirit .
That 's great , because Roomands didn 't think that a genius was somebody particularly intelligent .
They thought that a genius was this kind of divine that had literally been living in the walls of an artist 's study , a little bit like the elpho Dobby , and that they were out to assistance the job of the artist and models the result of the artist and models the result of that ,
Extional -- here 's the distance of which I talk about -- that psychological construction that you protecting from your job .
And everybody knew that it was how it worked , right ?
So the artists were protected by certain things , as a kind of thing , like the too much too much black , right ?
If your work was exceptional you couldn 't take all the place , you could all know that you were helped by this incorporate genius .
If your job failure , it wasn 't your whole , you know , you know ,
Everybody knew that it was your genius to be a inable .
And so people han conceived creativity in the West for a long time .
Then the Renaissent came and everything changed , and it was born this great idea ; we put the human center of the universe over the center of the universe over the the writing writing writing of the writing writing .
This was the rational principle of humanity and people began to think of creativity selity self-completely from the hydwide of the rational isse .
And for the first time in history , you start to refer to this or that artist as a genius , as a genius of genius .
And I have to tell you , I think it was a big error .
I think I allow someone , a simple person to believe that that you can be like a recipient as a recipient , the source and the source of all the mysteries , creativative and and inknowable and an ethern in the fragile .
It 's like to ask someone to enjoy the sun .
Deform and distors the ego and creates all these inexhibition on performance .
And I think it was this pressure that I was about 500 years old .
And , if this is true , and I think that it 's , the question becomes , and now ?
Can we do it .
Maybe you can go back to a more ancient understanding of the relationship between human and creative mystery creative .
Or maybe not .
Maybe we can 't cell 500 years of rational thinking in a 18 minutes .
And there 's probably people in the audience that would have a legitimate suspects on the news , you know , they follow the next people , they follow the next people in their projects .
And I 'm not going to convince you all about this thing .
But the question I 'd like to ask is -- why don 't no ?
Why don 't it think of this way ?
Because it has more sense of everything that I 've ever heard about to explain the exabove the exasperant process of creative process .
A process that , as anyone who ever tried to do something -- so , all here -- you 're not really doing something -- so , you don 't get rationally .
And , in fact , it can sometimes seem completely like paranormal .
I did this meeting with the recently Ruth Stone , who has now 90 years old , but he was a poetry for all life and told me that during his childhood in the rural . He was working outside the Syginia , working outside the camps , and he felt it , when a poem came from , when a poem was a poetry .
He said it was like a fragorous train of air .
And he came to rotoling toward her from the landscape .
He felt it , because he was going to take the land under his feet .
He knew I had one thing to do that , and it was of her , words , " running like a match . "
And so it 's going to go home and it was to the way to this poem , and it wouldn 't have to take a piece of paper and a pretty quickly , and a matit 's pretty quickly from , as the trappreciate and focus on the page .
Sometimes you couldn 't be enough to be fast , so correcrecve and correcves without able to get to home and the rotolar the rotolar , and she would keep it through and she would keep rotolar through the landscape , and she searching , as she said , " another poet . "
Then there were those times -- this piece of a piece , I 'm never going to forget -- there were moments when it was losing , OK ?
So , he was running home and he was trying to look at the paper and she was looking at the time , and she was going to go through , and then he said , which was like you get to the other hand and then she was going to go .
He cutting the poem from the tail and remain it in his body and he was going to turn the page .
And in these cases , the poem would be presented on the perfect page and the contrary , by the last word at the first .
So when I heard it -- it 's crazy , it 's exactly the same as my creative process .
Not all my creative process -- I 'm not a conviction .
I 'm a mulo , and my way to work is ; you get up to wake up and to play and go over the goffly every day and to play and go over the goffly .
But even I , in my head-shelf , I striped against that thing , sometimes .
And I think that many of you the han made .
You know , even if the work and ideas came up with me from a certain source you can 't honestly safe .
And what is this thing ?
And how can we relate it in a way that we don 't lose your head , but , rather , what do we take a healthy ?
As I 'm about , the best example , the best example I have is the musicist Tom Waits , which I interviewed sewhere different I interviewed different years ago for a newspaper .
We were talking about this , and you know , Tom , for the majorside of life is the incarnation of the incarnation of the artist , trying to control , to dominating these species of the impulses .
But then he got invectual , and one day , and one day he was driving on a highway to Los Angeles , he changed everything for him .
He was going to fast , and all of a tracact sent this little bit of melody , coming in in in his head as the inspiration , and the elusive , and the desider , and the wants , and the desider , but it 's not , but you know how to take it .
It 's not a piece of paper , it doesn 't have a matt , it 's not a matt registrator .
So it starts to hear this species of old old , and he 's going to be able to losing , and I 'm going to take it up and remarrage from this song , and it 's perever .
I 'm not good enough and I can 't do it . "
And instead of going to go into the panic , he stopped .
He 's going to be mentioned , and he did something completely new .
He just just just the sky and said , " Scause , I 'm driving , I 'm driving a ? "
" Do you think it can write a song now ? "
If you really want to extra , you go back at a moment , you can take me me for you .
Other of the time , you go to importunate somebody else today .
You 're going to disturbing Leonard Cohen . "
And his work changed after this .
Not the job , the job was still dark as a time .
But the process , and the heavy anxiety was released when the genius , the genius that he was remained by the other than the problems and the blind , and he was going to get it back from where , realizing that he didn 't have to be a interior thing .
but you can 't do this peculiar , wonderful bizarre collaboration between Tom and this strange and external and this external , and it was not Tom .
So , how I felt that story started to change a little bit even the way I was working and I was always saving me .
This idea , I was saving , " Mangia , Prega , " and " Ama , " and fall in one of those cave disperation where we 're on all working on something and we don 't , and you start to start thinking that 's going to be a disaster , which is going to be the worse book .
Not just bad , just the worst book written .
And I began to think of therefore this project .
But then I got Tom who talked about the air and I tried .
So I stand up my face on the skills and destroy my commments to a vacuum of the room .
And I said , " Holy , what , you both know , what , you 're going to do we know that if this book is not going to be brilliant , no ?
Because I 'm putting all over what I have , I don 't have this .
So if you want to be better , you have to present you and do your side .
OK . But if you don 't do it , you know what , I don 't do it .
I 'm going to write the same because it 's my job .
And I want to do for me that I today today to do my part of this , " Why -- at the end is so , OK -- -- -- in the end , OK -- --
And they were always magnify , because the ballers were professionals and they were great .
But every so much , rarely , something happened , and one of these artists becomes to transcending reality .
And I know you know what I talk , because I know you all saw it , at a point , a performance so .
It was like time stopped , and the dancing walked through a kind of landed , and it wasn 't a different bit of the solite , like 1,000 notes before , but everything .
And suddenly , not just appeared as a human .
But it turns out from the divinity , and it 's lit in the devinity .
And when this happened , the time , the people knew what was , they called it .
They had their hands and start to start to start to get , " Allah , Allah , God , " God , " God , "
That 's God , you know .
Curious note -- when the Morororic Mororders invaded , this habits with them and the ready to change in the centuries from " Allah , Allah , " to " Ole , " the Ole , " the " , " which you can still hear in the corries or in flamp .
In Spain , when a artist did something impossible and magic , " Allah , , " Allah , " , " Alah , " " " " " " " " " " To " -- a God 's flip -- a God .
And it 's great because we need .
But , the problem comes up the day after , for the dancing itself , when you wake up and discover that are 11 a.m. in Martedday morning and the last last of God .
It 's just a mortal with a bad bad to the kinoks , and maybe you can 't ever get to get that altitude .
And maybe nobody will you get the name of God 's still going to go , and what does with the rest of his life ?
It 's hard .
This is one of the most painful recognized painful life .
But perhaps it doesn 't have to be so much force if you can 't believe , in fact , as many extraordinary things than your being come from yourself .
But you would just believe that you 're being a re-imaginable data of this team of a indeed of your life that you have to go to someone else when you finished .
And , you know , if we think it all changes .
And so I started thinking about it , and it 's certainly how I thought I 'm going to put it in a number of months during the work of the book that I 'm going to give it , the dangerous , attesissim followed my my great success .
And what I have to keep me when I feel electiated by this is , not to take care .
It 's not just your job . It 's just your job .
It 's presenting to your side side , any can be .
If your job is dancing , bat .
If the divine , the damn one assigned decide to leave some kind of wonderful , for a moment through your effort , then " Ole through your effort , then " Ole . "
Turns your dance .
And " Ole ! " to you yourself .
I think and I should teach it .
" Ole ! " to you you , just for the human human testing and heada-testing tale of making you continually present .
Thank you .
Thank you .
June Cohen : Ole !
As you know I 've talked about some of these projects on the human genome , what it can mean and new new new set of genes .
We 're now starting a new path : we started to digitize biology and now we started to digital code , we 're entering and now by that digital code we 're entering and synthesize life .
We always tried to ask a big questions .
" What is life ? " It 's something that many biologists believe that they tried to understand vary levels .
We tried different approaches , reduced it to the minimum minimity .
We 're digitizing from almost 20 years from now .
When we sequenced the human genome was to spend from the analome of the computer world 's biology .
Now we ask us : can regenerate life , or create new life from this digital universe ?
This is the map of a little organism , Mycoplasma genitalium , which is the smallest genome , which is the smallest genome of the lab .
And we tried to reduce the genome to create one more .
We can get a hundred genes of genes about about 500 that are here .
But when we look at the hour of metabolic map , it 's relatively simple than our .
He said , this is simple .
But when we look at all the genes we can eliminate , one at the time , it 's very unlikely that this can bring a living cells .
So we decided that the only way to progree to be synthesized this chromosome in a way to get some of these fundamental questions .
And so we started the adventure of " Can we synthesize a chromosome ? "
Can the chemistry to get these big molecules that we never have been able to create these big molecules that we never have been able to create before ?
And , in case , we can make a chromosome ?
A chromosome is just a piece of chemical material that 's inert .
The speed we we can digitize the life is growing up to the life is growing up .
Our ability to write the genetic code , rather slowly , but it 's improving .
And our most recent results the landed result .
We started over 15 years ago .
The process we required many passages , starting with a bioethic review before we began to start .
But we found that synthesize DNA is very difficult .
There are tens of thousands of cars in the world that produce small segments of DNA , long 50 letters , long , over 30 to 50 leck leck and is a degenerative process : the longer is , the most mistakes are .
So we had to develop a new method to assembling these fragments and correct the mistakes .
And this was our first attempt , starting from the digital information of the Phi genome of the 19174 .
It 's a little virus that kills .
We 've been designed the fragments , effectuated the correction of the error and got a molecule of about 5,000 lectations .
The interesting part is when we took this piece of chemist chemist , and we put it in bacteria , bacteria have started reading this genetic code and viral particles .
The viral particles have been released by cells , they came back and they destroyed the Excles .
I talked about recent with the oil industry and the oil industry is saying they 're certainly understood this model .
They have more than you .
We think this is a situation where the software can actually actually build the same hardware in a biological system .
But we wanted to do things largest .
We wanted to build the entire chromosome of the bacteria .
They 're over 580 miles lecting letters of genetic code .
So we thought we could build it in the cassets of virus , so we can change the cassets to understand what are the components of a living cells .
The design is crucial , and if we start with digital information in a computer , these must be very accurate .
When we sequenced this genome for the first time in 1995 accuractivity was a mistake for every 10 miles .
We found that , 30 error . If we had that original sequence . If we had that original sequence we never would be able to do it work .
One part of the process is design , it 's about 50 lecking leckers that are overlap with all the other 50 leckers to build subunits to build subunits to build subunits to build subunits to build subunits .
We make unique elements here .
You probably have a bed that we put in the fixed we put in the fixed .
So , think of that , we have a genetic code based on four letters : A , C , C , Gs and T.
Three of those letters put together with about 20 frightening , and there 's a specific order of reading for every frightening .
So we can use the genetic code to write words , frases , thoughts .
What we did at the beginning is to do this .
Some have been delusers from the fact that it wasn 't poem .
We 've been designed these segments for a few to just join them with enzymes .
There are enzymes that repair them and put them .
And we started assembling with parts , starting with segments from five to seven milecture , joining them in a way to form segments of 24 thousand leck and unique to them .
Each every step we produced these segments in abundance so that we can sequence them from a minute that we 're trying to create an extremely robads -- as you 're going to see in a minute .
We 're trying to automatize the process .
So , this seems a tabellon a basket player .
When we get these very long , we get over the more than 100 miles , the low-lower mile , they will not grow more directly in the Eccles .
It 's the modern of the modern tools of molecular biology .
So we 've seen other mechanisms .
We knew about another mechanism called recombination omologa , which in biology is to repair DNA to repair the segments .
Here 's an example .
This organism , called Deinococcus radiodurans , can absorb three million radiation .
You can see in the upper superior as his chromosome as his chromosome .
In 12 -- 24 hours , 24 hours , it 's replacplaced exactly as it was before .
There are thousands of organisms that they can do it .
These organisms can sit completely .
They can live under empty .
They are absolutely certain life existing in space , and you feel to find new rich environments of water .
ASA showed it that this is .
This is a picture of molecule that we built using these processes , just using these processes , just using the yeast design segments .
The yeast assemble .
This picture is not taken with a microscope electronic microscope , but with a microscope .
It 's a molecule that we can see it with a light microscope .
These are pictures that cover a period of about six seconds .
This is the publishing we did a little time ago .
They 're over 580,000 letters of genetic code .
It 's the largest molecule of a defined structure .
It has a 300 million molecular weight .
If you stamp it with a 10 without spaces , it would like 142 pages , it would take 142 pages to transcscratch this genetic code .
Now , how do we do it work ? How can we attract it ?
Of course , a virus is a game from kids .
It 's a little more complicated when you use bacteria .
It 's easier when it 's eukicariote cells like our : you can just extract the nucleus and put another , which is basically the process of cloning .
In the archael bacteria the chromosome is , but we recently demonstrated that we are able to do a little bit complete transplant of a chromosome from one cell to another and to attract it .
We clear a chromosome from a microbial partment .
The two are different as men from the mopes .
We added some gene more in a way that we could decide what to choice for this chromosome .
And then , I 'm skip to kill all the proteins .
And when we put it in the cells was stupendomed -- and you will open our sophisticatoomic graph -- the new chromosome is going into cells .
And we started thinking that we couldn 't go beyond , but we tried to spush us over there .
This is one of the major mechanisms of evolution .
We found that many species have added a second or a chromosome from a third chromosome , adding in a second thousand tracts in a second thousand tracts in a second thousand tracks .
So you think about evolution as a gene at the time that it has not understood a lot of the biology .
They 're like to be a restriction that I 'm going to get the DNA .
The chromosome that was in the cell not possible one .
The cell phone the chromosome that we put it down to the chromosome .
He express it , and it recognized the other as the express as the express , it 's got the cell and the new chromosome .
It became blue because of the genes we put .
And in a short time , all the feature of a species , they went into a species , and it has transformed everything in a new species , based on the new software that we put in in the cells .
All the proteins have changed , membrane have changed , and when we read the genetic code , exactly what we 've been transferred to what we 've transferred .
Now , this might seem to look like genetic alcheeet , but we can altering things in a kind of substantial .
Now , I 've already explained that this is not about genesis -- but to progress from three million years and a half million years of evolution , and I said that maybe we 're probably going to create a new version of Cambrian explosion that maybe we 're going to create new species on this digital process .
Why do that ?
I think it 's obvious enough when we think about our needs .
We 're going to move from six billion and a half billion people in the next 40 years .
Just to give an example : I was born in 1946 .
Now there are three people on the planet for each one existing in 1946 .
We 're having problems now to find food , fresh water and clean , medicine and breeds and blind for six billion and a half billion people .
It 's going to be even more harder to do it for nine billion .
We use more than five billion carbon , more than 30 billion bullet 's barians .
That means a hundred million barians a day .
When we try to find biological processes , or any kind of process to replace them , it 's going to be a huge challenge .
We have to keep the whole emission of CO2 from these materials that goes into the atmosphere .
At day , thank you to the scientific discovery in all over the world , we have a database with about 20 million genes , and I like to think they are the designed components for the future .
The electronics has only a dozen about a dozen of components , and think about how many different things are coming out .
Our limitations are principles of our limitations , and our imagination .
Now we have techniques , because of these rapid metods of rapid synthesization , to create what we call fight genomics .
We can build a big robot that can produce a million chromosome a crumosome a day .
Think of processing these 20 million genes , or to try to get to get the processes to produce eight or drugs , new vaccines , and we can change , thank you to a small team , and create more biology now that in the last 20 years of science .
And it 's just a standard selection .
We can choose to survival , chemical production or chemical production , chemical production of ethc vaccines .
This is an instanteny-software software programming that we 're working to be able to sit for the computers .
Well , we don 't necessarily know how it will be .
We know exactly what their genetic code .
We 're four-generation , we 're fourth fuel .
You 've seen that you can extract ethanol from the grant , it was a final finished experiment .
We have a lot of second and third generation that will be going to be used by the higher carbons that are going to be used to be higher valuable than the eight different kinds of butanol .
But the only way biology can have a great impact without increasing more than the cost of food and limitaren 't the cost of food and limitarne the dispitaring of food , we 're working on to design cells that we have to reach this purpose , and we think we can have the first fuel of quarters in about 18 months .
The solar solar light with CO2 is a metodo-- but in our discovery different metods .
This is a organism we described in 1996 .
He sves in the deep ocean , about 2,500 meters of the depth of the water .
They create meter from CO2 using hydrogen molecular as a source of energy .
We 're trying to figure out if we can take CO2 , which can easily be transported through your tubs , converting that CO2 in carbon , to drive this process .
So , we think we could be able to be able to increase what the basic question of " what 's life " which is " We , " What 's life " We , " we have the goal to replace the oil industry .
Exactly . If you can 't do that from TED , where you can ?
It would be a main source of energy .
And also , we 're working to use the same metods to create instanticy vaccines .
You saw this year with flu , we 're always back to a year and with a dollar , when it 's to find the right vaccine .
I think that this can change by building vaccines in ancient advaccines .
So , this is how the future could start seem changing , the evolution of evolution , now , accelerating evolution with synthetic bacteria , and infinite cells .
We 're so much from improving people .
Our purpose is to do it in a long way to live a long time . Thank you very much .
First of all I 'm going to show you , the fastest possible , some fundamental work , the new technology we took a way to a quick quisition almost a year ago . This is Seadragon .
It 's an environment where you can interact is to the local level that remote with a huge amount of data .
We 're seeing a lot of gigabyte of digital phoom with a kind of a kind of a kind of a pitch-up , and a leavoring fast , willing the images as we want .
And it doesn 't matter how much it is the amount of information we see , how big these things are these things that are great , or images .
Most are common photographs , but this is a scanning scanning from the Congress of Congress , and it turns out in the range of 300 megapixel .
It doesn 't make any difference because the only thing that the prestactions of a system like this is the number of pixel on your screen in your screen in any time . It 's also a very flexible architecture .
This is a book , an example of data not images .
This is the Dickena desolate . Each colonn-chapter chapter .
To show you that it 's just about it , and not images , we can do something like that , to actually actually , to actually see that it 's a real representation of the texture of the texture .
It could be a little artificial way to read an electronic book .
Not the advice .
This is a more realistic example . It 's a number of The Guardian .
Every picture is the beginning of a sexiety .
And it gives you the pleasure and the beautiful experience of reading the version of reading version of a day magazine , which is for a moltext-to-the-like moltext-to-.
We also did something with the corner of this particular number of The The The Guardian .
We 've created a higher advertising ads -- much higher than what you use in a normal published -- and we put an extra published -- and we put extra content .
If you want to see the characteristics of this automobile , you can see here .
Or other models , or even the techniques .
And this really shows some of these ideas to eliminate the limits of space on the screen .
We hope that this means to put it up to a little bit of other porcheries , and other similar , you don 't have to be necessary .
Of course , the map is one of the most obvious applications for this kind of technology .
And on this is not going to lose time , if we don 't say we have contribute to give them in this field .
These are all the streets in the United States of the United States , over a NASA geospace .
So , we 're going to go to something else .
This now is actually the alive on the Web ; you can go to see .
It 's a project called Photosynth , which combine two different technologies .
One is Seadragon and the other is a search for Noah Snavely , a student of the University of Washington , with Steve Snitz 's aid Sninki Szeitz 's UW Szeliski Rick Szi . Agi collaboration .
And it 's from the face of the Web , managon from Seadragon .
You can see that when we do this type of screens , where we can spend from one image to the other and have this kind of experience .
But the space collocation of the images here has actually a meaning .
The algorithms of computers have recorded these images together , so that correspond to refect places where they have refect .
I don 't know if I have time to show you some other environment .
There are a few more space .
I want to move directly to one of the original Noah-- and this is coming from a previous prototype of Photosynth that we did the first time last summer last .
We had to worry about legal aspects and so on .
This is a re-building re-flap of Notre Dame images in Flickr Basta digitor . Bast Notre Dame in Flickr and you get pictures of the areas and away . Ognone of these conants arange argument is a picture that it has discovered to this model .
So they 're all images from Flickr and they 've all been connected to this way .
And it 's possible to navigate this very very simple way .
You know , I would never think of end up to work for Microsoft .
It 's very gratifying receiving this kind of acail here .
I think you can see that it 's a lot of different kinds of footos : from those of the cell phone .
And if I can , I try to try to look at those strange .
Many of them are faces by faces , etc .
Somewhere you find a series of photographs -- here 's a series of photographs -- here .
This is a Notre of Notre Dame recorded correctly .
We can go from the poster to the physics of this environment .
The essential point is we can do things with social environment . This now is taking data from protectively -- from collective memory of collective memory of how to apply the land , from visual point of view -- and connects those data .
All those pictures become connected together , more than the sum of the parts .
You have a model of the Earth 's interest that emerge .
Think about this as a prolungment of Stephen Lawler on Earth .
It 's something that grows in complexity as people use it , and the advantages for those to use the use it .
Their pictures are husbed with inseries .
If you get some of the idea of contrassigning all these sorts of say , my picture of Nototre Do suddenly is a required to be a requires of all those data , and I can use it as a point of a place , using the picture of a place , using the photography of the chers-to-up experience , and a red cross-to-shelf experience .
Of course , a consequence of this is extremely virtual models of all the interesting part of the land , and the collective revolts , not just from alive and achieved images and similar images and similar images and similar images and similar images and similar images .
Thank you .
Chris Anderson : I realized ? What your software is going to take us to do is that , at some point , in the next few years , all of photographs share everyone in the entire world will be practically connected with ?
BBAA : Yeah . What 's doing in practice is to discover .
He 's creating hyperlinks , if you want to , in images .
And it 's doing it in the content of the images .
The thing becomes very interesting if you think about the semantement information that many of these images .
As you do a research research on the web , you have a sentence and the texture on the website page has a lot of information about pictures .
Now , if that pictures you connects all your pictures ?
So the amount of semantic interconnection and the amount of receptical interconnection is to it is really enormous . It 's a classic effect of the network .
Blaise : Blaise , it 's really incredible . Compeat .
BBAA : Thank you very much .
One of the main pleasure , when you travel and one of the ethnographics of the ethnographics is the living between who has forgotten , you have an antials , you have the past the wind , the toxes in the stones , the flag it in the plants .
Bastes think that the sciamani Jaguar travel again , and that the Milky Way , or the monititites of the elderly Inuit , or Himalayas , the buddists still , the buddists still , the buddists still , but to remind the central importance of anthropology , and that the idea that the central importance of anthropology , and that the idea that the world we live in which we live in .
the consequence of a particular adaptations that our adaptations that our stones did , well , many generations ago .
And , of course , we all share the essential tracts .
We all go . Everybody procreating .
We are subjects the initiation .
We have to deal with the inexorability of death , so we don 't surprising if we 're going to take a little bit of --
We all have an art .
What it 's the particular rhythm of the song , the rhythm of every culture .
It doesn 't matter that are the Penan forests of Borneo , or the follow Vodoo 's the Kenya , or the Kenya Specentt in Kenya Sesut in Kenya , or a campaigning in the Sahara .
He was my journey in the desert a month ago , or a yak food in yak yak in yak Qomolangles , the world 's deaths .
All of these populations teaching us that there are other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , other ways of moving in the world .
And if you take a moment , you think it 's a concept that it can give you hope .
And together , together , we have a nice of the world create a spiritual life and cultural and cultural life that is important for the well-being of the planet and is important as a nice .
And you can think of this cultural rague as an ethnosphere and you can call the thnosphere and you can call the thnosphere , all , dreams , ideas , intuitions , intuitions , ideas , intuitions , intuitions , being from the imagination of human consciousness .
The nine is the fantastic ethnosphere is human disease .
It 's the symbbobox of what we are and what we can be as inquisitive .
And because it was so graved to be a lot of lovely as it 's happened to ethnosphere and unfortunately much faster .
No biological , for example , would say that 50 percent of all species is in the species is or the orders just because it 's fake , or -- in the more apocalypotesthesis -- in biological field of biological diversity -- and you don 't even even even close to the optimistic issue of cultural diversity .
The index of this is , of course , language loss .
When you were born 6,000 languages on this planet .
One language is not just a language of a vocabulary or a series of free rules .
One language is the sprayed of human spirit .
It 's the middle of which the animal of every culture comes in the material world .
Every language is a forest , a bacin the mind , a kin , a kin thought , a kin ecosystem possibility .
And of those 6,000 languages , as we are here in Monterey , at least half the half of the time is not ssurrate in the ears of the children .
They 're no more teach kids , which means , unless you shouldn 't shouldn 't share something that are already died .
What is there more sad than being had a silence , of being the last speech , of being the last speaking a language , the wisdom of the wisdom of the wisdom of the saving of the children ?
This is a pherd of someone in the world in some of the world every two weeks : every two weeks a old muor and door with itself in the tomble syllabe language .
And I know some some of you will say , " Don 't it that ?
The world wouldn 't be a better place if you talk about all the same language ? " Benissim , then we talk all talk about yoruba . And we talk about the dot-hand place .
We talk about kogi .
You 're going to take a tractor of what it means we can 't talk about your own language .
And I 'd like to give you a journey through the nine --
a little journey in the ethnosphere to give you a mess of what we are losing .
Many of us forget that when I say " different ways to say , " " I mean , " different ways of exists . "
We take for example this Barasana Barasana , in the Secectentrional Amazonda , creates the myth of provire , creates the myth of the latest in the pants of sacred sacred sacred sacred sacred sacred sacred sacred sacred sacred .
It 's a popular people who can 't be able to distinguish color from the green green because you 're identified in the forest , which depends on the forest , which depends the popular .
They have a strange language and a marriage of a major a reboard , you have to marriage a different person who talks about a different language .
All of this has radical in the past mitological , yet the particularity is that in these existed families , in these existed families , in which they 're or seven language , no one language .
They 're limitate to listen and then they start to talk .
We take one of the most interesting tribes I lived , the Waorani of Ecuador norter , an incredible popular people who had the first contact in 1958 .
In 1957 five missionaries have tried a construct by by by by by by by a fatal mistake .
They did the photographs that they rereturn them into the photographs that they would think they were going to be lowing up , forest that this popular forest had never seen anything bi-dimensional .
They collected the pictures from the earth , they spread a shape or a shape and , not finding anything , they finding anything , they would concluded that it , and killed the five missionaries with the lance .
But Waorani not just killing the foreign .
They kill them in them .
54 percent of the mortality was caused by their same .
We have been going to eight generations and we found two natural death and when we 've been remarkable to know , they had a lot of them was aged , and then they killed it , and then they killed it . And then they killed it the same .
The hunters were able to recognize the animal urine from 40 steps and recognize the species .
In the early ' 80s , it was assigned a very interesting task when my professor of Harvard , if I wanted to go to Haiti to sweet me between society society society secret to the base of Duvalier and Tonton Macodities and Tonton Macoutes and spring of the fast , and impossessing of my fast ,
To give a sense of miraculous , I would have to understand the Vodoun culture , and the Vodoo is not magic .
It 's pretty much about a metapphysics of the world .
Very interesting .
If I asked you to tell me the great religions of the world , what would you say ?
Cristianism , Islam , Buddismo , Ebraism , etc .
A continent is always left out , thinking that sub-Saharan Africa doesn 't have any religious feeds . And instead of yes and the Vodoo , is not the other than the other than the these religious concepts of the schiavism .
What makes the interesting voodoo is the intense report of life and death .
So , you know , they hidden the spirits .
The spirits can be invoced by the Great Acqua , they respond to the rhythm of the dance of the dance of the face of the last thing that for a short moment that for a little bit of active the follow becomes .
So , the vooyers love to say , " You white you go to church about God .
We give us in the temple and we forget God . "
And from the moment you 're marseats , is the spirit that you get to get you , how bad you 're going to hurt ?
So you have these incredible events : follow voodoo in the state of trance , that touch impuntizing , a rather strong demonstration demonstration of the power of the mind when it 's catalyzed in a state of extreme ,
And I lived all the people with which I lived the most extraordinary Kogi of Sierra Nevada Santa Marta , in Santa Marta , in Santa Marta .
And the antic civilization of the anti-civilization that once had on the charaibles of the Colombia in the actor of the Colombia , the people were ritiring on the max-border of charaibic planture .
In a drug continent , this people never been conquisted by Spanish , it never had been conquisted by Spanish .
But now they are governed by a cler-up , but their formation is so extraordinary .
The young people are taken by the families to three or four years , and they live in a buy world , and sitting in a good world and shadows in a world that 's based on the bottom of the ice for 18 years .
Two damn nine years of proposition to reproduce the nine months of the management that transmanagement in the usage of the mother , they 're metaphor in the Grande Mad .
For this time , they 're acculturate to the values of their society , values that predict their prayers and just their prayers , and just their prayers , or to say the ecological balance -- or to say the ecological balance .
At the term of this initiation , they 're suddenly landed out and for the first time in 18 years , they see a dawn . And in that consciousness of the first blood valles , when the sun valles the valles of the beautiful values , everything that have been learned in theory . The first one of the lendor . The prey a step back and says ,
" I mean ? You know how I said .
It 's about you . Now it 's to you protect it . "
They call the major brothers and say that we , the minords , we are the destruction of the world .
This level of intuition is extremely important .
When we think about Ingene populations and the environment invoice Rousseau and the old story of the noble wild , which is a razer concept in his simplicity or perhaps maybe invoice .
The Ingens are not not feelings from the nindebolites .
There 's no space for these things in the malarial palual palus or in the winds of Tibet , but thank you to think about time and rate , they created a mystics of the Earth 's not about concept of the neighbor , but on an intuition of the neighbor , the concept that the Earth can only live is because it 's infused by human consciousness .
What does it mean ?
And that a little guy of Ande who will grow up , and it 's a destroy , which is a destine , is going to be a destiny different human being a deep different human being a depth , and it will be a different report with the mountain , which is going to be a different depth with the mountain rocks to be a scratching a mountain of rocks to be a scavated .
which is the dimadd of a spirit or a mineral cutting is irrelevant .
What 's interesting is the metaphor that debing the relationship between the individual and the natural world .
I grew up in the British forests , credying that the forests were cutting to be cutting .
And that made me a human being different from my friends Kwakiutl who believe that the forests are the Hamkuk 's dise and the blind of paradise and the batch of paradise and the cannibal world , spirits that they 're living at the north of the world , the spiriters that they 're Hamatsa .
If you start to consider that these cultures can create reality , you could start to understand some their sense discovery , you can start to understand some of them .
I 've taken this stage to open up in the nordocccandy .
Mayahuasca , some of you heard about the ayahuasca , the most powerful psychotive of the monthor .
What makes it fascinating the ayahuasca is not the potential of the macological , but its elaboration . It 's made by two elements .
On the side , this liana legnine that makes a series of beta-carboline , harmolines , harmolins , harmolins , harmolines .
Take the only plants is a bluep that up a little bit of a consciousness , but it 's measurement with the leaves of a coffee family , said Psychotridis .
This plant is a powerful lot of tripptamine , very similar to the serotonin , dimethyltamin-5 , methyl-ptamine .
If you ever see Yanomami pulling up to the blood on the nose that they do by a different species , you 're also contaxting methoxydimethoxtamine .
Turing that dust on the nose is a little bit as being disparated by a byleet of blindness , and landing on a sea . [ Reck ] not creates a distorsion . It 's not creates the dissolution of reality .
I was often a lot of my professor , Richard Evan Shultes , the man who has taken the psychc fungi in the ' 30s .
Second my way , you can 't classifly these tripptamines as hallucinated , because if you can 't tell no one of being hallucinated .
It 's possible absolutely just if you assume with other chemicals that you have the MAO .
Now it 's the beautiful : Is that they find in this liana are inhibitors of MAO , the same type necessary to potect tripptamines . The spontaneous question : in a flour of 80,000 species , how do these popular float , how do these popular to find two deards not like this , they make a biopieces of the backwards ?
We use the great eupherror , which can reveal infruit , can reveal infruit .
But if you ask the Indians , they 'll tell us , " The plants will tell us . "
What does it mean ?
This tribes , the Cofan , has 17 varieties of ayahuasca , who are narely in the forest , and that our eyes would get in the forest , and that our eyes would get in the same species .
If you ask them how they will they 're going to tell us , " I thought , " I thought , " I was thinking about it , " I said , " No . "
The solution is : you take the 17 variety in a night and each one will skip in a night and the canterm will be a different .
And you 're not graduate to Harvard , but it 's much more interesting to contact the stones .
Now , [ applausi ] the problem is that even the ones of us who have to heart people are painting them , but in some way , but in some way we reducts to the margins of the real world , and pass over .
In fact , 300 years , 300 years old , it doesn 't remembered to his guerre or technologic innovations , but rather as the thing as the time was where we were stopped and actively accepted , or accepted by the mass of biological diversity and cultural diversity . Now , the problem is not the change .
All cultures through the centuries have been involved in a new dance of life .
And the problem is not technology .
The Indians Sioux when they put up in the Sioux when they put up and fly and they reach as Americans don 't have stopped to be Americans when they put up and calculus .
It 's not the change or technology that threats the integrity of the enosphere . It 's the power .
The hard flight of the domination .
And if you give a look at the world , you 'll find that these are not destinated cultures that these are not destinated to disappeared .
They are living and dynamics and dynamics outside from the existence to forces that go beyonic existence .
I know that you have to disboscring in the Penan --
a popular nomelt of Sarawak , in the Sarest , a popular that liblink in the forest to a generation ago , and now reduced to the servitus and prostitution on the remarkable , where you can see the river of the riverse of the lime that looks away from the lim to the Mar Cinese Meric Cinese , where the blessed Meric Meric Cinese , where you can see the horizonte ,
With the stunning to fill the stones with the subtracted to the forest .
Or , in the case of Yanomami , they 're the disease that are coming with the discovery of the gold .
If we move on on the mountains of Tibet , where I 'm doing a lot of research , you 'll see the hard flight of politics .
As you will know the genocide , the physical extinction of a popular level , it 's a universal level , but the wild , the destruction of a popular popular , not just not just , but to celebrate in certain environments , because it 's a part of the development of the development of the development .
And you can 't understand the Tibet 's suffering from the beginning .
I 've been there , the 6,000 miles from China Western China through the Tibet soul , and the way to Lhasa with a young colleague , but just come to Lhasa , I realized what 's behind the statistics we hear about .
6,000 seements reduced in dust and cenry .
1.2 million people killed by the military of Cultural Revolution .
The father of this guy was ascriticized at Panchen Lama .
That means that it was killed by the time of Chinese invasion .
Her was sweather with Santity during the diaspora that has taken over the popular in Nepal .
Her mother was imprigioned and his colpe was to be rich .
It was brought to hidden in the age of two years from the age of two years from his gonna because it couldn 't have to live without him .
The sister , which did the same , it was put in reducation field .
A day day he had inavailable of a day a cofferigant Mao and , for this transgression , was put forced jobs for seven years .
The Tibet of Tibet can be inherred , but the recently spired the track of the people is tener .
At the end , everything comes back to a choice .
We want to live in the monothic world of monoonia or want to take the pollycles of diversity ?
The great anthropologiet Margaret Mead , before he died that his biggest fear is that , in our way to this frightening view of human imagination , but a day we 're going to see the whole range of human imagination , but a day we 're going to wake up from a sleep , and we 're going to wake up from a sleep , and we 're going to wake up from a sleep ,
And it 's umillions of remembering that our species is 600,000 years .
The Neolitica Rvolution , who gave us the agriculture , that has made us subject the seed of the seed seed , restore the little bit of the shaman with the prosa of of the clero , making the hidarchia specialization , and we talk about 10,000 years ago .
The industrialized world has 300 years old .
The history of this is not suggests that we have the answers to me all the challenge we 're going to have to deal in the millennia to come .
When to these myriades of the world is asked what it means to say to be human , they 're asking 10,000 different voices .
And it 's in these answers that we all have the possibility of being what we are : a kind of a conscious species , it must be a kind of a kind of a kind of optimism .
I 've taken this picture on the northern extremity of Baffin the North island , when I went to the balene with Inuit , and this man , Olaya , Olaya , Olaya , and he told me history of his grandfather .
The canadd government is not always gentile with the Inuit and in the 1950s to stabilish our suprematic , we have to give them them in colonies .
The grandfather of this guy rejected to go .
The family , I teming her life , took them all the time , and all of his attitude .
You have to know that Inuit don 't ffreeze the cold , they use it .
The packs of the slitert were made of heaving fish .
The grandfather of this guy did not intimight from the night or from the library , which was suffering .
It 's sleep , it calculated the pantalone in the skin skin and defecated in your hand . When the flies , the flies , they were working on it .
He spring up on the downtool and when it became solid , and when it became solid , he killed a dog .
It 's got a block , and he made a brighter , with the cass of the town , he created a sleep , and he 's disappeared on the bk , hit a check hell , hell of caccess to the check .
Do we want to talk about cavarself-with nothing ? [ Recate ] . And this , in different ways , [ Applausi is the symble of the Inuit 's popular symbbox and all of the world 's Inuit 's all of the Inuit and all of the world 's Inuit 's .
In the april 1999 , the canadd government redded the total control of an area of the largest territory of California and Texas I put together .
It 's their new patria . It 's called Nunut .
It 's an independent territory . They controlate all the mineraries .
One example of the natione-state of a natione-state can recognize with his people .
And , to finish , I think it 's pretty obvious at least in those remote places of the planet , realizing that they 're not remote .
For someone 's home .
They represent sexuation of human imagination that are going to be rescue . And for all of those children , like the dreams of our children , as the dreams of our children , become part of the nuda geography .
From , we of National Geographic , we convinced that politicians will never get anything .
We believe that the polemids --
[ Applausi ] are not persuasive , but we believe that stories can change the world , and maybe we 're the best institution to tell stories of the world . Each month , our website have 35 million visit visit .
156 countries spit our television channel .
Our rists are thlled by millions of people .
Our work is travel to travel in ethnosphere to bring our audience of wonderful cultural places that go away from the way to the cut of the anthropology , habat will , and they will be able to , and we have to find a cutting style in diversity , and we have to find a a style world and multicultural world , and we have to find a style and multicultural stypes , and multicultural style and and and
where all the people wisdom of all the people can contribututed to our collective well-being .
Thank you .
I 'm going to talk about some things I wrote in this book that I hope I 'm going to recall some other than you 've heard and try to object some connections , in case , you wouldn 't notice them .
I want to start with what I call the " official dogma "
The official dogma of what ?
The official dogma of all the Western industrial society . The official dogma " : " If we want to massive the well-being of our citizens . "
The reason is , from one side , in fact that freedom is itself a value , is predictious , is predictile , essential for human beings .
The other is that if we are free , each one of us can act for all of us to do to do everything that massive our well-being , without no one that decides to be , without any decides of the name .
The way to massive freedom is massive to massive the choice .
The more choices are the more they are free , and more than they are their freedom , more than they are .
This , I think , is so deeply round in society that no one would dream that no one would dreams to put it in doubt .
And it 's also deeply rooted in our lives .
I 'm going to show you some examples of what progress has made possible .
This is my supermarket . It 's not particularly big .
I lose a simple note about conditions for saved .
In my supermarket , there are 175 conditions , without contare 10 varieties of oil oil , the 12 pyly-aththlegs that you can buy you can buy you a number of conditions in the cut circumstance that nobody of one of the 175 ready is your degree .
So , this is how the supermarket .
Then you go to the electronic stereo to buy a stereo : you , CD lector , radio , piahand , the lector .
And in this single electronic store , there 's a great number of audio components .
We can make six million different , a half million different combinations that there are in one store .
You have to admit that there 's a lot of choice .
Other fields : the world of communications .
Once , when I was a child , you could get all the telephone services , at the pat the package that were fornites from mama Bell .
He had the phone , you didn 't buy it .
A consequence of that , another is that the phone never would break .
These days , they went .
Now we have a variety almost illlife , especially between the cell phone .
Here 's the cell phone .
My favorite is the middle , MP3 , blinks of nose , and the force for me , branch for the Belele me .
If you don 't have yet seen it in the store under home , you 're well certain you 're sooning .
And what happens is that people go into the gods and ask this question . And you know , what 's the answer is ? The answer is " No . "
It 's not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn 't do too much .
So , in other life that are much more important than the acquired of the acquired , the same explosion of choice .
Assistence , no more in the United States that you go from the doctor and the doctor and say , " Dr. "
Instead , I go to the doctor , and the doctor says , " OK , we could do . " Or B , " A has these benefits and those labs . What you want to do ? "
You say , " Dotic , what would I have to do ? "
And the doctor says , " A has these benefits and risks , and you have these benefits and risks . "
" What do you want to do ? "
And you rebat : " Dotic tic tic tic tic c if she was me , what would you do ? "
And the doctor : " But I 'm not her . "
The result of the result , we call it " mality " , " it 's like a nice thing .
But actually , it 's not that a move the weight and responsibility to make decisions from someone knows something , which is the doctor , to someone else that doesn 't know -- and so much about anything -- and so much of it -- and so it 's not in the condition to make decisions of the patient .
There 's a huge marketing of drug drug products , direct to people like me and you , that if you think you have no sense , because you can 't buy them .
But if we can 't buy them , why do you public them ?
The answer is that they want to domorning , we call the doctor to ask them to change us the recipe .
So , a fundamental thing as our identity is an orever is a question of choice , as you see in this jypitch , " We don 't want to give children children . " We don 't know the food . " We don 't know more an identity : we have to invent .
And we can reinvented how many times we can do it .
That means that every morning , at the risk , you have to decide that kind of person want to be .
I think it was to the family and marriage , a time the common , which was that it was that it marriage , it was that it marriage , and it was that it was that you marriage the most soon possible .
The only real choice was with you , not when , and even what to do after .
Ose it all is really to play .
I teach very smart students , and I do 20 percent in less than a time .
And it 's not because they 're brilliant , not because they are not so good .
but why are they impensierites , I mean , " Would I marries up now ? "
" Do I have to married me later ? " I have to think before you have to be children or career ? "
They 're interrogatives logorants .
And they try to answer these questions , even if this implacy not complete the companies ass that I assignment and not to get a beautiful vote to my examples .
And they really have to do it . They 're important questions .
Now , the job : we are lucky , like Carl was , because technology allowing us to work every minute , every day , from every corner of the planet , except from Hotel Randolph .
And I think of the parenty-up , and I 'm not going to tell anyone , where the WiFi works .
I don 't tell you , because I want to use it .
What does this mean , this incredible freedom of choice that we have to do about work ? It 's that we have to keep on , and we have to work or not .
We can go to see our son playing hood , with the cell phone in a pocket , Blackberry in the other , and the news , typically , on the grid .
And even though they 're all spent , every minute we see our son finding the game , we 're also asking this , " I have to answer this call ? "
" Did I answer this email ? " I have to get this letter ? "
And even when the answer is " no , " all this makes the experience of your game of very different from what would be in other conditions .
So , from any part of the look at , little , big , materials and large materials and lifestyle , life is a question of choice .
Once the world was this : Ovation , there were some possibility , but it was not a question of choice .
The world of today is going to look like this : The dilemma is : " Is it positive , or negative ? "
The answer is Sorry .
The positive latest lats we all know , so I 'm going to talk about the negative lats .
All this choice compories two negative effects on people .
The first , paradoxically , it 's produced paralycles away .
With the topons between which choice , becomes very difficult to do it .
I give you an example : a conduct an example : a conduct on the volunteer penciplans .
A my connection had access to the Vanguard data , the giant society 's a giant source of pyourself a million clients in 2,000 different companies .
What she turns out that she found is that for every 10 solutions that are offered in more , the percentage of two percent .
With 50 offers sets , there 's 10 percent in less than adhesions than when they are only five .
Because with 50 fourds between those choosing , is , it 's sick difficult to decide , and choice is remaining to remaining tomorrow .
And to ask tomorrow , and again , tomorrow , tomorrow , and of course , and the tomorrow never comes .
You know that it doesn 't mean that these work from the old work from the old work , because they 're not going to have enough money , it also means that decision is so host that they lose the decision is so host that they lose the funds of the job .
Don 't participating , they 're losing until five thousand dollars a year from work , which would be well disposed to versarle them .
So the paralisis is a consequence of the too many choices .
And I think it makes the world like this .
" And to finish , for ethchup , " or " " " " or " " lead " ? "
You would take the right decision , if it 's for ethnithernity , right ?
You don 't want to choose the wrong , and yet , and yet the wrong condition .
So this is the first effect . The second is that we can also avoid paralysis and doing a choice , at the end we are less submitted by the result of how we were with less options .
And this for different reasons .
One of these is that with a lot of conditions , you know , if you buy one and it 's not a perfect , it 's easy to imagine that you would have a different choice , and what happens is that you would be better . And what happens is that the alternative induces us to choice , and the replace as diminustrated by decision , and the replace as diminustrating the soddisfeter ,
even when it was a good decision .
The more choices there are more , the more easy to dislie than any detail that 's insophisting the option of choice .
And also , there 's what economists call to be expensive .
Dan Gilbert has asked a lot of stamattina as the value we give things to the things depends on what we confronted them .
The rest , when there are so many possible options , it 's easy to represent the attractive feaments of alternative , and be less satisfacts of the option that you have choice .
Here 's an example . I 've been schooling with all those that are not New York .
But that 's what you would probably think .
There 's this couple to the Hamptons .
A place of lussian place .
Spiach splendida . Otma . It 's all for them .
Not miss nothing . But what he thinks is , " Well , damage , it 's Agotta . "
" All my neighbors in Manhattan are away . "
" I could talk about your own front of home . "
And it goes two weeks assilled by the idea that 's losing -- every day -- the ability to park where it wants .
The expensive opportunity decrease the satisfaction for what we have , even when choice was excellent .
And the most are the options we have to consider , the more the attractive feature will be going to re-up .
Here 's another example .
This is a little bit of a lot of things .
It 's about living the time , and maybe living living living living living living in the slowly .
But the most important point is that whatever you choice , you get down to them .
The things we don 't choose to take a lot of attractive , that we make less attractive .
Third point : spiral growing of the expectations .
I tried it on my skin buying a new couple of jeans .
I 'm almost always jeans .
Once the jeans were just a guy , buy them and brought besty , they were discovered , just after having them a life and work and work a lot of times , they began to go well .
So I went to buy a couple of a couple when those old were gone , and I said , " I need a couple jeans , this is my cutting . "
The committer said , " Look , " Do you want the slim , the fit ? "
Do you want to do it with the cernist ? " Stonewashed or " " " " or " acidasasure ? "
" Do you want to strate ? "
" Do you want to walk or stretch ? Bilbla blah blah .
I was sbalord , and after a little bit , I could say , " I want to say , " I want to do the guy that was , " He had no idea what it was , so for a time , I tried to all of maledites , and I came out of the best jeans , I had ever been .
It was the massive . With all that choice I had the best .
But I felt out worse .
Why ? I wrote a whole book to understand it .
The reason I was worse to is that with all that choice of my expectations were high , jeans had to be perfect .
I had to do the beginning . I didn 't expect anything exceptional , when it was just a guy , but when it was 100 different kinds of steps , at least one guy had to be perfect .
What I had been buy , but not perfect .
After I had a paragoned that I was to try to get to the expectations .
The adding options in life of people don 't do that increasing the expectations that these have respect to the excellence of the same .
And this produring less satisfaction , even when the results are good .
Nobody in the marketing world , if you realize it .
Because if they knew it , you wouldn 't know what I 'm talking about .
The truth looks like this .
" He was better when it was worse was worse to it , " The reason that was better when it was worse was even worse , and it was even worse to be able to meet some surprised surprised .
Odry , in the world we live -- opulent , citizens with the expectancy of perfeeding -- the massive that we can hope is that things are on the altitude of expectations .
You never have to have ever surprised , because your expectations , my expectations , you have to ingigantic .
The secret of happiness -- what you 're here -- is , " Bassessment " Yes , " Yes , " Yes , you want .
I mean -- small at the car now -- that 's really married and my wife is really wonderful .
I couldn 't do it , I couldn 't do it , I didn 't have any conented .
But it 's not always a bad thing .
Finally , a consequence of buy a couple of jeans when there 's just that jeans is that when you 're not satisfacts , and you ask , " Why ? "
" Who is responsible ? " , the answer is clear .
The world is responsible . What could I do ?
When there are hundreds of the jeans , and you buy a insophister , and you ask who is the responsible , is the responsible , it 's the clear , it 's the responsible you .
You could do better .
And with hundreds of varieties available varieties , there are no six-insuccess .
So when people take decisions decisions , even if the result is the result , they feel like they 're willing and damn the hit to their hit .
In the last years , the depression is exploded in industry ,
I think a meaningful factor -- not the only one , but important -- of this wave of depression is that people have some deludents , because it standard are too high .
And when they have to explain this situation they think that hit 's their own .
So the final result is that we 're in general , objectively , but we feel worse .
So let me remember .
This is the official dogma , what we all take for good and it 's completely fake .
There 's no doubt that a little bit of choice is better than I have no deal with , but it doesn 't take a lot of choice is better than a little bit .
There 's a critical value , magic . I don 't know what it is .
But I 'm sure we 've been going to through a piece of the level where they choices improve our life .
Now , from political point of view -- I almost finished -- from political point , the core is the following .
What allows you all this choice in the industrial society is the material wealth .
There are many places in the world , and you know , you know , where the problem is not that they have too much choice .
The problem is they have too hard .
So the factory I 'm talking about is a malbeing exclusive of modern , Western society , Western Western society .
And what it makes you and climbing is this : Steve Levitt . Steve Levitt has talked about how much much much expensive and discovered ways to the baby of money .
I mean these choices , complicated and available , is not that they 're just inuseful .
I 'm addicted deleteries .
They make us worse .
If a little bit of what in our society is allow , it 's reversed in those where people have too much possibilities , it would not just be their life to improve , but our own life .
This is what economists call a paretian improvement .
A re-distribution redded re-distributtion re-poor -- because of this choice in excess , that we get us .
To conclude : " You can become everything you want to become everything you want to "
You , people of culture , you think , " What does that create that fish ? "
" It 's obvious that you can 't get anything in a blind . "
" A castrategied , a limited vision of the world --
And I interpreted it so , at the beginning .
But then , I think , instead , I realized that that that the fish soup over the long .
Because the reality of the facts is that if you miss in frantum , so that " everything you can 't do . " You get the paralisis .
If you break the box in a way that everything diminuminule is that it 's possible decrease .
You 're going to take the paralysis , and you reduced the well-being .
Everybody needs a sphere .
This is almost certainly too much much , maybe even for the fish , and certainly for us .
But the absence of a few symbolic symbolic symbolicity and , I 'm afraid .
Thank you very much .
