The year I showed these slide death that the glacial calotta glacial calculartics , that 's almost three million years , the size of 48 , the U.S. continental , is a 40 percent .
But it 's a subvalue of the problem because it doesn 't show the problem because it doesn 't show the ice of the ice .
The glacial calotta is , in a certain sense , the heart of the global climate system .
You 've got to inverny and you ritizen .
The next diapositive is going to be a quickly quickly carried to the last 25 years .
The ice aces are designed in red .
And you see , you 're going to be the blue .
That 's the ice in inveral , which you 're ritizen .
You can see that the cosidgn , five years or more , is how blood blood , and here , it 's the body .
And 25 years , it 's past , so .
This is a problem because the reference is the interest to the round of the ocean , where there are enormous amounts of carbon congelated , and they 're saved , and they 're transformed in the microbi .
I 'm going to spect the totality of the inquining atmospspread , that the amount could dancing , super-fied , super-fishing , not around .
And some lagey , a little profound in Alaska metan .
The professored Katey Walter of Alaska team of Alaska team of a team of a blow lago ,
Video : Wow ! Gore : Look . The question is if we 're going to be .
A reason that this is that this environmental replaced the GGroenland from the northern North .
This is a glacial records .
The brought them never reached them .
This is the Kangerlussuaq , in the sound of Groenland .
If you want to know how the sat the sea level of the ice of the ice of the ice , here is where the sea .
These are degreed .
The other part of the planet : Antards , the biggest block of the planet .
The month of the scientists have dichied that the ice of the ice is in negative , and the Antarards , and the Antarards , which is starts on some sun , and it 's particularly quickly , it 's particularly quickly , and it 's particularly quickly quickly , and the Chinese .
Evval , six feet of the acque level of the ackland .
Sull Himalaya , the third block of ice , you see new lags , who were the ice ice ice .
40 percent of the population will revolved with the water . It 's going to be a lot of the water .
Sulle Ande : this ice is the source of the water points of this city .
The reported is aumented .
But when they diminuds , the same accade to water .
In California , the neve on Sierra Nevada is diminuged 40 percent .
The rrich sweight .
The predictions , like you know , they 're good .
The growth of security in the world door to a remarkable remarkable .
The disastern environmenting , they 're increasing a riting rich and without precedent .
Four times more numeroes in the last 30 years than the precedent 75 .
This is a sent of all insustainable .
If you look at the Chric context , if you can see the context .
In the last five years , we added 70 million tonnels in the ocean every 24 hours -- 25 million tonin the ocean every day .
Look at the area of the Pacific area , from the Americans , and in the west , and in the substest parts of the continent , where there 's a radical imor of the the U.S. Indian inner of the ocean .
The major because of global warming , together to the deforestation , which is 20 percent , it 's the use of the combuy .
The oil is a problem , and the carbon is even worst .
The U.S. are one of the two countries with the emissions , together to China .
And it was propond of a lot of the carbon .
But we 're going to have a change or direction .
These are the projects in the last years and some propoor of alternative alternative .
And every way , there 's a political lower in our country .
The carbon of the oil and oil have spent 250 million dollars in the last year to promote the carbon , which is a ossiggggold .
And the picture of something --
I 'm Natal , in the Tenneso , where I live , there was a loss of 3.8 billion likers .
Maybe you saw the news .
This is the second big fussily in America .
It 's happened around Natital .
The publishing of one of the carbon was this .
Video : The Frosty the carbon is a type of allegro and happy .
It 's abundance here in America , and it 's grow our economy .
It 's the carbon is more more than it .
It 's a good price , and they 're working on the price .
Al Gore : The West Virginia .
The bigger society is Massey Comping is Massey Comping . This is his friend .
Video : Don Blankenship : Sarly , Nancy Pelous , Nancy Pelessous -- they don 't know what they 're talking about .
Al Gore : So the Gore : The Protext of Clima has two camppay .
This is a part of them , a part .
Video : Actor : Alla COALergy we see the climate change change .
For this our priority is investment a big amount of money in a sundancing to make public , and it 's the vertising .
In fact , the carbon is not sporite .
We think it 's just a good good , it 's also a good defuel .
So you don 't preocumatic change .
Let me do us .
Video : Actor : Carbone , you 've heard a lot of a lot of talk about .
So I do it a whole structure in a structure in a structure of the town of the carbon .
Straordinary ! The machines are a little rumorous , but this is the sound of the carbon technology .
The consumption of carbon is between the major global warming , but the technology of the cool technology , but the technology of the puzzle that you see all .
You have a look at : this is the odiergn technology .
Al Gore : Inend , the positive , the positive the economic question and the economic security and the security of the economic security .
Video : The America is in the crisis ; the economy , the economy , the climate crisis .
The fix that the connects of all : our dependence of the combuy , like the carbon sporite and oil .
Now , I 'll loved , there 's a new , audace solution to use .
And America : 100 percent of the energy , in 10 years .
A plan to reach America to work , make sure more sure , and help us stop the global warming .
Finally , a solution that we have solution to solution our problems .
And they 're not going to be .
Al Gore : This is the last .
Video : The way , it 's about the energy to America .
One of the most construction of the most construction of the dependence of the comfortable to dependence ,
And it 's the future : The future is here . It 's a new energy energy .
And the U.S. 2 : Nuoves for places of work .
Anyment : Repower . It 's time of being realists .
Al Gore : A old , a African old , " If you want to go to faster , you go from solers .
If you want to go away , you 're going together . "
We have to go away , quickly .
Thank you very much .
Last year at TED , I 've got a introduction on the LHC .
And I promise to travel up to travel out how the car works .
So , I was cool . And the ones that the other time there were no , LHC is the scientific experiment ever ever , the LHC is the scientific experiment , 27 kilometers of the conference .
His the compulate of reach the conditions that were less than a million than a million than a second of the universe -- until 600 million times in the universe -- until 600 million times a second .
All of this is just environmental .
This is the car under Ginevra .
We 've got a bunch of this min-Big Bang in the remarkers .
This is what work . It 's called ATLATLATLATLATLATLoner .
This is a picture of ATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLAS in the construction .
The 10 settember of the last year we acceso the car for the first time .
And this picture was a picture of ATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLAS .
It was because of immense , they 're festeggiving in the health of control .
It 's a picture of the first of particle that had done all the around the LHC , entering in collision , with a part of HC , and a part of HC , and it 's particles within the HC , and it into the race .
In other words , when we see that image the 10 settember , we realized that the machine was , the big vitten .
I don 't know if it was going to do this , when someone went on Google and vide that the page was this .
That means we had a cultural impact cultural impact .
And I 'm a week later , there was a problem with the car , I had to these fix here -- these fix brought here -- these fix shers .
These are fix 13,000 print when the machine works at the massive of powerful powerful .
Now , the technical technique of you look at the fix and say , " It 's not true . They 're very sotackers . "
And instead they can do it because when they 're very cosiddicks .
So , at least 271 degrees , to a temperature in the space between the stars , these pink can bring that the stars .
In one of the giuntures between the most novehicle , there was a defect of the LHC , there was a defect of the faby .
So the fix fix , and the 13,000 hold print , and 13,000 hold hold , meaning a resistence .
This was the result .
Now , this is more impressive if you think these magnetic fish are more than 20 tonnels , and they 've been moved about 30 centimeters .
They 're drusted about 50 magnetic .
We had to have to have them , what we did .
We 've restined and beach .
Now they 're all going to be all in their place .
And I 'm going to be the LHC is going to be a new integrum .
We 're going to access , and we 're expect of the data , and we continue so the lake , and we continue so much that they 're the morning that they 're the morning that the universe .
Now , of course , in a certain way , these incidents reaccended the debate of the value of science and engineering in front of the engineering of the engineering of the engineering .
I think the fact that the fact that it 's so difficult , I think this is the value of things like LHC .
I 'd like to end with the words of a English , Humphrey , the way , in difeny of inuseful , and in difeny , and he said , " Nist Michael Faraday , and he said , " Nist Michael Faraday , and the human human ideas of the mind that are the ideas of the human human beings , and they don 't have a lot of the whole . "
Thank you .
I want to start to ask you to start , when , kids , play cover the morning .
And so you know how to reach them , and you 're going to get them and move , and you 're going to be able to think and solve problems .
The reasoning space is profoundly connected to the way we understand the world around us .
So , from the information of our interaction with the physics of our interaction with objects , together to my consulent Pict , and my consulfire , and my collaborator Kalanithi , and I started to ask me , " And if we 're a computer , and I 'm a computer , but when we 're a computer , you 're a computer , you can be a computer , a little bit of a bunch , with a little bit , with a blink , with a bandandandscreen ,
and sistly it does it ?
The question was so interesting , we decided to explore the answer , and it was built the answer , and it was built .
In a few words , a Siftable computer is a whole computer interactive , like a bidden .
In a few words , a Siftable computer is a whole computer interactive , like a bidden .
And you can move with the hand , they can see them , " You can see the movement and they have a screen and a radio .
But sound , they 're physics , like the morning , and you can start to just reach .
The Siftable is the example of a new ecosystem system to manipulate information .
And he 's hand that they become more physical , conscientists , and other , and and they become more physical , and they become more physical , and the other , of them , and we can explore them to new new and different things .
And I 'm going to start with some expensive .
This Siftable is configurt to show you the video : if you sin a direction , the video rotherwise , the video rich , if you 're sin the other side side .
These riting interactive .
If you 're going to do them , they 're interested in what they 're around .
If they 're circircircircummit and can do a little bit .
If they 're circircircircummit and can do a little bit .
They have the way their movement and inlination .
And then we 've realized that one of the interaction of the interaction of the interaction , to be able to use the data , to the data , to the study , " a liquid .
In this case , we have three Siftable , and I can use them to the color , and I can use them to the color , where you 're mistaining .
and I can use them to the color in the middle , where you mistaining .
If we 're too too , we can get a little bit of place .
I 'm also good to the chance of appricing , and games where the language and games where people can try to be trying to do things quickly , and you see the fast result of the speaking and see the result of the result of the appreciate .
Now I 'm ...
This is a sequence of Fibonacks that I do with a computer programs .
Here we have a game of words that 's going to half a game of Scarabeo and Boble .
Pratically , at every turny , you have a literally , in the case of the Siftable , and you 've got a literally in the case of the Siftable , and while you 're looking at a slide of the words .
And then about 30 seconds , and you have a new bunch and new new chance to try .
Thank you .
So here 's how to the kids came in the Media Lab , I did this in a video .
They have a lot of them .
And one of the things of this kind of application is that not to give you a lot of instruction .
You just say , " Compons of words , " and they 're exactly what do .
Here 's how many people are trying to do .
This is our young tester than the most young , there 's the right right .
He was actually wanted to be improve them .
They just ran an morning , for him .
Now , this is a very application of a whole interactive .
We had to build a tool for the apprendiment of language and Lui is Felix .
It can be able to be new character in the scene , you can get their associated .
It can be able to be new character in the scene , you can get their associated .
Here 's , it 's doing the sun .
Video : The sun is sun .
David Merrill : Now , he took a treators in the scene .
Video : The treators .
Bel work !
So , I 'm going to get the Siftable and put closs can interact the characters --
Video : Bau !
-- inventing your story .
Video : You 're the !
DM : It 's a story with the end , and you decided to him like it .
DM : It 's a story with the end , and you decided to him like it .
Video : Very , gat , throoms .
DM : The last example I have time to show you is a tools , make a tools , to samong , to samage and exesive music .
It 's a tool , I 've been a recent , to camp and exeguing music .
The Siftable here are aging from the bottom and the bacteria .
Each one of these have four different variations , and you can get what you use .
You can also sorting these sound in a sequency sequency to your pleasure .
And it 's just a blink to make a " and a sequence . "
These are actually actually control from the vision , like the reverbed and the filtrum .
The attacks to a particular sound and then inclens to travel .
And then there are the general , as time and volume , which is going to be a whole sequence .
Let 's look at how it works .
Video : We 're going to try to start a board in the Sift-two Siftable , we 're going to add the other board .
Now I put a line line .
Video : Now I add the percepsions --
Video : And now I 'm going to put the bacteria , so I can control the effect from the vision .
Video : I can be able to be able to be the intersequence , a little linking time from a side side or another side .
Video : And now I 'm going to add the filtrum to give more expression .
Video : I 'm going to recombinate the sequence of the sequence . "
So I don 't have to planning before , but I can improved , but I can improved ,
And now , finally , I can spend the intersequence , the whole sequence , Siftable to the left Siftable . "
Thank you .
So , you can see , my passion is build new interfaces like this is to build new new new sexuum , and the body .
And today , I 've had time to show you one of this load , and also some chance that we try to bring out of the lab out of the lab .
The concept I want to put you is that the new generation of objects to interact with the digital media , which will take information with the digital media , which will prove information in our world in the way we want .
Thank you very much .
I don 't see the now of you talk about all of you .
I 'm a wrote .
It 's my profession is my profession , but it 's more than this , of course .
It 's also love and the fashion and the my life .
And I don 't expect that you can change .
But , he said this , something particular happened in my life and my carerly , and my carereralibrate with this work .
The particular thing is I 've been recently written this book , this book called Mang , " Mang , " The Ama , " which was , and I 'm going to be a lot of the books , and it 's a lot of feeling , and it 's very feelational , bestly , and it 's a great feeling ,
And the result is that anybody . So , people are treatred as if you were constructed .
It 's a single -- he 's constructed ,
They 're all from me , I 'm all worried and say , " You don 't have a better than I could do better ?
You don 't have a bit of continue to write for all of life without to create a book that can be able to create a book that can important ? "
that can be important to someone ? "
It 's rassustainable , you know .
But it could go worst , in part , I remember , I remember , when I started to say , the people -- I was a wrote -- I was a wrote .
And I was going to indict the same reaction .
And people said , " Do you don 't have success to be successed ?
You don 't have a million jobs that you kill you kill ?
You have no painted to do this mestious mestious , and they die on a cure , and it 's dead on a custstage of the board with the board , and it 's failed ? "
So , you know .
The answer -- the short answer to all these questions is , " You . "
I 'm paining of all those things .
I 've always had a fear .
And I also have a lot of other things that people could not ininate .
And as the allow and other things spent .
But , how much about the write what I thought and I 'd ask me , and I ask me , it 's why ?
Is it ?
It 's logical that anybody to be spend from a job that you have to be spent from a job that you 've been born for a job that .
But what 's so so particular in the impressive and creative to make us nervous health health health health health health , and each other of the other career .
How my father , he was a engineer , and he was not remembered a chemical engineer in his 40 years of activity in his 40 years of activity , and they had a engineer ?
There was no -- that blowwnice of the engineer John , how ?
It didn 't work , it 's not going to work , it ?
Onestly , the engineers like a group of not certainly , in the seargued , in the several reputation of being alcolized .
We have a scritters , we have this reputation , and not just scritters , but creativity , we have this reputation of a huge instable to be enormous .
And it 's not the other that look at the trists or dead of the dead of the dead creative , in the 2th century , they die and often for them .
And the ones that you don 't have sicians seem to be retrouble from their dones .
And Mailer , before he died , in the last interview , " Our book , " Our book , and he killed a little bit more extraordinary of the work of their life .
But we don 't know , when we feel this , we 've heard these things , because we 've been completely interized and accepted the notion that the notion that creativity and accepted the notion that the art and the art , and the art , and the art , and the art , and it will always always always have to the end .
And the question I want to take all today is : you 're agree with this idea ?
It 's good , it 's why you 're also looking at a centimum of distance .
I think it 's odious .
And I think it 's also dangerous and I don 't want to see the next century .
I think it 's better to be incordate our big minds .
And I 'm sure that , in my case -- in my case -- would be very dangerous starts to the point of the supply , sound , sound , sound , sound , in my career .
Of course -- I 'm very much -- I 'm rather young , I 've been about 40 years .
I 've got about four decades work in me .
And it 's very likely that any thing I 've write to the world as the work that used after I 'm working on my last book .
I 'm going to slavery , because we 're all more or less friends here -- it 's likely that my spent is my my spent .
Oh , Gesus , who thought !
You know this is the kind of thinking that the person who starting to be a person to start to the nove of the morning and I don 't want to do it .
I 'm going to continue to do this work .
So , the question is the question is it , like ?
And so it looks like , after a lot of reflessions , that the way to work to write is what to do a costruction of psychologic psycholder , OK ?
I have to find a distance of security of security between me , and my natural ancy , and my natural ancy , and my natural ancy , and I 'm trying to get it out of the last year models , and I 'm trying to find other society to see if they could have ideas and see if they could have ideas and more sane , and then you 'll find other society to see if they could have ideas and more sane ideas and more sane .
how to help people create creative indeed the inerrisk of creativity .
And that research me , and the Great and the Great and ange .
Seguitees because I 'm giant to me .
Neless Great and the Great and Rome -- people don 't seem to believe that creativity came to men , OK ?
He thought that was the creativity was this spirit , and that they would be the men from men from a few people distant and knowledge , and unknown distant , and unknown .
The green green , they were called the demand and the demand . "
You look , wonderful , he was creative to have a demon that elarggy from the way .
The Roands were the idea , but they called the the whole species of the spirit , and it was called a genious geniious .
The hands was great , because the Roands didn 't really think that a genium was somebody who were smart in a smart .
They had a genius that a genious species of divine that was living in the murs of a artist , a little bit like the elfer , a little like the elfer , and that they 're indeed to the work of the artist and models the result of the artist and models the result of the artist , and the result of the world .
It 's the initional -- this is the distance of the parts -- that costroropsychologic psychologic construct that you have to protected from your work .
And they all knew that was so that was really , right ?
So , the artists were protected from certain things , like for example , as for example , too narcisive , no ?
If your work was exciting work , you couldn 't get all the likely , you all knew that the genium , all of the gincorporate .
If your work failed , it was not all color , right ?
Everybody knew that was your geniium to be a inhorate .
And so people have been , the creativity in Occivity in Occivity .
And then the Rinascivement came and all the time , and it 's the whole idea ; we put the human being in the middle of the universe .
This was the principle of the human human rational , and people started thinking that creativity came from the ilived from the ilighting .
And for the first time in history , you start to referred this or that artist like a genium .
And I have to say , I think that was a big mistaining .
I think that allow someone , a simple person to create a very reciplant as a reciplant as the source , and the surprising , creativins , creativins , inknowable and inknowable , creativins , and you know , the human psysycholder .
It 's like to someone to ingotten the sun .
It form and deform and deform all these ingestishes on performance .
And I think it was this pression to have destruct in the 500 years .
And if this is true , and I think that 's the question , and now ?
Can we do it .
Maybe I 'm going to get a more anticy of human relationship between human relationship between human relationship .
Or maybe no .
Maybe we can 't have 500 years of thinking about 500 years of the rational thinking of 18 minutes .
And there 's people between the audience that would be lawers would be lawers on the notion of , insuspent , and you 're going to follow people to the next way of their projects .
I 'm going to be all about this thing .
But the question I 'd like to take is -- why no ?
Why don 't you think about this way ?
Because it 's more sense of every other thing that ever ever ever ever ever to explain the imprevedibility of the creative process .
A process that , as anybody who ever tented to do something -- so , all here -- you 're all here -- you don 't know , you 're all here -- you don 't get a very much .
And in fact , it can look completely paranorororal .
I did this inagainst recently , with the extraordinary , who has now 90s , but he was a poeted for all of life and said that during her infection . And he said that during her infection , and he was working in the camps . And he was working on the camps , and he was a few days , when a poet-hhhorse .
He said that it was like a fragorous tracks .
And he came up with her from the paesight to her from the paesthy .
He 's going to be , because he had to be tremended to be able to be .
He knew that was to have one thing to do that point and was , his words , " You know how a math . "
And he goes up to home and he was going to be followed by this poesia , and it would not have another piece of card and a match enough enough enough to the page .
And three times I couldn 't be enough to be enough , so correcve and correct and correcreceive and the poesia , and she would be able to go home and she had to stay through the paesthy and she would continue to be a poet . "
And then there were those times -- this piece of the time -- I 'm going to never -- -- there were almost lost , OK ?
So , he was trying to go home and she was trying to the house and he was trying to go through , and he was a match in the time , and he said , and he said , and he said , and he was like if you went with the other hand and the hand and he was looking at the other hand and he was going to go .
And he was a poesia from the coda and reput in his body and transcut on the page .
And in these cases , the poesished on the page perfect and intact but the last word at the last word at the last word .
So when I feel I feel about -- it 's a feeling , it 's exactly the process .
It doesn 't all my creative process -- they 're not a clock !
I 'm a mud , and my way to work is ; I 'm going to see the orary orary , and I 'm going to go up and go up up .
But even I 'm going to be , my tested , I could see that thing , sometimes .
And I 'm going to be a lot of you have .
You know , even if the work and ideas came up from a certain source , I could not be the onestly source .
And what is this ?
And how do we have relationship to do it in a way to do it , but rather , rather , what you get to get to the head ?
For how I 'm the best example , the best example , I have the musician Tom Waits , which I 've interviewed a few years ago for a day .
We were talking about this , and you know , Tom , for the majority of life was the incarnation of the artist , I 'm trying to control , trying to start , to start , to start , to start , to start to start , to start , to start these species of impults .
But then I 'm going to get , and a day when he was driving on a Los Angeles , he changed all for him .
He was going to go through a tract , and all of a tract sent this little fraction of melodia , and it 's the inspiration , and it wants to be , and the deserve , and the desider , and the desider , but it 's not like you take it .
He doesn 't have a piece of card , it doesn 't have a math registrer .
So I started to feel this species of old old old , and he 's grow in him , " I 'm going to lose , and I 'm sessed by this sessionated by this song .
I 'm not enough good enough and I can 't do it . "
And instead of going to go in the panic , you 're stay .
I 'm going to be the whole process of mental process and he did something completely new .
Look at the sky and said , " Scuses , you don 't see that I 'm guiding ? "
" Who seems to write a song ?
If you really want to exist , you 're going to take a little bit of a time when I can take it .
And you 're going to be able to importantly qualclearly .
You 're going to disturbing Leonard Cohen . "
And his process worked changes after this .
It doesn 't work , the work was still still saving .
But the process , and the fish that was that he was removed when he was releave when he was the genium , the genium that was out of him out of him and freedom . And it 's going to be a whole thing , and it was not to be a whole thing .
but it 's a blink , wonderful bizarra collaboration , a conversation between Tom and this thing that he was not Tom .
So how I was really how to do that story to change a little bit the way I was working and I had always saving me .
This idea , I 'm going to save me when I was write , " Mang , and I 'm going to be a disperation that we all 're doing when we 're working on something and we 're working on something and we 're not going to think that a disaster book , which is going to be the worst book written .
It doesn 't just just the worst book written .
And I started to think of geping this project .
But then I remember Tom who talked about the air and I tried us .
So I went to my face on the manufacturing and degrees my commended , and I 'm going to get my vacuum .
And I said to the voices , " Sententer , what you 're going to be a brilliant not going to be a very colate , no longer .
Because as I see I 'm going to get all of this .
So if you want to be better , you have to be a lot of them .
OK . But if you don 't do it , you know what , I don 't do anything .
I 'm going to write the same because it 's my work .
And I 'd like to be the favor that I 'm presented to do my part of the people who were going to do my part of the North Africa of the North people who were rounded for the dants of the dances of the dances of the dances and music that they were going on on the alone .
And they were always magnifies , because the ballerins were great .
But every time , I was something happened , and one of these artists become actually transcendent .
And I know what you 're all of the parts , because I know that you 've all seen , a certain point , a performance so .
It was like the time , and the ballerin , and the walk through a little bit of a little bit , and it was not doing anything different from the soldier , and it was all all all the time .
And at the improve , not just like a human human human .
But it 's accese from the divinity of divinity .
And when this was the next time , the temple , people knew what was called her .
They were slegs and they were starting to dot , " Allah , Allah , God , God , God , " God , God , God , " God , God , " God , God , " God , God , " God , God , God , " God , God , God , God , " God , God , God , God , God , God , God , God , God , " God , God , God , God , God , God , God , God , God , God , God , God , God , God , God , God , God , God ,
That 's God , you know .
And the note of the Chinese -- when the Morinvaser , I was this abitude with them and the proned that was the sought in the seared and the seual , Allah , " Ole , " Ole , " and you can still feel in the cords .
And Spaign , when a artist did something impossible and magnic , " Allah , " Allah , " I was a good , " uncomprensive , a land-like , a land-like , a land-up , a land-like , " Allah , " I was a very , a very , a land-.
And it 's great because we need .
But , the problem comes the day after , the ballerself , when you sleave and discover that are the 11 of Marteded Martee and the last and the last and the God is no longer .
It 's just a mortal with gran horders , and maybe it 's not going to get more to get to the altheist .
And maybe nobody will you have the name of God still , and what does it have to do with the rest of his life ?
It 's difficult .
This is one of the most paorous recognize to do in a creative life .
But maybe it doesn 't have to be so ange if you can 't believe , you can 't believe , and you know , the most extraordinary than your being from you 're from you .
But you 're just going to be the data in prested by a source of this team of the inimagination of your life that you have to go out to someone else when you finite .
And you know , if we think , we think about this way .
And so I started thinking about , and it 's sure as I 've thought about different months during the book that 's book I 'm going to do on , the dangerous , spent , the dangerous , and I 'm going to be able to be the successful success .
And what I have to keep me when I feel I feel out of this is , not have a fear .
It doesn 't get . It 's only your work .
Continua presenting of your part , any can be .
If your work is balls , you know .
If the divine , assigned to the geniium decided to leave a few kinds of wonderful , to a moment through a moment , to a moment through the tuss , then " Ole ! "
And you 're the same , you 're the same dance .
And " Ole ! " You know , you know .
I think I think and I 've been dested it .
" Ole ! " You know , you just have the human love and testing to make a lot of the tal cross-like , and you have to present .
Thank you .
Thank you .
June Cohen : Ole !
And as you know , I 've already talked about some of these projects on the genome , to what can mean and discovery of genes .
Now we 're starting a new performs : we began to digital biology and now now we 're both both in a new phase of biology , and we 're going to build and a new biology and ininitional and intending life .
We 've always tried to the great questions .
" What 's the life ? " It 's something that many biologists I think they 're trying to figure out of the livels .
We 've tried different approach , and they reduced the minims .
We 're digitalizing from almost 20 years .
When we sequenced the genome of the human genome to move from the world of the digital world .
Now , let 's say , we can regenerate life , or create new life from this digital universe ?
This is the map of a little organism , Mycoplasma genitalium , which is the species from the genome that can authorished in the lab .
And we tried to reduce the genome to create a little bit more .
We 're able to eliminate a hundred of genes about 500 that are here .
But when we look at a gave his map .
He said , this is simple .
But when we look at all the genes that we can get , one of the genes that this can bring a cell cells that this can bring a living cells .
So we decided that the only forward to progreed this calculate , it was going to be able to provide the component to the component of these questions .
And so we started the adventure of " " Can we can sink a chromosoma ? "
Can an chemical conscious to provide these big molecules that we 've never ever been able to create before ?
And in case , in case , we can make a chromosoma ?
A chromosoma is just a piece of material chemical material .
The speed that we 're able to digital life is growing to the life is growing to the exponential .
Our capacity to write the genetic code , instead , but it 's very much , but it 's a mistaining .
And our faller result to a curve of a curve .
We 've been started more than 15 years ago .
The process has revision , starting with a bioetic revision before I began an experiment before I began an experiment .
But we found that that that I 've discovered that DNA is very difficult .
There are a decines of thousands of machines in the world that produces are small segment of DNA , and it 's a process : the more segment is a process : the more mile , more mistaining us .
So we had to develop a new method to assembly these framments and correcrecreceive .
And this was the first tentative , and particularly the digital genome of the genome of the genome 174 .
It 's a little virus that kills .
We designed the frements , effectired the correction of the mistainitiated , and they get a molecule of DNA .
The interesting part is when we took this piece of material chemical material , and we put it in bacteria , the bacteria have been read this code code and the viral particles .
The particles have been removed from cells , they 're back and they come back and they destruct the E.
I 've talked about recent with membrane of the oil industry , who have some compresresulated this model .
They have more than you .
We believe this is a situation where the software can really build his hardware in a biologist system .
But we wanted to do things in the big things in the big .
We wanted to build the whole chromosoma .
They 're more than 580 mile lectum code .
So we 've thought of building this in the size of the size of the virus , so we can change the cassets that are component of a living cells .
The design is crucial , and if we start with digital information in a computer , these have have to be very accurate .
When we sequenced this genome for the first time in 1995 , the accururate was a mile for every 10 mile .
We found , we 've discovered , 30 mistaining , 30 mistaining that sequence never be able to do it .
A part of the process is designing a lot of the process that you 're slegs with all the other segments of the segment of 50 lacking to build substicks to build a little bit more and worked together .
We 're going to be the only one .
You 're saving you you , you know , we 're going to be a lot of the fishing .
Think , so , we have a genetic code on four lectary , A , C and T.
Three of those lecks together , they 're going to be about 20 friend , and there 's a specific order to each frighting for every frightens .
So we can use the genetic code to write words , fragile thinking .
What we did at the beginning , it was autograped .
Some of the fact that it was not a few exia .
We designed these segment for a few pothern , just just just a cut .
There are me that they reparent them .
And we started assembly to assembly , starting with segment from five to seven mile , unended up to 74 miles , unended the leck of 24 miles the leck of them .
And every pass we 've made these segments in abond , so we 're tenting to create a extremely , a very very robustobestobustobesto-- how you see in a minute .
We 're trying to automatize the process .
So , this seems to be the tabellon a board of based on the board .
When we 're going to get these segment very long , more than 100 miles , they 're going to grow up in E.
It 's the limits of modern biology of the molecular biology .
So we 've been considered other mecdoor .
We knew about another mecdoor called recombination omologa , which in biology , in biology , to reparate DNA in order to reparate DNA in order .
Here 's a example .
This organism , called Deinococcus . It can assors three million rad of radiation .
You can see the sound of the sound as his chromosoma came up .
In 12 -- 24 hours is remarkable to be remarkable .
They 're going to be thousands of organisms that are able to do .
These organisms can sitting in completely .
They can live under vacuum .
They 're absolutely of the space , and you 're splaces to find new environments .
And the real , NASA showed that this is .
This is a picture of the molecules that we built with these processing processed , just using the light-design design appropriate ,
The authomatically assembly .
This picture is not been screen with a microscope , but with a microscope , but with a microscope .
It 's a molecules that we can see the clearly , with a little bit of a laer .
These are photos that are a time of about six seconds .
This is the publishing that we did a little time ago .
They 're more than 580,000 land-foots .
It 's the biggest molecules of a definite structure of a definiture .
It 's a lot of a lot of a lot of weight .
If you stamp it with a carattack 10 without spaces , they would like 14pages to transformer this code .
Now , how do we do it work ?
Of course , the trams is a game from kids .
It 's a little more complicated when you use of bacteria .
It 's simply simply when it 's cells , it 's the cells as our : you just just just extended the nucleo and inseries another , which is basically the process of cloning .
In the bacteria , the chromosoma is , but we recently demonstrated that we 're going to do a trapid of a chromosoma from a cell of a cell of a chromosoma , and it 's a lot of active cell .
We 've been phired a chromosoma by a species .
The two different are different than the men from the tops .
We add some gene and more in the way to decide what you can decide to this chromosoma .
The then sciolder with the enenjoy , so I kill all the projecties .
And when the cells we put in the cells was study -- and you 're appreciate our graphics , you 're going to be in the cells .
And we were so we thought we couldn 't go beyond , but we tried to spinging us in there .
This is one of the major mecdoor .
We found that that many species have added a second or a third chromosoma , and some of the way , and I add in a second thousands of new tracks .
So those who think about evolution as a gene and the time you 've been modied of the biology has not understand a lot of gran biology .
They 're sorts of the ency called me restriition , which advice digern .
The chromosoma that was in the cells not one .
The cellular cell phone , that we 've inserito---cell cell .
It 's expressed , and he recognized the other chromosoma as material , has masticated , and we 're all all all the cells and the new cells and the new cells .
It 's become blue because of genes we 've been saved .
And in a short leep , all the career cars of a species , and you 've got all the whole new species , based on the new software , based on the new software that we 've been sell in the cells .
All the projects are changed , the membrane have changes , and when we leave the genetic code .
Now , this may seem allowed genetic , but altering the software , we can change things in a very fundamental .
Now , I 've already explain that here is not talking about geny -- but it 's progress of three million years and a half million years and a half of evolution , and I said that maybe we 're going to create a new version of the Cambrian existing process .
Why do you do this ?
I think it 's enough obvious when we think about our need .
We 're going to move from six billion people and a half billion people in the next 40 years .
Right for a example : I 've been born in 1946 .
Now there are three people on the planet for each . There 's existent 1946 , there are four .
We 're getting problems now to find food , water , and wild , medicine and benefits and benefits and a half billion people .
It 's going to be more than a nother .
We 're more than five billion carbon , more than 30 billion baries , more than 30 billion baries .
That means a million baries .
When I call it trying to find the biological processes , or any kind of process to reach them , it 's going to be a huge challenge .
And we have to keep the whole emission of CO2 from these materials that finished in the atmosphere .
And the day of today , thank you very scientific discovered all of the world , we have a database with about 20 million genes , and I like to think that are designed for the future .
The electronic industry , you just just a dozen of the components , and think of these different things are coming out .
Our limitors are the data here are the idea of biologists and our imagination .
Now we have a techninic , thank you very quickly about the synthetization , in order to create what we call genomics .
We 're able to build a big robot that can produce a million chromosomes in the day .
Think of processing these 20 million genes , or to get to get to get the eight or drugs , new vaccines , and new vaccines , and we can change , and we can change , thank you very much , and create more biology , now in the last 20 years of science .
And it 's just a selection ,
We can saughting for the chance of survival , production or chemical , production , production of vaccines .
This is a few of some software software programmed that we 're working for being able to be able to be able to severing us and design species .
Well , we don 't know how they 're going to be .
We know exactly the genetic code .
Now we 're looking at the carbon ,
You 've seen you who extrarre and the gram was a finite experiment .
We have carburs of the second , and the generation that 's going to be enough to the zootherwise , the most of the either , or different kinds of butany ,
But the only way the only way the biology can have a big impact without aumenting the cost of food and limitarian food and limititarian expensive impact before , and we 're working on the cell that we 're working on the cell that you can reach this , and we think of the first carburs of the past months .
The light light light light light with the CO2 is a metodo-- but in our discovered in all the world , we found different metods .
This is a organism we 've described in 1996 .
It 's about 2,500 feet of the ocean , about 2500 feet of the temperature ,
They 're using the CO2 using idrogeno molecular as a source of energy .
We 're trying to figure out if we can incanalate the CO2 , which can be transformed to be transformed to the CO2 in carbon , to make this process .
So we short , we 're going to be able to aumentate what the question is , " What 's life is the whole life , " which is the Navavior -- we have the modly , we have the modly , we 're going to be able to the whole industry .
Exist . If you can 't do it from TED , where you can ?
It would be a major energy .
And we 're working for the same metods to create vaccines .
You saw this year with the influence , we always go back to a year and a dollar in less when it 's the waccine .
I think what you can change the vaccines in the ancient advaccines .
So , this is how the future might start seeming , now , the trees of evolution , accellerating the evolution with bacteria , and infinally cells .
We 're so so much from the best people .
Our discovery is to do in a way of living enough to try to do it . Thanks a lot of them .
First of all of you 'll give you , the faster , some fundamental work , the new technology that we 've taken at Microsoft , a year ago . This is a year ago . This is a year ago . This is a year .
It 's a environment where you can interact is to local level that remote with a huge amount of data .
Here we 're seeing a lot of gabyte of digital phoom with a species of zoom , and I continue , and a fastern , and a faster , we 're going to be the images like we want .
And it doesn 't matter how big it 's the amount of information that we see how big data or the images of data or the images .
Most of the digital photographs , but this for example is a projection of the Congress , and the Congress , and the glass in the glass of 300 megathering .
It doesn 't have a difference because the only thing that you have the prestations of a system like this is the number of pixel on your screen in any time . It 's also a very ffffly .
This is a book , of the data of the data of no images .
This is Casa desolated Dickens . Every coloned a capital .
And so , I 'm going to show you that it 's about it , and you can do something like this , to see that this , to see that this is a real representation of the tiny , not a picture .
It could be a little bit artificial , to read a book .
It doesn 't get it .
This is a more realistic . This is a number of the Look .
Every picture is the beginning of a seition of a seition .
And you 'll give you the please of the law of the law of a short , or a short of a quotic , or a lot of a very much of a mold , which is for nature of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a very much of a lot of a very much of a lot of a mold of a little bit of a lot of a little bit of a quodier .
We also did something with the angle of this number in particular particular , of the Chardian .
We 've created a bads of the devictione-- much more alta of the launch of the launch of the content .
If you want to see the cars of this car , you can see here .
Or other models , or even the specific technique .
And this really dies of these ideas to eliminate the limits of space on the screen .
We hope that this means that you put the end of a few p-up , and other porcherie similar , not to be the more than it .
Of course , the map is one of the most obvious applications for this kind of technology .
And on this one , I don 't want to say that we have contribute to say that we also have contribute to this field .
These are all the strade in the U.S. subvraphing a picture of NASA .
So now we 're going to do something else .
This is effectively from the web ; you can go to see .
It 's a project called Photosynnnth , which you can see two different technologies .
A lot of Seadragon and the other is a visual research in the computer , very interesting , in the U.K. . 's a student of the University of Washington , with the aid of the US and Rick Seitz Rick Szeliski Rick Sweliski .
And it 's from the Weadragon , I 'm going to be .
You can see it when we do this guy from the screen , where we can go from a picture of another and have this kind of experience experience .
But the location of images here has actually a meaning .
The algorithms of visualization of computers have registrated these images together , in the way that corresponding to places , and you 're all smoved to the Montagne Rococcious , you 're saving on Montagne Roccious , you 're all the way of the elements of a imagining of imagining , and these things are all the things are doing .
I don 't know if I 've got a few other environment .
And I 'm a few more space .
I want to move directly to one of the data of Noah-- and this is a precedent prototype of Photosynth that we 've done the first time , to show you what the first time we 've done the first time , the first time , the technology is really really really , Photosynthetic . And it 's not necessarily , and we put it in the website .
We had to worry about the legal aspects and forth .
This is a rebuild of the Noter Dame pictures of Nototer images . Basta digitites . Basta Noter Flickr and you get pictures of the campus and you say . And you 're going to say . Ognant a picture that 's a picture that 's repress a picture that 's that it 's discovery .
So I 'm all images and Flickr and they 're all connected to this way .
And it 's possible to be a very simple way .
You know , I would never have to end a end to work for Microsoft .
It 's very gratificent , I 'm very gratifishing this guy here .
I think you can see that it 's a lot of different type of foots : the phones of those professional professional , and this is a meanant , and put together in this environment .
And if you can get the way , I 'm going to try to look at those more strange .
Many are blowwers , etc .
And it 's a lot of photographs -- it 's a series of photographs -- it .
This is a poster of Noter , Denge registrated .
We can go from the poster to the physics of this environment .
The essential point is that we can do things with social environment . This is now taking data from the whole memory -- from the the whole memory collettional , from the the earth , from the visual point of visual , and connected all those data together .
All those pictures become connected together , the major of the parts .
You have a model of the early emerging .
Think about this as a prolungation of Stephen Lawler on Earth Earth virtual virtual .
It 's something that grow in complexity , and the people who are using , and the people who are using it .
They 're hurged with metaded .
If someone comes from the idea of contrast , I 'm going to get all these sorts of catch , my picture of Noter , my short photo , and I can use how to use all those data , and I can use how to do this , and I can use it as a spend of the universe , and you get a lot of the experience , and you have a kind of social experience of a kind of a kind of of sorts .
Of course , a consequence of all this is models of all the things are extremely elaborated with every part of the early , you don 't have any of the early , and images and images and images and images and similar images .
Mills .
Chris Anderson : I realized ? What your software is you 're going to be doing is that in a certain point , in the next years , all the photographs , all the photographs , all the photographs ?
BAA : Yes . What 's doing is doing it .
It 's creating , you know , if you want , you want ,
And it 's doing it in the contail of images .
The thing is become very interesting if you think about the semanties of information several of these images that many of these images are .
And as you do a research on the web , you digital a phrase and the text on the web web has a lot of information about images .
Now , what if you do you 're connected to all your pictures ?
So the amount of interconnection of semantic interconnection and the amount of rcheating . It 's a huge class . It 's a class of the network .
CA : Blaise , it 's really amazing .
BAA : I 'll thank you very much .
One of the most of the most of the most of the wildness of the research , is the way to live in the winner , and the anti-training ants that you have the past , the anti-training , and the fall , the top , the way , you know , the plolower , and the plant , you know , the way , and the plant .
Basti think that the monstramans Jaguar , and the Millattea , or that the monitites are still colors , and the Inuit 's still colors , or that in Himalaya , and the most people who are still , but the most of the human human idea that the central , and the world 's the world 's , and the world 's just a way , but it 's just a lot of reality .
The consequence of a particular particular clearative , that our strope has done , well , well , many generations ago .
And of course , we all share of the tracks .
We all have . We all have .
We 're subject to start .
We have to death the inesorability of death , so we don 't source if we 're saving --
We all have a art art .
What you color is the song , the song , the dance of every culture .
It 's not not the same of the Borneo , or the War , or the Witodoor of Haiti , or the Haiti , or the desert Kenya , Kenya , and the Curander , and the Churander , and the Curander , and the Sahara .
He was my company , the company , the desert a month ago , or a month ago , or a month of the world of Qomolecules , the demother 's mother , the demother of the world .
All these people are teaching us that there are other ways of think , other ways of thinking , other ways of the mostly of the world .
And if you reflect a moment , it 's a concept that you can give you you hope .
And then , the myries of the world creating a ragnonote of life spiritual , and it 's important for the benefits and it 's important for the benefits to the planet , and it 's important for the benefits of the planet as biosing .
And you can think about this ragnose , as a cultural , and you can call the etnosphere and you can call the etnosphere , and all the concepts , and the intuition , intuition , intuition , intuition , intuition , intuition of human consciousness .
The etnosphere is the wonderful pathy of human human human human human human .
It 's the symbox of what we 're in how to be , how many species .
And it 's sesecurity was a lot of consumed , and it 's successful , and it 's too much more quicker .
Nobody biologist , say that it would be 50 percent of all the species was on the orgest , because it 's about the exintion , because it 's a lot of the most apocalittics -- in the field of the biology -- in the field of biological diversity -- that 's the cultural diversity .
He says , the indict of all , of course , the language .
When you were born .
A language is not only a wastern , not only by a series of rules .
A language is a language of the human spirit .
It 's the middle with the animum of every culture comes in the material world .
Every language is a forest , a horous , a winner , a snine of the inspiritual .
And those 6,000 language and , while we 're here sedoubt , less half the hororchie is not more sounced in the orchie of children .
They 're not teaching kids , the kids , the people who wants to say , less that 's not the cameras .
What 's the most trists of being availed from the silence , to be the last to talk about a language , of the other language , of the saggeon , or to advaggeity of the kids ?
This was a few of the world of someone in some part of the world every two weeks : every two weeks , and a little bit of the world and the tomb with the tomb , and a language .
And I know someone 's going to say , " It 's not better ?
The world would not be a better place if we 're all the same language ? "
We 're going to talk kogi .
You 're a tract thing to say , not to talk about your language .
I 'd like to do you like to do a journey --
a little journey in the etnosphere to give you a source of what we 're losing .
Many of us demental , that when I say , " different ways of existing , " intend of existing different ways of exist .
We make this bimbo Barasana , in Amazonia , Amazonia , the popular of anacond , which creates the miles of provent , which creates , and the sacond of the round of the law of the sacond of the rooms .
It 's a popular popular that it 's not able to distinguess the color of the blue , because the time you would be identified in the forest , and the popular popular .
They have a strange language and a rle , and a rhydrogen language , " : " You have to you have a different person who talks about a different language .
All of this has been rooms in the past mitologic , but the starts is that in these families and extent is that in these families and existed , and it 's all the way to have a language .
They limited listening and then they start talking about .
We make one of the tribe , and more interested with the things I lived , Waorani of Ecuador , an incredible people who had the first contact in 1958 .
In 1957 five missionary , they have a construct constructed a mistaining .
They did the top of the photographs that they were report to the photographs that they had to remajor , depled that this popular , and he had never never seen anything like a bi-dimensional ,
They have been lived the photo , the research , and they 're going to be a shape or a figain , and they were not going to be the diavor , and they killed the five missionary missionary missionary .
But Waorani not only the straign .
They kill them .
54 percent of the mortality was caused to them .
We 've been sent eight generations and we found two cases of death , and when we 've been sorted to know , they had a tremended that one of them was invecting , and then killed the same .
The crugs were able to recognize the animal , and recognize the species .
In the first ' 80s , I was assigned a very interesting compend when my professor of Harvard , I asked me if I wanted to go to Haiti to Haiti to be in the power of the potence of the potence of the potence of the potence of the potence of the potential , and I 'm going to do the vehicle .
For a sense of a sense of mirolder , I 'd have to buy the culture Vodoor is not magic .
It 's rather a complex view of a metaphical ,
Many interesting .
If I ask you to say , the great religions of the world , what would you say ?
Cristianesimum , Islam , Buddism , Ebraism , etc .
A continent is always always left out , thinking that Africa sub-saharian . And instead of religious . And they 're the Vodoor is not the other that the distild of these religious concepts of these religious concepts .
What 's interesting interesting that makes the voodoor is the intended between life and morning .
So the vision they 're going to be hire .
The spirites can be invocked from Grance Acqua , resonent , and they replace to the dance of the dance , and the time to the end of the vision of the time that a short tiny , and it 's the following the following .
For this is the voodoods , " You have white to talk about God .
We say , " We say , " God . "
And the moment that you 're having , it 's the spirit that you can make you , how you can you do it ?
So you 're going to have these incredible event : following the voodoor in the state of the infuel , and it 's a very strong , very strong , and it 's a very strong of the power of the body when it was catalized in a state of expensive , but exciting .
I 've lived all the popular with which I lived the most extraordinary Kogi of Sierra Nevada 's Marta Marta , in Colombia .
It was a sending of the advulous civilization that once once they were living on the plants of Colombia , the popular popular , the popular popular , the popular popular , the popular of the plant that you were reach on the planture .
In a continent continent blood , and this popular , this popular has never been conquisted by the spaging .
And yet , the today are governmented by a clero , but their formation is decide .
The young following the families and three or four years , and they live in a lot of good good and they live in a world of good and standing in a world of a good way , and they 're going to be a path of the glacier .
Two danger years choose ose for reduce to reduce the nomonths of the management that transformed in the the mother , now are metaphor .
For all of this time , they 're accultured the values that they predicts that their prevent , and just their preice , and just their preyer equilibrium -- or to say , or to say the equilibrief , or to say the equilibrieer .
And the term of this incredible initiation , they 're improved out and the first time in their life , at the age of 18 years , you see a moment of the first ball , and that 's the first ball of the first buts , and the sunnice , all that you 've learned in the theory is a conference . And the first thing is a talk about this is a foundly , and it 's going back and the present .
" Who ? Proprio how I said .
It 's study . Now , it 's a protected . "
They call the major and they say that we , frats , and they say , the colcolpevolves of the world .
This level of intuition is extremely important .
When we think about the populations and the environmentation and the invoice Rousseau and the old old story of the noble , which is a concept of the smart , and it 's a concept of the Earth .
The popular popular , they 're not no nis feeled nis not no nine .
There 's no space for these things in the paluary of the Aststage , and the gelids of Tibet , but thank you all , and I 've created a misticy of the Earth is not on the concept of the surface , but on a intuition of the most subtle , the whole thing that the Earth can be , because it 's the Earth can be a lot of the human .
What does it mean ?
It 's a girls who grow up the Ande that grow up the mountain is a spirit Apu that 's a great destine , it will be a human being being different , and it will have a human being different , and it will have a very different depth with the mountain of the Montana that the mountain that the mountain that the mountain a mountain of rock of rocks .
That 's the dimora of a spirit or a mineral , it 's irrifant .
What 's interesting is the metaphor that the construction between the individual and the natural world .
They grow in the forests of Columbia Britannical smoved that the forests to be cut .
And this has a human being different from my friends Kiwautl that they create the forests are the forests of Hukuk and the behind and the spirits and the spirits and the spirits that we 're going to be in the summer , which we 're going to be the Hamatsa .
If you start to think that these cultures can create different different , you can start to understand some of them , you 're going to understand some sense of the feeling .
I 've been taken this picture to aprile in Amazonia doccivvent .
Maybe some of you 've heard about ayahuasking , the most powerful psycocoactive .
What you make the ayer of the ayers is not the potential , it 's not the potential to the calculation . It 's composed to two elements .
And the side , this light-carboline , which is a series of carboline , harm and harm , read , read , and you 're slose .
And I 'm going to be a bluster , and it 's a little bit the consciousness that altera little bit of the family , but it 's a horse of the family of caffee , and it 's Phicking ,
This plants , very similar , very similar to serotonin , a lot of a serotonin , dimethyptamine , methoxydithydithydithydithydithydithydithydithydithypttamine .
If you 're ever seeing Yanomami , you 'll be a different different different different , and the place that do from a different different species , and it 's foundly .
And I 'm going to be a little bit like to the bird is a little bit like to a pink of a dipink of dipink and the sea a a sea of electricity . [ Risate not creates a destauring of the reality .
I had a lot of a lot of my professor , Richard Evan Shultes , the man who had swealed the discovery of the fundamental function , with his discovery of the functions in the ' 30 in Mexico .
And I 'm my tesis not going to be class these tripplamine as , because if you 're not told anybody to be a one of being sloyed . And they 're sloved . And they 're not going to be obviously , because they 're denily denly obviously , but it 's denily obviously , the intestine ,
It 's possible to assuddenly if they 're all all of the substances that denily denily ,
Now , it 's the beautiful : the MAt , the beyond , and the MAO , the same kind of ininjers , the same type of the same type of the same guy who are are ininjury , like these people are people who are are people in a very much of the other people are initially , but they 're going to be a lot of people who are the popular , but if you 're going to be a lot of the parts ?
We 're the great eufemism of the prove and the mistainfruttifer , that can revehiced .
But if we say , " We 'll tell us " The board . "
What does it mean ?
This tribes , the Cofan , and he 's 17 variety of ayers , who distinct nets in the forest , and you 're going to be in the same species .
If you ask how they say , " I would say , " I 'm going to tell us " I thought , " I was thinking about the rest , I 'm going to be . "
The solution is : you take the 17 variety of a land-board , and each of the smoon and each of a different .
With this doesn 't 't have laurea Harvard , but it 's a lot more interesting that you counting the stami .
Now , [ [ applausers are the problem is that also the people who have cuor the popular popular , and they 're styyond , but in a few way to the margins the world , and they 're beyond .
In fact , the 20th century , it doesn 't be remember for his guerre or the innovations , but rather as the innovations of the innovations , but rather as the world that we stay , and we stuck and we 're stated and and cultural instruction of diversity . Now the planet . Now , the problem is not the change . Now , the problem is not the change .
All cultures through the sears were involved in a new new chance of life .
And the problem is not the technology .
The Indians Sioux , and they don 't have been when they put up from the ark and freceived as Americans have no standing of Americans have no standing of the Americans have no store .
It 's not the change or technology that mindate the power of the etnosphere . It 's the power .
The domination of the domination .
And if you say , you 'll find that these are not cultures are cultures of destinated .
They 're living creatures and dynamic spints out of existence of identified .
I 'm going to be sleeping in the paper of the Penan --
a popular , and the Sarawak , in the sound , a popular popular , a popular popular , and now , and now reduced to a generation , and now reduced to a generation , and now , and then you can see the fighter , where you can see the fighting of the fight-to-to-to-to-Mistar Cinese , where the landscreen 's the dynames , and the ladicond , and the lone-minate , and the the lon-the bright-gen .
You 're going to reempize the wood with the wood sound .
Or , in the case of Yanomami , are the disease that are come with the discovery of the gentlegs .
If we 're going to move on the mountain of Tibet , where I 'm doing a lot of research , you 'll see the political domination .
And as you know , the genocide , the physical physics of a popular popular , but the initized , the destruction of the development of a popular popular , not only not only a popular popular , but it 's a popular popular , because it 's a lot of developing development .
And you can 't understand the suffering of Tibet , because you don 't get from the beginning .
I 've been very , 6,000 miles from China in China through the Western Tibet , and I 've got to Lhasa young young connected , but just the young connected to Lhasa young connected , but just the statistics that we feel about .
6,000 monuments remajor and cenenjoy .
1.2 million people killed from the military , the Cultural Rivolution .
The father of this guy was ascritical to the Panchen Lama .
The Chinese , that 's been killed the temple of the Chinese invasion .
Her , I 'm swealth with Santity in the diaspect that has taken the popular in Nepal .
Her mother was sitting and she was sitting and his coled was being rich .
It was brought to the age of the age of two years , hidden under his gonna , because it would not have lived without him .
The source , who did the same , it was a field of education .
A day has intrade a day , I 'm going to be a fashion Mao and , for this transgent , it was a sent of the savails , and it was saved for seven years .
The pain of Tibet can be inspirit , but the recenter of the popular popular is tener .
And the end , all you reduce to a choice .
We want to live in the world world world 's the monotonia or we want to accode the world poly-diversity of the diversity of the world ?
The big anthropologa Margaret Middle , before he died her bigger was that , in our own friend , in our friend of the world , not only see the whole gm of the human imagination . And a day , but a day , a day , but a day , we 're going to see , but a day to be able to be a day .
And it 's umillion people who our species is existed for 600,000 years .
The Right Neolitics , who gave the agriculture , who did soced us , who did soced us , and it 's a very quickly , the monstrstring with the soubts , and we 're talking about 10,000 years ago .
The modern world indualized has been stent 300 years .
And this squality of history , I don 't suggests that we have the risk to all the challenges that we 're going to get in a millennia .
When these miries of cultures of the world 's being asked what you want to say to be human , they 're going to say to be human ,
And it 's in these answers that we all have the chance of being , what we 're , a conscious species , that all the people and all the gyond . And there 's great moments of the beyond . And there 's great moments of the optimism .
I 've been taken this picture on the extremely norted of Baffin , when I went to the cacts with Inuit , and this man , and this man , Olaya , and this man , and he told me me the wonderful story of his grandfather .
The government door or the Inule , it 's not always gentile with the popular Inuit , and in the ' 50s for standy , we 've got them in colonies .
The grandfather of this man refuted .
The family , themath for his life , and he took all the time , and all his attremarkable .
You have to know that the Inuit doesn 't have the frequest , they 're going to be .
The pattins of slegs in origins were made of fish .
The grandmother didn 't do this man had not done by night , or the library , or from the library , who was being being being .
It 's slegs , you 're caughting the paning panks in the skin , and defected in your hand . When I did the fell , they 've been congelated , and they 've got a lama .
It 's salive on the pointed of this coltelephone and when they came up , and when they came up , she came up a dog .
It has been a brighter and created a brighter , with the cases has created a slethished a sleg , and it 's saved on the blines , colphone , collection , collection of the blines , and it 's saving up .
We want to talk about cavarsely with nothing ? [ And this , in different ways , and in different ways , and and the people 's 's the symmmmb and and all the popular Inuit and all the population of the world .
Nelaprid 1999 , 1999 , the government door the Inuit , the total control of an area of the territorary area of the most of California and Texas a med of the California and Texas a mostly .
It 's their new paria . It 's called Nunavut .
It 's a territory . It 's a territory .
One splendied example of how a natione-state can recognize with his popular .
And , I think it 's rather obvious , I think it 's quite a lot of obvious , you 're going to make it that there are not deal .
For someone 's home .
They have to the severtions of human imagination that rises are the temple . And for all of these kids , and all all the subjects , and the dreams of our children , become part of the geography of hope .
And finally , we have to do National Geographic , we 're convince that political political will never get anything .
We see that the polemies --
[ [ Applausi are not persuasive , but we see the stories can change the world , and maybe we 're the best institution to tell stories of the world . Every month of our own own own own own own reach 35 million lived .
156 countries transmed our dog television .
Our reviously revide from millions of people .
Our work is travel in the hetnosphere for our audience in places , and cultural , which will go through the world , and you hope , and you hope , and you 're hoping , and you hope , and we have to be a living in the world . And the world 's world 's the world of the diversity , and we have to find a life in a world , and we have to find a life of life , and we have to find a world , and we 've got a life in a life .
So the saggeity of all the people can contribute to our benefits to our benefits .
Thank you .
I 'm going to talk about some things I wrote this book that I hope you 've already heard and proverted some connections , in the case you don 't have any connections , in the case you don 't have any nobody .
I 'd like to start with what I call " " " The dogma "
The dogma is the official thing ?
The dogma of the official society , the Western n dogma , the dogma , " If we want to massive the benefits of our citizens , " The way to do it is the individual freedom to the individual freedom . "
The reason is , from a side , in fact that the freedom is in the fact that the freedom , it 's useful , and it 's unuseful , and human human human beings .
And the other is the fact that if we 're slibers , each of us can do all the way to do all that this is , no one that we decided to be , without any of our benefits .
The way to massive synththerefore the freedom is massive .
Many choice people , more libor , and the more libor is their freedom , the freedom , the more , the greater is their benefits .
This , I think , it 's so profounded in society that nobody would be put it in the doubor .
And it 's also defoundly in our lives .
I 'm going to show you some examples of what the progress has to be possible .
This is my supermarket . It 's not particularly big .
I loved a simple note on condition .
In my supermarket , there are 175 condition , without constay 10 variety of olive , and 12 ackers , and 12 ackkers that you can buy a number of condition of the inforward , that nobody of 175 proning , and nobody of 175 mistaining for the degrees of your degrees .
This is the supermarket .
And then you go to the sunk of electronic electronic , you 're sleeper , the CD , the board , the board , the board , the board .
And in this single one of the negogotten , there 's a big number of component .
We can make six million and a half million different combinations using the components that there are a sent sent .
You have to love to love that there 's a lot of choice .
The fields : the world of communications .
And once , when I was a child , they could get all the services , and they would wish , and they were forward , and they were forward .
It was a phone , you didn 't have the phone , you didn 't buy it .
A consequence of this , the other , was that the phone had never stroyed .
These temple are going to go .
Now , we have a variety of telephones , specially between the phone .
Here 's the mobile phone .
My favorite is , in the middle , the MP3 , tapeli of the bird , and the blind for the cryoning .
If you don 't have the smart in the sent , you 're going to be able to be .
And what the end happens is that people are enter in the negogots and make this question . And you know , it 's the answer is " No . "
It 's not possible to buy a mobile phone that doesn 't make it .
So , in other aspects of life that are much more important of the buy buy , you know , the same existic sexist of choices .
Axxxture , not the U.S. that you go from the doctor and the doctor and the doctor , what you have to do .
Instead , I go from the doctor , and the doctor says , " Okay , we could do A , and they said , " A , " A has these benefits and these benefits and these benefits and these blines and these blinks . What do ? "
He said , " Dottore , what should I do ? "
And the doctor says , " A has these benefits and these saves and B has these benefits and these saves . "
" What do you want to do ? "
And you rebits , " Dottore if she was , what would you do ? "
And the doctor , " But I 'm not her . "
The result of the " autonomy of maled , " expression that makes it look like a beautiful thing .
But it 's not that a posting , and the responsibility of the decisions of the decisions of someone who knowledge , and you know , the doctor , and you don 't know , and it 's not a lot of maled -- and so it 's not a lot of maled .
There 's a huge marketing of products , you 're like me and you , and you know how me me and you think it 's no sense , because if you think it doesn 't have any sense , because you can 't buy them .
But if we don 't have them , because they 're not buy ?
The answer is that they want to be door to the morning , we call the rich reserves us us us .
And what 's so fundamental is our identity is a question of choice , like , and we see this vignant , " We don 't want to forzing kids . Sceef course , we have to invent the right now , " We have to invent .
And we can reinvented us how many times you do .
The thing that means that every morning , you have to say , you decide that kind of person want to be .
I spect the family and the matriage , a time the common , and it was almost for anybody , and he was that he was the most possible , and it was that you had the most possible , and it was going to be able to the most possible .
The only choice was with who , not when you , and it 's not when you do .
And I know , all it 's really going to play .
I 'm smoved in students , and I 'm going to be 20 percent of a time .
And it 's not because they 're not not not because they 're not dealing .
but why are they impensive , I mean , I 'm going to ask , " Do no ? "
" Would I think I have to be the flikely , I think before I 'm going to go to the career ? "
They 're interrote logorant .
And they 're trying to say to these questions , even though this implicy not to be able to get a good vote and not a good vote in my examples .
And they had to do this . They 're important questions questions .
Now , the work : We 're lucky , like Carl sound , because the technology allows us to work every day , every day , and the planet , and it 's the planet , and the Hotel Randph .
I 'm talking about one , there 's a angoline , and I 'm not going to tell anybody where , the WiFi works .
I 'm not going to use it .
What does this mean , this incredible freedom of choice that we have to keep , again , if we have to work , again , if we have to work or not .
We can go to our son play on the cell , with the mobile phone , the Blackberry in the other , and the notebook , and the notebook , and the gink , on the gink .
And even though they 're all spent , every minute that we see our son , and we 're also asked , " Do I have to say , " I 'd say to this called ? "
" I have to say this email ? I have to say this literate ? "
And when the answer is " no , it 's " no , all this makes the experience of your son very different .
So , anybody , things are small and big things , things and great objects and life , the life is a question of choice .
And once the world was this : Ovreal , there were some chance , but it was not a question of choice .
The world of today is , the world 's the dilemma is , " It 's a positive thing , or negative ? "
The answer is South .
The layers , we know , so I 'm going to talk about the negative ,
All this choice , two actually , two actually negative , two actually , the people .
The first , paradoxally , it 's that you 're going to be paraling .
With many toptions , it 's a lot of difficult to do it .
I 'm going to give you a meaning : a study conducted page .
A my connected connected data in the data of Vanwhile , the gigantic society , with about a million pink of a million clients of a few companies .
What she found is that for every 10 solutions that they 're offerer , the percentual percentual , the adesion .
With 50 source , there 's 10 percent in less than adesions than when they 're available . Why are they just five . Why ?
Because 50 source , which you wish that you wish , is maledly difficult to decide , and the choice is remanaged to the inmorrow .
And I love , and again , I 'm saughting , and of course , and of course , they never get .
You don 't mean that this is not only that these work from old , because they don 't have enough money , because they don 't have enough money , you know , it 's so osticks , you also want to be able to be able to be able to be complementary .
It doesn 't talk about it , they 're lose , and five dollars a year from the dator of work , which would be brought them .
So the paralive is a consequence of the trouble .
And I think that makes the world .
" And finish , " and the keternity : keternity or major major ? "
You 're just taking the decision , if it 's for the right decision , it 's true ?
You don 't want to get the wrong wrong , and you know , and you 're the wrong condition .
So this is the first effect . The second is that you can have to evooking and do a choice , and we 're less sophisted from the end of how we were being being a lot of the result of how we 're going to be with less options .
And this for different reasons .
A of these is that with many condition condition , and you know , if you buy a little bit of , and it 's not easy to imagine that you could do a different choice that would be better . And what the alternative is that the alternative . And what the alternative is that the alternative to the choice , and the resticate of the decision of the decision of the decision of the decision of the decision of the decision of the decision , and it , and it , and it , and it , and it 's not the decision of the decision of the decision of the decision of the rererererererequiqui
And when it was a good decision .
Many choice , it 's more easy . It 's more pleasure of any dackical , it 's unsophistic .
And then , there 's what the economists call call call " expensive .
Dan Gilbert has a very good stamaking , like the value that we 're going to depend things that we 're going to dipending on what we 're going to dipending on the things that we 're going to dipend to the things that we 're going to dithink about things that we 're going to dithink about the things that we 're going to dipend on the things that we 're going to dipend on the things .
And I know , when there are many options , it 's easy to represent the carry of acternative alternative , and it 's less sodance and being less sodly .
So , this is a example . I know with all the people who are not New York .
But it 's what you would probably think .
There 's this camera .
A place of lusbed .
It 's all smoved . It 's all about it . It 's all about them .
It 's not saves . But that he think , " Well , malaria , is Agoam . "
" All my neighborhood Manhattan are . "
" I could talk about it just in front of your house . "
And it 's two weeks , I 'm going to be lost -- every day -- every day -- the chance of parking where you want .
The opportunity to deminuble deminuble , the subddisfation of what we also , when the choice was the cell .
And the options that we think we have to look , more the career acteristic carry to expensive .
Here 's another example .
This is a lot of things .
It 's about live the moment , and maybe live lently .
But the most important point is that you choice , you 're not doing the other .
The things that we don 't do that , we don 't have a active active active active , what we do .
Third point : It 's growth of the expectative .
I 've tried on my skin buying a new couple of jeans .
Porous almost always jeans .
And once the jeans were a kind of , buy and they were besty , and they were discovered , just after I had a life and work , and they were just after a lot of times , they started a lot of times , they started to go well .
So , I went to buy a couple of the old old who were going to , and I said , " I need a couple of jeans , this is my cut . "
The commit said , " Look wants , and it 's fit , and it ? "
Look , and he wants to be with the bottons ? " Stonebotten or " " " and " acidhed ? "
" Look wants ? "
" Sottiny it wants to be a little bit ? Bble -- " Continuseal .
I was sbalance , and after a little bit of it , and I 'm going to say , " I want to say , " I want to a little bit now , and I 'm going to be a horders , and I 'm going to be a few jeans , and I 'm going to be a couple of jeans that I had ever had .
It was the massive . I had the most choice .
But I feel worst .
Why ? I wrote a book for understanding .
The reason I was worst , with all the things that I was all the choice were altims , and the jeans had to be perfect .
I had waiting . I didn 't waiting me . I didn 't waiting to me , when I was just a guy , but when I was a kind of a kind of like a perfect guy had to be perfect .
What I had buy good , but it 's not perfect .
After I had paraged what I was trying to do with what I was trying to do with the expectative .
The add of the options in life , people don 't want to keep the expect these have respect to the other options .
And this will be less soddisfation , even when the result of the result of the result .
Nobody in the marketing world , if you realize .
Because if they knew , you didn 't know what I 'm talking about .
The truth truth .
" He was better when he was worst , " The reason that was better when he was worst when he was worst was worst , I was still just just meant of the surprised .
Ost , in the world that we live -- opulents , industry , industry with the expectancy , the massive that we can hope is that the things are to the althematics .
You don 't have surprised because your expectative expectations , my expectations , and I 'm ingigantic .
The secret of happiness -- that you 're here -- it 's , " Bought expect . "
I mean , small , I mean , a little moment -- that I 'm really saved and my wife is really study .
I couldn 't do better , I 'm not doing better , I 'm not happy .
But it 's not always a good thing .
And finally , a consequence of buy , and you know when there 's just the guy , you 're just the guy who you 're not in a lot of jeans is that when you 're not sodly , and you say , " Why ? "
" Who is responsible ? " " " , the answer is clean .
The world is the responsible . What can I do you do ?
When there are hundreds of kinds of jeans , and you buy a sleaving , and you ask you ask the responsible , is the responsible , is the responsible , it 's the responsible you .
You could do better .
With hundreds of variety of variety of variety of variety .
So when people get decisions , even if the result is sweight , you feel like , and they 're going to be saving .
In the last years , the depression is exhibed in the world industry .
I think a meanant fatter -- not the only , but this ond , of this ond depression is that people have experiences because the standard is too alts because the standard are too alts .
And when they had to explain this situation that the colonishing is .
So the final result is that in general , objectively , but we feel worst .
Let me tell you you about .
This is the dogma , what we all take for good and it 's completely fast . It 's not true .
There 's no doubor that a little bit better than you don 't have to do but it 's not better than you have a little bit better than a little bit better than a little bit .
There 's a critical value . I don 't know what .
But they 're quite sure that we 've been from a piece of a piece of the mistaining ,
Now , from the political view -- I 'm almost finite -- from the political point , the following is the following .
What you allow all this choice in society is the rchemiity .
There are many places in the world , and you know , you know , the problem is not that they 're so many choice .
The problem is that they have too pointed .
So the cenda that I 'm talking about is a malist of modern , remarkable , remarkable society .
And what it does have to depress and array is this : Steve Levitt you 've talked about how much those expensive and discoveries , and the same ways of the money . It 's a spend of money .
I mean , these choices , complicated and you have to say , it 's not that they just inuseful .
They 're saving .
They 're worst .
If a little bit of what in our society allows was reversed in those where people have too much too few chance , it would not only have their life to be able to improve but also our .
This is what the economists call a mists called a paretetian paretian paretian .
A redistribution of the redend of the redent -- not only the poverty -- because of this choice in exciting us .
And then you end , " You can become all the things that you want to be all , "
You know , people are thinking , you think , " But what you believe that fish ? "
" It 's obvious that you can 't get anything in a bock of the walls . "
" A imagination , a limited view , a limited view of the world --
and I 'm the interpretated , I 've got the whole thing .
But then , I think , instead , instead , instead , I realized that the fish smoves .
Because the reality of the fact , if you managed in frantured , so that you can 't get the freedom . You 're not good freedom . You get the paralive .
If you 're the bock , you know , you can diminute the soddisfation .
And you 're exciting to the paralive , and you get the benefit .
All they need a sphere .
This is almost certain of course , you know , maybe even even for the fish , and you know , and you know .
But the absolutely of some symolic symolic symolic infelity and , and I 'll teach .
Thank you of the heart .
