Last year , I showed these slides to show that the glacial calottical calottica , which is almost three million years had the size of 48 million years had the U.S. about 48 percent .
However , this subvalue the gravity of the problem because it doesn 't show the ice of the ice .
The arctic glacial hoods is , in a sense , the clear heart of the global climate system .
You go to the winter and you 're retired .
The next slide is going to be a quick related to the advanced the last 25 years .
The prayed glaces are red in red .
You can see , they expand until the blue wall .
That 's the ice in winter , which is retreatment of summer .
You can see that the cosidamage ice , of five years or more , is like blood , which is the blood , which is the blood , which is the blood , which is the blood , which is as a blood , which is like blood , which is the blood , which is like blood , which is the blood , which is the blood , which is the b
In 25 years , it 's gone from this , at the way .
This is a problem because the heat interest warming land around the sea glacier around the ocean where there are tremendous amounts of carbon congle , which , leaving , and then you turn into the microbes .
Right to the totality of the atmospheric ingenuus , that amount of of global warming , that could be dopacked , super-return .
In some of the laghi , in Alaska metane is already rebulting from water .
The professor of Alaska University of Alaska was actually taken with a team of a team of a team that was based on the winter .
Video : Wow ! Al Gore : Wow ! The question is well . The question is if we 're going to be .
A reason is that this termal exchange change Groenland from the northern .
This is a glacial regime .
The brought was never reached levels .
This is the Kangerlussuaq , in the southwest of Groenland .
If you want to know how the sea level for the sea path for the ice on the ground , here is where the sea .
These rents are increasing rapidly .
The other part of the planet : Antarctica , the largest block of the planet .
The month of the scientists have dichieve that the water that the ice is in negative , and that the Antarctde , which pogord on some submarine islands , is particularly quickly .
It 's about a miles a miles of the water , like Groenland .
Sull Himalayas , the third largest block of ice , you see new laghi , which few years ago ,
The 40 percent of the world population was going on half of the water from that melting .
Sulle Ande : this glacier is the source of this city .
The laid has increased .
But when it diminustrating the water is happening to the water .
In California , the snow on the Sierra Nevada is deminuity of 40 percent .
The idrices are in crisis .
The predictions , as you read , are good .
The growing secure for a remarkable of inceness .
The environmental disasters are increasing out of the normal and without precedented .
Four more numbers in the last 30 years , respect previous 75 .
This is a whole thing that is unsustainable .
If you look at the historical consequences if they can see the consequences .
In the last five years , we 've added 70 million tons of CO2 every 24 hours -- 25 million tons of the ocean every day .
Look at the area of the East Pacific , from the Americas , to the west , and in both of the parts of the Indian of the subst-poverty in the ocean .
The major of global warming , together with deforestation , which is 20 percent , is the fossil fuel use .
The oil is a problem , and the carbon is even worse .
The United States is one of the most emissions , together to China .
And it was proposition to build many other carbon carbon .
But we 're seeing a direction of the direction .
These are the anullated projects in the last few years and some green alternative of green alternative .
Everything , is a political fight in our country .
The carbon and the oil industry have spent 250 million dollars in the last year to promote carbon , which is a oxide , which is a oxygolden .
And that image reminded me something --
Verso , in Natal Tennessee , where I live , there 's been a loss of 3.8 billion pounds of carbon .
Maybe you 've seen it on news .
This is the second largest flussional floor in America .
It 's happened around Natal .
The nor advocused of one of the carbon industry was this .
Video : I 've been doing it , it 's a kind of allegrand happy .
It 's abundant here in America , and it grow our economic .
From carbon is the carbon is .
It 's good price , and the workers keep the stowned .
Al Gore : At here is a lot of the West Virginia .
The largest minerary society on the mountains is Massey Coal . This is his administrator .
Video : Don Blankenship : I 'll be clear -- Al Gore , Nancy Peleous , Harry Reid -- they don 't know what they 're talking about .
Al Gore : So the Alleance for the Clima has two campaign .
This is a one of them , a part .
Video : Acore : ALergy : ALergy , we see the climate change , as a sea as a serious sea in our business .
So , our priority is to invest a large amount of money in a effort to make public public and make the fur vertising vertisity on carbon .
In fact , carbon is not spring .
We think it 's clean -- it 's also a good profur .
So , not preocuse se of climate change .
Let 's do it to us .
Video : Actor : Carbone -- you 've heard a lot of it .
So let 's take a turn into a structure to the horg in the date of the pullit .
Straordinary ! The machines are a little rorous , but this is the sound of the pullit technology .
The carbon consumption is between the main causes of global warming , but the remarkable technology of the clean that you see changes everything .
Do a look : this is the odiergn of the clean technology .
Al Gore : finally , the positive alternative of the economic issue and the security of the national security .
Video : Comment : The America is in crisis ; the economy , the national security , the climate crisis .
The physical that connections all : our dependence from fossil fuel combustible , like the spring and oil .
Now , but , there 's a new , audace , audace ,
Repower : 100 percent of clean energy , in 10 years .
A piano to put America to work , make sure we make sure more surance , and to help stop the global warming .
And inally , a solution that is to solve our problems .
Repower . Scoprite more .
Al Gore : This is the last .
Video : How do it is to require energy to America .
One of the most fastest ways to bring the dependence of dependence that killing our planet .
Compars : The future is here . Sun , a new energy network .
Compars for 2 : Neggs for the investment of jobs .
Comment : Repower . It 's time to be realistic .
Al Gore : A old proverbio African says , " If you want to go fast , you go to fast .
If you want to go away , you go together . "
We have to go far , quickly .
Thank you very much .
LHC : LHC : A introduction on the LHC .
And promise to get back to how the machine works .
So here I 'm here . And for the one that time , the other time , the LHC is the largest scientific experiment I 've ever been trying -- 27 kilometers of circircircircircuit .
Her job is to rearing the conditions that were at less than a billion billion billion ardesimimate of the universe -- until 600 million times a second .
So , all that 's just ambiitious .
This is the machine under Ginevra .
We 're going to have these min-Big Bang inside the farmers .
This is what I work . It 's called ATLAS -- is about 44 feet and it 's got a diameter of 22 feet .
This is a spectacular picture of ATLAS in built on the proportions .
On the 10 settember last year , we put the machine for the first time .
And this picture was taken by ATLAS .
It was because of immense festegegatation in control .
It 's a picture of the first particles that had all done all the around the LHC , entering in collision , with a part of the LHC , and spread particularly , and spread particles in the back .
In other words , when we see that image 10 sleep , the way we found the machine worked , which is a great witten .
I don 't know if it was this to be exultless or this , when somebody went on on on Google and saw the page was this .
That means we have had a cultural impact on the scientific impact .
About a week later , there was a problem with the car , just had to these file files here -- these files .
These file files 13,000 amping when the machine works on the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the massive .
Now , the technique between you will look at the files and say , " It 's not true . I 'm so so sotremendous . "
And they can do it because when they 're very coxolers , they become the superconducting fixers .
So , at least 271 degrees , at a waste temperature in the space between stars , these files can bring that race .
In one of the giunture between the most novemile in the LHC , there was a defth of a fabrication .
So the file files , and the 13,000 amping suddenly , and the 13,000 print .
This was the result .
Now , this is more impressive if you think that these magnets fish more than 20 tons , and that have been moved about 30 initial .
They 're damaged about 50 magnets .
We had to take them , what we did .
We restined them and enjoyed .
Now they 're reback to their place .
By the end of the march the LHC is going to be new integral .
We 're going to accurate it , and we expect to get the data on the June or the bunch , and we 're going to go to what are the morning that are the universe .
Now , of course , in a way , these accidents retasting the debate on the value of science and engineering the value of science and engineering the front of science and engineering the front of the engineering of the value of science and engineering in front of science and engineering ering the value of science and engineering
I think the fact that the fact that it 's so hard , the fact that I think this is the value of things like LHC .
I would like to end with the words of a English scientist , Humphrey Davy , which , I imagine , in defense of inuseful experiments of his pupille , his Michael Faraday , his Michael Faraday , said , " Nient is so much dangerous for the progress of the human rators , which is not there are any any any new . "
Thank you .
I want to start to ask you about when , as children , as a children , played up with the morning .
And as you can understand them and make them , take them and get them , and move them , learn them , and you know , actually , learn how to think and solve problems with space .
The space reasoning is deeply connected to the way we understand a lot of the world around us .
So , from the inspired information to our own physical objects , together with my physical objects , together with my Pats , and my collaborator Jeevan Kalanithi , I started to ask myself , " And if we use a computer , rather than having the mouse as a computer , rather than having the by-up computer , we could actually trust a bunch of information with your hands ,
and how do it ?
The question was so interesting that we decided to explore the answer , building the answer , building the Siftable .
In a few words , a Siftable is a computer interactive as a biscoothing .
In a few words , a Siftable is a computer interactive as a biscoothing .
You can move them with their hand , can be , " see " between them , " between them , feel their movement and they have a screen and a wireless wireless .
But most importantly , I 'm physical objects , like the morning , you can move it simply to be able .
The Siftable is the example of a new tools of instruments to manipulate the digital information .
And as they become more physical , conscious of the right movement , of the other , and as they become more physical , and other , and how we die them , we can explore new things , we can explore new and fun and different styles of interaction .
I 'm going to start with some simple example .
This Siftable is configured to show video : if it 's going to hold it in a direction , the video is going to be so , if you 're going to go back .
These interactive rats are aware of of the other .
If you face them , they 're interested in what they 're all around .
If they 're circumdic , and they can do it a little bit .
If they 're circumdic , and they can do it a little bit .
They also have their movement and inches .
We then realized that one of the interests of the implications of the interaction was able to use managing for the data , for example , " a color as if it 's a liquid .
In this case , we have three Siftable configurate as bucks and I can use them to be pushing them to be fix in the central , where they missed .
and I can use them to do them to be able to fire the color , where you 're missing .
If we 're too much , we can put a little bit of place .
There are also beautiful possibility of learning , like the language , the language , the mathematics and logic games where people can try things things very quickly , and see the result of the immediately .
Now I 'm --
This is a Fibonaccount that I do with a equations of equations .
Here we have a game of words that is in the half between Scarabeo and Boble .
Pratically , at every turn-rich letter , in the Siftable , Pratically , at every Sifable , Pratically , at every Siftable of words , and as certain certain of words , and as you look at the words , he 's controls on a dictionary .
Then , after about 30 seconds you remissed , and you have a new letters to try .
Thank you .
Here 's the children came to the Media Lab , I 've done it so that I tried them and I went into a video .
They are very pleased .
And one of the things that kind of interesting things like this applies is that not to give people a lot of instructions .
You 've got to say , " Compons of words , and they know exactly what to do .
Here is other people try it .
This is our younger tester tester , there on the right .
It actually wanted to be just to impilling them .
They only were morning in the morning ,
Now , this is a appliation of a interactive charge .
We wanted to build a device for the apprentice of the language is Felix .
It can put the characters in the scene , by by by by by by by the Siftable .
It can put the characters in the scene , by by by by by by by the Siftable .
So , it 's doing the sun .
Video : The sun is source .
David Merrill : Now it 's led a herself in the back .
Video : The arangue treatment .
Bel work ! Yeah !
So , by the Siftable and put them neighbors can get the characters --
Video : Bau !
-- by inventing their story .
Video : Hi !
DM : It 's a story with the open , and he can decide him how it fly .
DM : It 's a story with the open , and he can decide him how it fly .
Video : Vola on , yes .
DM : The last example I have time to show you is a device , is a device , to track and executive music .
It 's a instrument , which is a deal , to tramples and exeguing music .
The Siftable here are being on the sounds like the bass and the battery .
Each one of these has four different variations , and you can choose what to use .
You can also put these sounds into a sequence to get your pleasure .
And it just to do it by doing a sound and a sequence .
These are actually , you can control from the vial , as the reverbero and filter .
The acks to a particular sound and then inclens for them .
And then there are the general effects as time and volume , which is applied to the sequence .
Let 's look at how it works .
Video : DM : We 're going to start putting a base in two Siftable sequence , we put it in a series , we put it in a series , we add the other base .
Now I put a bass line .
Video : DM : Now , I add percussions --
Video : DM : And I 'm going to put the filter in the bacteria , so I can control the effect of the face .
Video : DM : I can be able to be the way of the way or the other .
Video : DM : And I 'm going to add the bass to give more expression .
Video : DM : I can recombine the sequence of the flying .
So I don 't have to plan it before , but I can suddenly make it , make it over the most cord .
And now , finally , I can spend the whole sequence on the left the Siftable .
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is to build new mo-similar mo-machine interfaces as our brain and body .
And today , I 've had time to show you one of the result of this path , and even some possibility that we try to bring from the lab .
The concept I want to transmit is that 's coming up this new generation of designed to interact with digital media , which will bring information in our world in the way we want .
Thank you very much .
I don 't see the time to talk to everybody .
They 're a writer .
I think I 'm going to caught up , but it 's more than this , of course .
It 's also love and the fascination of my life .
And I don 't expect that it can change .
But , this is something particular happened in my life and in my career , which has led me to recalibrate the entire relationship with this work .
The particular thing is that I 've been wrote this book , this biography called " Mangia , Prega , Ama , " which , diversly from my prevision , and it became a great , bestseller , and it became a great great , bestseller , the interational ,
And the result is that everywhere , people treatment is that they 're convicted .
Can you -- that 's convicted .
They 're all worried to me and they say , " Do you have no longer to do better ?
Do you don 't have fear to continue to write the whole life without being able to create a book that can be important to someone ? "
What can you be to someone ? "
It 's certaintainly , you know .
But it may go worse , part of the one I remember that I remember that over 20 years ago , when I started to say to people -- I was a tearing -- I wanted to be a track .
I would put it in the same reaction that was based on the fear .
And people said , " Don 't you know , " I don 't have succeeded ?
Do you don 't have fear that the umillion killed you ?
Do you don 't care of this windoor to the whole life , without nothing out of it out and die on a cumulation of a remule with the bits of the bunch of the mobile pive cuts ? "
So , you know .
The answer to all of these questions is , " Yes . "
Yes , I 'm fear of all those things .
I 've always been fear .
And I 'm also fear of many other things that people may not inguish .
As the algae and other things .
But , for the about the write what I thought and I was just wondering what I thought and I was that ?
Is it rational ?
It 's logical that anyone who has to wait to be spent by a job that you 've been born to do .
But what is that particular in the creative impressive , to make us nervous mental health care .
How my father , for example , he was a chemist engineer and not remember one time in his 40 years of the activity that was asked if he was doing it .
There was never -- that block of the engineer John , how does it happen ?
Don 't it work like that , right ?
Onestly , chemical engineers like group have not certainly , in the centuries , in the centuries , guadvanced the reputation of being alcoded .
We writers , we have enough to do this reputation , and not just writers , but creativity of every kind , we have this reputation of being enormous .
And it 's not to look at the sad of the magnifeth of the magnifeth magnifments that , only in the 20th century , they die young and often .
And even the ones that don 't have been suicians seem to be really disfacing from their dones .
Norman Mailer , before he died , in the last interview said , " Every book killed me a little more " more " an extraordinary affermation about the work of their life .
But we don 't do it by the way we heard these things so long that we 've heard these things so long that somehow we 've been interiorized and accepted the notion that creativity and suffering are somehow tired and that art , in the end , it 's going to be a bunch .
And the question that I want to take everyone here today is : are you agree with this idea ?
You know , this thing -- because even looking at the one centimeter of the distance to me , it 's not good for this support .
I think it 's horrise .
And I think it 's dangerous and I don 't want to see the perpetuate in the next century .
I think it 's better encouraging our big creative minds .
And I certainly know , in my case -- in my situation -- it would be very dangerous to start founding towards that suddenly suppointed the circumstances in which I 'm in my career .
That 's really -- I mean , I 'm pretty young , I 'm pretty young , I have about 40 years .
I 've got about four work decades of work in me .
And it 's very likely that everything I 'm going to be right now , as the work that came out of the world as the work that came out of my last book .
I 'm going to be slaveef , because we 're all more or friends here -- it 's likely that my greatest succeeds .
Oh , Gesus , who thought !
You know , this is the kind of thought that leads a person to start to drink in the morning and I don 't want to do it .
I would keep going to continue to do this work that we do .
So , the question becomes , how ?
And so it seems to me , after many reflections , which the way to work to continue to write is to create a psychological construct , OK ?
I have to find a security between me , which is a distance between me , which I 'm write , and my natural anxime , which is going to be able to get out . And as I was looking for all the last year , trying to find other society , trying to find other society to see if they could have better ideas and better healthy and see if they could have have better ideas and more healthy ideas and look at the time ,
about how to help people make the inerent risks of emotivity .
And that research led me to the Grek and the Rome .
Seguitegen me because it 's about it in circle and then it 's back .
In the ancient Grek and ancient Rome -- people didn 't seem to believe that creativity self-invent men , OK ?
And it was thinking that creativity was this exploring , and that they come to men from men from a few people distant and unknown , for distant reasons and known , for distant reasons .
The Great grew of the spiriters of creativity " demand . "
Socrate , wonderful , believed that he had a demon the wisdom that was remote .
The Rooms were the same idea , but called the " Ir. "
which is great , because Rooman didn 't think that a genius was a special genius was somebody particularly intelligent .
They believe that a genius was this kind of a divine of the indeed of an artist study of a artist , a little like the elpho Dobby , and that was in the elpho Dobby , and that was in the middle of the hidden job of the artist and models the result of that work .
Here 's the same -- that 's the distance of which I talk about -- that psychological construct that you protected your work .
And everybody knew that it was so that it worked , right ?
So , the antiks were protected by certain things , like , for example , the too much narcism , not ?
If your work was exceptional , you can 't take all the place , you know , you know , you know , you 've been helped by this genius .
If your failure , it 's not all of your failure , right ?
Everyone knew that it was your genius to be a incapable .
And so people han conceived creativity in Occide for a long time .
And then the Rinches came and everything changed , and it 's all this big idea ; we put the human being over the universe on the center of the universe .
This was the rational principle and people started thinking that creativity was completely from the issue of the rational isse .
And for the first time in history , you start refly to this or artist as a genius rather than one person with genius .
And I have to tell you , I think it was a big mistake .
I think I allow someone , a simple person to believe that that we 're like a recipient as a recipient as a recipient of all the mysteries , creativity , inknowable and etheran is a responsibility of a file , too big to give to the fragile of human psychologists .
It 's like to ask someone to inguish the sun .
Deform and destores that completely the ego and creates all these inexible expectations on performance .
And I think it was this pressure that I 've been destroyed in the 500 years .
And if this is true , and I think it 's true , and I think it 's the question , and now ?
Can we do that diversity ?
Maybe you can go back to a more old understanding of the relationship between humans and creative .
Or not .
Maybe we can 't docell 500 years of rational thinking in a 18 minutes .
And there is probably people in the audience that would be legitimate sospects on the notion of , insuspect , they do that people are doing so on their projects .
I 'm probably not sure everybody about this .
But the question I would like to ask is -- why not ?
Why don 't it think about this way ?
Because it 's more sense of everything that has ever heard of it to explain the exabove the redication of the creative process .
A process that , as anyone who ever tried to do something -- so , that 's really , all here -- you don 't know rationally , you know , you know ,
And , in fact , it can sometimes seem completely paranormal .
I did this meeting with the recently Ruth Stone , who has now 90 years , but he 's got a poetry for the whole life of life and said that during his infancing in the rural Virginia , and he felt out in the camps , and he felt it , in the if a poem came from the landscape .
He said that it was like a frageous train .
And that was coming rotolding to her from the landscape .
He felt that , because he was to tremendous the earth under his feet .
He knew I had one thing to do that point and it was , words , " run as a math . "
And it 's going to hold it , and it 's been on this poetry , and it wouldn 't have to get a piece of paper and a math enough enough , and it was recovering it , and they were wrong with it .
Sometimes I couldn 't be enough enough to be fast enough , so it 's correcreceive and he wouldn 't get in the house and the roolar , and she loved them and she loved it and she loved it and she loved it and she loved it and she loved it , " another poet . "
Then there were those times -- this piece of the time I 'm not going to say -- there were moments in which the almost lossing , OK ?
So , it was running home and she was trying to do the card and the poem was looking at the time , and she was going to go , and then she said , which was how if you 're sungled with the other hand and the coffee .
It was going to cause the poem from the code and put it on his body and transclumn it on the page .
And in these cases , the poem would be presented on the perfect page , and the last word to the first one .
So when I heard it , I felt , it 's exactly exactly the same same as my creative process .
Not all my creative process -- I 'm not a conviction !
I 'm a mulo , and my way to work is ; I wake up to the same oran orary every day and work and pass and work and pass up .
But even I have in my aggin , I 've been striped against that thing , sometimes .
And I guess that many of you , I guess that .
You know , even if the work and ideas came to me from a certain source , I can 't know it .
And what is this ?
And how can we relate it to us to do it , but rather , what do we do is , but rather , what does it remaining us ?
As it 's about , the best example of the most contemporary example I have is the musicist Tom Waits , which I 've interviewed different years ago for a newspaper .
We were talking about this , and you know , Tom , for the majority of life is the incarnation of the incarnation of the temporary article , trying to control these species of impulses .
But then he got invent , he calculated , and one day as he was driving on a car in Los Angeles , he changed everything for him .
It was going to be able to be able to be a little bit of a melody fragment , which comes in his head as the inspiration , and it wants , and it wants , you know , it 's wonderful , and the desider knows how to take it .
It 's not a paper , it 's not a math , it 's not a math , it 's not a math ,
So , I started to feel this kind of old species growing up in this guy , " I 'm going to lose , and I 'm going to hold , and I 'm going to hold it .
I 'm not good enough and I can 't do it . "
And instead of going to go to the panic , you stop .
He 's going to put the whole process of mental and made something completely new .
He just looked at the sky and said , " Scause , I 'm not driving ? "
" To you look like a setting now ?
If you really want to exist , you 're going to get me more opporting me .
Other one , you go to be qualcut of the other today .
You know , the Leonard Cohen . "
And his process changed after this .
Not the work , the work , it was still dark .
But the process , and the heavy anxiety that was attended up when the genius , the genius that was caused by the other problems and the genius that was going to be , and then get it back from where it was , realizing that it didn 't have to be a whole thing and hored .
but you know this peculiar , wonderful bizarre collaboration between Tom and this strange and this external thing that was not Tom .
So , how much that story was going to change a little bit even the way I was working and I was already saved .
This idea , I was saved when I was write " Mangia , Prega , Ama , and fall in one of those cave disperation where we 're doing on something and we can 't start to do it and you 're not going to be able to think that it will be a disaster , which is going to be a disaster , which is going to be the worst book .
Not just bad , just the worst book .
And I started thinking about giving this project .
But then I remember Tom , which was talking about the air and you try to it .
So I raised my face on the dark and diressed my common a bunch of the room .
And I said to high voices , " Sup-, what , you 're going to be the ones that are not going to be brilliant , not going to be brilliant , not ?
Because as I see I 'm putting everything I have , I don 't have this .
So if you want to be better , you have to be a better , you have to be your side .
OK . But if you don 't do it , you know what , I don 't do it .
I 'm going to write the same because it 's my work .
And I want to do my part of the world , I 've presented that I 've presented to do my part , " Because -- at the end is so , OK -- -- in the end of the North Africa people were unring out of the damances of the dance of the dances of the dances of the bunch of the dances of the dances of the moon and to the stuff .
And they were always magnify , because the ballerins were great .
But every time , rarely , something happened , and one of these artists became really transcending .
And I know what I know , because I know you 've all seen it , at a point , a performance like this .
It was like the time , and the dancing walk through a kind of land-up , and it was not doing anything different from the solved , as the 1,000 noticing before , but all it was all on .
And suddenly , it doesn 't look at just like a human .
But it 's on the diinside and it 's illuminated in the fire of divinity .
And when this happened , in the time , people knew what it was , they called him .
They had their hands and began to sing , " Allah , Allah , Allah , God , God God , " God , " God , " God , " God , " God , "
That 's God , you know .
Curious note -- when the Morr. invaded the southern Spain , I got this habits and the prevent of them and the prevent , and the prevent , the " Ole , " the " Ole , " the " two , which you can feel in the corrids or in the flamp in the flamp .
In Spain , when a artist did something impossible and magical , " Allah , " Allah , " Allah , " Brace , " incomprehensive , " To , " " is a last of God .
And it 's great because we need .
But , the problem , it comes the day after , the dancer , and it 's the time , and discovering that are the 11 of Martedday and God 's last 11 morning and the last of God , and it 's not .
It 's just a mortal with gran bad kink , and maybe it 's going to be able to make that height to that height .
And maybe nobody 's going to go to the name of God , and what is it to do with the rest of his life ?
It 's hard .
This is one of the most painful recognized painful to a creative life .
But maybe it doesn 't have to be so anguiling if you can 't believe , as well , which is most extraordinary aspects of your being from yourself .
But you might just believe that they 're being data in prested by a inimaginable source of this team that you have to go to someone else when you finished .
And , you know , if we think it 's all changes .
And so I started thinking , and it 's certainly how I thought I think of it for different months in the work of the book that I 'm going to be on , the dangerous , attesissim , attesissues followed my my green success successentially .
And what I 'm going to continue to me when I feel electric .
Not just forced . It 's just your work .
Continua presentation of your side , any of your own part ,
If your work is dancing , it 's dancing .
If the divine , as you know , it 's assigned decide to leave some of a few kinds of wonderful , for one moment through your effort , then " Ole . "
Or you do that your dance .
And " Ole ! " You know it .
I think , and I think , I think , I should teach it .
" Ole ! " to you yourself , even for having had their human and testing aggin tals to make you continue to be able to present you .
Thank you .
Thank you .
June Cohen : Ole !
As you know I 've already talked about some of these projects on the human genome , what can mean , and on the discovery new set of genes .
Now we 're starting a new persual . We started to digitize biology and now now we 're going to go into a new phase of biology , design and design and synthesizing and synthesizing life .
We always tried to ask great questions .
What is life ? " What is life ? " It 's something that many biologists have tried to understand many levels .
We 've tried different approaches , reduced it to the minimum .
We 're digitizing from almost 20 years .
When we sequenced the human genome was , it was going to go from the analog of biology in the world .
Now we ask us : can regenerate life , or to create new life from this digital universe ?
This is the map of a little organism , the Mycoplasm genyum , which is the species from the smallest genome between those who can authorem in the lab .
And we tried to reduce ulteriorly the genome to create one more smaller .
We can get a hundred of genes of the genes of about 500 .
But when we look at his metabolic map , it 's relatively simple than our own .
" " " " " This is simple .
But when we look at all of the genes that we can eliminate , one at the time , it 's very unlikely that this can bring to a living cells .
So we decided that we could be synthesize this chromosome in a way that could be able to modify the components to bring some of these fundamental questions .
So , we started the adventure of the " Can . " Can we can synthesize a chromosome ? "
Can the chemistry to make these big molecules that we never have to create before ?
And in case , in the case , can we make a chromosome ?
A chromosome is just a piece of the inert material .
The speed that we 're captured to digitize life is growing up to exponential .
Our capacity to write the genetic code , rather slowly , but it 's improving .
And our most recent results the exponential curve .
We started over 15 years ago .
The process required many steps , starting with bioethical required first experiments .
But we found that synthesize is very hard .
There are tens of thousands of cars in the world that make little segments of DNA , over 30-length , and it 's a degenerative process : the longer is that we have .
So we had to develop a new method to assembly these framments and correcting the mistakes .
And this was our first attempt , to go out to digital information of the Phi X Jun-174 .
It 's a little virus that kills .
We designed the fragments , actually , the rules of the mistakes and get a molecule of DNA molecule .
The interesting part is when we got this piece of the inert material inert , and we put it in the bacteria , the bacteria have started reading this genetic code and produring the viral particles .
The viral particularly , they 've been released by the cell , they 've been back and they destroyed the Eccles .
I 've talked to recent with the oil industry , and they 're certainly saying that they have certainly compressed this model .
They 've been reward to you .
We believe that this is a situation where the software can really build his same hardware in a biological system .
But we wanted to do things larger .
We wanted to build the entire chromosome of the bacteria .
They 're over 580 mile thousand letters of genetic code .
So we thought we build it in cassets of the virus , so that we can change the cassets that are the components of a living cells .
The design is crucial , and if we start with digital information in a computer , these must be very accurate .
When we sequenced this genome for the first time in 1995 , the standard accurate standard was a mile for every 10 thousand .
We found that , we resequenced it , 30 errors . If we had that original sequence we never have been able to do it work .
One part of the process is to design a 50 lecture that is a long time for all the other 50 letters to make subunity smaller than working on the subunity of building subunity smaller than working together .
We try to be unique elements here .
You probably read that we 're going to read that we 're going to be in the magnnine .
So , think , we have a genetic code on four letters : Actually , CEEO and Ts .
Three of those letters put together together with about 20 friend of these things , and there 's a specific order to read for every friend .
So we can use genetic code to write words , frases , which is thinking .
What we did in the beginning is autographed it .
Some of them have been delusers from the fact that it wasn 't poetry .
We designed these segments to only only only to join in the enzymes .
There are me that they repair them and put them up .
And we started to assembly , starting with segments , starting with five to seven thousands , unenders , unenders in a way that forming segments in their time until it 's 72 mile mile , they had to 72 mile .
So , in the way , we made these segments in abundance so that we 're trying to create an extremely robustoking -- as you see in a minute .
We 're trying to automatize the process .
So , this seems the tabellon a basket player .
When we get these very long , more than 100 mile , over 100 mile , they 're not going to grow more directly in E.
You get to the limit of modern biology tools .
So we 've been considered other mechanisms .
We knew about another mechanism called recombination omologue , which in biology is useful to repair the DNA to only the segments .
Here 's an example .
This organism , called Deinooococcus radiodurans , can absorb three million radioduring .
You can see in the upper square as his chromosome of the crumosome .
In 12 -- 24 hours , it 's reassembly as it was .
There are thousands of organisms that they can do it .
These organisms can sit completely .
They can live under empty .
They 're absolutely sure that life existing in space , and you feel to find new riches of water .
In fact , NASA showed this that this is .
This is a picture of molecule we built these processes , just using these processes , just using the likely to design appropriate ,
The lights assemble them .
This picture is not taken with a microscope , but with a microscope , but with a microscope .
It 's a molecule that we can see it with a microscope .
These are pictures that cost a time of about six seconds .
This is the advertising that we 've done a little time ago .
They 're over 580,000 letters of genetic code .
It 's the largest molecule of a defined structure .
It 's a 300 million or 300 million .
If we stammed it with a cartoon of 10 without spaces , it would like 142 page to transcent this genetic code .
Now , how do we do it ? How do we activate it ?
Of course , you 're tramed a virus is a game .
It 's a little bit more complicated when you use bacteria .
It 's simpler as much as it is the eucariote like our , it 's just the nucleo and insert another , which is basically the process of cloning .
In the bacteria , the chromosome is in the cell , but we recently demonstrated that we 're able to do a complete transplant of a cell cell on another and to activate it .
We clear a chromosome from a microbial species .
The two are different as men from the topes .
We added some gene gene more that we can decide what to this chromosome .
The skid , with the enzymes , so that you can kill all the proteins .
And when we put it in the cell was stupendowny -- and you 're going to be our sophisticatooes -- the new chromosome -- the new chromosome .
And we started thinking that we couldn 't go beyond , but we 've been trying to push us out there .
This is one of the major mechanisms of evolution .
We found that a lot of anti-species have added a second or a chromosome , in a second , added in a thousand tracks in a second .
So who think about evolution as a gene and at the time you 're going to be a lot of biology .
They have been called the restressition of restrition , which I know , they 're going to type the DNA .
The chromosome that was in the cell not one .
The cell phula-the cross-down that we put it .
It expressed , and it recognized the other cross-cross-crossed material , it 's got it , and we 've been found with only the cell and the new chromosome .
It became blue because of the genes we put in .
And in a short , all the characteristic of a species , I went to perse , and it turned out in a new species , based on the new software that we 've inserted in a cell .
All the property has changed , the members have changed , and when we read the genetic code , exactly what we 've transferred to you .
Now , this may seem to be genetic alchemy genetic alcheef , but by altering the software , we can change things in a fairly .
Now , I 've already explained that it 's not about genesis -- but to progress from three million years and a half of evolution , and I 've already said that maybe we 're going to create a new version of Cambrian explosion in which will be created new species on this digital process .
Why do that ?
I think it 's pretty obvious when we think about our necessity .
We 're going to move from six and a half billion people in the next 40 years .
Right for an example : I 'm born in 1946 .
Now there are three people on the planet for each one existing in 1946 .
We 're having problems now to find food , fresh water and clean , medical and wealth for six and a half billion people .
It 's going to be even more than that .
We use more than five billion carbon , more than 30 billion carbon ,
That means a hundred of millions of barrel a day .
When we try to find biological processes , or all kinds of process to replacing them , it 's going to be a huge challenge .
We have to be more to deal with all of CO2 to these materials that end up in the atmosphere .
At day today , because of the scientific discoveries in the world , we have a database with about 20 million genes , and I like to think that are the designed components for the future .
The electronic industry only one dozen of the components , and think about how many different things are coming out .
Our limitations are constantly from the reality and our imagination .
Now we have some techniques , because of these quick methization , in order to create what we call combinatory genomics .
We can build a big robot that can make a big robot that can produce a million cross a day .
Think of processing these 20 million genes or to get to get the processes to make eight or drugs , new vaccines , or nearly , new vaccines , we can change , because of a little team , and create more biology molecular biology now in the last 20 years of science .
And it 's just a standard selection .
We can choose for survival , chemical production or carbon , or carbon production ,
This is a moment of some software programmed that we 're working on to be able to be able to figure out and design species to make us design species .
Well , we don 't know how it will be .
We know exactly how they are their genetic code .
Now we 're focusing on the fourth generation of the carbon .
You saw you that that extracted from the grant was a finial experiment .
We have carbon on , and third generation that will be done enough from the sugardening in the higher value of higher value as the eight-types of butanol .
But the only way that biology can have a big impact without increasing more about food , and then limitaren the cost of food and limitarne the cost of the CO2 in matter before , where we 're working on design cells that can reach the cell that to design cells that can reach , and we think we have the first carbon of the next 18 months .
The soldilight with CO2 is a metodo-- but in our discoveries in the world , we 've found different metods .
This is a organism that we 've described in 1996 .
It 's about 2,000-footprint in the deep ocean temperature .
They create metane from CO2 using molecular hydrogen energy .
We 're trying to figure out if we can incanalate CO2 , which can easily be transported through the CO2 in carbon , to drive this process .
So , short think we could be able to increase what the basic question of what is the basic question of " which is Noi , real , real mode goal of replacing the oil oil industry .
Exactly . If you don 't do that from TED , where can ?
It would be a main energy source .
And also , we 're working on the same metods to to create instantane-wild vaccines .
You saw this year with flu , we 're always going back to a year and with a dollar in the right .
I think what you can change by building combinable vaccines in tinable vaccines .
And that 's how the future may be changing , now , the tree of evolution , accelling evolution with the synthetic bacteria , archy , archen , and finally initially cell eucariote .
We 're so much from the improve people .
Our purpose is to do it , so long enough to try to do it . Thank you very much .
First of all of you , I 'll do you see , the most quickly possible , some fundamental work , the new technology that we 've taken Microsoft in a year ago . This is exactly Seadragon . This is Seadragon .
It 's a environment where you can interact is on the local level that you can interact with a huge amount of visual data .
Here we 're seeing a lot of digital pictures with a kind of a photos of a sustaining , and it 's a kind of a panoramic fast , and we have the imagery as we want .
And it doesn 't matter how much much much information that we see , how big information that we see , how big these things are great data or the images .
Most are common photographs , but this for example , is a scanning from the Library of the Congress , and reenters in the Congress of 300 megapiel .
It doesn 't make any difference because the only thing that 's the prestations of a system like this is the number of your pixel on your screen in your screen in any time . It 's a very flexible architecture .
This is a book , like , of the data not imagery .
This is the Casa desolate of Dickens . Every colonna represents a capol .
To show you that it 's just about it and not imagery , we can do something like that , to actually see that it 's a real real representation of the text , not a picture .
It may be a way a little artificial to read a electronic book .
Don 't you consider it .
This is a more realistic example . It 's a number of the Loowner .
Every picture is the beginning of a section .
And it really gives you the pleasure and the beautiful experience of the real version cartoon version of a magazine , which is for a molteplant , which is for a molteplant .
We also did something with the angle of this particular number of the Ladian .
We created a higher advanced highly resolutionary -- much more higher than what you use in a normal advertising -- and we 've been inserted .
If you want to see the characteristic of this automobile , you can see here .
Or other models , or even the specific techniques .
And this really shows some of these ideas to eliminating the limits of space on the screen .
We hope that that that means to put it in the pop-up and other porcheries , not to be .
Of course , the map is one of the most obvious applications for this kind of technology .
And I don 't want to lose time , if we don 't know that we have contribute to give them in this field .
These are all the streets in the U.S. sovrappy on the NASA .
So now we go to something else .
This is actually actually , the way I 'm on the web ; you can go to see it .
It 's a project called Photosynth , which combine two different technologies .
One is Seadragon and the other is a visual research in the computer that made by Noah Snavely , a student of the University of Washington , with the aid of Steve Seitz 's Seitz and Rick Seitz Seitz 's Seitz . "
And it 's from the Web , managon from Seadragon .
You can see it when we do this kind of screaming , where we can go from one image to the other and have this kind of experience to the other thing .
But the space collocation of the images here has actually a meaningful .
The algorithms of the computer visualization have been recorded these images together , so that they 're all linked to the real places that I imagine them -- all of these things are scaten . And so on the way you can see -- all the way of a slides , and these things are all of the things that are in the destable or of imaging , and these things are all in the space .
I don 't know if I have time to show you some other environment .
There are some more spacecraft .
I want to move directly to one of the original data from Noah-- and this is from a previous prototype of Photosynthy that we 've done for the first time last summer -- to show you what we 're really going to do this to be the first time , the back of this technology , the Photosychchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchchroys .
We had to worry about legal aspects of the legal aspects and on .
This is a re-built of the cattedral of Notre Dame images in Flickr . Basta digitness Notre Dame in Flickr and you get images of types in magic , and on the campublics and on . Oach one of these conies , this picture that is discovered to this model .
So they are all images from Flickr and they 've been all connected to this way .
And it 's possible to navigate this very simpissional way .
You know , I would never have thought of end up to work for Microsoft .
It 's very gratefiying to receive this kind of acades here .
I think you can see that it 's a lot of different types of different kinds of footos : from those of the SLR , a significant number of things that SLR , a meaningful number .
And if I can , I try to look for those strange .
Many of them are stuck , etc .
Somewhere you have a series of photographs -- here 's a series of photographs -- here .
This is a poster of Notre Dame recorded Dame correctly .
We can go from the poster to the physics of this environment .
The essential point is that we can do things with social environment . This is now taking data from properties of how to apply the Earth 's interest , from the standing point of visual view -- and connections -- and connections of all those data together .
All those pictures become connected together , largely , more than the sum of the parts .
You have a model of the land that emerging .
Think about this as a prolungation of Stephen Lawler on Earth .
It 's something that grows in complexity as people use it , and which people use it , and which advantages to people use it .
Their pictures are husers with other people .
If you get somebody 's the idea of contrast all these sunning , saying the name of Notre Damamn unseen , my cattedral of all those data , and I can use how much of those data , and I can use how to be used to be emgerms in that space , in that metapuniverse , using the red red by the way , and having a red cross-user experience of the red , and by the cross-user .
Of course , a consequence of all this is very virtual models of every part of the Earth , and it 's not just about it .
Thank you .
Chris Anderson : I understand ? What your software is going to be doing is that that you 're going to be doing is that at a certain point , in the next years , all of the photographs are going to be connected together ?
BAA : Yes . What 's doing is doing is actually discovered .
It 's creating hyperlink , if you want , between imagery .
And it 's in the basket of images .
The thing becomes very interesting if you think about wealth of the semantic information that many of these images are possible .
As you do a picture of the web , you have a phrase on the web page has a lot of information about the web has a lot of information about the picture .
Now , what happens if that picture you 're connecting to all your photos ?
So the amount of semantic connections and the amount of richness that it 's really huge . It 's a classical classical . It 's a classical classical .
CA : Blaise , it 's really amazing . Compedents .
BAA : I thank you very much .
One of the main pleasure , when you travel and one of the ethrows of ethrows , is the way to live between who has not forgotten 't forgot antial the traditions , between who has the past , it 's the stone of the stone of the plants .
Bastes think that the chiamans Jaguar vision still beyond the Vy , or that the monitites , or that the advanced the Dharm , or in Himalayas , the buddists actually slumers follow up the respire of the anthropology , and the idea that the world in which we live not exist in sense , but it 's only a model , but it 's only a model ,
the consequence of a particular adaptative of a particular adaptative choices that our stones did , well .
And , of course , we all share of the essential traits .
We all go .
We 're subjects to start .
We need to death the inexorability of death , so we don 't surprising if we 're going to focus and whom we 're --
We all have a art .
What it does is the particular rhythm of the song , the rhythm of dance .
It doesn 't matter that they are the rainforests of the Borneo , or the following Vodoo 's the Kenya , or the deserrial Kenya , or the gain of the Ande , or a settle-to-in Sahara .
He was my journey in the desert a month ago , or a yak , or a yak in the yak of Qomolangme , on the Everest , the Everest , the Everest , the dey of the world .
All of these populations teachers us that there are other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , other ways of moving in the world .
And if you think , if you think , it 's a concept that it can give you hope .
In the world , together , the myriades of the world , they create a spiritual life and is important for the well-being of the planet and is important for the benefit of the planet , so as the ragnote as a biosphere .
And you can think of this cultural ragnostic , as a throwd , and you can call the thror the thnosphere , and the inspired , the idea , dreams , and intuitions , intuitions , intuitions , intuition , in being of being from the human imagination from the alone of the consciousness .
The etnosphere is the fantastic patriage of humanity .
It 's the symbol of what we 're and what we can be in how much species inquisitive .
And because biosphere was very much consumption has been consumed as as as a baby , and unfortunately , and unfortunately ,
Nothing biologist , for example , it would say that 50 percent of all species is on the orders simply because it 's fake , or -- in the most apocalyptic -- in the most apocalym -- in the field of biological diversity -- and it 's not close to the most optimistic ispocalm -- that of the cultural diversity .
The index of all , of course , the language loss .
When you were born 6,000 language on this planet .
One language is not only composed by a vocabulary or by a series of rules .
One language is the human spirit of the human spirit .
It 's the middle of which the animal of every culture , it 's in the material .
Every language is a forest , a forest , a backin , a spiritual possibility of spiritual possibility .
And those 6,000 languages , as we 're in Monterey , at least half the way , it 's not soon as much as it 's been in the children .
They 're not taught to children , which means , unless that bees , which is not not something that they 're already death .
What is more sad than being made by the silence , of being the last talking to a language , the way of being the wisdom of the saggeity of the sitness of the children , or to anticipate the promise of the children ?
This orring is the state of someone in the world every two weeks , every two weeks , a managed muor and he 's got in the last silver and door with the old silly .
And I know somebody who will say , " isn 't it better ?
The world is not a better place if I talk all the same language ? " Benissim , then we talk all talk about yoruba .
We talk about kogue .
You 're going to be a sudden thing that 's not to talk about their language .
I 'd like to do a trip through the thnosphere --
a little journey in the etnosphere to give you a bunch of what we 're losing .
Many of us forget that when I say , " different ways of existing , " I mean , really different ways of exists .
We take for example this baby Barasana , in Amazonia , the anacond people , the anacond the anaond of the east in the west painting of the west in the west snars in the west snacone-waste sacone-waste ,
It 's a people who is not able to distinguish the color of the green from the green because the time you 've been identified in the forest , which depends on the popular .
They have a strange language and a matrimonial , called the " exogamia " : you have to marry a person who talks about a different language .
And it all has radical in the past mitologic , though the particular particular particular , is that in these families , where they 're talking about six or seven language .
They 're going to listen and then they start talking .
We take one of the most interesting tribe with which I 've lived , the Waorani of Ecuador north , a popular that has the first conducts in 1958 .
In 1957 missionaries have been trying to make a mistake .
They did down the top photographs that they found them in the front of them , which was going to be friendly , and forest that this popular forest .
They talked to the earth of the earth , they went to the research of a shape or a figture and , not finding anything , they were going to be the deaths of the hell , and they killed the five missionaries with the launch .
But the Waorans don 't kill only the foreign .
They killed between them .
On 54 percent of mortality was caused by their own .
We 're going to eight generations and we found two death of the natural death and when we 've been insisted to know , they had a lot of them was invectured so that he 's dead , and then killed him him .
The hunters were able to recognize the 40 of the animal urine steps and recognize the species .
In the early 1980s , I 've been assigned a really interesting task when my Harvard professor , if I wanted to go to Harvard , I was assigned between the secret of the power of Duvalier and Tonton Macoalth , and impossessing about the areas .
To make sense of the myracolost , I should have understand the Vodoun culture , and the Vodoo is not magic .
It 's rather about a complex metaphysical vision of the world .
Very interesting .
If I asked you to tell you the big religions of the world , what would you like ?
Cristianism , Islam , Buddism , Ebraism , etc .
A continent is always left , thinking that the sub-Saharan Africa has no feeds of religious . And they and yes and Vodoo Vodoo is not the other than the distilside of these religious concepts in the tragic conflict of slavery .
What makes the interesting voodoo is the intending between life and death .
So , the magazine they have to be the spirites .
The spirits can be invoced by the Great Acqua , they response to the dance of the dance and they replace temporally at the soul of the vial way that for a short moment , that is the following becomes the goal .
So , for this voodooists , " You white white you go to talk about God .
We give God in the time and we become God . "
And from the moment you 're in a marrit , is the spirit that you 're driving it , how can you do bad ?
So you can see these incredible events : follow voodoo in the state of trance that touches touches up a rather forced demonstration of the power of the mind when it 's catalyzed in a state of extreme ,
In all the populations with which I 've been lived the most extraordinary Kogi of Sierra Nevada , in the Santa Marta , in Colombia .
Do the ancient civilization of the antial civilizations that once they lived on the caraibia , in the people 's playing on the conqueren massive , which is the people were on the security of the conquulcanic planning .
In a continent drug continent , this people has never been conquisted by the Spanish .
But they 're governed by a clero , but their formation is so extraordinary .
The young people following them are taken out of the families to three or four years , and they live secrew in a world that 's made of buy and hombs in the bottom of the ice for 18 years .
Two of nine years of the way to reproduce the nine months of management that transmanagement in the users of the mother , they 're now methaphorically in the uteral Grande Mother .
For all of this time , they 're acculturate to the society , values that predict that their prayers and only their prayer , and only their prayer , or to say the best balance .
At the term of this incredible initiation , they 're suddenly taken out and for the first time in their 18 years , at the age of 18 years , they see a alba . And in that active consciousness of the first buts , when the sun sun is the value of the beautiful waste . And in this remamamain theory . The prete a pass back and it 's saying , and it 's saying , and it 's saying , and it 's saying , and it 's saying ,
" Do you ? I mean , how I said .
It 's amazing . Now it 's great to you protect it . "
They call them as much as the most of the ones , and they say that we , the minors of the destruction of the world .
This level of intuition is extremely important .
When we think of Ingene and the environment of the Rousseau and the old story of the noble story , which is a razen concept in his noble concept in his simplicity in his simplicity in his simplicity or maybe we call Thoreau and we say that these people are closer to the Earth .
The popular of the Ingenes are not feeling or not feeling .
There is no space for these things in the malarial paluor in the winchelids of the Tibet , but thank you for the time and the ran , they 've created a mystical inno-on the planet , but on a way of an intuition of the Earth can only live only because it 's ununlike the Earth can only live only because it 's unhappy .
What does it mean ?
It 's going to say that a girl of Ande who is growing up in the mountain is a spiriririd of Apu who 's going to be a very different human being a deeply different human being a deeply different relationship with the mountain that place in a mountain different ars of the Montana who grow up in the Montana who grow up to be screen .
which is the dimed of a spirit or a mineral cutting is irrelevant .
What 's interesting is the metaphor that defines the relationship between the individual and the natural world .
I grew up in the forests of the British Columbia credden that forests to be cutting .
So , this result me a different human being different from my friends Kwauters who believe that the forests are the Hukukuk and the band historical bhere , and the bhere 's historical , which live in the paradise of the world , spirites that they live in the Hamatsa .
If you start to look at that these cultures can create different reality , you can start understanding some of their own sensory sense . Let 's take this planning .
I 've taken this picture to open up in the nordocction .
Maybe some of you have heard of the ayahuash , the most powerful psychcoat .
What makes it fascinating the ayahuash is not the potential of the substance , but his elecaboration . It 's composition . It 's composition from two elements .
On one hand , this lian lian leghip of carboline , harmful and harmoline , harmolines , harmolines , harmolines , harmolines , harmful .
And I 'm going to take the only plants that altery a little bit of consciousness , but it 's measured with the leaves of a coffee of the coffee family , said Psychotridis said Psychotridis .
This plants contains powerful , tripptamine , very similar to serotonin , dimethyltryptamine-5 , methyltryly .
If you ever see Yanomami , you 're going to see the Yanomami , they 're contained with a different species of species , he 's contakeen in a ptamine .
Tiring that pounds on the nose is a little bit like to be disappeared by a carric of the byeyes and land on a sea of electricity . [ Res] . Don 't believe a distorsion of reality .
I was often on my professor , Richard Evan Shultes , the man who got down the psychchical , with his discoveries of the fungi , with his discoveries of the fungi , in the 1930s in Mexico .
I think my argue , you can 't classify these trippamines as hallucinated . Because if you 're not standing of being hallucinated .
It 's possible to be able to be the horally only if they 're assumptions with other chemicals that denize the MAO .
Now , the beautiful carboline : Youth carboline that are in this lian lian ist of MAO , the same kind of necessary to potential the tripal . The question is the spontaneous question : in a flour . The question is now of 80,000 species of plants , how do these popular , how do these popular , they make a biootic version that is supply unlike this , creating biochemical version of the subtthe subtparts ?
We use the great eupherous eupherror , which can reveal it 's unfruit .
But if we ask the Indians , they 'll tell us , " The plants are talking about . "
What does it mean ?
This tribes , the Cofan , has 17 variety of ayahuasks , which are not in the forest , and that our eyes would be in the forest in the species .
If you ask them as they stand their tassonomes , they 'll say , " I thought I was going to understand it , " I was not all ? " I said , " No . "
The solution is : You take the 17 variety of a moon and each one will be in a different doterm .
With this is not in Harvard , but it 's much more interesting than content the starts .
Now , [ applaushing ] the problem is that even the people of them are in the popular people are in the paintings are in the painting of our real world , and it 's going to move beyourself in the world , and it 's pass .
In fact , the 20th century , in 300 years , it 's not going to be remember the guerre or of the technologic innovations , but rather as the one was where we stopped and actively accepted , or accepted by passively or accepted the destruction of the planet .
All cultures through the centuries have been involved in a dance for new possibility of life .
And the problem is not the technology .
The Indians Sioux , they don 't have stopped to be Sioux when they put it in the arc and they 're in as well as they have no stopped to be American , when they put up and hot .
It 's not the change or the technology that threatening the integrity of the etnosphere . It 's the power .
The last flight flight .
And if you give a look at the world , you know that these are not destinated cultures that these are not destinated cular .
They 're living creatures and dynamic of the identifying identify identify of the adaptation of their adaptation .
I know , it 's deal with the pathries in the Penan echcheap --
a people who have a Sarawasian nor , in the Sarawasian , a popular that has lived in the forest to a generation ago , and now reduced to the servitus and the prostitution of the river , where you can see the river , where you can see the river , it 's a fighter , where the ethic river the horidist , where the navails of the ethumbs , where you 're giving the honte ,
With the forest sticky stimimmits with the forest .
Or , in the case of Yanomami , are the disease that I 've got to the discovery .
If we move on on the mountains of Tibet , where I 'm doing a lot of research , you see the hard hard hard to see the political domination .
As you know the genocide , the physical extinction of a popular , is universal level , but the ethnocide , the destruction of life , not only is convicted , but it 's not only convicted , but advertising in certain environments , because it makes part of the developing of the development .
And you can 't understand the Tibet until you 're part of the Tibet until it 's beginning .
I 've been on the 6,000 miles from Chengdu in China through the Western Tibet , in Lhasa with a young connection , but only came to Lhasa with a young connection , but only came to Lhasa , I realized what we feel about .
6,000 search and cooking .
1.2 million people killed by the military in Cultural Rvolution .
The dad of this guy , it was ascriticized at Panchen Lama .
which means that it has been killed in the temple of the Chinese invasion .
Her , it 's been fushing with Santity in Santity , in Nepal .
Her mother was imprigioned and his colpe was to be rich .
It 's been brought to the age of two years old , hidden under his wish because it wouldn 't have live without him .
The sister , which did the same , it was put in reducing .
A day he inavailed calculus , a coffigant fascination Mao and , for this transgression , was put it in the journey .
The Tibet of Tibet can be inoverwhelmed , but the spirit of the people is because of the tent .
At the fin , it all reduces a choice .
Do we want to live in the world world world of the monothoonia or do we want to academics of diversity ?
The great anthropologists Margaret Mead , before he died that his largest fear was that , in our way to this lower view of the world , not only we 'll see the whole range of human imagination reduced to a limited mode of thinking , but one day , we 're going to see from a sleep to a sleeping mode from a sleep .
And it 's umillion people remember our species is about 600,000 years .
The Neolitic Rivolution , which has gives us agriculture , which has been given us to fight the cult of the seed of the seed shaman with the prosa of of the clines , and we talk about 10,000 years ago .
The modern world industrialized has been 300 years .
The sharp story , I don 't suggests that we have the answers to all the challenge that we 're going to have to do in the millennia to come .
When you get these myriades of the world is asked what it means to be humans , they rescue with 10,000 different voices .
And it 's in these answers that we all have the possibility of being what we are : a kind of conscious , which has to make all of the people and all of the gardens can fire . And there are great moments of optimism .
I 've taken this picture on the northern island of Baffin , when I went to the whales with Inuit , and this man , Olaya , and this man , Olayas , and this man , Olayas , he said , it 's a wonderful story of his grandfather .
The English government has not always been welsewhere with the Inuit and in the 1950s to stabilire our own premimiracy , we put them in colon-up .
The grandfather of this man refutting to go .
The family , I 'm teming it for his life , I took him all of the attitude .
You have to know that Inuit doesn 't temon the cold , they exploit .
The packs in the stream were made of fishes in the pain .
The grandfather of this man did not intimight or from the library , or from the library .
It 's sgattaitholded , it calculated the pinter pall and defecated in their hand . When I did it , they did it , the follow , it 's creating a mobile .
It 's spring on the points of this hone-sheet , and when it became solid , he killed a dog .
It 's a guns of the dog and created a brighter , with the cass , he made a sleep , and it 's disappeared on the block , and it 's disappeared on the block , and it 's disappeared on .
Do you want to talk about cavarself-indeed with nothing ? [ Resus , in different ways , [ Applausi is the symbol of the people in the world 's popular .
In the 191999 , the California , the Solden , the total control of a total area of the largest California and Texas monds together .
It 's their new patria . It 's called Nunut .
It 's a independent territory . They 're all the resources of minerarian .
One splendido example of how a natione-state can recognize with his people .
And , to finish , I think it 's rather obvious at least to who we have been in these remote places on the planet , realizing that they 're not remote at all .
For somebody is home .
They represent sexual of human imagination that rising at the douba of the time . And for all of these children , as the dreams , they become part of our children , they become part of the geography .
From , we know , National Geographic we convinced that politicians will never come to nothing .
We believe that the polemies --
[ Applausi is not persuasive , but we believe that stories can change the world , and maybe we 're the best institution to tell stories of the world . Each our site has 35 million visit visit .
156 countries transmit our television channel .
Our rivers are letters from millions of people .
Our work is traveling in the etnosphere to bring our audience in places of beautiful cultural , from which they 're going to go out with how they have seen and , it 's hopeful , they will be able to , and we have to find a time the central reveal in the diversity , and we have to find a life in the world , and we have to find a life in a pluralist and multicultural world in a pluralist and multicultural world in the world ,
where the wisdom of all the populations can contributing to our collective well-being .
Thank you .
I 'm going to talk about some things that I wrote in this book that I hope I 'll be called the other that I 'm going to try to figure out some connections , in case not notice .
I want to start with what I call the official dogma official dogma .
The official dogma of what ?
The official dogma of all the Western society , the western official dogma : " If we want to massive our citizens . "
The reason is , from one side , in fact that freedom is the same as a value , is useful , is a value , is a user , is a user , is essential for humans .
Or the other is that if we 're free , each one of us can act for just doing everything that massive to do everything that massive our well-being , without no one that we 're going to name .
The way to massimilar freedom is massimilar to the choice .
The more choices people have , more libutterly , and more of the freedom , is their well-being .
This , I think , it 's so deeply radicated in society that nobody would dream to put it in doubt .
And it 's also deeply round in our lives .
I 'm going to show you some examples of what progress has made possible .
This is my supermarket . It 's not particularly big .
I lose a simple note on conditions .
In my supermarket , there are 175 conditions , without content the gin of the olive olive olive oil and 12 cococouthy , which you can buy for a number of condition , that nobody of the 175 proning to be your degree .
So , this is the supermarket .
Then you go to the electronic store to buy a stereo : casse , the CD lector , radio , piaright , the rate .
And in this single store of electronic store , there 's a big number of components .
We can do six million and a half of different combinations , using the components that there are only one store .
You have to admit that there is a lot of choice .
Other fields : the world of communications .
Once , when I was a child , you could get all the wish telephone services , at the breeding telephone .
It was going to go to the phone , you didn 't buy it .
A consequence of that , between the other , it was that the phone .
These times are gone .
Now we have a variety of telephones , especially between cell phones .
Here 's the cell phones of the future .
My favorite is that in the middle , MP3 , cuts of nose , and forced the butterly , and the butterly .
If you don 't have yet seen it in the store under the house store , you 're well certain you 're going to be .
And what happens to the end is that people are in the stopping , and it 's the answer ? The answer is " No . "
It 's not possible to buy a cell phones that don 't make too much .
So , in other things of life that are much more important than aquers , you know , the same thing is explosion .
Assistence : The health care : no more in the United States that you go from the doctor and the doctor you need to do .
Instead , you go to the doctor , and the doctor says , " OK , we could do . In the fact , " By , " has these benefits and these risks . What do you want to do ? "
You say , " Dotic , what should I do ? "
And the doctor says , " A has these benefits and these sets , and B has these benefits and these well-risks . "
" What do you want to do ? "
And you 're rebats : " Dotic if she was me , what would you do ? "
And the doctor : " But I 'm not . "
The result of the word " malutomy of maluth , " expression that makes it look like a beautiful thing .
But it 's not that one of the weight and responsibility of taking decisions from someone knows something , which is the doctor , which is the doctor , to someone else knows , and it 's not about -- and so in the ideal condition to make the patient .
There 's a huge marketing of products , drug direct people like me and you , that if you think about it 's not a sense , because we can 't buy them .
But if we can 't buy them , because you have the public ?
The answer is that they want to be in the morning , we call the doctor to ask them to change the rich .
Something that we have to be as our identity is a question of choice , as you see in this wish . " We don 't want to force children . We don 't want to force children to the right moment . " We don 't want to force the right moment . " We don 't want to invent .
And we can reinvent how many times us .
That means that every morning , at the risk , you have to decide that kind of person wants to be .
I 've been to the family and marriage , a time the common perspective , unhappy , it was that you were married the most soon as possible , and it was that you know , and it was starts to be the most on possible .
The only real choice was with who , not when you know , and it 's not what do after .
Over the day , it 's really to play .
I teach students , and I do their own 20 percent of the work than a time .
And it 's not because they are unless , because they 're less diligent .
but why are I impensive , I mean , I mean , " Would I have to be there ? "
" Do I have to be marrirightly later ? "
They 're interrupon the retrogatives .
And they try to answer these questions , even if this implacy not to be able to do this , and not getting a beautiful vote to my examples .
And they really have to do it . They 're important questions .
Now , the work : we 're lucky , like Carl soon , because technology allows us to work every minute , every day , from every corner on the planet , except that from the Hotel Randolph .
In the parenth , there 's a angle , and I 'm not going to tell anyone , where the WiFi works .
I don 't tell you , because I want to use it .
What does this mean , this incredible freedom of choice that we have to work ? It 's that we have to decide , continuously , if we have to work or not .
We can go to see our son playing hot , with the cell phone , the Blackberry in the other , and the news , and the notion , and the notion , and the news , typically , on the gink .
And even if they are all spent , every minute that we see our child supply , we 're also asking the partners , we 're also asking this called ? "
" Do I have to answer this email ? I have to get this letter ? "
And even when the answer is " no , " all this makes the experience of your son , very different child than what would be in other conditions .
So , from any of the look at things , and great , materials and great materials and styles of life , life is a question of choices .
Once the world was this : Ovreal , there were some possibility , but it was a question of choice .
The world of today looks like this : The dilemma is , " Is it positive , or negative ? "
The answer is Surches .
The positive latest lats , we know all , so I 'm going to talk about the negative ones .
This is a choice compories of people .
The first , paradoxally , is that produced paralysally , is that produced paraling .
With many many options between which choose , becomes very hard to do it .
I give you an example : a study on the plan of voluntedly recently .
A connects of my colleague has had access to the data of Vankle pushing society , with about a million deployers in 2,000 different companies .
What she found is that for every 10 solutions that are actually actually actually in the most , the percentage of two percent .
With 50 source , there 's 10 percent in less than adhhold adesions than when they are available . Why ?
Because with 50 sources between between which I choose , is maledtly hard to decide , and the choice is sent to be sent .
And I asked tomorrow , and I wonder , tomorrow , and of course , and of course , I 'm not going to be .
You know , it doesn 't only mean that these work from the old work from the people will be food for dogs because they don 't have enough money , it 's so hostical that lose is so hostical that lose is so hostical source that they lose the birth of work .
They 're not participating , they 're losing until five thousand dollars a year from work , which is really well disposed to be .
So , the paralisis is a consequence of having too much choices .
And I think that makes the world like this .
" And finally , for the ethernity : ketchup , senape or maion ? "
You would like to take the right decision , if it 's for the ethernity , right ?
You don 't want to choose the wrong wrong , and you know , the wrong condition .
So this is the first effect . The second is that even if we can avoid paraling the paralysis and do a choice , we 're less soddisfaced by the result of how we 're going to be with less options between how we 're chosen .
And that 's about this for different reasons .
One of these is that with many conditions between which I choose , if you buy one and it 's not so easy to imagine that you could do a different choice that you could do a different choice that would be better . And what happens is that the alternative of the choice , and the reflflflying the choice , and the repeeer the soddisfer , and the repeeer the soddisfation ,
even when it was a good decision .
The more choices there are , more is really easy to dislit than any detail that is insoddisfacing .
Also , there 's what economists call expensive .
Dan Gilbert has been very well stamattine as the value that we 're depending on things to things that we 're confronted .
Of the rest , when there are many options , it 's easy to represent the features of alternative arms and be less soddisrupt of the option that you have been choice .
Here 's an example . I 've been schools with all of the ones that are not New York .
But that 's what you would probably think of .
There 's this couple to Hamptons .
A place of lussian .
Spiddaydaightendd . It 's all about them .
Not nothing . But what he thinks is , " Well , the day-up , it 's Agotten . "
" All my neighbors in Manhattan . "
" I could talk about it right home . "
And it 's going to spend two weeks I see that it 's losing -- every day -- the possibility of parking where it wants .
The expensive opportunity decrease the ddisfair for what we have , even when the choice is a cell .
And the most of the options that we have to think , the more the actractive characteristic .
Here 's another example .
This is a lot of things like this .
It 's about the living moment , and maybe live slowly .
But the most important point is that you 're going to be able to do other .
The things that we don 't choose to be so much attractive that can make less attractive what we do .
Third point : spiral growing of expectations .
I tried it on my skin buying a new jeans .
I 'm almost always jeans .
Once jeans were just just like , buy them and bestight them and they were besty , and they were undyed , and they were a lot of times , they started to go well .
So , I went to buy a couple of the time when the old people had gone , and said , " I need a couple of jeans , this is my cutting . "
The committed commodity said , " Loowned , and fit ? "
Do you want to do with the cerniquer or with the bottons ? "
" Looking , you know , " Looking ? "
" Sotto them or cool ? Bla bla bla bla -- " Continured to elentained .
I was sbalord , and after a little bit , I could say , " I want the guy that was the only guy , " I want the guy to be , so for a time , I tried to all the jeans , and then I was out of the store , I 'm going to have a better jeans .
It was the massive . With all that I had the best .
But I felt worse .
Why ? I wrote a whole book for the way to understand it .
The reason I was worse is that with all that choice of my expectations were very high , jeans had to be perfect .
I had expectations . I didn 't expect to do anything exceptional , when it was there , but when it saw 100 different , steps , like a must be perfect .
What I had buy was good , but not perfect .
After I had paragoned that I was trying to do with what I was trying to do in confronted to the expectations .
The added options in life of people don 't do that expectations that these have respect to be respected with options .
And this is going to be less satisfaction , even when the result result .
None in the world of marketing if it realized .
Because if they knew it , you wouldn 't know what I 'm talking about .
The truth looks more like this .
" You know , it was better when it was worse . " The reason it was better when it was worse is that when it was worse was still possible to meet of surprised .
Over the world , in which we live -- the world , the citizen expectancy , the most performance we can hope is that things are at the altitude of the expectations .
You never have surprised pleasure because your expectations , my expectations , I 'm ingantic .
The secret of happiness -- what you 're here -- is , " Baxis expectations . " Yes , you want . "
I mean , little biographic moment -- which is really married and my wife is really really amazing .
I couldn 't do it better , I didn 't have to be able .
But it 's not always a bad thing .
And finally , a consequence of buy a couple of jeans when there is only that kind of jeans is that when you 're not satisssatic , and ask you , " Why ? "
" Who responsible ? " , the answer is clear .
The world is responsible . What could I do ?
When there are hundreds of kinds of jeans , and buy a unsatisfacent , and ask you who are responsible , is the question , is the clear , is the question of you .
You could do better .
With hundreds of of variety , there are not uncomfortable for the insuccess .
So when people take decisions , even if the result is the result is the satic , they feel like , and they 're going to give it .
In the last years , the depression is exploded in the industrialized world .
I think that a meaningful factor -- not the only one , but important -- of this honate depression is that people have a delude experience because the standard are too high .
And when they have to explain this situation that they think that the colpe is they think they 're .
So the final result is that we 're better , obviously , but we feel worse .
Let me remember you .
This is the official dogma , what we all take for good and it 's completely fell . It 's not true .
There 's no doubt that a little bit of choice is better than having it , but it 's not really about it . But it 's not a little bit of a little bit .
There 's a critical value , I don 't know what it is .
But I 'm sure we 've been enough to a piece of a piece where the choices make our life .
Now , from the political point of view -- I 've almost finished -- from the political point of view , the nockle is the following .
What it allows this to the industrial society is the wealth of the material .
There are many places in the world , and you know , you know , where the problem is not that they have been too much choice .
The problem is they have too bad .
So the factory I 'm talking about is a mal-being extruly exclusive of modern , rich society .
And what it does to be and climbing is this : Steve Levitt has to tell you about how much those expensive and the argue discover ways of these expensive ,
I mean , these choices , complicated complicated , and available , is not that they 're just unuseful .
They 're concerned with the geries .
They do it stand worse .
If a little bit of what our society in our society allows , and it 's been reversed in those where people are too few possibility , it would not only be their life to improve but our .
This is what economists call a pareth improve improve .
A redistribution of the income redistribution is all of the poor -- because of this choice in excess that we 're going to .
To finish : " You can be all of the way you want . "
You , people of culture , you think , " What is it crets that fish ? "
" It 's obvious that you can 't make anything in a glass . "
" A castrategist , a limited view of the world -- "
and I 've been interpret this so , at the beginning .
But then , I think , I 've realized that that the fish knows the long way .
Because the reality of the facts is that if you 're missing the bottom , so that " everything is possible . " You get the paralisent .
If you break the cut down in a way that all of diminughter .
You can get the paralist , and you reducing the well-being .
They all need a sphere .
This is almost certainly too closely , maybe even for the fish , and certainly for us .
But the above of some symbolic symbolic sphere is a recipe for infeless and , for the ruin .
Thank you very much .
