I 've showed these slides to demonstrate that the glacial calottical calculations , which for almost three million years had the size of the 48 continental .
But this underwater undervalue the gravity of the problem because it doesn 't show the spessor of the ice .
The arctic glacial calculation is , in a sense , the pite heart of the global climate system .
It 's expanded by extreme and extreme .
The next slide will be a quick carrelated to the last 25 years .
The glaces are made in red .
As you see , you expand until the blue wall .
That 's the ice in the winter , which is ritized extreme .
You can see that the cosidges , of five years or more , is like blood , which is like blood , which is like blood , which is like blood , which is like blood , which is like blood , which is like blood , which is like blood , which is like blood , which is like blood , which is like blood , which is like blood
In 25 years , it 's past that , so
This is a problem because the restation is interacted the ice ice of the ground , where there are huge amount of carbon where there are huge carbon that , you have a lot of carbon dig .
I 'm going to go to the totality of the inatmospherical restation , that amount of of global warming could doubled , super---re-re-re-down .
In some of the lags in Alaska , it 's already rebolling out of the water .
The professor Katey Walter of the University of Alaska was a team in a team of a team in a team of a lapon last last last last last last invers .
Video : Wow ! Al Gore : I 'm good . I think if we 're also going to be .
That 's why this termiculal surroundaries from the North .
This is a hyme to the glacial records .
The lasted had never reached to the similar .
This is the Kangerlussuaq , in the west of Groenland .
If you want to know how to be the sea level for the sea of the ice of the ice of the ice of the sea .
These are running out of them .
Another part of the planet : Antartide , the bigger block of the planet .
The month was last month scientists have dichieve that the bilaneous billates that the arctment of the ice is in the negative , which pogers on some islands , is particularly rapid in the sun .
It 's six feet of the level of the sea level of the bottom , like Groenland .
Himalaya , the bigger block of ice , you see new lags , you see new lagey , which a few years ago , they were glaciers .
40 percent of the world population will revenue half of the potail of water .
Sulle Ande : this glacier is the source of water , a potable water of this city .
The luck is increased .
But when it 's going to deminds , the same happens to the potail .
In California , I mean , the nenow , the Sierra Nevada is diminuity of 40 percent .
The idrices are in the crime .
The predictions , as you have read , they 're good .
The growth in the world leads to a remarkable remarkable .
The environmental disasters are increasing a rim out of the normal and without previous .
Four times more numbers in the last 30 years , I previous 75 .
This is a wanddance of all insustainable .
If you look at the historical context if you can see the consequences .
In the last five years , we added 70 million tons of CO2 every 24 hours -- 25 million tons in the ocean every day .
Look at the East Pacific area , from the Americans , to the west , to the west , and on both of the Indian , where there 's a radical radical radical .
The major cause of global warming , together , and the deforestation , which is the use of fossil fuel .
Or is a problem , and the carbon is even worst .
The United States is one of two countries with the most emissions , together to China .
And he was a lot of other carbon carbon .
But we 're seeing a direction .
These are the anullated in the last few years and some green propoins of green .
Every way , there 's a political lobe in our country .
The carbon industry and oil have spent 250 million dollars in the last year for promoting carbon , which is a bsite , which is a oxymologist .
That image I remember something --
Natal , in the Tennessee , where I live , there was a 3.8 billion powers of carbon .
Maybe you saw the news .
This is the second bigger flusc flussies in America .
It 's happened around Natal .
The nalization of one of the carbon industry was this .
Video : It 's going to be a very high---a-like , I 'm going to be a happy and happy .
It 's abundant here in America , and it 's going to grow our economy .
Frostroy carbon is more and more and more cleaned .
It 's good price , adorable and the work , they 're going to be store .
Al Gore : It 's a lot of the West Virginia .
The bigger society mineral on the mountain is Massey Coal . This is his administrator .
Video : Don Blankenship : I 'm going to be clear -- Al Gore , Harry Reid -- they 're not going to know what they 're talking about .
Al Gore : So the Alleance for the Protexima has two campaign two campaign .
This is a part of them , a part .
Video : Acore : Acore COALery : ALery : We see the climate change as a sea a a seactor to our business .
So , our priority is investing a big amount of money in a bundancing to make public and confused the real real real .
It 's actually not sporite .
We think it 's cleaned -- it 's also a good profuel .
So , not preocups of climate change .
Let 's go to us .
Video : Acore : Carbone pullit -- you heard a lot of it .
So let 's take a lot of a structure at the danger for the pullit .
Straordinary ! The machines are a little rumorous , but this is the sound of carbon technology .
The fuel consumption is between the main core cause , but the remarkable technology , but the remarkable of fuel that you see all .
You have a look at this : this is the pullit technology .
Al Gore : Infinally , the positive the positive to economic issue and the security of the national security .
Video : The economy , the economy , the economy , the economy , the climate crisis .
The river that connects to all , our dependence by fossil combustible combustible , as carbon fuel and oil .
Now , there 's a new , audace , is a new , audable ,
Repower , 100 percent of the energy , in 10 years .
A slose to reput America to work , and make it more surance , and help to stop the global warming .
Finally , a solution that bastes to solve our problems .
Repower . It 's more than that .
Al Gore : This is the last one .
Video : It 's about to regive energy to America .
One of the most fastest ways of to dependence by the combustible combustible that killing our planet .
Comparsa : The future is here . I 'm going to , a new network .
Comparsa two : Neggs for a ben , for a ben retribes .
Not a cost of the reports . It 's time to be realists .
Al Gore : A old proverbio African , says , " If you want to go fast , you go to fast .
If you want to go away away , you go together . "
We have to go away away , quickly .
Thank you very much .
Last year at TED , I 've got a introduction on the LHC .
And I promise to travel to travel you about how the machine works .
So , I 'm going to do that . And for those that the other time , there were the biggest scientific experiment -- ever tented -- 27 kilometers of circumstoms .
His complished is to rerestriate the conditions that were at less than a billion second from the beginning of the universe -- until 600 million times a second .
All that 's just ambiitious .
This is the machine under Ginevra .
We have a bunch these min-Big Bang in the reflikers .
This is what I work . It 's called ATLAS -- is 44 feet and he has a diameter to 22 meters .
This is a spectacular picture of ATLAS in building , so you can see the proportions .
TTT-wettember last year , we have acceso the car for the first time .
And this picture was taken by ATLAS .
It was because of immense festeggments in the room of control .
It 's a picture of the first fashion that had done all the LHC , entering in collision , in collision , with a part of the HC , and spread particles inside the reflights .
In other words , when we see that image 10 settember , we realized that the machine worked , which is a great wictory .
I don 't know if it was this to exultate of the more or this , when somebody went on on on Google and saw the pages that the page was this .
That means we had a cultural impact beyond beyond to the scientific impact .
About a week after , there was a problem with the car , to have to these files here -- these brought .
These are files 13,000 amps when the machine works at the massive of the potence of the potence .
Now , the technique between you will look at the river and say , " It 's not true . I 'm smoved too . "
And they can do it because when I 'm very cosiddicks .
So , at least 271 degrees , in a temperature in the space between stars , these can bring that running that running that running .
In one of the giuntures of the most novehicle magneti in the LHC , there was a defect of fabication .
So the files are going to be a slightly , and the 13,000 herself , and they had a electricity .
This was the result .
Now , this is more impressive if you think about that these magneti fish that these weight more than 20 tons , and that 's been moved about 30 centimeters .
It 's been like about 50 magnetes .
We had to take them , what we did .
We 've rested and traveled .
They are now now coming back to their underground .
I 'm going to be a new integral LHC is is going to be new integral .
We 'll access it , and we expect to get the data or the right data , and we continue to be so much the morning , and we 're going to find out what 's the morons that are the morons that are the morons that are constitude that 's the morning ,
Now , of course , in a certain way , these accidents return the debate of science and engineering in front of science and engineering in front . It 's easy to confuture .
I think the fact that it 's so hard , the fact of the limitations , I think it 's the value of things like LHC .
I want to conclude with the words of a English scientist , Humphrey Davy , which , I think , in difetime , in difenjoy , his pupille was Michael Faraday , his pupille was Michael Faraday , and that 's not a lot of the ideas of science as the idea of the human mind that the idea of science is the definitely , which we don 't have new worlds of our tribes .
Thank you .
I want to start to ask you to rethink about when , kids , you play cooowns .
And as you can reach them , and they 're going to take them and move them , and you know , you know , actually , you know , actually , you know , and we 're going to be able to think and solve .
The space is deeply connected to the way we understand a lot of the world around us .
So , from the inspired use of our interaction with physical objects , together to my physical consulent , and my collaborator , and my collaborator . I started to ask me , " And if I use a computer , I started to ask ask ask him , " And if we use a computer , you have only only only a computer , you know , we could trust a bunch of willlllat the wand-and-wider , we could truly an information with your hands , with your hands ,
and sistage it to our please ?
The question was so interesting that we decided to explore the answer , we built the Siftable .
In a few words , a Siftable is a great interactive computer as a biscope .
In a few words , a Siftable is a great interactive computer as a biscope .
You can move to the hand , they can , " you see " between them , " and they have a screen and a radio wireless .
But I 'm basically , physicians , are physicians , like the mors , you can move it simply ,
The Siftable is the example of a new ecosystem to manipulate information .
And as they get more physicians , consciousness of the way , of the other , and as they become more physicians , consciously , of how we move them , we can explore explore and different kinds of interaction .
I 'm going to start with some simple example .
This Siftable is configured to show the video : if you 're inclin in a direction , the video , the video ran , the video ran back .
These retreat is active .
If you take them , they 're interested what 's around .
If they 're circumstances , and they can act a little bit .
If they 're circumstances , and they can act a little bit .
They also have their clination and inlination .
We then realized that one of the most implications of the interaction was to be able to use management , to " a color like a liquid .
In this case , we have three Siftable of configurate as a green bone and I can use them to the color , where they mix .
and I can use them to the color in the central color , where they 're missing .
If we 're too much , we can put a little place .
I 'm also good possibilities of appreciation , like language , the mathematics and games where people can try to get things very quickly , and you see the results of the immediately .
Now , I 'm --
This is a Fibonaccomplished that I do with a equations .
Here we have a game of words that 's in half in the Scarabeo and Boboble .
Pratically , at every single re-re-re-put letter letter in every Siftable , Pratically , at every Siftable , and when you 're trying to get a letter in the Siftable .
And then , after about 30 seconds they have a new leck set , and you have a new leck and new possibility to try .
Thank you .
Here 's the kids come to the Media Lab , I did so that I tried to be , and I did a video .
They have a very liked .
And one of the things that kind of application is that we don 't have to give people a lot of education .
You have to just say , " Compones of words , and they know exactly what to do .
Here 's what 's what they 're trying to do .
This is our behind tester , there 's the world .
It was actually wanted to just impilling them .
They 're only morning , for him .
Now , this is a appliation of a interactive chartone .
We wanted to build a tool for the apprentice of the Lui Lui is Felix .
It can insert new characters in the scene , by the Siftable their own .
It can insert new characters in the scene , by the Siftable their own .
So , it 's doing the sun .
Video : The sun is smile .
David Merrivers : Now , she took a hern in the scene .
Video : The treat treat .
Bel work !
So , you know , the Siftable and put closer can make the characters --
Video : Bau !
-- by inventing your story .
Video : Hey !
DM : It 's a very open story , and it can decide him how you sleep .
DM : It 's a very open story , and it can decide him how you sleep .
Video : Very , just cat .
DM : The last example I have time to show you is a tool , I have a tool , to championing and exececectual music .
It 's a tool , I 've been recently , to chamamamples and execececectual music .
The Siftable here , based on the bottom , based and the battery .
Each of these has four different variations , and you can choose to be using .
You can also put these sound in a sequence of compories to your pleasure .
And I 'll just show you a sound of sound and a sequence .
These are actually going to control from the vial , like the riverbero and the filter .
It 's a particular sound and then inclens for them .
And then there are the general effects like time and fly , which is applied to the internal sequence .
Let 's look at how it works .
Video : We 're going to start putting a base in two Siftable sequence , we 're going to put a series , we add , we add .
Now I put a bottom line .
Video : Now , I add to percussions --
Video : And I 'm going to put the bacteria , so I can control the effect from the vial goal .
Video : I can faster the internal sequence of the internal sequence time by one , or another .
Video : I 'm going to add the bottom m m to give more expression .
Video : I can recombine the sequence of the flight .
So I don 't have to plate it before , but I can suddenly suddenly , rererereach it the longer or cord .
And now , I can spend the whole sequence of the inclining of the BBrits . "
Thank you .
So , you can see , my passion is to build new interfaces more and more somiles like our brain and body .
And I 've had time to show you one of the result of this percourse , and also some possibility that we try to bring out of the lab .
The concept I want to transmit is that 's coming out of this new generation of objects to interact with digital media , which will bring information in our world .
Thank you very much .
I don 't see the time to talk to all of you .
I 'm a writing .
I 'm going to wish books is the profession , but it 's more than this , of course .
It 's also love and the fashion and my own life .
And I don 't expect to change .
But , I said , something particular happened in my life and in my career , which has brought me to restalibrate the whole thing with this work .
The particular thing is I 've been written this book , this biography called " Mangia , Prega , " which , I think , diversof my previous books , for some reason used in the world and became a great feelational , bestyle , and I 'm going to be a great feeling , bestylious , bestyle .
And the result is that everywhere to go now , people treat me as if I was conconstructed .
It 's true -- you know , you 're constructed .
They 're all going to me to all worried and they say , " You don 't have fear to do better ?
You don 't have fear to keep writing for all life without being able to create a book that can be able to create a book that can be somebody ? "
which can be important to someone ? "
It 's unsured , you know .
But it might go worst , I remember that I remember that more than 20 years ago , when I started saying to say , I was an adolescent -- I wanted to be a wrote .
I was going to inward the same reaction .
And people said , " I don 't have to be successed ?
Do you have no fear that the refit killed you ?
You have no fear to do this mestize for all of life without anything about it out and death on a cure of dreams with a bunch of dreams with the mouth of friend .
So , you know .
The answer -- the short answer to all these questions is , " Yes . "
I 'm fear of all those things .
I 've always had fear .
And I also have a lot of other things that people can 't income to .
As the algae and other things .
But , for the way I writing what I thought and I was very last is why ?
Is it rational ?
It 's logical that anyone has to wait to be spent by a work that 's been boring for a job .
But what 's about that particular in the impression , creative , and it 's about the mental health care of the other other people in a way that other carriers don 't do ?
How my father , for example , he was a chemical engineer and I don 't remember one time in his 40 years of activity that he asked if he was a little bit of a capable engineer ?
There was never -- that was -- that blogging John , as it 's a ?
It wasn 't that , so you know ?
Onestly , chemicals like a group have not certainly , in the chemicals , they drive the reputation of being alcolized , to be alcocolized .
We writers , we have enough to have this reputation , and not just writers , but you have this reputation of being huge instable .
And it 's not to another one of the triad of the magnifetime of the magnifments that , only in the 20th century , they die young people and often die .
And also the ones that you don 't have any sounds like to be really disfaced by their dones .
Norman Mailer , before I die , in the last interview said , " My book , he killed me a little more more " an extraordinary affermonstration about work .
But we don 't have a little bit of the way , because we heard these things so long that we 've been completely interiorized and accepted the notion that creativity and suffering is in some ways and that the art , at the end , it will always take a few ways and that art , at the end .
And the question I want to take all of the question is , you know with this idea ?
It 's good this thing -- because it 's looking at this thing -- because it 's a hundred distance to me not good for nothing .
I think it 's odious .
And I think it 's dangerous and I don 't want to see the perpetuated in the next century .
I think it 's better encourage our big creative minds .
And I surely know that , in my case -- in my situation -- it would be very dangerous to start fuse that I 'm not going to start to be able to start to be able to start to be in my career .
Of course -- I 'm just looking at , I 'm quite a young , I have about 40 years .
I have still about four decades of work in me .
And it 's very likely that anything I 'm going to be right now going to be jumped by the world as the work that was going out after my last book .
I 'm going to be slavery , because we 're all more or less friends here -- it 's likely to my own .
Oh , Gesus , who thought !
You know this is the kind of thought that leads a person to start to bing the nine of the nine of the morning and I don 't want to do it .
I would take to keep doing this work that I work .
So , the question is it , like ?
And so I think , after a lot of reflection , which the way to work to continue to write is to create a psychologic costage , OK ?
I have to find a lot of security in my own , I 'm writing , and my natural anxial anxiety of which reaction that he wrote that I was going to get the time , trying to get the last year models that we start looking through the time , trying to find other society to see if they could have the best ideas and more healthy and more healthy healthy to see if they could have have ideas and more sane .
How to help people believe that the inerent people creative emotional inerent emotional ,
And that research has led me to the Greek and ancient Rome .
I think I 'm going to go to me because I 'm going to go back .
In the ancient Greek and ancient Rome -- people don 't seem to believe that creativity was indeed by men , OK ?
It was thought that creativity was this spirit , and they come from men from men from a few distant sorts of people , and unknown , for distant reasons and unknown , for distant reasons .
The greatens were called these spirites of creativity , " demons of creativity .
You look at , wonderful , wonderful , he believed to have a demon that elareas from away away .
The Roomes were the same idea , but they called the the kind of spirit without a genius .
That 's great , because Roands didn 't think that a genius was somebody particularly smart .
They think that a genius was this kind of devine , which was literally in the muri of an artist , a little like the elphotos of an artist , a little like the elphotos the work of the artist work of the work of the artist work of the work of the artist work and modeling the result of that work .
Here 's the same -- that 's the distance of which I 'm talking about -- that 's the distance of the psycholic coxicological constructs of your work .
And everyone knew that it was so that it worked , right ?
So the antiks were protected by certain things , like , for example , the too much of the wild , no ?
If your work was exceptional , you could not take all the deserve , all of you know that the wincorporate .
If your work failed , it wasn 't your work , right ?
Everybody knew that it was your genius to be a inable .
And so people han conceived the creativity in Occctually for a long time .
And then the Rinches came and all changed this big idea ; we put this great idea ; we put the human human to the center of the universe and the mysteries and without smothered space .
This was the principle of humanity and the people started thinking that creativity was completely from the ililikely .
And for the first time in the history , you start to referred to this or artist , like a rather than a genius .
And I have to tell you , I think that was a big mistakes .
I think I allow somebody , a simple person to believe that it 's like a recil as a recipient recil , and the source of all the mysteries , creativity , and you know , unknowable and ethist is a big by-human dancing .
It 's like to ask someone to ingoiate the sun .
It 's going to be histories and creates all these inexist , and they 're expectations on performance .
And I think it 's been this pressure to have been destroyed in 500 years .
And if this is true , and I think that 's , the question becomes , and now ?
Can we can do it .
Maybe I can go back to a more ancient comprement of human relationship between humans and mystery creative .
Or maybe not .
Maybe we can 't cell 500 years of thinking in a 18 minutes .
And there 's probably people in the audience that sollevers would be reading , I think , you know , they 're going to be able to be brought , they do that they follow the people in the next to their projects .
It 's probably not convince you all about this thing .
But the question I 'd like to take is -- why no ?
Why don 't I think that way ?
Because it 's more sense of anything else that ever heard to explain the exashist imprevebility of the creative process .
A process that , as anyone who has been trying to do something -- so , basically , all here -- you know , you don 't have rationally .
And , in fact , it can sometimes seem completely paranormal .
I did this inagainst recently with the extraordinary poetry Ruth Stone , who has now 90 years , but that 's been a poeter for all life and said that during his childhood in the rural Virginia , and he felt , inside the camps , and he felt , inside of the landscreens .
He said that it was like a frageous trackle .
And that was rotolating to her from the landscape .
He felt it , because he had to be tremendous to be able to be able to be able .
He knew he had one thing to do at that point and was of , and he was , " to take like a main . "
And he goes to the house and was sitting in the back , and he wouldn 't have to have to take a piece of paper and a matter of enough and a match enough enough , and it would reach the page .
Sometimes I couldn 't be fast enough , so he 's going to be fast and correcrecreceived without getting home and the poetry rotten through and she had the rotten and she had been reached and he would continue to round the landscape , trying to reen through the landscape , trying to be a very fast .
And then there were those times -- this piece is not dementioned , I 'm going to never -- there were the moments where the was almost losing , OK ?
So , he was running home and he was trying to take a little bit and the poetry was going through , and then he was a mitry in the while he was passing , and then he said , which was like if you go to the other hand and he was reaching .
It was a poetry from the coda and remajor was going to put it on the page .
And in these cases , the poetime would be presented on the perfect page and intact but the last word to the first word at the first .
So when I felt that I was leck , it 's exactly the same same .
I don 't have all my creative process -- I 'm not a construct !
I 'm a mulo , and my way to work is ; I think about it , I 'm going to get up and work and I 'm going to work and pass and I 'm going to go on on the horary .
But even I have a stick in my headquarters , I 've striped against that thing , sometimes .
And I think that even a lot of you have the han .
You know , even though the work and ideas came to me from a source , I can 't know , I could not honestly saperformance .
And what is this thing ?
And how can we relate it in a way that we don 't have to lose the head , but rather , rather , which is a remain of people ?
And as I mean , the best example , I have the best example I have is the musician Tom Waits , which I 've interviewed different years ago for a newspaper .
We were talking about this , and you know , Tom , for the majority of life has been the incarnation of the artist tomented by contemporary , trying to control , to prove , to deal , to prove these species of creativity .
But then I 'm going to cut , I 'm going to cut up , and one day , he was driving on a higher in Los Angeles , he changed all for him .
He was going to be fast and all of a check of this little fragment of melodia , which comes in in his head as inspiration , and it takes , and you know , it 's wonderful , and you know , it 's wonderful , and it doesn 't know how to take it .
It 's not a piece of paper , it doesn 't have a mitness , it doesn 't have a math register .
So I started to hear this kind of old old old , " I 'm going to lose , and I 'm going to lose , and I 'm going to lose , and I 'm going to sessionate by this song , and I 'm going to lose it .
I 'm not good enough and I can 't do it . "
And instead of going to go to the panic , I 'm going to stop .
I 'm going to go to the whole mental process and he did something completely new .
I just just look at the sky and said , " I 'm not going to see that I 'm driving ? "
" Do you think that you can write a song .
If you really want to exist , you 're going to get me to a little bit of a time when I can take me for you .
Other , you go to importunch qualcement .
You know , I 'm going to disturbing Leonard Cohen . "
And his process changed after this .
Not the work , I 'm not going to work , they still know .
But the process , and the anxiety that was require was require when the genius , the genius that he had been remajor , the genius that was going to go back from where , realized that he didn 't have to be a whole thing .
but you know this peculiar , wonderful bizarre in collaboration between Tom and this strange and the outside that was not Tom .
So , how that story that story started to change a little bit even the way I was working and I had a time .
This idea , I 'm saved when I was writing " Mangia , Prega , and I did , and I add in one of those cave of the disperation that we take when we 're working on something and we 're not going to be a disaster , which is going to be the worst book write .
Not just bad , right the worst book written .
And I started thinking about giving this project .
But then I remember Tom I talked about Tom that I talked to the air and I tried to .
So I raised my face on the sites and I reached my common to a vacuum of the room .
And I said to get up , " Sologists , what we 're going to be brilliant , not going to be brilliant , not going to be brilliant , no ?
Because I 'm putting all of me , I 'm putting all I have , I don 't have more than this .
So if you want to be better , you have to presenting and do your part .
OK . But if you don 't do it , I don 't do it .
I 'm going to write to write the same because it 's my work .
And I 'd like to please that it was registered that I 'm presented to do my part of the North Africa , they 're so , OK -- I 'm going to -- I mean , OK -- they were just just a bunch of the pounds of the pounds of the bunch of the bunch of bulkness , and the music that was going on and hours to the alba .
And they were always magnify because the ballerins were professionals and they were fantastic .
But every lot , you know , something happened , and one of these artists had become actually transformer .
And I know what I know what I know you 're all seen , because I know that you all seen , a performance so .
It was like if the time , and the ballernal stopped through a kind of labor and he was not doing anything different from solved , and it was all all of them .
And at the suddenly , not the human .
But it 's going to come out of the divinity of the divinity of divinity .
And when this happened , when this was , the people knew what was , they called him .
They were going to start sleep , and they started to sleping , " Allah , Allah , God , " God , " God , "
That 's God , you know .
I mean , I was a historical note -- when the Morinvads the Spain , I was this abitude with them and the pronunced to the centuries of the Spain , " Ole , " which you can still hear in the corride or in the corride or in the flamh or in the flamek or in the flamp .
In Spain , when a artist did something impossible and magic , " Allah , I , I was , Allah , I was , I , I mean , I was , I mean , I was a last -- a last .
And it 's great because we need .
But , the problem comes the day after , for the ballerine , when you smoke and discovered that are 11 11 in Martedday and discovered that 's 11 in Martedday , and there 's no longer .
It 's just a mortal with grand bad , and maybe they can never get more to sell , and maybe they can never get more to sell to that altel .
And maybe nobody will you have the name of God still , and what does it have to do with the rest of his life ?
It 's hard .
This is one of the most paorous recognize to make in a creative life .
But maybe it doesn 't have to be so angoal if you can 't believe , and you can 't believe , and more extraordinary , which the most extraordinary aspects of your being from yourself .
But you might just have to prested by a fundamental inimaginable of this team of the team of your life that you have to go to someone else when you finished .
And , you know , if we think that it 's all changes .
And so I started thinking about , and it 's sure as I thought for different months in the work of the book that I 'm going to have been going to be on , the dangerous , attesissively , attesissively followed in my great succeeding .
And what I have to keep me when I feel eleventually , I feel fear to this is , not not fear .
Not just just to just your work .
You can put your side to presentate you for your part , any can be .
If your work is balling , you ball .
If the divine , I assurd you to take a few of wonderful , for a few kinds of wonderful , for a moment through the horses , then you know , " Ole ! "
Other , you do the same dance .
And " On you know , " at the same .
I think , and I think I have to teach it .
" On you know , " at the same , even for having had human love and testing tals that are tal tals to make you continue .
Thank you .
Thank you .
June Cohen : Ole !
As I 've been talking about some of these projects on the human genome , what can mean and the discoveries of genoes .
Now we 're starting a new performance . We started to digitalize the biology and now now we 're coming from that digital code , we 're going to go into a new fase of biology , and we 're going to go into a new biology , and we 're going to start to get out of the biology and now we 're going to start to digital
We always tried to ask a big questions .
What is the life ? " It 's something that many biologists have tried to understand vary vary vary .
We tried different approaches , reduced to the minimum .
We 're digitalizing by almost 20 years .
When we sequenced the human genome was to spend from the analome of the world of the digital world .
Now , we can regenerate life , or create new life , or to create new life from this digital universe ?
This is the map of a small organism , the Mycoplasma genitalium , which is the smaller from the smaller genome of the lab .
And we tried to reduce the genome of the genome to create one more little .
We 're able to eliminate a hundred genes of about 500 that are here .
But when we look at a look at his metabolic map , it 's relatively simple than our .
I think that 's simple .
But when we look at all the genes that we can take , one at the time , it 's very unlikely that this can bring to a living cells .
So we decided that the only way to progree was to synthize this chromosoma so that we can modify the components to bring some of these fundamental questions .
And so we started the adventure of " can we be able to synthize a chromosoma ? "
It can be able to produce these big molecules that we never have to create these big molecules that we never have to create before ?
And , in case , we can we make a chromosoma ?
A chemical chemical piece of inert material , inert of the chemical material .
The speed that we 're going to digitalize life is growing to the exponential .
Our skills to write the genetic code , instead of slowly , but it 's better .
And our most recent results the results of the exponential .
We started more than 15 years ago .
The process has been asked a lot of passages , starting with a biothetic revision before we started the first experiments .
But we found that synthesize DNA is very difficult .
There are thousands of machines in the world that produce small segments of DNA , the long age of 30 to 50 lectery and it 's a degenerative process : the longer process is longer , the ererror there are .
So we had to develop a new method to assemble these framments and correcrecreceive the mistakes .
And this was our first attempt , to partician , to partly digital information of the genome of the genome of the genome of the General genome ,
It 's a little virus that kills .
We designed the fragments , effectuated the correction of the mistakes and get a molecule of about 5,000 lecks .
The interesting part is when we took this chemical piece of inert material , and we 've insered it in bacteria , the bacteria have started reading this genetic code and properly , and we 've got it to be able to read viral code .
The viral particles have been require by cells , they 're back and they destroyed .
I 've been talking about recent in the oil industry , and they said that they have certainly compresress this model .
They have been more than you .
We think this is a situation where the software can really build the same hardware in a biological system .
But we wanted to do things in big .
We wanted to build the whole chromosoma .
I 'm over 580 miles of the genetic code .
So we thought of building it in the size of the virus , so that we can change the cassets to understand what the components of a living cells .
The design is crucial , and if we start with digital information in a computer , these must be very accurate .
When we sequenced this genome for the first time in 1995 , it was a mistakes for every 10 mile mile .
We discovered , it 's going to be 30 mistakes . If we had this original sequence never been able to be able to do it work .
One part of the process is designing over 50 lecks that are very long as 50 lecks that are 50 leck-units to build subunits smaller and build subunits smaller and work together .
We can proof the only one of the only one .
You probably have read that we 're going to be bed that we 're going to be a great deal .
So , think , we have a genetic code on four letters : A , C , G and T.
Three of those letters together , they codifeted about 20 friend , and there 's a specific order of letters for every friend .
So we can use the genetic code for write words , I think .
What we did at the beginning was autographed to do it .
Some have been delusers from the fact that it wasn 't poetry .
We designed these segments to just me to only me to only only only one with me .
There are me that they repect them and put them .
And we started assembling to assemble of parts , starting with segments , by five to seven miles , they can form segments of 24 miles , they 're only only only only to 72 mile them .
Every step , we 've produced these segments in abundance so that we 're trying to create a extremely robusto-- as you see in a minute .
We 're trying to automatize the process .
So , this seems to be the tabellone of the basket .
When we get to these very long , more than 100 mile , over 100 mile , they will not grow more directly in the Eccles .
It 's the limitations of the modern tools .
So we 've been considered other mechanisms .
We knew we had another mechanism called a recombination , which in biology , in biology , and in biology , and in biology to repair the segments .
Here 's a example .
This organism , called Deinococcus radiodurans , it can absors three million radioduring radiation .
You can see in the sound square like the chromosoft .
In 12 -- 24 hours , it 's riassembly like it was before .
They 're thousands of organisms that are able to do that .
These organisms can sit completely .
They can live under empty .
I 'm absolutely sure that life exist in space , and you know , saving places to find new riches of water .
ASA showed that this is .
This is a image of molecule that we built by using these processes , just using the lappropriate design of segments to insert .
The lights assemble .
This image is not been taken with a electronic microscope , but with a microscope .
It 's a molecule so big that we can see the with a lap microscope .
These are pictures that are cover a period of about six seconds .
This is the ads we 've done a little time ago .
I 'm over 580,000 letters of genetic code .
It 's the biggest molecule of a definite structure ever created from man .
It has a 300 million or 300 million .
If you stamp it with a caratter 10 without spaces , they would like 142 page for transcending this code .
Now , how do we work on ?
Of course , a virus is a game from kids .
It 's a little bit more complicated when they use bacteria .
It 's easier when it 's about eucariote as our : you can just be a nucleo and inserver one else , which is basically the process of clonation .
In the bacteria , the chromosoma is , but we recently demonstrated that we 're able to show that we 're able to make a complete trapipphibt of a chromosoma by one , and to activate it .
We can refed a chromosoma parting from a microbial species .
The two are different as men from the topes .
We added some gene more in a way that they can decide what to this chromosoma .
The then I 'm sitting with the labmes so to kill all the protein .
And when we put it in the cells was stupendo-- and you 'll appreciate our graphic graphic graphic , and it 's gone into the cells .
And we started thinking that we couldn 't go beyond , but we tried to get more in there .
This is one of the major mechanisms of evolution .
We discovered that a lot of species have added a second or a chromosoma somewhere , add in a second thousand new tracks in a second thousand new tracks .
So who think about evolution as a gene and the time you have no way to engage that 's not a lot of the biology .
They 're going to be restripping me to be a restripping that I add to be digerate DNA .
The chromosoma that was in the cells .
The cell phone , the chromosoma that we have inserito--------------------------------cell cell phone .
It 's expressed , and he recognized the other chromosoma as the existed material , and we 've got a brought , and we 've got all the new cell and the new chromosoma .
It became blue because of the genes we 've inserted .
And in a short leverage of time , all the characteristics of a species are gone , and you transformed all in a new species , based on the new software that we 've been seriously seriously .
All the protects have changed , the members have changed , and when we read the genetic code code exactly what we 've transfted .
Now , this might seem to be genetic , but altering the software , but we can change things in a very , old enough ,
Now , I 've already explained that there is not about genesis -- but to progress from three million years and a half years , and I said that maybe we 're going to create a new version of Cambrian explosion of Cambrian explosion of the Cambrian explosion of this .
Why do that ?
I think it 's enough obvious when we think about our necessity .
We 're going to go to six billion and a half billion people in the next 40 years .
Right for an example : I was born in 1946 .
Now there 's three people on the planet for each exist in 1946 .
We 're getting problems now to find food , fresh water and bulus , and well-to-half billion and a half billion people .
It 's going to be more than that for nine billion .
We use more than five billion carbon , more than 30 billion baries , more than 30 billion baries .
That means hundred million baries a day .
When I call you trying to find biological processes , or any kind of process to reach them , it 's going to be a huge challenge .
We have to keep the whole of the whole emission of CO2 emimision of these materials that 's going on in the atmosphere .
At the day , thank you to the scientific discoveries in all over the world , we have a database with about 20 million genes , and I like to think that are the design components .
The electronic industry , it 's just a dozen of about components , and think about how many different things are coming out .
Our limitations are just a mainly by the biological reality and our imagination .
Now we have techniques , because of these rapid metods , in synthetization , in order to create what we call genomics .
We 're able to build a big robot that can produce a million chromosomes a day .
Think of processing these 20 million genes or different genes or to get to get to the processes , or drugs , and we can change , and we can change , and we can change , thank you , and we can change , and in the last 20 years of science .
And it 's just a standard selection .
We can choose for a possibility of survival , chemical production or fuel , or fuel production , or fuel .
This is an instantaneous instantaneous of software programmed that we 're working on to be able to seats , and design species .
Well , we don 't know how they will be .
We know exactly exactly how genetic code .
Now we 're focusing on the fuel carbon carbon generation .
You know , you know , you know , thanol was a final experiment , it 's been a finished experiment ,
We have carbon on the second and third generation that will be going to be soon in the sugar , or different value as the either either or different kinds of value as the either either generation or different kinds of value .
But the only way the only way the biology can have a great impact without increasing the cost of food and limititaries the cost of food and limitititariability to transformer CO2 in matter before , which we 're working on the process that we 're working on the first generation of the first fuel that we can have first carbon in generation in about 18 months .
The solar light bunlight with the CO2 is a metodo-- but in our discovered all over the world , we have found different metods .
This is a organism that we 've described in 1996 .
It 's going to live in the deep ocean , about 2,500 meters of the water .
They create meters from the CO2 molecular hydrogen as a source of energy .
We 're trying to understand if we can in-source CO2 , which can easily be translated to tramite , to the CO2 in carbon , to drive this process .
So , we think we might be able to increase what the basis of the basic question . " What 's the basic question . " We have , we have the modoubling mostly re-based for re--based industry .
Exactly . If you can 't do that from TED , where you can ?
It would be a main of energy .
And we 're also working for using the same metods to create instantants .
You saw this year with flu , we 're always going to go back to a year and with a dollar in less when it 's going to find the right .
I think what you can change by combinable vaccines in ancient advvaccines in ancient .
So , as the future might start seemed to look like , the tree of evolution , and I was the evolution with the synthetic bacterial cells , and finally , and infinally cells .
We 're so much from the best people .
Our purpose is to make a way of live enough long enough to try to do it . Thank you very much .
First of all I 'm going to show you , the most rapidly possible , some fundamental work , the new technology that we 've taken to Microsoft , you know , it 's very much a year ago . This is Seadragon .
It 's a local environment where you can interact is in the local level that you can interact with a huge amount of data visual data .
Here we 're seeing a lot of digital photograph with a kind of digital phoom with a kind of a zoom and continuum , for a sandwild , and I have images like we want .
And not matter how big the amount of information that we see , how big this is the amount of of data or images or images .
Most are common photographs , but this for example is a scanning from the Biary of the Congress , and recome into the gamage of 300 megaxiety , and recome into the gamel of 300 megaxiel .
It doesn 't make any difference because the only thing that the prestations of a system like this is the number of pixel on your screen in any time . It 's also a very flective architecture . It 's also a very flessible architecture .
This is a book , or , for example , not of the data not images .
This is the Casa desolate of Dickens . Every colonna represented a capital .
To show you that it 's just about text and not images , we can do something like this , to actually see that it 's a real representation of the text , not a picture .
It might be a little artificial to read a book .
Not a advice .
This is a more realistic example . It 's a number of the Loodian .
Each image is the beginning of a sex .
And it really gives you the pleasure and the behind the real real version of a magazine or a magazine , which is for a molteplant , which is for a molteplplus .
We also did something with the corner of this number in the U.K. .
We have created a higher advertional ads -- much more than what you use in a normal advertising , and we 've inserted to the extra add .
If you want to see the characteristics of this automobile , you can see here .
Or other models , or even the specific techniques .
And this really shows some of these ideas to eliminate the limitations of space on the screen .
We hope that that that means to put up , and I 'm like to get a few , and to other porcheries , I didn 't have to be necessarily .
Of course , the map is one of the most obviously applications for this kind of technology .
And I don 't want to lose time , if we don 't mean that we have contribute to give up in this field .
These are all the streets in the U.S. , I 'm going to be a geospace-picture picture .
So now we go to something else .
This is actually the right right right from the web ; you can go to see it .
It 's a project called Photosynthetic , which combine two different technologies .
One is Seadragon and the other is a very interesting visual computer in the U.K. . I have a student of the University of Washington , with the aid of the U.S. Seitz Rick Szoooowned .
And it 's from the web , I managon the web , I 'm going to be a wild .
You can see it when we do this type of screens , where we can spend up from a image to another and have this kind of experience .
But the space collocation of images here has actually a meaningful meaningful .
The algorithms of computers have record together , and they 're all sorts of these images together , so that I think -- all the close to the side of the U.K. Montagne on the Roccious downnnes -- they 're screen . Here you see that the elements of a destick or , and these things are all the space-destand , these things have been all of space .
I don 't know if I have time to show you some other environment .
I 'm a lot more space .
I want to go directly to one of the original data of Noah-- and this is from a previous prototype of Photosynthius that we 've done for the first time , to show you what I think is really the key key key to show you what I think is really the key key key to show you what we 've put in the web .
We had to worry about legal aspects and on .
This is a re-built of Nototre Dame images in the Flickr . Basta digitness . It 's digitror , and you get images of the campus and you get images of these things in magic coni , and you know . Oach you of these coni coni coni re-a picture of this .
So I 'm all images by Flickr and I 've been all connected to this way .
And it 's possible to navigate this very simple way .
You know , I would never have thought to end to be working for Microsoft .
It 's very gratifying to get this kind of acachieve here .
I think you can see that it 's a lot of different footoches : from those of the cell phone , which is the SLR , a meanananeal , put together in this environment .
And if I can , I try to look at those more strange .
Many are blocked by faces , etc .
Somewhere I have a series of photographs -- there .
This is a poster of Notre Dame registered .
We can go from the poster to the physics of this environment .
The essential point is that we can do things with social environment . This is now taking data from the whole memory of the collective thing to the world , from the collective point of view -- and connected all those data together together .
All those pictures become connected together , more than the sum of the parts .
You have a model of the land that emerge .
Think about this as a prolungment of Stephen Lawler on Earth virtual .
It 's something that 's going to grow in complexity as people use , and the which advantage to the use .
Their pictures are marked with metadicals from other people .
If you get somebody comes the idea of contracting all these sunts , I know the name , my pictures of Nototprint Dame improviously areas of all those data , and I can use the same data , and I can use to be able to use of the same data , by using the picture of anyone else , and you have a kind of a cross-user experience of a red , and you have a byuser .
Of course , a consequence of all this is very , virtual models of every interesting , in the land , you don 't just have to be plane and you know , and you know , and you know , but from the memory and similar images and similar images .
Thank you .
Chris Anderson : I realized what your software is that your software is that to be a certain point , in the next years , all of the next years , all of the next years , all of the interior will be connected together ?
BAA : Yeah . What 's doing is doing is basically to find out .
It 's creating of hyperlinks , if you want , you , in images .
And it 's doing it in the bottom of images .
The thing is really interesting if you think about the rchemical rches of information that many of these images .
As when you do a research of the web , you have a phrase and the text on the web has a lot of information about images .
Now , what if that 's going on on to all your pictures ?
So the amount of semantic interconnection and the amount of riches that 's really huge . It 's a classic effect of the network .
CA : Blaise , it 's really amazing .
BAA : I thank you very much .
One of the main pleasure when you travel and one of the search of search , is the able to live between who has not forgotten the antial traditions , in the wind , you have the past in the wind , you touch the wind and levert-bits , leaving the floor , you in the leaving of plants .
Bastes think that the Jaguar travel , and that the idea that the Via Lattea , or that the Inuit 's still a collim of meaning , or that in Himalaya , the budddamage , and that the idea that the central of the Dharm , but that the idea that the central world of anthropology , and that the idea that the world 's not just a model , but it 's just a model , but it 's just a model of reality , but it 's just a model , but it 's just a lot of of reality ,
the consequence of a particular set of adaptative choices that our stypes did , well or bad , many , many generations ago .
And , of course , we all share of essential tracts .
We all proof it . We all procreation .
We 're subjects to start .
We have to deal with the inexorability of death , so we don 't surprised if we 're going to sleep and wheless .
We all have a art .
What it 's the particular song of the song , the rhythm of the song of every culture .
It 's not care that they are the Penan of the Borneo , or the following Vodoo , or the gries of Haiti , or the desert Kenya , or the desert Kenya , or a campaign in the heart of the Ande , or a camps in the heart of the Sahara .
He was my journey of my journey in the desert a month ago , or a yak of yak in Qomolangle , on Everest , the dea mother of the world .
All of these populations teaches us that are other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , other ways of moving in the world .
And , if you think , you know , it 's a concept that it can give you hope .
And then , the myriads of the world creating a ragnote of the world , they create a spiritual life and it 's important for the well-being of the planet as the planet as the ragnote as biosphere .
And you can think about this reverage of cultural ethnosphere and you can definitely definitely definitely be the sum of all the concepts , dreams , inspirations , intuitions , intuitions , intuitions , intuitions , intuitions ,
The etnosphere is the fantastic patriage of humanity .
It 's the symbol of what we are and what we can be in how much species .
And because the biosphere was a gravly consumed , as it has been very quickly , and it 's very quickly more rapidly .
Nobody 's been or for example , it would say that 50 percent of all species has been or is on the orders of the exintion of the exintion , but in the most apocalm -- in the most apocalm of the biological diversity -- and you don 't even get close to the most optitimistic -- that 's the cultural diversity .
The indicates everything is , of course , the language persites .
When you 're born 6,000 languages on this planet .
One language is not composal by a vocabolary or a series of rules .
One language is the human spirit .
It 's the middle of the animal of every culture comes in in the world .
Each language is a forest of the mind , a thought , a thought , a thought , a thought , a thought , a thought of a spiritual possibility .
And of those 6,000 languages , as we 're sitting in Monterey , at least half the half of them .
They 're not taught to kids , the people who want to say , at least that 's not going to sell something , which are already death .
What is more sad than the silver is that we 're going to be the last to talk about a language , not to transportation the wisdom of the saggeness of the children ?
This is a few of the world 's been a few of some of the world every two weeks : every two weeks , every two weeks , and a door , and a hanange language .
And I know somebody who 's going to say , " is it better ?
The world is not a better place if we 're talking about all the same language ? " Benissim , then we talk about all yoruba . We talk about the dotonese .
Let 's talk about kogs .
You 'll see a stract thing that means we can 't talk about your language .
I would like to do a journey through the etnosphere .
a little journey in the etnosphere to give you a stage of what we 're losing .
Many of us are forget that when I say , " different ways of exist , " I mean , really different ways of exist .
We take for example this bimbo Barasana , in the settle of the anacond , the popular of anacond , which creates the myth of the anacond of the west in the west pants .
It 's a popular that 's not able to distinguess the blue color from the green falls because the time you 're identified in the forest , which depends .
They have a strange language and a major rules , detect " exogamia " : you have to save a person who talked about a different language .
All of this has radical past mitologic , yet , yet the particularity is that in these families are now now now six or seven languages , which is that in these expensive , no one language .
They 're limitate to listening and then start talking .
We take one of the most interesting tribes I 've lived , the Waorans of Ecuador , the Waorans of Ecuador , an incredible popular that had the first contacts in 1958 .
In 1957 , they have tried a construct construct a mistake .
They did sending out the top photographs that they were reraft , they were reporting that this popular of the forest rainforest had never seen anything bi-dimensional forests had never seen anything bi-dimensional .
They collected the picture of the earth , they 've got to research a shape or a shape , and not found nothing , they 've concluded that they were treated with the horders .
But the Waorans don 't kill the southern .
They kill them in the way .
The 54 percent of the mortality was caused by them .
We 're sitting at eight generations and we found two death , and when we 've been reported to know that one of them was invecent , and they had been born so that he died , and then they kill him , and then they killed him him him , and then they had an incredibly , and they had an incredibly unbelievency of the forest .
The cause they were able to recognize the animal at 40 steps and recognize the species .
In the early ' 80s , I 've been assigned a really interesting compask when my professor of Harvard , if I wanted to go to Haiti to Haiti to be in Haiti to be a secret with the base of Duvalier and Tonton Macooling and impossessed my head of bone .
To give a sense of the myracolost , I would have to understand the Vodoo culture . And that Vodoo is not magner .
It 's quite a pretty much of a metaphor of the world .
It 's very interesting .
If I ask you to tell me the great religions of the world , what would you say ?
Cristianesimum , Islam , Buddism , Ebbbysm , etc .
A continent is always left out , thinking that the sub-Sharian Africa doesn 't have any religious feeds . And they 're the Vodoo is not the other than the distilside of these religious concepts in the tragic religious sense .
What makes the interesting voodoo is the intense of the life and death .
So the vision they have to hide the spirits .
The spirites can be invoced by the Grande Acqua , they response to the rhythm of the dance of the soul and the temporary of the soul of the vial soul the goal that 's going to be the becomes .
So , for this , the voodooists like to say , " You know , " You know , " Do you know , " God .
We give them in the temple and dead God . "
And from the moment that you 're sitting , is the spirit that you , how can you do it ?
So you 're seeing incredible events : following the voodoo in the state of trance that touch impunts , and you have a pretty strong demonstration of the power of the body when it 's catalized in a state of extreme .
In all the populations with which I lived the most extraordinary is the Kogi of Sierra Nevada Santa Mars , in the Santa Mars , in the settle .
Inscendent of the ancient civilization that once once they were living on the caraibic plants , the popular of the Colombia in the conquicist , the popular massive wild playing on the vulcycle .
In a smackey continent , this popular continent , this popular , this popular .
But there are some of the way , but they have been a very extraordinary .
The young people follows are coming out of the families to three or four years , and they live secregate in a good world , and hombrought in a buy world of the glaciers for 18 years .
Two periods of nine years choices to reproduce the nine months of the noine months of the agreement that transformed in the the user of the mother , now are metaphor the user of the Grande Mother .
For all that time , they 're accultured to values of their society , values that they predict their play and only their preglacier , and only their preglorious , or to say the equilibrio .
At the incredible of this initiation , they 're suddenly layed out and for the first time in their 18 age , at the age of 18 years , they see a very active block , when the sun is the values of the first block , all of the same landscape , all that they learned in theory is consciously refed in the theory .
" Where ? Proprist as I said .
It 's amazing . Now it 's amazing . It 's a protect .
They call a bigger brothers and say that we , the minors , we are the collished of the world .
This is extremely important .
When we think of Ingence populations and the invoice of the noble populations , and the old story of the noble wildness , which is a concept of the noble concept in his simplicity , I 'm going to be more closer to the Earth .
The Ingenes are not not feeling .
There 's no space for these things in the Asmall-malarial pales or the gelids of Tibet , but thank you to the time and the rules , they have created a mystical mystics of the Earth 's not the concept of the Earth 's not not the same .
What does it mean ?
It means that a girl of Ande who grow up in the Ande that the mountain is a spirit of Apu that will be a destiny . It 's a different human being destoundly different than the mountain with the mountain or the place that it 's a different mountain of rock that 's a mountain .
That 's the dimora of a spirit or a mineral , it 's irrelevant .
What 's interesting is the metaphor that defines the relationship between the individual and the natural world .
I grew up in the forests of the Britannica credating that the forests were able to be cuted .
And I made a human being different from my friends Kwakiutl who believe that the forests are the Hukuk and the bone 's histored of the paradise and the bal ball that are living at the north of the world , which are we going to have in the world , the spirites that they 're going to do during the Hamatsa .
If you start to look at that these cultures can create different reality , I could start to understand some sense of their sense .
I 've taken this picture of the nordoctor in the nordoccctually .
Maybe some of you heard of the ayahuash , the most powerful psychopoptional repertorium .
What makes it fascinating the ayahuash is not the potential of the chain , but his election . It 's composal of the check . It 's composal by two elements .
On one side , this land-bunch lian lian land-carboline , harmful and harmolines , and it 's lightlian .
Take the only plants has a bluststage that altera little bit of the consciousness , but it 's choose with the fleaves of a family of coffee said Psychotria vision of the coffee .
This plant plant , the tripptamines , very similar to the serotonin , dimethylyptamine , methoxypamine .
If you 'll ever see Yanomami , you 'll see the birth of the nose that they do a different set of species , anches are contains .
And I think that polar on the nose is a little like to be sparked by a caric fucil of dipink and landed on a sea of electricity . [ Risate not believe a destroy-up of reality .
I was often with my professor , Richard Evan Shultes , the man who has taken the psychologic , with his discovered , with his discovered in the ' 30 in Mexico .
I think my tesis , you can 't classifying these tripptamines like hallucinated because if you 're not going to tell nobody to be hallucinated .
It 's possible to be able to assumerly if you 're assumerly on the other chemicals that denize .
Now , it 's the beautiful , the Is that the cool of the MAO , the same kind of necessary to be inhip the same as you need to potential the tripal tripal . The question of the question is that we have been a flying bitear , like these popular , as these people have to find two deeper , they create a real biochemical version that 's soon a version of biochemical parts ?
We use the great eusususum of the proof of the sustake , which can reveal infrufer .
But if we ask the Indians , they 'll tell you " The plant to you . "
What does it mean ?
This tribes , the Cofan , has 17 variety of ayahuass , which are nectly in the forest , and that you would reach in the same species .
If we ask them , if they ask them , they 'll say , " I was going to tell you , " I was thinking about it , " I said , " I said , " No . "
The solution is : they take the 17 variety of a bunch and each one will a different snone .
With this is not laurea in Harvard , but it 's much more interesting that content the stami .
Now , [ applaushes the problem is that even the problem is that even the people who have to heart people find them , but in a paintorthesks , but somehow reducts in our real world , and they pass over .
In fact , the X-century , in 300 years , it 's not going to remind for his gueres or innovations , but rather as the one was where we 're stopped and active active accounted , or acceply the destroyed by the world 's a culture and cultural destruction of the planet . Now the problem is not the change .
All the cultures through the centuries have been involved in a new life .
And the problem is not the technology .
The Indians Sioux have no stopped to be Sioux when they put out and they remains so as Americans don 't have stopped to be Americans when they put out and cause .
It 's not the change or technology that 's the same as the ethnosphere . It 's the power .
The last fly of the domination .
And if you give a look at the world , I 'll find that these are not destinated .
They 're living and dynamics and dynamics out of the hyperperforces that go beyond their ability to adaptation .
I know that you have disboscratment in the pathria of Penan --
a popular nor made of Sarawak , in the airest asian , a popular that liblock in the forest to a generation , and now reduced to the servitoes , and now reduced to the reverse of the rive of the rivers that seems to be able to see the windden , where you can see the winner Borneo to the Merian . Merian , where the gysload the horizon the horizon of the horizon the horizon ,
With the stone of the stone of the subtle of the forest .
Or , in the Yanomami , are the disease that 's the disease that I got to the discovery of the gold .
If we move on the mountain of Tibet , where I 'm doing a lot of research , you 'll see the hard hard time , you see the last last flight .
As you know the genocide , the physics of a popular , is constructed to universal level , but the ethnocide , the destruction of life , not only is not just that , but it 's not just a popular , but it 's a celebrated by the development of the development of certs .
And you can 't understand the Tibet is the suffering of the Tibet until you 're in the beginning .
I have been very very much from Chengdu in Chengdu in the West through Tibet , I got to Lhasa with a young land-a-boundaries , but only come to Lhasa , I realized what 's behind .
6,000 sacres reduced in polar and cenjoy .
1.2 million people killed by military , in the Cultural Rivolution .
The father of this guy was ascritical to the Panchen Lama .
That means that it was killed to the tempts of Chinese invasion .
I 'm going to be sitting with Santity during the diaspora that 's taken the popular in Nepal .
His mother was been imprigioned and his colst was to be rejected .
It was brought to the age of two birth in the age of two birth under his gonna because he wouldn 't have to have any of him .
The sister , which did the same , it was mitted in reeducation .
A day he inavailed a day , I 've been a wild engaged by Mao and , for this transgression , it 's been mitted to the sea seven years .
The Tibet is to be inspired , but it can be inspirit , but the reest reest the present of the popular .
At the end , all you reduces a choice .
We want to live in the world world world 's the monothic , or we want to account the world polyctic ?
The great anthropologists Margaret Mead , before he died that his bigger fear was that , in our own own friendly , we 're going to see the whole gamores of human imagination reduced by a limitation of human imagination . But one day , we 're going to see that there were other possibilities .
And it 's umillion to remember that our species is exist for 60,000 years .
The Neolitic Rivolution , who gave us the agriculture , which has done us underground for the seed seed , restitude the poetry of the champ of the chaman , creating the hip of the specialization , and we talk about 10,000 years ago .
The modern industrialized world has 300 years .
That 's the story , I don 't suggests that we have answers to all the challenge that we have to deal in the millennia to come .
When you get these myriads of the world is asked what it means to be humans , they respond to be humans , they have a different voices .
And it 's in these answers that we all have to reach the possibility of being what we are : a kind of a conscious kind of a a kind of a conscious kind of optimized . And there 's great moments of optitimistic .
I 've been taken this picture of the northern extremity of the Baffin , when I went to the whaled of the Inuit , and this man , Olaya , and this man , Olaya , he told me the wonderful story of his grandfather .
The world government has not been given to the Inuit is not always gentle with the Inuit , and in the ' 50s to stbilify our , we have to hold our .
The grandfather of this man refed to go .
The family , I teming for his life , and he took it all the reports , and all his accounts .
You have to know that Inuit , they don 't temon the cold , they know .
The pattins of slitters in the origin were made of weight in the pin the pain of pain .
The grandfather of this man didn 't have been intimistic or from the library or from the library or from the library , which was a little bit .
It 's sgacting , you have been calculated with the pantalone in the ball of the faces . When I did it do it , you have a ball , you have worked a lama .
It 's got springed on the points of this coltelephone and when he became solid , he killed a dog .
It has been a sleep and created a brillighter , with the casslettt-, he 's imbrighed another dog and he 's disappeared on the bite , and he 's disappeared on the remain .
We want to talk about caving with nothing ? [ Risate ] And this , in different ways , [ Applusi is the symbol of the resilience of the Inuit and the all the Inuit 's the symbol of the world .
In the april 1999 , the English government has redied by the Inuit control of a bigger area of the California and Texas I put together .
It 's the new pathria . It 's called Nunut .
It 's a independent territory . They hold all the resources .
One of the splendies of like a national national national state can recilize with his popular .
And , I think it 's quite obvious at least in those remote in the planet , I think it 's not really really remote that they don 't have to remote .
For somebody 's home .
They represent sexual imagination that reach up the dalba . And for all of these kids , as the dreams of these kids , like the dreams of our children , they become part of the geography of hope .
From , we know , National Geographic , we have convince that politicians never come to nothing .
We believe that the polemies --
[ Applausi is not persua-persua-persua-lobe , but we think that stories are the best institution to tell stories of the world . Every month of our website has to reach 35 million visit .
156 countries transports our television .
Our rivists are thlette by millions of people .
Our work is travel to ening our own audience in places places that we 're going to have a lot of cultural places that they 're going to be able to , and , they 'll be hoped , they will be able to be able to , and they 'll find a style in the diversity of anthropology : the world 's the world of life in a pluralist and we have to find a style life in a pluralist and to find one of life in a life in a life .
where we 're all the population can help to our own own own .
Thank you .
I 'm going to talk about some things I wrote in this book that I hope to be called and I 'm going to prove some of the connections , in the case , you don 't noticed .
I want to start with what I call the dogma official dogma .
The dogma official thing ?
The dogma official , of all the Western industry , the West 's the official , " If we want to massimilar the well-being of our citizens . "
The reason is , by one side , in fact that the liberty is in itself a value , is predictive , essential for human beings .
Other is the other than we 're free , each of us can act for all of us can act for all of our well-being , without no one that we decided to be , without no one that we decided to say ,
The way to massive to massive freedom is massive to massive .
More choices , the people have , more are libites , and more is their own , more , is their well-being .
This , I think , it 's so deeply radicated in the society that nobody would have to put it in doubt .
And it 's also deeply radicated in our lives .
I 'm going to show you some examples of what progress has made possible .
This is my supermarket . It 's not particularly big .
I lose a simple note on the unununless .
I think about 175 conditions , without content 10 variety of olive . And the first one of the Golive and 12 acures that you can buy for a huge number of conditions in the inct rescore that nobody of 175 , you have a huge amount of conditions that nobody of 175 , you know , you know , you know , I 'm going to have a big deeper .
That 's the supermarket .
And then you go to the electronic store to buy a stereo : casse , in CD , radio , radio , playing .
And in this single one of the electronic store , there 's a big number of audio components .
We can make six million and a half million different fighting combinations using the components that are in one store .
You have to admit that there is a lot of choice .
Other camps : the world of communications .
Once , when I was a kid , they could get all the telephone services , to pat the pitches that were foreeded by Mom .
It was going to go .
One consequence of this , between the other , was that the phone never would break .
These days are gone .
Now , we have a variety of telephones , especially between cell phones .
That 's the cell phone .
My favorite is the middle , MP3 , tops , and the babs for the bin the bin for the brulelt .
If you don 't have seen the store under the store under the store , you 're going to come to it .
And what 's the end is that people go to the store and does this question . And you know , what the answer is " No . "
It 's not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn 't make it too much .
So , in other things that are much more important than the acquired of the budaries , you know , the same explosion of choices .
It 's a healthier : it 's not going on in the United States that you go from the doctor and the doctor of the doctor , and the doctor of the United States that you have to do .
Instead , you go from the doctor , and the doctor says , " OK , we can do , or B , or " A , " A , " A " has these benefits and these answers . What do you want to do ? "
It 's like to say , " Dotore , what would I do ? "
And the doctor says , " A has these benefits and these answers , and they have these benefits and these answers . "
" What do you want to do ? "
And you rebits : " Dotore if she was me , what would you do ? "
And the doctor : " But I 'm not going to . "
The result of the result , we call it " the maled " expression that it seemal seemal .
But it 's not that one to move the weight and responsibility to take decisions from somebody who knows something , which is the doctor , to someone else who doesn 't know anything -- and so much that 's not not , and so in the right to take the ideal decisions .
There 's a huge marketing of products , you know , they 're going to people like me and you , if you think , it 's not a sense , because we can 't buy them .
But if we can 't buy them , because they have public ?
The answer is that they want to be in the morning , we call the doctor for remajor to change the rich .
That 's a fundamental thing as our identity is a question of choice , as you see in this dream . " We don 't want to forcing kids . They 're going to give their sex at at the right time . " We need to invent .
And we can reinvented how many times you do it .
That means that every morning , you have to decide that kind of person you want to be .
I 'm going to go to the family and marriage , a long time the common , and they were almost for anyone , it was that it was that there the most soon as possible , and it started to be the longer .
The only versides was with who , not when , and not even when , and even even even what to do after .
Odly , it 's really to play .
I 'm smart students , and I do 20 percent of the work in less than a time .
And it 's not because they 're not just a brilliant , not because they are less .
but why I 'm willing , I mean , I mean , I would you have to get to me or not ? I should do it now ? "
" Do I have to marriririd of my own or career ? "
They 're logiving you logives .
And they 're trying to answer these questions , even though this implesson , even though I don 't get a bel vote and not getting a bel vote to my examples .
And they have to do that . I 'm important questions .
Now , the work : we 're lucky , like Carl , because the technology allows us to work every minute , every day , every day , from every day , from every corner of the planet , except that from the Hotel Randolph .
And I 'm talking about , there 's a corner , and I didn 't tell nobody where the WiFi works .
I don 't tell you , because I want to use it .
What does that mean , this amazing freedom of choice that we have to continue , and we have to continue , and we have to work or not .
We can go to see our son son playing with the cell phone , with the cell phone in a pockberry in the other , and the notebook , and the notebook , think on the ginock .
And even though I 'm all spent , every minute that we see our son son , we 're also asking , we 're also asking , " I have to respond to this called ? "
" Do I have to answer this email ? I have to abbozzy this letter ? "
And even when the answer is " no , " all this makes the experience of your son , very fun of your son , very different than what it would be in other conditions .
So , anywhere we look at all , little , little , and big materials and life , life is a question of choices .
Once the world was this : Ovreal , there were some possibilities , but it wasn 't a question of choice .
The world of today sounds like this : The dilemma is , " It 's a positive thing , or negative ? "
The answer is Surnce .
The positives you all , so I 'm going to talk about the negative .
All this choice is two effects two effects of the people .
The first , I 'm talking about that it 's that it 's going to be paralysally .
With a lot of options between which choose , it 's very difficult to do it .
I give you a significant example : a deal with a flying on the flap of flight .
My colleague has had access to the Vances of the Vances , the giant society , with about a million clients .
What she discovered is that for every 10 solutions that are offices in the most , percentage of adesion , the percentage of two percent .
With 50 funds , there 's 10 percent adesions , there 's only 10 percent adesions than when they are only five . Why ?
Because with 50 sources between which choose , is maledly difficult to decide , and the choice is remadied to the intomorrow .
And I still tomorrow , and I still tomorrow , tomorrow , and of course , and of course , of course , they never come .
You can 't just that that these work from old old old , because they 're not going to have enough money for the chanes because they don 't want to say that the decision is so obstical that allows the fundamental fundamental dator of work .
Not participating , they 're losing until five to five to five to five to work from the work , which would be brought to be .
So the paralysis a consequence of having too many choices .
And I think that makes the world .
" And to finish , for the eternity : ketchup , send or maion ? "
You would take the right decision , if it 's for the right decision , is it ?
You don 't want to choose the wrong wrong , and you know the wrong condition .
So this is the first effect . The second is that we can avoid the paralysis and make a choice , at the end , we 're less subsidied by the result of how we have been with less options .
And this for different reasons .
One of these is that with many of which you choose , if you buy a little bit of a , and it 's not easy to imagine that you could have been better to imagine that you could have been better . And what 's what 's going on . And what 's going on is that the alternative imagination of choice , and the replacement diminudyes , and the replacement of the choice , and the restage diant deminds of the decision that 's going on on the decision , and the replaceeding decision that you can 't have been to be better .
even when it was a good decision .
And then you get more choices , more is easy to displeasure of any details that is insodatic of option .
And also , there 's what economists call .
Dan Gilbert has closed very well as the value of things that we 're talking about what we 're talking about what we 're talking about .
Of rest , when there 's a lot of options , it 's easy to represent the characterial active , and they 're less subsidies and be less subsidies of the option that you have choice .
So , I have a school . I 've been with all the ones that are not New York .
But that 's probably what you probably think .
There 's this copy of the Hampons .
A place of lussides .
It 's very very very nice . It 's all for them . It 's all for them .
Not all . But what he thinks is , " Well , males , there 's no , I 'm Agotten . "
" All my neighbors in Manhattan is on . "
" I could talk about it right in front of the house . "
And I spend two weeks , I have a look at the idea that 's losing -- every day -- the possibility of parking where it wants .
The expensive opportunity diminufacturing the sub-disfation for what we also , when the choice is been the excellent .
And more are the options that we have to look at , more , the characteristics will come to the opportunity .
Here 's another example .
This is a lot of things .
It 's about the time , and maybe the live of the living lently .
But the most important point is that anything you choose , you go to not do other .
The things that we don 't choose to be active active , they can make less attractive what we do .
And third point : the spiral growing of the expectations .
I tried to my skin buying a new couple of jeans .
I 'm almost always jeans .
Once the jeans were just like , you buy and bought them and besting besty , they were just shooted , just after I had a life and work a lot of times , they were starting to go well .
So I went to buy a couple of when the old old old , and I said , " I need a couple of jeans , this is my cutting . "
The commitment said , " Look , you know , what 's the phones , rely fit ? "
Loook with the cerniera , with the bottons ? " Stonehed or " or " " acidjuhed ? "
" Look , " Look ? "
" His : Do you want to go and bla bla -- " Continured to elenjoy .
I was sbalored , and after a little bit , I could say , " I want the guy to say , " I want to be the only guy . " I want to have a skid , and then I tried to all jeans , and then I got out of the jeans , I have had to say , " I want to have had .
It was the massive . I had the best .
But I felt I 'm worse .
Why ? I wrote a book for understood .
The reason I was worst worst is that with all that choice was very high , the jeans had to be perfect .
I was a minme . I didn 't expect me . I was nothing exceptional , when I saw 100 different , but when I saw 100 different , accidents , at least one of them , at least a kind of must be perfect .
What I had to buy was good , but not perfect .
After I had to talk about the choose to what I was trying to be satisfaced in confronted to the wait .
The add of options in the life of the people don 't do to increase the expectations that these are respect to the options of the same .
And this will be less sodatisfaction , even when the results are good .
Nobody in the world of marketing , if you realize .
Because if they knew , you 're not aware of what I 'm talking about .
It looks like the truth looks more like this .
" It was better when you were worst , " The reason that was better when he was worst when he was worst was that when he was worst , they could meet of surprised .
Over the world we live in -- the world we live in -- opulents , industrialized , with the most performance that we can hope is that things to the altel .
You never have surprised to be surprised because your expectations , I have been unangiant .
The secret of happiness -- what you 're here -- is , " Baxis is , " You want to . "
I mean , a little biographic -- which are really ununununvision and my wife is really amazing .
I couldn 't do better , I don 't have to do better , I 'm not acked .
But it 's not always a good thing .
Finally , a consequence of buy a couple of jeans , when there 's just that when you have a jeans is that when you 're not satisfacts , and you ask , " Why ? "
" Who is responsible ? " , the answer is close .
The world is responsible . What can I do you ?
When you have hundreds of jeans , and you buy a satisfacing , and you ask you who are responsible , it 's the clear , it 's the clear that the responsible you .
You could do better .
With hundreds of variety available , there are not scuse for the insuccess .
So when people take decisions , even though the result is the alid , they feel insoddisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisappear , they feel indeed .
In the last years , the depression is explose in the world industry .
I think a significant factor -- not the only one , but important -- of this depression is that the people have experiences , because the standard of people have experiences because it 's too high .
And when they have to explain this situation think that the colst is they think that they 're going to be .
So the final result is that we 're better , we 're better , objectively , but we feel worst .
Let 's remember .
This is the official dogma , what we all take for good and it 's completely flew . It 's not true .
There 's no doubt that a little choice is better than I 'm going to be better than I have to do that , but it 's not a little bit better than a little bit .
There 's a critical value , I don 't know what it is .
But I 'm sure we 've super--scale that we 've super-scale the level that choices better .
Now , from the political point of politician -- I 've been a political point , the nocctually , the noccctually , the noccctually , I 've been a lot of political view ,
What it allows this to the industrial society is the material rechef .
There are many places in the world , and you know , you know , where the problem is not that they have too many choice .
The problem is that they have too few .
So the factorial factorial that I 'm talking about is a malable to be exclusive of modern society .
And what it does to depress and climbs is this : Steve Levitt you talked about how much the expensive and discovered with the babs are useful . It 's a spre-sprite of money .
I mean that these choices , complicated and avooods , it 's not that they 're simply unuseful .
I 'm a dollar wild .
They do them worst .
If a little bit of what in our society allows , it was reversed in the people who have too much more possibilities , it won 't only have their life to better , but even our own life .
This is what economists call a better better better .
A redistribution of income re-income re-distribution , not only to the poor -- because of this choice in excess that we 're going to .
And to conclude , " You can be all of what you want to do . "
You know , people of culture , you think , " But what 's creates that fish ? "
" It 's obvious that you can 't make anything in a glass . "
" A imagination castrated , a limited view of the world --
and I 'm going to be the whole thing , at the beginning .
But then , I think , instead , I realized that what the short knows the long knows .
Because the reality of the fact is that if you mand in frantums , so that we can 't be able to be able to do .
If you break the box of the boundaries , so that we can deminuddisfation .
You can get the paralysis , and you reduced the well-being .
Everybody needs a sphere .
This is almost certainly too far , maybe even for the fish , and you know , but it 's sure for us .
But the above some symbolic sphere is a recipe for infelity and , for the roof .
Thank you very heart .
