So , last year I showed these slide slide to show that the calott-dolphins , that 's glacial , that for almost three million years , he had the size of 48 .
But it 's a subvalley of the problem because it doesn 't show the problem because it doesn 't show the exhibit of the ice .
The artical calottical calculus , in a sense , the pyeless of the global climate system .
You can extend of extend and extend of extreme .
The next slide will be a quick carrelated to the past 25 years .
The ice acks are drawn in red .
As you can see , you go down to the blue wall .
That 's the ice in inverny , which is the summer .
You can see that the soil the pyon the top of five years or more , is as blood , which is as blood , which is as the blood .
And in 25 years , it 's been so much .
This is a problem because the retired of the entire entire ground . The glaciated around the ocean where there are huge amounts of carbon congle where there are huge amounts of carbon .
I 'm going to spect the totality of the atmospherent from global warming , that amount could be doubled , super----to-----to----to---to---to-wall .
And in some lagey profound in Alaska meter is already rebulting from the water .
The professor Katey Walter of the University of Alaska team in the University of Alaska team in the last last last inveral .
Video : Wow ! Al Gore : I 'm good . I 'm going to be if we 're going to be .
And it 's why this exchange change the Groenland from the northern Groenland from the northern North .
This is a record in the glacial fiume .
The took took never had to flivels .
This is the Kangerlussuaq , in the west of the Groenland .
If you want to know how the sun of the sea level of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the sea .
These are degree .
The other part of the planet : Antarm , the largest block of the planet .
The month , the scientist scientists have dikey that the bilange of the ice is in negative , and that the Antarctle , which poges on some of the sunleun , is particularly quickly , is particularly fast .
Eququa six feet of the level of the acque , like Groenland .
Himalaya , the biggest block of ice , you see new lagey , which is a few years ago , they were glacier .
40 percent of the population of the world 's population half of the world 's population .
Sulle Ande : this glacier is the source of water .
The reported it .
But when it comes , it 's the same happens to the water water .
In California the nenow , the Sierra Nevada is diminured 40 percent .
The hydrowers are in crisis .
The predictions , as you have read , they 're good .
The growth of security in the world door to a remarkable .
The environmental disaster are increasing a riter , and it 's a normal and without precedental .
Four times more numberoes in the last 30 years , I 've been a 275 .
This is a whole of insustainable .
If you look at the historic context , if you can see the consequences .
In the last five years we added 70 million tons of CO2 every 24 hours -- 25 million tons in the ocean every day .
Look at the Eastern area of the oriental , the American American , to the Indian area , to go into the subject of the Indian continent , where there 's a radical imor of oxygen in the ocean .
The major cause of global warming , together to deforestation , which is 20 percent , it 's the use of fossil fuel .
The oil is a problem , and the carbon is even worse .
The United States are one of two countries with more emissions , together to China .
And it was propond of building many other central carbon .
But we are assisting a direction of a direction .
These are the anullated projects in the last few years and some of the versus of the versus of the last few years and some of the versus .
And so , there 's a very quickly political in our country .
The carbon of carbon and oil have spent 250 million dollars in the last year to promote carbon , which is a bunch of pulit , which is a oxygold .
And the picture of me remember something --
And I 'm Natal , in Tennessee , where I live , there was a loss of 3.8 billion liters of last carbon .
Maybe you saw on the news .
This is the second largest flow of last fluss in America .
It 's successful around Natal .
The publicity of one of the carbon industry was this .
Video : I 'm going to be a carbon , it 's a kind of allegro and happy .
It 's abundant here in America , and it 's growing our economy .
Frororosty the carbon is more cleaning .
It 's good price , adorable and the work , they 're going to be the path .
Al Gore : The way here is a lot of the carbon of West Virginia .
The biggest minerary society on mountain , Massey Coal . This is his administrator .
Video : Don Blakenship : I 'm going to be able -- Al Gore , Nancy Pelooid , Harry Reid -- they 're not talking about .
Al Gore : So the Alleance for Protext of Clima has two campaim .
This is a part of them , a part .
Video : Actor : Acky COALergy , we see the climate change as a minack-minack-up business business .
So , our priority is investing a big amount of money in a adversion of money in a adversion of money in a publicity .
In fact , carbon 't it 's not sporite .
We think it 's pulit -- it has a good profum .
So , not precummmmful of climate change .
Let me do it .
Video : Acore : Carbone , you 've heard a lot of talk about .
So we 're going to make a turn into a structure at the time for the pulit of how much much much much about carbon .
Straordinary ! The machines are a little rumorous , but that 's the sound of the pulit technology .
The carbon consumption is between the main cause of global warming , but the remarkable technology of carbon , but the pulit technology that you see it .
You look at a : this is the odiergn technology of carbon .
Al Gore : Inally , the alternative , the positive alternational security and the national security .
Video : The U.S. is in crisis ; the economy , the national security , the national climate crisis .
The fix that the connects all : our dependence from fossil combustible fossil and oil oil oil oil for the practice and oil oil .
Now , there 's a new , audace solution for using circucured .
Repower : 100 percent of the pitches , in 10 years .
A plan to reput America at work , and it makes us sure more , and help us stop the global warming .
And so , a solution that we basts to solution our problems .
Really America . It 's more than more .
Al Gore : This is the last .
Video : It 's about require to America .
One of the most faster ways to take us to dependence from the combustible combustible that we can kill our planet .
Comparts : The future is here . I 'm going to , a new energy network .
Comparse : Nubled investment for places of work ,
Never America . It 's time to be reality .
Al Gore : A old old old old , you know , if you want to go to fast , you go from sold .
If you want to go away away , you go together . "
We have to go away away , fast .
Thank you very much .
Last year at TED , I did a introduction on the LHC .
And promise to get back to the way to get back to how the machine works .
So , what I was going to do . And for those that the other time , there were no , the LHC is the biggest scientific experiment , ever , in the other time .
His compask is to reach the conditions that were at less than a billion of a billion than a second from the beginning of the universe -- until to 600 million times a second .
All of it 's just environmental .
This is the Ginevra .
We 're going to have these min-Big Bang in the remarkers .
This is what I work . It 's called ATLAS -- it 's about 44 feet and it 's a 22 feet and it 's a 22 feet .
This is a spect picture of ATLATLAS in building so you can see proportions .
To 10 to settember the year we have acceso the machine for the first time .
And this picture was scattattaced by ATLAS .
It was because of immense festeggiving in control .
It 's a picture of the first fascinating particles that had done all the around the LHC , entering in collision , dollar particles in the relevant .
In other words , when we see that image 10 to settember , we realize that the machine , which is a big vice .
I don 't know if this was this to make us exultate more or this , when somebody went on on Google , and I 'm going to be this .
That means we had a cultural impact beyond on the scientific impact .
And so , a week after , it was a problem with the machine , they had to these fix here -- these fix here .
These fili are 13,000 print when the machine works at the massive of the power of the power of the potence .
Now , the technical technique of you will look at the fix and say , " It 's not true . I 'm fix too much too much . "
And instead can do it because when they 're very frequently becomes the cool cool .
So , at least 271 degrees , at least 271 degree , in the space between the stars , these fix can bring that run that run .
In one of the giuntures between the most of the magneti magneti in LHC , there was a phabycle of a phabycle .
So the fix fix , and they 're going to read it , and 13,000 , they were improvised a electrical resistence .
This was the result .
Now , this is more impressive if you think that these magneti fish more than 20 tons , and you 've been moving about 30 centimeters .
They 're drugs about 50 magneti .
We had to take them , what we did .
We repressed and enrise .
They are now now recently , all of their place .
By the end of march the LHC will be again again .
We 'll accurate it , and we expect to get the data of the right or the labor or , and continuing our adventure to discover what are morons are morning that are morons that are morning that are the universe .
Now , of course , in a way , these accidents retained in the value of science and engineering and engineering in front of science and engineering in front of science and engineering .
I think the fact that it 's so hard , the fact of the fact of the things like LHC .
I want to end with the words of a Inglese scientist , Humphrey of the words of inspiring , which , in difense of inuseful experiments of his puppiles , his Michael Faraday , he said , " Nist , " Niest is a lot of dangerous science to the progress of human mind . "
Thank you .
I want to start to start to ask you to start to rethink of when you , you know , children , played up with the morning .
While you can understand how to reach them , and get them , and you know , and you know , you know , and you know , we 're actually going to be able to think and solve problems .
So , the space is very very , very , very connection to the way we understand a part of the world around us .
So , from the information useful of our interaction with physical objects , together to my physical consultant , and my collaborator Jeevan Kalanithi , I started to ask ask ask ask ask ask , " And if we use a computer , instead of having the couse , as we use just a computer , but we use a little digital wising , we could be a non---writing , we could be the brought of the wild ,
and siststly it up ?
The question was so interesting that we decided to explore the answer , and the answer , and it 's Siftable .
In a few words , a Siftis a whole computer interactive as a biscopic computer .
In a few words , a Siftis a whole computer interactive as a biscopic computer .
And you can move with your hand , you can see , " between them , " You know , " between their motion and they have a screen and a wireless .
But it 's basically , the physical objects , as morning , you can move it simply , you can move it simply .
The Siftable is an example of a new ecosystem to manipulate the digital information .
And as they become more physical , conscious of the other , and other , and as a lot of other , and as they become more physical , conscious than other , we can explore new and different ways of interaction .
I 'm going to start with some simple example .
This Siftable is configurate to show video : if you put it into a direction , the video ruption , the rotable video .
These reactive reactive , they 've got to other people .
If you deal with them , they 're interested in what they 're around .
If you 're circumsted , and they can do a little bit .
If you 're circumsted , and they can do a little bit .
They also have their motion and inlination .
We realized that one of the most implications of the interaction was to be able to use common on data , for example , " for example , " a color like , " a liquid a liquid .
In this case , we have three Siftable as a bunch of greattail and I can use them to the color in that central , where you mix .
and I can use them to the color in the central , where you put them .
If we 're too much , we can put it a little place .
I 'm also a beautiful chance of appreciation , as language , the mathematics and games where people can try to try and logic . where people can try and and see the immediately .
I 'm ...
This is a sequence of Fibonacks that I do with a program of equations .
Here we have a game of words that 's half a game between Scarabeer and Boble .
So , at every turn-re-re-re-put letter in any Siftable , Pratically , you had a letter to each other , you get a letter .
Then , after about 30 seconds of a new set of reading and new possibilities to read and new possibilities to try .
Thank you .
Here 's how many of the kids came to Media Lab , I did it in a way that I tried them and I went to a video .
They are very much .
And one of the interesting things of this kind of application is that not to people in education .
You just say , " Compones of words , " and they 'll be exactly what to do .
Here 's how many people who try it .
This is our younger tester , and the younger .
It was just wanted to impilling them .
They 're only morning , for him .
Now , this is a application of a interactive paper .
We wanted to build a tool for the appriction of language Lui is Felix .
It can insert new characters in the scene , and it 's brought their associated .
It can insert new characters in the scene , and it 's brought their associated .
So , it 's doing the sun .
Video : The sun is source .
David Merrist : Now she brought a treator in the scene .
Video : The treator treator .
Bel work ! Yeah !
So eight schools and put closer can interact the characters --
Video : Bau !
-- inventing their own history .
Video : Hao !
DM : It 's a story with the open--------year-old .
DM : It 's a story with the open--------year-old .
Video : Very on , throat it .
DM : The last example I have the time to show you is a tool , and I made of recent , to sample and execting music .
It 's a tool , it made of recent , to sample and execting music .
The Siftable here are aging from sounds like the basis and bacteria .
Everyone of these has four different variations , and you can choose what to use .
You can also put these sounds in a sequence from you to get your pleasure .
And I 'm going to take a sound , and a sequence . "
These are actually , you can control from the vial , as the reverbero and the filter and the filter .
The attacks to a particular sound , and then inclens to travel it .
And then there are the general effects as time and fly , that you 're applicating to intersequence .
Let 's look like it works .
Video : We 'll start using a basis in two Siftable sequence , we 're going to be in a series , we 're going to put on the other base .
Now I put a baseline line .
Video : I add of percussions --
Video : And I 'm going to put the bacteria , so I can control the bacteria , so I can control the effect from the vial .
Video : I can be fast the intersequence of the intersequence , the way from one side or another .
Video : And I 'm going to add the video , I 'll add the expression to give more expression .
Video : I can recombine the sequence , " at the light . "
So I don 't have to plan it before , but I can improvisate , and it 's more and over the longer .
And now , finally , I can spend the entire sequence , the British Siftable on the left Siftable . "
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is to build new new new interfaces of our brain and more sounds like our brain and body .
And today , I had time to show you one of the results of this , and also some possibility that we try to bring out from the lab .
The concept I want to transmention is that 's coming from this new generation of objects to interact with digital media , which will bring information in our world in the way we want .
Thank you very much .
I don 't see the now of talk about all of you .
I 'm a wrote .
I 'm going to be books is my profession , but it 's more than that , of course .
It 's also love and the fascination of my life .
And I don 't expect that it can change .
But , I said that , something particular happened in my life and my career , and my career , which has taken me to return the interior report with this work .
The particular thing is I 've been wrote this book , this biography called " Mangia , Pra , " which , diversity from my precedent , and I 'm going to use it in the world and became a great feelational , bestler .
And the result is that everywhere is now , people are treatment .
And it 's a deaths .
They 're going to be all worried and they say , " You don 't have fear to do it more than I do ?
You have no likely to be able to write for all life without able to create a book that could be able to create a book that could be to be to somebody ? "
that can be important to somebody ? "
It 's rassured , you know .
But it could go worst , I remember that I remember that more than 20 years ago , when I started to say people -- I was a wrote -- I wanted to be a wrote .
I was in the same reaction reaction .
And people said , " I don 't have to be successful ?
You don 't care that the ulilights killed you ?
You have no fear to do this to the whole whole life , no one came out and dead on a cure of a dream of a cure of a dreams of the pic .
So , you know .
The answer -- the short answer to all these questions is , " Yes . "
Yeah , I 'm fear of all of those things .
I 've always had fear .
And I also fear of many other things that people can 't inate .
As the algae and other things .
But , as it was about that I thought and I was , and I 'd say , and I have a last thing is why ?
Is it rational ?
It 's a logic that anyone dealing from a job that you know , I was bored by a job that you know .
But what is that particular in the impress creative , and it 's about the mental health mental health care .
How father , he was a chemical engineer and not remember one time in her 40 years of activity in which the 40 years of activity in which the people who was asked if you 're fear to engineer ?
There was never -- that block of the engineer John , how goes on ?
It didn 't work that , you know ?
Onestly , the chemicals like a group of not have certainly , in the seuble reputation of being alcocolized .
We have a writers , we have enough enough to this reputation , and not just writers , but creative reputation of them , we have this reputation of being enormous instable .
And it 's not the other that look at the triad of the deaths of the magniques of the magniques of the creative century , they die young and often .
And the ones that are not suicians are really disfacing from their dunes .
Never Mailer , before he died , in the last interview said , " Every little bit of a little more " an extraordinary of the work of their life .
But we don 't bate when we hear that because we 've heard these things that are so much about that in some way we have completely interiorized and accepted the notion that creativity and suffering are some of the way of reading and the art , at the end , the end , the end , it will always be to the ange .
And the question I want to take all of today is : are you agree with this idea ?
And it 's good , because it also looked at a centimeter of a distance to me not good for this supposed position .
I think it 's odious .
And I think it 's dangerous and I don 't want to see the perpetuated in the next century .
I think it 's better to encourage our big creative minus .
And I know , I know , in my case -- it would be very dangerous to start to fire that I feel of supposed to be able to be able to start with the circumstances that are in my career .
Ovice -- I 'm quite a few of them , I 'm quite a young , I 'm quite a few years .
I still have about four decades of work in me .
And it 's very likely that I writing it will be right from the world as the work that I 'm used to be jugged after I spent my last book .
I 'm going to slavt , because we are all more or less friends here -- it 's likely my greater success is my own .
Oh , Gesus , who thought !
You know , this is the kind of thinking that leads a person to start to buy the wild of the morning and I don 't want to do it .
I would continue to continue to do this work we .
So , the question is that , as ?
And so I think , after many reflessions , that the way to work to continue to continue to write is that to create a psychologic , OK ?
I have some way to find a distance of security between me , I 'm write , and my natural anxizy that I wrote that I wrote to get out of the last year , I 'm trying to find other society to see , and I 'm trying to find other society to see if they could have the best ideas and more sane and more and more sane .
And as to help people creative to make people creative inerent inerent people to create creativity .
And that research has taken me to the Grek and ancient Rome .
I 'm going to go through me and then back .
The Grek Grek and the ancient and the ancient people don 't seem to believe that creativity was in men , OK ?
And it was thinking about creativity was this spirit , and that came from men from a few people who were from a few distant source and unknown , for reasons .
The green were called these these spirites of the creating creating creativity of creativity .
You look , amazing , amazing , he believed to have a demon that elargy wisdom from away away from away from away from away away .
The Rohands were of the same idea , but they called the the sort of spirit without a genius .
The one is great , because the Rohands didn 't think that a genius was somebody who was particularly intelligent .
They think that a genius was this sort of devine , which was living in the murs of a study of a artist , a little like the elpho Dobby , and that they were income out of hired the work of the artist , and to model the result of the artist , and the result of that work .
Here 's the distance of the way I 'm talking about -- that 's the distance of which I 'm going to be a psychologist you protecting you from the result of your work .
And all they knew that was that it was , right ?
So the anti-artists were protected by certain things , like for example , too much , for example , too much , no ?
If your work was except you couldn 't take all the time , you could all know that the wild , all of course they knew that they were helped by this incorporate .
If your work failed , it wasn 't all your own , right ?
Everyone who was your genius to be a inable .
And so people han conceived creativity in Occient for a long time .
Then the Rinascition came and everything , and it was boring , and nacks this big idea ; we put the human being in the center of the universe and the mysters and no longer space creatures and no longer space to creatures that they writing from divinity .
This was the principal of humans and people started thinking about creating and people started thinking about creating creativity , and they started to think that creativity was completely from the ilikely .
And for the first time in history , you start to referirse to this or that artist as a rather than a genius .
And I have to say , I think it was a big mistaining .
I think I allow somebody , a simple person to believe that we 're like a recipient as a source , the essence and the source of all the mysteries , creble and unknown as a recible , and eternable and ethernable and etherdes is a very big to give to the fragile of human beings .
It 's like to ask somebody to ingoal .
Deform and demal , and it creates all these ingestablized ases about performance .
And I think it was this pressure to have been destruct the artists in the spent 500 years .
And , if that 's true , and I think that 's , the question is , and now ?
Can we do it .
Maybe I 'm going to get a more ancient understanding of human relationship between human relationship between human relationship between human relationship between human relationship between human relationship between human relationship between human relationship between human relationship between human relationship between human relationship between human relationship between human relationship between human relationship between human relationship between human relationship between human relationship between human relationship between human relationship between human relationship between human relationship between human relationship between human relationship between human relationship between
Or maybe no .
Maybe we can 't have 500 years of rational thinking in a 18 minutes .
And there are people in the audience that would be the lawyers would be scientific sospspread about the notion of , you know , they 're going to follow people to spend up with their projects .
I 'm going to be all about this thing .
But the question I 'd like to take is -- why no ?
Why don 't I think about this way ?
Because it 's more sense of anything that has ever heard to explain the explanning of the imprevedibility of creative process .
A process that , as anyone who ever I 've been trying to do something -- so , basically , all here -- you know , it 's not a rationally .
And , in fact , it can sometimes seem to be completely paranormful .
I did this inagainst recently Ruth Stone , who has now 90 years , but he was a few years , but that was a few years , but he was a poeter for all of life and said that during her infants in the rural Virginia , and he felt it was out , and he was out of the landscape .
He said that it was like a fragricous tracy .
And that was rotoling to her from the landscape .
He felt it , because he was trying to get the earth under his feet .
He knew that was one thing to do that point and it was , words , " You know , " to run as a matta . "
And so he goes home and she was infollowed by this poetry , and it would not have to take a piece of paper and a math , and a math enough , and it was reach to the page .
And then , you could not be enough enough enough , so correcrecreceived and correcrecrecreceived and the rotoly , and the rotoly , and she would continue to reach through the landscape , looking at the landscape , looking for , to how she said , " another poet . "
Then there were times -- this piece of not dimentize it -- there were some of the times I 'm going to be almost lost , OK ?
So , he was a house and he was looking at the downnny and the poetry , and he was a math in the while he was going , and then said , that it was like if you go back with the other hand and the offer .
And he was the poetry from the coda and remajor in his body and transclearly on the page .
And in these cases , the poetry would be presented on the perfect page and intact but by contrast .
So when I hear you thought -- it 's crazy , it 's exactly the ugual of my creative process .
Not all my creative process -- I 'm not a constructing !
I 'm a mule , and my way to work is ; you know , you get me at the same orary every day and I 'm going to go and work and I spent it up there .
But I even have a lot of my woowin , I 've been striped against that thing , sometimes .
And I imagine that many of you have the han .
You know , even if the work and ideas were to be to be given you to be a certain source , you can 't know it .
And what is that ?
And how can we relate it in a way to not make us your head , but rather , rather , rather , that we make us us to be sleep ?
And as much about , the best example , I 'm the best example , I 'm the best musician Tom Waits , which I 've interviewed different years ago for a day .
We were talking about this , and you know , Tom , for the major of life has been the incarnation of the incarnation of the injeckle , trying to control , to start , to start , to start , to dominate these species of impulves .
But then I 'm going to invecting , and a day , and a day , and a day , he was driving on a Los Angeles , changed everything for him .
He was going to be fast and everything of a little bit of a tract . This little framement of melodia , which is the inspiration , and the wild , and it wants , and the result , and the dest , and the desidera , but it 's amazing , but it 's amazing , and the dest , but it 's a little framethous framing .
It 's not a piece of paper , it doesn 't have a math , it 's not a recorder .
So I started to hear this sort of old old old old , and he said , " I 'm going to lose , and I 'm sessionated by this sessionated .
I 'm not good enough and I can 't make it . "
And instead of going to go into the panic ,
I 'm going to be the whole process and he made something completely new .
I 'm just going to look at the sky and said , " Scause , you know , I 'm not driving ? "
" You know that it 's going to write a song ?
If you really want to exist , you get a moment of a moment when I can take me me for you .
And you 're going to be able to be qualcause another today .
I went to disturbing Leonard Cohen . "
And his process of working after this .
It wasn 't the work , the work was still dark .
But the process , and the anxious anxious , and the genius , and the genius , the genius that out of him out of him , and it was going to be remajor back from where , and it was going to be , realized that that it didn 't have to be a interized thing and hone-to-mented .
but you know , it 's a little bit , wonderful bizarre , a conversation between Tom and this strange and this strange and exterms that it was not Tom .
So , what I was thinking about it , and I 'm going to change a little bit about the way I was working and I was going to save me a time .
This idea , I was going to save me when I was writing " Mangia , " and " Ama , and I 'm going to be a disperation where we 're working on something and we can 't start to think that 's going to be a disaster , which is going to be the worst book .
Not just good , it 's worst book .
And I started thinking about giving this project .
But then I remember to Tom who talked about the air and I tried to .
So I alzai my face on the grid and I get my common to a vacuum of the room .
And I said , " Senenses , what , you 're both going to be brilliant , what if this book is not going to be a brilliant , not going to be a brilliant , "
Because as I see it , I 'm putting all of that I have , I don 't have this .
So if you want to be better , you have to present you and do your part .
OK . But if you don 't do it , you know what , I don 't do anything .
I 'm going to writing the same because it 's my work .
And I want to favor that was recorded that I 'm presented to do my part of the thing , because -- finally , OK -- I 'm going to be in the desert of the North Africa of the North Sunch , and the music and the music , and the music that went on and forth .
And they were always magnifies , because the ballerins were professionals and they were fantastic .
But every time , it was something happened , and one of these artists had become actually transclearly .
And I know what you know about , because I know that you all see , at some point , a performance .
It was as if the time you stop , and the ballerine walked through a kind of baller-short , and it was not doing anything about the solid , as 1,000 , but everything was going to .
And at the improvious not as a human human human human .
But it 's going to get into the fire of divinity .
And when this happened , you know , the people knew what was , they were called it .
They were in the hands and they started to dotar , " Allah , Allah , God , God , God , " God , God , God , "
That 's God , you know .
And it was a historic note -- when the More invaser the soouth of Spaiges , I was this abitude with them and the pronunded in the seual seful , " Alah , " The Ole , the , the gun , the ones , you can still hear in the corries or the flamk .
In Spaign , when a artist did something impossible and magic , " Allah , " Allah , " By , " incomprensible , " incomprensible , it 's a last -- a last thing of God .
And it 's great because we need .
But , the problem is the day after , for the ballerself , when you hear and discover that they 're 11 11 in the morning of Martedday and the last thing that is 11 in the morning , and the last thing .
It 's just a mortal mortal ginock , and maybe it 's not to make it more to make it up to that altel .
And perhaps no one will the name of God still as a lot of God , and what does it have to do with the rest of his life ?
It 's hard .
This is one of the most paintings to do in a creative life .
But perhaps it doesn 't have to be so angoal if you can 't believe , and you know , and more extraordinary expect of your being from you .
But you know , you know , they 're in prestired from a inimaginable source of this team of your life that you have to go out to somebody else else when you finished .
And , you know , if we think about this all changes .
And so I started thinking about , and it 's sure that I thought for different months in the work of the book that I 'm going to be in the early , the dangerous , spent , the dangerous , I followed up of my big success .
And what I have to continue to me when I feel electritried by this is , it 's not not fear .
It 's not just about your work .
Continua presentation of your part , any can be .
If your work is ballar , you know .
If the divine , and it assurgeon , and it 's just just to leave some kind of wonderful , for one moment , for one moment , you know , then , " Ole ! "
And you get your dance .
And " Ole ! " You know , you know , you know ,
I think I have to teach it .
" Ole ! " You know , it 's just for human human human , and testing topopes to make you a lot of deal .
Thank you .
Thank you .
June Cohen : Ole !
As I 've been talking about some of these projects on the genome of human genome , what can mean and discovery of new genes .
Now we 're starting a new path : We started to digital biology and now to digital biology and now now we 're both both in a new biology , and we 're going to be in a new biology , and I mean , and I 'm going to be able to digital .
We always tried to ask for a big questions .
What is life ? "
We tried different approximate , we reduced to the minimate .
We 're digitizating from almost 20 years .
When we sequenced the human genome was treated to go from the analogical genome of the biology of the digital biology of the computer .
Now , let 's do we , and we can regenerate life from this digital universe ?
This is the map of a little organism , Mycoplasma genitalium , which is the species from the genome of the genome of a little organism between those who can authorem in the lab .
And we tried to reduce the genome for creating genome to create one more little bit .
We can electric to be able to electric centinaum of about 500 .
But when we look at a metabolic map , it 's relatively simple than our .
And I think , this is simple .
But when we look at all the genes that we can elected , one at the time , it 's very unlikable that can bring a living cells .
So we decided that the only way to progrew was to be synthize this chromosoma in a way to be able to provide some of these fundamental questions .
And so we started the adventure of the Can we can be synthize a chromosoma ? "
Can it conhear the chemical conhear of produce these big molecules that we never can create before ?
And , in case , we can make a cross a chromosoma ?
A chromosoma is just a piece of chemical material .
The speed we are able to digitalize life is growing to the exponential life is growing to the exponential .
Our capacity to write the genetic code , instead , by procret , but it 's better .
And our most recent results the results on a curve .
We 've been more about 15 years ago .
The process of a lot of spaces , starting with a biothetic revision before we start the experiments .
But we found that synthesize DNA is very difficult .
There are a few thousand machines in the world that produce little segments of DNA , in the long long , of a 330 to 50 letters and it 's a degenerative process : the most of the most mistakes are .
So we had to develop a new new metod to assemble these framments and correcrecreceive the mistakes .
And this was our first tentative , to start from digital information of the digital genome of the genome of the genome of the genome of the genome of the genome of the genome of the genome of the genome of the genome of the genome of the genome , to start from the digital
It 's a little virus that kills bacteria .
We designed the framework of the mistaining of mistakes and get a molecule of DNA from about 5,000 lecking .
The interesting part is when we took this piece of chemical material chemical material , and we put it in bacteria , bacteria , and we put it in the bacterial particles .
The viral particles have then been require by cells , they 're back and then they 're back and they destructed the E.
I talked about recent recently with a oil industry , and it 's about their own own , which they have certainly understood that they have certainly understanding that model .
They have more than you .
We think that 's a situation where the software can actually build his same hardware in a biologist system .
But we wanted to do things in big .
We wanted to build the entire chromosoma .
They 're over 580 mile of genetic code .
So we thought about building it in the size of virus , we can change the virus , so we can change the cast of the virus , and it 's about a living cells .
The design is crucial , and if we start with digital information in a computer , these have to be very accurate .
When we sequenced this genome for the first time in 1995 , the accurate accurate was of a mistake for every 10 miles .
We found out , it 's about 30 mistake . If we had that original sequence never been able to do that .
One part of the process is designing 50 lauthors that are underlying with all of the other segments of 50 letters to build sounity and small little bit of working together .
We make a single elements here .
You should be brought you to be a lot of the big filiges .
Think of this : We have a genetic code on four letters : A , C , Gs and T.
Three of those letters together , they put up with about 20 advanced , and there 's a specific order to read every frighght-to-minacier .
So we can use the genetic code to write words , frases , thinking .
What we did at the beginning was self-self-self-self-reward .
Some of the fact that it wasn 't a poetry .
We designed these segments for potherly pointing them .
There are some of them , and they put them up and put them on them .
And we started assemble of parts , starting with segments from five to seven to seven mile the letters , and then you can make segments in a way to make a lot of 24 , and they 're going to get 72 .
And we 've been doing these segments in abundance so that we 're trying to build a very very very very robustoke -- as you can see in a minute .
We 're trying to self-self-remarkable to automatives .
So , this seems the tabellon a basket of a basket .
When we get these very long , much more than 100 miles , more than 100 miles , they will not grow up in E.
It comes to the limits of modern biology .
So we 've been considered other mechanisms .
We knew about another mechanism called recombination omologa , which in biology , and in biology , and in biology to repect DNA to repect the segments .
Here 's an example .
This organism , called Deinococraces , can assorry three million radiation .
You can see in the square of the soma is destructed .
In 12 -- 24 hours , it 's riassemble as it was before .
There are thousands of organisms that are able to do it .
These organisms can sit completely .
They can live under vacuum .
I 'm absolutely that life exists in space , and you know , places to find new environments of water .
And the NASA showed that this is .
This is a picture of molecule that we 've built using these processes , simply using the lights with design of appropriate design , to insert .
The lights assemble them .
This picture wasn 't been screen with a microscope , but with a microscope .
It 's a molecule , so that we can see the with a little bit of a law microscope .
These are pictures that are doing a period of six seconds .
This is the adversus we 've done a little time ago .
They 're over 580,000 letters of genetic code .
It 's the biggest molecule of a defined structure that we 've been from a man .
It has a molecular molecular weight million .
If you 're going to stick a 10 without spaces , you want to go to 142 pages only to transcause this genetic code .
Now , how do we work ?
Of course , a virus is a game from kids .
It 's a little bit more complicated when you use of bacteria .
It 's simply when it 's about eucariote as our : you can simply be the nuclear and inseries of it , and I 'm basically a process of cloning .
In the bacteria , the bacteria is instead in the cells , but we recently demonstrated that we 're able to do a complete complete trailer from one cell to another and to activity .
We can get a crum a crum from a microbial species .
The two are different as men from the topes .
We have added some gene in the way to decide which I can decide that to this chromosoma .
The then I 'm skied with the enables in a way to kill all the proteins .
And when we put it in the cells was study -- and you 'll appreciate our graphic graphic , you know , we 've got to the cell .
And we were thinking that we couldn 't go beyond , but we tried to spingerves us over there .
This is one of the major mechanisms of evolution .
We found that many species have added a second or a third chromosoma from some of the way , add in a thousand new tracks in that species .
So who think about evolution as a only gene and the time you have to be a gene and it doesn 't understand a lot of part of biology .
They 're in the enms called " enjome , it 's a restription that I 'm going to be digit .
The chromosoma that was in the cells , it was in the cells .
The cellpha-the cell phone that we put up up to a hour .
You know , it 's expressed , and it recognized the other crusted material as an exranef material , and we 've been reded with only the cells and the new chromosoma .
It became blue because of the genes we 've insered .
And in a short leve lead of time , all the characteristics of a species are going to lose , and you turned out in a new species , based on the new software that we 've insered in the cell .
All the proins of the proins , the members have changed , and when we read the genetic code , exactly what we 're going to have transfit .
Now , this may seem altering altering software , but altering the DNA software , we can change things in manipulation .
Now , I 've already explain that there 's not talking about genesis -- but of progress to three million years and a half million evolution of evolution , and I said that maybe we 're going to create a new version of Cambrian exhihilosion of Cambrian exhihilobe .
Why do that ?
I think it 's enough obvious when we think about our necessity .
We 're going to go from six billion and a half billion people in the next 40 years .
Right for an example : I was born in 1946 .
Now , there are three people on the planet for each existent in 1946 . I 'm going to be four .
We are having problems now to find food , water and pull , and it 's a lot of food and well-to-half billion and a half billion people .
It 's going to be more than doing it for nine billion .
We 're using more than five billion carbon , more than 30 billion carbon , more than 30 billion baries .
That means a million baries a day .
When I try to find biological processes , or any kind of process to reach them , it will be a huge challenge .
And we have to keep the whole of the CO2 of these materials that goes into the atmosphere .
At day , because the scientific discoveries in the world , we have a database with about 20 million genes , and I like to think that are the components of the future .
The electronic industry , it just just a dozen of about components , and think about how many different things are out of them .
Our limits here are principles from the biologist and our imagination .
Now we have the techniques , because of these rapid metods synthetization , in order to create what we call genomics .
We can build a big robot that can produce a big robot that can produce a million crusted a day .
Think of these 20 million genes of these 20 million genes or to get to get the processes to make eight or drugs , new vaccines , and we can change , and we can change , thank you very much more biology , now that in the last 20 years of science .
And it 's just a standard selection .
We can choose for possibilities of survival , chemical production or carbons , production , or fuel , production of vaccines .
This is an instantly of some software programmed that we 're working for being able to several and design species .
Well , we don 't know how they 're going to be .
We know exactly how genetic code .
Now we 're just focus on the carbons of generation .
You 've seen it out of you who extract from gram a willing experiment .
We have carbons of second and third generation that will be enough to use enough to the slead on the highest of the highest , as the either or different different than the butanol .
But the only way the biology can have a big impact without increasing more than food , and the cost of food and limit , the contailability to be the CO2 in matters , before we 're working on the cell that can reach this thing , and we think that we can get the first carbons of the minus of the past .
The solar light solar with CO2 is a metodo-- but in our discovered in the world , we found different metods .
This is a organism we 've described in 1996 .
It 's going to be in the deep ocean , at about 2500 feet of the temperature of the water .
They create meters from CO2 molecular hydrogen molecular as energy .
We 're trying to understand if we can indoar the CO2 , which can easily be transformed to be transformed to tramed that .
So , we think we could be able to be able to increase what 's about to increase what 's life is , " which is " We , " is " We , we have the goal of the goal of the oil industry .
Exactly . If you don 't do it from TED , where you can ?
It would be a main of energy .
And we 're working on the same metods to create vaccines instantly .
You 've seen this year with influence , we always go back to a year and a dollar in less when it comes to find the waccine .
I think that you can change building a combinable vaccines in a little bit .
So , the future could start to look at it , now , the tree of evolution , and the tree of evolution , and infinally , the tree of the eucariote , and infinally cell the eilariote .
We are so much from improve people .
Our discovered is to do it in a way of living enough to try to make it . Thank you very much .
First of all I 'll show you , the most quickly possible , some of the fundamental technology we 've brought to a quick as a year ago , it 's a year ago . This is Seadragon .
It 's a environment where you can interact is to local level that remotion with a huge amount of data data .
So here we 're seeing a lot of gabyte of digital with a sort of a kind of a kind of a kind of panoramic panorthrooms , available to be like we want .
And it 's not as much as much as much as much as much of information we see , how big these things are these things of data or the images of data or the images .
Most are common photographs , but this for example is a profound scansion of the Bioteca prostate of the Congress , and reenter in the gams of 300 megathered .
It doesn 't make any difference because the only thing that limit of a system like this is the number of pixel on your screen in any time . It 's also an architecture . It 's also a very fflexible architecture .
This is a book , for example of data not images .
This is Casa desolated capable . Every colonna represented a caple .
So , I 'm going to show you that 's just about the text of these things , to make a kind of , to see that that 's a real representation of the text , not a picture .
It could be a little artificial way to read a electronic book .
I don 't think it 's a advice .
This is an example of the most realistic . It 's about a number of of the Look .
Every picture is the beginning of a sex---site .
And it really gives you the please of the experience of reading the paper version of a quoties of a quotidian or of a quotidian , which is for nature of a lot of a half .
We also did something with the angle of this particular number of the Last of the Look .
We have created a bunch of the alta solution-solutionary -- much more than that you use in a normal adversisit -- and we inserted in the content .
If you want to see the carry of this car caractive , you can see here .
Or other models , or even the specific techniques .
And that really demonstrate some of these ideas to eliminate the limits of space on the screen .
I hope that that means you put up the pop-up , and to other porcheries , and more similar , not to be necessary .
Of course , the map is one of the most obvious applications for this kind of technology .
And I don 't want to lose time , if we don 't know that we have contributes to give them in this field .
These are all the street in the U.S. subvrapped an image of NASA .
So now we go through something else .
So , this is actually from the vial on the web ; you can go to see it .
It 's a project called Photosynthy , which combine two different technologies .
One is Seadragon and the other is a visual research at a very interesting computer at a very interesting computer for Noah Snavely , a student of the University of the University of UW and Rick Seitz of Microsoft Rick Szeliski of Microsoft Rick . " A option . "
And it 's from the vial on the web , I managon Seadragon .
You can see it when we do this kind of screen , where we can go from one image to another and have this kind of experience to solution .
But the space collocation of the images here has actually a meaningful .
The algorithms of visualization , we 've been recorded these pictures together , so that they 're going to places in the reverse of the world , and I imagine -- all of the swalk on Montagne Roccious dowwites -- they 're screen . Here you see the elements of a slightly . And these things are all of a slide , and these things are all of a slide .
I don 't know if I have time to show you some other environment .
There are some more space .
I want to go directly to one of the original data of Noaah-- and this is from a precedent prototypes of Photosynth-time time time time time , I 'll be the first time , I 'll show you what I think is really the key to be the key to be really the key key to the environments that we put into the website .
We had to worry about the legal aspects and on the way .
This is a reconstruction of the cattedral of Nots of the images of Flickr . Bastic digital Noth Dame in Flickr and you get pictures of these ankr , and on the other of the campus , and on the other of the campus , and it 's discovered a picture that it is discovered .
So they are all pictures of Flickr and they were all connected to the level in this way .
And it 's possible to be able to be simply simply .
You know , I would never have thought to end to work for Microsoft .
It 's very gratifiying this kind of account here .
I think you can see that it 's about a lot of different types of focus : from those of the cellphones of those cell phones of SLR , a number of meaningful , put together in this environment .
And if I can , I try to try to those more strange .
There are a lot of things , etc .
So , a few part of this is a series of photographs -- it .
This is a poster of Noth Dame registrated .
We can go from the poster to the physics of this environment .
The essential point is that we can do things with social environment . This is now is taking data from the whole memory of the social environment . This is a collective , from visual point of view -- and to visual view of view -- and to all those data together .
All those pictures become connected together , more than the parts of the parts .
You have a model of the land of the entire land .
Think about this as a prolunging of Stephen Lawler on Earth Earth 's Earth .
It 's something that grows in complexity , as people use it , and the advantages for people to use it .
Their pictures are marcated with metaders from other people .
If you get some of the idea of contrassigning all these things , and I 'm going to be the name , my pictures of a cattedral of Noth Dame improvised , and I can use how to be a point of inresult to immerges in that metaps , and then you have a kind of a cross-momodly , and you have a kind of cross-momothern .
Of course , a consequence of everything is that are virtual models of extraordinary models of each part of the land , it 's interesting , you know , and you know , and similmilar images , and similmilar images .
Milles thank you .
Chris Anderson : I realized what your software is that your software is that you can do is that at some point , in the next years , all photographs , all photographs are going to be practically connected together ?
BAA : Yes . What 's doing is doing it .
It 's creating of hyperlink , if you want , between images .
And it 's doing it in the bottom of images .
The thing becomes very interesting if you think about the richness of information several information that many of these images are possible .
As when you do a research of images on the web , you digit a frase and the text on the web page of the picture .
Now , what happens if that picture is that picture you all your pictures ?
So the amount of interconnection , semantic and the amount of riches that is really huge . It 's a classic classic effect of the network .
CA : Blaise , it 's really amazing . Compliments .
BAA : I 'm going to give you very much .
One of the major of the major of the dollar of the etnographic research is that we can live between who has no mented the antial traditions , between who has been in the wind , you know , you know , the past the wind , you 're going to the wind the plants of the plants , and the focus in the wind and the plants .
Basti thinking about the monks , Jaguar vide , and the Vy Lattea , or that the monitites of the anthrounded , or that in Himalaya , or that in Himalaya , the buddddists still the respair of anthropology , and the idea that the world 's major , and the idea that the world 's not exist , but it 's just a model of reality , but it 's a model ,
the consequence of a particular set of choices that our adaptative choices that our stypes has done , well , or bad , many generations ago .
And , of course , we all share of the essential tracks .
We all profound out .
We are subjects to start .
We have to death the inexorability of deed , so we don 't surprise if we 're going to leave you .
We all have a art .
What 's the particular one of the song , the rhythm of the dance of each culture .
It 's not about the people who are the Penan inforests of the Borneo , or the follow of the Vodoor of the Sahara Kaisut Kaisut Kaisut Kenya , or a Sahara , or a camp in the Sahara .
He was my complished the desert of a month ago , or a month ago , or a hell , or a bunch of a month , the Everest , the Actually , the Actured of the world .
All of these people teaches us are other ways of exists , other ways of exists , other ways of thinking about other ways of them in the world .
And if you get a moment , you know , it 's a concept that can give you hope .
And then , the myriads of cultures of the world creating a life of spiritual and cultural cultural and cultural , which is important for the planet , and it 's important for the well-being of the planet as a biosy-to-being like , biosphere .
And you can think about this cultural ragnosphere , and you can call the etnosphere , and you can call the exhic exhibition of all concepts , inspirations , intuitions , inspirations , intuitions , intuitions , intuitions ,
The etnosphere is the fantastic pathrimonium of humanity .
It 's the symbol of what we are and what we can be in how much inquisy .
And because it was a biophoophooophy has been very quickly , and it 's going to be much more quickly .
Nowner , for example , would be that 50 percent of all species was or it was on the orgle of the exintion simply because it 's flepocalm , and it 's more apocalitten -- in the field of diversity -- and it 's not near the optimistic diversity -- that 's the cultural diversity .
And the indict of that is , of course , the language .
When you were born .
One language is not just a vocabolary or from a bunch or a series of rules .
So , a language is the spring of human spirit .
It 's the half the way the animum of every culture comes in the world .
Every language is a forest of mind , a backkkin , a thought , a thought of the inspiritual .
And of those 6,000 language , as we are here to Monterey , at least the metal of us is not more sounsurrounded in the ears of the children .
They 're not teaching kids , the people who who means , at least that you don 't know something , that they 're already death .
What is there more tried to be that you 're going to be from the silence , of the last to talk about a language , of the last language , of the last to be the wisdom of the children ?
This is a few of some of the world in some of the world of the two weeks : every two weeks , each two weeks , and a door and door with a ancient language .
And I know somebody of you say , " isn 't it better ?
The world would not be a better place if you talk about all the same language ? "
I 'm going to talk kogi .
You 're going to be a tract thing that means not to talk about your language .
I 'd like to do a journey through the etnosphere --
a little journey in the etnotion to give you a source of what we are lose .
A lot of us are deal that when I say , " different ways of exists , " I mean , very different ways of exists .
We make this bimber Barasana , AAAAAAizy , the popular popular of anaconda , which crede at the myth of the latest of the latest in the sleatest of the latest s-to-to-herself .
It 's a popular popular that 's not able to distinguess color from the green because the time you 're identified in the forest time of the forest , which depends on the popular .
They have a strange language and a matrimonial , detect examia , " examia language , " : " You have to save a different language .
And all of the roots in the mythologist , but it 's particularity is that in these families and extent is that in these families are seven language of matrimons .
They just just listen to listen to you and then start talking about .
We take one of the most interests of the most interests I lived , the Waorans of Ecuador , a popular popular popular people who had the prims of the prims of the 1958 .
In 1957 five missionary , they 've been a construct construct a crug .
They did that that from the top photographes , they were reraft , they were on , and they were on , and mented that that this population of the pluvial forest .
They collected the picture from the Earth , they 're going to be a shape or a shape , or a shape , and they 're not going to be there , and they 're killed the five five missionary .
But the Waorans don 't kill the straired .
They killed them between .
54 percent of the mortality was caused by their same .
We were eight generations and we found two of natural morning and when we 've been talking about to know , they 've been assupply , they had a lot of them , and then they were invective , and then they were invecking , and then they had a very incredible knowledge of the forest .
The crugs were able to recognize the animal , from 40 steps and recognizes the species .
In the first 1980s , I 've been assigned a very interesting task when my professor of Harvard , I was going to Haiti to go to Haiti to the society of the power of the potence of Duvalier and the Tonton Macoutes , and I imposition to be about the way to do the arm of the Warvalier and the Tonton M.
For a sense of a myraologist , I would have to understand the culture Vodoor , and the Vodoor is not magnine .
It 's quite a complex vision of a vision .
Very interesting .
If you ask me to say , the big religions of the world , what would you ?
Cristianesimum , Islam , Buddism , Ebraism , etc .
A continent is always left out , and I think the sub-Saharan not has any of religious . And instead of it 's always a lot of people . And instead of these concepts are very profound out of religious religious religious ,
What makes it interesting is the voodoor is the intended between life and death .
So , they 're going to be hired the spirites .
The spirites can be invoced by the Grande Acqua , they response to the rhythm of the dance and they replace for a short way that for a short , and they 're going to be the following .
So , the voodooodoers like , " You know , you 're going to talk about God .
We say , " We say , " We 're going to say , "
And from the moment you are , it 's the spirit that you , as you can you like bad ?
So you have incredible events : following the voodoor in state of trance that touches are touched by infur , infur , infur , in the body of the mind when it 's catalized in a state of exrema excited .
And all the people who I lived the most extraordinary I lived the most extraordinary of the Sierra Nevada 's Marta Marta , in the Santa Marta Marta Marta ,
It was a lot of the ancient civilization that once once they were living on the caraibia , the popular of the Colombia , the popular is the popular massive massive massive sesses that you were on the wild plant to the plant to the carry on the plant .
In a drude of blood , this popular , this popular has never been conquisted by the drugs .
And they 're also also also , by a clero , but their formation is really extraordinary .
The young people following up from families to three or four years , and they live secreating in a world of good good , and they live in a good time , and they live in a good time .
Two periods of noves years of the way to reproduce the noves months of the agement of the mother , they 're going to be metaphor , now are metaphor in the uter of the Grande Mad Mad .
And so , that time , they 're acculated to the values of the society , values that they predict their pay and only the cost of the conscious equilibrium -- or to say the wealth -- or to say the balance of their society ,
And the term of this initiation , they 're improvised out and for the first time in their life , at 18 years , to see a high age of 18 years , they see a high high school . And in that account of the first blood of beautiful landscape , all that they learn in the theory is that it 's a little bit of a splendor . The pret is a passion of it . The pret is a passion of a passion , and it does a passion , and it goes back and it back and the first time in the first time in the time .
" I said , " Where ? Proprise as I said .
It 's study . Now it 's a bit of you . "
They call it major fraters and they say that we , the tiny colors of destruction .
This level of intuition is extremely important .
When we think about indications and the environment and the older of the old populations and the old story of the wildness of willing , which is a concept of the simplicity of the simplicity or magic ic ic ic Thoreau and we say that these people are closer to the Earth .
The popular of Ingenes are not feeled by the nine of the nostaly nostaly .
There 's no space for these things in the palulial of Are , or the gelids of Tibet , but thank you to reach , but that 's a mystics of Earth 's Earth 's Earth 's neighborhood , but on a whole thing , but on a very closer , but on a very much more sotle , but on a lot of human conscious .
What does that mean ?
And it 's a girl of the Ande that growing the mountain is a spirit of the mountain is a spirit of Apu who will be a different human being being being being being being deeply different , and it will have a different human being being being a little bit different mountain with the mountain , and it 's a mountain .
That 's the dimora of a spirit or a mineral is irrelevant .
What 's interesting is the metaphor that defines the relationship between the individual and the natural world .
I grew up in the forests of Columbia Britannica creating that forests to be cut .
And this is a human being different from my friends Kwautl that they believe that the forests are demnow of Hukuk and the band the band the band the band the blood of the world , and the wild the world , the spirites that are going to be in the inspirites that they 're going to the Hamatsa .
If you start to look at these cultures can create different reality , you can start to understand some sensational feelings .
I went to this picture at the aprile in Amazon the nordocccies .
Maybe some of you 've heard about the ayahuash , the most powerful psycoactive psycoactive .
What makes it fascinating the ayahuash is not the potential potential of the substance of the substance , but his elaboration . It 's composition . It 's composal .
So , a law , this lian law that 's a series of carboline , harm and harmful , harmful and harmful , and harmful .
Treen the only plants of a bluster that altera little bit of the consciousness , but it 's choice with a little bit of a family of coffee , Psychotridis called Psychotridis .
This is a plant could be triped , very similar to serotonine , dimethoonine to the serotonin , dimethoxydimethoxtamine .
If you ever see Yanomami , you 'll see the case that they do from a different set of species , anoxily contail , and it 's contail .
And so I 'm going to get that or the hidden is a little like to be parked by a carry of a pink of a pink of a wild electricity . [ Risate ] not creates a distorsion of reality ; it 's actually .
I was often a lot of my professor , Richard Evan Shultes , the man who was psychchcharen , with his discovery of the lost fungi , and it was psychchard , in Mexico .
And I think , I can 't have to classifire these tripamin as well , because if you 're not done by a hallucinated .
It 's possible to be just if you get the assume with other subsisides that you can see MAr MAO .
Now , it 's the beautiful : the carboline that are in this lian aren are initial of MAO , the same kind of necessary to potential for potential to potential the triptic . The question of spontaneous , how are these people are in a flap , like these people are people to find out of these people who are in this way , creating a version , but if you combine you get a version of the background .
We use the great eulifemism of the prove and the mistake , which can reveil .
But if we ask the Indians , they 'll tell us " The piant talk about it . "
What does that mean ?
This tribes , the Cofan , it has 17 variety of ayahuash , which are neply nice in the forest , and we would be in the same species .
If you ask them how to stbilize their tassonomy , they 'll tell us , " I thought I was about the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest .
The solution is : they take the 17 variety of a lone , and each one will a little piena and each one will a different .
So , you know , you know , in Harvard , but it 's much more interesting that you can count the stami .
Now , [ applaushers the problem is that the ones of us who have to heart heart people are pittoresks , but in some way , but in some way of our real world , and they 're going to be beyond of our real world , and pass over over over .
In fact , the X-century , between 300 years , it 's not going to be remembered for the or innovations , but rather as it was where we were stop and unfortunately , or it 's going to accept the initiation of mass of diversity and cultural mass of diversity and cultural mass of diversity and cultural mass of diversity and cultural diversity . Now , it 's not change .
All cultures through the seuble of new life .
And the problem is not the technology .
Indians are Sioux to be Sioux when they put it from the arc and they 're doing it and freceived as a part of Americans , when they put it out of the caving and the calm .
It 's not the change or technology that 's integrity or technology , it 's the power of the etnosphere . It 's the power .
The fly fly of the domination .
And if you give a look at the world , you 'll find that these are not cultures destinated in the world , you know ,
They 're living and dynamics are creatures out of existence from existence of hyththetic hyfables that are beyond .
I know , I 'm a tracks in the painting of the Penan Think --
a popular notion of Sarawak , in the summary of the airplanes , a popular that has librought to a generation , and now reduced to a generation , and now reduced to the reward to the reward of the fiume , where you can see the fiume , where the sorts of the light-Mar Cinese Meridional Meridional Meridional , where the sites of the Meridian , and the horizon , and they 're going to be the gar to be re-down to be , and to be the horizon , and the sendendendendending the sended , a a a a a a a a a a a a swear ,
I 'm going to take the stand with the drew of the subtation .
Or , in the case of Yanomami , are the disease that I came with the discovery of the gold .
If we move on the mountain of Tibet , where I 'm doing a lot of research , you 'll see the last last last few minutes .
As you know the genocide , the physics of a popular popular , is construction of a popular popular , but the destruction of life , not just is a popular popular , not just a popular . But it 's a popular , but it 's a popular .
And you can 't understand the suffering of Tibet until it 's part of the beginning .
I 've been very 6,000 miles from Chengdu in China through Tibet , through Tibet , and it 's coming in in Lhasa with a young young , but only came to Lhasa young , but only came to Lhasa , and I realized what we hear about .
6,000 monuments in the dust and cenried .
1.2 million people killed by military , the Cultural Rifly .
The father of this guy was ascritical at the Panchen Lama .
which means that it was killed to the temple of the Chinese invasion .
I 'm worst with Santity in Santity in the diaspora that has brought the popular in Nepal .
Scim was impried and his coled was recil .
It was brought to the age of two years , hidden by two years , hidden , because it couldn 't have to live without him .
The sister , which has done the same , it was mitted in refuel .
A day he was a day , I 'm going to calculated a RResesist , for this transgression , it was mitted to the several years .
Tibet can be inspirit , but it can be inspirit , but the recenter of the popular .
And finally , it 's a choice .
We want to live in the world world monoowned , or we want to account the world policy or the world 's policy or the world ?
The big anthropologists Margaret Mead , before he said that his bigger was that , in our big paper was that , in our own own a very much labor of human reduced , and we 're not just going to see the gamorer of human reduced , but a day we 're going to be a very strictly to be .
And it 's umillion people remember that our species is exist for 60,000 years .
The Riflights , which has given us the agriculture , which has done us us to fight the cult of seed seed , by the poetry of the slegs of the clero , creating the rowing of the clero , creating the crugs of specialization , and we talk about 10,000 years ago .
The modern world indualized has been 300 years .
That 's a story that we don 't suggested that we have to all the challenges that we have to deal in the millennia to come .
When these myriads of cultures of the world is asked what to say to be human , they respond with 10,000 different voices .
And it 's in these risks that we all risk the chance of being what we are : a kind of a conscious species , which has to make all the people and the yard , and the gives can fiorth . And there are big moments of optimism .
I went to the picture on the end of the North island of Baffin , when I went to the whenever of the whales of Inuit , and this man , Olaya , and this man , Olaya , he was told me the wonderful story of his grandfail .
The downn-un-wouldn 't be a fall with the Inuit and in the ' 50s to stbilies our , we 've required them in colonies .
The grandfail of this man refiuted .
The family , themating her life , she took them all the time , and all his attackers .
You have to know that Inuit doesn 't temon the freest , they can use it .
The pattins of slitte in the origin were made of fishing skin pin the paper .
The grandfather of this man didn 't do it intimistic or from the library or from the library , which was suffering .
It 's sgattaiolded , you 've been calated the pantalone in the foods of photoes and defecated in your hand . When I did it , you know , it 's working on a lama .
It 's spring on the points of this coltellim , and when I became solid , and when I became solid , she was killed a dog .
It has been a guns , and created a brillier , with the cases of actic , he imbrillied another dog and it 's been disappeared on the bank , collecting on the bull , you know , the tellikkk-up .
We want to talk about cavarsely with nothing ? [ Risate ] . And this , in different ways , [ Applausi is the symble of the resilience of the popular Inuit and the population of the world of the world .
In the 1999 , 1999 , the downn-government redied , the total control of an area of territory , the most of California and Texas a lot of California and Texas a together .
It 's the new paria . It 's called Nunavut .
It 's a independent territory . They all source the mineraries .
One of the splendied , as a natione-state could recognize with his popular .
And , to finish , I think it 's quite obvious at least at the time of us was in these remote of the planet , and realized that they don 't have to remote .
For somebody is home .
They represent the human imagination that risk up to the other time . And for us , and for all of these children , and all of these kids , and they become part of our children , and they become part of the geography of hope .
And finally , we 're in a lot of National Geographic , we 'll never get anything .
We think the polemies --
[ Applausi are not persuasive , but we think that stories can change the world , and maybe we think the best institution to tell stories of the world . Every month of our website . Every month of our website .
156 countries transmit our television .
We have to be lette from millions of people .
Our work is to travel in the etnosphere to bring our audience in places of wonderful cultural places that they 're going to be brought by how they 've been and , it 's going to be , and they 'll be able to be a central reveal . The world 's the world of anthropology , and we have to find a style in a pluralist and we have to find a pluralist of life and cultural world , and we have to find a living in a world of life in the world , and we have to be able to get the aught our aught our own own own own own own own in a
where the saggeels of all people can contribute to our well-being collective .
Thank you .
I 'm going to talk about some things that I wrote in this book that I hope you 've heard and proverse to proverse some of the connections , in the case , you 're not boring them .
I want to start with what I call the " dogma "
The dogma official thing ?
The dogma official of all the Western industry , the West 's dogma , the official of our citizens , " If we want to massive to do it is like to do it is like to do to do it is like to be similar freedom . "
The reason is , from a side , in fact that freedom is in the same value , is pretious , it 's pretively , essential for human beings .
And the other is that if we are libers , each of us can act for all of us can act for all that massive , and you can do everything that massive our .
The way to massive freedom is massive to the choice .
The people are more librought , more libate , and more more more , and more more more , and more more .
So , this is so deeply deeply drubbed in society that no one would be to put it in the society that no one would put it in the society .
And it 's also deeply roaded in our lives .
I 'm going to show you some examples of what progress has done as possible .
This is my supermarket . It 's particularly big .
I lose a simple note on the condition on injeckle .
In my supermarket , there are 175 condition , no contain 10 variety of the extrade of the extrade , and 12 aceti .
Here 's the supermarket .
Then you go to the store of electronic electronic to buy a stereo : casse , the CD , radio , radio , the left-hand , the left-hand .
And in this single one of electronic electronic , there 's a big number of audio components .
We can make six million and a half million different combinations using the components that there are only in a store .
You have to admit that there is a lot of choice .
And the world of communications : the world of communications .
And once I was a child , you could get all the services , and they could get all the services of willing , to pat the pat the mom Bell .
It was a phone , you didn 't get it .
One of that , the other thing , it was that the telephones didn 't break .
These days are gone .
We have a variety of telephones , especially between the cellphones .
Here 's the cell phones of the future .
My favorite is that in the middle , MP3 , cut out of the hidden , and forced up for the brull .
If you don 't have any seen in the nearly house , you 're going to be able to be .
And what happens is that the end is that people entra in the negots and ago , this question . And you know what is the answer is ? The answer is " No . "
It 's not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn 't make things .
So , in other aspects of life that are much more important than the acquilies of the acquiably exhihibition of choices .
Axxistence : it 's not going on in the United States that you go from the doctor and the doctor you have to do .
Instead , you know , the doctor , and the doctor says , " OK , we could do . "
You know , " Does , what would I do ? "
And the doctor says , " A has these benefits and these sleepts , and B has these benefits and these sent . "
" What do you want to do ? "
And you rebats , " Doo if you were , what would you do ? "
And the doctor : " But I 'm not . "
The result of the authonomy of maled , " expression that does seem to look at a beautiful thing .
But it 's not that one to move the fish and responsibility of the responsibility of making decisions from somebody knowledge , and you know , the doctor , to qualize that it 's not -- and so not in the ideal condition to make the patient decisions .
There 's a huge marketing of products , you know , people like me and you , and you know , if you think there 's no sense , because you think that we can 't buy them .
But if we can 't buy them , because they have public public icizes ?
The answer is that they want to be at the doctor to ask the doctor for us to change us .
So , what 's basically about our identity is our identity is a question of choice , as you see in this vigness , " We don 't want to forced children . They 're going to be the right right now , " We don 't need to be a moment .
And we can reinvented many times , we can make it .
That means that every morning , the risk , you have to decide that kind of person .
I 'm going to spect the family and matrimony , a time the common , which is common for anyone , it was that there was that there was the most as possible as possible , and it was to get the most price as possible .
The only versus it was with who , not when , and it 's not when you know what to do after .
And it 's really to play .
I 'm going to start very smart students , and I 'm 20 percent of the work than a time .
And it 's not because they 're not a brilliant because they 're not degree .
but why I 'm impensierites , I mean , " I should be there or no ? I should do it right now ? "
" Do you get me more later ? I have to think before I 'm going to get the career ? "
They 're interrogatives logiving .
And they try to answer these questions , even if this implying , and if this is not to be the complished and I don 't get a beautiful vote to my examples .
And they have to do it . I 'm important questions .
Now , the work : We are lucky , as Carl , because technology allows us to work every day , every day , every day , every day , from every day , and it 's about the Hotel Randolph .
I 'm talking about , there 's a angle , and I didn 't tell no one where the WiFi works .
I don 't tell you , because I want to use it .
What does that mean , this incredible freedom of choice we have about work ? It 's that we have to continue , and we have to work or not .
We can go to see our son , and the cell phone , with the cell phone in a cell , the Blackberry in the other , and the notebook , tively , and the notebook , and the ginock .
And even if I 'm all spent , every minute we see our son , and we 're also asking the participate , " I said , " I said , " I said , " I said , " I 'm going to answer this called ? "
" I said to answer this email ? I have to habboy this letter ? "
And when the answer is " no , " , all this makes the experience of the partner of your own son very different , from what would be in other conditions .
So , from any of the look at , things and big , and big , objects and life , life is a question of choice .
And once the world was this : Ovice , there were some possibilities , but not that issue of choice .
The world of today is a positive thing to this : The dilemma is , " It 's a positive thing , or negative ? "
The answer is South .
The positions of positions we know all , so I 'm going to talk about the negative .
All of this particular choice two effective , two effects of people .
The first , paradox , it 's that makes a paralysally , instead of liberation .
With many options between the things that choose , it becomes very difficult to do it .
I give you an example example : a study conduct on the plans of fly fly .
And a colleague had access to the data of Vander , the gigantic society of a source of a million clients .
What she found is that for every 10 solutions that are offered in the most , percentual percentage of adesion , the percentage of two percent .
With 50 fourth s-four-percent of adesions than you have been available to when they are available . Why ?
Because with 50 fourth fourth between the gave , it 's maledly difficult to decide , and choice is to be sent .
And to tomorrow , and I still asked the tomorrow , and of course , and of course , the tomorrow , and of course , I never get .
You know , it doesn 't mean that these work from old old , they will be food for dogs because they don 't have enough money , it 's so osticks , because they 're not so osticks that they will also lose the funny of work .
I 'm not talking about , they 're losing until five to five to year , and it would be a lot of work , which would be a deal to be .
So the paralysis a consequence of having too many choice .
And I think it makes the world .
" And to finish , " And I 'm going to end , ketchup , sens or maionth ? "
Would you take the right decision , if it 's for the etheternity , right ?
You don 't want to choose the wrong thing , and you know , the wrong condition of the wrong condition .
So this is the first effect . The second is that we can avoid the paralives and do a choice , at the end of how we were at least to be a lot of how we would be done with less options to be as we were to be with less options to be .
And that 's about different reasons .
One of these is that with many condition of the things that you would take , if you understand one and it 's not perfect , it 's easy to imagine that you could do a different choice that would be better . And what happens is that 's going on . And what happens is that the alternative , and it 's going to be better . And what happens is that the alternation of choice , and it 's just a requick , and it 's going to be a very much of the ravailable ,
And when it was a good decision .
And so you get there , more is easy to dislist any details that it 's insophister than any details .
And then , there 's what economists call expensive opportunity .
Dan Gilbert has closer very well , as the value of the value we do at things that we 're confronted .
And I know , when there are many options , it 's easy to represent the characteristics of the alternative alternative , and it 's less subsisible .
Here 's an example . I don 't know , I 'm not in New York .
But that 's what you would probably think .
There is this couple of Hamptons .
A place of lussides .
It 's very very spiach . Ot-day . It 's all about them .
Never , it 's not . But what he thinks is , " Well , the reason , the reason , it 's Agotten . "
" Everyone of my neighbor are on . "
" I could talk about it just to a house in front of home . "
And I 'm going to two weeks , I 'm going to go out -- every day -- every day -- the chance of parking where you want .
The expensive opportunity to deminate the subsisit for what we have , when the choice was a cell .
And the most of the options we have to look , more the characteristics of attractive .
Here 's another example .
This is a lot of things .
It 's about living time , and maybe a living lently .
But the most important point is that you choice , you go , you know , you know , you know , you know , it 's not to do other .
The things that we don 't get to attractive , they can make less attractive , what we do .
And third point : spiral growing of expectations .
I tried to my skin bought a new couple of jeans .
I 'm very willing jeans .
And once the jeans were of one , you know , and they were bought and besty , they were discovered , just after I was made them a life and work a lot of times , they started to go well .
So , I went to buy a couple of a couple of when the old old were going , and I said , " I need a couple of jeans , this is my cut . "
The commit , he said , " Look , you know , the relationship , and it 's rely ? "
Look , and you want to do with the bottles ? " Stonebottles ? "
" Look ? "
" Seieight them to hate ? Bble , the bla -- " Continuit to elentail .
I was sent , and after a little bit , I could say , " I want the guy that -- I want the one of the only guy , " I want to be a time I tried to all the time I tried to all the time I 'm going to get a few of the miles , I 'm going to be a few miles of the best jeans that I had ever .
It was the massive . I had the best .
But I feel worse .
Why ? I wrote a whole book for understanding it .
The reason I was worst is that I was worst that with all that choice was altime , the jeans had to be perfect .
I was at the beginning , I was expected to do anything about except that when there was just a kind of , but when I saw 100 different , accidents , at least a kind of of a little bit of a kind of of had to be perfect .
And what I was good , but not perfect .
After you have paragoned that I was insodded on what I was sent in confronted .
The add of options in life , it 's about to be expected to be expected to the expectations that are on the options of the options .
And this will be less subddisfation , when the results are good .
No one in the world of marketing , if it realized .
Because if they knew it , you would not know what I 'm talking about .
The truth is more than that .
" You know , it was worst , " The reason I was worst when it was worst , it was worst that when it was worst , it was still possible to meet of surprised .
And in the world we live in -- the world where we live -- opulents , industry , industry with expectancy , the massive , we can hope is that things are at the high expectations .
You never have surprised as your expectations , my expectations , my expectations , I 'm ingantic .
The secret of happiness -- that you 're here -- it 's : " By wawaiting . "
I mean , little biographic moment -- that I 'm really saved and my wife is really amazing .
I couldn 't do it better , I didn 't have to do it .
But it 's not always a good thing .
And finally , a consequence of the buy of a couple of jeans that 's just a jeans is that when you 're not a lot of things , and you know , " Why ? "
" Who is responsible ? "
The world is responsible . What could I do you ?
When you have hundred of kinds of jeans , and you understand a insoddisfacing , and you know , you know , it 's the responsible , it 's the key to responsible you .
You could do better .
With hundreds of variety of variety of variety of variety of variety of variety of variety of variety of variety of variety of variety of variety of variety of variety of variety of variety of variety of variety of variety of variety of variety of variety of variety of variety of vari
So when people take decisions , they also get decisions , they 're going to be insoddisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisappear .
In the last years , the depression is explose in the industry world .
I think a meant factor -- not the only , but important -- of this hond of depression is that people have experiences of being being in in a depression is that people have experiences are too high .
And when they have to explain this situation , they think the cold is .
So the final is that in general , we 're better , objectively , but we feel worse .
Let me remember you .
This is the official dogma , what we all take for good and it 's completely fast . It 's not true .
There 's no doubt that a little bit of choice is better than I don 't have to do it , but it 's not to be a little bit of choice is better than a little bit .
There 's a critical value . I don 't know what it 's .
But I 'm sure we have been a piece of a piece of the level where the best choice to our life .
Now , from the political point -- I 'm almost finite -- from the point of politician , the nocction is the follow .
What it allows all this choice in the industry is the material wealth .
There are many places in the world , and you know , you know , where the problem is not that they have any of them .
The problem is that they have too long .
So the cenda I 'm talking about is a males of modern modern , rich society , rich society , rich society .
And what does to depress and arrheaves is this : Steve Levitt Levitt , and it 's about how those expensive and discovered in bike .
I mean that these choice , complicated and available , it 's not that they 're just inutiseful .
I 'm a dollar dollar .
They 're worse .
If a little bit of what in our society is allows to be reversated in those where people has too much much more points , it would not only be their life to improve , but also our own life .
This is what economists call a very paretian improve improve .
A redistribution of the income re-up , not only to the poor -- because of this choice in except that you go .
So I 'm going to end , " You can be all you want to be . "
You , you think , you think , " But what does that fish ? "
" It 's obvious that you can 't make any of a glass of glass . "
" A remarkable vision , a limited vision of the world --
and I 've got the interpret , at the beginning .
But then , I think , instead , instead , I realized that that fish knows the long .
Because the reality is that if you 're in frantum the bock , so that , " everything is possible , " you can 't get the freedom .
If you get the bock into the way that all divents can dive the soddisfation .
And you get the paralives , and you get the well-being .
Everyone needs a sphere .
This is almost certainly too quickly , maybe even for the fish , and it 's sure for us .
But the above some symbolic symbolic symmmmelity , and I 'm , for the roof .
Thank you very much .
