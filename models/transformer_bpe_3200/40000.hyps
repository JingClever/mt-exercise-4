Last year I showed these slides to show that the glorious calott-acial calott-scacial calottica , which for almost three million years , had the size of 48 .
But this underlying gravity of the problem because it 's not showing the ice of ice .
The artical calotter is , in a way , the clean calculation of global climate system .
It 's win-green and winds .
The next slide will be a fast relationship to the advocation of the last 25 years .
Still pers are reported in red .
You can see , they expand to the blue .
That 's the ice in winter , which is retreatment .
You can see that the so-called the performs ice , of five years or more , is like blood , which is like blood , which is in the body .
And in 25 years , it was over , like this .
This is a problem because the heat at at the ground . It 's like the ice terrain , where there are enormous amounts of coal , which is a conducting amount of coal .
I think about the totality of about the totality of global warming , that amount could double-down , that amount could double-down , overcome this point .
In some little bit profound lage in Alaska the metan is already rebolling from water .
The professor Katey Walter of Alaska University of Alaska , a team , I 've been a fairly down the last last last hell .
Video : Wow ! Al Gore : You 're good . You know , the question is , if we 're going to be ,
A reason is that this termal exchange change Groenland from the northern North .
This is a glacial regime .
He had never never reached livels of similar .
This is the Kangerlussuaq , in the southwest of the Groenland .
If you want to know how the sea level of sea for the sea level of the sea on the ground .
These current are fast .
Another side of the planet : Antarctica , the biggest block of ice on the planet .
The last month scientists have dichieve that the balance of ice is in negative , and that the Western Antarctica , which pogggypes on some islands , is particularly rapidly in the melt leaving .
There 's a 222-foot water level , like Groenland .
Sulil Himalaya , the biggest block of ice , you see new laghi , which a few years ago were glaciers .
40 percent of the world 's population is half of the world 's population .
Sulle Ande : this glacier is the source of this city .
The ported it increased .
But when it comes , it 's the same thing is going to be able to see .
In California , the newnow 's decreased 40 percent decreased .
idrics are in crisis .
The predictions , as you have read , you were good .
Supitness , the growth in the world leads to a remarkable cenda .
The environmental disaster disaster , and the rhythm out of the normal and without precedented .
Four times more numbers in the last 30 years of respect of 75 .
This is a whole thing that is unsustainable .
If you look at it in the historical context , they can see the consequences .
In the last five years , we 've added 70 million tons of CO2 every 24 hours -- 25 million tons of tons in the ocean every day .
Look at the Eastern Pacific area , the Eastern America , towth , and both parts of the Indian subcontinent , where there is a radical oxygen in the ocean .
The major global warming , together to deforestation , which is 20 percent of them , is the use of fossil fuel fuel fuel fuel .
oil is a problem , and carbon is even worse .
The United States is one of the two of the major more emissions , together to China .
And it was proposing to build a lot of other central coal .
But we 're seeing a direction of a direction of .
These are the anullated projects over the last few years and some green alternative projects .
And so , there 's a political fight in our country .
The carbon industries and oil have spent 250 million dollars in the last year to promote carbon , which is a byly-free .
And that I would remember something --
Natal , in Tennessee , where I live , there was a 3.8 billion gallons of carbon scream .
Maybe you saw it on news .
This is the second biggest flow of flows in America .
It happened around the Christmas .
The publicity of one of the carbon industries was this .
Video : I 'm sure you know , it 's a kind of allegry and happy .
It 's abundant here in America , and it growing our economy .
Froy carbon is increasing .
It 's good price , and workers keep the stypes .
Al Gore : So , here 's a lot of the West Virginia .
The biggest mineral mineral society on the mountains is Massey Coal . This is his administrator .
Video : Don Blankenship : I 'll be clear -- Al Gore , Nancy Pelosy Pelious , Harry Reid -- they 're not going to know what they 're talking about .
Al Gore : So the Alleance for the Clima has launched two campaign .
This is one of them , one part .
Video : Acore : ALergy : ALergy , we see climate change as a sery threat to our business .
So , our priority is to invest a lot of money in a effort to make public and confused in public and confused to make public and confused the truth on carbon .
In fact , carbon is not sleep .
We think it 's clean -- it 's also a good prosmoke .
So , not pitch for climate change .
Let me do it .
Video : Acore : Carbone -- you 've heard a lot of them .
So let 's make a turn into a little bit to the lawch for how much carbon coal .
Straordinary ! The machines are a little rainer , but this is the sound of the pulyly-lit technology .
The carbon consumption is between the major global warming , but the remarkable technology that you see changes everything .
You look at a look : this is the hot coal technology of clean .
Al Gore : I finally , positive , the positive alternational security .
Video : Comment : America is in crisis ; the economy , national security , the climate crisis .
The truly connects all : our dependence on the fossil fuel , like the fossil and oil practice .
Now , but , there 's a new sun-solution , to use it .
Repower : 100 percent of clean energy in 10 years .
A plan to put America to work , to make more certainly sailing , and help to stop global warming .
Finally , a solution that is to solve our problems .
Repower . You know , more .
Al Gore : This is the last .
Video : Comment : It 's about to re-energy .
One of the fastest ways to bring up to the dependence of the combustible that killing our planet .
Comparse : The future is here . I mean , a new energy network .
Negetables .
Comment : Repower . It 's time to be realists .
Al Gore : A old African Eold : " You want to go fast , you go to fast , you go to fast yourself .
If you want to go together , you go together . "
We have to go away , fast .
Thank you very much .
Last year at TED , I did a little TED in the LHC .
And promise to return to lay on how the machine works .
So here I 'm going to do it . And for those of the other time , the LHC is the biggest scientific experiment ever tried -- 27 kilometers of circuit .
His task to rearing the conditions that were present less than a billion second , from the beginning of the universe -- to 600 million times per second .
All of that is just ambitious .
This is the Ginevra .
We 're doing this min-Big Bang 's the detectors .
This is what I work on . It 's called AS -- is 44 feet and has a 22222222222222-meters .
This is a spectacular picture of AS in building , so you can see proportions .
Ten , 10 , a last year , we accesst the machine .
And this picture was taken by AS .
It was because of immense festegation in control room .
It 's a picture of the first fascinating particles that had done all the way around the LHC , and entering in collision , with a LHC , and spread particles into the remarkable .
In other words , when we saw that that 's the 10 september , we realized that machine worked , which is a great witory .
I don 't know if it was this to do more or that , when somebody went on Google and saw that the initial page was this .
That means that we have had a cultural impact beyond to the scientific .
About a week later , there was a problem with the machine , had to have these slums here -- these slored by-dorated .
These flat 13,000 pounds when the machine works at the massive power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the massive .
Now , technical technical technical , they 're going to look at the sleep and say , " It 's not true . I 'm files too . "
And they can do it because when they 're very co--the-------the--conductors .
So , less 271 degrees , at least 271 degrees , at the one of the space between stars , these by-wild .
In one of the juncing magneti in the LHC , there was a defect of a factory .
So the files are heal , they 're going to be slightly , and 13,000 will-wild .
This was the result .
Now , this is even more impressive if you think that these magneti fish more than 20 tons , and that have moved about 30 initial inches .
They were damaged about 50 magnetic .
We had to take them , what we did .
We restinated them and adverted them .
Now they 're going to go back all to their place underground .
By the end of mark the LHC is going to be a new integral .
We 're going to access , and we expect to get data or Juuly , and we 're going to keep up with the morning , and we 're going to discover what are the universe in the morning that universe .
Now , of course , in a certain way , these accidents re-accended debate on the value of science and engineering in front of science and engineering in front . It 's easy to conviction .
I think that the fact that it 's so hard , the fact of going beyond the boundaries of things like LHC .
I 'd like to end with the words of a English scientist , Humphrey Davy , which , I imagine , in defense of the inuseful experiments of his pupile , his pupille was , and he said , " Nient is so dangerous to the progress that the human mind that the rupon are defines , that there are no mysteries in nature , that we 're not just just as a mysteries in nature , that we 're complete . "
Thank you .
I want to start asking you to rethink about when , as a children , you played cover in the morning .
As you know how to reach and make them , and get them , and get them , you know , you 're actually going to be able to think and solve problems and deal with space relationships .
The space reasoning is deeply connected to the way we understand a lot of the world around us .
So , from the information inspired by the umillity of our interaction with physical objects , together to my collaborator Jeevan Kalanithi , I started asking a , I started asking a computer , instead of having the only cursor of mb , as we use a computer , instead of having the only cursor of a desktop , we could trust brought a desktop , we could deal with a desktop ,
and how would it be our pleasure it ?
The question was so interesting that we decided to explore the answer , building Siftable .
In a few words , a Siftable computer interactive as a cookie .
In a few words , a Siftable computer interactive as a cookie .
You can move them with them , they can , " see " between them , feel their own movement and they have a screen and a wireless and a radio wireless .
But , basically , they 're physical objects , like the morning , and you can just be simply moving them to simply grasses .
Siftable is the example of a new ecosystem of tools to manipulate digital information .
And as they become more physical , conscious of their movement , and as they become more physicists , and as they become more physicists , and other , and how they 're moving them , we can explore new ways of interaction .
I 'll start with some simple example .
This Siftable is configured to show video : if you 're going to fix the video . And if you 're going to stop on the other side .
These interactive rates are ahead ahead .
If you face them , they 're interested in what they 're around .
If they 're surrounded , they can see it a little bit .
If they 're surrounded , they can see it a little bit .
And they also have their clination and inclination .
And then I realized that one of the interesting implications of the interaction was to be able to use common data , for example , to be multiple .
In this case , we have three Siftconfigurs as a bucket and I can use them to walk in the middle of color in that central , where they mix .
and I can use them to be pushing , where they 're misking .
We 're going to be too much , we can put a little bit of it .
And there are good possibilities of learning , like language , the mathematics , and logical games where people can try to do the fast things very quickly , and see the results immediately .
Now I 'm --
This is a Fibonaccount that I do with a program of equations .
Here we have a game of words that 's in the middle of Scarabeo and Boble .
Only , every turn-yourself , a letter at every Siftable , Pratically , every Siftable , and you 're looking for a letter , and as you look look look for a dictionary .
Then , about 30 seconds remimix , and you have a new set of reading and new chance to try .
Thank you .
Here we have a little children came to the Media Lab , I did this so that I tried them and I 've been showing them a video .
They 're very liked very much .
And one of the interesting things of this kind of applied , is that you don 't have to giving people a lot of instructions .
You just have to say , " Compons of words , and they know exactly what to do .
Here we can see it .
This is our younger younger tester header header header header header for the right .
It was actually wanted to stop them .
They were only bringing morning , for him .
Now , this is a appliation of a interactive cardboard .
We wanted to build a tool for the learning of Lui .
It can put new characters in the scene , by solving the Siftable them .
It can put new characters in the scene , by solving the Siftable them .
So , he 's doing it out the sun .
Video : The sun is smiling .
David Merrill : Now she took a tretor in the scene .
Video : The arange treatment .
Bel work ! Yeah !
So , the Siftable and put them up to the neighbors can get the characters --
Video : Bau !
-- inventing their story .
Video : Hi !
DM : It 's a story with the open , and it can decide him like .
DM : It 's a story with the open , and it can decide him like .
Very : Fince .
DM : The last example I have time to show you a time is a tool , made of recent , to sample and exececutility .
is a tool , made of recent , to sample and executives music .
Siftable here to be sounds like the base , and the battery .
Each one of these has four different variations , and you can choose which to use .
You can also put these sound in a sequence to be able to comproof your pleasure .
And you just just to take it a " sound and a sequence . "
These are actually actually you can control from the live , like the reverber and the filter .
The sound of a particular sound and then fixing sound .
And then there are the general effects like time and volume , which are applied to the entire sequence .
Let 's look at how it works .
Video : We 're going to start putting a base in two Siftable , we 're going to be sequence , we can extend to another base .
Now I 'll put a bottom line .
Video : I add the percussions --
Video : I 'll put the film on the bacteria , so I can control the live effect .
Video : I can fast the whole sequence of the whole sequence , by one side , or another .
Video : I 'll add the bottom filter to get more expression .
Video : I can recombine the sequence of the flight .
So I didn 't have to planning it before , but I can improvise , and it 's a very long or a lot .
And now , finally , I can see the whole sequence of the whole sequence on the left , Siftable .
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is to build new mo-machine interfacts and more resembles how our brain work and body .
And today , I had time to show you one of the results of this path , and also some chance we try to bring out of the lab .
The concept I want to transmit is that it 's coming to this new generation of designed objects to interact with digital media , which will bring information in our world in the way we want .
Thank you very much .
I don 't see the time to talk to all of you .
I 'm a writer .
I 'm going to crude books is my profession , but it 's more than this , of course .
It 's also love and love my life .
And I don 't know that it can change .
But , said , something particular has happened in my life and career , and my career , which has brought me to get the whole relationship with this work .
The particular thing is that I recently wrote this book , this whose whose name called Mandia , Prega , Ama , " which , diversally from my previous books , for some reason came out in the world and became a big , besttie fe-interational , and the interational interational .
And the result is that everywhere , people are treat me as you were convicted .
It 's true -- you know , convicted .
They 're all going to be worried and say , " You 're not fear to do better ?
You don 't care to keep out of life writing and I can 't be able to create a book that can be important to somebody ? "
that can be importance to somebody ? "
It 's security , you know .
But it could go worse , except that I remember that over 20 years ago , when I started saying to people -- I was a teenager -- I wanted to be a writer .
I would go to the same reaction based on the fear .
And people said , " Don 't you could not be able to succeed ?
Does you don 't care that the ulient of you kill ?
You don 't fear to do this wearing for all life , nothing that 's ever out and die on a heart of infrankly dream of infranked with the by-loving cenergized ? "
So , you know .
The answer -- the brief answer to all these questions is , " Yes . "
Yeah , I 'm afraid of all those things .
I 've always had fear .
And I 'm also fear to many other things that people can 't guess .
As the algae and other frightening things .
But , as it was about to write what I thought and ask me , and I would say a few demand , that 's why ?
Is it rational ?
It 's logical that anybody to wait to be very frightened by a job that you 've been doing .
But what is that particular in the impress that makes us nervous health care about mental health health health health health health care in one way that other careers don 't do ?
How my father , for example , he was a chemist engineer and I didn 't remember one time in his 40 years of activity in his 40 years of activities that she asked him if he was afraid to be engineer ?
There was never -- that there was that John , what does John , what does ?
He didn 't work like that , did you know ?
Onestly , chemical engineers like group they don 't certainly , in the centuries , earnly , in the centulized reputation of depressves .
We have writers , we have enough this reputation , and not just writers , but creatives of all kinds of kinds of instable . We have this reputation of being enormous .
And it 's not something else that look at the sad of the deaths of the magnificments of creative magnifetime , and often died young people .
And the ones that don 't suicide the ones that are really not suicidun-wildlife .
Norman Mailer , before I die , in the last interview , in the last interview said , " I 've been a little more more , a wonderful deaper for their work .
But we don 't bat when we feel that , because we 've heard these things so long that in some way , we 've completely interior and accepted the notion that creativity and suffering are somehow tied and the art , in the end , it will always be readed and the art , in the end , it will always be reading the art .
And the question I want to ask all of today is : Are you agree with this idea ?
You know this thing -- because it also looks like to be a hundred of distance to me to do not good for this support .
I think it 's objectious .
And I think it 's also dangerous and I don 't want to see the perpetuated perpetuated perpetuated in the next century .
I think it 's better to encourage our big creative minds .
And I certainly know that , in my case -- in my situation -- it would be very dangerous to start to smoking up the circumstances that I 'm in my career .
That 's what I mean , you look like , I 'm pretty young , I have about 40 years .
I have about four work in me .
And it 's very likely that whatever I 'll do with now in and then it 's going to be judged by the world as the work that came out of my last book .
I 'm going to be slavery , because we 're all more friends here -- is likely that my biggest succeeds .
Oh , Gesus , what thought !
You know this is the kind of thought that leads a person to start to drink in the nine of the nine of the morning and I don 't want to do it .
I would keep on doing this work that I love .
So , the question becomes , what ?
And so , it seems to me , after a lot of reflective , which the way of working to keep in a psychological costrucstruct , OK ?
I have to find a way of security distance between me , which I 'm writing , and my natural anxiety that writing , and I was trying to do it , and as I was trying to do it to look through time , trying to find other society , trying to find other society to see if they could have more better ideas and more healthy healthy ideas to see if they could have more healthy ideas to see if they could have more healthy ideas and more healthy ideas to see if they could have more healthy ideas to see if they
about how to help creative people manage to deal with emotional risks of creativity .
And that research has led me to the Grek and ancient Rome ancient .
I 'm going to be in your circle and then it comes back .
In the ancient Grek and ancient Rome -- people didn 't seem to believe that creativity came from men , OK ?
And it was thinking about creativity was this spirit to look at and that were human beings from one some distant source and unknown , for distant reasons .
The Greeks were called these spiriters of the creative demon the cream of demand .
Socrate , wonderful , wonderful , believed to have a wisdom that was wisdom wisdom .
The Rooms were of the same idea , but they were called that kind of spirit .
That 's great , because Rooms were not really thought that a genius was a particularly smart .
They had to be this kind of divine entity was this divine of a kind of an artist , a little bit like the elpho Dobby , and that was a little like the elpho Dobby , and that was the work of the artist and models the result of the work of the artist and modeling the result of that work .
Except -- here 's the distance of which I talk about -- that psychological co-protecting you from your work work .
And everybody knew that that was how it worked , right ?
So the anti-artists were protected to certain things , like , for example , too much narcism , right ?
If your work was exceptional , you couldn 't take it all the smart , all of you know that you were helped by this genius incorporeous .
If your work failed , it was not all your , right ?
And everyone knew that it was your genius to be a incapable .
And so people han conceived creativity for a long time .
And then the Renciement came and everything changed , and it was all about this big idea . We put the human being center of the universe above all the mysteries and without leave space creatures .
This was the rational principle of humanity and people started thinking about creativity was completely from the issues .
And for the first time in history , he started to reflip to this or artist as a genius , like a genius ,
And I have to tell you , I think that was a big error .
I think that allow somebody , a simple person to believe that being like a recipient as a source , the essence and the source of all the mysteries , creativity , unknown , unknown , unknown as a big , , too much to give to give the human breakthrough the fragile .
It 's like to ask somebody to ingoiate the sun .
Deforms and completely distores the ego and creates all these inexible expectations on performance .
And I think it was this pressure to the artists in the past 500 years .
And , if this is true , and I think that it is , and now ?
Can we do that diversity ?
Maybe back to a more ancient understanding of the relationship between human and creative mystery .
Or maybe not .
Maybe we can 't just sing 500 years of thinking in a talk in a talk of 18 minutes .
And there 's probably people in the audience who would solve suspect scientific on the news , you know , you know , they follow the next people by brought the next people , by doing the projects .
I 'm probably not going to convince you all about this .
But the question I 'd like to ask is -- why not ?
Why don 't you think that this way ?
Because it has more sense of everything else that ever heard to explain the exasperant imprevedibility of the creative process .
A process that , as anyone who ever tried to do something -- so , basically , everybody here -- knows , basically , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , basically , you know , you 're all here --
And , in fact , it can sometimes be completely paranormal .
I did this meeting recently meeting Stone , who has now 90 years old , but that was a poetd for all life and said to me that during her childhood in the rural Virginia , worked out in the rural Virginia , he worked out in the field , and he was feed by the way .
He said that it was like a fragorous train .
And that was coming to rotoling to her landscape .
He felt that he was going to try to get the earth under his feet .
He knew he had one thing to do to do at that point and was of , his words , " running like a map . "
And it goes to the house and it was going to be sent from this poetry , and it should not make a little piece of paper and a major a pretty quickly from the page , and the traps and grassed it on the page .
Other three times he couldn 't be fast enough , so he goes and correcreceive and he would not be able to get to home and her lost her , and she would reached her through and she lost her , and he would continue to return through the landscape , and she said , " another poet . "
And then there were those times -- this piece I 'll never forget -- there were moments where she was almost losing , OK ?
So , he was running home and he was looking for paper and she was looking for paper in , and she was a major in the time , and then he said , that was like , and then he was like , and then he was going to go and he would recently stepped up with the other hand and the conflict .
He crubbed the poetry from the tail and remain her body and she was transcrited it on the page .
And in these cases , the poetry would be presented on the perfect page , and the last word on the last word .
So when I heard that -- I was crazy , it 's exactly the same thing as my creative process .
Not all my creative process -- I 'm not a conviction .
I 'm a mule , and my way to work is ; you see me at the same orary every day and play and work and pass it over the goffly .
But even I have a text of my headard , I 've been shot against that thing , sometimes .
And I imagine many of you you can han it .
You know , even if the work and ideas were being source to a certain source , you can 't be honestly knowledge .
And what is this thing ?
And how can we relate to it in a way that we don 't lose your head , but rather , what do we do to be skiing skiing ?
As it is about , the best contemporary example I have is the musician Tom Waits , which I 've interviewed several years ago for a newspaper .
We were talking about this , and you know , Tom , for the majority of life was the incarnation of the toothist , trying to control , and manage , to deal , manage , to deal , manage , to dominating these species of impults .
But then he got invent , he calculated , and one day as he was driving on a Los Angeles , he changed everything for him .
He was going to fast the whole thing , and it 's all this little fragment of myelody , which comes in his head as inspiration , elusive and alectant , and the desidst wants , and the desider wants , but it 's not how to take it .
It 's not a piece of paper , it 's not a matt , it has no registered registered .
So he starts to hear this old species of old anxioned anxioned , and I 'm going to lose , and I 'm going to be obsessed by this song alone .
I 'm not good enough and I can 't do it . "
And instead of going to go to the panic , stopped .
And I 'll be in the whole mental process and did something completely new .
He just just just just the sky and said , " Scause , I 'm not driving ? "
" Do you look like that can write a song now ?
If you really want to exist , you get me to get care of you .
Other one , you 're going to importunexpecting somebody else today .
You know , you know , Leonard Cohen . "
And his work process changed after that .
Not the work , it was still dark as a always .
But the process , and the heavy anxiety that was releft when he took it genius , the genius that out of him was remaining it back to where it was , by doing that he was not to be remaining it back from where he was , realizing that he had not to be a interized , and then then remained it .
but you know , this peculiar , wonderful bizarre collaboration between Tom and this strange thing that was not Tom .
So , how that I felt that story started to change a little bit that I was working and I had a time .
This idea , I rescued when I was writing " Mangia , Prega , Ama , and fall in one of those of the disperation cave , we all of working on something and we can 't , and we 're not going to start thinking that it will be the worst book that would be written .
Not just bad book , right the worst book written .
And I started thinking about thanks this project .
But then I reminded to me of Tom who talked to the air and I tried it .
So I got my face on the face of the wild , and I was comments to a vacuum of the room .
And I said , " Look , what , you 're both , and you know , if this book is not going to be bright , my own own ?
Because as I see I 'm putting all of that I have , no longer than this .
So if you want to be better , you have to show you and do your side .
OK . But if you don 't do it , you know what , I don 't do it .
I 'll report to write the same because it 's my work .
And I 'd like to do for that I today to do my part of today , I presented to do my part , " because -- finally it 's like , OK -- -- a hundred people in the deserts were giated for dances to sacks and music that they were going to go to the date of the dances that they were just just just to go to the dawn .
And they were always magnificent , because the dances were professional and they were great .
But every once once , rarely , something happened , and one of these artists were actually transforming .
And I know what I do , you know you all saw this , because I know you all saw , at some point , a performance that .
It was like a time , and the dances walked through a kind of landed , and she was not doing anything different from the usual , like 1,000 night before , but everything was all out .
And suddenly , it doesn 't look at the as a human .
But it 's accurate from the diinside and below light in the grid of divinity .
And when this happened , when this was the time , people knew what was , they called him .
They were conducting their hands and started singing , " Allah , Allah , God , God , " God , God , "
That 's God , you know .
And it was historical , when the Spain , I got the south of Spain , I got this habitude with them and ready to change in the centuries from " Allah , Allah , Allah , Allah , " to " Ole , " " " " " Ole , " , " which you can still feel in the corrids or flew .
In Spain , when a artist did something impossible and magical , " Allah , " Allah , Allah , wonderful , " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " Allah , " In Spain , " Spain , " Allah , " In Spain , " Allah , " , " In Spain ,
And it 's great because we need it .
But , the problem comes day , for the dances , and it turns out that , when you wake up and discovering that are 11 in the morning of Martedday and the last last of God .
It 's just a bad mortal with bad in the ginock , and maybe it 's not going to be able to achieve that height .
And maybe nobody will be there , the name of God 's still going to go on , and what does with the rest of his life ?
It 's hard .
This is one of the most painful recognized to make in a creative life .
But maybe it doesn 't have to be so angotten if you can 't believe , and you 're in the major more extraordinary aspects of your being being being to be to be to you .
But you 'd just believe that you 're prested by a unimaginable source of this pointed cement of your life that you have to go to somebody else when you 're finished .
And , you know , if we think it 's all this way .
And so I started thinking about it , and it 's certainly how I thought I 've been thinking about it for several months during the work of the book that I 'll be done , the dangerous , attesissues followed the of my great success .
And what I have to keep telling me when I feel electric .
It 's not just your work .
It 's a presenting shot you for your side , any can be .
If you 're your work is dancing , you know .
If the divine , absurd genius to you assigned decide to leave some kind of wonderful wonderful , for one moment through your effort , then , " Ole ! "
Other , you do that you do that you 're all about .
And " Ole ! " to you yourself .
I think , and I think we should teach it .
" Ole ! " to you yourself , even for having human and testing targin tal and headtale tale of you to present you continue .
Thank you .
Thank you .
June Cohen : Ole !
As you know , I 've talked about some of these projects on the human genome , what can mean and on the discovery of new genes .
Now we 're starting a new path : we started digitalizing biology and now starting from that code are going into a new new biology , designing and designing and willing and synthetizing life .
We always tried to ask for big questions .
What is life ? " It 's something that many biologists have tried to understand layers .
We tried different processes , reduced it to minimds .
We 're digitizing from almost 20 years .
When we sequenced the human genome was to spend from analome of the computer world in the digital world of the computer world .
Now let us ask us : can we regenerate life , or create new life from this digital universe ?
This is the map of a little organism , the Mycoplasma genitalium , which is the smaller genome between those who can authorean .
And we tried to reduce the genome to create a little bit smaller .
We can eliminate a hundred genes of genes of about 500 than here .
But when we look at his map of metabolic map , it 's relatively simple than our .
I believe me , this is simple .
But when we look at all the genes that we can eliminate , one one one to the time , it 's very unlikely that this can bring a living cells .
So we decided that the only way to progree to be synthesize this chromosoma so that we could modify the components to bring some of these fundamental questions .
And so we started the adventure of " can we synthesize a chromosome ? "
Can it to conhear that we 're going to have these big molecules that we never have been able to create before ?
And , in case , can we make a chromosome work ?
A chromosome is just a piece of inert material .
The speed that we 're able to digitalize life is growing to reverse exponential .
Our ability to write genetic code , instead , progret , but it 's getting quite slowly , but it 's improving .
And our most recent results results , the results results .
We 've been on 15 years ago .
The process has requmany passages , starting with a bioethical re-view , before we started the first experiments .
But we found that synthesize DNA is very difficult .
There are tens of thousands of machines in the world that produce small segments of DNA , long , long , and it 's a degenerative process : the longer , the segment is longer , the segments .
So we had to develop a new method to assembly these fragments and correcrect the mistakes .
And this was our first attempt , in the same way as we have , from the digital genome of Phi X-4 genome 174 .
It 's a little virus that kill bacteria .
We designed the fragments , we did the fragments of the error and get a DNA molecule of about 5,000 leckle .
The interesting part is when we took this piece of the inert chemical material , and we put it in bacteria , the bacteria , the bacteria have started reading this genetic code and produring the viral particles .
The viral particles have been released by cells , they went back and went back and destroyed the E.
I talked about recent with the oil industry by saying that they certainly compresed this model .
They 've reverse more than you .
We believe that this is a situation where software really can build its own hardware in a biological system .
But we wanted to do the biggest things .
We wanted to build the whole chromosome of the bacteria .
They 're over 580 thousand genetic code .
So we thought we build it in the size of the virus , so we can change the cassets to understand what are the components of a living cells .
Does crucial , and if we start with digital information in a computer , these have to be very accurate .
When we sequenced this genome for the first time in 1995 accuractivity was a mistake for every 10 thousand basis .
We found , we resequenced it , 30 errors . If we had that original sequence that original sequence would never be able to do it work .
One part of the process is to design a 50 segments that overlap with all the other 50 leckeless to build subunits to build subunits to build subunits better subunits working together .
We try to unique elements here .
You probably have read that we 're probably reading that we put in the bull .
So think about this : we have a genetic code based on four letters : A , C , G and T.
Three of those letters together with about 20 adictory , and there 's a specific order of reading for every friendly order to reading for every friendly .
So we can use genetic code to write words , frases , thinking .
What we did in the beginning was autographed to do it .
Some of them have been dollar that was not poetry .
We designed these segments to just join them with enzymes .
There are enzymes that repair them and put them on .
And we started assembly assembly , starting with segments from five to seven milecture , unending up segments in a way to form 72 thousands of leckers who were only only only at 72 ,
And every step we made these segments in abundance , so we can sequencing them from being able to sequencing a very robling processing -- as you 'll see in a minute .
We 're trying to automatize the process .
So , this seems like the tabellon of a basket player .
When we get these very long , more than 100 mile basis , more than 100 mile basis , they 're going to grow more directly in the E.
You get to the limit of modern biology of molecular biology .
So we looked at other mechanisms .
We knew about another mechanism called recombination omologists , which in biology is to repair the DNA to join the DNA to join a DNA to join a segments .
Here 's an example .
This organism , called Deinococcus radiococcus , can absorb three million radiation .
You can see in the upper square like his chromosome as his chromosome .
In 12 -- 24 hours , it 's reassembled exactly like it was before .
There are thousands of organisms that they can do it .
These organisms , you can completely sitting .
They can live under a vacuum .
They 're absolutely certainly that life exist in space , and you know , to find new rich water .
ASA showed that , the NASA showed this .
This is a picture of the molecule that we built using these processes , just using these processes , just using the segments of segments to put up .
Your yeast assemble them automatically .
This image was not taken with a microscope with an electronic microscope .
It 's a molecule so that we can see it with a microscope .
These are pictures that cover a time of about six seconds .
This is the puzzle we did a little bit of time ago .
They 're over 580,000 letters of genetic code .
It 's the biggest molecule of a defined structure .
It 's got 300 million or molecular weight .
If you stay it with a 10 without spaces , we 'd like to 142 pages just to transcrude this genetic code .
Now , how do we do it work ? How can we do that ?
Obviously , you 've got a game .
It 's a little more complicated when you use bacteria .
It 's simpler when it 's about eucariariote cells like our : you can just extracks the nucleus and put one more , which is basically the process of cloning process .
In the archaea bacteria the chromosome , but we 've recently demonstrated that we 're able to do a birthday that we 're able to do a crmosome from a cell to another and to attract it .
We clean a crumosome from a microbial cromosome of the microbial .
The two are different as men from mouse .
We have added some gene more so that we can decide what to choice for this chromosome .
And then , he skied the enzymes to kill all the proteins .
And when we put it in the cells was wonderful -- and you 're going to be able to appreciate our sophisticato-- the new chromosome -- the new chromosome --
And we were actually thinking that we couldn 't go beyond , but we tried to push it out there .
This is one of the major mechanisms of evolution .
We found that a lot of anti-species have added a second or a chromosome , and adding in a second thousand new traits to that species .
So who thinks about evolution as a one gene at the time that has not understood a lot of biology .
There are some enzyme called restriction enzymes that enzyme to digit .
The chromosome that was in the cells , it doesn 't have one .
The cell phone chromosome that we have inserit-down .
He expressed , and he recognized the other exranean chromosome , the other exranean cell , and we found us with only the cells and the new chromosome .
It 's become blue because of the genes that we put in .
And in a brief leap of time , all the characteristics of a species , went through all new species , based on the new software that we put in cells in cells .
All the proacts have changed , the members have changed , and when we read the genetic code , exactly what we 've transferred to the genetic code that .
Now , this may seem like this genetic altering , but altering DNA software , we can change things very substantial things .
Now , I 've already explained that that you don 't talk about genesis -- but to progress from three million years and a half of evolution , and I said that maybe we 're going to create a new version of Cambrian explosion in which will be created new species on this digital process .
Why do that ?
I think it 's quite obvious when we think about our necessities .
We 're going to be six billion and a half of people in the next 40 years .
Just to give an example : I was born in 1946 .
Now there are three people on the planet for each existing in 1946 years , there will be four .
We 're having problems with now to find food , fresh water and clean , medicine for six and a half billion and a half billion people .
It 's going to be even more harder to do it for nine billion .
We use more five billion carbon carbon , more than 30 billion baris , more 30 billion baris of oil .
That means a hundred million barrel a day .
When we try to find biological processes , or any kind of replace to replace them , it will be a huge challenge .
And we have to keep the whole hemisphere of CO2 from these materials that goes into the atmosphere .
And today , because of the scientific discoveries all over the world , we have a database with about 20 million genes , and I like to think that are the design components for the future .
The electronic industry , you can only only one dozen of things , and think about how many different things are coming out .
Our limits are just a principle of biological and our imagination .
Now we have a techniques , because of these rapidly methods , able to create what we call combinatory genomics .
We can build a big robot that can produce a big robot that can produce a million chromosomes a day .
Think of processing these 20 million genes , or to prove the processes to produce either drug or drug , new vaccines , and we can change , because of a small team , and create more biology now that in the last 20 years of science .
And it 's just a standard selection .
We can choose to survival , chemical production or fuel , or fuel production , chemical production .
This is an instantaneous instantaneous instantaneous software that we 're working to be able to be able to design species .
Well , we don 't necessarily know how it will be .
We know exactly how their genetic code .
Now we 're focusing on the fourth generation of fourth generation .
You also saw you that that extract thanol ethanol , it was a bad experiment .
We have a second and third generation of the second , and third generation that will be used to be the higher value of higher value as the eight-sorts of butants .
But the only way that biology can have a great impact without increasing the cost of food and limitarly , the cost of food and limitary the CO2 in matter before , so we 're working to design cells that can get to design cells that can be able to reach this purpose to design cells that can be able to achieve this purs , and think we can have the first carbon in about 18 months .
The solar light combined with CO2 is a metodo-- but in our discovery different discovery .
This is a organism that we have described in 1996 .
It lives in the deep ocean , about 2,500 feet deep at the temperature of water .
It 's a methane from CO2 molecular hydrogen of energy .
We 're trying to figure out if we can uncanalate CO2 , which can easily be transported through tramed , to drive that CO2 in the carbon , to drive this process .
So , very short think we could be able to increase what 's life is , " which is , " What 's life " We , grew up . " We , grew the whole goal of replace the whole oil oil oil oil oil oil oil oil oil oil oil oil .
Exactly . If you can 't do that from TED , where can you ?
It would be a main of energy .
And also , we 're working for using the same metods to create instantaneous vaccine vine .
You saw this year with the flu , we 're always back to a year and a dollar , and less when it comes to find the right vaccine .
I think that that you can change building combinable vaccines in antiicial advertising vaccines .
So , what the future could start looking like this could start to be changing , now , the evolution of the evolution , by accelerating evolution with synthetic bacteria , and eventually cells .
We 're at that time , we 're at the improving people .
Our purpose is to make a way of living enough to try and do it . Thank you very much .
First of all , I 'll be able to see , the fastest possible , some fundamental technology that we took the Microsoft in a year ago . It 's almost a year ago . This is Seadron .
It 's a environment that you can interact with is at local level that remote with a huge amount of data .
And we 're seeing a lot of gigabyte pictures of digital phoom with a kind of zoom and continuous , for a panoramic fast , and we have the images as we want to .
And not matter how big it is the amount of information we see , how big we 're big these collecting data or images .
Most are common photographs , but this for example , is a scanning from the Library of Congress , and it reenter the rance of 300 megapile .
It does not have a difference because the only thing that limits of a system like this is the number of pixel on your screen in your screen in your screen in your screen in your your screen in your screen in your screen in your screen in your screen . It 's also a very fle-up , because the only thing that 's the prestation of a system like this is the number of pixel on your screen in your screen in your screen in your screen .
This is a book , example of data not imagery .
This is the Casa desolated Casa desolate chapter .
To show you that it 's just like this , and not images , we can do something like this , to actually actually , to actually see that this is a real representation of the text , not a picture .
It could be a way a little artificial way to read an electronic book .
Not you recommense it .
This is a more realistic example . It 's a number of The Guardian .
Every image is the beginning of a section .
And it really gives you the pleasure and the bel experience of reading the real cartaceful version of a magazine or a daily , which is for a moltex .
We also did something with the angle of the Ladian .
We created a high resolutionary , higher solutionetheless -- and we put in a normal advertising advertising .
If you want to see the feature of this automobile , you can see it here .
Or other models , or even the specific techniques .
And this really shows some of these ideas to eliminate the limits of space on the screen of space .
We hope that that means to put up to the pop-up and other porcheries like , and other porcheries , you don 't have to be necessary .
Of course , the map is one of the most obvious applications for this kind of technology .
And I don 't want to lose time , if we don 't say that we have contribute to giving in this field .
These are all the streets in the U.S. overlawchamber and a geospace image .
So , we 're going to go to something else .
This is now actually the live on the Web ; you can go to the web .
This is a project called Photosynthetic , which combine two different technologies .
One is Seadragon and the other is a very interesting computer research in Noah Snavely , a student of the University of Washington , with Steve Seitz of UW Seitz of UW and Rick Szeliski in Microsoft Rick Szeliski . A good collaboration .
And it 's from the Web , managed by Seadragon .
You can see that when we do this kind of screen , where we can spend from one image to another and have this kind of experience of multiple solution .
But the spacecraft location of images here actually has a meaning .
The computer algorithms of the computer visualization that are recorded these pictures together , so that correspond to real places that are in -- all of the close to Grasis on Montagne Rockoples on the Rockpies -- you 're taken . Here you see the elements of a de-ex-stable imaging , and these things are all connected to the spatial level .
I don 't know if I have time to show you some other environment .
There are a few more space-deal with it .
I want to move directly to one of the original data of Noah-- and this is a previous Photosynth-prototype of Photosynthetic , which we 've done the first summer , to show you what I think is really the key to do is is really the key to this technology , Photosynthetic technology . And it 's not necessarily clear looking at that we 've put in the website .
We had to worry about legal aspects and so on .
This is a re-building of Notre Dame pictures taken from Flickr . Bast digit-digitary Notre Dame in Flickr and you get images of types , other of the campus and so on . You know , each of these orange orange arange . It 's one of these orange orange . It 's a picture that has discovered to this model .
So , they 're all images from Flickr and they were all connected to space level in this way .
And it 's possible to navigate this very very very simple way .
You know , I never thought I 'd be finished to work for Microsoft .
It 's very gratifying to receive this kind of accovery , there .
I think you can see that it 's a lot of different typical photocameras : from the cell phones to the SLR professional , meaning , put together in this environment .
And if I can , I try and try and try and try and get those strange .
A lot of them are blocked by faces , etc .
Somewhere you find a series of photographs -- here .
This is a Notre of Notre Dame record .
We can go from poster to the physics of this environment .
The essential point is that we can do things with social environment . This is now taking data from the whole whole memory of how to apply the whole memory of how to apply the land , from the visual point of -- and connects all of those data together .
All those pictures become connected together , the major of the sum of the parts .
You have a model of the land that emerging .
Think about this as a prolungation of Stephen Lawler 's work on Earth .
It 's something that grows in complexity as people are using it , and whose advertising to the people who use it .
Their pictures are husers with inseries of other people .
If you get the idea of contrassigning all of these sorts of things , and my picture of Notre Dame suddenly , I suddenly re-flies of all those data , and I can use it as a point of entertaining for immersed to that space , in that metapuniverse , using the photos of wherever , and have a cross-moved social experience of cross-mod-moved ,
Of course , a consequence of all that are very virtual models of every other interesting side of the Earth , and that 's not just seen achieved plane and satellite imagery and similar imagery and similar imagery .
Thank you .
Chris Anderson : I realized what your software is that you 're going to take us to do is that at a certain point , in the next few years , all the photographs are going to be practically connected together ?
BAA : Yeah . What 's doing is basically to discover .
He 's creating hyperlink , if you want , you want to , between images .
And he 's doing it in the content of images .
The thing is very interesting if you think about the richness of semantic information that many of these images .
As when you 're doing a research of the Web , you type a phrase and the text on the web page has a lot of information about pictures .
Now , what if that picture is that picture you 're going to be connected to all your pictures ?
So the amount of semantic interconnection and the amount of semantic interconnection and the amount of semantic interconnection .
CA : Blaise , it 's really incredible . Compekeeping .
BAA : Thank you very much .
One of the main pleasure when you travel and one of the peoples of the peoples , you can 't get antial those traditions , between who has no antic traditions , between the wind , the past in the wind , the wind it in the wind , the stone of them in the stone wind , levision it in the stone of the plants .
And that the sciamani Jaguar traveling to beyond the Lattea , or that the elders of the old Inuit are still in a lot of meanthropology , or Himalaya , the buddune the buddoughly of anthropology , and the idea that the world in which we live in which we live in in a sense , in which we live in a sense , in which we live in absolute , but it 's just a model of reality ,
the consequence of a particular adaptive set of adaptive choices that our estrpitches did , well , or bad , many generations .
And , of course , we all shared essential traits .
We all pros . We all proof .
We are subjects in the repairs .
We have to deal with the inexorability of death , so we 're not surprising us to sing and whom --
We all have an art .
What it 's the particular rhythm of the song , the rhythm of every culture .
It doesn 't matter that matter that they 're the Penan forests of Borneo , or the follow-of-Haiti , or the desert warriers of Kenya in Kenya sector in Kenya , the Curander of Ande , or a sweet camping in the Sahara .
He was my journey in desert a month ago , or a yak from the Everest , the yak in the Everest , the dey mother devices , the death mother .
All of these populations teaching us that there are other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , other ways of moving around the world .
And , if you reflect a moment , it 's a concept that it can give you hope .
And together , we have a world of cultures of the world are creating a ragnosis of cultural life and is important for the well-being , and it 's important for the well-being of the planet as a biosphere .
And you can think about this cultural re-in-the-well-called an etnosphere and you can call the total bysphere , the whole whole concepts , dreams , ideas , inspiring , and mites , intuitions , and intuitions , and you can call it the human imagination of human alone .
The thanisphere is the wonderful patrial of humanity .
It 's the symbol of what we 're and what we can be in how inquisitive species .
And because the biosphere was very , very , very , very , consumed to be as a lot fast .
Nobody biologist , for example , 50 percent of all species was or is on the orders simply because it 's fake , or -- in the most apocalyptic -- in the field of biological diversity -- and not even close to the most optimistic issue -- that 's not even even even even in the most optimistic ises -- that 's also cultural diversity .
The index of that is , of course , the language persites .
When you 're born 6,000 languages on this planet .
A language is not just composed by a vocabulary or a series of rules .
A language is the human spirit of the human spirit .
It 's the middle of which animal is in the material world .
Every language is a forest of mind , a bacin the mind , a tooth-to-possibility , spiritual possibility .
And of those 6,000 languages , as we 're in Monterey , at least , half the half of them is not supply in in the orchies of children .
They 're not teaching kids , that means , unless than to kids , which means , unless than something , which are already died .
What is there more sad than you 've been fly by the silence , of being the last last to talk a language , of being the wisdom of the wisdom of the promise of the promise of the children ?
This is a facing one of the state of some of the world every two weeks : every two weeks a old mur and door with it in the tomble syllabomic language .
And I know some of you will say , " isn 't it much better ?
The world would not be a better place if you 're talking to all the same language ? " Benissim , then we talk to all yoruba . Let 's talk to the doctor . We talk to the cantonese .
Let 's talk about kogue .
You 'll be a sudden you can 't talk about your language .
And I 'd like to be to do a journey through the etnosphere --
a little journey in the etnosphere to give you a murse of what we 're losing .
A lot of us forget that when I say , " different ways of exist , " I mean , very different ways of exists .
Let 's take for example , Barasana Barasana , in Amazonia , the people of anacond anacond , which creates the myth to come from from the river of the east in the east of the east in the slatte slatte slatte s-slatte slatte slatte .
It 's a popular popular that it 's not able to distinguish the bllue bllue from the green because you were identified in the forest , which depends the population depends .
They have a strange language and a major major called a major language , " examist " : " You have to marry a different language .
All that has radical in the past mythological , yet the particular particular particular , is that in these exese families in which they talk to six or seven languages because of marriages marriages .
They 're just going to listen to and then start talking .
We take one of the most interesting tribe that I 've lived , the Waorans of Ecuador north , an incredible popular popular that has the first contacts in 1958 .
In 1957 five missionary missionaries have tried a de-mistake mistake .
They did down the photographs that rate them in a glowing them in a glass that they were loaded , and forest that this population of the forest , had never seen anything bi-size of a two-dimensional size .
They collected the land , they 've been showed , they 've been showed , or a shape , or a figture and , not finding anything , they were going to kill the five missioners with the mosters .
But Waorans don 't kill the strange .
They were killing in them .
54 percent of the mortality was caused by themselves .
We have been eight generations to eight generations of natural death and when we 've been reported to know , they lose one of them was aged so that he 's dead invecently , and then killed it killed it the same .
The hunters were able to recognize the animal .
In the early ' 80s , I had a very interesting task when my professor of Harvard , and he asked me if I wanted to go to Harvard to intruly intruly the society of Duvalier and Tonton Macodly and Tonton Macoud the potence that I used to do the zombie .
To make a sense of a miracolost , I should have to understand Vodoo culture is not magic .
It 's quite a complex view of the world .
A lot of interesting .
If I asked you to tell me the big religions of the world , what would you say ?
Christianity , Islam , Buddism , Ebraism , etc .
A continent is always left out , thinking that sub-Saharan Africa doesn 't have any religious feeding . And it 's the Vodoo is not more than the distilside of these religious concepts of nation , very profound born of slavery .
What makes the voodoo is the intense relationship between life and death .
So , the alive of the spirits .
The spirits can be invoced by the Great Acqua , they response to the rhythm of the dance of the dance of the vision in a way that for a brief active following the following becomes the god .
So , for that voodooers love to say , " You white to go on to the God .
We say God . "
And from the moment you 're all sitting , is the spirit that you 're driving , as you can get to it ?
So you see these incredible events : follow aces in state of trance that you have a tiny deed with a demonstration , rather strong , demonstration demonstration than the body when it 's catalyzed in a state of excitation .
I 've been visited by the most extraordinary of the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta , in the Sierra Nevada , in the secentrional Colombia .
It was scending of the tyranges that once once they were living on the caraibia on the Colombia 's tremendous , the popular of the vulkknee planning , which is on charge on charge of caraibical planning .
In a blood continent snaked , this people never been conquisted by Spanish .
But today they 're governed by a cler-, but their formation is very extraordinary .
The young people followed up in the families , and they 're sitting in a world that 's made of dark and shadow in a world that 's made of dark and shadow in the stone world of the glaciers for 18 .
Two periods nine years of proposes to reproduce the nine months of management that they spend in the users of the mother , they 're now in the users users users users , now are metaphorically in the users of the Great Mother .
For this time , they 're acculturate to the values of their society , values that they 're prayers to keep the constantly prayer , or to say the balance balance of the cosmic balance --
At term of this incredible initiation , they 're suddenly taken out and for the first time in their life , at 18 years , they see a whole thing of the first ball , when the sun is the values of the first ball of the things that they 've learned in theory . The prete a walk back and say , " it 's all of the splecraft . And the prete a step back , and says ,
" See ? I said , you know , what I said .
It 's amazing . Now it 's now to you protect it . "
They 're called the major brothers and say that we , minords , we are the destruction of the world .
This level of intuition is extremely important .
When we think about Ingene populations and the environment invote Rousseau and the old story of the wild , which is a razer concept in his simplicity or magic . And we 're invote that these popular people are closer to Earth .
The Ingenes are not feeling or feeling or not feeling or stalugal .
There 's no space for these things in the Asmat the malaric palual winds , but thanks to the race of Tibet , but because of the time and the rhold , they 've created a mystical intuition of the Earth 's 's not about the concept of human conscious .
What does that mean ?
He wants a kid who grow up in the world 's growing up to believed that the mountain a wild , and it will be a human being deeply different and will be human being deeply different and will be human being a deep-like being a very different , with the mountain a boy of the Montana , who grows up to be screw .
That 's a demad-one one one or a mineral cuts is irrelevant .
What 's interesting is the metaphor that defines the relationship between the individual and natural world .
I grew up in British 's Columbia 's forest , credating that the forest of being cut .
And that made me a human being different from my friends Kwautl friends who believe that the forests are the Hamkukukukuk and the bat the paradise and the cannibal bee that live to the extreme of the world , beans who are living in the Hamatsa .
If you start to consider that these cultures can create different reality , you can start understanding some of them feeling . We take this plants .
I took this aprile to the ndoctor in the nordoctor .
Mayahuash , some of you heard about the ayahuash , the most powerful psychotive substance .
What makes it fascinating the ayahuasca is not the potential to be the macological potential of the substance , but his processing . It 's how to two elements .
On one side , this laps that has a series of beta-carboline , harmolines and harmolines , harmolines , slightly hallucinogenic .
And then I take the only plants , you have a bluster that altery a little bit of conscious conscious , but it 's a mychool of a coffee family , said Psychotridis said , Psychotria viridis .
This plants can contains powerful triptamine , very similar to serotonin , dimethoxyptamine-5 , methoxyptamine .
If you ever see the Yanomami you 'll pull on the nose that they make a different species , kind of anchchin , it 's contains methoxyptamine .
Tiring that poor is a little bit like being disappeared by a card of paper dipinbarre-eyes and landed on a sea of electricity . [ Risones not creates a distorsion of reality ; creates of reality .
I was often a lot of my professor , Richard Evan Shultes , the man who has taken the psychical era , with his discovery of the fungi from the fucinogenic fungi in the 1930s in Mexico .
And I think , I can 't be a tamine , you can 't tell these triptamines as an hucinated .
It 's possible to be allowed to only if you 're assume with other chemicals dened by the MAO .
Now , the beautiful carboline that are in this liana , and that 's in this lian lian lian inhibers of MAO , the same type of enjoyed . The question is spontaneous : in a flour of 80,000 species of plants , like these popular found two diogically not like these popular found two cities . It 's the way , they , they , they do biochemical version , which is sus the same way , they do ,
We use the great eupherror and the error , which can reveal infrufer .
But if you ask the Indians , they 'll tell us , " Put us . "
What does that mean ?
This tribes , the Cofan , has 17 varieties of ayahuass , which are narely in the forest , and that our eyes would reach in the forest .
If you ask them how they 're stopping their tassonomics will tell us , " I thought , " I thought , " I said , " No . "
The solution is : you take the 17 varieties in a full and each one will canve with a different .
With not this not to be graduate to Harvard , but it 's much more interesting to contact the stami .
Now , this is that the problem of us that are also the ones of us that have been painting in the popular of our real world , and in some way reducts , but somehow reducts to the margins of the story , and it 's over .
In fact , 300 years old , it 's not going to be reminded of his wars or innovations , but rather as the era that we were stopped and actively as the one was where we stopped and actively accepted or accepted , the destruction of the planet . Now the problem is not change .
All the cultures through the hundred centurial degree for new lifetime .
And the problem is not technology .
The Indians Sioux , they 're not stopped to be Sioux when they put up and received as the Americans have no stopped to be Americans when they put in the horse and calving .
It 's not the change or technology that threatening the integrity of the ethnosphere . It 's the power .
The last last fly fly .
And if you look at the world , you 'll find that these are not destinated cultures to disappear .
They 're living and dynamics and dynamics out of existence to exist identify that they go beyonic .
I know that you have to disboscreaming in the patria of Penan --
a people who have a popular nomapsian popular nomulti-the-waste , a popular that light-up to a generation ago , and now reduced to the servitus and prostitution on the reduced of the reports , where you can see the re-seems to be a half Borneo to Meridional Meridional Meridional Meridional Meridional Meridional Meridional Meridiond , and the soul lightweet ,
It 's going to be to fill the stock with the forest woods .
Or , the Yanomami , are the disease that have come with the discovery of gold .
If we move on on the mountains of Tibet , where I 'm doing a lot of research , you see the last last last flight flight .
As you know , genocide , the physical extinction of a popular , is conviction of a popular lifetion , but ethnocide , the destruction of a popular popular , not only is convicted , but even celebrated in certain environments , because it 's a part of the strategy part of the development .
And you can 't understand the suffering of Tibet until you 're in the beginning .
I 've been loved the 6,000 miles from Chengdu in Western China through Tibet , and and sought to Lhasa with a young colleague , but only came to Lhasa , I realized what 's behind the statistics we hear about .
6,000 sacres in powers and cenches .
1.2 million people killed by the military Revolution .
The father of this guy was ascriticized at the Panchen Lama .
which means that it was killed in the Chinese temple invasion .
Her he was sitting with Sua Santity during the diaspora that has brought the people in Nepal .
Her mother was impriated and his cold was to be rich .
It was brought to hidden in the age of two years , he was born condendoses under his gonna because he couldn 't live without him .
The sister , who did the same , it was put in reduced in reducation .
A day he inavailed a day , a coffignant , and , for this transgression , was put forced to the jobs for seven years .
Tibet 's pain can be unoveroveroveroveroveroveroveroverover-recently , but the recently is from tener present .
And then , all of them reduces a choice .
We want to live in the world in monothonia or want to acacover the world policy ?
The great anthropologist Margaret Mead , before he 's died that his biggest fear was that , in our way to go towards this view of the world , not only see the whole range of human imagination reduced to a limitated modal-thought , but one day you 're going to see from a sleep to a sleep , and as well as well as there were other possibilities .
And it 's umilliant to remember that our species is exist for 600,000 years .
The Neolitics Revolution , which has given us us us agriculture , which has been clearly to the seed of the skid , by creating the shaman with the probe of of the clines , and we talk about 10,000 years ago .
The modern world 's industrialized in has 300 years .
That given a story , it doesn 't suggest that we have the answers to all the challenges that we 're going to have to deal in the millennia to come .
When we have these cultures of the world is asked what it means to be human , they response to 10,000 different voices .
And it 's in these answers that we all have the chance of being what we are : a kind of conscious , that has to make all the popular , all the gardens and all the gardens can fire .
I took this picture on the northern extremity of Baffin island , when I went to hunt with whales with Inuit , and this man , Olaya , Olaya , Olaya , he told me the wonderful story of his grandfather .
The canadese government was not always gentle with the Inuit 's popular . And in the 1950s to stabilie our suprematic , we have them in coloned .
The grandfather of this man refuted to go .
The family , I tear her life , took him off all the guns , and all his attitude .
You have to know that Inuit doesn 't fly temit .
The packs were made of fishing sleep in the skin of cary-skin .
The grandfather of this man didn 't make it in the middle of this man did not , or by the library that was suffering .
It 's sgatted , it took off , it calculated the pantalone in the skin and defecated in their hand . When I did it , I got them up , they worked by creating a mobile .
It 's spring up on the point of this hap caccept and when it solid , solid a dog .
It took the dog and created a brillier , with the torck cases created a sleta , and he 's disappeared another dog and it 's disappeared on the banker , he 's cked up .
We want to talk about cavarself-popular . And this , in different ways , [ Applausi ] is the symble of resilience of the popular of the world .
In the aprile 1999 , the California government has reached to the total control of an area of the bigger territory of the bigger California and Texas mystery together .
It 's their new potet-kria . It 's called Nunavut .
It 's an independent territory . They 're going to be all the minerarie .
One of the splendication of how a natione-state can recognizes with his people .
And , to finish , I think it 's pretty obvious at the people who who were in these remote song of the planet , realizing that they 're not remote remote .
For somebody 's house .
They represent human imagination that respect human imagination to respect . And for all of us , the dreams of these children , as dreams of slowing ss , become part of the nuda geography .
And finally , we have National Geographic , we are convinced that politicians will never come to nothing .
We believe that the polemids --
[ Applausi ] are not persuasive , but we believe that stories can change the world , and maybe we 're the best institution to tell the stories of the world . Every month our website is to be 35 million visit visit lights .
156 countries transmitted our TV channel .
Our magazines are labs from millions of people .
Our work is to travel in the ethnosphere to bring our audience in places that are going to be absolutely clear how they have been able to see , and hopefully , abbracing the central reveal of the central anthropology : the world of exist and we have to find a life in a pluralist and multicultural world in a pluralist and multicultural world , pluralist and we have to find a life in a world of life in a pluralist and pluralist and we have to be able to get to get to get to get a
where all of the popular wisdom of all of the popular wisdom .
Thank you .
I 'm going to talk about some things that I 've written in this book that I hope you 've already heard and try to push some connections , in the case not notice them .
I 'd like to start with what I call the " dogma " officer "
The officer dogma of what ?
The officer of all the Western industrial society . The official dogma is : " If we want to massixth of our citizens . "
The reason is , on one side , in fact that freedom is in itself a value , is , ues , useful , essential for human beings .
On the other is that if we 're free , each of us can act to do it for their well-being , not no one that you can do with it .
The way to massive freedom is massive similar to massive freedom .
The more choices are the more of them , the more libed , and greater is their well-being .
This , I think , is so deeply radical in society that nobody would dream to put it in doubt .
And it 's also deeply radicated in our lives .
I 'll show you some of what progress has made possible possible .
This is my supermarket . It 's not particularly big .
I lost a simple note of the conditions for saving .
In my supermarket , there are 175 conditions , without content the 10 varieties of olive olive , and 12 aceters who you can buy a huge amount of conditions in the fispling circumstance that nobody of 175 ready to be ready to be your degrees .
That 's how the supermarket .
Then you go to the store of electronic to buy a stereo : you , CD lector , radio lector , radio , piaright , practice .
And in this single clueprint , there 's a great number of audio components .
We can make six million and a half of different combinations that there are in one store .
You have to admit that there 's lots of choice .
Other communications : the world of communications .
Once , when I was a kid , you could get all the wild telephone services , and that were fornites from mom Bell .
He had the phone , you didn 't buy it .
One consequence of that , by the other , was that the phone never stopped .
These days are gone .
Now we have almost ill-wildlife , especially between mobile phones .
Here 's the cell phones of the future .
My favorite is that in the middle , MP3 , cut out of nose , and foreign for me , bruln-up .
If you don 't have yet seen it in the store under house , you 're very well certain that will be coming .
And what 's the end happens is that people go into the stops and assume this question . And you know what the answer is , " No . "
It 's not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn 't do too much .
So , in other life that are much more important than the acquired , you know , the same thing is explosion of choices .
Assistence health care : no longer in the United States that you go to the doctor and say what you have to do .
And instead , you go to the doctor , and the doctor says , " OK , we could do A , or B , " has these benefits and these benefits . "
You say , " Dotc , what should I do I do ? "
And the doctor says , " You have these benefits and these benefits and you have these benefits and you have these benefits . "
" What do you want to do ? "
And you rebits : " Would you be me , what would you do ? "
And the doctor : " But I 'm not . "
The result we call it " mality " , " " " " " " " mality " , " expression that makes it look like .
But it 's actually not that a movement and responsibility to make decisions from somebody who knows something , which is the doctor , and almost certainly , it 's almost sick -- and almost certainly it 's not sick -- and so in the condition to make decisions of patient .
There 's a huge marketing of pharmaceutical products , direct to people like me and you , that if you think it 's not a sense , because we can 't buy them .
But if we can 't buy them , because you have a public to be ?
The answer is that they want to domorning , we call the doctor to ask them to be able to change the recipe .
Something that of this fundamental identity is a question of choice , as you see in this jytoes , " We don 't want to force kids . We 're going to ceat their sex time . " We don 't know , we have to invent .
And we can reinvent how many times you do it .
which means that every morning , you have to decide that kind of person wants to be .
I think it was a family and marriage , a time perspective , a common perspective , which was almost on one , that was that you were married to the most soon possible .
The only real choice was with who , not when , and that 's not what to do next .
Over , it 's really to play .
I teach them very smart students , and I do 20 percent of work than a time .
And not because they 're brilliant , not because they 're undiligent .
but why am I impensive , intent , intent , I mean , I should be able to do it now ? "
" Would I be married later ? " I have to think before or career ? "
They 're interrogative interrogative .
And they try to answer these questions , even if this implessly , even if this implesson and I don 't get a beautiful vote to my examples .
And they have to really do it . They 're important .
Now , the work : we are lucky , like Carl was , because technology allows us to work , every minute of the planet , except that from the Hotel Randolph .
I 'm talking about , there 's a angle , and I won 't tell anybody what the WiFi works .
I don 't tell you , because I want to use it .
What does this amazing freedom of choice that we have about work ? And that we have to decide , continually in every moment , if we have to work or not .
We can go to our son playing hot , with cell cell phone , the Blackberry in one other , and the news , and the news , typically , on the glask .
And even if they 're all spent , every minute we see our son finished , we 're also asking the game , we 're also asking this called ?
" Do I have to answer this email ? I have to habels this letter ? "
And even when the answer is " no , " no , " all of this makes the experience of your son , very different than what would be in other conditions .
So , anywhere we look , little , little , and big , things , and big , materials and lifestyle , life is a question of choices .
Once the world was this : There were some chance , but it was not a question of choice .
The world today looks like this : The dilemma is , " Is it a good thing , or negative ? "
The answer is Still .
We know , positive bull by-up , so I 'll talk about negative those .
All this choice , two effects of negative effects on people .
The first , the first paradoxically , is that it makes free paralysis .
With a lot of options between which choices to choose , it becomes very difficult to do it .
I offer an example : a conduct example : a conduct on volunteer pensist-pentising .
A colleague has had access to the On of the Get data , the giant society of source , with about a million clients in 2,000 different companies .
What she found is that for every 10 solutions that are offered in more , the percentage percentage , the percentage of a two-percent of a two percent .
With 50 offered source , there 's 10 percent in less than adhhesions than only five . Why ?
Because with 50 four-four-four-four-four-and-decide , and choice is remaining tomorrow .
And in tomorrow , and I asked the question , tomorrow , and of course , tomorrow , and of course , it 's never coming .
You know , it doesn 't mean that these old workers are going to be dogs because they 're not going to have enough money , it also wants to say that decision is so hostical that allow the funds of the job dators .
Not participating , they 're losing up to five thousand dollars per year from work , which would be very well-disposed to be .
So , the paralysis is a consequence of having too many choices .
And I think it makes the world that I make it .
" And to finish , for ethernity : ketchup , send or maion ? "
You 'd just take the right decision , if it 's for ethernity , right ?
You don 't want to choose the wrong bottom , and you 're not going to choose .
So this is the first effect . The second one is that even if we can get the paralysis and make a choice , we 're less result of how we would be done with less options as we would be done with less options to choose .
And that 's this for several reasons .
One of these is that with many conditions to choice , if you buy one , and it 's not perfect , it 's easy to imagine that you could have been better . And what 's happening is that it 's the alternative imaginated us to look at the choice , and the replace as a choice , and the re-in-flip reached the rest of the choice , and the re-fenfendefation of the choice , and the reached the respse of the reavailable .
even when it was a good decision .
More choices , you know , more dislie than you have any details that it 's unsationally insatives .
Also , there 's what economists call cost to expensive .
Dan Gilbert clear clear , like the value that we 're going to depend on things that we 're confronted .
Other , when there are many options , it 's easy to represent the feature of alternative , and be less respected and be less respected to the option that you have to be less respected .
Here 's an example . I schools with all of the one that I 'm not New York .
But that 's what you 'd probably think .
There 's this copy to Hamptons .
A lussian place of lyplace .
It 's all about splendida . It 's all about them .
Not nothing . But what he thinks is , " Well , , there 's Agoddess . "
" All my neighbors in Manhattan are off . "
" I could talk about them right in front of home . "
And it goes two weeks of assillated by the idea that 's losing -- every day -- the chance of parking where it wants .
The constockpile opportunity decrease for what we have , even when the choice was excellent .
And the more are the options that we have to look at , more , more the feature attractive feature to be opportunity .
Here 's another example .
This is telling us a lot of things .
It talks about living the time , and maybe to live slowly .
But the most important point is that anything you 're going to be to do , you 're down .
The things that we don 't choose to be a lot of attractive , that we can make less attractive what we do .
Third point : spiral growing of expectations .
I tried it on my skin buying a new jeans .
It almost almost always jeans .
Once the jeans were just like , you were bought and besty , were besty , were constantly coced , and they were a lot of times , they were going to be good .
So , I went to buy a couple of new when those old were gone , and said , " I need a jeans , this is my cut . "
And the committed to me , and the next slim , and easy , the fit , axed ? "
He wants to her to the cernier or buttons ? " Stonewashed , " or " acidwashed ? "
" Do you want to be layers ? "
" Wott them want to leahead ? Ble blah blah -- " Continuated to elencounter .
I was sbalorded , and after a little bit of I could say , " I want to say , " I want to say , " He had no idea what was , so for a time , I tried to all of maledites , and then I got to say , " I want to do jeans , and I had to be .
It was the massive . I had the whole choice .
But I was feeling worse .
Why ? I wrote a whole book to understand that .
The reason I was worse is that with all that choice is that with all that choice , the jeans had to be perfect .
I was all in the beginning , I had expectations . I didn 't expect anything that was one . But when there was 100 different steps , accidents , at least one would be perfect .
What I had been buy , but not perfect .
And then I had a choice to what I was trying to do with what I was trying to do was unsatisfied in the expectations .
The added added options in life not to people who have respect to be on the excellence of options .
And that will be less satisfaction , even when the results are good .
Nobody in the marketing world , he realized it .
Because if they knew , you would not know what I 'm talking about .
The truth looks more like this .
" He was better when he was worse . " The reason that was better when he was worst when he was worst when he was worst , was still possible to meet surprised .
Over , day , in the world we live in -- opulents , industrialized citizens with the expection of performing -- the massive that we can hope is that things are on the altitude of the expectations .
You never surprised you ever surprised , because your expectations , my expectations , they 're injant .
The secret of happiness -- what you 're going to be here -- is , " Baxy " Yes , you want . "
I mean -- little whistle moment -- which is really sorted and my wife is really wonderful .
I couldn 't have to do it , I didn 't get account .
But it 's not always a bad thing .
And finally , a consequence of buy a couple of jeans , when you have that jeans is that when you 're not satisfied , and ask you , " Why ? "
" Who is responsible ? " , the answer is clear .
The world is responsible . What could I do you ?
When there are hundreds of kinds of jeans , and you buy a unsatisfacing , and ask you who is responsible , is the responsible , is the clear , is the responsible you .
You could have done better .
With hundreds of varieties available , not excuses for insuccess .
So when people take decisions , even if the result is valid , they 're insatisfied and they 're damaged and they 're damn the herself .
In the last few years , the depression is exploded in industrialized world .
I think that a meaning factor -- not the only one , but important -- of this wave of depression is that people have deludents are too high .
And when they have to explain this situation , they think that colder is .
So the final result is that we 're in general , objectively , but we feel worse .
Let me remember .
This is the officer dogma , what we all take for good and it 's completely fake . It 's not true .
There 's no doubt that a little bit of choice is better than to have any good at it , but it doesn 't take a lot of choice is better than a little bit .
There 's a critical value , magical value . I don 't know what it is .
But I 'm sure we 've overcome by a piece of a piece of the level in which choices make our life .
Now , from political point of view -- I 've almost finished -- from political point of view , the pele is the following .
What allows this all this choice in industrial society is the material wealth .
There are many places in the world , and you know , and you know , where the problem is not that they have too much choice .
The problem is that they have too pop .
So the factory I 'm talking about is a malbeing extraordinary of modern , Western society .
And what it does depress and climbs , and climbs this is : Steve Levitt talked about how expensive and texture seats are unuseful . It 's a spreheres . It 's a spreherent of money .
I mean these choices , complicated and available , complicated and available , is not that they 're just unuseful .
They 're enciling to the dollar .
They 're going to be worse .
If a little bit of what we have in our society , it allows a choice was reversed in those where people have too few possibilities , it would not just their life to improve but our .
This is what economists call a paretian improvement improvement .
A redistribution of income redistribution for everybody -- not only to the poor -- because of this choice in excess that it is .
To conclude , " You can get everything you want " --
You , people of culture , you 'll think , " What does that fish ? "
" It 's obvious that you can 't make anything in a box of glass . "
" A castrated , a world that 's limited , a world 's limited --
and I 've interpret it like this , at the beginning .
But then , I realize , instead , I realized that that the fish knows the long .
Because the reality of the facts is that if you mand in frantume , so that " all of you can 't be the freedom . You get the paralysis .
If you break the cut in a way that everything is possible to decrease .
You know , you 're going to reduce the wells , and you reducing wells .
Everybody needs a sphere .
This is almost certainly too closely , maybe even for the fish , and certainly for us .
But the absence of some symbolic sphere is a recipe for infelity and , for a ruin .
Thank you very much .
