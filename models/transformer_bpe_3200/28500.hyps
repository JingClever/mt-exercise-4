I showed these slides to show that the slide calculus to demonstrate that the artical calotter , which is about three million years had the size of 48 continental . It 's stretch for 40 percent .
But this underestimate the gravity of the problem because it doesn 't show the spending of ice .
The artical calotter is , in a sense , the clear heart of the global climate system .
You expanded up and you get to the summer .
The next slide will be a quick , is going to be a little bit about the last 25 years .
The glaces are signed in red .
You see , they 're expanded to the blue scall .
That 's the ice in winter , which is retreatment .
You can see that the so-called the ice peraent ice , of five years or more , is like blood , which is like blood , which is here from the body .
In 25 years , it 's past that .
This is a problem because warming is the heat interest , which is the glacier around the ocean where there are huge amounts of carbon congelated that , leaving , they 're transformed in metmetmeter from the microbes .
I think about the totality of the totality of global warming , that could double , that could double , overcome this point of not return .
In some deep deep profound in Alaska the meter is already rebling from water .
The professor Katey Walter of Alaska 's tiny , I got a team in a team of a fast last winter .
Video : Wow ! Al Gore : Wow ! Have 's good . The question is if we 're also going to be .
A reason is that the termal exchange Groenland from the northermal .
This is a glacial regime .
The brought had never reached levels like .
This is the Kangerlussuaq , in the Swest West of Groenland .
If you want to know how to be the sea level for the ice of the glace-leaving packs , and here is where the sea .
These running out of the current .
At the other hand of the planet : Antarctica , the biggest block of the planet .
The last month of scientists have dichieve that the ice of ice is in the negative , and that the Western Antarctica , which is particularly quickly , is particularly quickly , it 's particularly quickly in the month of the month .
It 's six feet to six feet of the bottom , like Groenland .
Sulla Himalaya , the third biggest block of ice , you see new laghi , which is a few years ago .
40 percent of the population of the world population half of the water from that the monstrate .
Sulle Ande : this glacier is the source of the water source of this city .
The brought is increased .
But when they 're decreasing , the same happens to the water .
In California , the newnow on Sierra Nevada is decreasing 40 percent .
The idricuum are in the crime .
The predictions , like you 're sitting , you 're great .
The growth saft to a remarkable of inceness .
The environmental disaster disaster , on a rithythm outside the normal and without precedented .
Four times more numheroes in the last 30 years , I precedented 75 .
This is a whole unsustainable andscape .
If you look in the context of the historical consequences .
In the last five years we 've added 70 million tons of CO2 every 24 hours -- 25 million tons of tons in the ocean every day .
Look at the Eastern area of the Eastern Pacific , the west of the Indian subcontinent , where there 's a radical imor oxygen in the ocean .
The major cause of global warming , together to deforestation , which is the fossil fuel use of fossil fuel .
Of the oil is a problem , and the carbon is even worse .
The United States is one of two countries with more emissions , together to China .
And it was proposing to build a lot of other cents .
But we 're seeing a direction of a direction of the direction .
These are the anullated proposes in the last few years and some green alternative alternative proposes .
Anyway , there 's a political load in our country .
The carbon industry and oil industry have spent 250 million dollars in the last year to promote carbon , which is a oxymous oxide .
And that image remembered me something --
Verice , in Tennessee , where I live , there was a 3.8 billion light-lighting lifeters of carbon flour .
Maybe you saw it on news .
This is the biggest second flow of last last in America .
It happened around Natal .
The publicity of one of the carbon industry was this .
Video : Swear .
It 's abundant here in America , and grow our economy .
Froy carbon is more and clean .
It 's good price , adorable and the work is keep the pend .
Al Gore : From here is a lot of the West Virginia .
The biggest mineral society on the mountains is Massey Coal . This is his administrator .
Video : Don Blankenship : Sarly , Al Gore , Nancy Pelosy Pelosy-Re-- -- they don 't know what they 're talking about .
Al Gore : So the Alleance for the Clima Protext has two campaign .
This is one of them , one part .
Video : Acore : Acore : Acy , we see the climate change as a sery of climate change as a sery t-to-in business .
So , our priority is to invest a lot of money in a commercial effort to make public and make public and confused the truth of the real real .
In fact , carbon is not sporite .
We think it 's clean -- it 's also a good profum .
So , not preocups of climate change .
Let me do it to us .
Video : Carbone : Carbone -- you 've heard a lot of it .
So let 's take a turn into a structure to the avange of the horders of the puly-light-up .
Straordinary ! The machines are a little rainal , but this is the sound of the pullight-carbon technology .
The carbon consumption consumption is between the main cause , but the remarkable technology that you see changing everything .
You look at a look : this is the hodieral technology .
Al Gore : Finally , the positive alternative , the positive , the national security issue and the national safety .
Video : Comment : The economy , the national security , national security crisis .
The truly that connected all : our dependence from fossil fuel , like the sporite of fossil fuon the maker and oil .
Now , there 's a new , audace , audace solution to use it .
Repowerful : 100 percent of clean energy , in 10 years .
A plan to put America to work , make us sure more , and help us surance the global warming .
Finally , a solution that is to solve our problems .
Repower . You 're more .
Al Gore : This is the last .
Video : How to report energy to America .
One of the fastest ways to bring the dependence from the combustible that killing our planet .
Compars : The future is here . Vind , a new energy network .
Compars number two : Nuovi investment for a very well retribes .
Comment : Repower America . It 's time to be realists .
Al Gore : A old proverbio African , says , " If you want to go fast , you go to fast .
If you want to go away , you go together . "
We have to go away , quickly .
Thank you very much .
Last year at TED , I introduction at TED , I introduction .
And promise to turn to turn to update about how the machine works .
So here I 'm here . And for the other time , the other time , the LHC is the biggest scientific experiment ever -- 27 kilometers of circles .
His task is to rerefiling the conditions that were present less than a billion of the universe -- until 600 million times a second .
All of that is just ambictious .
This is the machine below Ginevra .
We 're going to take these little Big Bang in the detectors .
This is what I work . It 's called ATLAS -- is 44 meters and has a damer of 22 meters .
This is a spectacular picture of ATLAS in building so you can see the proportions .
To10 to writing last year we got the machine for the first time .
And this picture was taken by ATLAS .
It was because of immense festeggiving in control .
It 's a picture of the first particles that had done all the time of the LHC , entering in collision , in the LHC , and spread particles in the detector .
In other words , when we see that image 10 writing , we realized that machine was a big writory .
I don 't know if it was this to exultate more or this , when somebody went on on Google and saw the page was this .
That means that we had a cultural impact beyond of the scientific impact .
About a week later , there was a problem with the car , right here -- these sleeping block here -- these sleeping blocks .
These things are going to 3,000 amping when the machine works at the massive power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the massive power .
Now , technical technical between you , and they 'll say , " It 's not true . I 'm sweet . "
And they can do it because when they 're very cox-called the superconflict of the superconstruction .
So , at least 271 degrees , at least a stick temperature in the space between stars , these things can bring that running that runs .
In one of the juntures of the most novehicle of the magneti magneti in the LHC , there was a defect of fit .
So the files are going to get a slightly , and the 13,000 hold , they had a suddenly met a electrical resistance .
This was the result .
Now , this is more impressed if you think that these magnetes more than 20 tons , and that you 've been moving about 30 centimeters .
They were damaged about 50 magnets .
We had to take them , what we did .
We restinated them and enabled them .
Now they 're now going to come back to their place underground .
By the end of the march the LHC is will be again .
We 're going to accept , and we expect it to the data or slude , and continue so our adventure to find out what I 'm in the morning that the universe .
Now , of course , in a way , these accidents reaccent the debate of the science and the engineering of the value of science and engineering the value of the world 's science and engineering in the front of the world 's science and engineering in the front of the value of science and engineering in the front of the value of science and the engineering in the front of the value of science and the engineering in the front of the value of science and the engineering in the front of science and the engineering of the front of the worldwide of science and the engineering .
I think the fact that it 's so hard , the fact that I think that 's the value of things like LHC .
I want to end with the words of a English scientist , Humphrey Davy , which , I imagine , in defense of unuseful experiments of his pupille , his pupille was Michael Faraday , said , " Nist so much for the progress of the human mind how riting that the science science is definitive to the progress of the human mind as the rups of the mind as the ritory of the human mind as the mind that is not a new way that the remainly we 're not a conquirt . "
Thank you .
I want to start to ask you to rethink of when , as children , as you 're doing coin the morning .
While you can see how to reach them and make them , take them and move them , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you can be able to think and solve problems .
The space reasoning is deeply connected to the way we understand a lot of the world around us .
So , from the atical usulity of our interaction with physical objects , together to my consulent Paint , and my collaborator Jeevan Kalanithi , I started to ask , " And if we use a computer , instead of having the only cursor of the mouse like polepastrer that stars a desktop , we could suddenly affect an information with your hands , we could make sure that spring both hands ,
and how to do it ?
The question was so interesting that we decided to explore the answer , building the Siftable .
In a few words , a Siftable computer is a great computer interactive .
In a few words , a Siftable computer is a great computer interactive .
You can move with the hand , they can " see " between them , " and they can hear their motion and have a screen and a radio wireless .
But most importantly , they 're physical objects , like the morning , you can actually move it to be made .
The Siftable is the example of a new ecosystem of tools to manipulate digital information .
And as they become more physical , consciousness of the motion of the other , and as they become more physical , of the other , of how we can move them , we can explore new things .
I 'm going to start with some simple example .
This Siftable is configured to show the video : if you 're in a direction , video rowine , the video will rotable , video like this , if you 're going to stop the other side .
These interactive rits are aware of of the other .
If I ran them , they 're interested in what they 're around .
If they 're surrounded , they can see it and they can do a little bit .
If they 're surrounded , they can see it and they can do a little bit .
They also have their motion and inclination .
We then realized that one of the interesting implications of the interaction was to use the common management , for example , " a color like , " a color like it was a liquid .
In this case , we have three Siftable to configurate them as a buch and I can use them to fix the color , where they mix .
and I can use them to fix the color in that central , where they 're missing .
We can be too , we can put a little bit a place .
There are also beautiful possibility of learning , like language , the mathethematics and logical games where people can try to do things quickly , and see the results of the results immediately .
I 'm --
This is a Fibonaccount that I do with a program of equations .
Here we have a words game in the midst of the words of Scarabeo and Boble .
Pratically , at every turnal , you get a letter , at every Siftable , Pratically , at every turnal , you get a letter to any of Siftable in Siftable , and while you 're looking at the words .
Then , after about 30 seconds they remix , and you have a new leck set of reading and new possibilities to try .
Thank you .
Here 's the children came to the Media Lab , I did , I did this so I tried them and I went to a video .
They 're like a lot of them .
And one of the interesting things like this kind of appliance is that you don 't have to give people a lot of instructions .
You 've got to say , " Compons of words , and they know exactly what to do .
Here 's what other people try .
This is our youngest tester tester , there on the right .
It actually wanted to impilt them .
They only were morning in him .
Now , this is a appliation of a interactive cardboard .
We wanted to build a tool for the apprenticing language is Felix .
It can put new characters in the scene , lifting the Siftable to them .
It can put new characters in the scene , lifting the Siftable to them .
So , it 's going to get out the sun .
Video : The sun is smile .
David Merrill : Now , it took a herest .
Video : The hang trewer .
Bel ! Yeah ! Yeah !
So by the Siftable and put them close to the character .
Video : Bau !
-- by inventing your story .
Video : Hi !
DM : It 's a story with the open , and it can decide him like it 's going to .
DM : It 's a story with the open , and it can decide him like it 's going to .
Video : From , thin .
DM : The last example I have time to show you is a tool , which is a recently recently , to sample and execececectum .
It 's a tool , recently recently , to tramp and exeguing music .
The Siftable here , the bass and the battery .
Every one of these has four different variations , and you can choose what to use .
You can also enjoyed these sound in a sequence to you get your pleasure .
And I just like to share a sound of a sound and a sequence .
These are actually actually that you can control from the live , like the reverber and the filter .
You 're going to take it to a particular sound and then fixing it .
And then there are the general effects as time and volume , which is going to be in sequence .
Let 's look like .
Video : We 're going to be able to do a bottom in two Siftable sequence , we put them in a series , we put it in one series , we add the other basic basic .
Now I put a bottom line .
Video : I add of the sense of the --
Video : I 'll put the filter to the battery , so I can control the effect from the live .
Video : I can be fast the whole sequence of the time from one side or another .
Video : I 'm going to add the bottom of the bottom to give more expression .
Video : I can recombine the sequence " to flight the flight . "
So I don 't have to plan it first , but I can improvise , making it longer or the corner .
And now , finally I can spend the whole sequence of the left the Siftable . The Be " volume " volume . "
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is to build new mo-up interfacts and more soembers how our brain work and body .
And today , I had time to show you one of the results of this path , and also some chance we 're trying to take out of the lab .
The concept I want to transmit is that 's coming this new generation of designed objects to interact with digital media , that will bring information in our world in the way that we want .
Thank you very much .
I don 't see the time to talk to you all .
I 'm a writer .
I 'm going to criter is my profession , but it 's more of this , of course .
It 's also love and the fashion and my life .
And I don 't expect that it can change .
But , said , something particular , something happened to my life and my career , which has brought me to get the whole relationship with this work .
The particular thing is I recently written this book , this whenever called Mangia , Prega , Ama , " Ama , " Ama , diversof of my books , for some reason came out in the world and became a big , , bestseller , interational , and the interational , and the interational ,
And the result is that wherever you get me to be like I was convicted .
It 's true -- convicted , convicted .
They 're all about me and I 'm going to do all worried and say , " You don 't know to do better ?
You don 't care to continue to write for all life , without being able to create a book that can important somebody ? "
that can be important to somebody ? "
It 's surance , you know .
But it could go worse , on the one I remember that over 20 years ago , when I started to say to people -- I was a writing -- I wanted to be a writer .
I 'd meet to the same reaction based on the fear .
And people said , " Don 't I couldn 't success ?
You don 't care that the humiliation of the reflecting you ?
You don 't care to do this window for all life , without anything about it ever comes and die of a sand-a-dream of a hand-dream of a bunch of hand-a-shy . "
So , you know .
The answer -- the short answer to all these questions is , " Yes . "
Yeah , I 'm afraid of all of these things .
I 've always had fear .
And I also have a lot of other things that people can 't have to inform .
Like the algae and other spent things .
But , as much about the write what I thought and I would say , and I would say , " Why ?
Is it rational ?
It 's logical that anyone who has to wait to be spended by a job that you 've been born to do .
But what 's so particular in the businesses that we have a nervous health care of the mental health care of the mental health care of a way that other career don 't do ?
Like my father , for example , he was a chemical engineer and I don 't remember one time in his 40 years of activity that was asked if he was hearing it to be able to be able to engineer ?
There was never -- that block of engineer John , how do it go ?
It didn 't work so much , you know ?
Onestly , chemical engineers like group have no matter , in the centuries , waradagnated the reputation of being alcoiled maniacated to be alcolized .
We have a writers , we have enough this reputation , and not only writers , but creativity of any kind of a reputation of this reputation of being enormous .
And it 's not something else that look at the sad of the deaths of creative magnificments that , only in the 21st century , they die young people and often died young people and often died young people .
And the ones that are not suiciddenly seem to be really disfacing from their dones .
Nman Mailer , first of death , in the last interview said , " Every my book killed me a little more " an extraordinary affermation about the work of its life .
But we don 't get the board , when we heard this very long things that in some way we 've completely interiorized and accepted the notion that creativity and the notion that creativity and suffering is in some way that the art , at the end , will containing the writing of the wildlife .
And the question I want to take to everyone here is : you agree with this idea ?
You know , this thing -- because also looking at it from a centimeter of distance to me , it 's not good for this supposition .
I think it 's odious .
And I think it 's dangerous and I don 't want to see the perpetuated in the next century .
I think it 's better encouraging our big creative minds .
And I suck , in my case -- in my case -- in my situation -- it would be very dangerous to start to sleeping the circumstances I 'm in my career .
It 's very -- I 'm really -- you look at , I 'm pretty young , I have about 40 years .
I 've got about four worldwide .
And it 's very likely that whatever I 'm going to be right from the world like the work that came out of my last book .
I 'm going to be slavery , because we 're all more of friends here -- is likely that my biggest success is my shake .
Oh , Gesus , who thought !
You know this is the kind of thought that leads a person to start to drink in the nine of the morning and I don 't want to do it .
I would take this work that we 're going to do this work that we 're .
So , the question gets , how ?
And so , it looks , after a lot of reflecting , which the way to continue to write is to create a psychological construction , right ?
I have to find a safety distance between me , which I 'm writing , and my natural anxial anxial rate of what the written will written for all last year , trying to find other society , trying to find other society to see if they could have better ideas and see if they could have better ideas and see if they could have better ideas , and see if they could have better ideas , and see if they could have have better ideas and sane ideas ,
about how to help people creative results to deal the emotional risks of creativity .
And that research took me to the old Grek and an old Grek and an old Rome .
I 'm going to go to circle and then back .
In the ancient Grek and old Rome -- people didn 't seem to believe that creativity came from men , OK ?
It was thought that creativity was this spirit , they 're looking at the men from some source distant and unknown , for reasons , for distant reasons and unknown for reasons .
The Great were called these spiritual divine demon .
Socrate , wonderful , he believed to have a elareas that was remote wisdom from far far away .
The Rooms were the same idea , but they were called the the spirit of a genius .
which is great , because the Rohands were not really thought that a genius was somebody particularly smart .
They thought that a genius was this kind of divine , which was literally living in the walls of a study of a past , a little bit like the elpho Dobby , and that came out of the art of the artist and models the result of the artist and modeling the result of the artist and modeling the result of that work .
Except -- here is , that 's the distance of which I talk about -- that psychological construction that you protected you from your work .
And they all knew that was how it worked , right ?
So the anti-artists were protected to things , like for example , too much of the too much narcible , right ?
If your work was exceited , you couldn 't take all the place , all of you know that you were helped by this incorporate genius .
If your work failed , it wasn 't your whole , right ?
Everybody knew that was your genius to be a inable .
And so people han conceived creativity in the West for a long time .
Then the Renciment came and everything changed , and they were all this big idea ; we put the human center of the universe over the universe of the universe and the mysteries and without leaving space creatures that writing the writing writing of the winity .
This was the principle of humanity , and people started thinking about creativity , and people started thinking about creativity , completely from the hydden .
And for the first time in history , you start to refer to this or artist as a genius , like a person who 's a person with genius .
And I have to tell you , I think it was a big big mistake .
I think that allow somebody , a simple person to believe that that they 're like a recipient like the source , the essence and the source of all the mysteries , creativity , unknowable and inknowable and a lot of the human truly .
It 's like to ask somebody to enjoy the sun .
It 's deforming and destrot the ego and creates all these ingestishes expectations .
And I think it was this pressure that I 've been destroyed in 500 years .
And , if this is true , and I think that is , the question becomes , and now ?
Can we do that ?
Maybe I 'll go back to a more old comprehension of the relationship between humans and creative mystery .
Or perhaps not .
Maybe we can 't docell 500 years of rational thinking in a 18 minutes .
And there 's probably people between the audience that would read the scientific sospects on the notion of the notion of , you know , you know , they follow the next people , they 're doing the next projects .
I 'm going to not convinced you all about this thing .
But the question I 'd like to bring is -- why not ?
Why don 't it think that way ?
Because it 's more sense of everything that ever heard of the exabsolutely existing exaspering imprevedibility .
A process that , as anyone who ever tried to do something -- so , everybody 's here -- you know , you 're not compored .
And , in fact , it can sometimes sometimes it 's all like paranormal .
I did this meeting with the extraordinary poetry Ruth Stone , who has now 90 years , but it 's been a poeter for all life and said that during her infant in the rural Virginia , worked out out in the camps , and he felt out in if a poetry , when a poeter came from the landscreen .
He said that was like a frageous train of air .
And that was reaching to her to her from the landscape .
He felt that , because he was to tremendous , because he was to tremendous .
He knew I had one thing to do to that point and was of , her , her running like a match . "
And so he would correct to the home and come from this poem , and it wouldn 't have to make a piece of paper and a match of paper and a match of a little bit of fast , and the mistake it , collecting it and make it on the page .
Or three times he couldn 't be fast enough , so he would correcve and the correcve without to get to the home and the poem , and the poetry , and he would continue to rot through the landscape , looking , and she would continue to the rot , looking , as she said , " another poet . "
Then there were those times -- this piece of time , I never forget the -- there were moments where he was almost losing , right ?
So , he was running home and was trying to the card and the poem was going through , and then he was a match in the way that was going , and then said , which was like if you fall the way to the other hand and the steffing .
He cutting the poem from and remain her body and transced it in his body and transcracked it .
And in these cases , the poem would be presented on the perfect page and the contrast , from the last word to the first .
So when I heard the thought -- it 's crazy , it 's exactly the same thing for my creative process .
Not all my creative process -- they 're not a construct !
I 'm a mulo , and my way to work is ; I 'm going to wake up in the same orary every day and work and go to the goffly .
But even I have a waste , I 've been stripped to that thing , sometimes .
And I imagine that many of you have the han .
You know , even if the work and ideas were to me from a certain source , you can 't honestly know .
And what is this thing ?
And how can we relate to it in a way that we don 't lose your head , but rather , what do we do to stand healthy ?
I mean , the best contemporary example I have is the Mayer Tom Waits , which I 've interviewed different years ago for a newspaper .
We were talking about this , and you know , Tom , for the majority of life is the incarnation of the artist town , trying to control , to deal , to control , to dominate these species of impulses .
But then he invent , he calculus , and one day while he was driving on a highway in Los Angeles , changed everything for him .
He was going to be fast and fall of a sent tract of this little melody fragment , which comes in in his head as the inspiration , and the wants , and the well-fresh , and the desider , but it 's not about how to take it .
It 's not a piece of paper , it has no cycle , it has no regier .
So it starts to feel this kind of old anximium growing in him , " I 'm going to lose , and I 'm going to lose , and I 'm going to lose .
I 'm not good enough and I can 't do it . "
And instead of going to the panic , they stop .
He was the whole process of mental process and made something completely new .
I just just just the sky and said , " Scause , I 'm not driving ? "
" Do you look like a song now ?
If you really want to be there , you go to a more opport when I can take care of you .
Otherwise , you 're going to be able to importantly somebody else today .
I 'm going to disturbing Leonard Cohen . "
And his work process changed after this .
Not the work , the work was still dark .
But the process , and the fish anximid-handed it was releft when the genius was remained when the genius was that he would take it back to where the problem was , and I 'm going to get it back from where it was , by doing that it was , and I 'm going to get it back from where it was , and I was remained and remaining it .
but you can 't have this peculiar , wonderful bizarre collaboration between Tom and this strange and outside of Tom and this strange and outside that was not Tom .
So , how I felt that story , so that that story to change a little bit of the way I worked and already save me a time .
This idea , I was saved when I was writing " Mandia , Prega , and falls in one of those dispersed dispersation where we 're all working on something and we can 't do and you start to think that will be a disaster , which is going to be the worst book book .
Not just bad , right , right the worst book written .
And I started thinking about this project .
But then I remembered Tom I was talking to the air and I tried to us .
So I went up to my face on the swill-slasts and I was made of a vacuum of the room .
And I said to a high voices , " Sests , what we know , you 're going to know that if this book is not going to be a brilliant , no ?
Because as I see you 're going to do with all I have , no longer than that I have , I don 't have any more of this .
So if you want to be better , you have to present you and do your part .
OK . But if you don 't do that , you know what , I don 't do that .
I 'm going to write the same because it 's my work .
And I 'd like to do for that I 've been shown to do my part of " Because -- at the end is so , OK -- in the end , OK -- -- in the deserts of the North Africa people were unratch for the moon , and music that would go on to the moon , and the music that went on to the daba .
And they were always magnifically , because the baller-professionals were and fantastic .
But every so , rarely , something happened , and one of these artists became transcending .
And I know you know what I 'm talking about , because I know you all , at some point , a performance so .
It was like the time you stopped , and the dance walked through a kind of land-up and not doing anything different from the usual , like 1,000 night , but everything was going on .
And suddenly , not appearing as a human .
But it 's accending from the divinity of divinity .
And when this happened , in the time , people knew what was , they called him .
They would count your hands and start to cantate , " Allah , Allah , God , " God , " . "
That 's God , you know .
Women note -- when the Mororal Morr. invases this habitude with them and the pronunced that I was in the centuries from " Allah , Allah , Allah , " Ole , Allah , " Ole , " Ole , " , " Ole , " Ole , " Ole , " which is , " Ole .
In Spain , when a artist did something impossible and magic , " Allah , the , the , Allah , By , I was , " ununderstanding , " incomprehensive , there -- a last of God .
And it 's great because we need .
But , the problem comes the day after , for the dances , when you wake up and discovering that are 11 in the morning of Martedesday and finding the last day of God is no longer .
It 's just a mortal of a bad bad in the ginock , and perhaps it never will ever ever ever get to the end .
And perhaps nobody will you have the name of God , and what does it have to do with the rest of his life ?
It 's hard .
This is one of the most painful recogniliations to make in a creative life .
But perhaps it doesn 't have to be so much if you can 't believe , in the mostly extraordinary aspects of your being come from yourself .
But you know , just that you 're being data in prested by a inimaginable source of this team of life that you have to go to somebody else when you finished .
And , you know , if we think that it 's all changes .
And so I started thinking about it , and it 's surely as I thought about this for different months of the book that I 'm going to do , the dangerous , attesissued , waiting , waiting , attesissued , I 've been followed to think of my success .
And what I 'm going to continue to tell me when I feel elevated from this is , not afraid .
It 's not just your work . It 's just your work .
It 's presenting to you for your part , any can be .
If your work is dancing , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know ,
If the divine , absurd genius to take a few kinds of wonderful , for one of wonderful , for one moment through your effort , then " Ole you go . "
Otherwise , you 're doing the same dance .
And " Ole ! " to yourself .
I think , and I should be taught to teach it .
" Ole ! " to you get the same , even for being a human and testing tarts to make you continue .
Thank you .
Thank you .
June Cohen : Ole !
As you know , I 've already talked about some of these projects on the human genome , what can mean and the discovery of the new genome .
Now we 're starting a new path : we started to digitize biology and now starting from that digital code we 're in a new biology of biology , designing and winter and synthesizing life .
We always tried to ask a big questions .
What is the life ? " is something that many biologists have been trying to understand slevels of free .
We tried different approaches , reduced it to the minims .
We 're digitizens from almost 20 years .
When we sequenced the human genome was to spend from the analogical world of the digital world .
Now we ask us : can regenerate life , or create new life from this digital universe ?
This is the map of a small organism , Mycoplasma genitalium , which is the smallest genome between the small genome of the lab .
And we tried to reduce ulteriorly genome to create a little bit more .
We can eliminate a hundred genes of a hundred genes of about 500 that are here .
But when we look at the metabolic map , it 's relatively simple than our .
I believe me , this is simple .
But when we look at all the genes that we can eliminate , one at the time , it 's very unlikely that this can bring a living cells .
So we decided that the only way to progrede was synthesize this chromosome , so that that could be able to modify some of these fundamental questions .
And so we started the adventure of " Can we can synthesize a chromosome ? "
Can it conhear that chemical to make these big molecules that we never could create these big molecules that we never could create before ?
And , in case , we can make a chromosome ?
A chromosome is just a piece of inert material chemical material .
The speed with which we can digitize life is growing to be growing up to exponential .
Our ability to write the genetic code , instead , proproproproproproproproproproproproposing , but it 's improving .
And our most recent results the results of exponential curve .
We started over 15 years ago .
The process required many passages , starting with a bioethical revision , first experiments we begin .
But we found that synthesize DNA is very difficult .
There are tens of thousands of machines in the world that produce small segments of DNA , long , long , the long-flies of 30 to 50 letters , and it 's a degenerative process : the most mistakes are there .
So we had to develop a new method to assemble these fragments and correct the mistakes .
And this was our first attempt , starting from the digital genome of the Phi X-74 .
It 's a little virus that kills bacteria .
We designed the fragments , effective the rition of the mistakes and get a DNA molecule molecule .
The interesting part is when we took this piece of chemical material , inert material , and we put it in the bacteria , the bacteria have started reading this genetic code and produring the viral particles .
The viral particles have been released by the cells , they went back and they destroyed the E.
I talked about recently with the oil industry industry is saying that they 're certainly understanding this model .
They have reverse more than you .
We believe that this is a situation where software can really build the same hardware in a biological system .
But we wanted to do things in big big .
We wanted to build the whole chromosome of the bacteria .
They 're over 580 miles of genetic code .
So we thought we could build it in the cassets of the virus , so that we can change the cassets to understand what are the components of a living cells .
The design is crucial , and if we start with digital information in a computer , these are to be very accurate .
When we sequenced this genome for the first time in 1995 , the standard accurataccount was a mistake for every 10 miles .
We found it , we were resequenced , 30 mistakes . If we had that original sequence we never would have been able to do it work .
One part of the process is designing over 50 letters that are spring with all the other segments of 50 letters to build subunits of smaller than they 're working together .
We try to the only element here .
You probably read that we 're going to read that we 're in the fixing .
Think about this : we have a based on four letters : A , C , Gs and T.
Three of those letters put together with about 20 adminoacids , and there 's a specific order to read for every friend .
So we can use the genetic code to write words , sentences , thoughts .
What we did at the beginning was autographed to do it .
Some have been dollar that wasn 't poetry .
We designed these segments to just one with them to just unning them .
There are some that they repair them and put them up .
And we started assembling from parts , starting with segments from five to seven mile , unending them up to a few of 24 thousand leck , units at them sometimes to get to 72 mile .
So , we 've produced these segments in abundance so that we can sequenced them from that we 're trying to create an extremely robustoke -- as you see in a minute .
We 're trying to automatize the process .
So , this looks like the tabellon of a basket player .
When we get these very long , over 100 miles , more than 100 miles , they 're not going to grow more directly in E.
It 's to the limit of modern biology molecular biology .
So we looked at other mechanisms .
We knew about another mechanism called recombination omologist , which is useful , in biology is urial to repair the DNA to joof the DNA .
Here 's an example .
This organism , called Deinococcus radioococcus radiation .
You can see in the sudden square like his chromosome , you can see it destroyed .
In 12 -- 24 hours , it 's replaced as it was before .
There are thousands of organisms that they can do it .
These organisms can sit completely .
They can live under a vacuum .
I 'm absolutely that life existing in space , and you feel to find new rich of water .
ASA showed it that this is .
This is a picture of the molecule we built using these processes , just using the lifetime with the appropriate design of segments .
The light-assemble leaf them .
This image was not taken with a microscope with a microscope , but with a microscope .
It 's a molecule that we can see it with a light microscope .
These are phophotos that are doing a time of about six seconds .
This is the advertising that we 've done a little time .
They 're over 580,000 letters of genetic code .
It 's the biggest molecule of a defined structure from man .
It 's got a 300 molecular molecular weight .
If you stamp it with a 10 and waste and a 10 and wish , it would like 142 pages only to transclaw this genetic code .
Now , how do we do it work ? How can we activate it ?
Of course , you 're traging a virus is a game of kids .
It 's a little bit more complicated when you use bacteria .
It 's simpler , even when it 's about eucariote like our : you can just extract nucleo and put another one , which is basically the process of cloning process .
In the archaea battery the chromosome is integrated inside the cells , but we 've showed that we 're able to do a complete little chromosome of chromosome from one cell , to another and to activate it .
We clear a chromosome from a microbial of a microbial .
The two are different as men from the mopes .
We 've added some genes more in a way that you can decide what to this chroromosome .
And then , I 'm skied with the enzymes , to kill all the proteins .
And when we put it in the cells was stupendoctor -- and you 'll appreciate our sophisticatoo-- the new chromosome -- the new chromosome was going into the cells .
And we started thinking that we couldn 't go beyond , but we tried to spush us over there .
This is one of the major mechanisms of evolution .
We found that a lot of old species have added one second or a third chromosome , added in a second thousand new tracts of the one second thousand of new traits to that species .
So who think about evolution as a only gene , the only one time that has not understand a lot of of biology .
They 're like the enzyme called restrition restrition , which I think of the DNA .
The chromosome that was in the cells , it 's not one .
The cell phone the chromosome that we put it down --
It 's expressed , and recognized the other as expressed material , the block material , and has masticated it , and we 've just recognized with only the cell and the new chromosome .
It became blue because of the genes we put .
And in a short leverage of time , all the characteristics of a species are gone allowed , and it turned around in a new species , based on the new software that we 've put in the cells .
All the protects have changed , the membranes have changed , and when we read the genetic code is exactly what we 've transferred to you .
Now , this may seem to look at genetic , but altering the software , we can change things things in a very , very , very , very , very , very , very , it could look like the genetic software , we can change things things in a very , very , very , very , very , very , very , one may seem like this , a little genetic altering .
Now , I 've already explained that there is not about genesesis -- but to go from three million years and a half million of evolution , and I said that maybe we 're going to create a new version of the Cambrian explosion where they 're going to create new species on this digital process .
Why do that ?
I think it 's pretty obvious when we think about our necessity .
We 're going to go from six billion and a half billion people in the next 40 years .
Right for example : I was born in 1946 .
Now there are three people on the planet for each of the planet for the 1946 .
We 're having problems now to find food , freshold and clean , medical and gas for six and a half billion people .
It 's going to be even more than that for nine billion .
We use more than five billion carbon diother-billion oil , more than 30 billion oil .
That means a hundred million barium per day .
When we try to find biologists , or any kind of process to replacing them , it will be a huge challenge .
We have to hold the whole of CO2 emission of all of CO2 from these materials that is in the atmosphere .
At day , thank you to the scientific discoveries all over the world , we have a database with about 20 million genes , and I like to think that are designed for the future .
The electronic industry , only only only only only one dozen of components , and think about how many different things are coming out .
Our limitations are mainly claunched by the imagination of our imagination .
Now we have a techniques , because of these rapid synthesization , in fact that we call a combinatory genomics .
We can build a big robot that can produce a million chromosomes a day .
Think about 20 million of genes , or to try to optimize the processes to produce eight or drugs , new vaccines , new vaccines , we can change , because of a small team , and create more biology now that in the last 20 years of science .
And it 's just a standard selection .
We can choose for a chance of survival , chemical production or carbon , production , vaccine vaccines .
This is an instant some software programs that we 're working for being able to seat us and design species to be able to seats us and design species to the computer .
Well , we don 't necessarily know how it will be .
We know exactly how their genetic code .
We 're now four-generation of quarter generation .
You also see you that extract thanol from the gran experiment that was a bad experiment .
We have a second and third generation of the second and third generation that are going to be soon in the higher of the higher value of the higher of the eight-different kinds of butanol .
But the only way that biology can have a big impact without increasing more the cost of food and limitarly , the cost of food and limitary the cost of the CO2 in matter before , so we 're working to design cells that can reach this purpose , and we think we can have the first reach this . And we think we 're being the first generation of the last fourth generation in about 18 months .
The solar light block with CO2 is a metodo-- but in our discoveries all over the world , we 've found different metods .
This is a organism we described in 1996 .
I live in the deep ocean , about 2,000 feet of the water temperature in the ebul-water temperature .
They create meter from CO2 , using hydrogen molecular hydrogen .
We 're trying to understand if we can endog CO2 , which can easily be transported through tubi , converting that CO2 in carbon , to drive this process .
So , short , we think we could be able to increase what the basic question of " What is the basic question of " What is . " We have the goal of replacement , we have the goal of replacing the oil industry .
Exactly . If you can 't do that from TED , where you can ?
It would be a main source of energy .
And also , we 're working to use the same metods to create instant vaccine .
You 've seen this year with flu , we 're always back to a year and with a dollar in less when it 's about to find the right vaccine .
I think that that can change fight vaccines in an anticipate vaccine .
So this future could start looking at , now , the tree of evolution , now , the tree of evolution , accelerating evolution with the synthetic bacteria .
We 're so on the improving people .
Our purpose is to make a long way of living enough to try to do it . Thank you very much .
First of all I 'm going to show you , the fastest possible , some fundamental work , the new technology that we 've taken Microsoft in the follow-year aquison . This is Seadragon .
It 's a environment where you can interact is to the local level that remote with a huge amount of visual data .
We 're seeing a lot of gigabyte digital photograph with a kind of zoom , and continuous , for a panoramic fast , and we have the images like we want .
And it doesn 't matter how big the amount of information that we see , how big these things are great things that we see , how big these things are the data or images .
Most of them are digital photographs , but this is a scan from the Library of Congress of Congress , and reenters in the rance of 300 megapile .
It doesn 't make any difference because the only thing that limits the prestations of a system like this is the number of pixel on your screen in any time . It 's also a very flexible architecture .
This is a book , example of data is not images .
This is the Casa desolated Casa .
So to show you that it 's just about the text and not images , we can do something like that , to see that it 's a real real representation of the text , not a picture .
It could be a little bit artificial to read a electronic book .
Not a reverse .
This is a more realistic example . It 's a number of the The Guardian .
Every image is the beginning of a sex .
And it gives you the pleasure of reading the real real cardddate version of a magazine or a newspaper or a newspaper , which is for a moltear ,
We also have done something with the angle of this particular number of the Lardian .
We created a higher advertising ads , and more higher than what you 're used in a normal advertising -- and we 've got extra content .
If you want to see the characteristics of this automobile , you can see here .
Or other models , or even the specific techniques .
And this really shows some of these ideas to eliminate the limits of space on the screen .
We hope that means that you can actually want to put a pop-up and other things like , they 're not necessarily necessarily .
Of course , the map is one of the most obvious applications for this kind of technology .
And I don 't want to lose time , if we don 't say we have contribute to give this in this field .
These are all the streets in the United States , there 's a NASA geospspace .
So , we 're going to go to something else .
This is actually now the live of the Web ; you can go to see it .
It 's a project called Photosynth , which combine two different technologies .
A is Snavely , and the other is a very interesting computer visual computer that was made by Noah Snavely , a student of Washington , with the aid of Steve Seitz of UW Szeliski Seitz Rick Szeliski of Microsoft Rick . Agki , Rearch . At collaboration . An n . " Agy-Desch . "
And it 's from the Web , managon from Seadragon .
You can see it when we do this kind of screen , where we can spend from one image to another and have this kind of experience of experience .
But the spacecraw of the images here has actually a meaning .
The computer algorithms of computers have been recorded these images together , so that they 're all linked to the real places that are all skepen in -- all of you 're showing up to the Rockie Montagne Rockies -- have been scatten . Here you see the elements of a slide , or imaging pan-to-hand-to-up , and these things have been all linked to the space .
I don 't know if I have time to show you some other environment .
There are a few more space .
I want to go directly to one of the original Noah-- and this comes from a preceder prototype of Photosynthoahsynthetic data that we 've done the first summer last summer , to show you what I think is really the key key is really the key key key to this technology , Photosynthrowing . And it 's not necessarily evident looking at the the environments .
We had to worry about legal aspects and forth .
This is a reconstruction of Notre Dame images from Flickr , you know , Nototre Dame , Flickr and you get images of the kind of shiring , other of the campus and on the campus and on the way , and on the way , and so on . Every one of these orange conants to this model .
So they 're all images from Flickr and they 're all connected to the space .
And it 's possible to be able to do this very simple way .
You know , I would never have thought to end for Microsoft .
It 's very gratifying receive this kind of academand .
I think you can see that it 's a lot of different kinds of fotowrote : from the ones of those cell phones in the SLR , a meaning number meaningful , put together in this environment .
And if I can , I try to try to look at those sleeping the most strange .
Many of them are faces by faces , etc .
Somewhere you find a series of photographs -- here .
This is a poster of Nototre Dame recorded correctly .
We can go from the poster to the physics of this environment .
The essential point is that we can do things with social environment . This is now taking data from the whole memory of how to apply the land is that we can do the Earth , from the visual point of view -- and connected to all those data together .
All those pictures become connected together , the major of the sum of the parts .
You have a model of the land that emerging .
Think about this as a prolungation of Stephen Lawler on Earth .
It 's something that grows in complexity , as people use it , and the advantages to who use it .
Their pictures are hushed with inseries of other people .
If to somebody comes the idea of contrast to each of these sants saying the name , my photographs of Notre Dame suddenly requires to be required to all those data , and I can use it as a point of enresult to the space , using the photographs of anyway else , and have a picture of them , and have a shelf experience , and a shelf , and a shelf .
Of course , a consequence of all of this are virtual models of every part of the land , collective of every other interesting part of the Earth , and that 's not just seen it , but from the memory imagery , but from the memory of the collective memory .
Thank you .
Chris Anderson : I realized what your software is going to take us to do is that to do is is that at some point , in the next few years , all the photographs share they going to be practical together ?
BAB : Yeah . What 's doing is basically , to find out .
It 's creating hyperlink , if you want , between images .
And it 's in the bottom of the images .
The thing is very interesting if you think about the rich information semantes that many of these images are possible .
As when you 're a research of images on the Web , you have a rase and the text on the web page has a lot of information about the images .
Now , what happens if that picture is you 're connected to all your pictures ?
So the amount of semantical interconnection and the amount of wealth that is really enormous . It 's a classic effect of the network .
CA : Blaise , it 's really incredible . Compliments .
BAA : I thank you very much .
One of the pleasure of the main of ethnographics of ethnographics is that we can live between who has not forgotten the antial traditions , between who have the past in the wind , you have the past in the wind , you 're going to take it in the plants , le-leverage , you 're going to lead and love plants .
Basters thinking that sciamans Jaguar travel again . I 'm still going to the end over the Lattea , or that the myths of the old people are still in Himalayas , the buddists are still in the damage of Dharmas , the buddists are still in sense of anthropology , and the idea that the world we live in sense , but it 's just a model of reality , but it 's just a model of reality is a model of reality ,
the consequence of a particular adaptive set of adaptative adaptive set that our stones did , well .
And , of course , we all share the essential tracts .
Everybody is . We all promise .
We 're subjects to start .
We have to death the inexorability of death , so we don 't surprise to the death . So we don 't surprising --
We all have a art .
What it 's the particular rhythm of the song , the rhythm of every culture .
It doesn 't matter that they 're the Penan forests of the Borneo , or the follow Vodoo 's the Kenya , or the desert of Kenya , or the Agya , or a settentrie in Kenya , or a cameras .
He was my journey of journey in the desert a month ago , or a al-a-the-sets of a country in the world 's world .
All of these people teaching us that there are other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , other ways of moving in the world .
And , if you think , you know , it 's a concept that can give you hope .
Insillar , the myriades of the world , they create a spiritual life and cultural life that is the planet and it 's important for the well-being of the planet , and it 's important for the planet as a biosphere .
And you can think of this cultural ragnosphere and you can call the etnosphere and you can call the etnosphere , the whole conception of all concepts , dream , ideas , inspiration , intuitions , intuitions , intuitions , to be the imagination of human consciousness .
The etnosphere is the fantastic patriage of humanity .
It 's the symbol of what we are and what we can be in how inququisitive .
And because the biosphere was so much consumed as it was so much as it happened to the thnosphere and very quickly ,
No biological , for example , would say that 50 percent of all the species was or is on the orders just because it 's fly because it 's fly because it 's fly in the most apocaly-to-diversity -- in the field of biological diversity -- and you don 't even even even close to the most optimistic hypocalm diversity .
The index of that is , of course , language loss .
When you were born 6,000 languages on this planet .
A language is not just from a vocabulary or a series of grammal rules .
A language is the sprayed of the human spirit .
It 's the middle of which the animal of every culture comes in the material world .
Every language is a forest , a rainforest , a thought , a re-likely ecosystem of the spiritual possibility .
And of those 6,000 languages , while we 're in Monterey , at least half the hasn 't ssurround in Monterey , at least half the children .
They 're not taught to children , who means , unless that doesn 't cambi something that 's already death .
What is more sad than being available from the silence , of being the last speak a language , of being the last speaker of the sagdom of the wisdom of the sandwich ?
This is horring was in some of the world every two weeks : every two weeks a year , a year , a send one old of the world 's lander and door with hang language .
And I know somebody who will say , " Is it not better ?
The world would not be a better place if I talk about all the same language ? " Benissim , then we talk all talk about yoruba . We talk about the dotonese .
We talk about kogi .
You 'll see a tract thing that is not to talk about your language .
I 'd like to like you to do a journey through the etnosphere --
a little journey in the etnosphere to give you a asp of what we 're losing .
Many of us forget that when I say , " different ways of existing , " I mean , " I mean , " different ways of existing .
We take for example this Barasana Barasana , in Amazon , the anacond people , the anaconda , which creates the myth of coming from the river of the west slatte sand-pink ,
It 's a popular people who can 't distinguitate the color of the green because you were able to be identified in the forest of the forest , which is depends the population .
They have a strange language and a matrimonial rule , called exogamia language , " exogamia , " You have to marry a different language .
All of that has radical past mitologic , supplies the particularly is that in these extens of the myth of the myths of the myths of none of the mists .
They 're just listening to and then start talking .
We take one of the most interesting tribe with which I lived , the Waorans of Ecuador nural , an incredible popular people who had the first contacts in 1958 .
In 1957 , five missionaries have been trying to make a mistake .
They had taken from the photographs that ran up that they would find them in a ran that they would have never seen anything bi-size .
They collected the photos , they spring them a shape or a shape and , not finding nothing , they 'd concluded that the diet , and they kill the five missionaries with the lance .
But Waorans don 't kill only do foreign the sandwich .
They were killing between them .
54 percent of the mortality was caused by themselves .
We 're sitting at eight generations and we found two natural death and when we 've been reached to know , they had admit that one of them was so so that he died , and then they were killed , and then killed him him .
The hunters were able to recognize the animal urine .
In the early ' 80s , I had a really interesting task when my Harvard professor asked me if I wanted to go to Haiti to enjoy me in Haiti to enjoy the base of the power of Duvalier and Tonton Macodents , and impossessing about the veiling fast , I was going to do the zombie .
To make sense of the myth , I would have to understand the Vodoo culture , and the Vodoo is not magic .
It 's pretty much about a complex metaphory of the world .
Very interesting .
If I ask you to tell me the great religions of the world , what would you say ?
Cristian-, Islam , Buddism , Ebraism , etc .
A continent is always left out , thinking that sub-Saharan Africa doesn 't have any religious fresh . And instead of yes and Vodoo is not the other that the distilside of these religious concepts of natic .
What makes the voodoo is the intense race is the intense race of life and death .
So the alive of them to hide the spirits .
The spirits can be invoced by the Great Acqua , they response to the rhythm of the dance of the dance of the world , so that for a short moment that for a short moment that 's the follow-up .
So , the vooy-like vooyers go to a church of God .
We give God . "
And from the moment you 're married , is the spirit that you 're driving , how can you do it in ?
So you 're in these incredible events : follow voodoo in the state of trance that touch impunes touch a very strong demonstration of the power of mind when it 's catalyzed in a state of extreme of extreme , exciting .
Tra all the people I lived the most extraordinary of the Sierra Nevada Santa Marta , in Santa Marta , in Colombia .
Does of the ancient civilizations that had been living on the caraibicks of the Colombia in the conquencies of the conquenjoy , the people were retreated on the winds of the lower massive plants .
In a continent macchievement , this people has never been conquisted by the spagreement .
But now they 're now governmented by a clero-, but their formation is so extraordinary .
The young people follows come from from families to three or four years , and live secreated in a world of buy and shadow in a world of buy and shadow in the bottom of the glaciers for 18 years .
Two dods nine years choices to reproduce the nine months of management that spend in the user-and-a-and-a-half years of the Grande Mother .
So , for all that time , is acculturated to the values of their society , values that preprayers , and only their prayers to be the balance of the context of the ecological balance .
At the term of this incredible initiation , they 're suddenly , and for the first time in their life , at 18 years , in that , in that consciousness of the first ball , when the sun is the values of the first paper , everything that they 've learned in theory , everything that has learned in theory . The first payed it is reconscious , everything that has learned in theory .
" I 'm going to ? Proprise how I said .
It 's amazing . Now it 's about you . "
They call the biggest brothers and say that we , the minor brothers , we are the destruction of the world .
This intuition level is extremely important .
When we think about the Ingengene populations and the environment of Rousseau and the old story of wildlife noble , which is a razareas , as a re-to-neighbor maybe I call Thoreeye-to-Earth .
The Ingenes are not no feeling .
There 's no space for these things in the Asmat the malarial paludi or in the Tibet , but thank you for the time and the ran , they created a mystical Earth based on not the concept of the Earth 's neighbor , but on an intuition , the concept that the Earth can live only live only only only is because it 's infused by human consciousness .
What does that mean ?
It means that a boy of Ande who grows up the mountain is a spirit of Apu who will leave her destiny , which will be a destroy different . And it will have a very different human being able , and will have a very different report with the mountain that place to a Montana 's a boy of rock , which is a mountain is a friendly sent of rocks .
That 's the demour of a spirit or a mineral cutter is irrelevant .
What 's interesting is the metaphor that defines the relationship between the individual world and natural world .
I grew up in the forests of the British Columbia , credating that forests were able .
And that made me a human being different from my friends Kwakiutl who believe that the forests are the forests of Hukuk and the batch of paradise and the batch of the world , we 're living in the north of the world , we 're in the world , we know how to the Hamatsa .
If you start to consider that these cultures can create different reality , you could start to understand some of them .
I took this picture to the april in the nordocccest Amazon .
Mayatheist , the most powerful of you have heard of the ayahuash , the most powerful substance of the monstrate of the samong .
What makes it fascinating the ayahuash is not the pharmacological potential of the sustaff , but his elaboration . It 's composed to two elements .
On one hand , this lian lian lap-carbon series of carboline , harmful and harmful , harmful and harmful , slightly .
Take the only plants , it has a blub that altery a little bit that it 's a little bit of the consciousness , but it 's choined with leaves of the family family of coffee said Psychotria revision of redis .
This plants contains powerful , triptamine , very similar to the serotonin , dimethoxtamine-5 , methoxtamine .
If you ever see the Yanomami , pulling on the nose that they do from a different species , they 're contained methoxydimethoxtamine .
Tiring that poor is a little bit like being disparated by a little bit like being disparated by a card of the windddust and land on a sweet of electricity . Risate not create a destsion of reality .
I was often with my professor , Richard Evan Shultes , the man who had taken the psychical function , with his discovery of the lobe fungi in the ' 30 in Mexico .
I think my arguesis , you can 't classifer these tripamines like hallucinogens because if you 're not able to tell anybody of being hallucinated .
It 's possible to be in the waste , just if you 're asking the other chemicals that you know , the MAO .
Now , the beautiful : Your carbs that are in this liants are injaws in this lian inhibiters of MAO , the same kind of necessary to potve triptamines . The question spontaneous question : in a fle-to-th-like , these people are in fact not like these people who are in this way , create a biochemical version that is sound that are not like , but that if you can see in this way , create a biochemical sum that 's inated version of the same .
We use the great eupherror of the proof the proof the proof the proof the proof the proof the proof .
But if we ask the Indians , they 'll say , " The plants are talking about . "
What does that mean ?
This tribes , Cofan , has 17 variety of ayahuash , which are narrow in the forest , and that 's our eyes would reinto the same species .
If you ask them , how they 'll stbilion their tassonomes will say , " I thought , " I thought I could do not do it ? " I said , " No . "
The solution is : you take the 17 variety of a night and each one will sunch with a different tone .
With this doesn 't flow Harvard , but it 's much more interesting than counting the stones .
Now , [ applaushed ] the problem is that even the ones of us that have to heart people find them painting them , but somehow redots are in the history of respect to our real world world , and pass over .
In fact , the 20th century , in 300 years , it won 't remembered for his wars or technologies , but rather like the thing that we 're stopped and acactively accepted or accepted passively or accepted to the planet 's mass destruction of biological diversity and cultural diversity of the planet . Now the problem is not the change .
All cultures through the centuries were involved in a dance for new lifetime .
And the problem is not technology .
The Indians Sioux , they 're not stopped to be Sioux when they put up the arch and rect like that Americans have no stopped to be Americans when they put in the horse and calan .
It 's not the change or technology that threatening the integrity of the thnosphere . It 's the power .
The flight flight flight .
And if you give a look at the world , you 'll find that these are not destinated cultures .
They 're living creatures and dynamic stric forces out of the identificables that go beyonic forces .
I 'm not like that you 're in the paper of Penan --
a people who were in Sarawasian nomitic people , a popular that lived in the forest to a generation , and now reduced to the servitus and now reduced to the servitus and prostitution on the revers of the river of the river of the river of the river of the river , which seems to be a half Borneo to the Meridional Meridional Meridional Meridional Meridional Meridional Meridional Meridional Monan ,
With the forest stick , I 'm going to be like the forest .
Or , in the case of Yanomami , are disease that have come with the discovery of the gold .
If we move on the mountains of Tibet , where I 'm doing a lot of research , you 'll see the hard flight flight flight .
Like the genocide , the genocide extinction of a popular , is convicted to the style of life , but the wildlife destruction of a population of a popular popular , not only is not convicted , but I adverted tising in some environments , because it 's a part of developing developing developing .
And you can 't understand the suffering of Tibet until you 're in the beginning .
I 've been path the 6,000 miles from Chengdu in Western Chength through the Tibet s-the-s-and-a-up , and just arrived in Lhasa with a young colleague , but only came to Lhasa . I realized what 's behind the statistics we feel about .
6,000 sacred sacred sacred sacred ,
1.2 million people killed by the military Cultural Revolution .
The father of this guy was ascriticized at the Panchen Lama .
That means that it was killed in the Chinese invasion .
His fasted with Sua Santity during the diaspora that has brought the people in Nepal .
His mother was impriated and her hit was to be rich .
It was brought to the age of two years from his gonna digging in the age of two years of her gonna because it couldn 't have to live without him .
The sister , which did the same , was put in reducing reducation .
One day , he inavailable to a window of Mao and , for this transgression , was put it in the forced jobs , it was put in the jobs for seven years .
The Tibet of the Tibet is inoveroverwhelmed , but the recently spired the people 's people .
At the end , everything is reduces to a choice .
We want to live in the monothic world of the monothic world of diversity or we want to account the poly-diversity ?
The great anthropologists Margaret Mead , before he said that his biggest fear was that , in our way to this view of the world , not only one of the whole range of human imagination reduced to a limited modate of thinking , but one day we 're going to wake up from a sleep standing forget to a sleeping day .
And it 's umillion of remembering that our species is 600,000 years .
The Neolitical Revolution , who gave us the agriculture , which has done us to the seed of the smooth of the smoke of the skiing of the chiaman with the prostype of the track , and we talk about 10,000 years ago .
The modern industrialized world world has 300 years old .
And that the story is not suggests that we have the answers to all the challenges that we have to deal in the millennia to come .
When to these myriades of the world is asked what it means to be humans , they 're asking 10,000 different voices .
And it 's in these answers that we all have the chance of being what we are : a kind of conscious , which has to do all the people and all the gardens can fall the people can fire . And there 's great moments of optimism .
I took this picture on the northern extremity , the sorts of the Olaya , and I went to the whales of Inuit , and this man , Olaya , and he told me the wonderful story of her grandfather .
The canadese government wasn 't always gentle with the Inuit 's the ' 50s to stabilish our supremice , we have to them in colonies .
The grandfather of this man refused to go .
The family , I temonkeys for her life , and he took him , and all of his attitude .
You have to know that Inuit don 't have the cold , they exploit .
The packs of the slete in origin were made of pain .
The grandfather did not intimight from the night night or the libraric night , or the libraries that was .
It 's sgattaighter , you 've cut the pantalone in the skin and you have defecated in their hand . When I did they did it , they worked a lama .
It 's spruited about the pointed pointed of this hell , and when they solid solid it , and he killed a dog .
It has taken the dog and created a briefly , with the hacade-range , he imbriefly made a sleep , and he imbriefly made a sleep , hit 's caccess to the bank .
We want to talk about cavarself-resilience with nothing ? [ Raunted ] . And this , in different ways , [ Applausi is the symbol of resilience of the world .
In the april of the California government reddate to the total control of an area of the biggest territory of the California and Texas put together .
It 's the new paper . It 's called Nunavut .
It 's an independent territory . They all of the mineraries .
One of the splendidate of a nation-state can recognize with his people .
And , to finish , I think it 's pretty obvious at least in those remote ars of the planet , realizing that they 're not remote to be remote .
For somebody 's home .
They represent sexual imagination that are rising to the dawn of temple . And for all of these children , like the dream of these children , become part of the cloud of geography .
First , we 're in National Geographic , we convinced that politicians will never come to nothing .
We believe that the polemidst --
[ Applausi is not persuasive , but we believe that stories can change the world , and perhaps we 're the best institution to tell stories of the world . Every month is to tell the stories .

Thank you .
I 'm going to talk to you about some things I wrote in this book that I hope you 've already heard and try to try to figure out some connection , in case you wouldn 't notice them .
I want to start with what I call the " dogma official dogma .
The official dogma of what ?
The official dogma of all the Western industrial society . The official dogma official dogma , " If we want to massive to the well-being of our citizens . "
The reason is , from one side , in fact that freedom is in itself a value , is a very precious , is useful , utile , essential for humans .
Over the other is that if we 're free , each of us can act to do it for the whole thing that massive , not no one that you 're going to call our well-being , without no one that I decided to name our name .
The way to massive freedom is massive to be massive .
More choices , the more they 're free , and more , and more more , is their wealth , the more more of the wealth .
This , I think , is so deeply radical in society that nobody would dream to put it in doubt .
And it 's also doubled in our lives .
I 'm going to show you some examples of what progress has made possible .
This is my supermarket . It 's not particularly big .
I lost a simple note of the condition for insalate .
In my supermarket , there are 175 conditions , without contacing the 10 variety of oil variety of oil , and the 12 aceters that you can buy for a huge number of condition of condition in the incbreaking circumstance that nobody of one of the 175 proning circumstance of the fire of the weight .
That 's how the supermarket .
Then you go to the electronic store to buy a stereo : you , lector CD , radio , radio , radio , blood .
And in this single electronic store , there 's a big number of components .
We can make six million different and a half of different combinations using the components that there are only one store .
You have to admit that there is a lot of choice .
Onther fields : the world of communications .
Once , when I was a child , you could get all the desire telephone services , and they were forced by Mom Bell .
It was going to leave the phone , you didn 't buy it .
A consequence of that , the telephones were never break .
These days are gone .
We have a variety of telephones , especially between the cellular cellular mobile .
Here 's the cell phones of the future .
My favorite is the middle of MP3 , cut out of nose , and foreign for the crlavor , and forced to the crlavor .
If you don 't have seen it in the store under the house , you 're well certain that soon is going to get .
And what happens is that people are in the stops and this question . And you know , you know what the answer is ? The answer is " No . "
It 's not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn 't do too many things .
So , in other aspects of life that are much more important than the aquists , you know , the same explosion of choices .
Assistence : no longer in the United States that you go from the doctor and you say what you have to do .
Instead , I go to the doctor , and the doctor tells you , " OK , we could do A , or B , " A has these benefits and these land-risks . What do you want to do ? "
You say , " Dotore , what should I do I do ? "
And the doctor says , " A has these benefits and these risks , and you have these benefits and you have these benefits . "
What do you want to do ? "
And you say , " Dotore if she was me , what would do ? "
And the doctor : " But I 'm not . "
The result of the result of the mality of mality , expression that makes it look like a beautiful thing .
But it 's not that one move the weight and responsibility to make somebody somebody knows know something , which is the doctor , to someone else else else doesn 't know -- and it 's almost certainly maled -- and so not in the condition to make decisions from patient .
There 's a huge marketing of products , you know , you know , that if you think you don 't have a sense , because you can 't make any sense , because we can 't buy them .
But if we can 't buy them , why do they public icize them ?
The answer is that they want to domesting the doctor to ask him to make it .
What of this fundamental as our earth is orever a question of choice , how you see in this drew , " We don 't want to forcing children . They 're going to give their sex at at the moment . " We don 't reach the same time . " We have to invent .
And we can reinventing how many times we have to reinventing us .
That means that every morning , at the risk , you have to decide that kind of person you want to be .
I think it was the family and marriage , a time perspective , a time perspective , which was that you were married the most soon possible , and it was that you were marriage the most soon possible .
The only real choice was with who , not when , and even when , and even what to do after .
Over the day , it 's really to play .
I teach students very smart , and I do their 20 percent in less than a time .
And it 's not because they 're a brilliant , not because they 're not so brilliant .
but because they 're impensive , I mean , I should be married or not ? I should be married or not ? I should do that ? "
" Do I have to get marrier ? " I have to think before I was the children or career ? "
They 're interrogatives logatives .
And they 're trying to answer these questions , even if this implic is not complete the companies that I 'm sitting and not getting a beautiful vote to my examples .
And they have to do it . They 're important questions .
Now , the work : we 're lucky , like Carl was , because technology allows us to work every minute , every day , from every day , from every day , from every day , from the Hotel Randolph .
So I 'm talking about , there 's a corner , and I won 't tell anybody what the WiFi works .
I don 't tell you , because I want to use it .
What does that mean , this amazing freedom of choice that we have to continue , and we have to continue , and we have to do it or not .
We can go to the boy , with the cell phone , with the mobile phone in a pockberry , Blackberry in the other , and the notebook , typically on the ginock .
And even though they 're all spent that we see our son is also asking the game , we 're also asking the game , we 're also asking this call ? "
" I have to answer this email ? I have to abbozzing this letter ? "
And even when the answer is " no , " no , all this makes the experience of your child 's game of your son , very different than what would be in other conditions .
So , from any part of the look , little things and big , the objects , the things and life , life is a question of choices .
Once the world was this : Ovation , there were some possibilities , but it wasn 't a question of choice .
The world is today looks like this : The dilemma is , " Is it a positive thing , or negative ? "
The answer is Swear .
The positive latest latest latest ones .
All of this choice is two of negative effects on people .
The first , paradoxally , is that makes paralysis that it makes liberation .
With a lot of options between which choices , become very difficult to do it .
I give you an example : a conduct example : a conduct for flap .
A connected of the Vanguard data , the giant source society , the giant source of pension , with about a million employees in 2,000 different companies .
What she found is that for every 10 solutions that come in over , the percentage of adhesion , the percentage of two percent .
With 50 founding found-four-percent of adhhesions than when they are available . Why ?
Because with 50 fources between between which choosing , is maledtly difficult to decide , and they choice is remaining to the inner tomorrow .
And to ask , and I 'm still asked , tomorrow , and of course , tomorrow , and of course , and the question is never coming .
You know , it doesn 't mean that only these work from old old , because they 're not going to have enough money , it also means that decision is so hostical that the decision is so hostical that allows the birth of the work of the work of the work .
I 'm not participating , they 're losing until five thousand dollars a year from work , which would be well disposed to be there .
So , the paralysis a consequence of you have too many choices .
And I think that makes the world that I make this .
" And to finish , for ethernity : ketchup , or maion or maion ? "
You 'd like to take the right decision , if it 's the eternity , right ?
You don 't want to choose the wrong wrong , and you know , and you 're not going to choose .
So this is the first effect . The second is that even if we can avoid paralysis and doing a choice , at the end , we 're less , we were in less options of how we would be done with less options in which choose .
And this is different for reasons .
One of these is that with a lot of condition between which choice , if you buy one and not perfect , it 's easy to imagine that you could have a different choice that would be better . And what happens is that the alternative , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , and the repair the result of the rest of the resdatiffenses ,
even when it was a very good decision .
Over you choices , more is easy to dislierves of any detail that is insodatives of the option of choice .
And also , there 's what economists call expensive opportunity .
Dan Gilbert clear , has very well stamattine like the value of things we depends on the things we confront .
Of the rest , when there are so many options , it 's easy to represent characteristics of alternative alternative ars and be less satives .
Here 's an example . I 've been schools with all the ones that are not New York .
But that 's what you probably think you 're probably going to .
There 's this couple to Hamptons .
A place of lussian .
It 's splendida . Ot-day . It 's all about them .
It 's nothing . But what he thinks is , " Well , the objection , is Agoam . "
" All my neighbors in Manhattan is . "
" I could talk about it right in front of the home . "
And it 's two weeks of the idea that 's losing -- every day -- every day -- the possibility of parking where it wants .
The constantly opportunity decrease that we have , even when the choice was there there .
And the more of the options that we have to consider , more the features will be active .
Here 's another example .
This is telling us a lot of things .
It 's about living the moment , and perhaps in the living slowly .
But the most important point is that anything you 're going to do , you 're not doing other .
The things that we don 't choose to be a lot of attractive , which can make less attractive what we do .
Third point : spiral growing of expectations .
I tried it on my skin buying a new jeans .
I 'm almost always jeans .
Once jeans were just like , you were just like , buying them and besty , they were discovered , only after I had a life and work , just after I had a lot of times , they started to go well .
So I went to buy a couple of a new when the old those old were gone , and I said , " You need a couple of jeans , this is my cut . "
The commit said , " Li wants slim slim , and the relationship , rely , and fit ? "
Do you want to the cernier or the bottons ? " Stonehed or " acidlavor " acidlavor " acidlavery ?
" Do you want them to be ? "
" Do you want to say , or stretch them ? Bla bla bla -- " Continuated to elenit .
I was sbalord , and after a little bit , I want the guy that -- I want the one that -- that was the only guy , " I want to say , " I want to all jeans , and I got out of the jeans , and then I went out of the mile , I 'm going to say , " I 'm going to do .
It was the massive . With all that I had the best .
But I felt worse .
Why ? I wrote a whole book to understand it .
The reason I was worse to is that with all that I had all the choice was very high , jeans had to be perfect .
I was a little expectation of it . I didn 't expect any exceptional , when there was just a guy , but when I saw 100 different steps , accidents had to be perfect .
What I had been buy , but not perfect .
I was talking about what I was trying to do was satisfied in the expectations .
The addition of options in life is not that the expectations that these have respect to the options of the same .
And this will proof less satifation , even when the results are good .
No one in the world of marketing , if you realize .
Because if they knew , you 're not aware of what I 'm talking about .
The truth is more like this .
" You were better when it was worse . " The reason that was better when it was worse was worse is that when you were worse to the surprised .
Over the world we live in -- the world we live in -- opuling citizen , industrialized industrialized faction -- the massive that we can hope is that things are in the altex .
You never have surprised to evolve because your expectations , my expectations , my expectations , I 'm ingantic .
The secret of happiness -- what you 're here -- is , " Baxy expectations " Yes , you want . "
I mean , small moment I 'm autobiographic -- which I really married and my wife is really amazing .
I couldn 't do it , I couldn 't do it .
But it 's not always a bad thing .
And finally , a consequence of buying a couple of jeans when there 's just that jeans is that when you have no satisfacts , and you know , " Why ? "
" Who is responsible ? " , the answer is close .
The world is responsible . What could I do you ?
When there are hundreds of jeans , and you buy one insodatisfacing , and ask you who is responsible , is the clear , it 's closer , it 's the clear , you know ,
You 'd better have to do better .
With hundreds of variety of variety , there are no skeeping variety of different variety of variety of variety of variety of variety of variety of variety of variety of variety of variety of variety of variety have , there are no sitting in the insuccess .
So when people take decisions , even if the result is alive , they feel like they 're insoddissatives , they 're insodded , and they 're going to hold them .
In the last few years , the depression is exploded in the industrialized world .
I think that a meaningful factor -- not the only one , but important -- of this wave of depression is that people have delusion because it standard are too high .
And when they have to explain this situation they think that the colve is .
So the final result is that we 're better , objectively , but we feel worse .
Let me remember you .
This is the official dogma , what we all take for good and it 's completely fake . It 's not true .
There 's no doubt that a little bit of choice is better than I don 't have any facts , but from this doesn 't really mean that a lot better choice is better than a little bit .
There 's a critical value , magic . I don 't know what it is .
But I 'm sure that we 've been done by a piece of the level where they 're getting better .
Now , from the political point of view -- I 've almost finished -- from political point of view , the nocccore is the follow-up .
What allows this all of choices in the industrial society is the material wealth .
There are many places in the world , and you know , you know , where the problem is not that they have too many choices .
The problem is they have too .
So the focused of that I 'm talking about is a malbeing exusive of modern , rich society .
And what it makes you depress and climb this : Steve Levitt talked yesterday of how those expensive and the pursuit of those expensive and the pursuit of money .
I mean that these choices , complicated and avoid , is not that they 're just unuseful .
I 'm sure deleteries .
They 're doing worse .
If a little bit of what in our society is allows so much choice was reversated in those where people have too much possibilities , it 's not just their life to improve but our own life .
This is what economists call a paretian improving improving .
A redistribution redistribution is good at all -- not only to the poor -- because of this choice in excess , and it 's going to take us .
So , to conclude , " Fill , you can become everything you want "
You , people of culture , you 'll think , " But what does that fish ? "
" It 's obvious that you can 't make anything in a box of glass . "
" A imagination , a limited vision of the world --
and I 've been interpreted this so , at the beginning .
But then , I realized that , instead , I realized that fish knows the long knows the long knows .
Because the reality of the facts is that if you 're missing the boction , so that " everything is possible , " you can 't get the freedom .
If you breaking the bock , in a way that everything is possible to defy .
You 're going to take the paralysis , and you 'll get the benefit .
Everybody needs a sphere .
This is almost certainly too closely , perhaps even for the fish , and surance for us .
But the absence of a few symbolic symmbot is a recipe for infelity and , for the ruin .
Thank you very heart .
