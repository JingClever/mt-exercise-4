I 've showed these slide demonstrate demonstrate that the calottic calottic , which for almost three million years had the size of 48 million years had the size of 48 percent .
However , this underneath the problem of the problem because it doesn 't show the spread of the ice .
The glacial calotage is , in a sense , a sense , the pyeless of global climate system .
It 's expanies and stand retreatment .
The next slide will be a rapid carrelated to the last 25 years .
The ice acts have been draw in red .
As you see , they 're going to the blue wall .
That 's the ice in the inverny , which you ritira of extense .
You can see that the psydases , of five years or more , is like the blood , which is like the blood , which is how the blood , which is how the bloom .
In 25 years , it 's past that , so it 's so .
This is a problem because the restation of the glaciated around the ocean , where there are enormous amount of carbon that , where there are enormous amount of carbon that , they 're transformed in metmetan microbes .
I spect to the totality of global warming , the amount of warming , that could be double , super----rate , super--return .
In some laghi , a little profound in Alaska metan is already rebolling out of water .
The professor Katey Walter in the University of Alaska blow landed with a team in the front of a team , the last last invernal .
Video : Wow ! Al Gore : I 'm going to be good .
A reason is that this is that this termical exchange Groenland from the northern Groenland .
This is a glacial pyacts .
The took it never reached livels .
This is the Kangerlussuaq , in the west of Groenland .
If you want to know how sun the sea level for the pace of ice on terraferm , here is where the sea .
These current running out of the deal .
The other side of the planet : Antards , the largest block of the planet .
The month , the scientist fasted have diqueen that the painting of the ice is in negative , and that the West Antarctaught on some sun issue , is particularly faster in the leaves .
Equote six feet of the level of the active , like Groenland .
Sulla Himalaya , the largest third block , and they see new laghi , which few years ago were glaciers .
40 percent of the world population will revolution half of the potable water from the potail .
Sulle Ande : this glacier is the source of water potail .
The laumented it 's increased .
But when it 's when it diminugly , it 's happening to the water .
In California , the nenow on the Sierra Nevada is 40 percent .
The rates are in the crisis .
The predictions , as you have read , they 're good .
The growth is growing in the world door to a remarkable crossing .
The environmental disasts are increasing a ritm outside and without precedented .
Four times more numbers in the last 30 years , I respect 75 .
This is a whole sweaving of all insustainable .
If you look at the context of the historic context , if you can see the consequences .
In the last five years we 've added 70 million tonnels of CO2 every 24 hours -- 25 million tons in the ocean every day .
Look at the East Pacific , the American American , from the American American , to the west , and on both both of the substance of the continent , where there 's a radical ror of the ocean .
The major cause of global warming , with deforestation , which is 20 percent , it 's the use of fossil fuel .
The oil is a problem , and the carbon is even worst .
The United States is one of the two countries with the emissions , together to China .
And it was proposing to build a lot of carbon .
But we 're seeing a direction of a direction .
These are the anullated projects in the last few years and some green proposition .
So , there 's a political load in our country .
The carbon industry and oil have spent 250 million dollars in the last year to promote carbon , which is a by-wisdom , which is a oxygold .
And I remember that image me ,
So , Natal Tennessee , where I live , there was a 3.8 billion light-glass of four-glass .
You 've seen it on the news .
This is the second largest flusbed in America .
It 's successaround Natal .
The puzzle of one of the carbon industry was this .
Video : â™« Frosty carbon is a sweet and happy .
It 's abundancing here in America , and it 's growing our economy .
Frorosty carbon is more and more and more and more and more .
It 's a good price , adorable and the work they keep the stage .
Al Gore : The way here is a lot of the West Virginia .
The bigger big mineran minerary society on the mountains . This is his administrator .
Video : Don Blakenship : Sark , Nancy Pelokid , Nancy Peloday -- they 're not going to know what they 're talking about .
Al Gore : So the Alleance for Protext of Clima has two campaign .
This is a one of them , a part .
Video : Acore : ALergy we see climate change as a sery , as a sery sery to our business .
So our priority is investing a big amount of money in a advertising advertising and confused the verity of the carbon .
In fact , carbon is not sporite .
We think it 's also -- it 's also a good hon the dealing .
So , not preocups of climate change .
Let me do it .
Video : Acore : Carbone pulit -- you 've heard a lot of talk about .
So we 're going to make a turn into a structure to the avaning of how much it 's about carbon .
Straordinary ! The machines are a little bit , but this is the sound of technology , but this is the sound of technology .
The carbon consumption is between the main coal warming , but the remarkable technology , but the very very much technology that you see it 's changing everything .
You look at a glass : this is the odiergain technology .
Al Gore : Fify , the positive alternative , the positive economic security and the national sesesecurity .
Video : The U.S. is in crime ; the economy , the national security crisis .
The fix that lines all : our dependence from fossil combustible , like carbon sporite and oil oil oil oil practice and oil oil oil practice .
Now , there 's a new , audace , audace solution for the surface .
Not a power 100 percent of energy , in 10 years .
A plan to reput America to work , make sure , and make sure it , and help stop the global warming .
Finally , a solution that basts solution to solve our problems .
Not power . Scoon more .
Al Gore : This is the last .
Video : It 's about return to America .
One of the fastest ways to keep dependence from the combustible that we kill our planet .
Comparsa : The future is here . I feel , a new energy network .
Noves : Neggs : Nuoves for two : Nuovi investments .
Not : Repower : Repower . It 's time to be realists .
Al Gore : A old , the old man says , " If you want to go fast , you go to fast .
If you want to go away , you go together . "
We have to go away , fast .
Thank you very much .
The last year TED is a introduction on the LHC .
And I promise to get to the back to how the machine works .
So I get it up . And for those people who had the other time , the LHC is the largest scientific ever tented -- 27 kilometers of the conference .
His companies that were at least to reach the conditions that were less than a billion billion on the beginning of the universe -- until 600 million times a second .
So this is just environment .
This is the machine under Ginevra .
We 're going to have these min-Big Bang inside the reflies .
This is what I work . It 's called ATLALALATLAS -- it 's 44 feet and it 's 22 feet .
This is a spectacular picture of ATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLALATLALATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATL
To 10 settember last year we have acceso the machine for the first time .
And this picture was taken from ATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLALATLALATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATL
It was because of immense festeggiving in control .
It 's an image of the first fascinating particles that had done everything around the LHC , entering in collision , with a part of the LHC , and spread particles inside the reflies .
In other words , when we see that image 10 settember , we realized that the machine , we realized that this is a great vittory .
I don 't know if it was this is to make us more or this , when someone went on on Google and vide that the page was this .
That means we 've had a cultural impact beyond .
And so , a week later , there was a problem with the machine , just to these brought here -- these brought these brought here -- these brought them .
These brought 13,000 prining when the machine works at the massive of the potence of the potence .
Now , the technical technical techniques and say , " It 's not true . I 'm slumn too much . "
And instead they can do it because when they 're very cool cool cool .
So , at least 271 degrees , at least 271 degrees , in the space between the stars , these bones can bring that the current .
In one of the guns between the most novehicle magneti in the LHC , there was a fitten difed defect .
So the file file , they surry up slightly , and 13,000 practice suddenly met a electrical resistence .
This was the result .
Now , this is more impressive if you think these magneti fish that these magneti fish are 20 tons , and they 've been moved about 30 centimeters .
They 've been drugs about 50 magneti magneti .
We had to take them , what we did .
We 've got restinated and enjoy .
Now they 're now now now they 're reporting all the subject .
By the end of march the LHC will be again ,
We 'll access it , and we 're going to be expected to the right right or the land-, and continue so our adventure to find what the morons are morning that are the universe .
Now , of course , in a way , these incidents reaccended the debate on value of science and engineering in front of science and engineering in front of science and engineering in front of science . It 's easy to to the future .
I think the fact that the fact that it 's so hard , I think it 's the value of things like LHHC .
I want to end with the words of a English scientist , Humphrey , which , I suppose , in difense of the inuseful , his pulland-up , his pupille , his pupille , he said , " Nist , he said , " Nist , " Nist 's so dangerous for the human refoundation of science is , which is not a measured , and our triond . "
Thank you .
I want to start wondering about when , from children , from children , play tomormorning .
While you get to how to reach and deal with them , take them and move , learned , you know , actually , to think and solving problems and deal with space .
The space is very very connection to the way we understand a lot of part of the world around us .
So , from information usually , from the useful of our interaction with physical objects , with my consultation , and my collaborator Jeevan Kalanithi , I started to ask , " And if we use a computer , when we use a computer , instead of the computer , as a pollyer , as a polly-re-candand-widding , we could actually affect the sor , we could actually affect the hands , a sor ,
and it would be it to our please ?
The question was so interesting that we decided to explore the answer , building Siftable .
In a few words , a Siftis a great computer interactive as a big biscoped .
In a few words , a Siftis a great computer interactive as a big biscoped .
You can move it with your hand , they can see " between them , " You know , " they 're going to be a screen and a radio wireless .
But it 's basically , they 're physical objects , like the morning , you can move it simply , you can move it ,
The Siftable is an example of a new ecosystem to manipulate information .
And as they 're going to become more physical , conscious of the movement , and the other hand , and as they become more physical , conscious , of the other , how we can we move them , we can explore new and different styles of interaction .
I 'll start with some simple example .
This Siftable is configurate to show video : if you cinleave it into a direction , the video roterm , the video rates so if you 're going to hit .
These retracks are conscious conscious recognize .
If you deal with them , they 're interested in what they 're going to have around .
If they 're circumb , they can get it up a little bit .
If they 're circumb , they can get it up a little bit .
They also have their movement and inlination .
We have realized that one of the interests of the interaction was that we could use common on data , to example , " a color like , " a color like a liquid .
In this case , we have three Siftable , we have three Siftable , and I can use them to the color , where they 're missed .
and I can use them to the color in the central , where they 're missed .
If we 're too too , we can get a little bit about it .
I 'm also also beautiful possibility of appreciation , like language , the mathematics and games where people can try to prove things , and you know , the results the results of the immediately ,
Now I 'm going to --
This is a sequence of Fibonacting that I do with a program of equations .
So here we have a game of words that 's half of the Scarabeer and Boboble .
Pratically , at every turnal turn-case letter , Pratically , at every turnal turnal , at every turnal turnal , and as cerks , and as cerks , and you know , the way , and the cerks of the compories .
Then about 30 seconds remissed , and you have a new land-set of reading and new possibility to try .
Thank you .
Here 's how we 've got a ggglowing the Lab , I made it so that I tried to try and turn a video .
They have a lot of them .
And one of the interesting things of this kind of application is that not to give you a lot of instructions .
You just say , " Compons of words , and they 're going to be exactly what to do .
Here 's how many people do it .
This is our young girl tester , there 's a younger , there 's the right .
It was actually wanted to impilling them .
They only ran up the morning , for him .
Now , this is a application of a interactive paper .
We wanted to build a tool for the language of the language of the Lui Lui is Felix .
It can put new characters in the scene , and it 's Siftable .
It can put new characters in the scene , and it 's Siftable .
So that 's doing it is doing the sun .
Video : Sun is sun .
David Merrill : Now she brought a treatment in the scene .
Video : The treatment .
Bel work ! It 's !
So , you get either and put up close to the characters --
Video : Bau !
-- inventing the story .
Video : Hey !
DM : It 's a very very open story , and it can decide him how you slew .
DM : It 's a very very open story , and it can decide him how you slew .
Video : Vola on , gat the gyard .
DM : The last example I have a time to show you is a tool , I 've got to show you a tool , to samples and exeguing music .
It 's a tool , it 's a tool , to samples and execting music .
The Siftable here are agagagaging from the bottom and bacteria .
Each one of these has four different different variations , and you can choose what to use .
You can also put these sounds in a sequence from to compories to your pleasure .
And it 's just to make it a source and a sequence . "
These are actually actually , you can control from the vision , like the reverbero and the filter .
The attacks to a particular sound and then inclens to enjoy it .
And then there are general effects as time and fly , and they applied to the intersequence .
We look like it works .
Video : We 're going to make a basis in two Siftable sequence , we 're going to put it in a series , we 're going to add the other base .
Now I 'm going to put a bottom line .
Video : DM : Now I add of percussions --
Video : And now I 'm going to put the filter to the bacteria , so I can control the effect from the vision .
Video : I 'm going to be fast the intersequence , the intersequence , or the other side or .
Video : I 'm going to add the filter to give the low to the expression to give more expression .
Video : I 'm going to recombining the sequence to the flight . "
So I don 't have to plan it before , but I can improve , and then I can improve , and it 's over the mainly .
And now , finally , I can spring the whole sequence , the left Sifly the Sifly , "
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is build new interfaces as well as our brain and more and more sounds like our brain and body .
And today , I 've had time to show you one of the result of this , and also some possibility that we try to bring out of the lab .
The concept I want to get to you is that 's coming to this new generation of designed objects to interact with digital media , which will bring information in our world in the way we want .
Thank you very much .
I don 't see the now of talk to you with all of you .
I 'm a writing writing .
I 'm going to get books , but it 's the most of this , of course .
It 's also love and the fascination of my life .
And I don 't look like that can change .
But I said this , something very success in my life and my career , which has brought me to get to rebrate the interor I got to get the interor I 'm going to get this job .
And the particular thing is I 've written this book , this biography called " " Mangia , Prega , " which , diversity from my books , for some reason why we came out in the world and it became a great , and it became a great feelational , bestyle , and it 's a great interational , bestyle .
And the result is that everywhere in the time , people treatments treatment like I was constructed .
It 's true -- constructed , constructed !
They 're going to be on my worried and they say , " You don 't do that much more than I could do it better ?
You don 't have a fear to continue to write for all life without being able to create a book that can be important to someone ? "
that can be importance to someone ? "
It 's unsure , you know .
But it may go worst , at the end of the most of the years ago , when I started to say , I was a writing writing -- I was a writing writing .
I would go to the same reaction .
And people said , " Do I couldn 't get successed ?
You know , you know , you know , the billabs killed you ?
You 've got to do this mestize for all life without anything anything is going to come out and death on a cue of dreaming with the pile of rainfrants with the wildness of failure ? "
So you know .
The answer -- the short answer to all these questions is , " Yes . "
I 've got a lot of all those things .
I 've always had a paper .
And I also have a lot of other things that people can 't have to be inguess .
As the algae and other spent things .
But , how about it was that I was going to write what I thought and I 'd ask me last multiple is why ?
Is it rational ?
It 's logic that anyone who has to expect it to be spended by a job that you 've been born to do .
But what 's this particular in the impress , and it 's so much about the health care of the mental health care , in a way that other carries don 't do ?
How do my father , for example , he was a chemical engineer and not remember one time in his 40 years of activity that was asked if I was asked if he was a paura to be engineer ?
It was never -- that block of my engineer John , how does it happen ?
It didn 't work that , you know ?
Onestly , the engineers like a group not have certainly , in the seugal centuries , guadagnation , the reputation of depressive to be alcolied .
We 've got a writers , we have this reputation , and not just writers , but creativity of every kind of , we have this reputation of being enormous instaable .
And it 's not what you look at the triad of the magniques of the magniques of the magniques that , only in the 2th century , they 're going to die young and often for their hand .
And also the ones that are not suicians to be really dised by their dundons .
Nortman Mailer , before he died , in the last interview , " Every my book was killed a little more , " an extraordinary affermonation about the work of their life .
But we don 't do that when we hear that because we 've heard these things so long that in some way , we 're completely interiorized and accept the notion that creativity and suffering are in some way of the lawy-up and the art , will always get to the analysis in .
And the question I want to take all here today is , you know , you know , you know , what about this idea ?
It 's good this -- because it 's also looking at a centimeter of distance to me not well for this supposition .
I think it 's odious .
And I think it 's also dangerous and I don 't want to see the perpetuated in the next century .
I think it 's better to encourage our big creative minds to live .
And I know , I know , in my case -- in my case -- it would be very dangerous to start to fire that I 'm going to start to get the constance , which is a very date of my career .
Ovreal -- I 'm pretty much young , I 've got about 40 years .
I 've still got about four decades of work in me .
And it 's very likely that anything I 'm going to be right now going to be right from the world as the work that used after my last book .
I 'm going to slavery , because we 're all more or unamic here -- it 's likely that my greatest success is to my spent .
Oh , Gesus , who thought !
You know this is the kind of thought that leads a person starting to start to bing the nine of the morning and I don 't want to do it .
I would keep going to continue to do this work we do .
So , the question is it , how ?
And so it looks , after a lot of reflections , which the way to work to continue to get to create a psychologic psychologic psychologic psychology , OK ?
I have to some way to find a safety of the reference between me , and my natural anxial anxion that I writing the writing that I was trying to get it , and I was trying to see the past year models to how to start looking through the time , trying to see how to have the best ideas and more sane and more sane and more sane and more sane and more sane and more sane than being able to see how to do it ,
to how to help people create creative to manage the inerent emotional response .
And that research has brought to the Grek and ancient Rome .
Seguiteguites , because I 'm going to go back .
The ancient Grek and the ancient Grek and the people don 't think that creativity was to come from men , OK ?
It was thought that creativity was this spirit , and they come to the men from a few distant source and unknown , for some kind of distances and unknown , for reasons and unknown .
The green green 's called these spirites of creativity , " demons . "
Socrate , wonderful , he had to have a demon that held elargy from away away away away away .
The Roands were the same idea , but they called the the " spirit of the genius .
which is great , because the Roands didn 't really think a genius was somebody who was particularly smart .
And they have to be a genius was this kind of devine that has living in the murs of a artist , a little bit like the elpho Dobby , and that was indeed out of the ability of the argument of the artist and the result of that work .
Here 's the wildness -- here 's the distance of which parts -- that costructed psychological construction that you progave you from the result of your work .
And all they knew that was so that it was so that it was , right ?
So the anti-artists were protected by certain things , like for example , the way , so for example , not ?
If your work was exceptional , you couldn 't take everything all the despite , all of course they were helped to this genius .
If your work failed , it wasn 't all cold , it was not all cold , right ?
Everybody knew that was your genius to be a inable .
And so people han invest in Occient for a lot of time .
Then the Rinascition came and everything , and it 's going to change , and we put the human being on the center of the universe on the universe on the universe on the universe on the universe on the universe on the writing of the universe , and the wildness .
This was the human reporting reports and people started thinking that creativity was completely by the isse of the divided divided by the issue .
And for the first time in history , you start referirse to this or that artist as a genius rather than a person with genius .
And I have to say , I think it was a big error .
I think I lose somebody , a simple person to believe that that you can be as a recipient as a source , the essence and the surprising , creativity , unknown as a re-ability , creatible and etherical responsibility to the human psyc .
It 's how to ask someone to enjoy the sun .
It 's deform and destroy the ego and creates all these ingestishes on performance .
And I think it 's been this pressure to have destruction in the past 500 years .
And if this is true , and I think that 's the question to be , and now ?
Can we do it .
Maybe I get back to a more antical understanding of the relationship between humans and mystery creative .
Or maybe not .
Maybe we can 't cell 500 years of rational thinking in a 18 minutes .
And there 's probably people in the audience that would be the scientific subjects on the notion of scientific notion , you know , they follow people to the next people in their projects .
I 'm going to say you all about this .
But the question I 'd like to take is -- why no ?
Why don 't I think that way ?
Because it 's more sense of anything that ever ever ever heard to explain the imprevision of the process of creative process .
A process that , as anyone who ever did do something -- so , basically , basically , all here -- you know , you know , you don 't get ratic .
And in fact , it can be completely paranormous .
I did this indict with the extraordinary Ruth Stone , who has 90 years , but it was a poeter for all life and said that during his childhood in the rural Virginia , working out in the rural Virginia , working out in the camps , and he was working out of the way .
He said he was like a fragy of the air .
And it was reaching to her from the landscape .
He heard it , because he had to be able to get the Earth under his feet .
He knew that point to have one thing to do with that point and he was , his words , " run as a math . "
And so he goes back to home and it was infollowed by this poem , and it would not have to get a piece of paper and a cymb enough , and the trapassing , and the trapon the page .
And then you could not be fast , so it was so correcrect and correcreceive and correcreceive and the poem and the poem and she would continue to the ropolar through the landscape , looking for , as she said , " another poet . "
And then there were those times -- this piece never dimentiches -- there were the moments where the was almost lossing , OK ?
So , she was running home and she was trying to the poem and he was trying to make a math in the while she was walking , and then he was how if you go to go to the end and then he was how if you go to the hold and the step .
Acctued the poem from and remain his body and remain his body and transcrossing on the page .
And in these cases , the poem would be presented on the perfect page and intact but the contrast , from the last word to the first .
So when I heard about you -- it 's just a landscape , it 's exactly the equal to my creative process .
Not all my creative process -- I 'm not a construct !
I 'm a mule , and my way to work is ; you know , I 'm going to get up to the same orary every day and work and I 'm going to work and go on on the goal .
But even I 've been a little bit , I 've been brought against that thing , sometimes .
And I guess that many of you have han han .
You know , even though the work and ideas came to me from a certain source , you know , I could be able ,
And what is this ?
And how can we relate to it in a way to do not make it perhaps , but rather , rather , what do you do you do it ?
For me , the best example , the best example I have is the musician Tom Waits , which I 've interviewed different years ago for a newspaper .
We were talking about this , and you know , Tom , for the majority of life has been the incarnation of the incarnation of the time , trying to control , to dominate , to cause these species of impults .
But then I 'm going to inveced , and a day , and a day while she was driving on a street in Los Angeles , changed everything for him .
He was going to be fast and everything from a check . This little fragement of melodia , which comes in his head as a cheap , and the wild , and it 's wonderful , and the desider , and the desider , but it 's wonderful , and the desidst , but it 's wonderful , and the desider , but it 's not how to take it .
It 's not a piece of paper , it doesn 't have a math registrator .
So I started to hear this kind of old old old old old , " I 'm going to lose , and I 'm going to lose , and I 'm going to lose , and I 'm going to lose .
I 'm not good enough , and I can 't make it . "
And instead of going to go into the panic ,
I 'm going to get the whole process and he did something completely new .
I 'm just just going to go and he said , " Scuses , I 'm not driving ? "
" Do you think that 's going to write a song ?
If you really want to exist , you 're going to be a little bit more opporting .
On the wish , you go to importantly qualcause another today .
I went to disturbing Leonard Cohen . "
And his process working on this .
It wasn 't work , the work was still dark .
But the process , and the fish that was require that was releave when he took the genius , the genius that 's out of him , the genius that was remain the other and remain the way , and it was remain the way , and realized that it didn 't have to be a interiorized and remaining .
But I well-blink , wonderful bizarra collaboration between Tom and this strange and the outside Tom and this strange and outside Tom and .
So how the story was going to change a little bit even the way I was working and I was already , and I was already , and I had a time .
This idea , I was writing , I was write , " Mangia , Prua , " and a cadvice of those cave of the disperation that we 're working on something and we 're working on something and we 're working on something and we 're working on a disaster , which is the worst book .
Not only good , just the worst book written .
And I started to think about this this project .
But then I reminded me of Tom I talked about the air and I tried .
So I went down my face on the gave and I was my common and reached my common , and my common ,
And I said to get voices , " Sents , what , you 're going to be a brilliant is not going to be a brilliant , not going to be a brilliant ,
Because as I see you know , I 'm going to put it all I have , I don 't have this .
So if you want to be better , you have to show you and do your part .
OK . But if you don 't do it , I know what , I don 't do it .
I 'm going to write the same because it 's my work .
And I 'd like to favor that was recorded that I 've been presented to do my part , " Because -- in the end is so , OK -- -- sorts of people were rouned for the dancy of the North people who were rounded for the dancy and the music that went on and forth .
And they were always magnify , because the ballerines were professionists and they were great .
But every time , rarely , something happened , and one of these artists had become a transcendent reality .
And I know what you know , because I know you 've all seen , at a point , a performance so .
It was like if the time , and the ballerine walked through a kind of land-walk through a land-up and it was not doing anything different from the solar , but everything was all all of them .
And suddenly , I don 't look like a human .
But it 's accese from the divinity of the divinity of the divinity .
And when this happened , the time , the people knew what was , they called him .
They were going to be able to doctor , " Allah , Allah , Allah , God , God , God , God , God , God , " God , God , " God , "
That 's God , you know .
Curious note -- when the Minvaded Middle I was this abitude with them and the soouth of changes in the seuh , " Alah , " " " " " " " " " " Ole , " " " " " " " " " " Ole , " " " You can still hear in the corries or the flams of . "
In Spaign , when a artist did something impossible and magic , " Allah , " Allah , " By , " " " By , " incompreed , it 's a last thing -- a last thing .
And it 's great because we need .
But the problem comes back , the problem comes back , for the ballerine , when you svehle and discover that are 11 in Martedouble and the last thing is not more .
It 's just a mortal with gran evil to the ginock , and maybe never will never get to get to that altel .
And maybe nobody will you have the name of God still , and what do you have to do with the rest of his life ?
It 's hard .
This is one of the most paorous recognize to make a life .
But maybe it doesn 't have to be so angoal if you can 't believe , and more extraordinary expect of your being from you .
But you might just say you get to you in prestied by a source of this team that you have to go into something else when you finished .
And , you know , if we think about this all changes .
And so I started thinking about , and it 's sure it 's how I thought for different months during the work that I 'm going to be able to be , the dangerous , attesissively , the attesissue , the dangerous , the attesion .
And what I have to continue to say when I feel electritried by this is , it 's not not to do .
It 's not just on your work . It 's just your work .
Continua presentation to your part , any can be .
If your work is bally , bally .
If the devine , it 's assurd on you decided to leave some kind of wonderful , for a moment through the inforce , then " Ole ! "
To you , you 're going to the same dance .
And " Ole ! " You know , " You know , "
I think , and I think , I think , I think , I think , I think , I think , I think , and I think , I have to teach it .
" Ole ! " You know , just for you , even for the human love and testing tali tals from the tals that are going to be continuously .
Thank you .
Thank you .
June Cohen : Ole !
As you know , I 've already talked about some of these projects on the human genome , what can mean and the discovery of genes .
We 're starting a new persum : we started digitalize biology and now we started to digital code , we 're coming into a new biology , designing and synthizyellow life .
We 've always been trying to take a big questions .
" What is the life ? " It 's something that many biological biologists I think have been trying to understand vary vary .
We 've tried different approaches , reduced to the minimum .
We 're digitalizing from almost 20 years ,
When we sequenced the human genome was treated to go from analome of the world of the digital world .
Now , we can we get to , how can we regenerate life , or to create new life from this digital universe ?
This is the map of a small organism , Mycoplasma genitalium , which is the species from the small genome between those who can authored in the lab .
And we tried to reduce the genome for creating a little bit more .
We 're able to eliminate a hundred genes of about 500 that are here .
But when we look at his metabolic map , it 's relatively simple respect to our .
I think , this is simple .
But when we look at all the genes we can get , one at the time , it 's very unimprobable that this can bring a living cells .
So we decided that the only way we decided to be intectual to provide this chromosoma , so we decided to get the components to bring some of these fundamental questions .
And so we started the adventure of the " Can we can synthize a chromosoma ? "
Can you realize that chemistry to produce these big molecules that we never have been able to create before ?
And , in case , we can make a chromosoma ?
A chromosoma is just a piece of chemistry ,
The speed that we 're able to digitalize life is growing to requency .
Our capacity to write genetic code , instead , progree rather , but it 's better .
And our recently revolution the reports on a curve .
We 've got over 15 years ago .
The process has require many spaces , starting with a bioetic reports before we started the first experiments .
But we 've discovered that synthize DNA is very difficult .
There are a few thousands of machines in the world that produce small segments of DNA , the long falls of DNA , and it 's a degenerative process : the most eral segment is , more errors .
So we had to develop a new method to assemble these fragments and correcrecreceive errors .
And this was our first tation-, to start by digital information of the genome of the genome of the X 174 .
It 's a little virus that kills .
We designed the framments , we 've designed the correction of the errors and get a molecule of about 5,000 lecks .
The interesting part is when we took this this piece of chemical chemical material , and we 've insered in bacteria , the batteries have started to read this genetic code and proud the viral particles .
The viral particles have been require by cells , they 're back and come back and they 've come back and they destroyed the E.
I 've been talking about recent recently with the oil industry , and they say that they have certainly understood this model .
They have more than you .
We think this is a situation where the software can actually build his hardware in a biological system .
But we wanted to do things in the big .
We wanted to build the whole chromosoma .
I 'm over 580 mile in genetic code .
So we 've thought of building it in the size of the virus , so we can change the cassets , so we can change the cassets of a living cells .
The designing is crucial , and if we began with digital information in a computer , these must be very accurate .
When we sequenced this genome for the first time in 1995 accurate accurate was a sum of a mile for every 10 mile .
We found , we 've discovered , 30 errors . If we had the original sequence never been able to do it work .
One part of the process is designing 50 land-up s-leck , which is designed with all the other than 50 lecting to build underneath the little little work together .
We try to the elements here .
You 've probably probably read that we 're going to be a lot of the filigrade .
Think about this : We have a genetic code on four letters : British , Gs and T.
Three of those letters together codified about 20 friend , and there 's a specific order to spring for every friend of the lecket .
So we can use the genetic code to write words , frases , thoughts .
What we 've done this is autograped .
Some have been deluss from the fact that it wasn 't poem .
We designed these segments to just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just to just just just just to just just just just just to just just just just just to just just just just a deal with the above .
There are a lesss that they repect them .
And we started assemble with segments , starting with segments from five to seven mile the lectured , and it 's a way to form the segments of 24 mile , and it 's going to get to 72 mile .
And we 've got these segments in abundance , so we 're trying to build a very very quickly sequencing we 're trying to create a very very very robustowned , as you 'll see in a minute .
We 're trying to automatize the process .
So this seems , this seems the tabellon a board board .
When we get these very long , the most of 100 miles , more than 100 miles , they 're not going to grow up in E.
It comes to the limits of modern biology .
So we 've been considered other mechanisms .
We knew another mechanism called the omologa called omologa , which in biology , in biology , and in biology to repair the segments .
Here 's an example .
This organism , called the Deinococture , it can absorping three million rad rad .
You can see the sound square like his chromosoma is destroyed .
In 12 -- 24 hours is replaced up exactly how it was before .
There are thousands of organisms that are able to do it .
These organisms can sit completely .
They can live under vacuum .
It 's absolutely sure that life is in space , and you feel sears to find new environments of water .
And the real , NASA showed you that this is .
This is a picture of molecule we 've built using these processed , just using the livesting with design to open up with design to open .
The lievision is assemble .
This image is not taken with a microscope , but with a microscope , but with a microscope .
It 's a molecule we can see the whole with a microscope with a slide microscope .
These are pictures that covered a time of about six seconds .
This is the advertising that we 've done a little time ago .
I 'm over 580,000 lectural code .
It 's the largest molecule of a defined structure that we 've ever been on a man .
It 's got a lot of molecular weight to 300 million .
If you 're going to stamp 10 without spaces , you would like 142 page , it would like 142 page to transcending this genetic code .
Now , how do we do it work ?
Of course , a virus is a game from kids .
It 's a little bit more complicated when they use bacteria .
It 's simply simple when it 's about cells as it 's our : you can just be the nucleo and put it up to a nucleo and put another , which is basically the process of clonation .
In the archaaine , it 's instead of integrated inside the cells , but we 've recently demonstrated that we are able to do a complex cell a cell cell from one one cells to another and activate .
We 've got a chromosoma by a game , and we 've got a microbial species .
The two are different as the men from the topes .
We 've added some gene in the way , we can decide what to this chromosom .
The then he sciold with the enjomes to kill all the property .
And when we put it into the cells was study -- and you will appreciate our graphics , the new chromom was going inside the cell .
And we were actually thought we couldn 't go beyond , but we 've got so far on the way .
This is one of the major mechanisms of evolution .
We found that a lot of species have added a second or chromosoma from some part , add in a thousand new tracts in a second thousand new tracts in a second thousand new tracts in a second , or a crumosoma , and we 've got that a little bit of a second or a crumosome of the crumosoma .
So who think about evolution as a gene and it doesn 't understand a gene and it doesn 't understand a lot of a cycle of biology .
They 're going to be the world called " " " " It 's a restription that advice digit .
The chromosoma that was in the cells isn 't possible one .
The cellula--chromosoma we 've got to ----cell .
It 's expressed , and it recognized the other chromosoma as as a material material , and we 've got a cell , and we 've got a cell and the new chromosome .
It has become blue blue because of the genes we 've insered .
And in a short leep , all the characteristics of a species , I went to lose , and it 's transformed of all , a new species , based on the new software that we 've insered in cells .
All the providing property , the membranane has changed , and when we read the genetic code , exactly how we have we transfit .
Now , this may look at genetic genetic , but altering software , we can change things in manipulation , we can change things in a funcy enough .
Now , I 've already explained that here is not about geny -- but of progress from progress , and I 've already said that maybe we 're going to create a new version of Cambrian exhilosion in which will be a new species of Cambrian extensive process that will be a new species on this digital process .
Why do that ?
I think it 's enough obvious when we think about our need .
We 're going to go from six billion and a half billion people in the next 40 years .
Right to give an example : I was born in 1946 .
Now there are three people on the planet for each of the Earth in 1946 ; it 's going to be four .
We 're having problems now to find food , water and a medical medical and medical medical and well-to-half billion people .
It 's going to be more double to do it for nine billion .
We 're going to use more five billion carbon , more than 30 billion baries , more than 30 billion baries .
That means a million baries a day .
When we try to find biological processing , or any kind of process to reach them , it 's going to be a huge challenge .
We have to keep the whole of CO2 from these materials that 's going to end in the atmosphere .
At today , thank you to the scientific discoveries in all the world , we have a database with about 20 million genes , and I like to think they are designed for the future .
The electronics is only a dozen of about components , and think about how many different things are coming out .
Our limitations here are principles of the biological reality and our imagination .
Now we have a techniques , thank you very quickly , we 're able to create what we call genomics .
We 're able to build a big robot that can produce a million crumosomes a day .
Think about these 20 million genes or trying to get these 20 million different genes or to try to get the processing , and we can change , we can change , thank you , we can change , thank you very much , with a small team , and create molecular biology now that in the last 20 years of science .
And it 's just a standard selection .
We can choose for the possibility of survival , or fuel production or carbon , production of vaccines .
This is an instantly instantly of some software programs that we 're working for being able to be able to make it and designing species .
Well , we don 't know how they 're going to be .
We know exactly how it is their genetic code .
We 're now focusing on the fourth generation .
You 've seen you that extract from gram was a finished experiment .
We have carbon on the top and third generation that will use enough enough to the sleep , and the higher of the highest value as the either either , or different kinds of butanol .
But the only way the biology can have a big impact without increasing more more than the cost of food and limitarne the cost of food and limitarne the wildlife , which we 're working on the process that we 're working for designing cells that can reach this , and we can get the first carbon .
The solar solar light with CO2 is a metodo-- but in our discovered , we 've found different metowners .
This is a organism we 've described in 1996 .
It 's going to be in the deep ocean , about 2,500 feet of the temperature of water .
And they create a metan from CO2 molecular idrogen molecular as source .
We 're trying to understand if we can inchance CO2 , which can be translated to tramite , you can make that CO2 in carbon , to drive this process .
So , we short think we could be able to increase what life is , we could be able to increase the question , " which is Noi , veramentally , we have the worth goal of the bottom of the oil industry .
Exxactly . If you don 't do it from TED , where you can you ?
It would be a main energy source .
And we 're working on the same methods to make the same methods to create vaccines .
You 've seen this year with influence , we 're always going back to a year and a dollar in less when it 's to find the wine .
I think what you can change build a combinable vaccines in anticipate .
So this is how the future may start looking at the future , now , the trees of evolution , accellerating evolution with batteries , which is , which indeed the cell , which income cells .
We 're so far from improve people .
Our purpose is to do it in a way of living enough to try to make it . Thank you very much . Thank you very much .
First of all I 'll show you , the faster , the faster , the new technology we 've brought to the Microsoft in the follow , a year ago . This is Seadragon . This is Seadragon .
It 's a environment where you can interact is to the local level that remote with a huge amount of visual data .
So here we 're seeing a lot of gabyte digital with a kind of phoom , with a kind of a zoom , and continuum , for a fast , we 're going to be able to do .
And it 's not how much much much much the amount of information we see , how big these things are big these things .
Most are common photographs , but this for example is a property scansion , but this is a death from the Bioteca , and reenter in the gamel of 300 megapile .
It 's not a difference because the only thing that limit of a system like this is the number of pixel on your screen in any time . It 's also an architecture very flexible architecture .
This is a book , this is a book , example of the data not images .
This is Casa desolate Dickens . Every colonna represents a capital .
So , I show you that 's just about the text and not images , we can do something like that , to make a real real representation of the text of the text , not a picture .
It could be a way a little artificial to read a electronic book .
It 's not a advice .
This is an example of the most realistic example . It 's a number of of the Guardian .
Every picture is the beginning of a sexual .
And it really gives you the pleasure and the beautiful experience to read the version of a magazine , or a quotie , which is for nature , a mold of a a kind of a half .
We also did something with the corner of this particular number of of the Woman .
We created a bunch of a high-solution-solutionary advertising -- and more alone that you use in a normal advertising content .
If you want to see the carlay of this automobile , you can see here .
Or other models , or even the specific techniques .
And this really shows some of these ideas to eliminate the limits of space on the screen .
We hope that this means to you end to the pop-up and other porcheries , you don 't have to be necessary .
Of course , the map is one of the most obvious applications for this kind of technology .
And I don 't want to lose time , if we don 't say we have contribute to give them in this field .
These are all the streets in the United States , there 's a geospy-called the NASA .
So now we go to something else .
This is actually actually what 's actually from the right right right now , you can go to see it .
It 's a project called Photosynth , which combine two different technologies .
One is Seadragon and the other is a very interesting computer computer computer computer , which is a very interesting computer visual , a student of the University of Washington , with helps of the UW Seitz of UW Szeliski Rick Szeliski . " A cool collaboration . "
And it 's from the Weadragon , I 've got to Seadragon .
You can see it when we do this types of screen , where we can go from one image and have this kind of experience to the other and have this kind of experience to the last path .
But the space collocation of images here has actually a meaning .
The algorithms of visualization computer have registrated these images together , so that corresponding to places where the imagine , so that I think -- all the nearly , you know , you 're going to the slegs on Montagne Rococcious downnests -- they 've got a little bit of a demonstring , and these things are all the time in the space , and these things are all the time in space .
I don 't know if I have a few other environment .
And there are some more space .
I want to go directly to one of Noah-- and this is from a precedent prototyping of Photosynth we 've done for the first time , to show you what I think about the first time , to show you what I think is really the key key key to show you what I think is really the key key key to the environments that we have put in the website . And it 's not necessarily observing ,
We had to worry about the legal expectations and forth and said .
This is a re-built of Notre Dame pictures of Notre Dame pictures , Basta digitites , Noth Dame , and you get images of types , other campus and you get pictures of these coni coni , the other campus , and it 's discovered . Ogning of these two consequence represent of a picture that 's re-deal to be the model .
So they 're all taken from Flickr and they 've got all the space in this way .
And it 's possible to be able to be able to be very simple .
You know , I 'd never thought to end to go to work for Microsoft .
It 's very gratificent reporting this kind of accooking here .
I think you can see that it 's a lot of different types of focus : from those of the cell phone , which is a meaning , a meaning , put together in this environment .
And if I can , I try to try to look at those strange .
Many of them are blown from the ground , etc .
So , somewhere here is a series of photographs -- it cole .
This is a poster of Notre Dame registrated correctly .
We can go from the poster to the physical view of this environment .
The essential point is we can do with social environment . This is now is now take data from the whole memory of the whole memory of the collective memory of how to be going to be a visual view -- and link to all those data together .
All those pictures become linked together , the main of parts .
You have a model of the Earth 's emerged .
Think about this as a prolungation of Stephen Lawler on Earth .
It 's something that grows in complexity as a lot of people use it , and the advantage for who are to use it .
Their pictures are marcated with meaning from other people .
If somebody comes a sense of contrast to each other , and I can use these sandandweld the name , my picture of Noth Dame improved arricks of all those data , and I can use how to use it as a point of inresults , and I can use how to get a picture of a cross-modly , using the photo-moon and cross--modent design .
Of course , a consequence of everything is , the virtual models of the extremely reported of all interesting in the Earth , collecting not just to you 're going to be able to the plane and similar images , but from the memory memory .
Milles thank you .
CA : I realized , well ? What your software is you know ? What your software is that to do is that , in the next years , all the photographs , all the photographs will be practically link by anyone in the world will be practice together ?
BAA : Yeah . What 's doing is doing it is to find .
It 's creating hyperlink , if you want , you go , between images .
And it 's doing it in the content of images .
And the thing is really interesting if you think about recheating information of semanties that many of these images are .
As when you do a research on the web , you have a phrase and the text on the web page , a lot of information about the pictures .
Now , what is going on if that picture you link all the pictures ?
So the amount of interconnection and the amount of rcheese and the amount of rcheese , which is really enormous classical classical classic effect of the network .
CA : Blaise , it 's really incredible . Compice .
BAA : I thank you very much .
One of the main pleasure when you travel and one of the dollar research is the way to live in who has no mentymented the anti-tradied , between who 's going to be the wind , the tomb , the top in the wind , the wind the wind , the shelelt in the wind and the piogs , the levering of the plants , the levers of the wind and the leversus .
Basti thinking that sciousness , Jaguar vidamans still over the Via Lattea , or that the monites are still collied with meaning , or that in Himalaya , the budddists in the Can Dharm , but it 's a reminute of the central anthropology , and the idea that the world 's the way we live not existe and in the world , but it 's only a model of reality , but it 's just a model ,
the consequence of a particular particular set of choices that our styrpe has done , well , a lot of generations ago .
And of course , we all share of the essential tracts .
We all have the nose . We all do .
We 're underlying to recognize .
We have to death the inexorability of death , so we don 't surprise if we 're going to sleep and --
We all have an art .
What you want is the particular rithythm of the song , the rethrow of dance .
It 's not the same same as the Penan forest of Borneo , or the West , or the Wewish , or the guerribs of the desert Kaisut in Kaisut Kenya , or a Sahara .
He was my journey in the desert a month ago , or a al-flight bone-release of the values of Qomold , the deal mother of the world .
All these populations teachers have other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , other ways of moving in the world .
And if you reflect a moment , it 's a concept that it can give you hope .
And then , the myriads of cultures of the world creating a life of spiritual and cultural life that 's important for the planet and it 's important for the well-being like the neverversus .
And you can think about this cultural ragnonosphere , and you can defining the etnosphere , and you can call the etnosphere , the whole whole concepts , intuitions , intuition , intuition , intuition , the ideas , intuition , the ideas , intuition ,
The etnosphere is the wonderful pathage of humanity .
It 's the symbbox of what we are and what we can be as as a species .
And as biosphere was gravly consumption has been very , very quickly , it 's success to the etnosphere , and it too quickly .
Nobody biological , for example , would say that 50 percent of all the species was or is on the organ simply , because it 's a fast , or the pocalitter of the field of biological diversity -- and in the field of biological diversity -- and it 's not near to the hypothesckly -- that 's the most optimistic -- that 's the most optively ,
The indeed of this is , of course , the language loss .
When you 're born 6,000 languages on this planet .
A language is not only composed by a vocabolary or a series of rules or a series of rules .
A language is the shrap of human spirit .
It 's the half the animal , which the animal comes in the world .
Every language is a forest , a forest , a thought , a thought , a thought , a thought , a thought , a thought , a thought of the spiritual .
And of those 6,000 language , as we are here in Monterey , at least half the half of them is not more sounsurred in the orecchie orchie kids .
It 's not teaching kids , the which means that , not the sorts of things , which are already death .
What is the most triad of being having fly from the silence , the last to talk about a language , the way to talk about a language , not to get the wisdom of the saggey of the kids ?
This is a few weeks , it 's the state of someone in the world every two weeks , a first weeks , and a fund , and it 's a old language and a door , a language of ancient language .
And I know somebody who 's not better ?
Where would be not a better place if we 're talking about all the same language ? " Well , then we all talk about yoruba . And we 're talking to yoruba . And we 're going to dotone-on-speak .
We talk about kogi .
You 'll cost a trackage , what it means we can 't talk about your language .
I 'd like to do a journey through the etnosphere --
a small journey in the etnosphere to give you a gave you a stage of what we 're losing .
Many of us deal that when I say , " different ways of exists , " It 's really different ways of exists .
We make example of this bimbo Barasan , in Amazonia , the popular popular , the popular popular anacond , which creates at the weird of the latte of the sacond of the sacond of the sacond of sacond .
It 's a popular popular that it 's not able to distinguess the bllue blue from the green because the time you get identified in the forest , which depends the population .
They have a strange language and a drule , called " examia language , " " You have to tell you a person who 's a different language that talk about a different language .
So it 's all this has been in the mythology , yet the party is that in these families and extended in these families , which are in these families ,
They limitate to listening and then start talking about .
We make one of the most interests in the most interests that I 've lived , the Waorans of East On East , an incredible popular that has been contact in 1958 .
In 1957 , the missionary , they 've been trying to get a deal .
They had to get up from the top photographs that they were rerained that rerainted , and forest that this popular , and forest that this popular , had never seen anything bi-dimensional .
They 've got to collected the picture from Earth , they 've got to research a shape or a shape and , not found anything , they 've been going to be treated that they were treated at five missionary , and they killed the five missionary with the lance .
But Waorans not only kill the souls .
They killed to them between them .
54 percent of the mortality was caused by their same .
We 've got eight generations and we found two of natural morning and we found two natural cases and when we 've been sitting that one of them was invectured so they were invecently invecchiating , and then they had killed him him him him the same . [ Risate ] Aevery way , had an incredible forest .
The crugs were able to recognize the animal from 40 steps and recognize the species .
In the early ' 80s , I 've been assigned a very interesting understanding when my professor , I was going to go to Haiti to the maining society , I 'd like to go to Haiti to the society of Duvalier and Tonton Macope , and I imposition of the vehicles to make the zombie .
For a sense of a miracle , I would have to understand the Vodoo culture , I would have to understand the Voodoo is not magnine .
It 's quite a complex view of the world .
Many interesting .
If I asked you to say , the big religions of the world , what would you say ?
Cstianesimum , Islam , Buddism , Ebraism , Ebraism , etc .
A continent is always left out , thinking about the sub-Sharian not religious religious has not been religious . And instead of the Vodoo is not the other that the distilside of these religious religious religious concepts in the tragic tragic tragic .
What makes interesting is that makes the voodoo is the intended between life and death .
So the vision they 're going to be hide .
The spirits can be invoced by Grande Acqua , they response to the ritain of the dance and replace to the time for a very short , which for a short , the way that for a short moment , the following becomes the .
So , the voodoors love to say , " You 've got to talk about God .
We say , " We say , " We 're going to God . "
And from the moment you 're a posseat , is the spirit that you , how can you do you with evil ?
So you have these incredible events : follow the voodoo in the state of trance that touch impunts are , which touch impunred a very strong demonstration of the power of the mind when it 's catalized in a state of extreme .
And so all the popular with which I 've been the most extraordinary Kogi in Sierra Nevada Santa Marta , in the Santa Marta , in the Santa Marta ,
It was the advancement of the civilization that once once they were living on the caraibic plants of Colombia in the conquician , popular ritic plants that you were retreatment on the waste planture that you were retreatment on the wild caraibaibits .
In a continent drude blood , this popular was never conquisted by the double spagrees .
But there 's now now they 're governmented by a clero , but their formation is deciously incredible .
The young people following up from the families to three or four years , and living secreged in a world 's made of good and hombar in the bottom of the glacier for 18 years .
Two douth-noves years old choices to reproduce the noves months of the agement that transition in the the utter of the mother , now are metaphor the ushor the race .
So , this time , they 're accultured to values of their society , values that they predict their pice and only their prepice , they keep the cost of the cost of the cost of the cost of the ecological equilibrio .
The term of this incredible began , they 're improved out and for the first time in their life , at 18 years , they see a high age , and that 's a very consciousness of conscious , when the sun the sun , when the sun sun , the sun , the sun of the beautiful landscape , all that have learned in the theory is , all that they 've been learned in the theory . And the prepection is a step up and he 's saying ,
" Where ? Proprise how I said .
It 's study . Now it 's study you . "
They call it greater fraters and they say we , the minors , we are the colliphic , we are the collilim .
This level of intuition is extremely important .
When we think about the Ingence populations and the invote Rousseau and old old story of wildlife , which is a concept in his simplicity , which is a razen concept in its simplicity , and we love that these populations are close to the Earth .
The popular Ingenes are not feeling feeling .
There 's no space for these things in the Asmallat Asmallon , or the gelids of Tibet , but thank you to the time and rel , they created a mystics of Earth is not about the concept of the Earth is not about the concept of human consciousness .
What does it mean ?
And it 's going to say that a girl of the Ande that growing up that the mountain is a spirit , which will be a human being going to be a human being going to be a human being going to have a very different human being going to have a very different phip with the mountains or the place that it 's a mountains is a massive human being a massed massive massive human .
That 's the demnow of a spirit or a mineral cute is irrievant .
What 's interesting is is the metaphor that defines the relationship between the individual and the natural world .
I grew up in the forests of Columbia credying that forested forested to be cut .
And this has a human being different from my friends Kwakiutl that believe the forest is that the forest is the deal of Huk and the blow blow of the paradise and the bal donibal cannibs that live in the world , the spirits that we 're going to be in the Hamatsa .
If you start looking at these cultures , you can start making different reality , you can start to understand some their feeds , you can start to understand some sense of their sensory sense .
I 've taken this picture to open up to the West Amazonia .
Maybe some of you 've heard about the ayahuash , the most powerful psycoat the glasanic repertoire .
What makes fascinating the ayahuash is not the potential to the major check , but his elaboration . It 's composed to two elements .
From one side , this lian lawy-carbs , the harm and harm , harm and harmful , slightly slemolines , and it 's going to be sleep .
Take the only plants has a fibluster that altera little bit of the consciousness , but it 's mychoice with the fleaves of a family of coffee Psychochoo .
This plants fleaving tripptamines , very similar to serotonine , dimethyl-in-5 , methoxyptamine .
If you 've ever see Yanoms on the nose that they do a different set of species , which is a different species , anchis contained methoxyptamine .
And I mean that polve on the nose is a little bit like to be sparked by a wild paper , and it 's a depink of the gycle , and it 's not creates a destaff of reality . It 's not creates a destainable destaff of reality .
I was often going to get with my professor , Richard Evan Shultes , the man who has been psychedelic , with his discovery of the fungi of the fungi of the load funcy , in Mexico .
I think my teeth is not going to classificate these tripptamines as as well as if you 're not going to tell nobody to be hallucinated . " He said , " The trippamine , but they can 't be any sunded by the sorts of course , because they 're dened by a maintain , the monooxygen .
It 's possible to be absolutely only if you get assume with other checical chemical checks that dens us .
Now it 's the beautiful : The Is that they find in this lian 80,000 species , are initial instruments . The same kind of need to potential to potential the tripptamine . The question of the question is , in a flour fle-wind , how they have two deal of plants , how they have these popular , how if you combination in this way , they create a version , how if you can do that , is the sorts of the sorts of the sorts of parts ?
We use the great eupermism of the prove and the error the error the error the error reveal .
But if we ask the Indians , they 'll say , " The plants will talk about it . "
What does it mean ?
This tribes , the Cofan , has 17 variety of ayahuash , which distinguess , which is a little bit of the forest , and that 's our eyes would come in in the forest .
If we asked them how to stabilize their tassonoms will say , " I was thinking about the rest , of the rest , of the rest , " I said , " No . "
The solution is : You take the 17 variety of the moon , and each of a piena and each of a little bit of a different .
So , this is not a laurea in Harvard , but it 's much more interesting that you count the stage .
Now , [ applaushes the problem is that the people who have to heart popular ingenes have been pittoresks , but somehow reducts to the margines of the history of the history of the history of our real world , and pass over .
In fact , the 19th century , between 300 years , it 's not going to reminded for his guerre or technologies , but rather as the was where we stopped and we 're going to habled and the passively destruction of massive diversity and cultural destruction of the planet . Now , it 's not the change .
All the cultures through the sears have been involved in a dance for new possibility .
And the problem is not technology .
The Indians Sioux have no stopped to be Sioux when they put up in the arc and they 're so as American American American have no stopped in the heat and calm .
It 's not the change or technology that 's going to be minded the etnosphere . It 's the power .
The hard or fly fly .
And if you give a look at the world , I 'll find that these are not destinated cultures .
They 're living and living dynamic dynamic , which is the identify of the forces that will go beyond their skills .
I know , I 'm a trackage in the paper of Penan --
a popular no-made of Sarawak , in the West , a popular popular that has librought into the forest to a generation , and now reduced to the servitus and now reduced to the reforest , where you can see the fiume , where you can see the fiume , where you can see the fiume , where the soul of the lighty Meridional Cinese , where the sought the Once the orizonto the orizon ,
You know , I 'm going to reempize the forest .
Or , in the case of Yanomami , are the disease that I got to the first payer .
If we 're going to move on the Tibet , where I 'm doing a lot of research , you 'll see the hard hard to the political domination .
As you know the genocide , the physical extens of a popular popular , but the ethnocide , the destruction of life , not just is not just not just a popular popular , but it 's not just a constructed , but it 's not just a construct , but it 's a part of development .
And you can 't understand the suffering of Tibet until it 's part of the beginning .
I 've been persudu in Chengdu in China through Tibet , through Tibet , and it 's in Lhasa with a young young link , but only came to Lhasa young link , but only came to Lhasa , I realized what we 're behind .
6,000 monuments reduced in polust and cenjoy .
1.2 million people killed by the millions of people killed by the Cultural Rivolution .
The father of this guy was ascritical to the Panchen Lama .
which means that it 's been killed to the temple of the Chinese invasion .
I 'm worst with Santity Santity during the diaspora that has brought the popular in Nepal .
SSit was a mother and he was impried and his cold was recognized .
It was brought to the age of two years double deal with the age of two years double deal with him because it would have no one of him .
The sister , who did the same , it was mitted in reducation .
A day has indeed with a window , a writing Mao and , for this transgression , it was mitted to the work for seven years .
The pain of Tibet can be inspiried , but the spirit of the popular is from the present .
And the end , all you reduce to a choice .
We want to live in the world world world 's the monooony or we want to account the world polycles of diversity ?
The big anthropologists , before he died to die said that his largest was that , in our own own largest pech , in our view , not only we 'll see the whole gm of human imagination , not only we 'll see the whole gams of human imagery , but a day we 're going to sleep to a modry from a sleep , and we 're going to be other possibility .
And it 's a million of reminate that our species is existed for 600,000 years .
The Rivolution Neolitic , who gave the agriculture , which has done us underneath the seme , which has been able to fight the poetry of the sm of the clero , creating the gerarchia gave of the clero , and we have 10,000 years ago .
The modern world industrialized has been 300 years .
That 's a story , I 'm not suggested that we have the risis we 're going to all the challenges that we 're going to deal in the millennia to come .
When these myriads of cultures of the world is asked what humans is asked to be human , they 're going to be humans .
And it 's in these answers that we 're going to be what we are , a kind of conscious , which has to make a kind of a way that all the popular woods and all the yard can fioring . And there 's big movements .
I 've been taken this picture on the northern extremity of Baffin , when I went to the whaled of the whales with the Inuit , and this man , Olaya , he told me the wonderful story of his grandfather .
The downny is not always gentle with the Inuit and the ' 50s to stabilire our suits , we 've got them in colonies .
The grandfail to go .
The family , themelting for his life , she took it all the time , and all his attle , and all his attle .
You have to know that Inuit 's not the cold , they 're going to be the cold , they 're going to be .
The pattins of slegs in origin was made of fishing skin the skin pin paper .
The grandmother of this man didn 't have been intimistic or the library , or from the library or suffering .
It 's sgattaiolated , it 's calated the pantalone in the skin the skin and defocused in your hand . When I did I put it , the worked a lama .
It 's sprrated on the points of this caccess and when it came up , he was killed , he killed a dog .
It has taken the dog and created a brilaughed with the cassledge has created a sledge , has imbridge another dog and it 's disappeared on the banks , colteless , collim tellighting on .
We want to talk about cavarsela with nothing ? [ Risate ] . And this , in different ways , [ Applausi is the symble of the resilience of the population of the world 's popular Inuit and all the population of the world .
In the 1999 , 1999 , the downnets has redded the whole control of the total control of an area of territory of California and Texas mmitted .
It 's the new pain . It 's called Nunavut .
It 's a territory , they 're going to be all the time . They 're going to all the resources .
One of the splendied , as a natione-state can recognize with his popular .
And , to finish , I think it 's rather obvious at least in those remote , and realized that they don 't have to remote in these song of the planet , to make it not remote .
For someone 's home is a house .
They 're going to represent the human imagination that rised up to the temple . And for us all , the dreams of these kids , like the dreams , become part of our kids , become part of the geography of hope .
And so we go , we know , National Geographic we 're convince that politicians will never come to anything .
We believe that the polemies --
[ Applausi ] not persuasive , but we do we think stories can change the world , and maybe we are the best institution to tell stories of the world . Every month of our website . Every month of our website .
156 countries transmit the television .
Our revists are lets from millions of people .
Our work is to travel in the etnosphere to bring our audience in the world places that will go through the audience of how they 've gone to , and you hope , abbraced , the world will be able to the central reveal reveal reveal reveal , the world will be in diversity , and we need to find a life in a pluralist and we have to find a life in a pluraly---up and the world 's life in a life in a world and cultural world and we have to get the main life in the main life in the major or ,
which is the saggey of all the popular can contribute to our benefit .
Thank you .
I 'm going to talk about some things I 've written in this book that I hope you 've already heard and proverse to proverse some links , in case , you 're not born 't notice .
I want to start with what I call " the official dogma . "
The official dogma ?
The official dogma of all the West industrial society . The official dogma : " If we want to massive the well-being of our citizens , " The way to do it is like to do it is to massive freedom . "
The reason is , from a side , in fact that freedom is in itself a value , is pretious , is pretiful , essential for humans .
The other is in fact that if we are libers , every one of us can act to do everything that massive to do all that that massive our beneath , no one that we decided to our name .
The way to massive freedom is massive to get the choice .
More choices people have , more librought , and greater is their freedom , main , more , they 're their beneath .
This , I think , it 's so deeply rooted in the society that nobody would be able to put it into the society that nobody would be able to put it in the society that nobody would be able to put it in the society that nobody would be able to put it into the society that nobody would be able to put it into the society that nobody would be able to put it into the society that nobody would be able to put it in the society that nobody would be able to put it in the society .
And it 's also deeply rooted in our lives .
I 'm going to show you some examples of what the progress has done as possible .
This is my supermarket . It 's not particularly big .
I lose a simple note on the condition for inhorse .
In my supermarket there are 175 condition , without content 10 variety of the extrade and 12 aceters and 12 aceters that you can buy for the balsamic number of condition in the inct cause of the inct cyone of the 175 , which one of the 175 , the way you have a big degree .
Here 's the super-market .
And then you go to the stereo , the role of electronics to buy a stereo : Mayer , radio , piac , the lefer .
And in this single store , there 's a big number of electronics , there 's a big number of audio components .
We can make six million and a half million different combinations of the components that there are a nearly store .
You have to love you to admit that there is a lot of choice .
The camps : the world of communications .
Once , when I was a child , they could get all the services , to pat the wish , which was fornitable to pat the mom Bell .
It was going to have a phone , it didn 't buy it was buy .
A consequence of this , between the other , was that the telephone never made .
These temple are gone .
We have a nearly illimited variety of telephones , especially between the cellphone .
Here 's the cell phone .
My favorite is that in the middle , MP3 , cut ut out of the nose , and forced to the cryslabs for the brulele .
If you don 't have the store , you 've got a certain nearly , you 're going to be going to be .
And what happens to the end is that people go into the negots and make this question . And you know what is the answer is " No . "
It 's not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn 't face .
So , in other life that are much more importantly than the purpose of the same exhihihibition , the same extension of choices .
Axxxture : it 's not going on the United States that you go from the doctor and the doctor , and the doctor you need to do .
Instead , I go to the doctor , and the doctor says , " OK , we could do , and you know , " Again , " Again , " Are these benefits and these risks . What do you want to do ? "
You say , " Dotic , what I would you do ? "
And the doctor says , " He has these benefits and these risks , and B has these benefits and these benefits and these sources . "
" What do you want to do ? "
And you rebats , " Dotic , if she was me , what would you do ? "
And the doctor , " But I 'm not her . "
The result we call it " autonomy of maled maled , " expression that makes it look like a beautiful thing .
But it 's actually not a sandscape and responsibility to make decisions from someone who knows something , is the doctor , to someone else is not -- and so almost certainly , and so it 's not a lot of maled -- and so it 's not in the ideal condition to make decisions .
There 's a huge marketing of products , the direct of people like me and you , who if you think it 's no sense , because you think it 's no sense , because we can 't buy them .
But if we can 't buy them , why do they have public public public public icians ?
The answer is that they want to be a domorning we call the doctor to ask us to change the ret .
What 's so fundamental as it 's our identity is a question of choice , how you see this vignel , " We don 't want to forcce kids . Scease their smom to the right moment , " We don 't want to force the right now . " We need to invest .
And we can invent how many times we can get it .
That means that every morning , at the risk , you need to decide that kind of person want to be .
I spect to the family and marriage , a time the common , a common time , unhappy , because it was that there was a liked time , and it was that there was a worth possible .
The only real choice was with who , not when , and it 's not when , and it 's not not what do after .
And it 's really to play .
I 'm going to start very smart , and I do their 20 percent in less than a time .
And it 's not why they 're not not just a brilligent .
But why are I 'm impensierites , I would say , " I would you say , " I would you say , " What do you now ? "
" Do I have to think I 've got to think before or my career or to the career ? "
They 're interrogatives .
And they try to answer these questions , even though this implying not to be able to be able to do that , and I 'm not going to get a vote to my examamples .
And they have to do it . They 're important questions .
Now , the work : We are lucky , like Carl sottle , because technology allows us to work every day , every day , from every day , from every day , from every day , from every day , from the West .
And I 'm going to talk , there 's a angoline , and I 'm not going to tell anyone , where the WiFi works .
I don 't tell you , why I want to use it .
What does , this incredible freedom of choice we have about work ? It 's we have to continue , continuously , if we have to work or not .
We can go to see our son , the toy , with the mobile phone , with the mobile phone , Blackberry in the other , and the notebook , typically , on the ginock .
And even though I 'm all spent , every minute we see our son , we 're also asking , we 're also wondering , " Do I said to answer to this call ? "
" I have to answer this email ? I have to get to bozzle this letter ? "
And even when the answer is " no , this makes the experience of your children , very different from what it would be in other conditions .
So , from any part , we look at , small and big , things and life , life is a question of choice .
Of the world was this : Ovreal , there were some possibility , but it was a question of choice .
The world of today looks like this : The dilemma is , " Is it a positive thing , or negative ? "
The answer is Sweather .
We know , the positive lats we know , so I 'm going to talk about the negative .
This is all this choice , two effects negative effects on people .
The first , paradoxtively , is that it 's produced to talk about it .
With many options between which choose , it becomes very hard to do it .
I offer an example : a study study on the flap of payment .
A my colleague has had access to the data of Vand , the gigantic society of the source of pension , with about a million clients in 2,000 different company .
What she has discovered is that for every 10 solutions that are offer in more , the percentage of adesion of two percent .
With 50 sources , there 's 10 percent in least than adesions , there 's 10 percent in least , because ?
Because with 50 sources the glass , is maledly difficult to decide , and choice is remainly difficult to decide .
And I asked the tomorrow , and I asked the asked asked , and of course , I 'd never come .
You know , it doesn 't mean that these work from old old , they 're going to be for the dogs because they don 't have enough money , even though , it 's so ostics that allow the function of the work .
It 's not about it , they 're losing until five dollars for the year year from the datatory of work , which would be a real being wasted to be .
So the paralysis a consequence of having a lot of choices .
And I think it makes the world like this .
" And to finish , for the ethchup , " Do the maionese or major maionese ? "
You 'd get to take the right decision , if it 's for the eternity , right ?
You don 't want to choose the wrong wrong , and you know the wrong condition .
So this is the first effect . The second is that we can also have to avooid , and we 're less substed by the result of the result of how we were being on less options in the result of the result of the results that choose .
And this for different reasons .
One of these is that with many condition , which is that the altered , if you buy a , and it 's not easy to imagine that you could do a different choice that would be better . And what 's going on is that the alternative , you know , the alternative imagination , and the rediminute the rediminusion , and the rediminusion rediminate by the decision of the re-ince ,
And when it was a good decision .
The more choice there are , more easy displeased than any detail that is unsatic ,
And also , there 's what economists call it expensive opportunity .
Dan Gilbert has close very well stamap as the value we do to things that we do with the things that we 're the confront .
So , when there 's a lot of options , it 's easy to represent the characternative of the dot-weline , and being less subsatic , and being less subjective .
So , here 's an example . I know with all the people who are not New York .
But that 's what you probably think .
There 's this couple of the Hamptons .
A lussides .
Spiach . Ot-the day . It 's all about them . It 's all for them .
It 's not missing . But what he thinks is , " Well , maldaily , it 's Agottle . "
" All my neighbor in Manhattan . "
" I could talk about it just in front of you . "
And it 's going to talk about two weeks , which is losing -- every day -- every day -- the possibility of parking ,
The expensive opportunity to deminate the subddisfation for what we have , as as well , as a cell .
And the most are the options that we have to consider , the most of the characteristics will get to the opportunity .
Here 's another example .
This is a lot of things .
It 's about living now , and maybe a living slowly .
But the most important point is that anything you choice , you go to not do other .
The things we don 't get to attractive , that they can make less attractive what we do .
Third point : The growth of expectations .
I 've tried to my skin bought a new couple of jeans .
I 'm almost always jeans .
Once the jeans were just a typed , and they were discovered by besty , they were discovered , and just after I had a life and work with a lot of times , they started going to go well .
So I went to buy a couple of new when the old old was going , and I said , " I need a couple of jeans , this is my cut . "
The next next to me , " You want slim , what 's going to do , relationship , and it 's a friend ? "
Do you want to the cernist with the bottons ? " Stonebottles , " " Would you say ? "
" Look , "
" Seight them to go or strett ? Bil bla -- " Continured to elenjoy .
I was sorts , and after a little bit , I 'm going to say , " I want the guy that was the only guy who was , so for a day , so for a day , I triggling , and then I used to all the jeans , and then I used to use the near jeans , and I would have ever been .
It was the massive . I had a lot of the choice I had the best .
But I felt I was worst .
Why ? I wrote a whole book to understand it .
The reason I was worst is that with all that choice was that with my expectations were altime , the jeans had to be perfect .
I was at the beginning I was expectation . I didn 't expected anything except when it was just a type , but when I was viding 100 different , accidents , at least a kind of a little bit of a perfect .
What I had had to buy , but not perfect .
After you have paragoned what I was going to do with what I was sationed in confronted to expectations .
The add of options in life , it doesn 't take the expectations that these have respect to the excellence of the options of the same .
And this will will property , it 's also when the result is a good one .
Nobody in the world of marketing if it makes it .
Because if they knew , you know what I 'm talking about .
The truth looks more at this .
" He was better when it was worst , " The reason I was better when it was worst , it was worst , when it was worst , it was still possible to meet of the pleasure .
Ost , the world we live we live -- opulent citizes , industrialized citizens with expectancy , the massive massive that we can hope is that things to the altel of expectations .
You 've never been surprised as your expectations , because your expectations , my expectations , they 're ingantic .
The secret of happiness -- what you 're here -- is , " Britain expectations , " Yes , " Yes , " You want . "
I mean , a little biographic moment -- I 'm really sposed and my wife is really amazing .
I could not do it . I couldn 't do it .
But it 's not always a good thing .
And finally , a consequence of buy jeans that when there 's just that kind of jeans is that when you 're not satic , and ask you " Why ? "
" Who is responsible ? " " " " Where 's the answer is .
The world is the responsible . What could I do you ?
When there are hundred types of jeans , and buy a nursatic insodatic , and ask you who is the responsible , is altreatment that the responsible you .
You could do better .
With hundreds of variety of variety of variety , there 's no scapes , it 's not going to be a crossing .
So when people take decisions , even though the result is , you know , they 're going to feel unsatic and they 're going to dry and they 're going to get the colp to their same .
In the last years , the depression is explose in the world industry .
I think a meaning that a meaningful factor -- not the only -- of this depression is that people have been too alt .
And when they have to explain this situation , they think the cold is they .
So the final result is that in general , we 're going to be better , objectively , but we feel worse .
Let me remember you .
This is the official dogma , what we all take for good and it 's completely fleave . It 's not true .
There 's no doubt that a little bit of choice is better than not to have a business , but it 's not better than a little bit .
There 's a critical value , magic . I don 't know what it 's .
But I 'm sure we 've been a piece that we 've super--scale that the level that choices our life .
Now , from the political view -- I 've almost finished -- from the point of political view , the nocction is the follow .
What it allows this together in the industrial society is the rickness of material .
There are many places in the world , and you know , you know , where the problem is not that they have been so much choice .
The problem is that they have too long .
So the factory I 'm talking about is a malal maleling of modern , rich society , rich society , rich society .
And what it does to depress and arrheavitt is this : Steve Levitt you talked about how those expensive and discovered for bimbi and discovered . It 's a spite of money . It 's a spent of money .
I mean these choices , complicated and avoid , it 's not just inuseful .
I 'm add deleteries .
And they 're worst .
If a little bit of what our society in our society allows you to have a reversed in those where people have too few possibility , it would not only be their life to improve , but also it 's our life .
This is what economists call a very paretian improve .
A distribution of redistribtion is all -- not only to the poor -- because of this choice of this , excess that we get us .
And so I 'm going to end , " You can become everything you want to --
You , people , you think , " But what does that fish ? "
" It 's obvious you can 't get anything in a glass of glass . "
" A castrated , a limited view of the world --
and I 've got the whole whole thing , I 've got the whole thing ,
But then , I think , instead , I realized that what the fish is that what the fish is .
Because the fact of the fact is that if you managed in frantums , so that , " everything is possible , " you can 't get the freedom . You get the paralisis .
If you break the bock in a way that all deminds possible to deminate the soddisfeth .
And you get the paralisis , and you reduced the well-being .
Everybody need a sphere .
This is almost certainly too quickly , maybe even for the fish , and it 's almost certainly for us .
But the absolutely one symbolic symbolic symbolic and , theme , for the druine .
Thank you very heart .
