Last year I shown these slipositive slides to demonstrate that the arctic calottical , for almost three million years , the size of the 48 continental dimensions of the United States , it 's reaches , 40 percent .
But it 's actually the gravity of the problem because it 's not shower the shore of the ice .
The arctic glacial caloth is , in a certain sense , the clear heart of the global climate system .
You expanded up and the winter and the summer .
The next slide is going to be a rapid carrelate to the advancement of the last 25 years .
The pernasive ice ice stuck on red .
As you see , they expand down to the blue wall .
That 's the ice in the winter , which is ritira .
You can see that cosidice , as five years or more , is like blood , which is like blood , which is like blood , which is like blood , which is like blood ,
And in 25 years , it 's past , at 25 years , so .
This is a problem because the heating interest the glacier around the ocean where there are huge amounts of coal where there are huge carbon congelated that , the melated , and transformed into the microbes .
I 've been to totality of pollution to global warming , that amount could doubled , super-scale , that amount could be doubled , super-scale .
In some little laghi , in Alaska the metthane is already rebolling from water .
The professor Katey Walter in the University of Alaska was a bottom of the last last last team .
Video : Wow ! Al Gore : She 's good . The question is if we 're going to be .
And so that 's that this termical exchange change Groenland from the north .
This is a river regime to the glacial regime .
The landed never reaches to the millist .
This is the Kangerlussaughter , in the west of the Groenland .
If you want to know how the sea level for the sea level of the ice on the land , but here is where it reaches the sea .
These currents are increasing rapidly .
Another on the planet : Antarctica , the largest block of the planet .
The last month , the scientists have dichiared that the bilange of the ice is in the negative , and the Western Antarctica , which is particularly quickly , it 's particularly quickly in the month .
It 's 22-feet feet of the boundary , like Groenland .
Sulil Himalaya , the third largest block of ice , you see new laghi , which few years ago were glaciers .
40 percent of the world population is getting half of the world population 's going to leavailable .
Sulle Ande : this glacier is the source of the potability of this city .
The landed is increased .
But when it 's going to decrease , the same happens to the water .
In California , the nenow on Sierra Nevada is decreased 40 percent diminished .
Onidricual kins are in crisis .
From , as you 've read , they 're pretty good .
The growing ssafs in the world leads to an inceness of the inceness .
The environmental disaster environmental disaster , and without precedented .
Four times as many as many as many as the previous 75 years of the previous 75 .
This is a whole sustainable way .
If you look at it in the context of the context .
In the last five years we 've added 70 million tons of CO2 , 25 million tons of tons in the oceans every day .
Look at the Eastern Pacific area , the Americas , to the west , and in both parts of the Indian subcontinent , where there 's a radical radical impoverty in the oceans .
The major causes global warming , together to deforestation , which is 20 percent of them , is the fossil fuel use .
Of the oil is a problem , and the carbon is even worse .
The United States is one of the two of the most emissions , together to China .
And it was proposed to build a lot of other central coal .
But we 're seeing a direction of a direction .
These are ants projects in the last few years and some alternative proposals .
Anyway , there 's a political loght in our country .
The carbon industry and oil have spent 250 million dollars in the last year to promoting carbon , which is a oxyggggggold .
I 'm going to remember something --
Verso Natale , Tennessee , where I live , there was a loss of 3.8 billion gallons of carbon .
You 've seen it on news .
This is the second largest flow of last flow in America .
It 's happened around Natale .
The Child Reef industry was this .
Video : I 'm going to do it , " Frosty the carbon is a sign and happy .
It 's abundant here in America , and it growing our economy .
Frosty coothy the carbon .
It 's a good price , and the workers keep the wild .
Al Gore : From here is a lot of the West Virginia .
The greatest minerair on the mountain is Massey Coal . This is his administrator .
Video : Don Blankenship : I 'll be clear -- Al Gore , Nancy Pelious , Harry Reid -- they 're not talking about .
Al Gore : So the Alleance for the Clima Clima has launched two campaign .
This is a one of them , a part .
Video : Acore : Alla COALergy , we see climate change as a sery of the business .
So , our priorities is to invest a big amount of money in a effort to make public and confused to make public and confused on carbon .
In fact , carbon isn 't sports .
We think it 's cleaning -- it 's also a good prosmoke .
So not predict of climate change .
Let 's go to us .
Video : Acore : Carbone -- you 've heard a lot of a lot of talk about it .
So let 's make a turn into a road structure at the avaneeat for how it 's cleaning coal .
Straordinary ! The cars are a little noisy , but this is the sound of the cleaning technology technology .
The carbon consumption is between the main causes of global warming , but the remarkable of coal warming technology that you see changes everything .
You look at this : this is the hodiergun .
Al Gore : Indeed , the positive alternational security and the national security .
Video : The America is in crisis ; the economy , the national security crisis .
The physics that connects all : our dependence from fossil fuel , like the fossil and oil .
Now , there 's a new , audace solution to go out .
Repower : 100 percent clean energy in 10 percent .
A plan to put America to work , make us more certainly , and help us stop global warming .
Finally , a solution that is that we solve our problems .
Repower . Scoprite more .
Al Gore : This is the last .
Video : Comment : It 's a re-energy .
One of the fastest ways to bring the dependence of dependence of the combustible that killing our planet .
So , the future is here . Vent , sun , a new energy network .
So , I think of number two : New number two : New echeck for jobs .
Rpower : Repower . It 's time to be realists .
Al Gore : A old proverbio African says , " If you want to go fast , you go to fast .
If you want to go away , you go together . "
We have to go away , quickly .
Thank you very much .
LHC : Last year at TED , I introduction to LHC .
And promise to get back to how the machine works .
So here I 'm here . And for the ones that other time there were not , the LHC is the largest scientific experiment ever there -- 27 miles of the circumstances .
His task is to reconstructions that were at less than a billion of a billion , from the beginning of the universe -- to 600 million times per second .
And all of that is just environmental .
This is the machine under Ginevra .
We 're going to take these min-Big Bang in the detectors .
This is what I work . It 's called ATLAS -- is 44 feet and it 's got a 22 feet diameter .
This is an ATLALAS spectacular picture in building so you can see proportion .
Take 10 september last year , we 've accesum the machine for the first time .
And this picture was taken by ALAS .
It was because of immense festeggams in control room .
It 's an image of the first fascil of particles who had done all the LHC , entering into collision , and spread particles , with a part of the LHC , and spread particles into the detector .
In other words , when we see that picture 10 settember , we realized that machine was a great writing .
I don 't know if it was this to exultate us more or this , when somebody went on on Google and saw the page was this .
What it means we have had a cultural impact beyond to the scientific impact .
About a week later , there was a problem with the machine , and it was just to these sleep .
These file flecate 13,000 amping when the machine works at the massive .
Now , technicians of you will look at the sleep and say , " It 's not true . I 'm very subtle . "
And they can do it because when they 're very cosi-called super-----flights .
So , at least 271 degrees , at least 271 degrees on the space between stars , these sleep , can bring that current .
In one of the juncles of the most notice in the LHC , there was a fect of fit .
So the file , they surrouncing , and the 13,000 amping improvised an electrical resistance .
This was the result .
Now , this is even more impressive if you think these weighs more than 20 tons , and that they 've been moving around about 30 inches .
They were damage about 50 magneti magneti .
We had to take them , what we did .
We 've been stinated and upon them .
They 're now coming back all to their place underground .
By the end of the LHC is going to be again .
We 're going to access it , and we expect to get to the right data or June , and we 're going to go so our adventure to find out what are the mors that the universe .
Now , of course , in a way , these crashes are debate the debate on the value of science and engineering in the front . It 's easy to contempt .
I think the fact that it 's so hard , the fact that it 's the value of things like LHC .
I want to end with the words of a English scientist , Humphrey Davy , which , I suppose , in defense of the inuseful experiments of his pupile , his pupile was Michael Faraday , said , " Nient is so much dangerous for the progress of the human mind how the rent that the ideas of science are defined , that there are no , that our triumph-to be complete . "
Thank you .
I want to start asking you to rethink when , as a children , you play cover in the morning .
And as you can get them and make them , and get them and move them , and you 're going to be able to think and solve problems with space relationships .
The space reasoning is deeply connected to the way we understand a lot of the world around us .
So , as the information uselity of our interaction with physicical objects , together to my consult with my consult , and my collaborator Jeevan Kalanithi , I started asking , " And if , when we use a computer , instead of having the only of the multimate Cktop , we could make it a certain cure , we could make it surely a dden , we could make it make sure to be a sustake , with both their hands ,
and stick it to our please ?
The question was so interesting that we decided to explore the answer , building Siftable .
In a few words , a Siftable is a big interactive computer .
In a few words , a Siftable is a big interactive computer .
You can move them with your hand , they can , " see " between them , " and hear the movement and they have a screen and a radio wireless .
But basically , I 'm physicists , they 're physicists , like the mors , you can move it to simply grands .
Siftable is the example of a new ecosystem tools to manipulate digital information .
And as they become more physicists , achievement of the movement , of the other , and as they become more physicists , conscious , of the movement , of how we die them , we can explore new and have interaction .
I 'm going to start with some simple example .
This Siftable is configured to show video : if you 're going to stop it into a direction , video rotates like this , if you 're going back to .
These interactive portraits of the other interactive portraits .
If I 'm in the way , they 're interested in what they 're around .
If they 're surroundated , and they can act a little bit .
If they 're surroundated , and they can act a little bit .
They also come to their timate inclination .
We then realized that one of the interesting implications of the interaction was to be able to use common data , for example , " to mention " a color as if it was a liquid .
In this case , we have three Siftable of configurate as a sleck and I can use them to the color in that central , where they mix .
and I can use them to fix color in the middle , where they 're missed .
We 're going to be too much place , we can put a bit a place .
There are also beautiful possibilities of learning , like language , and the mathematics and logic games where people can try to try things quickly , and see the results of it immediately .
I 'm --
This is a Fibonaccount I do with a program of equations .
Here we have a game of words that 's half between Scarabeer and Boble .
Pratically , at every Siftable , and you get a letter to every Siftable , Pratically , at every Siftable , and you 're looking for for a letter , and you know , you 're trying to make it on a dictionary .
Then , after about 30 seconds they 're remissed , and you have a new letters to try and new possibility to try .
Thank you .
Here 's here here here in the Media Lab , I did this so I tried them and I turned a video .
They are pleasure very much .
And one of the interesting things like this kind of application is that you don 't have to give people a lot of education .
You just say , " Compons of words , " and they know exactly what to do .
Here 's here to other people try it .
This is our youngsters headest there on the right .
It actually wanted to be impilling .
They just were in morning , for him .
Now , this is an application of an interactive cartoon .
We wanted to build a tool for the learning of language .
It can put new characters in the scene , lifting the Siftable to associate with them .
It can put new characters in the scene , lifting the Siftable to associate with them .
So , it 's doing the sun .
Video : The sun is smiling .
David Merrill : Now she took a treat the back .
Video : The handange .
Bel work ! Yeah !
So , the Siftable and put on the neighbors can interact with the characters --
Video : Bau !
... inventing their own story .
Video : Hi !
DM : It 's a story with open , and it can decide him as you want .
DM : It 's a story with open , and it can decide him as you want .
Vola : Fill-forth ,
DM : The last example I have time to show you is a tool , made of recent , to sample and exececececececececectual , to sample music .
It 's a tool , made of recent , to trampionee and execececectful .
Siftable here on sounds like the bass and the bacteria .
Each one of these has four different variations , and you can choose what to use .
And you can also put these sounds in a sequence to compete with pleasure .
And it just by making it just touch a swesequence . "
These are actually actually able effectively you can control from the live and the filter .
You 're going to attacks to a particular sound and then inclens for them .
And then there are the general effectively as time and volume , which is applied in sequence .
Let 's look at how it works .
Video : We 're going to start putting a two-Siftable in a series , we 're going to put it into a series , we put it in a series , we add the other basic basic .
Now I put a basement line .
Video : I add the percussions --
Video : And I 'll put the filter at the bacteria , so I can check the alive effect of the live effect .
Video : I can be able to be brought out the entire sequence , by the time by one side .
Video : I 'll add the bottom and I 'll add the lower string for expression .
Video : I can recombine the sequence of the flight .
So I don 't have to plan it before , but I can improvise , make it longer or the short .
And now , finally , I can spend the whole sequence by the left , the Siftable to the Siftable .
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is to build new mo-machine interfaces to work our brain and body .
And today , I had time to show you one of the results of this path , and also some chance we try to bring out of the lab .
The concept I want to transmit is that it 's coming to this new generation of designed to interact with digital media , which will bring information in our world in the way we want .
Thank you very much .
I can see the now I 'm talking to all of you .
I 'm a writer .
I 'm going to clap is my profession , but it 's more than that , of course .
It 's also love and the fascination of my life .
And I don 't expect that it can change .
But , I said , something particularly happened in my life and my career , which brought me to recently my interibring with this work .
The particular thing is I recently written this book , this biography called " Mangia , " The Ama , diversally from my previous books , for some reason why came out in the world and became a big , bestseller , interational feelty ,
And the result is that everywhere is it 's going to be now , people treat me as if I were convicted .
It 's true -- you 're convicted .
They 're going to be worried of me and they say , " Don 't you 're afraid to do better ?
Don 't you fear to continue to write the whole life without being able to create a book that can important book to be able to make somebody ? "
that can be importantly to somebody ? "
It 's certainly , you know .
But it could go worse , part of the time I remember that I 'm over 20 years ago , when I started saying to people -- I was an adolescent -- I wanted to be a writer .
I was going to encounter at the same reaction based on the fear .
And people said , " Don 't I 'm going to successful ? "
Do you know , you know , the umillion killed you ?
Do you don 't care to make this walk for all life without anything out of life , and they die on a heart of dreams with the mouth of the slower with the mouth of the focus on the mouth cenergies ? "
So , you know .
The answer to all these questions is , " Yes . "
Yes , I 'm afraid of all those things .
I 've always had fear .
And I also 'm afraid of many other things that people could not indeed .
As the algae and other things .
But , as it was about the writing what I thought and I was just , because ?
Is it rational ?
It 's logical that anyone who has to wait to be frightened by a work that feeling to do .
But what is there 's so particular in the creative and make it nervous health about the mental health of the mental health .
How my father , for example , he was a chemistry engineer and I don 't remember once in his 40 years of activity in her 40 years of activity to be engineer ?
There was never -- that blok of engineer John , what does ?
It didn 't work like this , you know ?
Onest , chemicals like group have not certainly , in the centuries , warning the reputation of being alcolized , depressive to be alcocolized .
We have enough writers , we have enough this reputation , and not just writers , but creative creative of all kinds of instainable to mentally unstable .
And it 's not something that you look at the sad of contexts or creative deaths that , only in the 20th century , they died young people and often died young people and often died young people .
And even the ones that you don 't have been suiciassuiciassuicious from their dunes .
Norman Mailer , before I die , in the last interview said , " Every , " My wild , " Every , " an extraordinary affermation about the work of their life .
But we don 't get it up , because we 've heard these things so long that somehow we 've completely interiorized and acceptacy the notion that creativity and suffering are somehow titilated and suffering are somehow titilinked and the art , at the end , it will always have to be a bone-.
And the question I want to ask all to all here today is : are you agree with this idea ?
It 's good for you -- because it 's also looking at it from a centimeter of the distance to me , it 's all good for this supposition .
I think it 's hate .
And I think it 's also dangerous and I don 't want to see the perpetuate perpetuate in the next century .
I think it 's better encouraging our big minds to live .
And I certainly know , in my case -- in my situation -- it would be very dangerous to start smoke up to that dark the supposition , especially given the circumstances in my career .
It 's pretty -- I mean , you look pretty young , I 'm pretty young , I 've been about 40 years .
I still have about four worth work in me .
And it 's very likely that anything I 'm going to be right now going to be judged by the world like the work that I 've been doing this as a very success of my last book .
I 'm going to be slavery , because we 're all more or less frightening here -- is I likely to my back .
Oh , Gesu , who thought !
You know this is the kind of thinking that leads a person starting to start drink in the nine of the morning and I don 't want to do it .
I would keep going to continue to do this work that I love .
So , the question becomes , what it does ?
And so , I think , after many reflections , which the way to work to continue to get to be to create a psychological construction , OK ?
I had to find a safety distance of security between me , I 'm writing , and my natural anxial , which is that it will get to get up and , and I was trying to figure out how to start looking through the time , trying to find other society , trying to see if they could have better ideas and sane and more healthy ideas to see if they could have to have better ideas and more healthy ideas to see if they could have have better ideas and more healthy ideas ,
about how to help people with creative people manage inerent emotivity .
And that research took me to the ancient Greek and ancient Rome .
I 'm going to go through my circle and then it 's coming back .
In the ancient Grek and ancient Rome -- people didn 't seem to believe that creativity come from men , OK ?
And it was thinking that creativity was this spirit healing and they come to men from a few distant and unknown , for reasons distant and unknown , for reasons distant and unknown , for reasons .
The Greeeeye-to-wns , the healthy dians of creativity .
Socrate , wonderful , wonderful , he believed to have a losissues that wisdom wisdom .
The Rooms were in the same idea , but they called the " kind of spirit .
which is great , because the Rooms didn 't really think that a genius was particularly smart .
They thought that a genius was this kind of divine entity , which was literally in the walls of a study , a little bit like the elphus of the Asssent of hidden , and it turns out the work of the artist and share the work of the work of the artist and models the output of that work .
Except -- here 's the distance of which I talk about -- that psychological construction that you protected psychological construction you protected from your work .
And everybody knew that was how it worked , right ?
So the antiks were protected by certain things , like , for example , too much too much narcism , right ?
If your work was exceptional , you couldn 't take all the smart , all of you know that you were helped by this genius .
If your work failure , it wasn 't your whole , you know , you know ?
Everybody knew that it was your genius to be an inable .
And so people han conceived creativity in the West for a long time .
Then the Renaissent came and everything , and it 's all this big idea ; we put the human being center of the universe above all the mysteries and without leave space to the windites .
This was the rational principle of humanth and people began to think creativity was completely from the hydivided .
And for the first time in history , he started to refer to this or artist as a genius , like a rather than a person with genius .
And I have to tell you , I think it was a big mistake .
I think I allow somebody , a simple person to believe that it 's a very much like the source , the essence and the source of all the mysteries , creativity and inknowable and ethernal and ethernal liability is a file too big to give to the fragile psychologists .
It 's like to ask someone to enjoy the sun .
Demutual and distores all these inexible expectations on performance .
And I think it was this pressure that I was destroyed to the 500 years .
And , if this is true , and I think it 's , the question becomes , and now ?
Can we do that diversity ?
Maybe you can go back to a more old understanding of the relationship of humans and creative mystery .
Or maybe not .
Maybe we can 't sing 500 years of rational thinking in a talk about 18 minutes .
And there 's probably people in the audience who would solleverage scientific lectiles on the notion of , you know , they follow the people to spend their projects .
I 'm probably not going to convince you all about this thing .
But the question I would like to ask is -- why not ?
Why don 't it 's going to think about this way ?
Because it has more sense of everything that I 've ever heard to explain the exabove imprevebility of the process .
One process that , as anyone who ever tried to do something -- so , all of this -- so , all here -- you know , you 're not compored .
And in fact , it can sometimes seem completely paranormal .
I did this meeting with the extraordinary poetry Ruth Stone , who 's now 90s , but that 's a poetry for all life and said that during her childhood in the rural Virginia , worked out in the camps , and I felt it , it was working out in if , when a poetry came from .
He said it was like a fragorous train .
And that was rotoling to her landscape .
He was going to hear it , because he was to throw the earth under his feet .
He knew I had one thing to do at that point and it was of , words , " run like a match . "
And so it 's going to go home and she was sitting in this poem , and it wouldn 't have to take a piece of paper and a pencil of it , and a pencil of it , and she would be tracked and grade it on the page .
Other three times I couldn 't be enough , so it 's rich , and it 's runs and correct without getting to the home and the rotoling her through and she loved it and she would continue to rot through the landscape , and she would continue through the other poet . "
Then there were those times -- this piece I 'm never forget -- there were moments where the was almost losing , OK ?
So , she was running home and she was trying to take paper and the poem and the poem was going through , and then he was going , and then he said , that it was like , and then he was like , and then it was like , and she cool .
He was a poem from the coda and remain her body and they would spend it into the page .
And in these cases , the poem would be presented on the perfect and the contrary , but the contrary , as the last word at the first .
So when I heard it , I heard it -- it 's very crazy , it 's exactly the same thing .
Not all my creative process -- I 'm not a convict !
I 'm a mulo , and my way to work is ; I 'm wake up with the same orary every day and work and work on it , and it 's going to be above .
But even I , in my testing , I 've been shown up against that thing , sometimes .
And I suppose a lot of you the han .
You know , even if the work and ideas were to come from a certain source , you can 't know .
And what is this thing ?
And how we relate to it in a way that we don 't lose your head , but , rather , what does it remain sane ?
As I 'm going to , the best contemporary example I have is the musicist Tom Waits , which I interviews different years ago for a newspaper .
We were talking about this , and you know , Tom , for the majority of life was the incarnation of the incarnation of the incarnation , trying to control , domining these species of totally inherself .
But then he was aging , he cut down , and one day , and one day , he was driving on a L.A. , changed everything for him .
He was going to be fast and all of a tract of this little feels of melody , which comes into his head as the inspiration , elusive and the wild , and the wants , you know , it 's wonderful , and the desider , but it 's wonderful , and the desider , but it doesn 't know how to take it .
It 's not a piece of paper , it 's not a matt , it 's not a matt .
So it starts to hear this species of old anxiety , and I 'm going to lose , and I 'm going to lose , and I 'm going to hold it .
I 'm not good enough and I can 't do it . "
And instead of going to the panic , you stop .
He 's going to be a whole whole world . And he did something completely new .
He just just the sky and said , " Scuses , I 'm not driving ? "
" Do you think it can write a song now ?
If you really want to exist , it 's going to be a more opporting when I can take care of you .
Or , you 're going to be able to importunning someone else today .
You 're going to disturbing Leonard Cohen . "
And his work process changed after this .
Not the work , the work , it was still dark .
But the process , and the heavy anxiety that was released when the genius , the genius that he was caused the genius that he was going to be interized and remain it back from where it was , making it back from where it was , making it didn 't have to be a interized and remaining it .
but you know , this peculiar , wonderful bizarre collaboration between Tom and this strange and outside it was that it wasn 't Tom .
So , as I felt that story started to change a little bit the way I was working in and I was always save up .
This idea , I save up when I was writing " Mangia , Prega , " and falls in one of those cave disperation where we 're doing all working on something and we can 't start thinking that it 's going to be a disaster , which is going to be the worst book written .
Not just bad , just the worst book written .
And I started thinking about therefore I started thinking about thrild .
But then I was talking about Tom who was talking to the air and I tried to us .
So I stand up my face on the wanddress and rid my comments to a vacuum of the room .
And I said , " Look , what , both , you know , both , if this book is not going to be brilliant , no matter ?
Because I 'm putting everything I have , I don 't have more than that .
So if you want to be better , you have to show you and do your own part .
OK . But if you don 't do it , you know what , I don 't do it .
I 'll tell you to write the same because it 's my work .
And I would like to do for me that it was recorded to make me me in my part , " Because -- finally , OK -- centuries it does , you know , the sackle of the sackle , dances and music that they would go on and sacred in the room and hours to the stuff .
And they were always magnificent , because the dance were professionals and they were fantastic .
But every while , rarely , something happened , and one of these artists became transformative actually .
And I know what I 'm talking about , because I know you all saw it , at a certain point , a performance like this .
It was like the time you stops , and the dance walked through a kind of landscape and it wasn 't a different from the usual , and it was trained .
And sudden sudden , it doesn 't only look at the same .
But it 's going to come from the diinside and under the illumination of divinity .
And when this happened , the time , the people knew what was , they called it .
They 'd sent their hands and they were starting to sing , " Allah , Allah , Allah , God , " God , "
That 's God , you know .
Curious note -- when the South of Spain invaded , I was this abitude with them and the ready to change in the centuries from " Allah , Allah , Allah , Allah , Allah , Allah , " to " Ole , " , " which you can still hear in the corries or the flew .
In Spain , when a artist did something impossible and magic , " Allah , " Allah , Allah , I was good , " incomprererehensible , it -- a last of God .
And it 's great because we need .
But , the problem comes up the day , the dance , the dance , the dance of the dance , and it 's the 11th of Martedriesck and the last last of God , there 's no longer .
It 's just a mortal with gran bad for the knees , and maybe it 's never going to make it anymore to make it down .
And maybe nobody will sell the name of God , and what does it have to do with the rest of his life ?
It 's hard .
This is one of the most paorous recognizations to make in a creative life .
But maybe it doesn 't have to be so angoscious if you can 't believe , mostly not to believe , mostly the most extraordinary aspects of your being come from yourself .
But you 're just believed that you 're being data in prestted by an inimaginable source of this team that 's been to spend up with someone else when you finished .
And , you know , if we think it 's all changes .
And so I started thinking about it , and it 's certainly how I thought I 've thought about several months in the book working that I 'll be doing , the dangerous , attesissus , waiting followed my my great success .
And what I have to continue to me when I feel electured by this is , it 's not fear .
Not just shall your work .
It 's a present-the-presentation for your side , any can be .
If your work is dance , it 's dance .
If the divine , it 's absurd to you assigned decide to leave a few kinds of wonderful , for one moment through your efforts , then " Ole ! "
Other , you do the same your dance .
And " Ole ! " to you yourself .
I think , and I think I should teach it .
" Ole ! " to you , even for having human and testing tale of love and testing tale of making you continue to make you continue to make you continue .
Thank you .
Thank you .
June Cohen : Ole !
As I 've already talked about some of these projects on the human genome , what it can mean and the discovery of new set of genes .
Now we 're starting a new path . We started digitizing biology and now we 're starting to digital code we 're entering a new phase of biology , designing and synthesize life .
We always tried to ask for a big questions .
What is life ? " It 's something that many biologists I think have tried to understand vararies .
We tried different approaches , reduced it to the minimum minimes .
We 're digitizing for almost 20 years .
When we sequenced the human genome was treated to spend from the world of the biology of the world in the computer world .
Now we can regenerate life , can we regenerate life , or create new life from this digital universe ?
This is the map of a small organism , Mycoplasma genitalium , which is the smallest species of the smallest genome between those who can authorean .
And we tried to reduce the genome to create a little bit smaller .
We can eliminate a hundred genes of genes of about 500 that I 'm here .
But when we look at the metabolic map , it 's relatively simple than our .
He 's just a little bit of a .
But when we look at all the genes that we can eliminate , one at the time , it 's very improbable that this can bring to a living cells .
So we decided that the only way to procret was synthize this chromosome way that can be modifying the components to bring some of these fundamental questions .
And so we started the adventure of the " CCCCCan we synthesize a chromosome ? "
Can the chemistry to make these big molecules that we never have been able to create before ?
And in case , we can make a chromosome ?
A crumosoma is just a piece of chemical material material .
The speed with which we 're able to digitize life is growing up in exponential .
Our genetic code , but it 's a very slowly , proproproproproprogret rather slowly , but it 's getting improving .
And our most recent results , the results of exponential .
We 've been over 15 years ago .
The process has been asked a lot of passages , starting with a bioethical requires before we started the early experiments .
But we found that synthesize DNA is very difficult .
There are tens of thousands of thousands of machines in the world that are producing small segments , and it 's a degenerative process : the most segment is the longer , the most segment is .
So we had to develop a new method to assembly these fragments and correct the mistakes .
And this was our first attempt , we 've been to go from the digital genome of the X 174 .
It 's a little virus that kills bacteria .
We designed the fragments , we actually did the grass and get a DNA molecule of the DNA molecule .
The interesting part is when we took this piece of chemical chemicals and we put it into bacteria , the bacteria , the bacteria have started reading this genetic code and viral particles .
The viral particles have been released by cells , they came back and they destroyed the E.
I 've talked about recent with the oil industry said , " The CEO industry said that they certainly compressed this model .
They 've been more than you .
We believe this is a situation where software can actually build his same hardware in a biological system .
But we wanted to make things biggest in big .
We wanted to build the entire crumosome bacteria .
I 'm over 580 thousand letters of genetic code .
So we thought we build it in the cassets of the size of the virus , so that we can change the cassses to figure out what are the components of a living cells .
The design is critical , and if we start with digital information in a computer , these have to be very accurate .
When we sequenced this genome for the first time in 1995 accuracy standard was a mile for every 10 thousand lower .
We found it , resequencing it , 30 errors . If we had that original sequence we never would be able to do it work .
One part of the process is designing 50 letters to build underlying 50 letters to build underneath the other 50 letters to build underneath pounits to build underneath .
We try to the unique elements here .
You probably read that we read that we put in the filigate .
Think about this : we have a genetic code based on four letters : Actually , C , G and T.
Three of those letters put together with about 20 lominoacids , and there 's a specific order to reading for every lominds .
So we can use genetic code to write words , stasy , thinking .
What we did at the beginning was autographed .
Some of them have been dollar by the fact that it wasn 't poem .
We designed these segments to just join them with enzymes .
There are some enzymes that they repair them and put them on .
And we started assembly with the parts , starting with segments from five to seven thousands and reading , unending up in a way to form the segment of 24 thousands of leckers to them to get 72 thousand and then they can get 72 mile .
And in the every step we made these segments in abundance so that we 're trying to make an extremely road , which we 're trying to create an extremely robust -- as you 'll see in a minute .
We 're trying to automatize the process .
So , this seems like the tabellon a low basket player .
When we get these very long , over 100 thousand low low low low low , it will not grow in the E.
You get to the modern modern of molecular biology .
So we 've looked at other mechanisms .
We knew about another mechanism called recombination omologists , which in biology is uliwarning to repair the DNA to join the segment .
Here 's an example .
This organism , called Deinococcus radiodurans , can absorb three million radiation .
You can see in the upper square like his chromosome like the chromosome .
In 12 -- 24 hours it 's been replaced exactly as it was before .
They are thousands of organisms that they can do it .
These organisms can sit completely .
They can live under empty .
I 'm absolutely sure life exist in space , and you hear to find new environments of the water .
ASA shot , NASA shown this is that this is .
This is an image of the molecule that we built using these processes , just using the yeast with the design of the appropriate design of the appropriate design of the insert of the molecule that we built by using these processes , and just using these processes , and just using these processes , and just using these processes , and just using these proc
The yeast assemble is automatically .
This picture wasn 't taken with an electronic microscope , but with a microscope .
It 's a molecule so big that we can see it with a microscope .
These are pictures that cover a period of about six seconds .
This is the ad that we 've done a little time ago .
I 'm over 580,000 letters of genetic code .
It 's the largest molecule of a defined structure that man .
It has a 300 million inexecular molecular weight .
If you 're going to stay with a 10-spaces without spaces , it would like 142 pages to transcscreen this genetic code .
Now , how do we do it work ? How can we do it ?
Of course , of course , you 're through a virus is a game .
It 's a little bit more complicated when they use bacteria .
It 's simpler cell when it 's the eucariote like our . You can just extract nucleus and put another , which is basically the process of cloning .
In the archaea bacterm is instead , it 's instead of integrated in the cell , but we 're able to make a complete transplant of a chromosome from one cell to another and activity .
We clear a cmosome chromosome from a microbial .
The two are the different as the men from mouse .
We 've added a few gene gene in a way that you can decide what to choice for this chromosome .
And then I 'm skip with the enzymes in a way to kill all the proteins .
And when we put it in the cell was amazing -- and you 'll appreciate our sophisticatooowned -- the new chromosome -- the new chromosome -- it 's gone inside the cells .
And we were thinking that we couldn 't go beyond , but we tried the way to spush us in there .
This is one of the greatest mechanisms of evolution .
We found that a lot of species have added a second third crumosoma somewhere , put it in a second thousand tracks to a second thousand tracks to the species .
So who think about evolution as only gene at the time you 're going to modified a lot of time in biology .
They 're in the enzyme called restriction enzyme that even digest the DNA .
The chromosome that was in the cell not one .
The mobile phones that we have inserit-down , which we have inserit--down .
He expressed , and it recognized the other as expressed material chromosoma , and we found it with only the cell and the new chromosoma .
It became blue because of the genes we put on .
And in a short sorts of time , all the characteristics of a species , went perse , and it turned around into a new species , based on the new software that we put in the cells .
All the proteins have changed , the membranes have changed , and when we read the genetic code , exactly exactly exactly what we 've transferred to you .
Now , this could look at genetic altering , but altering the DNA software , we can change things in a substantial way .
Now , I 've already explained that this is not talking about genesis -- but it 's starting with three million years of evolution , and I already said that maybe we 're going to create new species of Cambriana , where they 're going to create new species on this digital .
Why do that ?
I think it 's pretty obvious when we think about our needs .
We 're going to move from six and a half billion people in the next 40 years .
Just to give an example : I was born in 1946 .
Now there are three people on the planet for each existing in 1946 years , there 's going to be four .
We 're having problems now to find out food , fresh water and a half billion people .
It will be even more harder to do it for nine billion .
We use more than five billion of the oil , more than 30 billion baries .
That means a hundred million barrels a day .
When we try to find biological processes , or any kind of process to replace them , it 's going to be a huge challenge .
We have to keep the whole whole hemisphere of CO2 from these materials that 's going into the atmosphere .
At the day , because of the scientific discoveries in all the world , we have a database with about 20 million genes , and I like to think they are the designed components for the future .
The electronic industry possible only one dozen of components , and think about how many different things came out .
Our limits are principles of the biological and our imagination .
Now we have techniques , because of these quick methization , in fact , create what we call the combinatory .
We can build a big robot that can produce a million chromosomes a day .
Think of processing these 20 million genes are different genes or to try to optimize the processes to produce eighttan or drugs , new vaccines , and we can change , through a small team , and create more biology now that in the last 20 years of science .
And it 's just a standard selection .
We can choose to survival , chemical production , chemical production , or fuel ,
This is an instantaneous of some software programmed that we 're working to be able to sit and design species to computers .
Well , we don 't necessarily know how it will be .
We know exactly how they 're genetic code .
Now we 're focused on the fourth generation of the fourth generation .
You 've seen even seen you that extract hetanol was a bad experiment .
We have carburants of second and third generation that will be used to be sugar with the higher carburvers .
But the only way the only way biology can have a big impact without increasing the cost of the food and limitargue , it would transform CO2 in matter before , so we 're working on design cells that we can have the first fuel that we can have the first fuel that we can have the first fuels of the quarters in about 18 months .
The solar light with CO2 is a metodo-do-- but in our discoveries all over the world , we 've found different methods .
This is a organism that we 've described in 1996 .
It lives in deep ocean , about 2,500 feet of the water in the deep ocean temperature .
They create meter from CO2 , using hydrogen molecular as energy source .
We 're trying to figure out if we can incanalate CO2 , which can easily be transported through , converting that CO2 in carburting , to drive this process .
So , so we can think that we could be able to increase the whole question of " which is , " We , " that 's the life " is , we , we have the modress goal to replace the whole oil industry .
Exactly . If you can 't do it from TED , where can ?
It would be a main source of energy .
And also , we 're working for using the same metods to create instantaneous vaccines .
You 've seen this year with flu , we 're always back and a year and with a dollar in less when it 's coming to find the right .
I think what you can change by building vaccines in adicking .
So this is how the future could start looking at the evolution , now , the tree of evolution , accelerating evolution with synthetic bacterial cells , and then inally , areeucariote cells .
We 're so far from improving people .
Our purpose is to make it very long enough to try to live long enough to try to do it . Thank you very much .
First of all I 'll show you , the fastest possible , some fundamental work , the new technology that we took to Microsoft in follow a year ago . This is Seadragon .
It 's a environment where you can interact with a local level that remote with a huge amount of visual data .
Here we 're seeing a lot of gigabyte digital photographs with a kind of expensive , and continuous , for a panoramic quake , and I put the pictures like we want .
And it doesn 't matter how big the amount of information that we see , how big these data is , or the images .
Most of them are digital photographs , but this for example is a scanning from the Library of the Congress , and it comes back in the gam 300 megapile .
It doesn 't make any difference because the only thing that you have the prestations of a system like this is the number of pixel on your screen in any time . It 's also a very flexible architecture .
This is a whole book , example of data not images .
This is the Casa desolate Casa desolate . Every colonna represents a chapter .
So to show you that it 's just just a lot of texture and not images , we can do something like that , to actually see that it 's a real real representation of the text , not a picture .
It could be a way a little artificial way to read electronic book .
Not you consiice .
This is a more realistic example . It 's a number of the Guardian .
Every big image is the beginning of a section .
And it 's really giving you the pleasure and the beautiful experience to read the real load version of a magazine , or a newspaper , which is for a moltex .
We also made something with the angle of the angle of the Lardian .
We 've created a higher solution-solution-solutionary advance -- and we 've put it in a normal advertising -- and we put extra in the content .
If you want to see the characteristics of this automobile , you can see it here .
Or other models , or even the techniques specific .
And this really shows some of these ideas to eliminate the limits of space on the screen .
We hope that that means to fire up to a pop-up , and other similar similar , it doesn 't have to be necessary .
Of course , the map is one of the most obvious applications for this kind of technology .
And I don 't want to lose time , if we don 't say we have contribute to give them to give up in this field .
These are all the streets in the United States , above a geospace ,
So now we go to something else .
This is now actually from the Web ; you can go to the Web ; you can go to see it .
This is a project called Photosynthy , which combines two different technologies .
One is Seadragon and the other is a visual computer research in the Noah Snavely , a student University of Washington , with Steve Snavely , with Steve Seitz of Microsoft Rick Szeliski Rick . Agi with the Rick Szi Rick . Agi Prarab . "
And it 's the living on the Web , I managon the Weadron .
You can see it when we do this kind of screen , where we can spend from one image to the other and have this kind of experience to the other kind of experience .
But the space collocation of images here has actually meaning .
The computer algorithms of computers have been recorded these images together , so that they have all been tired to the real places where they 've got them -- all ssskept into the canadesi-- you 're shown up . So here you see of the elements of a slide shot up , and these things are all lines in the space , and these things are all lines .
I don 't know if I have time to show you some other environment .
There are a lot more space .
I want to move directly to one of the Noah-original data of Noah-- and this comes from a previous prototype of Photosynthy that we 've done for the first summer last summer -- to show you what I think is really the key to be the key to this technology , the Photosynthy , and it 's not necessarily evident at the environments we put in the web .
We had to worry about legal aspects and so on .
This is a rebuild of Notre Dame images in Notre Dame images from Flickr . Basta digiterad Notre Dame and you get pictures of the sloping campus , and you get pictures of the orange of the areas is discovered to this .
So they 're all images that Flickr and they 've all been connected to this way .
And it 's possible to be able to be very simple way .
You know , I never thought I would end up for Microsoft .
It 's very gratificent receiving these kinds of academics here .
I think you can see that it 's a lot of different kinds of photoss : from those mobile phones to those SLR , a number significant number , put together in this environment .
And if I can , I try to try to look at those strange .
Many of them are faces by faces , etc .
On some part here is a series of photographs -- here .
This is a poster of Notre Dame record Dame recorded .
We can go from the poster to the physics of this environment .
The essential point is that we can do things with social environment . This is now taking data from supply protective data from the whole memory of how it looks like the land , from the sidictone-sight , and connects to all those data together .
All those pictures become connected together , greater than the sum .
You have a model of the land which emerges .
Think about this as a prolungation of Stephen Lawler on Earth .
It 's something that grows in complexity as well as people use it , and the advantages for people who are going to use it .
Their pictures are husbed with inseries of other people .
If to somebody comes the idea of contract all these sannotion , my picture of Notre Damn sudden Dame Dame suddenly requires of all those data , and I can use it as a kind of in-imgerms in that metapuniverse , using the picture of anyone else , and have a red experience , and you have a cross-to-out experience of a red , and the cross-user experience .
Of course , a consequence of all of this are virtual virtual models of every interesting part of the land , collective and similar pictures and similar images and similar images and similar images and similar and similar satin .
Thank you .
Chris Anderson : I 've got got to do well ? What your software is that you 're going to take us to do is that at a certain point , in the next few years , all the photographs are going to be practically connected together ?
BAA : Yeah . What 's doing is basically , it 's discovered .
It 's creating hyperlink , if you want , between images .
And it 's doing it in the content of the images .
The thing becomes very interesting if you think about wealth of semantic information that many of these pictures have .
As you make a picture of the web , you have a phrase and the text on the web page has a lot of information about pictures .
Now , what happens if that picture you connect all your pictures ?
So the amount of semantic interconnection and the amount of wealth that comes up is really huge . It 's a classic effect of the network .
CA : Blaise , it 's really incredible . Compliments .
BAA : Thank you very much .
One of the main pleasure pleasure when you travels and one of the thetnographics of the etnographics , the people who have no forgotten the traditions , the past in the wind , you have the past in the wind , you 're going to stick it in the levigate leleaves .
I think the sciamani Jaguar travel to beyond the Lattea , or that the myths of the elders of the elders of the people are still significant , or that in Himalaya , the buddists still infollow breath of the Dharmful anthropology , and the idea that the world in which we live in there 's no way , but it 's just a model of reality , but it 's just a model of reality ,
the consequence of a particular adaptive set of adaptative choices that our stones did , well .
And , of course , we all share of the essential tracts .
We all procreating .
We 're subjects back to the initiation .
We have to death inexorability of death , so we 're not surprising us if we 're sent and we 're going to --
We all have an art .
What it 's the pells of the song , the rhythm of the dance of the dance of every culture .
It doesn 't matter that they 're the Penan forests of the Borneo , or the follow of the Vodoo 's the follow of the Kenya , or the desert Curander in Kenya settentrional skeppppells .
He was my own journey in desert a month ago , or a yak cool in the Keep 's values , the deae of the world 's world .
All of these populations teaching us that there are other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , other ways of moving around the world .
And if you think it 's a concept , it 's a concept that it can give you hope .
And together , together , the world 's myries create a spiritual lifetime and cultural life that happens the planet and it 's important for the well-being of the planet and it 's important for well-being of the planet as a biological ragnota as biosphere .
And you can think about this cultural ragnatela as an etnosphere and you can define the total sum of all the concepts , dreams , mites , myths , ideas , inspirations , inspiration , from human imagination from the beings of consciousness .
The etnosphere is the fantastic patrial patriage of humanity .
It 's the symbbobol of what we are and what we can be in as inquisitive species .
And because biosphere was quite as well as the biosphere has been as much as it happened to the etnosphere and unfortunately more quicker .
Nobody biological , for example , it would say that 50 percent of all species was or is on the orders of extinction simply because it 's fake , or -- in the most apocalyptic diversity , and not even close to the most optimistic issues -- that 's the most optimistic -- that of cultural diversity .
The index of all that is , of course , language loss .
When you were born 6,000 languages on this planet .
A language is not just a vocabulary , just from a vocabulary or a series of rules .
A language is the sprasic of the human spirit .
It 's the half of the animal culture comes into the material world .
Every language is a forest , a bacin mind , a bacin mind , a remarkable , thinking , a remarkable system .
And of those 6,000 languages , as we 're here sitting in Monterey , at least half the half of the people are not sustake in the ears of the children .
They 're no longer teaching children , which means , unless you shouldn 't share something , which is already death .
What is there more sad than being being being being being being done by the silence , of being the last to talk a language , the people talking to a language , the wisdom of the sandwich , or to anticipate the promise of the sagness of the smoke ?
This is a faced of someone in the world every two weeks , every two weeks , and a send , and it 's door to the tomble syllabe and door in the tomble .
And I know somebody who will say , " Don 't it ?
The world would not be a better place if you 're talking to all the same language ? "
We talk about kogue .
You 're going to be at a tract thing that 's not to talk about your language .
And I would like to do you , I would like to do a journey through the thnosphere --
a little travel in the etnosphere to give you a hip of what we 're losing .
Many of us forget that when I say different ways of existing , " I mean different ways of existing .
We take for example this Barasana Barasana , in Amazonia , the popular of anaconda , which crede the myththic of prosessing in the waste of the waste of the east in the snake .
It 's a popular people who don 't get the blue color from the green , because the time you were identified in the forest , which depends on the forest , which depends the popular .
They have a strange language and a marriage rule , called the language .
And all of that radical , in the past mystical , though the particularity is that in these expensive families where they talk to six or seven languages because of the mystery one of the mystery one that 's a language .
They 're just going to listen and then they start talking .
We take one of the most interesting tribes that I lived , the Waorani of Ecuador north , an incredible popular that had the first contacts in 1958 .
In 1957 , five missionaries have trigging a failure .
They did come down the photographs that rate them in the photographs that they thought that they would have come from , forests , forests that this popular forested forests had never seen anything .
They pictures of the land , they spend it up , and they spend it to the shape or a shape and , not finally , they would kill the hell , and they kill the five missionaries with the lance .
But the Waorani not only to kill the foreign .
They were killed with them .
54 percent of the mortality was caused by themselves .
We 're going to eight generations to eight generations and we found two cases of natural morath and when we 've been indeed with , they were so aged that , and then they kill it kill it .
The hunters were able to recognize the urin 40 , and recognize the species .
In the early ' 80s , I 've been assigned a very interesting task when my professor of Harvard , and he asked me if I wanted to go to Haiti to sweat , and the Tonton Macooling and Tonton Macoutes , and Tonton Macoutes , and I would have been shown up for the fast .
For give a sense of miraculous , I should understand Vodoun culture and the Vodoo 's not magic .
It 's pretty much a metapphysics of the world .
Much interesting .
If I would ask you to tell me the big religions of the world , what would you say ?
Cristianism , Islam , Buddism , Ebraism , etc .
A continent is always left out , thinking that sub-Saharan Africa doesn 't have any religious feeding . And yes and the Vodoo not the other than the distilside of these religious concepts in the tragic tragic concepts .
What makes the voodoo is the intended interest between life and death .
So the alive of the spirits .
The spirits can be invocated by the Great Acqua , they respond to the rhythm of the dance and they replace the temporarily in-soul in a way that for a short way that for a very short time ,
So , for this voodooists , " You go white to the voodooists to talk about God .
We say God , " We 're going to deventirely and forth God . "
And since the moment you 're stuck , it 's the spirit that you , as you can make it wrong ?
So you see these incredible events , follow in the trance of trance , the trance of trance that touches touches a pretty strong demonstration of the power of mind when it 's catalyzed in a state of extreme ,
In all the populations with which I lived the most extraordinary Kogi of Sierra Nevada Santa Marta , in the Santa Marta , in the Santa Marta , in the Santa Marta .
Desigges of the ancient civilization that once once they lived on the caraibic plants in the conquerte , the popular of the Colombia , the popular smomosafety , which is the popular of the charaibic civilization .
In a snared continent macked , this popular is never conquisted by the Spanish .
So , they are governmented by a clergy , but their formation is very extraordinary .
The young people follow from the families to three or four , and they live in a world that they made of darkness in a world made of darkness and shadow into the bottom of the glaciers for 18 years .
Two periods of nine years of proposes to reproduce the nine months of management that they spend in the uterts of the mother , I 'm metaphorically in the utert of the Great Mother .
For all this time , they 're acculturate to the values of their society , values that they 're preretasters and only their prayers keep the cosmic balance -- or to say the balance --
At the end of this incredible initiation , they 're suddenly taken out and for the first time in life , at the age of 18 , they see a stuff . And in that moment in that consciousness of the first ball of the time , when the sun sun is , all that they 've learned in theory . The predict does it a step back and says , all of the time , which has learned in the theory . The predict does a step back and says ,
" Vissue ? I 'm going to tell you .
It 's amazing . Now it 's now to you protect it . "
They call them greater brothers and they say that we , the minor minor brothers , we 're the destruction of the world .
This level of intuition is extremely important .
When we think about India 's invoice and the environment of the environment and the old history of the noble nobile wild , which is a raziling concept in his simplicity or maybe we 're closer to the Earth .
Ingenes are not feeling or feeling .
There 's no space for these things in the malarithetic paludi or in the Tibet , but thank you very much nearly , but thank you to the race of the Earth 's not about the concept of being able to concept , but on an untremendous intuition of the world .
What does it mean ?
It means that a little boy of Ande who grows up to believe that the mountain is a spirit of Apu that will leave his destate is going to be human being deeply different and it 's going to have a very different human being being being deeply different with the mountain of Montana who grows up in the Montana is that the mountain of rock , which is a mountain of rock ,
That 's the dimadmural or a mineral cuts is irrelevant .
What 's interesting is the metaphor that debes the relationship between the individual and the natural world .
I grew up in the forests of Columbia , creating that forests were cut .
So , this resilient being different from my friends Kwautl who believe that the forests are the dimora of Hukuk and the bands of the paradise and the bage of the world , the wild beef that they live in the extreme of the world , spirites that they 're demand in the initiation of the world , the spirites that they 're going to be in the north of the world ,
If you start to consider that these cultures can create different reality , you can start to understand some of them feelings . We take this plant .
I 've taken this picture to open up in the nordoctor .
Mayahuash , the most powerful psychotive substance of the Smelt repertoire .
What makes it fascinating the ayahuasca is not the phones of the suit of the substance , but his elaboration . It 's composal by two elements .
On one hand , this liana launch that has a series of beta-carboline , harmolines , harmolines , and harmful , slightly hucinogenic and harmolines ,
Take the only plants , it 's a smoke that alterms a little bit of consciousness , but it 's measured with leaves of a coffee family , said Psychotria vision of coffee ,
This plant plant has powerful powerful powerful trippptamine-5 , a ptamine-5 , a methoxyptamine-five , a methoxydiptamine .
If you ever see Yanomami you 'll see the Yanomami pull on for the substance that they make by a different set of set of species , he contains methoxyltryptamine .
Tiring that dust is a little bit like being spread from a card of the card of the card dipinkles and land on a sweep . [ Risonate ] . Don 't create a distorsion of the reality ; it 's actually a dissolution of reality ;
I was going to come up with my professor , Richard Evan Shultes , the man who sent the baged was psychedelic , with his discovery of the fungi of the hallucinogens in the 1930s .
My mind mind you can 't put these tripptamines as hallucinogens as hallucinogens because if you 're done not told to be hallucinated . [ Risonous ] , it 's not being sunk because I 'm denial of a zyme , because I 'm densal of the zyme , and it 's obsesses .
It 's possible to be able to take the orgest of the chemicals that you know , of course , the MAO .
Now it 's the beautiful : betaa-carbolines that are in this liana are inhibitors in the MAO , the same type necessary to get tripptamines . The slowes spontaneous , in a flew of 80,000 species of plant , like these people found two morogically not similar , but that if you combine in this way , they make a biochemical version that 's superior to the superior to the sum of the suspspspspsport parts ?
We use the big eupherror and the mistake , which can reveal infruit .
But if we ask the Indians , they 'll tell us , " Does tell us . "
What does it mean ?
This tribes , the Cofan , has 17 varieties of ayahuash , which are nice narrow in the forest , and that our eyes would come into the species .
If we ask them how to stbilize their tassonomy to tell us , " I was thinking about the plants , and you don 't know everything ? " I said , " No .
The solution is : you take the 17 variety of a full and each cantery and each will canact with a different .
With this not graduate to Harvard , but it 's much more interesting to count the stamp .
Now , [ applausi , the problem is that even the people of the Ingens are being paintored in the world , and it 's a way redots to our margins of the history of the real world , and it 's beyond .
In fact , the 20th century , in 300 years , it 's not going to remind for his wars or innovations , but rather as the thing that we stopped and have actively embraced actively or accepted passionately or accepepted the destruction of the planet . Now the problem is not the change .
All the cultures through the centuries have been involved in a dance for new possibilities of life .
And the problem is not the technology .
The Indians Sioux , they don 't have to be Sioux when they put up the arco and they 're recepted by the hell and heavily .
It 's not the change or the technology that threatening the integrity of the ethnosphere . It 's the power .
The domination flight .
And if you give a look at the world , you 'll find that these are not destinated cultures .
They are living and dynamic creatures and dynamics out from the existence to the existence of the training of adaptation .
I know , you 're in the pathries in the pathries of Penan --
a popular nomad Sarawasian popular nomentioned in South earth , and now reduced to a generation ago , and now reduced to the servite and prostitution on the revers , where you can see the river in the back of the southern of the rivers , where you can see the river of the Meridional Meridional Meridional Meridional Meridional Meridional Meridionte , where you can sought ,
Woizing the wood stations with the dream of the forest .
Or , in the case of Yanomami , they 're the disease that I 've come with the discovery of the gold .
If we move on on on the mountains of Tibet , where I 'm doing a lot of research , you 'll see the hard flight flight .
As the genocide , the physics of a popular , it 's annocide to the walk , but the wild , the wild of life , not only is not just , but even celebrated in the conviction of the development of a popular , but even celebrated in certain environments , because it 's a part of the development .
And you can 't understand the suffering of Tibet until the beginning .
I 've been the 6,000 miles from Chengdu in Western Chengdu through the Tibet , and I come to Lhasa with a young colleague , but only arrived in Lhasa , I realized what 's behind the statistics we hear about .
6,000 sacres reducts in dust and core .
1.2 million people killed by military people killed by the military Revolution .
The father of this guy was ascriticized at the Panchen Lama .
which means that it was killed in the Chinese invasion .
Her , he was sitting with Sua Santity during the diaspora that has taken popular in Nepal .
Sua mother was imprigioned and his colpe was to be rich .
It was taken of hidden in the age of two deedges in the age of two , he would not have to live without him .
The sister , who did the same , it was put in reeducational reducation .
A day he inavailable of a day fascinating a coffiguring Mao and , for this transgression , was put on the seven-year-old jobs .
The Tibet of Tibet is being inoveroveroveroverlable , but the recenter of the popular people is from tener present .
And then , it 's all reduces a choice .
We want to live in the monoonia world of the monokeeping world policy or we want to account the world of diversity ?
The great paper Margaret Mead , before he died to die of the greatest fear was that , in our going to be able to this lower , we 're going to see the whole range of the world , not only we 'll see the whole range of human imagination , but a day we 'll see from a sleep off the , we 're going to death from a sleep , and we 're going to die from any other possibilities .
And it 's umillion of remembering that our species is existed for 600,000 years .
Neither Revolution , who gave us the agriculture , which made us underlighting to the seed of the skip with the prostype of the skip with the prostype of the skid , and we talk about 10,000 years ago .
The modern industrialized world has 300 years old .
That 's a story not suggest to me that we have the answers to all the challenges that we have to deal with the challenges that we 're going to deal with it .
When they 're going to these myries of cultures , they asked what it means to be humans , they respond with 10,000 different voices .
And it 's in these answers that we all all have the possibility to be what we are : a conscious species , which has to make all the people and all the gardens can fire . And there 's great moments .
I 've taken this picture on the North island of Baffin , when I went to the whales of the Inuit , and this man , Olaya , Olaya , and this man , Olaya , and this man , Olaya , and this man , Olaya , and this man , Olaya , and this man , Olaya , and this man , and this man , Olaya , and this man , Olayas I went to the grandfather with the grandfather .
The canachieves government wasn 't always gentle with the Inuit and the 1950s to store our sustabilized , we have them in colonies .
The grandfather of this man refused to go .
The family , I temonth , I 'll take him off all the guns , and all his cars .
You have to know that Inuit doesn 't temat the freeze , they disdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdish .
The packs in origin were made of fishes in the skin of the sleep .
The grandfather of this man didn 't make it in the arctic night or from the library , which was suffering .
It 's sgattaitholated , it was the pantalone in the skin and defecated in their hand . When they made them fecked , they worked on the sheep .
He spraying salive on the pointing of this cluem and when it became solid , he killed a dog .
He took the dog and created a brighter , with the hacic cassleep , he made a sleep , and he 's disappeared on the banks , and it 's disappeared on the banks , it 's a shell .
We want to talk about cavareas with nothing ? [ Raun] . ] And this , in different ways , [ Applausi is the symble of the Inuit and all the Ingenooowned popular of the world .
In the open-nine , 1999 , the canadvance of an area of the world land of an area of the largest California and Texas I put together .
It 's their new patria . It 's called Nunavut .
It 's an independent territory . They 're all the resources .
One examples of how a natione-state can recognize with his popular .
And , to finish , I think it 's pretty obvious at least to who we have been in these remote song on the planet , I realized that they 're not remote .
For somebody is home .
They represent source human imagination that sent up to the temple . And for all of us , the dreams of these children , like the dreams of our children , become part of the swide geography of hope .
And finally , we 're in National Geographic , we 're convinced that politicians will never come to anything .
We believe the polemithic --
[ Applausi is not persuasive , but we believe that stories can change the world , and maybe we 're the best institution to tell the stories of the world . EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEvery best institution to tell the stories of the world .

Thank you .
I 'm going to talk about some things that I wrote in this book that I hope to recall some other that you 've heard and proversus , in case you 're not noticed them .
I want to start with what I call the " dogma official dogma . "
The official dogma of what ?
The official dogma of all the Western industrial society , the western dogma , " If we want to massive well-being of our citizens . " " " The way to do it is massive , "
The reason is , from one hand , in the fact that freedom is in itself a value , is uful , useful , essential for humans .
Of the other is that if we 're free , each of us can act to do it for the well-being , without no one that you 're going to be , without no one that you 're going to name our well-being , without no one that you 're going to name .
The way to massive freedom is massive to massive choice .
More choices people have , the more lifeed , and greater is their well-being .
This , I think , is so deeply radicated in society that nobody would dream of putting it in the doubt .
And it 's also rooted in our lives .
I 'm going to show you some examples of what progress has made possible .
This is my supermarket . It 's not particularly big .
I lost a simple note about conditions .
In my supermarket is 175 conditions , without contesting 10 varieties of the oil extravergine , which you can buy for you a huge amount of conditions that nobody of the 175 of the room that nobody of the 175 of the ready is of your degrees .
So it 's the supermarket .
Then you go to the electronic store to buy a stereo : casse , you know , the lector , radio , piaright , amplificator .
And in this single electronic store , there 's a big number of components .
We can make six million and a half million different combinations , using the components that there are just a store .
You need to admit that there 's a lot of choice .
Other fields : the world of communications .
Once , when I was a child , you could get all the desire telephones that were fornites , at the breaks that were fornites , and they could get all the desire telephone .
He didn 't get the phone , you didn 't buy it .
One consequence of that , by the way , was that the telephone never break .
These days are gone .
We 've now almost illectures of telephones , especially between mobile phones .
Here 's the mobile phones of the future .
My favorite is the one in the middle , MP3 , cut of the nose , and foreign for me bruln-snap .
If you haven 't seen it in the store under the store under home , you 're well going to get .
And what happens is that people come in in the store and they do this question . And you know what the answer is , " No . "
It 's not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn 't do too much .
So , in other aspects of life that I 'm much more important than the aquists , you know , the same as the same as the opposite of choices .
Assistence health : no longer in the United States that you go from the doctor and the doctor you say what you have to do .
Instead , I go to the doctor and the doctor says , " OK , we could do A , or B , " A has these benefits and those risks . What do you want to do ? "
You say , " Dotic , what should I do ? "
And the doctor says , " You have these benefits and you have these benefits and you have these benefits . "
" What do you want to do ? "
And you say , " Dotic , if she was me , what would you do ? "
And the doctor : " But I 'm not . "
The result we call it " malia of malia , " , " expression that makes it look like this .
But it 's actually not that a move the weight and responsibility to make decisions from somebody knows something , which is the doctor , to someone else that doesn 't know -- and almost certainly , it 's sick -- and so not in the ideal condition to make the patient .
There 's a huge marketing of pharmaceutical marketing , direct to people like me and you , that if you think it 's not a sense , because we can 't buy them .
But if we can 't buy them , because there are public icizing ?
The answer is that they want to domorning called the doctor to ask him to ask him to change the recipe .
Something that 's the fundamental identity is a question of choice , as you see in this wish , " We don 't want to prove the children . You 're going to save their sex at at the right moment . " We don 't know more identity : we have to invent it .
And we can reinvented how many times we get it .
That means that every morning , you have to be decide that kind of person you want to be .
I 've been to family and marriage , a time perspective , a time perspective , which was that there was almost for anyone , it was that it married to the most soon possible , and it was that you can , and you start to get the most price possible .
The only real choice was with who , not when , and even when , and not , and even what do after .
Ose it , it 's really to play .
I teach to very smart students , and I do 20 percent in less than a time .
And it 's not because they 're brilliant , not because they 're less diligent .
but why I 'm impensive , I mean , I 'm going to married , " Would I say to me or not ? " Do I should do that ? "
" Do I should married me later ? I 've got to think before or career ? "
I 'm interrogative logorants .
And they try to answer these questions , even if this implica not complete the compete that I listen to the homework that I 'm going to be a vote to my examples .
And they have to do it . I 'm important questions .
Now , the work : we 're lucky , like , " because technology allows us to work , every day , every day , every day , from every corner of the planet , except that from the Hotel Randolph .
I 'm talking to the way , there 's a angle , and I 'm not going to tell anyone , where the WiFi works .
I don 't tell you , because I want to use it .
What does this mean , this incredible freedom of choice that we have about work ? It 's that we have to continue to decide , and we have to work or not .
We can go to see our son playing hot , with the mobile phone in a cell phone , the Blackberry in the other , and the news , typically , on the kberry .
And even if they are all spent , every minute we see our child dying , we 're also asking the game , we 're also asking this called ?
" Did I say to this email ? I 've got to get this letter ? "
And even when the answer is " no , " all this makes the experience of your child 's game of your son 's partity to be in other conditions .
So , anywhere we look , little , big and big , and big , materials and life , life is a question of choice .
Once the world was this : Of , there were some possibilities , but it wasn 't a question of choice .
The world of today is this : The dilemma is , " Is it a positive thing , or negative ? "
The answer is Sweather .
So , the positive latest ones we all know , so I 'm going to talk about negative those .
This is a choice compories of two effectively negative effects on people .
The first , the first , it 's that it 's parallel it .
With tant options between which choices , becomes very hard to do it .
I offer you an example : a conduct for the volunteer pensioning volunteer .
My colleague has had access to the Vange data , the junk society , the gigantic source society , with about a million clients in 2,000 different companies .
What she found was that for every 10 solutions that are offered in the most , the percentage of the adesion , two percent .
With 50 source offered , there 's 10 percent in less than adhhesions than only five . Why ?
Because with 50 fourds in the number of choices , it 's sick to decide , and choice is sent to be sent .
And tomorrow , and again , tomorrow , and tomorrow , and , of course , the tomorrow ,
You know , it doesn 't just mean that these old work from old people will send food for the source because they don 't have enough money , it also lose that the decision is so forgiven that the decision is so forgiven that the decision is so forgiven that the decision is so that they will lose the funds .
Not participating , they 're losing up to five dollars for the work , which is very well , it would be very much disposed to be .
So the paralysis a consequence of having too many choices .
And I think it makes the world like this .
" And to finish , " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " "
You 'd just take the right decision , if it 's for ethernity , right ?
You don 't want to choose the wrong fund , and you 're not going to choose to the wrong condition .
So this is the first effect . The second one is that even if we can avoid paralysis and make a choice , finally we 're less satisfied with less options of how we would have been with less options from which to choose .
And this is for different reasons .
One of these is that with many conditions between which choices , if you buy one and it 's not perfect , it 's easy to imagine that you could have been better . And what happens is that the alternative imaginate choice , and the return to the choice , and the return the choice , and the requires dies the soddisfenage of the choice , and the restage the recent decision ,
And when it was a good decision .
The more choices there are , easier to displeasure than any detail that 's insophister that it 's insophistective .
And also , there 's what economists call expensive opportunity .
Dan Gilbert has been very well stamattine like the value that we 're depending on what we confronted with .
And the rest , when there 's so many options , it 's easy to represent features of the alternative shot and be less satisfacts of the option that you 're chosen .
Here 's an example . I 've all schools I 'm not in New York .
But that 's what you would probably think .
There 's this copy to Hamptons .
A lussian place .
It 's all about splendida .
Not nothing . But what he thinks is , " Well , the eless , the way , it 's Agotten . "
" All my neighbors in Manhattan are off . "
" I could talk about it right in front of home . "
And it 's going to spend two weeks who 's losing -- every day -- the possibility of parking where it wants .
The constownership is decreased the satisfaction for what we have , even when the choice was excellent .
And the most are the options that we have to consider , the most attractive features will come back against how to cost opportunity .
Here 's another example .
This is telling us a lot of things .
It 's talking about living at the moment , and maybe living in the life-way .
But the most important point is that anything you 're going to choose to , you 're not doing other .
The things that we don 't choose to have a lot of attractive , which we can make less attractive what we do .
Third point : the growing of expectations .
I tried it on my skin buying a new jeans .
I 'm going to jeans .
Once the jeans were just just kind of , buy them and bestight , they were forced , just after you 'd bring them a life and work a lot of times , they were going to be good .
So , I went to buy a couple new when the old old old old old people were gone , and I said , " I need a couple of jeans , this is my cut . "
The commitment said , " Look , you want to fit , the fit , axed ? "
Do you want to have the cerniera or the buttons ? " Stonewashed , " or " acidasure ? "
" Do you want them to be layer ? "
" Do you want to take it or stretch ? Billbla -- " Contining it .
I was sbalored , and I was able to say , " I want to say , " I want to say , " I want to know , " I want to say , " You all try to me , and I tried to say , " I 'm going to get the best snice , I gain , I 'm going to be able to say , " I 'm going to be able to say , "
It was the massive . With all that I had the best .
But I felt worse .
Why ? I 've written a whole book to understand it .
The reason I was worse for is that with all that choice was that with all that choice were high , the jeans had to be perfect .
I was expectations . I didn 't expect anything exceptional , when there was just one guy saw one , but when there was 100 different , accidents , at least a type of it had to be perfect .
What I was I bought was good , but not perfect .
After I was talking about the chosen with what I was trying to do was satisfied in comparison .
The add of options in life , people don 't do that increases that these have respect to be options .
And this will be less satisfaction , even when the results are good .
Nobody in the world of marketing , they realized .
Because if they knew , you 're not aware of what I 'm talking about .
The truth looks more at this .
" It was better when it was worse , " The reason that was better when it was worse was that when it was worse to be worse to meet surprised .
Ost , the world in which we live in -- opulent , industrialized citizens with the expectancy of the performation -- the maximum that we can hope is that things are on the height of expectations .
You never have pleasure pleasure , because your expectations , my expectations , they 're ingigantic .
The secret of happiness -- what you 're here -- is , " Baxy expectations . "
I mean , I 'm self-wheel -- which I really married and my wife is really amazing .
I couldn 't have done , I couldn 't have been accounted .
But it 's not always a bad thing .
And then , finally , a consequence of buy jeans when there 's just that jeans is that when you 're not satisfacts , and you say , " Why ? "
" Who is responsible ? " , the answer is clear .
The world is responsible . What can I do with it ?
When there are hundreds of kinds of jeans , and you buy a satisfacing , and ask you who ask you who is responsible , it 's the clear , it 's the good , it 's you .
You could do better .
With hundreds of varieties of varieties , there are no excuse for insuccess .
So when people take decisions , even if the outcome is , they feel like , they 're satissssatissssatissssatissssatisssettes and they give the hit it .
In the last few years , the depression is exploded in industrialized world .
I think a factor -- not the only one , but important -- this is that it 's really important -- of this honate of depression is that people have deludents because it standard are too high .
And when they have to explain this situation they think that the colpe is they think .
So the final result is that we 're general result , objectively , but we hear worse .
Let me remember it remind you .
This is the official dogma , what we all take for buy and it 's completely fake .
There 's no doubt that a little bit of choice is better than to have it , but it 's not a little bit of choice is better than a little bit .
There 's a critical value , magic . I don 't know what it is .
But I 'm sure we 've been enough to be that we 've been doing this for our life .
Now , from the politician -- I almost finished -- from the politician , the pel 's standpoint .
What allows all this choice in industrial society is the wealth .
There are many places in the world , and you know , you know , where the problem is not that they have a choice .
The problem is they have too poca .
So the flusive factory I 'm talking about is a malbeing exclusive of modern , Western society .
And what it makes you depress and climbs this : Steve Levitt has talked to you yesterday about how expensive and discovered in the basic bies are inuseful .
I mean that these choices , complicated and available , it 's not that they 're just unuseful .
I 'm even deleteries .
They 're worse .
If it 's a little bit of what in our society , it allows a little bit of reversed in those where people have too much possibilities , it would not just their life to improve but our .
This is what economists call a paretian improvement .
A redistribution of income redistribution is all good -- not only to poor -- because of this choice in excess that it 's going to take .
So , to conclude , " Filill , you can become everything you want " --
You , people in culture , you think , " But what does it believe that fish ? "
" It 's obvious that you can 't make anything in a box . "
" A recastrateful , a world of limited vision --
and I 've interpret this , at the beginning .
But then , I realized that , instead , I realized that that the fish knows the long knows .
Because the reality of the facts is that if you send in the box , so that " all of it is possible , you can 't get the freedom . You get the paralysis .
If you break the box in a way that all the decrease of satisfaction .
You can get the paralysis , and you 're going to reduce .
Everybody needs a sphere .
This is almost certainly too close , maybe even for the fish , and it 's certainly about us .
But the absence of a few symbolic symbolic symbolicity and , I 'm afraid , for the ruin .
Thank you very much .
