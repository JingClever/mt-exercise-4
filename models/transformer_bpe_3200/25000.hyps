Last year , I showed these slides to demonstrate that the next calottc calottica , which for almost three million years had the 48 dimensions of 48 continental .
But this subvalue the gravity of the problem because it doesn 't show the payer of the ice .
The Arctic calotter is , in a certain sense , the clear heart of global climate system .
You go out and winter and you extreme on summer .
The next slide will be a quick related to the advent of the last 25 years .
The persilly reported .
As you see , they 're expanded to the blue scall .
That 's the ice in winter , which is ritions of summer .
You can see that cosidamage , five years or more , is like blood , which is like blood , which is like blood , which is like blood .
In 25 years , it 's been over for that .
This is a problem because the heavily heavily , the ice ice ice , where I have huge amounts of carbon congled that , and they 're transformed in the metane .
Right to the totality of the atmospheres to global warming , that amount could doubled , super-scale , super-scale .
In some deep deep in Alaska metane is already rebolling by water .
The professor Katey Walter of Alaska University of Alaska team has been taken with a team of a fast-down , the winter .
Video : Wow ! Al Gore : Wow ! You 're going to be good .
One reason is that this termundy-scale exchange .
This is a glacial regime .
Supupupon it had never reached to levels .
This is the Kangerlussuaq , in the southwest of Groenland .
If you want to know how to be the sea level for the melting of the ice of the ice on terrafertiones , here is where the sea .
These currently are increasing .
At the other part of the planet : Antarctica , the largest block of the planet .
The last month scientist have dichieved that the billate of ice is in negative , and that the Western Antarctica , which points on some islands , is particularly quickly in the month .
It 's six feet to six feet of the water , like in Groenland .
Sulla Himalayas , the third larger block of ice , you see new laghi , which few years ago ,
40 percent of the world population will be half of the world population will be able to get away .
Sulle Ande : this ice is the source of the pop of water .
The landed has increased .
But when it 's decrease , the same happens to the water .
In California , the nenow on Sierra Nevada is diminured 40 percent .
The idricium are in crisis .
The predictions , as you have been able .
Since for sure , the world leads to a remarkable increase .
The environmental disastern disaster out of the normal and unprecedented .
Four times more numbers in the last 30 years , respect 75 .
This is a whole winguess .
If you look at the historic context if you can see the consequences .
In the last five years , we 've added 70 million tons of CO2 every 24 hours -- 25 million tons in the ocean every day .
Look at the East Pacific area , from the Americas , to the west , to walk in the parts of the substant continent , where there 's a radical impoverty . And you know , you know , it 's a radical impoverty in the ocean .
The major causes global warming , together with deforestation , which is 20 percent , is the fossil fuels .
Or is the problem , and carbon is even worse .
The United States is one of the two more emissions , together to China .
And he proposed to build a lot of other carbon cents .
But we 're seeing a way of a direction change .
These are the anulturally projects in the last few years and some green alternative alternative projects .
And so , there 's a political fight in our country .
The carbon industry and oil suspent 250 million dollars in the last year to promote carbon , which is a bsign .
I remember something that I remember in this --
Verice Natale , in Tennessee , where I live , there was a 3.8 billion ligallons of carbon flows .
Maybe you saw it on news .
This is the second larger flow of flowing in America .
It happened around Natal .
The Nalization of one of the carbon industry was this .
Video : Srom the carbon is a kind of allegro and happy .
It 's abundant here in America , and it growing our economy .
From carbon is more and more and more and more and more and more .
It 's good price , adorable and workers keep the stypend .
Al Gore : From here is a lot of the West Virginia .
The bigger minerair on the mountain is Massey Coal . This is his administrator .
Video : Don Blankenship : I 'll be clear -- Al Gore , Nancy Pelious , Nancy Pelist , they 're not going to know what they 're talking about .
Al Gore : So the Alleance for Proteition of Clima has launched two campaign .
This is a one of them , one part .
Video : Acore : Alla COALergy , we see climate change as a sery tack-up business .
So , our priority is to invest a lot of money in a effort to make public and confused the vertising of carbon .
In fact , carbon is not sporrow .
We think it 's clean -- it 's also a good prosmoke .
So , not preocues of climate change .
Let me do it to us .
Video : Cbone : Carbone -- you heard a lot of it .
So let 's take a turn into a structure to the horrise of the pulit .
Straordinary ! The machines are a little rumorous , but that 's the sound of carbon technology .
The carbon consumption is between main the main causes of global warming , but the remarkable technology of global carbon that you see changing everything .
Date a look at : this is the clean hated carbon odiernal technology .
Al Gore : So , the positive alternative , positive alternational security .
Video : Comment : National security , the national security , climate crash .
The whose connects all : our dependence from fossil fuels , like the sporco and oil oil oil practice .
Now , there 's a new , audace , audace solution to go out .
Repower : 100 percent clean energy , in 10 years .
A plan to reput the America to work , make sure more certainly , and help stop global warming .
Finally , a solution that is basts to solve our problems .
Reforming America . Scoprite more .
Al Gore : This is the last .
Video : Comment : It 's about rest to America .
One of the fastest ways to bring the dependence to dependence from combustible to kill our planet .
So , the future is here . Vent , a new energy network .
Novi investments for two : Negi investments for a bone-retribute .
Comment : Repower . It 's time to be reality .
Al Gore : A old proverbio 's old proverbio , you 're going to go to fast .
If you want to go away , you go together . "
We need to go away , fast .
Thank you very much .
LHC : Last year at TED , we 've got a introduction on the LHC .
And promise to get back to get back to how the machine works .
So here I was there . And for those that the other time , the LHC is the biggest scientific experiment ever they were so much in -- 27 kilometers of circircircircircircircircircuit .
His compitable to recall the conditions that were at less than a billion of a billion of second from the universe -- until 600 million of the universe .
All of that 's just ambiitious .
This is the machine under Ginevra .
We 're going to have these min-Big Bang inside the releveveventually .
This is what it 's working . It 's called ATLAS -- is about 44 feet and has a diameter to 22 meters .
This is a spectacular picture of ATLAS in built so you can see the proportions .
Ten September 10 to the first time we have acceso the machine for the first time .
And this picture was taken by ATLAS .
It was because of immense festeggiving in control .
It 's an image of the first particles that had done all the LHC , in collision , in collision , with a part of the LHC , and spread particles inside the relevant .
In other words , when we see that picture 10 to september , we knew that the machine was going on , which is a great witory .
I don 't know if it was going to do it to do it more or this , when someone went on on Google and saw that the page was this .
That means we have had a cultural impact on the scientific impact .
About a week later , there was a problem with the car , had to have right here -- these files here -- these files .
These flyes 13,000 leaving when the machine works at the massive of power .
Now , the technical between you will look at the files and say , " It 's not true . I 'm very overoverwhelmed . "
And they can do it because when they 're very cosiating cosiating super-flew super-conflicts .
So , at least 271 degrees , at a temperature of the space between stars , these files can bring that run that running .
In one of the juntures of the most novemile magneti in the LHC , there was a defect of fed .
So the file fixed up , and 13,000 herself improvised an electricity .
This was the result .
Now , this is even more impressive if you think that these magneti fish more than 20 tons , and that have been moved about 30 centimeters .
They 're damaged about 50 magneti .
We had to take them , what we did .
We restinated them and enhanced .
Now they 're coming back to the subland .
By the end of march the LHC is will be again integral .
We 're going to access it , and we expect to get the data or the bunch or that we 're going to keep our adventure to find out what are the morning I 'm going to get the universe .
Now , of course , in a certain way , these accidents reaccended up the debate on the value of science and engineering in front of science and engineering in front of science and engineering in front . It 's easy to confuture .
I think the fact that it 's so hard , the fact that I think it 's the value of things like LHC .
I 'd like to end with the words of a English scientist , Humphrey , which , I suppose , in defense of inuseful experiments of his pupile , his pupile was Michael Faraday , said , " Nist so dangerous for progress of human mind how the rent one that the reverse of the human mind that the reversus of science is definitive to our triual nature , and that 's not . "
Thank you .
I want to start asking you to rethink about when , kids , you played cocococococow .
While you understand how to reach them and to take them and to get them and get them , learn to be able to think and solve problems with and spacecrails .
The space reasoning is deeply connected to the way we understand a lot of the world around us .
So , as an inspirate from the uity of our physical objects , together to my consultant Packs , and my collaborator Jeevan Kalanithi , I started to ask myself , " And if , when we use a computer , instead of having the only cursor of mouse as a digital pollyroat , we could actually trust a bunch , we could actually trust an information with both hands , with hands ,
and how do it to do it ?
The question was so interesting we decided to explore the answer , building Siftable .
In a few words , a Siftable is a big computer interactive as a biscope .
In a few words , a Siftable is a big computer interactive as a biscope .
You can move them with your hand , can " see " between them , " You can see " movement , and they have a screen and a wireless .
But in fact , I 'm physical objects like the morning , you can just move to to be mistake .
The Siftable is the example of a new ecosystem of tools to manipulate digital information .
And as they become more physical , conscious of the right movement , of others , and as they become more physical , and other , and as we can explore new things , we can explore new things that we can explore new and fun and fun and fun and fun and fun of interaction .
I 'll start with some simple example .
This Siftable is configured to show video of video : if you 're going to stop it in a direction , video is going to be like that , if you 're going back to the other side .
These interactive ritates are aware of other .
If you face them , they 're interested in what they 're interested in what they 're all around .
If they 're surrounded , they can see it and they can do it a little bit .
If they 're surrounded , they can see it and they can do it a little bit .
They also greatly their movement and inches .
And then we realized that one of the interests of the most implications of the interaction was to be able to use managed to the data , for example , " a liquid . "
In this case , we have three Siftable as a bucks of vernice and I can use them to fix the color in that central , where they mix .
and I can use them to fix in the middle , where they 're missed .
We can do too , we can put a little bit in place .
I 'm also beautiful possibility of learning , like language , like language , the mathematics and logic games where people can try to do things fast , and see the result of the result .
I 'm going to --
This is a Fibonactic sequence I do with a mathematics program .
Here we have a game of words that 's in half of Scarabeo and Boble .
Pratically , at all the towrote a letter to every Siftable , Pratically , at every Sifable , Pratically , at every Sifable to you , and while you 're trying to buy a letter to a dictionary .
Then , after about 30 seconds they 're remissed , and you have a new letter set of reading and new possibility to try .
Thank you .
That 's the children came to the Media Lab , I made them out and I went into a video .
They 're very pleased .
And one of the interesting things that kind of applied is that you don 't have to give people a lot of instructions .
You just say , " Compons of words , and they know exactly what to do .
That 's what we 're trying to do it .
This is our youngstage , there on the right .
It was actually wanted to impilling them .
They 're only morning morning , for him .
Now , this is a appliation of a interactive chart .
And we wanted to build a tool for the launch of language Lui is Felix .
It can insert new characters in the scene , by lifting Siftable .
It can insert new characters in the scene , by lifting Siftable .
So , it 's going to get out .
Video : Sun is smile .
David Merrill : Now he took a treat a trewer in the scene .
Video : The treat treat treat .
Bel work ! Yeah !
So , you know , you can put up the Siftable and close close to interact the characters --
Video : Bau !
-- inventing their own story .
Video : Hey !
DM : It 's a story with final open , and it can decide him how it comes .
DM : It 's a story with final open , and it can decide him how it comes .
Video : Vola on , cat .
DM : The last example I have time to show you is a tool , is made of recent , to campioning and exeguing music .
It 's a tool , I 've done recently , to tramong music and to be able to be able to be able to do it .
Siftable here on sounds like basic , low-and bacteria .
Each one of these has four different variations , and you can choose what to use .
You can also put these sounds into a sequence that you can also get to pleasure .
And I just just just by making touch a sound and a sequence . "
These are actually actually you can control from the live , like reverbero and filter .
It 's attacks to a particular sound and then inclens to enjoyed it .
And then there are the general effects as time and volume , and they 're applied to the entire sequence .
Let 's look at how it works .
Video : We 're going to start with a set in two Siftable sequence , we 're going to put it in a series , we 're going to add other basic .
Now I put a basis line .
Video : DM : Now , I add percussions --
Video : DM : And I 'll put the filter to bacteria , so I can control the effect from the live .
Video : I can be able to be able to queen the whole sequence on the other side , or on the other .
Video : DM : And I 'm going to add the low-fairly to give more expression .
Video : I can recombine the sequence to flight .
So I don 't have to planning it before , but I can improvisate , making it longer or .
And now , finally , I can spring the whole sequence on the left Siftable .
Thank you .
So , you can see , my passion is to build new new new interfaces to be more and more soembranches like to work our brain and body .
And today , I had time to show you one of the result of this path , and some possibility that we 're trying to bring out of the lab .
The concept I want to transmit is that 's coming to this new generation of designed to interact with digital digital media , which will bring information in our world in the way we want .
Thank you very much .
I don 't see the time to talk to all of you .
I 'm a writing .
Sweriving books is my profession , but it 's more than that , of course .
It 's also love and the cine of my life .
And I don 't expect to change .
But , I said , something particularly happened in my life and in my career , which led me to recently me the whole relationship with this work .
The particular thing is that I 've been wrote this book , this biography called " Manie , " Ama , " which , " is , " What , diversly by my precedented books , for some reason I was used to use in the world and became a great , best-international ,
And the result is that everywhere to be now , people treat me as if I was conconconvicted .
Really -- you know , you 're convicted .
They 're all right now all worried and they say , " You have no fear to do better ?
Do you have no fear to keep writing for all life without able to create a book that can important to someone ? "
What can you be importance to someone ? "
It 's certainly , you know .
But it could go worse , part of the result I remember that more than 20 years ago , when I started to say , I was a teenager -- I wanted to be a wrote -- I wanted to be a wrote .
I was going to injumped by fear .
And people said , " Don 't I could not do it successed ?
Do you have to do you fear that the umillion of you refed ?
Do you have to do this mestive for all life without anything out there , and to die on a cumultacy of dreaming with the mouth of the pile to share the framing of failure ? "
So , you know .
The answer to all of these questions is , " Yeah . "
Yeah , I 'm fear to all of those things .
I always had fear .
And I also fear some other things that people can 't inguess .
As the algae and other spaventing .
But , for the way I was writing what I thought and I would ask myself , but I would say that ,
Irational ?
It 's logical that anybody should wait to be spended by a work that 's born to do .
But what 's so particular in the creative impress that makes us nervous nervous health of mental health , in a way that other people don 't do ?
How my father , for example , he was a chemistry engineer and I don 't remember one time in his 40 years of activity that he was asked if he was asked if he was asked if he was doing it to be able to be able to engineer capita ?
There was never -- that block of engineer John , how does it go ?
Don 't work so , you know ?
Onestly , chemicals like group not have any of , in the centuries , waradagned the reputation of being alcofied .
We have enough writers , we have enough this reputation , and not only writers , but creativity of all kinds of instacks , we have this reputation of being enormous .
And it 's not to look at the sad of the magnify of the magnifetime of creative minds , in the twentiet-century , they die young and often died young people .
And even the ones that don 't have to be suicide by their dundings .
Norman Mailer , before he died , in the last interview , said , " Every my book killed me a little more " than a little more " than a deal with their life .
But we don 't do it , because we heard that because we 've heard these things so long that in some way we have completely interiorized and accepted the notion that creativity and suffering are somehow tied and suffering are somehow tie and the art , it will always take the angue .
And the question I want to take to all of here today is : are you agree with this idea ?
It 's good for you -- because even look at the centimeter of a distance to me not good for all this supposition .
I think it 's odious .
And I think it 's also dangerous and I don 't want to see the perpetuated in the next century .
I think it 's better encourage our big creative minds to live .
And I certainly know that , in my case -- in my situation -- it would be very dangerous to start smoke up to that feel like the dark of suppopointing the circuit that I 'm in my career .
That 's true -- I mean , I 'm pretty young , I have about 40 years .
I 've got about four work decacades .
And it 's very likely that anything writing in the world , as the work that came out of the world as the work that came out of my last book .
I 'm going to be slaveholding , because we 're all more or less friends here -- it 's likely that my greatest success is to my shoulder .
Oh , Gesus , thought ,
You know , this is the kind of thinking that leads a person to start to drink in the nine of the morning and I don 't want to do it .
I 'll keep going to keep doing this work that we love .
So , the question is , what ?
And so it seems , after many reflections , that the way to keep writing is to create a psychological costruction , OK ?
I have to find a way to find a distance of security between me , which I 'm writing , and my natural anxion that , which is going to be able to get it . And I was trying to do it by looking through time , trying to find other society to see if they could have more and more ununless and see if they could have more and more sane ideas to see if they could have more and more sane ideas to see if they could have to get more and more ununlike that I was wrote ,
about how to help people with creative people manage to manage the emotional sich emotivity .
And that research has taken me to the old Grek and old Rome .
Seguitem because it 's giving me in your eye and then back .
In Grek Grek and ancient Rome -- people didn 't seem to believe that creativity was from men , OK ?
It was thought that creativity was this spirit look at the same as a few people who come to the men from some kind of distant and unknown , for distant reasons and known , for distant reasons .
The Green greats were called these spiriters of creativity demons .
Socrate , wonderful , believed to have a lift that elargness from far away .
The Rooms were the same idea , but they called the kind of spirit without a genius .
Which is great , because Roands didn 't think that a genius was particularly intelligent .
They believe that a genius was this kind of devine that had been living in the mural walls of a artist 's studio , a little bit like the elpho Dobby , and that they were out of hidden the job of the artist 's work of the artist and modeling the result of that the artist of that work .
Here 's the same -- here 's the distance of which I 'm talking -- that 's the psychological construction that you protected from your work .
And everybody knew that it was so that it worked , right ?
So , the antiks were protected to certain things , like , for example , too too much narcisism , right ?
If your work was exceptional , you couldn 't take all the place , all the knowledge that you could have been helped this genius .
If your failed work , it wasn 't your whole , right ?
Everybody knew that it was your genius to be a inable .
And so people han conceived creativity in Occies for a long time .
Then the Rinascivent came and everything changed , and it was born , and we 're going to be the human center of the universe above all the mysteries and no longer leave space creatures that they write by divinity .
This was the rational principles and the people started thinking that creativity was completely from the ight .
And for the first time in history , you start to refit to refer to this or artist as a genius rather than a person with genius .
And I have to tell you , I think it was a big error .
I think I allow someone , a simple person to believe that it 's a recipient like a source , the essence and the source of all the mysteries , creativity , unknowable and etheran indeed with the fragile of human psychologists .
It 's like to ask someone to enjoy the sun .
Deform and destores completely completely the egos and creates all these inexhibition on performance .
And I think it 's been this pressure to have the artists in the past 500 years .
And , if that 's true , and I think it 's true , and I think it 's , and now ?
Can we do it .
Maybe come back to a more ancient understanding of the relationship between human and creative mystery .
Or maybe not .
Maybe we can 't cell 500 years of rational thinking about about 18 minutes in a demand .
And there 's probably people in the audience that would be reading the scientific subjects on the news , they 're going to make the news of the news , they follow the people to spend on their projects .
I 'm probably not going to convince you all about this thing .
But the question I want to ask is -- why not ?
Why don 't we think about this way ?
Because it 's more sense of anything that I 've ever heard to explain the exabsolutely explained the exasperant process .
A process that , as anybody ever tried to do something -- so , basically , all of here -- you don 't know , you don 't compored rationally .
And , in fact , it can sometimes seem completely paranormous .
I did this meeting recently with the extraordinary poetry Ruth Stone , who has 90 years , but he was a poetry for all life and told me that during his childhood in the rural Virginia , worked out in the camps , and he felt out , in if a poem was in if I was a poetry .
He said it was like a fragorous train of the air .
And that was roolding to her from the landscape .
He felt that , because he was to tremendous , because he was going to tremendous .
He knew I had one thing to do at that point and was of , words , " running like a match . "
And so he goes to the house and it was sitting on this poetry , and it wouldn 't have any other than taking a piece of paper and a math enough fast , and a math enough fast , and it would take it on the page .
Sometimes he couldn 't be fast enough , so he was going to fast enough and correcish and he wouldn 't get to the house and poetry her rotoling through and she loved and she would continue to rotolate through the landscape , looking for , as she said , " another poet . "
Then there were those times -- this piece I 'm not going to dementize -- there were almost losing , OK ?
So , he was running at home and he was looking for the card and poetry was going through , and she was going through , and then she was going , and then she said , that it was like if you 're sungled with the other hand and then he was looking at the house and he was looking for the other hand , and then he was looking at the house and then she was looking at the house and then she was looking at the house and she was looking for the downnnside , and then she was looking at the house , and then she was going to go to the house , and then she said ,
He had the poetry from the coda and remaining her body and he was going to get it on the page .
And in these cases , the poetry would be presented on the perfectly and intact but to the contrast , from the last word to the first .
So when I felt , I was very excited , it 's exactly exactly equal to my creative process .
Not all my creative process -- I 'm not a conviction .
I 'm a mulo , and my way to work is ; I can wake up in the same orary every day and work and pass over the horarian .
But even I 'm going to have to my headphones , I 've been striped with that , sometimes .
And I guess that many of you have the han made .
You know , even though the work and ideas came to me from a certain source , not , you can know .
And what is this thing ?
And how can we relate to it in a way that we don 't lose your head , but rather , rather , that , that makes us stay ?
For me , the best example of the contemporary example I have is the musicist Tom Waits , which I 've interviewed several years ago for a newspaper .
We were talking about this , and you know , Tom , for the majority of life was the incarnation of the board , looking for control , to dominate , trying to control these species of impulses .
But then I 'm going to invite , and one day while he was driving on a car in L.A. , changed all over .
He was going to fast and everything with a little framework of melody fragment , which comes in his head as the inspiration , it comes to her head as the inspiration , and it 's got , you know , and it doesn 't know how to take it .
It 's got no paper , it doesn 't have a match , it doesn 't have a match .
So he starts to feel this species of old , and he 'll be able to lose , " I 'm going to lose , and I 'm going to lose , and I 'll remart obsessed by this song , and I 'm going to lose it ,
I 'm not good enough and I can 't do it . "
And instead of going to go to the panic ,
I 'll be able to interior process and he made something completely new .
I just just just the sky and he said , " Scuses , I don 't see that I 'm driving ? "
" To you think it can write a song hour ?
If you really want to existence , back in a more opporter , when I can take care of you .
To trial , you go to importounce somebody else today .
I went to disturbing Leonard Cohen . "
And his process changed after that .
Not the work , the work was still dark .
But the process , and the heavy anxiety that was releft when he was releft when the genius , the genius that was going to be standle back to the other problems , and they were doing it back from where , he was doing , he had no interized and fying it .
but you know this peculiar , wonderful bizarre collaboration between Tom and this strange and this strange and outside that it was not Tom .
So , I felt that story started to change a little bit even the way I worked and I had already saved it .
This idea , I was saved when I was writing " Manie , " Ama , and it fall in one of those cave disperation that we 're all working on something and we can 't do it and we can start thinking that will be a disaster , which is going to be a disaster , which is the worst book written .
Not only bad , right , right the worst book written .
And I started thinking about therefore I started to throw this project .
But then I remember about Tom , I was talking to the air and I tried to it .
So I stood up my face on the darkness and I was made to a vacuum of room .
And I said , " Sests , what , you 're both going to know , if this book is not going to be brilliant not going to be brilliant , no , no ?
Because I 'm going to see it all I have , I don 't have any more than that .
So if you want to be better , you have to presenter and do your part .
OK . But if you don 't do it , you know what , I don 't do it .
I 'm going to write the same because it 's my work .
And I want to do my part of the favor that was recorded I 've presented to do my part , " Because -- at the end is so , OK -- it 's going -- it 's going to be in the North Africa 's 's damances and music that would go forward to the dance and the housing to the stuff .
And they were always magnify because the ballerins were professionals and they were fantastic .
But every single , rarely , something happened , and one of these artists became transcendent .
And I know you know what I 'm talking , because I know you 've seen , at some point , a performance so .
It was as if the time , and the dancer walked through a kind of land-up , and it wasn 't doing anything different from the solved , like 1,000 night before , but all it was all all all ineated .
And suddenly , not just appeared as a human .
But it 's accese from the divinity of the divinity of divinity .
And when this happened , when it was , the people knew what was , they were called him .
They were congave their hands and started to sing , " Allah , Allah , God , God , " God , " God , " God , "
That 's God , you know .
Curious note -- when the Mori invaded the south of Spain , I preserved this habitude with them and the pronounced in the centuries of " Allah , " Ole , Allah , " Ole , " Ole , " Ole , " , " which you can still hear in the courage .
In Spain , when a artist did something impossible and magic , " Allah , , the , Allah , , By , , I mean , " incomprehensible , it 's a last .
And it 's great because we need .
But , the problem comes next day , for the dancer , at the same , when you wake up and find that are 11 in the morning of Martedday and last last last God was no longer .
It 's just a mortal with a gran bad , and perhaps it will never get to sell that altitude .
And maybe nobody will be the name of God , and what does with the rest of his life ?
It 's hard .
This is one of the most paorous recognizations to do in a creative life .
But perhaps it doesn 't have to be so anguess if you can 't believe , in the most extraordinary aspects of your being being from yourself .
But you think you 're just going to be a deal with a inimaginable source of this team you have to go through somebody else when you finished .
And , you know , if we think it 's all changes .
And so I started thinking about it , and it 's certainly how I thought I think about several months during the work of the book that I 'll be going to do , the dangerous , it 's very successful .
And what I have to keep telling me when I feel eljournal .
Not just just like your work .
Continua present-the-present-the-hit , any can be .
If your work is dancing , bat .
If the dvine , absurd on you to take some kind of wonderful to leave a few kinds of wonderful , for a moment through your efforts , then " Ole . "
To you have to do the same dance .
And " Ole ! " to yourself .
I think , and I think it 's got to teach it .
" Ole ! " to yourself , even for having a human and wild headtal tarts to be able to be able to introduce you to keep a continuously .
Thank you .
Thank you .
June Cohen : Ole !
As I 've already talked about some of these projects on the human genome about what can mean and on the discovery of genes .
Now we 're starting a new percourse : we started to digitize biology and now we started to digital the digital code we 're going to start to a new phase of biology , design and synthetization .
We always tried to bring great questions .
What 's life ? " is something that many biologists have tried to understand the livelihood that I think they 're free to get livelihood .
We tried different approaches , reduced it to minims .
We 're digitializing by almost 20 years .
When we sequenced the human genome was to spend from the analome of the biology of the computer .
Now , we can regenerate life , or can we regenerate life , or to create new life from this digital universe ?
This is the map of a small organism , Mycoplasma geny-genycoplasma , which is the smallest genome of the small genius of the ones that can authorem in the lab .
And we tried to reduce the genome to create smaller .
We 're able to eliminate a hundred genes of about 500 .
But when we look at his fooled metabolic map , it 's relatively simple respect to our .
I believe that 's simple .
But when we look at all the genes that we can eliminate , one at the time , it 's very unlikely that this can bring a living cells .
So we decided that the only way to progreded this chromosoma to be synthesize this chromosoma in a way that could bring some of these fundamental questions .
And so we started the adventure of " can we mean a chromosome ? "
Can you feel like chemistry to make these big molecules that we never had to create before ?
And , in case , we can make a chromosome ?
A chromosome is just a piece of inert chemical chemical material .
The speed that we 're going to digitize life is growing to reponential .
Our ability to write the genetic code , instead , proproproproproproproproproproproproproproproposing .
And our most recent results the result of the exponential curve .
We started more than 15 years ago .
The process required many steps , starting with bioethical revision , first experiments .
But we found that synthesize DNA is very difficult .
There are tens of thousands of machines in the world that produce small segments of DNA , over 30-lastness , and it 's a degenerative process : the more the segment , the more than the segment is long , there are .
So we had to develop a new method to assemble these framments and correcrecting the mistakes .
And that 's our first attempt , to start digital information of Phi genome 174 .
It 's a little virus that kills bacterial .
We designed the fragments , actually , the correction of errors and get a DNA molecule of about 5,000 letters .
The interesting part is when we took this piece of the chemical material that 's inert , and we put it in bacterial , and we put it in bacteria , and we got it into the bacterial particles .
The viral particles have been released by the cells , they 're back and they destroyed .
I talked about recent with the oil industry is saying they 're certainly understanding that their own model .
They have more than you .
We believe that this is a situation where software can actually build his same hardware in a biological system .
But we wanted to do things in big .
We wanted to build the whole chromosome of bacteria .
They 're more than 580 thousand letters of genetic code .
So we thought we made it in the cassette of viruses , so that we can change the cassets to understand what are the components of a living cells .
Sdesigning is crucial , and if we start with digital information in a computer , these must be very accurate .
When we sequenced this genome for the first time in 1995 , the standard was of a mistake for every 10 thousand .
We found out , we were 30 errors . If we had to use that original sequence would never be able to do it work .
One part of the process is design that we can design over 50 letters that sub-stanti-launch with all other segments of 50 letters to build subunits small subunits that work together .
Let 's try to get unique elements here .
You probably read that you 're probably read that we inseries of the filigry .
So , we think , we have a genetic code on four letters : A , C , G and TG and .
Three of those letters are mit together about 20 friend , and there 's a specific order to read about 20 friend of reading to read for every friend .
So we can use genetic code to write words , frasases , thinking .
What we did at the beginning was autographed .
Some have been deluss from the fact that it wasn 't poetry .
We designed these segments to just unit with me .
There are them that are repair them and put them on .
And we started assemble with parts , starting with segments from five to seven mile , and unending them up to a segments of 24 thousand and feet to get to get to 72 mile mile .
Each step , we made these segments in abundance so that we 're trying to build an extremely robustoking -- as you 'll see in a minute .
We 're trying to automatize the process .
So , this seems the tabellon a lowket playground .
When we get these very long , much more than 100 thousand low-down , they 're not going to grow more directly in E.
It comes to the modern of modern biology molecular biology .
So we 've been considered other mechanisms .
We knew about another mechanism called omologue recombination , that in biology to repair the DNA to repair the DNA to be able to unit the segments .
So , here 's an example .
This organism , called Deinojournal , can absorbs three million radiation .
You can see in high high school , as his chromosome as the cross-up .
In 12 -- 24 hours comes riassembled exactly as it was before .
There are thousands of organisms that are able to do it .
These organisms can sit completely .
They can live under vacuum .
I 'm absolutely sure life existing in space , and you feel to find new rich water .
In fact , NASA showed that this is .
This is a picture of molecule we built with these processes , just using the lifetime with the segments of segments to insert .
Sylived them self-assemble .
This picture wasn 't taken with a microscope , but with a microscope , but with a microscope .
It 's a molecule so big we can see with a microscope .
These are pictures that cost a time of about six seconds .
This is the publishing we did a little time ago .
They 're more than 580,000 letters of genetic code .
It 's the largest molecules of a defined structure that man .
It 's got a 300 million indeed with 300 million .
If you stamp it with a 10 without spaces , they would like 142 page to transcracy .
Now , how do we do it work ? How can we do that ?
Of course , we 're tramed a virus is game .
It 's a little bit more complicated when you use bacterial .
It 's easier when it 's about cells as we do eucariote like our : you can just extract nucleo and put another , which is basically the process of cloning .
In the bacterium , the chromosome is , but we 're recently demonstrated that we 're able to do a complete tradition of a chromosome from a cell chromosome from a cell chromosome , to another and to activate it .
We clear a chromosome with a microbial species .
The two are different as men from the topes .
We 've added some gene in a way that we can decide what to choice for this chromosome .
And then , I 'm skip with the enables that you can kill all the proteins .
And when we put it in the cells was study -- and you 'll appreciate our sophisticatomic graphics -- the new chromosome -- the new chromosophisticated in the cells .
And we started thinking that we couldn 't go beyond , but we tried to get more in there .
This is one of the major mechanisms of evolution .
We found that a lot of species have added species to have a second or a third crumosome , added in a second thousand new traits in a second thousand tracks in a second thousand tracks in a second , or a few of the chromosome , and we found that a second to a chromosome , and we found out that species .
So , who think about evolution as a gene and once it 's modified not much much much of the biology .
They 're going to be called " restriping " restription , which enjoyed to be digerate .
The chromosome that was in the cells , it 's not one .
The mosoma cell phone chromosome that we have inserito---shaped .
It 's expressed , and it recognized the other as summer material , it 's got out , and we 're all all right away , and we got all the time with the cells and the new chromosome .
It became blue because of the gene we 've inserved .
And in a short leververse of time , all the characteristic of a species went through a new species , based on the new software that we 've inserted in a new species , based on the new software that we 've inserted in the cells .
All the protected protected , the members have changed , and when we read the genetic code , exactly what we 've transferred to .
Now , this might seem altering alchemy genetic software , we can change DNA to change things in a funfundamental way .
Now , I 've already explained that it 's not about genesis -- but to progress from three million years and a half a half million evolution , and I said that maybe we 're going to create a new version of Cambrian explosion where we 're going to create new species on this digital .
Why do that ?
I think it 's obvious to our needs .
We 're going to move from six billion and a half billion people in the next 40 years .
Right to give you an example : I was born in 1946 .
Now there are three people on the planet for each existence in 1946 , there will be four .
We 're having problems now to find food , fresh water and clean , medical and breaks for six and a half billion and a half billion people .
It will be even more than that for nine billion .
We 're using more than five billion carbon carbon , more than 30 billion baries of olizes .
That means a hundred million baris per day .
When we try to find biological processes , or any kind of process to recover them , it will be a huge challenge .
We have to keep all of CO2 emission of all the emission of CO2 to these materials that 's going on in the atmosphere .
At day , because of the scientific discoveries in all over the world , we have a database with about 20 million genes , and I like to think that are the design components .
The electronics can only only dozen about some of these things out .
Our limitations are just the data that is actually the reality and our imagination .
Now we have techniques , because of these quick methods of synthetization , in degrees to create what we call fight genomics .
We 're able to build a big robot that can produce a million chromosomes per day .
Think of processing these 20 million different genes of different genes or to get to get the processes to produce eight or drugs , new vaccines , we can change , thank you very small team , now that 's going to create more biology molecular biology now that over the last 20 years of science .
And it 's just a standard selection .
We can choose for survival , chemical production or fuel , or fuel production , or fueless production .
This is a few instantly of some software programmed that we 're working to be able to sit and design species to sit into the computer .
Well , we don 't necessarily know how it will be .
We know exactly how their genetic code .
Now we 're focusing on the fourth of the quarter generation .
You saw you that that extract ethanol was a bad experiment ,
We have a second and third generation that are going to be used to to date enough to sugar wild sugar , like the eight-value or different kinds of butants .
But the only way that biology can have a big impact without increasing more than the cost of food and limitate the cost of food and limitate the ability to transform CO2 in matter before , so we 're working on design cells that can reach to make the discover , and we can think of that , and we think we can have the first carbon , in about 18 months .
The solar solar light with CO2 is a metodomests in our discoveries all over the world , we found different metods .
This is a organism we described in 1996 .
It 's about 2,500 feet of deep at about 2,500 feet of the water temperature .
They create metane from CO2 to use hydrogen molecular as a source of energy .
We 're trying to figure out if we can ensing CO2 , which can easily be transported through , to make that CO2 in carburting , to drive this process .
So , short , we think we could be able to increase what the basic question of " which is " Noi , greatest , " which is " Noi , greatest -- we have the goal to repeat the chemical industry .
Exactly . If you can 't do it from TED , where can you ?
It would become a main fundamental source of energy .
And also , we 're working for using the same metods to create vaccines .
You saw this year with flu , we 're always forth to a year and with a dollar , when it 's about to find the right .
I think what you can change by building vaccines in tinkable vaccines .
So , that 's how the future could start looking at , now , the tree of evolution , accelerating evolution with synthetic bacterial bacterial cells , arches , and finally cells .
We 're so much from the improve people .
Our purpose is to do a long long enough to try to live long enough to try to do it . Thank you very much .
First of all I 'll show you , the fastest possible , some fundamental work , the new technology that we brought to Microsoft the pursuit almost a year ago . This is Seadragon .
It 's a environment that you can interact with a huge amount of visual data with a huge amount of visual data .
Here we 're seeing a lot of gigabyte digital photos with a kind of zoom , and it 's going to a very very clear , and for a leavoric fast-panoramic , avoramic , and we 're going to see the pictures like we want .
And not matter how much much much much of the information we see , how big these things are great data , or the images .
Most are common photographs , but this for example is a scanning wild from the Library of Congress , and it reenter in the gamel of 300 megapiel .
It doesn 't make any difference because the only thing that 's the only thing that 's prestacing the number of pixel on your screen in your screen at any time . It 's also a very flexible architecture .
This is a book , for example , of data not images .
This is the Casa desolate of Dickens . Every colonna represents a chapter .
And to show you that it 's just about it , and not images , we can do something like that , to actually see that it 's a real real representation of the text , not a picture .
It could be a little bit a way of reading an electronic book .
I don 't know it .
This is a more realistic example . It 's a number of the Loooden .
Every picture is the beginning of a section .
And it really gives you the pleasure and the beautiful experience of reading version of a magazine or a quote , which is for a lot of a quote , which is for nature molteplant .
We also did something with the angle of this particular number of the Ladian .
We created a higher advertis-solution-solution-result of what you use in a normal publishing . And we put you in the extra content .
If you want to see the characteristic of this automobile , you can see here .
Or other models , or even the specific techniques .
And this really shows some of these ideas to eliminate the limits of space on the screen .
I hope that that means to put up to a few pop-up and other porcheries , you don 't have to be necessarily .
Of course , the map is one of the most obvious applications for this kind of technology .
And I don 't want to lose time , if we don 't say we have contribute to give them in this field .
These are all the streets in the U.S. geospace-spacecraft picture .
So let 's move to something else .
This is actually now the way to the web ; you can go to see it .
It 's a project called Photosynthy , which combine two different technologies .
One is Seadragon and the other is a visual research in the computer computer that was made by Noah Snavely , a student of Washington 's 's a student of Steve Seitz 's Seitz 's UW Seitz 's Microsoft Rick . It 's a cool collaboration .
And it 's from the Web , managon by Seadragon .
You can see that when we do this kind of screen , where we can spend from a picture to another and have this kind of experience , multiply .
But the space collocation of the pictures here has actually meaning .
The algorithms of visualization that 's computer have recorded these pictures together , so that they 're going to corresponding them to the real places that I think about -- all of you 're going to be taken . And so on the top of the Roccies -- have been screamic , and these things have been taken . Here you see the elements of a de-show , and these things have been plugged at the panoric show , and these things have been playing with panoric , and these things have been plenty .
I don 't know if I have time to show you some other environment .
There are some more space .
I want to spend directly to one of the original data from Noah-- and this comes from a previous prototype of Photosyntheses that we 've done last summer last summer -- to show you what the early early earlier -- to show you what the key is really the key to the key to the right right now now , to show you what we put in the website .
We had to worry about legal aspects and so on .
This is a re-building of Notototre Dame pictures of Nototototes in Flickr . Basta digites Notter Dame , and you get pictures of the magic campus , other campus and so on . You have a picture that 's discovered to this picture that the represents is discovered to this model .
So they 're all images from Flickr and they 've been all linked to spatial level in this way .
And it 's possible to navigate this very simple way .
You know , I never thought to end up to work for Microsoft .
It 's very gratifying , you get this kind of acacovering here .
I think you can see that it 's a lot of different kinds of photoches : from those of the mobile phones to those of the SLR , a meaningful number of meaningful , put together in this environment .
And if I can , I try to find out the most strange .
A lot of them are stuck by faces , etc .
Somewhere , you find a series of photographs -- here 's a series of photographs -- here .
This is a poster of Notre Dame recorded correctly .
We can go from the poster to the physics of this environment .
The essential point is that we can do things with social environment . This is now taking data from the whole memory of collective , from the whole memory of how to appears on the ground , from visual point of view -- and connects to all those data together .
All those pictures become connected together , more than the sum of the parts .
You have a whole ground model of land that emerge .
Think about this as a prolunging of Stephen Lawler on Earth .
It 's something that grows in complexity as you can use it , and the whose people use it , and the whose people use it .
Their pictures are hushed with inseries on other people .
If you get the idea of to contrast all these things like , and say the name of Notre , my photographs of Nototter Do suddenly arrickers to be requires of all those data , and I can use as a little bit of a picture of a re-mote to the space , using the photographing of anybody , and having a red social experience of a cross-mooth , using the screpink of all these data , and you can use it as a cross-out of a clummm-user .
Of course , a consequence of all of that are virtual models of all interesting stuff in the land , it 's interesting , collecting not only to be able to be able to be plane and like synboard and similar pictures and similar pictures and similar satellite images .
Thank you .
Chris Anderson : I got good ? What your software is going to get there to do is is that at some point , in the next years , all of the next years , all of photographs shared by anybody in the entire world will be practically connected with ?
BAA : Yeah . What 's doing is actually discovered .
It 's creating hyperlink , if you want , you want , you to ,
And it 's doing it in the bottom of the pictures .
The thing becomes very interesting if you think about wealth of semantc information semantc .
As you do a research of the web , you digit a sentence and the text on the web page has a lot of information about the picture .
Now , what happens if that picture you 're going to get all of your pictures ?
So the amount of semantics and the amount of wealth and the amount of wealth that comes up is really huge . It 's a classic effect of the network .
CA : Blaise , it 's really amazing . Compedding .
BAA : I thank you very much .
One of the main pleasure , when you traveling and one of the ethnographics is to live in those who has not forgotten the antial traditions , between who has no anti-traditions , you 're going to stick in the windry and we 're going to love it in the levert-plant .
Basti thinking that the chiamani Jaguar vision , and that the Milky Way , or that the monitites are still still meaning , or in Himalayas , the budysts in-like budysts , the buddamly , the idea that the world in which we live not exist in the absolute , and the idea that the world in which we live in the absolute ,
the consequence of a particular set of adaptative choices that our estrates made , well , or a lot of generations ago .
And , of course , we all share of the essential tracks .
We all procreating .
We 're subjects to start .
We have to address the inexorability of dead , so we don 't surprising in if we 're going to --
all of us , we have an art .
What 's the particular one is the particular rhythm of the song of the dance of every culture .
It doesn 't matter that are the Penan forests of Borneo , or the following Voodoo 's the Curururriers , or the desert of Kenya Sectentrional Sectentrional , Curandararroots , or a cammelt cammed in the Sahara .
He was my journey in the desert a month ago , or a yak , or yak yak the yak of Qomolular , on Everest , the world 's demother .
All of these populations teaches us that there are other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , other ways of moving in the world .
And , if you think , if you think it 's a bad concept that it can give you hope .
In the world 's myries create a ragnote of the world creating a spiritual life and cultural and cultural that will have the planet and it 's important to the well-being of the planet as a biosphere .
And you can think about this cultural ragnostic , like an etnosphere , and you can call the thnosphere , and you can call it the total supply , inspiration , ideas , intuitions , intuitions to be from the imagination from human imagination from the wildness of consciousness .
The etnosphere is the fantastic patriage of humanity .
It 's the symbol of what we can be in and what we can be in how much inquisitive species .
And because biosphere was gravously consumed at at the time , and it 's been very quickly to the thrown and unfortunately much faster .
Nobody who would have 50 percent of all species is about 50 percent of all species was or is on the orders of just because it 's fake , or -- in the highest hypothesis -- in the most absolutely optimistic -- and you don 't even get close to the more optimistic issues of cultural diversity .
The index of that is , of course , the language loss .
When you were born 6,000 languages on this planet .
A language is not only compost by a vocabulary or a series of rules .
A language is the scrap is the human spirit .
It 's the middle of all culture comes into the material world .
Every language is a forest of mind , a backin , a thinking , a backin , a spiritual possibility of spiritual possibility .
And of those 6,000 languages , as we 're in Monterey , at least half the time it 's not even more suit 's not soon in the ears of the children .
They 're not teaching kids , the people who mean , unless we cambits to do , that they 're already dying .
What 's more sad than being available by the silence , to be the last to talk about a language , not having a way to transmit the wisdom of the saving wisdom of the children 's promise ?
This is a little bit of a world of someone in some of the world every two weeks : every two weeks a old , a handle and door with with her to the tomble syllabe language .
And I know someone to say , " Do it 's not better ?
The world wouldn 't be a better place if you talk about all the same language ? " Benissim , then we 're talking to all yoruba . We talk to the dotone-pot place .
Let 's talk about kogue .
You 're going to be at a tract thing that means not to talk about your language .
Today I would like to do a trip through the thnosphere --
a little journey in the etnosphere to give you a by-like , what we 're losing .
A lot of us forget that when I say , " different ways of existing , " I mean , " I mean , " I mean , " I mean , " different ways of existing . "
Let 's take for example , Barasana Barasana , in the Sepeptentrional Amazon , who creates at the myth to come from the sought of waste sacon-sandards of sacone-waste sacking .
It 's a popular people who is not able to distinguish color by green because it 's the time you were identified in the forest , which is depends on the forest , which is depends .
They have a strange language and a matrimonial , say , " Take 's " " " " " You have to marry a different person that is a different language .
All of that has radical in the past mitological , though the particular particular , is that in these families and extended up with with households that are in and seven language because of marriages of none of practice .
They 're going to listen and then they start talking .
Let 's take one of the most interesting tribe with which I lived , the Waorani of Ecuador north , an incredible popular people who had the first contacts in 1958 .
In 1957 missionaries have been trying to make a factor .
They did down to photographs them in the upon the top of photographs that they found them in their popular forest , and foresting that this popular forests had never seen anything bi-size .
They collected the land , they went to the research , they went to the research of a shape or a figuring and , not finding anything , they would have been on the hell , and they killed five missionaries with the lance .
But Waorani not to kill the strict .
They were killed with them .
Fifth of mortality was caused by their own .
We 're going to eight generations , and we found two natural cases , and when we had two natural death and when we had been sent to know , they had a lot of them was invectured so he killed it . And then they killed it .
The crosses were able to recognize the animal from 40 steps and recognize the species .
In the early ' 80s , I had been assigned a very interesting task when my professor of Harvard , if I wanted to go to Harvard to Haiti to enjoy the basic effects of Duvalier and Tonton Macoutes and Tonton Macoutes and impossessing with my zombies .
And to give a sense of the myracolost , I should have to understand the Vodoun culture , and that Vodoo not is magic .
It 's pretty much about a complex metaphical vision of the world .
Very interesting .
If I ask you to say to me the greatest religions of the world , what do you ?
Cristianesimum , Islam , Buddismo , Ebraism , etc .
A continent is always left out , thinking that the sub-Saharan Africa has no religious feeding . And you 're the Vodoo is not the other than the distilled of these religious concepts in the tragic tragic ,
What makes the interesting voodoo is the intense race between life and death .
So , you know , they 're going to hide the spirits .
The spirits can invoced by the Great Acqua , they resident on the dance of the dance and they replace temporarily to the soul of the vivivivivivivivivivivivivision , it becomes the following .
So , for that vooyists , you know , " You white , you go to talk about God .
We give them in the temple and force God . "
And from the moment you 're rid , is the spirit that you driven you , how do you get to hurt ?
So you have these incredible events : follow voodoo in the trance of trance that touches are impuntizzons that are impuntizes a demonstration , rather strong the power of mind when it 's catalyzed in a state of extreme , exciting .
In all the popular of the popular of the Sierra Nevada 's 's Kogi of Sierra Nevada 's Santa Marta , in the Santa Marta , in the Sectentrional Sectentrional .
It was scending of the ancient civilization that once they lived on on the charaibic plants of the Colbia , the popular massive , the popular massive massive massive , which is rating on the vulcanic massive massive maxiety .
In a continent macked in a continent , this people never had been conquisted by the Spanish .
But they 're also governed by a clero , but their formation is so extraordinary .
The young people following out of the families are four years , and they live in a world of buy buy and shapes in a world of buy buy and shadow in the bottom of ice for 18 years .
Two dought nine years of proposition to reproduce the nine months of management that transmanagement is going to metaphically in the mother , they 're meaphically in the uteral Grande .
And so , for all of time , they 're acculturate values of their society , that predicts their prayers are prayers to keep the concerned about the equilibrium -- or to say the balance balance balance .
At term of this incredible initiation , they 're suddenly taken out and for the first time in 18 years , they see a alba . And in that actioning of the first butter , when the sun is the first butter , when the sun is the wiss of beautiful landscapes , all that the time is required in the construction it in theory . The prete a step back and it 's saying ,
" Wisto do that ? I said ,
It 's amazing . Now it 's now to you protect it . "
They 're called the major brothers and say that we , brothers , are the wild , we are the wild in the world .
This level of intuition is extremely important .
When we think about the Ingene and the environment and the old history of Rousseau and the old history of wilvacuum , which is a razy concept in his simplicity , which is a razoreau and we give these people .
The popular popular is not feeling or feeling or not as feeling .
There 's no space for these things in Asmall-malaric palalat or in the Tibet , but because of the time and back , they created a mystics of Earth 's 's not about concept of the Earth 's not about concept of the neighborhood of it 's not about concept of the Earth can live only only because it 's infused by the human consciousness .
What does it mean ?
Vuol to say , a kid of Ande who is growing his deep-up , which is a spiririt of Apu that will be a very different human being human being deeply different , and it will have a different human being a very different human being with the mountain , which is going to be a very different rock of the Montana that 's growing mountain , which is a mountain mass of rocks to be taken .
Which is the dimady of a spirit or a mineral cutting .
What 's interesting is the metaphor that 's just about the metaphor , which is the natural world .
I grew up in the forests of the Britannica credating that forests to be cut .
And that made me a human being different from my friends Kwakiutter who believe that the forests are the Hamkuk dise and the bats of the paradise and the batch of the paradise and the donibal of the world , we 're going to affect in the Hamatsa began with the Hamatsa .
If you start to look at that these cultures can create different reality , I could start understanding some of them to understand some of them feelal .
I took this picture to open up in the nordoctor in the nordocctors .
Mayahuasks , you 've heard of the ayahuasks , the most powerful substance of the month repertoire .
What makes it fascinating the ayahuasks is not the potential to the sudden potential of the substance , but his elaboration . It 's started by two elements .
From one on the side , this lian launch of beta-carboline , harmful and harmful , harmful and harmful , slightly hillness .
Take the only plants , it has a blumelt , and it 's a little bit of consciousness , but it 's mychoice with the leaves of a coffee family called Psychotridis called Psychotridis .
This plant is a lot of triptamine , very similar to serotonin , dimethyltryptamine-5 , methoxtamine .
If you ever see Yanomami to pull on for the nose substance that they do with a different species of species , he 's contained methothoxptamine .
Tiring that polust on the nose is a little bit like being disparated by a writing carypink yboes and landed on a sea of electricity . [ Risoning not creates a distorsion of reality ; it 's creates the dissolution of reality .
I was very often with my professor , Richard Evan Shultes , the man who has been watened the psychc , with his discovery in the 1930s in Mexico .
I think you can 't be laughed to class these triptamine as as you 're going to hit because if you 're not going to tell anybody to be hallucinated .
It 's possible to be able to be at all of the chemicals that denied the MAO .
Now , the beautiful carboline : Is that they find in this lian lian lian injititors of MAO , the same type to potentions to be able to potential the triptamine : in a flour of 80,000 species , like these popular , like these popular , they do these popular people , they do these popular find two deogically not , but that if you combinated in this way , create a biochemical version of the parts ?
We use the great euthror of the proof and the mistake , which can reveal infruit .
But if we ask to the Indians , they 'll say , " The plants are talking about . "
What does it mean ?
This tribes , the Cofan , has 17 of ayahuasks , which are narely in the forest , and that you 're going to be in the forest .
If they ask them how they 're going to stbiliphike their tassonomes will say , " I thought , " I said , " I said , " No . "
The solution is : You take the 17 variety variety of a full of moon and each other will be doctor with a different tone .
With this doesn 't be graduate to Harvard , but it 's much more interesting to count the stamong .
Now , [ applaushes the problem is that even the ones of us who have to heart popular people are in the paintings are pepittoresks , but somehow reducts to the margins of the real world , and it pass .
In fact , the 11th century , in 300 years , it 's not going to be remembered for his wars or innovations , but rather as the one was where we stopped and abbraced actively or accepted by passively , or accepted the destruction of the planet . Now the problem is not change .
All cultures through the centuries have been involved in a dance for new possibility of life .
And the problem is not technology .
The Indians Sioux not to be Sioux when they put in the arc and they 're received as a part of the Americans don 't have stopopped to be Americans when they put in the horse and heat .
It 's not the change or technology that 's threatening the integrity of the thnosphere . It 's the power .
The last fly flight .
And if you give a look at the world , you 'll find that these are not destinated cultures .
They 're living creatures and dynamic forces out of the existence of identifiable forces that go beyonic their ability to adaptation .
I 'm going to be disboscing in the Penan --
a popular nobble , in the south--the-Asian popular , a popular people who lived lived in the forest to a generation ago , and now reduced to the servitoom , where you can see the river of the river , where you can see the river the river that seems to take away . Borneo Mar Cinese , where the Nurt Sydional Meridiond , where the Japanese Meridionte , where you can can be the horizon .
With the forest stage with the forest .
Or , in the case of Yanomami , are the disease that have come with the gold .
If we move on on the mountains of Tibet , where I 'm doing a lot of research , you see the hard flight of politics .
As you know , the physical extinction of a popular popular , is universal level , but the ethnocide , but the dy-instruction of a popular life , not only is convicted , not only is convicted , because it 's a part of the development of the developing of the development of development .
And you can 't understand the suffering of Tibet until you 're in the beginning .
I 've been the 6,000 miles from Chengdu in Chengdu through Tibet sweat , and it 's coming to Lhasa with a young colleague , but only came to Lhasa young connection , but only came to Lhasa . I realized what 's behind the statistics we hear .
6,000 sacres reducts in your pounds and cenjoyed .
1.2 million people killed by the military of the Cultural Rivolution .
The dad of this guy was abcriticized at Panchen Lama .
That means that it was killed in the Chinese invasion .
Her was falled with Sua Santity during the diaspora that has taken popular in Nepal .
Sua mother was imprigioned and his colpe was rich .
It was brought to the age of two years from hidden , he would have been born because he wouldn 't have to live without him .
The sister , who did the same , it was mit in reeducation .
A day he inavailable day a coffign fascinating Mao and , for this transgression , was mit to be put in seven years .
The Tibet 's pain of Tibet can be inoverwhelmed , but the recenter of the people 's popular .
And finally , it reduce reduce to a choice .
Let 's take live in the monothic world of monothic or want to accover the world policy or we want to account the world policy ?
Margaret Mead , before he died that his bigger was that he said that his bigger was that , in our going to be able to this love view of the world , not only we 're going to see the whole range of human imagination reduced to a limited day that we 're going to see a slead limited to a sleep , but one day we 're going to get away from a sleep to a slead to a sleep ,
And it 's umillion to remember that our species is about 60,000 years .
The Neolitica , who gave us the Neolitica , who made us underwater agriculture , which has done us subject , it 's replacing the poetry of the skip with the proxy of the clero , creating gerarchie , and we 're talking about 10,000 years ago .
The modern industrialized world has 300 years .
That 's not not suggestion that we have the answers to all the challenge that we 're going to have the answers to come to the .
When you to these myries of culture of the world is asked what it means to be human , they resident with 10,000 different voices .
And it 's in these answers that we all recovers the possibility of being what we are : a consciousness , it has to make all the popular . And there 's great moments of optimism . And there 's great moments of optitimism .
I took this picture on the northern extremity of Baffin , when I went to the whales with Inuit , and this man , Olayas , Olayas , he told me the wonderful story of his grandfather .
The English government was not always wentile with the Inuit 's popular , and in the ' 50s to stbilifetes our , we have to remains them in colonies .
The grandfather of this man refuted to go .
The family , I teming her life , I 'll take it all the time , and all of his attitudes .
You have to know that Inuit doesn 't temit the cold , they 're going to do it .
The packs were slitters in the origin were made of pain .
The grandfather of this man didn 't have to intimiddnight or from the library , or from the library that was suffering .
It 's sgattaitholyzed , it 's calculated the pantalons in focus and defecated in your hand . When I did it made a lama . When I did you made a lama .
He 's spruped on the dog of this cop of caccess , and when it became solid , he killed a dog .
It 's taken the dog and created a brillier , with the cassy cases created a sleep , he imbrillied another dog and it 's disappeared on the bags , he hake up on the bags , he 's caccess to the hake .
Let 's take away from horse with nothing ? [ Risated ] . And this , in different ways , [ Applausi is the symbol of resilience people 's popular .
In the open-year-old English government has reached to the total control of a total territory of a larger territory of California and Texas I put together .
It 's their new patria . It 's called Nunut .
It 's a territory . They 're going to be all the minerarial resources .
One of the splendid of a natione-state can recognize with his popular .
And , to finish , I think it 's pretty obvious at least to those remote places of us was in these remote arts of the planet , realization that they 're not deal .
For someone is home .
They representing the human imagination that results rising at the time . And for all of us , the dreams of these kids , like dreams of our children , become part of the geography of hope .
First , we 're in National Geographic we are convince that politicians will never come to anything .
We believe that the polemies --
[ Applausi is not persuasive , but we believe that the stories can change the world , and maybe we 're the best institution to tell the stories of the world . Every month rying 35 million visits own website .
156 countries transmit our television channel .
Our rivivivivivivivivivivivivivivivivivivivivivivivivivivivivivivivivivivivivivivivivivivivivivivivivivivivivivivivivivivivivivivivivivivivivivivivivivivivivivivivivivivivists are thurious .
Our work is to travel in the thnosphere to bring our audience in places of marvels of cultural marvels that they 're going to be able to , and , hopefully abbracing for time , the central reveal reveal of the world , and we have to find a life 's pluralist and we have to find a life in a pluralist and multicultural style , and we have to find a life style and multicultural revehicle
where the wisdom of all the populations can contributing to our collective well-being collective .
Thank you .
I 'm going to talk about some things I wrote in this book that I hope I 'm going to recall some of the connections , in case not known them .
I want to start with what I call " the official dogma official dogen .
Do you know what ?
The official dogma of all the Western industrial society , the dogma official dogload , " If we want to massive our citizens . " " The way to do it is massive to do it is massive to be massive . "
The reason is , from one side , in fact that freedom is in itself a value , is predictable , is essential for human beings .
On the other one of us can act for all of us can act for all that that is , we can act for all that that massive to do everything that massive is , not no one that you 're going to be , without no one that decides to name our .
The way to massive massive freedom is massive to massive .
More choices people have , more libuts , and more is their wealthight , more is their weless .
This , is so deeply round in the society that nobody would dreams to put it in doubt .
And it 's also deeply rooted in our lives .
I 'm going to show you some examples of what has made of progress as possible .
This is my supermarket . It 's not particularly big .
I 'm going to be a simple note on on the saved .
In my supermarket , there are 175 conditions , without contate 10 of extract oil and 12 covers of olive olive , which you can buy for a huge number of conditions in the incbreakous circumstance that nobody of one of the 175 proning is to your degrees .
That 's what the supermarket .
Then you go to the electronic store to buy a stereo : CD , radio , radio , piaright , practice , radio , piaright , printice .
And in this single core store , there 's a big number of audio components .
We can do six million and a half million different fighting with the components that there are in one store .
You have to admit that there 's a lot of choice .
Other camps : the world of communications .
Once , when I was a child , you could get all the wish telephone services , at the package that they were fornites by Mom Bell .
It was going to get the phone , it didn 't buy it .
A consequence of that , the next one was that the telephone never would break .
These days are gone .
So now we have a variety variety of telephones , especially between mobile phones .
That 's the mobile phone .
My favorite is that in the middle , MP3 , cut out of nose , and forces for the brick me to crack crack hit .
If you don 't have seen it in the house , you 're well certain that will be going to get .
And what happens to the end is that people go into the wirds and make this question . And you know , you know what the answer is , " No . "
It 's not possible to buy a mobile phone that doesn 't do too much .
So , in other things of life that are much more important than the aquists , you know , the same blocks .
Axistence : no more in the United States that you go from the doctor and the doctor you say what to do .
Instead , you go to the doctor , and the doctor says , " OK , we could do A , or B , " A has these benefits of these well-hand-up and these answers , " By you have these benefits . What do you want to do ? "
You say , " Dotore , what should I do ? "
And the doctor says , " A has these benefits and these risks , and it has these benefits . "
What do you want to do ? "
And you 're going to say , " Dotore if she was me , what would it do ? "
And the doctor : " But I 'm not . "
The result of the result , we call it " autonomous , expression that makes it a beautiful thing .
But it 's actually not a move to the weight and the responsibility to make someone who knows something , which is the doctor , to someone else knows not -- and so much of course , it 's not not -- and so in fact , it 's not not about -- and so in the ideal condition to take the patient decisions .
There 's a huge marketing of drug products , direct to people like me and you , that if you think about it doesn 't have any sense , because you can 't buy them .
But if we can 't buy them , why do you have to be public ?
The answer is that they want to domesting the doctor to ask them to change the recicipe .
Something that 's like our identity is our identity is a question of choice , as you see in this dreams . " We 're not going to force the children . " We 're not going to force their own time at the right time , " not we need to invent it . " We need to invent . "
And we can reinvent how many times us .
That means that every morning , at the risk , you have to decide that kind of person want to be .
It was to the family and marriage , a time the common perspective , ununits for anyone , was that it was that it was ever ever ever possible , it was that there was the most soon as possible .
The only real choice was with who , not when you don 't even when you do it .
Over day , it 's really played .
I 'm very smart students , and I do 20 percent at least than a time .
And it 's not because they 're not brilligent , not because they 're less diligent .
but why am I impensiered , I mean , " Would I have to marry or not ? Do you have to do it now ? "
" Do I have to marrise of the back or career ? "
They 're interrogatives .
And they 're trying to answer these questions , even if this implessing not to do the homework that I 'm going to get a nice of my examples .
And they really have to do it . I 'm important .
Now , the work : we 're lucky , like the underneath , because technology allows us to work every minute , every day , every day , every day , every day , on the planet , except that Hotel Randh .
I 'm talking , there 's a angle , and I won 't tell anybody where , where WiFi works .
I don 't tell you , because I want to use it .
What does this mean , this incredible freedom of choice that we have about work ? It 's we have to keep on , continuously , if we have to work or not .
We can go to see our son playing with the mobile phone , with the mobile phone in the other , Blackberry in the other , and the theme , typically , on the ginkle .
And even if they 're all spent , every minute that we see our son ruining the partners , we 're also asking this called ? "
" Do I have to answer this email ? I have to abbozzy this letter ? "
And even when the answer is " no , " all this makes the experience of your son 's game very different from what it would be in other conditions .
So , anywhere we look at , small and large , materials and large , materials and styles of life , life is a question of choice .
Once the world was this : Ovreal , there were some possibility , but not all about it was about choice .
The world of today looks like this : The dilemma is , " II a positive thing , or negative ? "
The answer is Surdry .
The positive lated ones . We know , so I 'm going to talk about negative those .
All of this choice is two negative effects on people .
The first , paraladopically , is that it produced paralysis that it produced .
With a lot of options between which options to be , it becomes very difficult to do it .
I give you an example of a meaningful study on flying on voluntedness .
A my colleague has had access to the Vaney , the gigantic society , in about a million degree of pension , with about a million clients in 2000 different companies .
What she found is that for every 10 solutions that are offerved in more , the percentage of adesion , two percent of them are .
With 50 funds , there 's 10 percent in less than adhhesions than only five . Because ?
Because with 50 sources between the source of which is maledtly difficult to decide , and choice is sent to stick .
And I ask tomorrow , and I still ask , tomorrow , and of course , and of course , the goal never comes .
You know , it doesn 't mean that that these work from old who are going to major food for the dogs because they 're not going to have enough money , it also lose the decision is so hostical that allose the funds of the work .
They 're not participating , they 're losing until five thousand dollars a year from the work , which would be wen to be greatly disposed to be .
So , the paralysis is a consequence of having too too many choices .
And I think it makes the world like this .
" And finally , for the keternity : ketchup , or maion , or maion ? "
You 'd just take the right decision , if it 's for ethernity , right ?
You don 't want to choose the wrong wrong , and you 're neeat the wrong condition .
So this is the first effect . The second is that we even had to avoid paralysis and doing a choice , at the end we 're less subject as we would be with less options to be done with less options between how we 're going to be with less options to be in .
And that 's a lot of reasons .
One of these is that with many conditions between which you choice , if you buy one and it 's not easy to imagine that you could have a different choice that you could have a different choice that would be better . And what happens is , it 's the alternative to imagine , and the repintuition is that alternative to be , and the repeasing fer the soddisfer , and the repink the soddisfer ,
even when it was a very good decision .
More choices are more than you 're doing , it 's more disliercies than any details that 's insodation-insoddislies .
Also , there 's what economists call expensive .
Dan Gilbert has close very well stamattine as the value that we do to things depends on what we 're talking about .
And so , when there 's a lot of options , it 's easy to represent the account characteristic papers and be less lighting and be less lighted than the option that you 're choice .
So , I 've got a lot of the ones that are not New York .
But that 's what you would probably think .
There 's this copy in Hamptons .
A lussian place place .
Samints . Otma day day . It 's all for them .
Not nothing . But what he thinks is , " Well , the objection , it 's Agosian . "
" Everybody neighbors Manhattan is away . "
" I could talk about it right at home . "
And it goes two weeks , I 've been losing -- every day -- every day -- the possibility of parking where it wants .
The opportunity decrecrease of the datisfaction for what we have , even when the choice was excellent .
And the other things we have to look at , more the most of the accountable .
Here 's another example .
This is a lot of things .
It 's about living the moment , and maybe to live slowly .
But the most important point is that anything you choice , you 're not going to do other .
The things that we don 't choose to make a lot of attractive , they can make less attract what we do .
Third point : spiral growing of expectations .
I tried it on my skin buying a new couple of jeans .
I 'm almost always jeans .
Once jeans were just a guy , buy them and besty were born , they were discomodissies , only after having a lifted of a life and washing a lot of times , they started going well .
So , I went to buy a couple new when the old people went , and I said , " I need a couple of jeans , this is my cut . "
The commit said , " Do you want slim , explains , relaxed , relationship axed ? "
Do you want to do it with the cernian or bottons ? " Stonewashed , " or " acidwashed ? "
" Do you want to strate ? "
" Sotto them , you want to leave it ? Bbla bla -- " -- " Continured to elenjoy it .
I was skept , and after a little bit , I could say , " I want the guy to say , " I want the guy that was the only guy , " He had no idea what , so for a time I tried to all jeans , and then I was out of the jeans that I had .
It was the massive . I had the best .
But I felt out worse .
Why ? I wrote a whole book to understand it .
The reason I was worse is that with all that choice is that with all of my waitative , the jeans had to be perfect .
I was at the beginning I had expectations . I didn 't expect to do anything about that , but when it was 100 different , accidents , at least a kind of had to be perfect .
What I was buy , but not perfect .
After I had paragoned that I was going to try to disdisappeared to expectations .
The added added options in life doesn 't do that increasing the expectations that these are respected to the excellence of options .
And this will be less satisfaction , even when the result of the result of it .
Nobody in marketing if you realize .
Because if they knew it , you don 't know what I 'm talking about .
The truth looks more about this .
" He was better when it was worse . " The reason he was better when it was worse was worse is that when it was worse was even possible to meet of surprised .
Over the world we live in -- the world we live -- opulent , industrialized , with the expectancy of feeding -- the massive that we can hope is that things are at the altitude .
You never ever surprised as much pleasant because your expectations , my expectations , I 'm ingigantic .
The secret of happiness -- what you 're here -- is , " Basxiful " Yes , you want . "
I mean , I mean , I 'm really , very , very , very , very , married and my wife is really amazing .
I couldn 't do it , I didn 't have accounted me .
But it 's not always a bad thing is a bad thing .
Finally , a consequence of buy jeans , when there 's only that jeans , is that when you 're not sationally sessing , and you 're going to ask you " Why ? "
" Who 's responsible ? " , the answer is clear .
The world is responsible . What could I do with ?
When they 're hundreds of kinds of jeans , and you buy a insoddisfacing , and you ask you who is the responsible , it 's just clear that the responsible you .
You could do better .
With hundreds of variety variety variety variety , not have been taken for insuccess .
So when people take decisions , even if the result is to solve , they feel like to satio , they feel like they 're sationally diseperforming their own .
In the last few years , the depression is exploded in the industry world .
I think that a significant factor -- not the only one , but important -- of this wave of depression is that people have been a lot of delusion is that people have too high .
And when they have to explain this situation , they think that the colpe is they think that they 're going to .
So the final result is that we 're better , objectively , but we feel worse .
So let me remember it .
This is the official dogma , what we all take for good and it 's completely fake . It 's not true .
There 's no doubt that a little bit of choice is better than I don 't have any derived , but it doesn 't really hit , it 's better than a little bit .
There 's a critical value , I don 't know what it 's .
But I 'm sure we 've been pretty sure we 've been through a piece of the level that choices better our life .
Now , from political point of view -- I 've almost finished -- from political point of view , the cracy is the following .
What it allows all this to industrial society is the material wealthy .
There are many places in the world , and you know , you know , where the problem is not that they have to find out .
The problem is that they have too too few .
So the factory I 'm talking about is a mal-being excuse of modern , wealthight of modern society .
And what it does depress and climbs this : Steve Levitt Levitt has talked about how to the expensive and pursuit , for baby . It 's a spring of money .
I mean these choices , complicated and available , it 's not that they 're just inuseful .
I 'm very deleterie .
They 're worse .
If a little bit of what in our society is allowed to be reversed in those where people have too few possibility , it would not only be their life to improve but our our our life .
That 's what economists call a paretian improve improve better .
A redistribution of the income redistribution to all -- not only to poor -- because of this choice in excess that it comes .
And so I said , " Fille , you can become everything you want to " --
You , you 're thinking , " What does that believe ? "
" It 's obvious that you can 't get anything in a glass of glass . "
" A castrated , a limited vision of the world --
and I 'm going to interpret that , at the beginning .
But then , I think , instead , I realized that that the fish the long way .
Because the reality of the facts is that if you mand to get the boundaries , so that " you can 't get the freedom .
If you break the boundaries so that all of diminuminured .
You 're going to get the paralysis , and you 're going to reduck .
Everybody needs a sphere .
This is almost certainly too close , maybe even for the fish , and it 's certainly for us .
But the absence of some symboboard is a recipe for infeless and , for a suddenly .
Thank you very heart .
