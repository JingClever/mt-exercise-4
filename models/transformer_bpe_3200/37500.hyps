Last year I showed these these devices to show that the Arctic ice , for almost three million years , which for almost three million years , had the size of the 48 continental size of 48 percent .
But this is a gravity of the problem because it doesn 't show the sporof the ice of the ice .
The arctic glacial is , in a way , the clear heart of the global climate system .
You expanies of winter and you take away away .
The next next positive is going to be a quick carrelated to the advocate over the last 25 years .
Space , the pyaces are signed in red .
You see , they expand until blue wall .
That 's the ice in winter , which is retreated .
You can see that the so-called the stage of five years or more , is like blood , which is like blood , which is like blood , which is like blood .
In 25 years , it 's past .
This is a problem because the warming interest the ground is interested in the terrain the Arctic ocean where there are huge amounts of carbon congelated , and they 're transformed into the microbes .
I think about the totality of the pollution of global warming , that could doubled , super-scale . That could doubled , super-return .
In some little deep laghi , in Alaska meter , is already rebolling by water .
The professor Katey Walter of Alaska University of Alaska was a team in the winter team , the winter ,
Video : Wow ! Al Gore : You 're good . The question is if we 're going to be .
A reason that this is that the termal exchange , the Groenland from the north .
This is a river river in the glacial regime .
The layers had never reached a similar levels .
This is the Kangerlussuaq , in the southwest of the Groenland .
If you want to know how the sea level for the sea level for the path of the pink , here is where the sea .
These currents are up rapidly .
Antarctica , the largest Antarctica block of the planet .
The last month , scientists have dichieve that the balance of ice is in the negative , and the Western Antarctica , which is particularly rapid Western underwater , is particularly rapid to the chieve .
It 's six meters of the water water , like Groenland .
Sulil Himalayas , the third largest block of ice , you see new laghi , which few years ago , a few years ago , and a few years ago , you see , which few years ago , you see the laghi 's 's new lacked .
40 percent of the world population is half the world 's population is half of the water from that melting .
Sulle Ande : this glacier is the source of this city .
The landed is increased .
But when you decrease , the same happens to the water in the potable water .
In California the snow on Sierra Nevada is 40 percent decreased .
Girl kens are in crisis .
Pherase , as you 've read , you were good .
The growing safity in the world leads to an inceness of the inceness .
The environmental disaster disaster is increasing a rhythm outside of the normal and without precedented .
Four times more numerous over the last 30 years than the previous previous 75 .
This is a whole unsustainable way .
If you look at the context of the historical context , they can see the historical consequences .
In the last five years we added 70 million tons of CO2 every 24 hours -- 25 million tons of the ocean every day .
Look at the Eastern Pacific , the American American , towth towth , and on both parts of Indian subcontinent , where there 's a rootal rooth of the ocean oxygen in the ocean .
The major causes global warming , together with deforestation , which is 20 percent of them , is the fossil fuel use .
The oil is a problem , and the carbon is even worse .
The United States is one of the two more emissions , together with China .
And he was proposing to build a lot of other central coal .
But we 're seeing a direction of the way .
These are the anullated projects over the last few years and some green alternative projects .
Anyway , there 's a political fight in our country .
The carbon industry and the oil industry have spent 250 million dollars in the last year to promote carbon industries , which is a oxymate .
And I would remember this picture me ,
So , I live , Tennessee , where I live , there was 3.8 billion ligallons of carbon lifeters . .
Maybe you 've seen on news .
This is the second largest flow of last large in America .
It 's happened around Christmas .
The Real Real publicity of one of the carbon industry .
Video : I 'm sure , I 'm a carbon , it 's a kind of allegro and happy .
It 's abundant here in America , and it 's growing our economy .
From Frosty carbon is and cleaner .
It 's good price , adorable , and the work is keep the stypend .
Al Gore : At here 's a lot of West Virginia .
The biggest mineral society on the mountain society is Massey Coal . This is his administrator .
Video : With Blankenship : Swear Al Gore , Nancy Pelous , Harry Reid -- not know what they 're talking about .
Al Gore : So the Alleance for Clima has launched two campaign .
This is a thing of them , one part .
Video : Acore : ALergy : ALergy , we see climate change , like a serious threat our business .
So , our priority is to invest a large amount of money in a commercial effort to make public and confused the truth of the truth of the truth .
In fact , carbon is not sports .
We think it 's clean -- it 's also a good profume .
So , not pitch for climate change .
Let 's do it to us .
Video : Can : Carbone -- you 've heard a lot of it .
So let 's take a turn into into a horrise to the launch for how carbon .
Straordinary ! The machines are a little noissues , but this is the sound of the clean technology of the clean technology .
The carbon consumers is among the main causes of global warming , but the technology remarkable that you see changes everything .
You look at a look : this is the odiergy of clean technology .
Al Gore : Infine , positive alternative , positive alternational security .
Video : The America is in crisis ; the economy , the national security , climate crisis .
The whenever the links all : our dependence by fossil fuels , like carbon fuel and oil practice .
Now , but there 's a new audace , audace solution to get out .
ReAmerica : 100 percent of clean energy in 10 years .
A plan to put America to work to put America to work , and help us safer global warming .
Finally , a solution that is to solve our problems .
Really , you know , ReAmerica .
Al Gore : This is the last .
Video : Comment : It 's about to report energy .
One of the fastest ways to bring dependence from combustible that killing our planet .
So , I 'm here . Sun , a new energy network .
Novi investment for two : New investment for very well retribes .
Repower America . It 's time to be realists .
Al Gore : A African proverbio African proverbio , you 're going to go fast , and you go to yourself .
If you want to go away , you go together . "
We have to go away , fast .
Thank you very much .
Lap last year at TED , I introduced a LHC .
And I promise to return to hold you to how machine works .
So there I was . And for the ones that they didn 't have , the LHC is the biggest scientific experiment ever they had -- 27 kilometers of circumstances .
His task to rereconstructions that they were at less than a billion , at the beginning of the universe -- until 600 million times a second .
All of that is just ambicious .
This is the car below Ginevra .
We 're going to take these little Big Bang inside the detectors .
This is what I work on . It 's called ATLAS -- is 44 meters and has a diameter diameter diameter diameter diameter .
This is an ATLAS picture in built so you can see .
Ten September 10 sept-year machine for the first time .
And this picture was taken by ATLAS .
It was because of immense fresh to control the saving room .
It 's a picture of the first fascil of particles that had done all the turn of LHC , entering , with a little bit of LHHC , and spread particles into the detector .
In other words , when we see that image 10 settember , we realize that the machine worked , which is a great wictory .
I don 't know if it was this to make us more or this , and I saw that the page was this .
That means we have had a cultural impact beyond to the scientific .
About a week later , there was a problem with the car , and it had to these sleep here -- these sleep sleep .
These flech , 13,000 amping the car works when the car works .
Now , the technicians will look at the cluster and say , " It 's not true . I 'm not true . I 'm too sleep . "
And they can do it because when they 're very co-called superconviction .
So at least 271 degrees , at least 271 degrees on the space between stars , these are a little bit of the space .
In one of the juncles between the magneti magneti magneti in LHC , there was a fect of fabrication .
So the files , they measure it 's slightly , and the 13,000 levels had an electrical resistance .
This was the result .
Now , this is even more impressive if you think that these web fish more than 20 tons , and they 've been moved about 30 inches .
They have damage about 50 magnetic .
We had to take them , what we did .
We 've been inherent and enables .
Now they 're now coming back to their own place underground .
By the end of the LHC is going to be back back to the integral .
We 're going to access it , and we expect to get data or June , and we 're going to continue so our adventure our adventure to find out what the universe is the morning that universe .
Now , of course , these clearly re-accended , these accidents re-debate on the value of science and engineering in front of the engineering of the front .
I think the fact that it 's so hard , the fact that I think the value of things like LHC .
I want to end up with with the words of a English scientist , Humphrey Davy , which , I think , in defense of the unuseful experiments of his blood , his pupille was Michael Faraday , said , " Niest is so much dangerous for progress of human mind as the mind as the report of the mind that the idea of science are definitive , which our triumph-worl-for-to-class of wers who are not conquote . "
Thank you .
I want to start asking you to rethink of when , as children , play with kids , playing with the morning .
As you get to reach and deal with them , take them and get them , and you learn them , learn to think and solve problems and solve problems and manipulating space relationships .
The space reasoning is deeply connected to the way we understand most of the world around us .
So , from the information usulity of our interaction with physical objects , together to my Padies , and my collaborator Jeevan Kalanithi , I started to ask ask , " And if , when we use a computer , but we 're using just a computer , instead of having the only of the multimate . We have the only of the multimate potfire that moving on a desktop , we can deal with both your own ,
and how do it to be to do it ?
The question was so interesting that we decided to do to explore the answer , building Siftable .
In a words , a Siftable computer is a big interactive computer as a biscoscooer .
In a words , a Siftable computer is a big interactive computer as a biscoscooer .
You can move with them , they can see " between them , " and they can hear their movement and they have a screen and a wireless .
But most of course , they 're physical objects like the morning , as the morning , they can actually move to .
Siftable is the example of a new ecosystem tools to manipulate digital information .
And as they become more physicists , conscious , conscious of the movement , of others , and as they become more physicists , conscious conscious of the movement , of how we die them , we can exploring new new and fun interaction .
I 'll start with some simple example .
This Siftable is configured to show video : if you 're in a direction , the video is going to stay on the other side , we 'll get back to .
These interactive racts are awareness .
If I ran them , they 're interested in what they 're around .
If they 're surrounded , and they can act a little bit .
If they 're surrounded , and they can act a little bit .
They also have their movement and inclination .
We then realized that one of the interesting implications of the interaction was we can use common data , for example , to example , " we mention " a color like it was a liquid .
In this case , we have three Siftable configurate as a buck bucks and I can use them to figuring color in the central , where they mix .
and I can use them to fix color in that central , where they mix .
We can do too , we can put a little bit up .
There are also beautiful chance of learning , like language , like language , the mathematics , where people can try things , and see the math results of the immediately .
Now I 'm now ...
This is a Fibonaccount that I do with a program of equations .
Here we have a words that 's half of Scarabeo and Boble .
Pratically , at every turnal turnal you can go to every Siftable , Pratically , to every turnal turnal , at every turnal you get a letter in case of you , and you try to compare with words , and you 're trying to buy words , and you 're trying to buy them .
And then , after about 30 seconds they put up , and you have a new letter set of reading and new chance to try .
Thank you .
So here 's the children came to Media Lab , I 've done so that I tried them and I took a video .
They are very pleased to them .
And one of the interesting things of this kind of application is that you don 't have to give people a lot of education .
You just say , " Compons of words , and they know exactly what to do .
That 's what 's what they try .
This is our younger younger tester header for the younger tester heads there .
It was actually wanted to imple them .
They were only bringing morning for him .
Now , this is a little bit of an interactive cardge-.
We wanted to build a tool for the apprentice of Lui language is Felix .
It can insert new characters in the scene , by lifetime .
It can insert new characters in the scene , by lifetime .
So , that 's doing the sun .
Video : The sun is smiling .
David Merrill : Now she took a tretor in the scene .
Video : The horange .
Bel work ! Yeah !
So , you know , the Siftable and put them up to interact with the characters --
Video : Bau !
-- inventing your story .
Video : Hi !
DM : It 's a story with open , and he can decide him as you 're going to decide .
DM : It 's a story with open , and he can decide him as you 're going to decide .
Video : Filk , throw .
DM : The last example I have time to show you is a device , made of recent , to sample , to sample and execececececture ,
It 's a device , which is a device , to track and execececececraft .
Siftable here , based on the sounds like basic and bacteria .
Every one of these has four different different variations , and you can choose which to use .
You can also put these sound in a sequence to compete with your pleasure .
And you can change it by doing it by doing a strong sound and a sequence .
These are actually able effects that you can control from live , like reverbing and filter .
The attacks to a particular sound and then inclens to enjoy it .
And then there are general effects like time and volume , which is going to reach the entire sequence .
Let 's look how it works .
Video : We 'll start putting a basic in two Siftable sequence , we 're going to start a series , we 're add to the other basic .
Now , I 'm going to put a lapon line .
Video : I add the percussions --
Video : And I 'll put the bacteria on the bacteria , so I can control the live effect .
Video : I can fast the entire sequence by the way or .
Video : I 'll add the bottom of the lower to the lower bass to give more expression .
Video : I can recombine the sequence to the sequence of flight .
So I don 't have to plan it before , but I can improvision , make it longer or .
And now , finally , I can sleep the whole sequence on the left Siftable .
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is to build new mountain machine interfacial interactions as our brain and body .
And today , I had time to show you one of the results of this path , and also some chance we try to bring out of the lab .
The concept I want to transmit is that 's coming this new generation of designing objects to interact with digital media media , which will take information in our world in the way we want .
Thank you very much .
I don 't see the hour of talking to all of you .
I 'm a writer .
You have books is my profession , but it 's more than this , obviously .
It 's also love and the fascination of my life .
And I don 't look like to change .
But , I said , something particular has happened in my life and the career , which brought me to get the whole relationship with this work .
The particular thing is that I recently written this book , this biography called " Mangia , Ama , Ama , " Ama , " Ama , " The thing , diversally , so much of my books , for some reason why came out in the world and became a big , fe-bestseller , interational bestties .
And the result is that everywhere is going to be , people treated me as if I was convicted .
Really -- you know , convicted .
They 're all going to be worried and they say , " Don 't you fear to do better ?
You don 't have fear to continue to write for all life without being able to create a book that can be able to make someone ? "
which can be importantly someone ? "
It 's sauce , you know .
But it could go worse , except I remember that I 'm over 20 years ago , when I started saying to people -- I was a teenager -- I wanted to be a writer .
I went up and I 'd meet the same reaction that was based on .
And people said , " Don 't I could not have succeful ?
You don 't have fear that the umillion of the refur killed ?
You don 't have afraid of doing this waste for all life without anything about it ever comes and die on a heart of the wildlife , with the mouth of the by-lowing wildlife , and I 'm going to die ? "
So , you know .
The answer -- the short answer to all these questions is , " Yeah . "
Yeah , I 'm afraid of all those things .
I 've always had fear .
And I also fear of many other things that people can 't guess .
As the algae and other sweet things .
But , as I would write what I thought and ask me , and I would ask myself , what ?
Is it rational ?
It 's logical that anyone has to wait to be scared by a job that 's born to do .
But what 's so special in the creative and make it nervous about increasing health care in one way that other career .
How my father , for example , he was a chemical engineer and I don 't remember one time in his 40 years of activity where I was asked if he had fear to be engineer ?
There was never -- that block of engineer John , how do that ?
It didn 't work like that , you know ?
Onestly , chemical engineers like group don 't have certainly , in the centuries , gain , earnly gave the reputation of being alcolized .
We have enough meeting . We have enough this reputation , and not just a writers , but you creatives of all kinds of things , we have this reputation of being enormous .
And it 's not about looking at the sad , the sad of the creative magnificments that , only in the 21st century , they die young young and often to them .
And the ones that don 't have been suicide from their dundones .
Norman Mailer , before I die , in the last interview said , " Every little bit of an amazing affermation about the work of your life .
But we don 't hold my own own , because we 've heard these things so long that we 've heard these things so long that in some way we have completely interized and accepted the notion that creativity and suffering are somehow tied and the art , finally , it 's going to be able to always at the end .
And the question I want to take to all here today is : Are you with this idea ?
You know this thing -- because it also looks like , it 's just about a centimeter of distance to me .
I think it 's hate .
And I think it 's dangerous and I don 't want to see perpetuate perpetuate in the next century .
I think it 's better to encourage our big creative minds live .
And I certainly know , in my case -- in my situation -- it would be very dangerous to start fuse out of the dark , substantially given the circumstances I 'm in my career .
That 's really -- I mean , you look at , I 'm pretty young , I have about 40 years .
I still have about four work decacades of work in me .
And it 's very likely that I write about now , it 's going to be judged by the world like the work that came out after the world , as the world as the last book .
I 'm going to be slavery , because we 're all more or not friends here -- I 'm likely that my big success is my shoulder .
Oh , Gesus , who thought !
You know this is the kind of thinking that leads a person to start drink bing up in the nine of the morning and I don 't want to do it .
I would continue to do this work that I love .
So , the question becomes , how ?
And so it looks like , after many reflective , which the way to work to continue to write is to create a psychological construction , right ?
I have to find a safety distance of security between me , which I 'm writing , and my natural anxial rate , which is going to get up . And I was trying to find all the time , trying to find other society to see if they could have more and more healthy ideas to see if they could have more and more healthy ideas , and see if they could have more healthy ideas have more and more healthy knowledge .
how to help the creative people manage to manage the emotional risk of creativity .
And that 's a research that led to the Grek and ancient Rome .
I 'm gonna make me because I 'm in the circle and then comes back .
In the ancient Grek and the ancient Rome -- people didn 't seem to believe that creativity was from men , OK ?
And it was thinking about creativity was this required look at and that they were from men from one of some source distant and unknown , for reasons and unknown , for reasons .
The Greeks called these spiritual divine demand .
Socrate , wonderful , wonderful , believed to have a saggery that was wisdom .
The Rooms were the same idea , but they called that kind of spirit species without a genius .
which is great , because Rooms were really not really thought a genius was somebody genius satively .
They belief that a genius was this kind of divine entity , who was literally in the walls of an artist , a little bit like the elpho Dobby , and who was to see the work of the work of the artist 's work and modeling the result of that work .
Extional -- here 's the distance of which I talk about -- that psychological struction that you protected the results of your work .
And everybody knew that was how it worked , right ?
So the anti-artists were protected by certain things , like , for example , too too much narcion , right ?
If your work was exceptional , you couldn 't take all the merit , you know that you were helped by this incorporate genius .
If your work failure , it wasn 't all your hit , right ?
Everybody knew that was your genius to be an incapable .
And so people han conceived creativity in Occe for a long time .
And then the Rencivement came and changed this big idea ; we put the human being over the universe over the center of the universe above all the mysteries and no mysteries and no mysteries and no mysteries .
This was the rational principal of humanth and people started thinking that creativity was completely from hydm .
And for the first time in history , you start to refit to this or artist as a genius , rather than a person with genius .
And I have to tell you , I think it was a big error .
I think I allow someone , a simple person to believe that they 're like a recipient , the essence and the source of all mysteries divation , creativity , unknowable and ethernal and ethernal and ethernal responsibility is a big file to the human fragile .
It 's like to ask someone to enjoy the sun .
Demutual , and it makes all these ingestivable ingestishable performance .
And I think it was this pressure to have destroyed the artists in passed 500 years .
And , if this is true , and I think it 's , the question becomes , and now ?
Can we do that ?
Maybe you can go back to a more old understanding of human relationship between human and creative mystery .
Or maybe not .
Maybe we can 't sing 500 years of rational thinking in a talk about 18 minutes .
And there 's probably people in the audience that would have to have a legitimate scientific , I 'm sitting on the notion of , but they follow the people by by giving things .
I 'm not convince you all about this .
But the question I 'd like to ask is -- why not ?
Why don 't you think about this way ?
Because it 's more of anything else I 've ever heard about to explain the exasperant impremobility of the creative process .
A process that , as anyone who ever tried to do something -- so , basically , all here -- you know , you don 't compete with rationally .
And in fact , it can sometimes seem completely paranormal .
I did this meeting recently meeting with the amazing Ruth Stone , who has now 90 years , but he was a poetter for all life and told me that during his childhood in the rural Virginia , working outside the camps , and he felt out , inside of if you , when a poem was in if you get them from the Slandscape .
He said he was like a fragriculous train .
And that was rotolling to her landscape .
He felt it , because he was to get to the Earth under his feet .
He knew you have one thing to do at that point and was of words , " running like a math . "
And so he goes to home and she was sent from this poem , and he wouldn 't have to get a piece of paper and a math enough , and a math enough , and the grade and to grade it , and failing it and grade it on the page .
Sometimes he couldn 't be fast enough , so he was running and correct and correct without having to get home and the payoff and the routed poem and she would continue to break through the landscape , and he would continue to break through the landscape , and he was looking for , " another poet . "
And then there were those times -- this piece I 'll never forget this -- there were almost losing , right ?
So , he was running home and he was trying to look at the card , and he was looking through , and he was a pencil in the while he was passing , and then said , which was like if you were to the other hand and the step .
He was a poem from the tail and remain her body and put it into his body and transcent her on the page .
And in these cases , the poem would be on the perfect page , and the last word on the first .
So when I heard it thought -- it 's crazy , it 's exactly the same same as my creative process .
Not all my creative process -- I 'm not a conviction .
I 'm a mule , and my work way to work is ; you know , wake up the same orary every day and play and work and pass it , and I 'm going to be over the goffly .
But even I was in my head , I 've got a little bit of that thing , sometimes .
And I think many of you have the han .
You know , even if the work and ideas came to me from a certain source , I could not walk up honestly .
And what is this ?
And how can we relate to it it in a way that we don 't lose your head , but , rather , what do you do to stay in ?
For me , the best contemporary example of the best example I have is the musician for the Mayer Tom Waits , which I interviewed a newspaper .
We were talking about this , and you know , Tom , for the majorororge of life is the incarnation of the incarnation , trying to control , manage , dominate these species of creative impules .
But then he was invent , he was driving on a road in L.A. , he was driving on a highway to L.A. , changed all over him .
He was going to fast , and all of a traits of this little framework , which was coming in in his head as the inspiration , and the wants , elusive , and the wants , you know , it 's wonderful , and the wants , you know , it 's wonderful , and the desider you know , it 's wonderful , and the desider .
It 's not a piece of paper , it 's not a matt , it 's not a cycle .
So he starts to hear this species of old anxioned as he as , " I 'm going to lose , and I 'm going to habit obsessed by this song sessional sessional song .
I 'm not good enough and I can 't do it . "
And instead of going to the panic , they stop .
He mit the entire process and made something completely new .
He just just just the sky and said , " Scuses I 'm not driving ? "
" You know , it seems to write a song now ?
If you really want to exist , you get back to a moment , I can take care of you .
Other one of the things that are going to be unexpected to the other today .
You know , you know , Leonard Cohen . "
And his work process changed after this .
Not the work , the work was still dark as a always .
But the process , and the heavy anxiety that was releft when he took her genius , the genius was remained by the other problems and I 'm going to get it back from where , realizing that he had no thing , and I 'm going to get it back from where he was , realized that he had no interized .
But you know this peculiar , wonderful bizarre collaboration between Tom and this strange and the outside that was not Tom .
So , as I felt that story started to change the way I I was working and I was already save me .
This idea , I was saved when I was writing " Mangia , Prega , Ama , and fall into one of those cave cause we all working on something and we don 't even even get to the worse book , and we don 't start thinking that it 's going to be a disaster , which is the worst book never written .
Not just ugly , the worst book written .
And I started thinking about therefore .
But then I remind to Tom who was talking to the air and I tried .
So I went up my face on the snites and rid my comments to a vuuum of the room .
And I said , " Have , what we 're both , you know , if this book is not going to be brilliant , isn 't it ?
Because I 'm going to see that I 'm going to get all I have , I have no longer than this .
So if you want to be better , you have to show you and do your side .
OK . But if you don 't do it , you know what , I don 't do anything .
I 'll get to write the same because it 's my work .
And I would like to please that was recorded that I 've presented to do my part , " Because -- at the end is so , OK -- centuries ago in North Africa people were dunched for the dances of the moon , the music that went on and the music that went on and hours to the stuff .
And they were always magnificent , because the dannotion was great professionals .
But every while , rarely , something happened , and one of these artists became translent .
And I know what I 'm talking about , because I know you all saw it , at a point , a performance .
It was like time , and the danno-time , and the dannounced walking through a kind of lander , and he was waste and he was doing anything different from the usual , but all he was aligned .
And suddenly , it doesn 't seem like a human .
But he 's accentioned from the diinside and he 's illuminated in the fuoco of divinity .
And when this was the next one , the people knew what was , they called him .
They had their hands and start singing , " Allah , Allah Allah , Allah , God , " . "
That 's God , you know .
Curious note -- when the Mori invaded Spain , I was this habitude with them and the ready to change in the centuries , " Allah , Allah , Allah , Allah , Allah , " in the south , " which you can still hear in the corries or the flamp .
In Spain , when a artist did something impossible and magic , " Allah , Allah , Allah , Allah , magnificent , good , " uncomprehensive , " incomprehensive -- a last of God .
And it 's great because we need .
But the problem comes the day after , for the dances , when you wake up and discover that 's 11 in the morning of Martedesday and the last last last of God is no longer .
It 's just a great mortal with great hurge , and maybe it 's not going to get that height .
And maybe nobody 's name of God 's God as I 'm even going to do with the rest of his life ?
It 's hard .
This is one of the most painful recognize that I 'm going to make in creative life .
But perhaps it doesn 't have to be so much angoal if you can 't believe , in fact , that the most amazing things than your being come from yourself .
But you might just believe that they 're going to prested from an inimaginable source of this inimagination where you have to go to someone else when you finished .
And , you know , if we think it 's all changes .
And so I started thinking about it , and it 's certainly how I thought I 've thought about many months during the work of the book that I 'll do it , the dangerous , achieved followed my great success .
And what I have to continue to tell me when I feel electric .
Not just just to you . It 's just your work .
You can get to your side presenter , any of your side , any can be .
If you 're dance is dance , blap .
If the divine , I 'm absurd to you , I 'm just going to leave some kind of wonderful wonderful , for one moment through your effort , then , " Oh ! "
Other , you do the same your dance .
And " Out ! " to you the same .
I think , and I think I should teach it .
" Out , " at the same , even for having human love and tests of love and testing cities to make you continue to make you continue to make you continue to make you .
Thank you .
Thank you .
June Cohen : Ole !
As you know I 've talked about some of these projects on the human genome , what it can meaning and the discovery set of new set of genes .
Now we 're starting a new path : we started digitizing biology and now now now starting from that digital code we 're entering and now synthesizing and designing and synthesizing life .
We always tried to ask for a big questions .
" What is life ? " is something that many biologists have tried to understand how livelihood is something that I think they have tried to understand vary levels .
We tried different processes , reduced it to the minimum .
We 're digitizing from almost 20 years ,
When we sequenced the human genome was to passing from the analome of the world 's biology of the computer world .
Now we ask us : can regenerate life , or create new life from this digital universe ?
This is the map of a little organism , Mycoplasma genitalium , which is the species from the smallest genome between the little genome that can authorem in the lab .
And we tried to reduce the genome to create a little bit smaller .
We can eliminate a hundred genes of about 500 genes are here .
But when we look at his metabolic map , it 's relatively simple than our .
So , I think , this is simple .
But when we look at all genes that we can eliminate , one at the time , it 's very unlikely that this can bring to a living cells .
So we decided that the only way to make a little bit of this chromosome that chromosome so that it could modify the components to bring some of these fundamental questions .
And so we started the adventure of " CCCan we synthesize a chromosome ? "
Can there 's chemistry to make these big molecules that we never had to create these big molecules that we never could create before ?
And , in case , can we make a chromosome ?
A chromosome is just a piece of chromosome .
The speed with which we can digitize life is growing up to exponentially .
Our ability to write the genetic code , instead , proproproproproproproproprogret rather slowly , but it 's improving .
And our most recently recent results , the results are recently .
We started over 15 years ago .
The process has been asked a lot of steps , starting with bioetical revision , first experiments that we started with the first experiments .
But we found that synthesize DNA is very hard .
There are tens of thousands of cars in the world that are producing little DNA segments , long , 30 long , long , 30 to 50 letters and it 's a degenerative process : the most grade .
So we had to develop a new method to assemble these fragments and correct the mistakes .
And this was our first attempt , starting with digital genome , X 174 .
It 's a little virus that kills bacteria .
We designed the fragments , we actually designed the error of wrong and achievement , DNA molecule .
The interesting part is when we took this piece of inert material , inert , and we put it into bacteria , the bacteria have started reading this genetic code and to viral the viral particles .
The viral particles have been left by the cells , they went back and return into and destroyed the E.
I talked about recent recent with the oil industry by saying they 're certainly saying they have to do this model .
They have more than you .
We believe this is a situation where software can actually build his own hardware in a biological system .
But we wanted to do things largest in big .
We wanted to build the entire chromosome of the bacteria .
They 're over 580 thousand letters of genetic code .
So we thought we build it in the cassette size of the virus , so that we can change the cassits to understand what the components are of a living cells .
The design is crucial , and if we start with digital information in a computer , these must be very accurate .
When we sequencenced this genome for the first time in 1995 accuracy standard accuracy for every 10 thousand bases .
We found , we resequencency , 30 error . If we had that original sequence we wouldn 't have been able to do it work .
One part of the process is to design 50 letter over long , that they 're going to be overlaunch with all the other 50 letters to build undercyunits to build undercyunits to build little bit more .
We 're trying to unique elements here .
You probably read you you have read that we put in the filanded .
Think about this . We have a genetic code based on four letters : A , C , Gs and T. .
Three of those letters put together about 20 lowing ads , and there 's a specific order of reading for every lominominoid .
So we can use the genetic code to write words , frases , thoughts .
What we did at the beginning was autographed to do this .
Some of them have been dolusans from the fact that it was not poem .
We designed these segments to just join them with enzymes .
There are zymes that repair them and put them on them .
And we started assemble with parts , starting with five to seven miles reading , unending them up to 1,000 letter uns , unending them to get 72 mile and they put them to 72 mile miles on them .
We 've made these segments in abundance so that we can sequence them , so we 're trying to create an extremely robust -- as you 're going to see in a minute .
We 're trying to automatize the process .
So , this seems the tabellon a basket player .
When we get these very long , over 100 miles low low down , the more than 100 miles , they will not grow directly in the E.
You get to the modern instruments of molecular biology .
So we 've looked at other mechanisms .
We knew another mechanism called recombination omologic , which in biology is ulizy to repair the DNA to join the biology to join the DNA to join the DNA .
Here 's an example .
This organism , called Deinococcus radiodurans , can absorbate three million radioduring .
You can see in the upper square like his chromosome as his chromosome is destroyed .
In 12 -- 24 hours , it 's reassembled as it was before .
There are thousands of organisms that they can do it .
These organisms can sit completely .
They can live under empty .
I 'm absolutely sure life exist in space , and you know , to find new riches of water .
ASA showed this , NASA showed this that this is .
This is a picture of molecule that we built by using these processes , just using these processes , just using the lievision of segments to insert .
The yeast assemble them automatically .
This is not taken taken up with a microscope of electronic microscope , but with a microscope .
It 's a molecule so we can see it with a little microscope .
These are pictures that they 're going to do about six seconds .
This is the ad that we 've done little time ago .
They 're over 580,000 letters of genetic code .
It 's the largest molecule of a defined structure that man .
It 's got a 300 million perhaps .
If you stay up with a cartotototockroach 10 without spaces , it would like 142 pages just to transcend this genetic code .
Now , how do we do it work ? how can we activate it ?
Obviously , you leave a virus is a game from kids .
It 's a little bit more complicated when they use bacteria .
It 's simpler cells as well as eucariote cells like our : you can just extract nucleus , you can just extract the nucleus and put another one , which is basically the process of cloning .
In the archaea bacteria , the cromosome is integrated inside the cell , but we recently showed that we can do a little bit complete of a chromosome from one cell to another and activate it .
We clean a chromosome from a microbial cycle .
The two are different as men from mouse .
We 've added some genes in a way that we can decide what to choose to this chromosome .
And then I 'm skip with the enzymes that kill all the proteins .
And when we put it into the cell . And when we put it into the cell .
And we started thinking that we couldn 't go beyond , but we tried to push it over there .
This is one of the major mechanisms of evolution .
We found that a lot of anti-species have added in a second or a third chromosome somewhere , adding in a thousand tracts in a second thousand tracts of the species .
So who think about evolution as a gene at the time that it has not been a lot of biology .
They 're in the enzymes called restriction enzymes that they 're going to digest DNA .
The chromosome that was in the cell not one .
The cell phone chromosome that we put into the chromosome .
He was expressed , and he recognized the other extreme as extreme material , and he 's masticated it , and we found it with only the cell cell ell and the new chromosome .
It became blue because of the genes we put into .
And in a short ort , all the characteristics of a species , I went . And we went through all new species , based on the new software that we put into a cell .
All the protein changed , the members have changed , and when we read the genetic code , exactly what we 've transferred to what we 've transferted you .
Now , this might seem to be genetic altering , but altering DNA software , we can change things in substantial way .
Now , I 've explained that this is not about genesis -- but of progress from three million years and a half million years of evolution , and I 've already told that maybe we 're going to create a new version of Cambriana in which will be created new species on this digital process .
Why do that ?
I think it 's obvious enough when we think about our needs .
We 're going to move from six and a half billion people in the next 40 years .
Just to give an example : I was born in 1946 .
Now there are three people on the planet for each of the 1946 , there 's four years .
We 're having problems now to find food , fresh water and clean , medical water and well-to-half billion people .
It 's going to be more harder to do it for nine billion .
We use more than five billion carbon , more than 30 billion carbon , more than 30 billion barians .
That means a hundred million baries a day .
When we try to find biological processes , or any kind of process to replace them , it 's going to be a huge challenge .
We have to keep the whole hemimission of CO2 from these materials that is runs into the atmosphere .
At day , thank you to scientific discovery all around the world , we have a database with about 20 million genes , and I like to think they are the design components for the future .
The electronic industry has only a dozen about components , and think about how many different things came out .
Our limitations here are data that 's reality and our imagination .
Now we have some techniques , thank you very rapid synthesization , able to create what we call combinatory genomics .
We can build a big robot that can produce a million million chromosomes a day .
Think of processing these 20 million genes , or to prove the processes to produce eight-hold or drugs , new vaccines , we can change , thank you to a little team , and create more biology now that over the last 20 years of science .
And it 's just a standard selection .
We can choose to survival , chemical production or fuel , or fuel production , or fuel production .
This is an instantaneous instantaneous software programmed that we 're working to be able to sitting and design species to computers .
Well , we don 't necessarily know how it will be .
We know exactly what their genetic code .
Now we 're focused on the fourth generation of fourth generation .
You also see you that extract ethanol from grate , it 's an experiment finished .
We have a second and third generation that 's going to be used to be sugar with sugar fuels like the eight-up , or different kinds of butanol butanol .
But the only way the biology can have a great impact without increasing the cost of food and limitargue the cost of food and limitaring the cost of the same thing that we 're working to design cells that we can have the first carbon design cells that they can achieve this purpose , and we think we can have the first carburvering of four or more months .
The solar light with CO2 is a metodo-- but in our discoveries all over the world , we have found different methods .
This is a organism that we described in 1996 .
It lives in the deep ocean , at about 2,500 feet deep at at the temperature of water .
They create meter from CO2 molecular hydrogen molecular as energy source of energy .
We 're trying to figure out if we can be sent with CO2 , which can easily be transported through tubes , converting that CO2 in the fuel , to drive this process .
So , short , we think we could be able to increase what the basic question of " which is , " We , grew the basic question of , " What is life , we have the goal of replace the whole oil industry .
Exactly . If you can 't do it from TED , where can ?
It would become a main foundation of energy .
Meeeethods to create instantaneous vaccine vaccine .
You 've seen this year with flu , we 're always back to a year and with a dollar , at least when it 's about to find the right vaccine .
I think what you can change by building vaccines in combinable vaccine .
That 's how the future might start to look at , now , the tree of evolution , now , accelerating evolution with synthetic bacterial cells , areas , and finally , arches , and finally finally cells .
We 're so far from improving people .
Our purpose is to do that in a way to live enough to try to do it . Thank you very much .
First of all , I 'll show you , the fastest possible , some fundamental technology we brought to Microsoft in follow a year ago . This is Seadragon .
It 's an environment that you can interact with is local level that remote with a huge amount of visual data .
So here we 're seeing a lot of gigabyte digital phoom , with a kind of expensive zoom and continuous , for a quick velopanoramic , avails we want it .
And not matter how big it is the amount of information we see , how big these collection of data or images .
Most of the most of the digital photographs , but this is a scanning provenient , from the Library of Congress , and it reenter the gamp of 300 megapixels .
It doesn 't make any difference because the only thing that 's limited the prestations of a system like this is the number of pixel on your screen in any time . It 's also very flective architecture .
This is a book , an example of data not images .
This is the Casa desolate Dickens . Every colonn-colonn-tail .
To show you that 's just about it and not images , we can do something like that , to actually see that this is of a real real representation of the text , not a picture of a picture .
It could be a way a little artificial way to read an electrbook .
Not you don 't have to do my own .
This is a more realistic example . It 's a number of The Guardian .
Every image is the beginning of a section .
And it really gives you the pleasure of reading the real cartoy version or a new-to-thick , or a new-to-thick , which is for a molteplant .
We also did something with the corner of this number in the particular number of The Guardian .
We 've created a higher advertising ads -- much higher than what you use in an advertising the advertising of the content .
If you want to see the characteristics of this automobile , you can see here .
Or other models , or even the techniques .
And this really shows some of these ideas to eliminate the space of the screen on the screen .
I hope that means to fire up to the end up with pop-up and other porcheries like , I don 't have to be necessary .
Of course , the map is one of the most obvious applications for this kind of technology .
And I don 't want to lose time , if I don 't say we have contribute to give it in this field .
These are all the streets in the U.S. overoveroveroverall the way down the NASA .
So now we go to something else .
This is now from the Web ; you can go to the web .
This is a project called Photosynthy , which combine two different technologies .
One is Seadragon and the other is a visual research at very interesting computers by Noah Snavely , a student of the University of Washington , with Steve Seitz of UW Seitz and Rick Szz eliski Rick and Microsoft Rick . An n n n n n n n . An n n n n n 't good .
And it 's from the alive on the web , managon Seadragon .
You can see this when we do this kind of skills , where we can go from a image to the other and have this kind of experience .
But the space collocation of images here has actually a meaning .
The computer algorithms of computers have recorded these images together , so that they corresponding to the real areas that I have all taken neighbors in the Rockenized Laghi , and these things are all linked . Here , you see the elements of a slightly show of a slightly show , and these things are all of space .
I don 't know if I have time to show you some other environment .
There are a lot more space .
I want to go directly to one of the original data from Noah-- and this is from a previous prototype of Photosynth-snth that we 've done in the web expected to do the first time for the early summer , the technology Photosynthrowing this technology , the technology technology technology , Photosynthynthrows , and it 's not necessarily obvious looking at the environments we put in in the website .
We had to worry about legal aspects and so on .
This is a reconstruction of Notre Dame images that was made by Flickr . Basta digitory , Notre Dame , Flickr and you get images of types in the liquiring , other of the campus and so on . Ogness , one of these orange arange areas representing to this model .
So , they 're all images from Flickr and they 've been linked to spatial level in this way .
And you can navigate this very very very very very very simple way .
You know , I would never have thought to end up for Microsoft .
It 's very gratificent receiving this kind of accovery here .
I think you can see that it 's a lot of different kinds of photocameras : from the ones of the ones to the professional ones to the SLR , a number meanative , put together in this environment .
And if I can , I try to find out some strange .
Many of them are faces , etc .
Somewhere you have a series of photographs -- here 's a series of photographs -- here .
This is a poster of Notre Dame recorded correctly .
We can go from posters to the physics of this environment .
The essential point is that we can do things with social environment . This is now taking data from sudtissue data interior the whole memory of how it looks like the Earth 's 's view -- and connected to all those data together .
All those pictures become connected together , the major of the parts .
You have a model of the land that emerging .
Think about this as a prolungation of Stephen Lawler on Earth .
It 's something that grows in complexity as as as well as people use , and the advantages to increase with use .
Their pictures are husbed with inseries on other people .
If you get the idea of contracting all these sannotion , my picture of Notre Damn suddenly , I can actually enriched all those data , and I can use it as a point of enterprise to immerate all those data , and I can use the photo anyone else , and have a red social experience , and have a red social experience of a red , and the red social experience of the red and the red cross-user experience .
Of course , a consequence of all this is very virtual models of every interesting part of the Earth , and the other people collective and and satellite images and satellite images and similar images and like the similar memory .
Thank you .
CA : I 've got to understand ? What your software is that you 're going to take to do is that at a certain point , in the next few years , all of the world 's next few years , all the world 's going to be clink together ?
BAA : Yes . What 's doing is basically discovered .
It 's creating hyperlink , if you want , you want , between images .
And it 's doing it in the base of the content of images .
The thing becomes very interesting if you think about the semantles of semantated information that many of these images .
As when you do a research research on the web , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , the photos of the images of the picture .
Now , what happens if that picture is you connect all your pictures ?
So the amount of semantical interconnection and the amount of wealth that comes to really big . It 's a classic effect of the network .
CA : Blaise , it 's really amazing . Compliments .
BAA : Thank you very much .
One of the main pleasure when you travel and one of the thetnographics of the ethnographics is the way we have antic . The people who have no antic traditions , between the wind the wind , you have the past in the wind the wind , levig-le-ft-foot pleased .
And I think , the skiamans Jaguar travel again , the Milky Way , or the Meky Way Mealayas are still collighting , or Himalayas , the buddians inlow still the breath the Dhardians , but that the idea that the central importance of anthropology , and the idea that the world that we live in absolute , but it 's just a model of reality , but it 's just a model of reality , but it is actually a model of reality ,
the consequence of a particular adaptive set of adaptative choices that our estrpe has done , well or evil , many generations ago .
And , of course , we all share the essential tracts .
We all try . We all try .
We are subjects to start .
We have to death inexorability of death , so we don 't surprising and whom we 're whom we 're whom we 're whom we 're going to --
We all have an art .
What hits is the particular pitch of song , the rhythm of the dance of every culture .
It doesn 't matter that they 're the Penan forests of Borneo , or the follow of the Vodoo doo 's Vodoo 's the Kenysettentries , or the Curandero of Ande , or a check in the Sahara hert in the heart of the Sahara .
He was my journey companion in desert a month ago , or a yak in the yak of Qomolangma , the wild 's deaths of the world .
All these people teachers teachers have other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , other ways of being .
And , if you think , you think , it 's a concept that it can give you hope .
To together , together , the myriades of the world create a spiritual life , and the world 's important cultural life that is the planet and it 's important to the well-being of the planet as a biological ragnote as biosphere .
And you can think of this rague cultural agder as an ethnosphere and you can call the total sum , the total sum of all concepts , dreams , ideas , inspirations , ideas , intuitions , ideas , bringing up of human aware .
The etnosphere is the fantastic patrial patrimonium of humanity .
It 's the symbol of what we are and what we can be in how inquisitive species .
And because it was so so , biosphere was very , very , very quickly , it was very quickly consumed at the thnosphere and unfortunately faster .
Nobody 's biologist , for example , 50 percent of all species was or is on the orders just the orders of the only one because it 's fell , or -- in the most apocalypots -- in the field of biological diversity .
The index of all that is , of course , the language loss .
When you were born 6,000 languages on this planet .
A language is not composed by a vocabulary or a series of rules .
A language is the human spirit of the human spirit .
It 's the half of the animal that 's animal that 's the animal world .
Every language is a forest , a rainy , a background , thinking , a spiritual possibility .
And of those 6,000 languages , as we 're here to Monterey , at least half the people are not sustake in the children 's ears in the children .
They don 't get to kids , which means , unless you have to be taught , unless you have something that 's already death .
What is there more sad than being had silence , the last speaking a language , the last speak , of being the last speaking a language , the wisdom of the promise of the kids ?
This is a pherging with someone in the world every two weeks : every two weeks a old muor and door with them in the last silver tomb and and door with with with with the tomboy sills a language .
And I know somebody you will say , " Don 't it much better ?
The world would not be a better place if we 're talking to all the same language ? "
Let 's talk about kogi .
You 'll get to a tract thing that is not to talk about your language .
I 'd love to do a journey through the thnosphere --
a little journey in the etnosphere to give you a hip of what we 're losing .
Many of us forget that when I say " different ways of existing ways of existing .
Let 's take for example , Barasana 's a sett-settentrional Amazonia , who cream the myth of the anacond , which creates the myth to come from the river of the east sacures of sacond sacred sacred saconia .
It 's a people who can 't distinguish the blue color from the verse blue from the versus because the time you 're identified in the forest , which depends the population .
They have a strange language and a matrimonial rule , said , " You have to marry a person who 's talked to marry a different language .
And all that has roots in the past mythological past , though the particularity is that in these exdate families in which they talk about six or seven languages , because of the mystery one language .
They 're limited to listen to and then start talking .
We take one of the most interesting tribes I lived , the Waorans of Ecuador north , an incredible popular people who had the first contact of the 1958 .
In 1957 , five missionary missionary contact .
They did down from the top photographs that they thought they 'd have to get them into a packaging that this people 's population that this people in the pluvial forest had never seen anything bi-size of a two-dimensional size .
They picked up the land , they 've been showed up with a shape or a shape , and , not finding anything , they would have concluded that they were the hell , and they kill the five missioners with the lance .
But the Waorans didn 't kill the foreign .
They were killing them in their own .
54 percent of the mortality was caused by themselves .
We have up eight generations to eight generations and we found two natural death and when we reinated them to know , they had admit that one of them was aging so that they had been aging , and then killed him the same .
The hunters were able to recognize the animal urine animal urine .
In the early ' 80s , I had a very interesting task when my professor of Harvard , and he asked me if I wanted to go to Haiti to sweet Haiti to the basic Web of the power of Duvalier and Tonton Macodes , and they were Tonton Macodes , and I would have been able to do the zombie .
To give a sense of mirailing , I would have to understand Vodoo culture , and the Vodoo 's not magic .
It 's pretty much about a metapphysical vision of the world .
Much interesting .
If I ask you to tell me the great religions of the world , what would you say ?
Cristianism , Islam , Buddismo , Ebraism , etc .
A continent is always left out , thinking that sub-Saharan Africa doesn 't have any religious feels . And they do and the Vodoo is not the other than the distilside of these things very profound born during the tragic concepts of slavery .
What makes the interesting voodoo is the intense relationship between life and death .
So , you know , they gave the spirits .
The spirits can be invoced by the Great Acqua , they respond to the rhythm of the dance of the dance of the face of the following the following becomes the god .
So , for this voodooists , you know , you know , you know , white , you go on to church .
We give God in the temple and we 're going to say God . "
And from the moment you 're possessed , is the spirit that I drive you , how bad do you ?
So you see these incredible events of these incredible events of the traance of the traance that you can touch up to the infuzzy demonstration rather strong demonstration of the power of mind when it 's catalyzed in a state of extreme exciting .
In all people who have been lived the most amazing that I lived the most amazing is the Kogi of Sierra Nevada Santa Marta , in Colombia .
Sendent of the ancient civilization that was a time living on the caraiban planetary of the Colombia , the people retreat the Colombia , the people were safety of the Colcanic massive planning .
In a continent macked continent macked , this people never been conquisted by the Spanish .
So they 're governmented by a clergy , but their formation is really amazing .
The young people following them come from the families to three or four years , and live in a world of buy and shadow into a world that 's done for 18 years .
Two periods of nine years choices to reproduce the nine months of management that spend in the user-and-a-and-a-year-old hores .
For all this time , they 're acculturate for their society , values that they 're predicting that their prayers and only their prayers and only their prayers , or to say the balance balance -- or to say the balance balance .
At the end of this incredible initiation is suddenly taking out and for the first time in their life , at 18 years , they see a dawn . And in that active of consciousness , when the sun is the vallexiety of the beautiful landscape , all that they 've learned in theory . The pret is a step back and says , and it 's saying , and it 's : The pret does a step back and say ,
" Vissue ? I 'm like I told you .
It 's wonderful . Now it 's now to you protect it . "
They call the major brothers and say that we , the minor brothers , we are the destruction of the world .
This level of intuition is extremely important .
When we think about Ingence and the environment to the environment invites , we can see Rousseau and the old history of noble , which is a concept in his simplicity or maybe we 're even even even invoice .
Ingenes are not no fefeeling or feeling .
There is no space for these things in the malaric palual Asmat or the winds , but thank you to the Tibet 's bs , but because of time and the rual , they created a mystic intuition of the Earth 's unconsciously unconsciously .
What does that mean ?
That means a little girl of Ande who growing up in the Muntain , it 's a spirit of Apu who will lead his destiny destiny , and it 's going to have a very different human being , and it will have a very different relationship with the mountain , or that respect to a boy of Montana who grows up in the Montana who 's growing up to be down .
That 's the dimored of a mineral or a mineral ction is irrelevant .
What is interesting is the metaphor that defines the relationship between the individual world .
I grew up in the rainforests of the Columbia believing that the forests were cut .
This made me a human being different from my friends Kwautl who believe that the forests are the forests of Hukuk and the bis historical bey-based dise and the blind spiriters who are living at at the north of the world , the spiriters that they face during the Hamatsa .
If you start to look at these these cultures can create different realities , you can start to understand some of them feelings . We take this plant .
I took this picture to the aprile in the nordoctor in the western Amazon .
Mayahujury , the most powerful psychopahically , the most powerful psychotic substance .
What makes the thing that makes the ayahuash is not the phaneful antial potential of the substance of the substance , but his own elaboration . It 's composal by two elements .
On the side , this land-a-bunch that has a series of carboline , harmful and harmful , slightly hallucinogenic and harmoline , and harmful .
Paking the only plants , you have a bluster blusters , and it 's a little bit of consciousness , but it 's made the hilation of a coffee family said Psychotria , and it 's called Psychotria vision of coffee .
This plant has powerful tripptaminine powerful tripptamine-5 , dimethoxptamine-5 , methoxyptamine .
If you ever see the Yanomami you 'll see the Yanomami I make a different set of set , it contains methoxyptamine .
Tiring that powder on the nose is a little bit like being dissolution of paper dipinbars and land on a sea of electricity . Resate not creates a distorsion of electricity ; it creates of reality ; it creates of reality .
I was often with my professor , Richard Evan Shultes , the man who went down down the mid-to-green , with his discovery of the fungi of the hallucinogenic fungi in the ' 30s in Mexico .
I think about my roof you can 't classifly these tripptamine as because if you 're not going to tell anyone of being hallucinated .
It 's possible to be at the horally only if they 're assume with other chemicals that you know , they know , you know , you know , you know ,
Now it 's the beautiful : beta-carboline inhibits are inhibors in this lian , the same kind of necessary to potentiate tripes . The question is spontaneous , in a flecture : in a flech of 80,000 species of plant , how do these people have been two dealing morogically not similar , but that if you combine in this way , create a biochemical version that is superior at the sum of the sum of the amounts of parts ?
We use the great eupherror of proof the error , which can reveal infrual .
But if you ask the Indians , they 'll tell us , " Please . "
What does that mean ?
This tribes , Cofan , has 17 variety of ayahuca , who distinguish , which is narely ningue in the forest , and that our eyes would remain the forest .
If you ask them how they 're stable they 'll tell us , " I was going to tell us , " I was thinking , " I was thinking , " No . "
The solution is : You take the 17 variety of a full of a full flowing and each one will cannot with a little bit different .
With this not graduate in Harvard , but it 's much more interesting to contact the stami .
Now , [ applausans ] the problem is that even the ones of us who have been hearing people who have paintoresced paintoresks , but somehow redots to our real world , and it 's more .
In fact , the 20th century , it 's not going to remind for his wars or the technologic , but as the thing that 's where we stopped and actively embraced actively or accepted passively or accepted passively , or passively accepted or passively . Now the problem is not change .
All cultures through the centuries have been involved in a new chance of life .
And the problem is not technology .
The Indians Sioux have no people to be Sioux when they put up with arc and they put them in the American and the next next thing and the American and cites as well as well as the American and cites .
It 's not the change or technology that threatening the integrity of ethnosphere . It 's the power .
The flight of the domination .
And if you look at the world , you 'll find that these are not destinated cultures that these are not destinated cultures .
They are living creatures and dynamics outside of the forces from existence to force identifiable that go beyond their adaptation capacity .
I know that you 're disboscation in the potential of Penan --
a people who have been known for Sarawak , in the south-west asian in the forest to a generation ago , and now reduced to a generation ago , and now reduced to the reduction on the revers , where you can see the river that it seems to be a half of the list that it 's taken place to Meridional Meridional Meridional Meridional Meridional Meridional Meridional Meridionds , where you could can see the horizon the horizon the sought ,
I 'm going to fill the stam with the dream of suit to the forest .
Or in the case of Yanomami , they 're the disease that I 've come with the discovery of the gold .
If we move on on on the mountain of Tibet , where I 'm doing a lot of research , you 'll see the hard hard flight of political domination .
As you will know the genocide , the physical extinction of a people , is conviction of the world , but the ethnocide , the destruction of a popular life , not only is conconviction , but I 'm not convicted , because it 's a part of development .
And you can 't understand the suffering of Tibet until the beginning .
I 've been a lot of the 6,000 miles from Chengdu in Western Chengdu through the Tibet sour-bet with a young colleague , but only arrived in Lhasa , I realized what 's behind the statistics we hear .
6,000 sacres reduced into dust and cenjoyed .
1.2 million people killed by military military during the Cultural Revolution .
The father of this guy was ascriticized at Panchen Lama .
which means that it was killed when I was killed at the time of Chinese invasion .
Her , I was I skied with Santity durity that he took taken taken people in Nepal .
Her mother was imprigioned and his colpe was to be rich .
It was brought to habit to the age of two years hidden under his gonna because he couldn 't have a little bit of him .
The sister , which did the same , was put in reeducational field .
A day he inaved a day , he had a coffern fascial fascil of Mao and , for this transgression , was put it in the jobs for seven years .
The pain of Tibet is unbet , but the reesterday of the people 's people from hold .
And then , it 's all the way you reduce to a choice .
We want to live in the monoonia world 's policy or we want to acallow the world of policy , or we want to acallow the world of diversity ?
The great paper Margaret Mead , before he died to die from the world said that his biggest fear was that , in our way to this amord . We 're going to see the whole range of human imagination to a limitate modality , but one day we 're going to wake up from a sleep , but one day we 're going to wake up from a sleep to be .
And it 's umillion of the remind that our species is been existence for 600,000 years .
The Neolitics Revolution , who gave us the agriculture , which has done us subject to the seed of the seed of the seed of the skiaming of the check , creating the hierarches of specialization , and we talk about 10,000 years ago .
The modern world indualized is 300 years old .
That 's a story , it doesn 't suggest that we have the answers to all the challenges we 're going to have to deal with .
When they 're in these cultures of the world is asked what it means to be human , they respond to 10,000 different voices .
And it 's in these answers that we all will be what we are : a kind of conscious , which has to make all the people and all the gardens can be what all the people and all the gardens can fire .
I took this picture on the north extremity of Baffin the island , when I went to the whales with Inuit , and this man , Olaya , and this man , Olayas , Olayas , and this man , Olayas , and this man , Olayas , and this man , Olayas , and this man , Olaya , and this man , Olaya , and this man , Olayas of Baffin the Inuit , and this man , Olayas I went to the grandfather with the grandfather with the grandfather .
The Canadian government was not always gentle with the Inuit 's people to stabilize our suprematic , we have to hurt our suprematic ,
The grandfather of this man refutterly to go .
The family , I temning her life , and I took them all the boundaries .
You have to know that Inuit doesn 't ffreeze the cold , they exploit .
The packs were sleep in the origin were made of pain .
The grandfather of this man didn 't put out from the night or the library of the library , and they had suffering .
It 's sgattle , he took the pants in the focused in the skin and defecated in your hand . When I did it congelated , the working working working on the mobile .
He sprying up on the dog of this haunt himself , and when he became solid , killed a dog .
He 's taken out of the dog and created a brighter , with the tory cass made a sleep , and he 's gone on the bucks , he 's brought up on the front of the banks , hell the caccess to the hake .
We want to talk about cavarself-resilience of all ? Radies . And this , in different ways , [ Applausi is the symbol of the resilience of the Inuit 's popular Inuit 's 's the symbol of the world .
In the aprile of 1999 the Canadian government has regiven the total control of an area of the biggest territory of California and Texas put together .
It 's their new potria . It 's called Nunut .
It 's an independent territory . They don 't have any mineraries .
One examples of how a natione-state can recognize with his people .
And , to finish , I think it 's pretty obvious at least at the people who 's us in these remote areas , I think they 're not remote remote that they 're not remote .
For someone is home .
They representing the sections of human imagination that will be at the dawn . And for all of us , the dreams of these children , as the dreams of our children , become part of the nuda geography of hope .
And finally , we have a convinced that politicians will never come to nothing .
We believe that the polemides --
[ Applausi is not persuasive , but we believe that the stories can change the world , and maybe we 're the best institution to tell the world the world . Every month of our website is to reach 35 million visit lights .
156 countries , they transmit our television channel .
Our magazine are thlletter from millions of people .
Our work is to travel in the etnosphere to bring our audience in cultural places that are going to be brought out of how they have seen and , you hope , above the central reveal reveal , the central world of existing the world of existing in diversity , and we have to find a life in the diversity , and we have to find a life in a pluralist and multicultural world 's life in a pluralist and we have to find a life in the world of life in the diversity ,
where the wisdom of all people can contribute to our collective welltive welltive welltive welltive well-being .
Thank you .
I 'm going to talk about some things that I wrote in this book that I hope I 'm going to try to figure out some connections , in case you don 't see them .
I want to start with what I call " the official dogma . "
The official dogma ?
The official dogma of all the Western society 's recial dogma , you know , if we want to massimilar the well-being of our citizens . "
The reason is , from one side , in fact that freedom is in itself a value , is very precious , useful , essential for human beings .
On the other is that if we 're free , each of us can act to do everything that massive to do everything that massive , no one that you can do with no one that I decided to say our well-being , no one who 's decides .
The way to massive freedom is massive choice .
More choices people have , the more are free , and more , the more , the more of the well-being .
This , I think , is so deeply rooted in society that nobody would dream of puts it in doubt .
And it 's also deeply rooted in our lives .
I 'll show you some examples of what progress has made possible .
This is my supermarket . It 's not particularly big .
I lose a simple note about condments .
In my supermarket is 175 , no concern 10 variety of extravergage oil 's 175 , the 12 acet-a-co-to-pe-to-boundaries that nobody of 175 ready is your deal with your circumstance .
That 's how the supermarket .
And then you go to the walk up the wild store : casse , CD lector , radio lector , piaright , amplificator .
And in this single core electronic store , there 's a big number of audio components .
We can make six million and a half million different combinations using the components that there are only one store .
You have to admit that there is lots of choice .
Both : the world of communications .
Once , when I was a child , you could get all the desire phone services , and pitch that they were forced by mama Bell .
You had the phone , you didn 't buy it .
A consequence of that , the phone was not reaching .
These days , they went .
Now we have a variety of telephones , especially between cell phones .
That 's the future cell .
My favorite is the one in the middle , MP3 , cut them out of nose , and shug for the brulthy of the brulthele .
If you don 't have yet seen it in the store under home , you 're well certain that soon .
And what happens is that people come in in the stops and ask this question . And you know what the answer is , " No . "
You can 't buy a cell phone that doesn 't do too much .
So , in other life that are much more important than aquers than aquicians , they 're real , the same thing is the same choices .
Assistence health : no longer in the United States that you go from the doctor and say what you have to do .
Instead , I went to the doctor , and the doctor says , " OK , we could do A , or B , " A has these benefits and these answers , " Bs has these benefits and risks . What do you want to do ? "
You say , " Doc , what should I do ? "
And the doctor says , " You have these benefits and these blindness , and B has these benefits and these bits . "
" What do you want to do ? "
And you say , " Doc if she was me , what would it do ? "
And the doctor : " But I 'm not . "
The result , we call it " mality " authonomy of malate , expression that makes it look like .
But actually , it 's not that a weight and responsibility to make decisions from someone who knows something , which is the doctor , to someone who knows , and almost certainly , and so much of course , it 's maled -- and so much of the patient to decisions patient patient .
There 's a huge marketing of drug products , direct to people like me and you , that if you think you don 't have any sense , because you can 't buy them .
But if we can 't buy them , why do you have to buy them ?
The answer is that they want you to give them to be a doctor to ask them to change the recipe .
That 's a fundamental identity is our identity orm is a choice of choice , as you see in this wish , " We don 't want to force children to force their own right time at the right time . " " We don 't get more an identity : we have to invent .
And we can reinvent how many times we do .
which means that every morning , to the answering , you have to decide what you want to be .
I think about family and marriage , a time perspective , a common time , which was almost to anyone , was that you were married the most earlier possible , and you started to get the most earliest possible .
The only real choice was with who , not when , and even even what to do after .
Ose it 's really really about play .
I teach students , and I do 20 percent of smart at less than a time .
And not because they 're brilliant , not because they 're less diligent .
but why I 'm impensive , I mean , I should I be able to marry or not ? Would I have to married or not ? Would I do this now ? "
" Would I have to marry later ? I 've got to think before I got to the kids or career ? "
They 're interrogatives logoranants .
And they 're trying to answer these questions , even if this implesson , even if this implessing , and not getting a beautiful vote to my exame .
And they have to actually do it . I 'm important questions .
Now , the work : We are lucky , like Carl , because technology allows us to work every minute , every day , every day from every corner of the planet , except from every corner of the planet , except that from Hotel Randolph .
I 'm a lot of the way there , there 's a corner , and I won 't tell anyone where where where the WiFi works .
I don 't tell you , because I want to use it .
What does this mean , this amazing choice of choice that we have to work ? Is it we have to decide , continuously , if we have to work or not .
We can go to see our son playing hot , with the cell phone in a pocket , Blackberry in the other , and the news news , typically , on the ckinock .
And even if they are all spent that we see our child ruining , we 're also asking the partners , we 're also asking , " Did I have to answer this call ? "
" I have to answer this email ? I have to habababababababababababsolutely ,
And even when the answer is " no , " all this makes the experience of your son 's game of your son , very different than what would be in other conditions .
So , from any part of the look , little , little , big , materials and large materials , life is a question of choice .
Once the world was this : There was some chance , but not all was a choice of choice .
The world 's looks like today looks like this : The dilemma is , " Is it a good thing , or negative ?
The answer is Sweet .
So , positive lates you all know , so I 'll talk about negative ones .
This is what 's about these two negative effects on people .
The first , paradoxically , is that it produces paralyces instead of liberation .
With a lot of options between which choosing , becomes very hard to do it .
I give you an example : a conduct for a conduct plans .
A colleague has had access to the On On the data of pinindepension , the gigantic society , with about a million clients in 2,000 different companies .
What she found is that for every 10 solutions that are offered in more , the percentage of two percent .
With 50 offer-source offerals , there 's 10 percent in less than adhesions than five . Why ?
Because with 50 sources between which choosing , is maledettly difficult to decide , and choice is still that they 're standing in inmormorning .
And to ask tomorrow , and again tomorrow , tomorrow , tomorrow , and of course , we 're not going to get .
You know , it doesn 't mean that these work from old old work , because they will not have enough money , it 's not enough money , they want to say that the decision is so so hostical source that allow the dator of the work .
They 're not participating , they 're losing until five thousand dollars a year from the work , which would be well , in fact , they would be willing to be .
So , the paralysis a consequence of having too too many choices .
And I think it makes the world that 's like this .
" And to finish , " and the keternity : ketchup , senape or maion ? "
You 'd have to take the right decision , if it 's for ethernity , right ?
You don 't want to choose the wrong function , and you don 't even want to choose to the wrong condition .
So this is the first effect . The second is that even if we can avoid paralysis and do a choice , we 're less resulted by the results of the results of how we were with less options in which choose .
And this for different reasons .
One of these is that with many conditions between which choosing , if you buy one and not perfect , it 's easy to imagine that you could have done a different choice that you could have been better . And what happens is that the alternative you imagine that you might have been better . And what happens is that the alternative of choice , and the replace the replace the for decision , and the replace the replace the represented by decision .
even when it was a good decision .
More choices there are more choice than any details that you have to be insodation-option of choice option .
Meover , there 's what economists call constant opportunity .
Dan Gilbert asked very well stamattine as the value that we give things up to what we confront them .
Once , when there are many options , it 's easy to representing the features of alternative , and being less resilience of option that you have to be less satisfied .
Here 's an example . I 've all been a lot of people who are not New York .
But that 's what you 'd probably think of .
There is this couple to Hamptons .
A lussit place .
It 's all about splendid . It 's all for them .
Not nothing . But what he thinks is , " Well , the day-a-herent , it 's Agoddle . "
" All my neighbors in Manhattan . "
" I could talk about giving right in front of home . "
And he 's going to spend two weeks of losing -- every day -- the chance of parking , where he wants .
The constituent opportunity decrease the reserve for what we have , even when choice was excellent .
And the other the options we have to look , the more the characteristics will be against how constituent will come against how constituent will come up against how constituent .
Here 's another example .
This is a little dream telling us a lot .
It 's talking about living time , and maybe living slowly .
But the most important point is that anything you 're going to choose to , you 're not going to do other .
The things that we don 't choose to be active to be less active what we do .
Third point : the spiral of expectations .
I tried it on my skin bought bling a new jeans .
I 'm like jeans .
Once , the jeans were just like , buying them and bought from besy , and they were brought them a life and work , and they were a lot of times , they started to go well .
So I went to buy a couple of the old old old , and I said , " You need a couple of jeans , this is my cut . "
The commonitor said , " Li wants fit , queen slim , relaxed ? "
He wants to the cernier or buttons ? " Stoneaghed " or " acidasure ? "
" Look want to hold them ? "
" Hight them to take them or stretched to blaunch .
I was sballoon , and after a little bit , I could say , " I want the guy that was the only guy , " I had no idea what was , so for a moment , I tried to all the evil , I tried to the best jeans , and I went out to the best jeans that I had ever had .
It was the massive . With all that I had the best .
But I felt worse .
Why ? I wrote a whole book to understand it .
The reason I was worse , I was with all that choice my expectations were high , jeans had to be perfect .
I was going to have expectations . I didn 't expect anything about exceptional when there was just one guy saw one different , but when I saw 100 different steps , at least one had to be perfect .
What I had achieved was good , but not perfect .
After I had compared to what I was trying to do , I was just satisfied in compared to the expectations .
The addition of options in life of people don 't do that increase the expectations that these have respect to ecrains .
And this will produce less lifetime , even when the results are good .
Nobody in the world of marketing if you realize .
Because if they knew , you wouldn 't know what I 'm talking about .
The truth looks more about this .
" You had better when he was worse . " The reason that was better when he was worse was that when he was worse was even even before , and it was even worse than we could meet the surprised pleasure .
Over the world we live in -- opulents , industry , citizens , town , industry with the expection of performance -- the massive that we can hope is that things are on the altitution of expectations .
You don 't have surprised , because your expectations , my expectations , you have ingantic .
The secret of happiness -- what you 're here is , " Baxis is , " Yes , you want . "
I mean , little carpet moment -- which I 'm really married and my wife is really wonderful .
I couldn 't have done , I couldn 't have any of them .
But it 's not always a bad thing .
And finally , a consequence of buying a couple of jeans , when there is just that kind of jeans is that when you 're not satisfied , and ask you , " Why ? "
" Who is responsible ? " , the answer is clear .
The world is responsible . What can I do with it ?
When there are hundreds of kinds of jeans , and you bought a insodatisfactor , and ask you who is responsible , is the responsible , is the clear , it 's as a clear , you 're the responsible you .
You could have done better .
With hundreds of variety of varieties that are not excuses .
So when people take decisions , even if the outcome is valid , they feel satisfied , they feel satisfied and they 're going to hold them .
In the last years , the depression is exploded in the industry .
I think a factor -- not the only one , but important -- of this honate honate is that people have delusion , because people have deluse experiences because the standard are too high .
And when they have to explain this , they think that they 're their herself .
So the final result is that we 're in general results , objectively , but we feel worse .
Let me remember .
This is the official dogma , what we all take for good and it 's completely fake .
There 's no doubt that a little bit of choice is better than I don 't have any of doing at all , but it doesn 't take a little bit of choice is better than a little bit .
There 's a critical value , I don 't know what it is .
But I 'm sure we 've been enough to get through a piece of level where the choices improve our life .
Now , from political point of view -- I 've almost finished -- from political point of view , the peekeepers is the following .
What allows this whole choice in the industrial society is the wealth .
There are a lot of places in the world , and you know , where the problem is not that they have any choice .
The problem is they have too poor .
So the factory that I 'm talking about is a malbeing exclusive to modern , Western society .
And what it does to deprespress and angry is this : Steve Levitt talked about yesterday yesterday of how much those expensive and discoseats and unuseful ways .
I mean , these choices , complicated and available , it 's not that they 're just useful .
I 'm actually deleteries of deleteries .
They do worse .
If a little bit of what our society in our society , it would have a lot of choice was reversed in those where people have too few possibility , not only their life to improve , but also it 's not just their life to improve but also .
This is what economists call a paretian improvement .
A redistribution of income redistribution for all the poor -- not only to poor -- because of this choice in excess that it 's going to us .
So , in the conclusion , " You can become all what you want , "
You know , people in culture , you think , " What does that fish ? "
" It 's obvious that you can 't make anything in a wind box . "
" A castrateful , a world that 's limited vision --
and I 've been interpreted that , at the beginning .
But then , I think , instead , I realized that that that fish knows the long .
Because the reality of the fact is that if you miss into the boils , so that " all you can 't do freedom . "
If you break the boundaries that all we can decrease satisfaction .
You can get the paralisis , and you 're going to reduce the well-being .
Everybody needs a sphere .
This is almost certainly too closely , maybe even to the fish , and certainly for us .
But the absence of a little symmmentioned , the receptable , I 'm afraid of the druine .
Thank you very much of heart .
