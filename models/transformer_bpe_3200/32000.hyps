Last year I showed these slides to demonstrate that the screpair that the glacial calotter , which for almost three million years had the size of 48 million years of the size of 48 percent .
However , this subvalue the problem because it doesn 't show the spaces of the ice .
The arctic glacial calotter is , in a sense , the clear of the global climate system .
It 's expanded and you get ritigen on the summer .
The next slide is going to be a rapid carried on the last 25 years .
The glacks are in red in red .
You see , they expand to the blue wall .
That 's the ice in the winter , which is retreated as an summer .
You can see that the so-called ice , five years or more , is , as a blood , which is like blood , which here was from the body .
It 's been over 25 years , so ,
This is a problem because heat the stage of the glacier around the ocean where there are enormous amount of carbon congelated carbon congelated that , the leaves , they 're transformed into the microbes .
It turns out that the totality of the atmosphold of global warming , that amount could doubt , overcome this point of not return .
In some deep deep in Alaska metane , is already rebold of the water .
The professor Katey Walter of Alaska University of Alaska team , a team in the winter ,
Video : Wow ! Al Gore : Wow ! Al Gore : if we 're going to be it .
A reason is that this termicity climbing the Groenland from the north .
This is a Gume in the scream .
The brought was never reached similar .
This is the Kangerlussuaq , in the southwest of Groenland .
If you want to know how the sea level for the sea level of the sea on the terraferm , here is where the sea .
These currents are increasing quickly .
Anowhere the planet is the world 's biggest block of the planet .
The last month scientist , they 've been dechieve that the paper of ice is in the negative , and that the Antarctica , which is very quickly to some islands , is particularly quickly in the melt .
This is six feet of the bottom , like in Groenland .
Sulla Himalaya , the third largely block of ice , you see new laghi , which few years ago , they were glaciers .
40 percent of the world population will get half of the water that 's going to be able to the leavails .
Sulle Ande : this glacier is the source of the potability of this city .
The brought is increased .
But when they diminuight , the same happens to the water .
In California , the newnow on Sierra Nevada is 40 percent .
The idricuum are in crisis .
The predictions , like you 've read , they 're good .
The growing ss in the world leads to a remarkable increases .
The environmental disaster disaster , and it 's a rhythm and without precedented .
Four times more numer-year-old numbers than the precedented 75 .
This is a whole thing that is unsustainable .
If you look at it in the context of the context .
We 've add 70 million tons of CO2 , every 24 hours -- 25 million tons of a 24 hours -- 25 million tons of a day .
Look at the East Pacific area , from the Americas , as well as well , and on both parts of the subcontinent of Indian obx-continent , where there is a roots oxygen in the ocean .
The major causes global warming , together to deforestation , which is 20 percent , is the use of fossil fuel fuel fuel .
The oil is a problem , and the carbon is even worse .
The United States is one of the two more emissions , together to China .
And it was proposing to build a lot of other carbon .
But we 're seeing a direction changes .
These are the anullated projects in the last few years and some green alternative of the green .
Anyway , there 's a very politics in our country .
The carbon industry and oil industry have spent 250 million dollars in the last year to promote carbon , which is a oxide .
That 's just remembered me me of something --
Natal Tennessee , in Tennessee , where I live , I live , there was 3.8 billion ligloss of carbon .
Maybe you 've seen it on the news .
This is the second largest flow of flowing in America .
It happened around Natal .
The publicity of one of the carbon industry was this .
Video : Spy the carbon is a very allegggggrid and happy .
It 's abundant here in America , and it 's growing our economy .
Frosty the carbon is always clean .
It 's good price , adorable and the work , and the workers keep the stypde .
Al Gore : From here is a lot of the West Virginia .
The biggest mineral society on the mountains is Massey Coal . This is his administrator .
Video : Don Blankenship : I 'm going to have clear -- Al Gore , Nancy Pelic , Harry Reid -- they don 't know what they 're talking about .
Al Gore : So the Alleance for the Clima has launched two campaign .
This is a part of them .
Video : Acore : Acore COLergy , we see climate change as a sery several deal with our business .
So our priority is to invest a lot of money in a effort to make public and confused to make public and confused the truth of the carbon .
In fact , carbon is not sports .
We think it 's clean -- it 's also a good profum .
So , not pitch of climate change .
Let me do it .
Video : Carbone : Carbone -- you 've heard a lot of it .
So we have a turn into a structure that 's a hand-up structure to the hot coal .
Straordinary ! The machines are a little rumor , but this is the sound of the carbon technology .
The coal consumption is between the main causes of warming , but the remarkable technology that you see changes everything .
You look at a look : this is the hodiergain technology of clean .
Al Gore : Finally , the positive alternative positive is to the economic issue and the national security .
Video : LAmerica is in crisis ; the economy , the national security , climate crisis .
The physicians that connects all : our dependence from fossil fuel , like carbon path and oil practice and oil imported .
Now , there 's a new , audace solution to use it .
Repower : 100 percent clean energy , in 10 years .
A plan to put America to work , make us sure more secure , and help us secustststage .
Finally , a solution that behind our problems .
Repower . Scoprite more .
Al Gore : This is the last .
Video : How to reach energy to America .
One of the faster ways to the dependence of the combustible that we 've got to kill our planet .
Compars : The future is here . Very , a new energy network .
Compars number two : Negegetables for a very well retribed jobs .
Death America . It 's time to be realists .
Al Gore : A African proverbio 's say , " If you want to go fast , go to fast .
If you want to go away , go together . "
We have to go away , quickly .
Thank you very much .
Last year we have a Ten introduction on the LHC .
And promise to return to fix it to go back to how the machine works .
So here I am . And for the ones that other time , there were no , LHC is the biggest scientific experiment ever attempted -- 27 kilometers of circumstan-and-circumstan-and-circumstands .
His task is to rereflare the conditions that were at least than a billion of the universe -- to 600 million times a second .
All of that is just ambitious .
This is the machine in Genra .
We have this min-Big Bang Bang 's relevant .
This is what I work . It 's called ATLAS -- is about 44 meters and has a diameter diameter of 22 meters .
This is a spectacular picture of ATLAS in built building so you can see proportions .
Ten september last year we took the machine for the first time .
And this picture was taken by ATLAS .
It was because of immense festeggments in control room .
It 's a picture of the first particles that had made all the movement of the LHC , entering hillness , deliberately , with a part of the LHC , and spread particles inside the detector .
In other words , when we saw that that 's 10 september , we realize that machine was a great wictory .
I don 't know if it was this to exultate more or this , when somebody went on on Google and saw the pagage was this .
That means we have had a cultural impact beyond to the scientific .
About a week later , there was a problem with the machine , had to these slums here -- these sleeps here -- these sleep .
These flare 13,000 pockroach when the machine works on the massive of power .
Now , the technicians will look at the files and say , " It 's not true . I 'm very suctiles too overwhelmed . "
And they can do it because when they 're very cosidds of becomes cosidds .
So , at least 271 degrees , at least 271 degrees on the space between stars , these bles can bring that current .
In one of the giunture of the most of the novehicle in the HC , there was a defect of a factory .
So the files , they surprise slightly , and the 13,000 pound improvised an electrical resistance .
This was the result .
Now , this is even more impressive if you think that these fish more than 20 tons , and you have moved in about 30 inthrats .
They 're sitting in 50 magnnnets .
We had to take them , what we did .
We 've been rested and upon them .
They are now coming back all the subland to their place underground .
By the end of the LHC is going to be again .
We 're going to access it , and we expect to get to judge or lude , and we keep so our adventure to discover what are the morning on the moron that we 're going to be the universe .
Now , of course , these accidents reach the debate on the value of science and engineering in front of science and engineering in front . It 's easy to be . It 's easy to conffuture .
I think the fact that 's so hard , the fact that it 's so hard to go beyond the value of things like LHC .
I would like to end with the words of a scientist scientist , Humphrey Davy , which , I suppose , in difense of the unuseful experiments of his bulllo , his pulle was Michael Faraday , said , " Nient is so much dangerous to the human mind of science are definitive , which our triumph-defined , that our triumph-definiters , that our triumph-supped triual . "
Thank you .
I want to start asking you to rethink about when you , as kids , you play with kids with the morning .
While you understand how you get to get them and deal , get them and get them , and you actually move them , learn to think and solve problems with space relationships .
The space reasoning is deeply connected to the way we understand a lot of the world around us .
So , as a computer computer computer classicians , with physical objects , together to my consultant objects , with my consultant objects , I started to ask myself , " And if , when we use a computer , I started asking , " And if we use a computer , instead of having the mouse as digital pollyer that moves on a desktop , we could deal with both hands , we could deal with both both hands , with both your hands ,
and how do it to our pleasure ?
The question was so interesting we decided to explore the answer , building Siftable .
In a few words , a Siftable computer is a big interactive computer as a discovered biomist .
In a few words , a Siftable computer is a big interactive computer as a discovered biomist .
You can move with them , they can , " see " between them , they can , feel their movement and they have a screen and a radio wireless .
But most usbed , they 're physical objects , like the morning , you can just be deal with it .
The Siftable is the example of a new ecosystem of tools to manipulate digital information .
And as they become more physical , achieves , the other , and as well , as well , as well , as they become more physical , the other way , how they die them , we can explore new and fun and fun and fun of interaction .
I 'm going to start with some simple example .
This Siftable is configured to show video : if you put it into a direction , video rotates that will rotate it into a direction , video rotate .
These interactive portraits of other active portraits .
If you rco , they 're interested in what they 're around .
If they come around , they can see it and they can do it a little bit .
If they come around , they can see it and they can do it a little bit .
They also have their movement and inclination .
We then realized that one of the most implications of the interaction was able to use the common data , for example , " a color as if it 's a liquid .
In this case , we have three Siftable configured as a bucks and I can use them to fix the color in the central , where you get mix .
and I can use them to fix the color in the central , where they get .
We can be too much , we can put a little bit a place .
There are also beautiful possibilities of learning , like language , language , mathematics , and logifts where people can try to try things very quickly , and see the results of the immediately .
I 'm now --
This is a Fibonaccount that I do with a program of equations .
Here we have a words that 's in the middle of Scarabean and Boble .
Pratically , at every turnal , you get a letter at all Siftable , Pratically , to every turnal turnal at any Siftable , and as you try and figure out what the control of a dictionary .
Then , after about 30 seconds remisses , and you have a new lecklie and new possibilities to try .
Thank you .
Here 's the children came to the Media Lab , I did so I tried them and I took a video .
They are very pleased .
And one of the interesting things like this kind of appliance of this is that you don 't have to give people a lot of education .
You just say , " Compon words , and they know exactly what to do .
Here 's the people who try it .
This is our younger tester 's younger , there 's the most young , right .
It was actually wanted to impild them .
They were only broncles , for him .
Now , this is a appliance of a interactive cartoon .
We wanted to build a tool for the learning of Lui is Felix .
It can put characters in the scene , by lifting the Siftable .
It can put characters in the scene , by lifting the Siftable .
So , it 's going to get the sun .
Video : The sun is sun .
David Merrill : Now , has led a hold hold in the scene .
Video : Healange hold .
Bel work ! Yeah !
So , the Siftable and put them close to interact with character characters --
Video : Bau !
... by inventing their story .
Video : Hey !
DM : It 's a story with the open , and it can decide him like it 's going to be .
DM : It 's a story with the open , and it can decide him like it 's going to be .
Video : From , y-shake .
DM : The last example I have time to show you a tool , is made of recent , to samamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamampioning ,
It 's a tool , recently , to tramamamamamamampioning and exect-music .
The Siftable here , the bass and the bacteria .
Each of these has four different variations , and you can choose what to use .
You can also put these sound in a sequence to get to your pleasure .
And you just do it by doing it by doing a sweet and a sequence .
These are actually going to be able to live , like reverbing and the filter .
You know , it 's going to be particularly and then inclens for them .
And then there are the general effects like time and volume , which is applied to sequence .
Let 's look at how it works .
Video : We 're going to start putting a base in two Siftable sequence , we 're going to go to a series , we 're add to the other base .
Now I put a line of the bottom line .
Video : DM : I add of percussions --
Video : I 'll put the bacteria , so I can now put the effect from the alive .
Video : I can be able to be able to share the whole sequence time on the side of the other .
Video : I 'm going to add the bottom to give more expression .
Video : I can recombine the sequence of the flying .
So I don 't have to plan it before , but I can improvisit , and it 's a longer or shit .
And now , finally , I can spend the whole sequence on the left Siftable . The Siftable .
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is to build new mo-machine interfaces and more sumptions how our brain work and body .
And today , I 've had time to show you one of the results of this path , and also some chance we try to bring out of the lab .
The concept I want to transmitted you is that 's coming to this new generation of objects to interact with digital media , which will lead to information in our world that we want .
Thank you very much .
I don 't see the time to talk to all of you .
I 'm a writer .
I 'm going to be a profession , but it 's more than that , obviously .
It 's also love and the fascination of my life .
And I don 't expect that it can change .
But , I said , something particularly happened in my life and my career , which brought me to get the whole whole relationship with this work .
The particular thing is I recently written this book , this biography called " Mangia , Prega , Ama , " Ama , " which , diversally from my precedented in the world and became a big , bestseller , interational bestseller ,
And the result is that everywhere is going to be , people treat me as if I was convicted .
It 's true -- you convicted , convicted !
They 're all about me , all the worry and they say , " You don 't afraid to do it better ?
Do you keep writing for all life without being able to create a book that can be able to create a book that can important thing ? "
that can be importantly to someone ? "
It 's surance , you know .
But it could go worse , part of that I remember that over 20 years ago , when I started to say , I started to say , I was a writer -- I wanted to be a writer .
I was going to meet the same reaction that was based on the fear .
And people would say , " Don 't I could have success ?
Do you know , you know , the humiliation of refved killed you ?
Do you feel that you 've got to do this windoor for all life without anything to come out and dying on a cumulation of the block of the bits of love with the bits of love with the bags ? "
So , you know .
The answer -- the short answer to all of these questions is , " Yeah . "
Yeah , I 'm afraid of all those things .
I 've always had fear .
And I also have fear of many other things that people can 't guess .
As the algae and other things .
But , as I writing what I thought and I asked me , I asked myself , is why ?
Is it rational ?
It 's logical that anybody who has to be spented by a job that you feel like to do .
But what is so specifically in the creative impress that makes us nervous health mental health care of the health care of the other careers don 't .
How my father , for example , he was a chemist engineer and I don 't remember one time in his 40 years of activity that was asked if he was afraid he was asked if he was afraid to be engineer ?
There was never -- that block of engineer John , how do it ?
It didn 't work so , you know ?
Onestly , chemical engineers like group have no matter , in the centuries , waraded the reputation of being alcozed manipulated depressive .
We have a writers , we have enough this reputation , and not just writers , but creativity of all kinds of instable .
And it 's not to look at the trillion of the deaths of magnifetic magnifeth of the green century , they die young and often to them .
And also the ones that don 't suicide look like to be really disfaced by their dunes .
Nman Mailer , before he died , in the last interview said , " Every little bit of a little more " an extraordinary affermation about the work of their life .
But we don 't bat when we feel that we 've heard these things so long that somehow we 've completely interiorized and accepted the notion that creativity and suffering the notion that creativity and the art , at the end , it will always be a little bit of tightly tired and the art , and then it will always always the bottom .
And the question I want to take all of today is : are you agree with this idea ?
It 's good , because even starting it from a centimeter of distance to me , it 's not good for this supposition .
I think it 's hate .
And I think it 's dangerous and I don 't want to see the perpetuated in the next century .
I think it 's better to encourage our big creative minds to live .
And I certainly know that , in my case -- in my situation -- it would be very dangerous to start fixing towards that supplies of supposed to smooth circumstances that I 'm in my career .
It 's really -- you look at it , they 're pretty young , I have about 40 years .
I still have about four work decades of work in me .
And it 's very likely that whatever I write in the world , and then it 's going to be judged by the world as the work that I did my last book .
I 'm going to be slaveeweless , because we 're all more , I 'm likely that my big success is to my shoulder .
Oh , Gesus , who thought !
You know , this is the kind of thought that leads a person to start to drink in the morning , and I don 't want to do it .
I would keep doing this work that we love .
So , the question becomes , what ?
And so , I think , after a lot of reflection , which the way to keep writing is to create a psychological construction , OK ?
I have to find a safety of security between me , I 'm writing , I 'm writing , and my natural anxiety about which reaction will be able to get . And , I was trying to try and find other society to see if they could have some better ideas and look at the time , trying to find other society to see if they could have more and more healthy , and more healthy healthy and look at the time ,
about how to help the creative people to run the inerent risks of creativity .
And that research took me to the ancient Grek and ancient Rome .
I 'm going to go because I 'm going to go back .
In the ancient Greek and the people don 't seem to believe that creativity came from men , OK ?
And it was thinking about creativity was this spirit watch the men from a few distant and unknown , for distant distant and unknown , for distant distant and unknown , for distant and unknown .
The Great 's called these revolins of spirits and the cretivity " demand . "
Socrate , wonder , he believed to have a helped that elargness wisdom that was away .
The Rooms were the same idea , but they called that species of spirit without a genius .
That 's great , because Roands didn 't think that a genius was particularly smart .
They had to be this genius was this kind of divine entity , which was literally belief in the walls of an artist 's study , a little bit like the elpho Dobby , and that they were out to be hidden the job of the artist and models the result of that work .
Here 's what 's the distance -- that 's the distance of which I talk about -- that psychological construction that protected you from your work .
And everybody knew that was how it worked , right ?
So , the antiks were protected to be things , like , for example , too much , for example , too much , not ?
If your work was exceptional job you couldn 't take all the place , all of the deserve , all of you know that you 've been helped by this incorporate genius .
If your work failure , it wasn 't your whole , right ?
And everybody knew that 's your genius to be an unable .
And so people , conceived creativity in the West for a long time .
And then the Renciment came and all changed , and it changed this big idea ; we put the human being over the universe over the universe over the universe over and the mysteries and without leave space creatures that they write by divinity .
This was the principle of the rational humanity and people started thinking about creativity came out of the individe .
And for the first time in history , he started to refer to this or artist as a genius that person with a genius that person with genius .
And I have to say , I think it was a big mistake .
I think I allow someone , a simple person to believe that they 're like a recipient ssource , the source of all the mysteries , creativity , unknown , unknown , unknown , unknown , unknown and ethern is a very big file to give to the human psyches .
It 's like to ask someone to enjoy the sun .
Deform and I 'm totally going to be the ego and creates all these inexectations on performance .
And I think it was this pressure that I was made to be about 500 years old .
And , if this is true , and I think that 's , the question becomes , and now ?
Can we do that ?
Maybe you can go back to a more comprehension of human relationship and human mystery .
Or maybe not .
Maybe we can 't cell 500 years of rational thinking in a 18 minutes .
And there 's probably people in the audience that would have a legitimate scientific , on the notion of , they do , they do that follows people are spending the next faced of their projects .
I 'm going to be not convinced you all about this thing .
But the question I would like to ask is -- why not ?
Why don 't you think that in this way ?
Because it 's more sense of everything that has ever heard to explain the exasperant imprevebility of the process creative process .
A process that , as anybody who ever attempted to do something -- so , basically , everybody here -- you know , you know , you don 't get rationally .
And , in fact , it can sometimes seem completely like paranormal .
I did this meeting recently meeting Stone , Ruth Stone , who has now 90 years , but that was a poetime for all life and said that during her infant in the rural ral Virginia , and he felt , in if a poem at , when a poem was going to be in the landscape .
He said that was like a fragorous air train .
And that was rotating to her from the landscape .
He felt that , because he was going to be tremendous , because he was going to be under their feet .
He knew that he had one thing to do at that point and was of , words , " running like a match . "
And so it 's going to go home and come to this poem , and it would not have to get a piece of paper and a match and a match of a pretty quickly , as the trapse and grade it on the page .
Over three times he couldn 't be fast enough , so it would be so fast and running without having to go home and he would keep them in home and she loved it and she would continue to round through the landscape , looking for , as she said , " another poet . "
And then there were those times -- this piece of time , I 'm going to never forget -- there were almost losing , OK , OK ?
So , he was running home and she was trying to try and searching her through , and she was looking at the time that was going , and then he was going to go and then said , that it was like if you were alone with the other hand and the coffee .
He was going to go to the poem from the tail and he would put it into his body and transcent on the page .
And in these cases , the poem would be , and the way , the way , the last word to the last word .
So when I thought I was crazy , I was crazy , it 's exactly the same thing that I made .
Not all my creative process -- I 'm not a conviction !
I 'm a mule , and my way to work is ; I 'm waiting for me to get up at the same horary every day and play it turns out .
But even I , in my headline , I 've been brought against that , sometimes .
And I guess that many of you have done it .
You know , even if the work and ideas came to me from a certain source , you can 't honest it .
And what is this thing ?
And how can we relate it so that we don 't have lose your head , but , rather , what do you do you have to hold it ?
As I 'm about , the best example of the contemporary example I have is the musician Tom Waits , which I 've interviewed several years ago for a newspaper .
We were talking about this , and you know , Tom , for the majority of life has been the incarnation of the incarnation of the towards , to control , domining these species of impulses .
But then he gave , he calculus , and one day as he was driving on a highway to Los Angeles , changed all over him .
He was going to fast and everything with this little bit of melody , which is in his head as the inspiration , and it 's going to be in his head as the inspiration , and the desider , and the desidst , but it 's really not about how to take it .
It 's not a piece of paper , it has no matched , it has no register .
So I started to hear this species of old anxiety growing up in him , " I 'm going to lose , and I 'm going to hold it .
I 'm not good enough and I can 't do it . "
And instead of going to go to the panic , and he stops .
He lived the whole mental process and made something completely new .
He just looked at the sky and said , " Scushed , I 'm driving ? "
" You know , it 's going to write a song now ?
If you really want to existing , you get back to a more opporting time when I can take care of you .
Or , I wish to importess someone else today .
You know , to disturbing Leonard Cohen . "
And his process changed after this .
Not the work , the work , it was still dark .
But the process , and the fish anxiety that was remained when the genius , the genius that was out of him , and the genius that was the genius that was going to be , and then remains it back from where it was , realized that it didn 't have to be a thing and handed .
but you can do this peculiar , wonderful bizarre collaboration between Tom and this strange and outside that it was not Tom .
So , how I felt that story started to change a little bit even the way I worked and I had a lot of saving me .
This idea , I was saved when I was wrwing " Mangia , Prega , Ama , and fall in one of those cave disperation where we 're causing it and we don 't start to do it and you can 't start thinking that 's going to be a disaster , which is going to be the worst book .
Not just bad , right , the worst book written .
And I started to think about throw this project .
But then I remembered to me of Tom who was talking to the air and I tried .
So I went up my face on the gypitch and I was made my commenter and revenue my face ,
And I said , " Hey , what , you know , what , you 're going to be , we know that if this book is not going to be brilliant , no ?
Because I 'm putting all of what I have , I don 't have any more than that .
So if you want to be better , you have to introduce you and do your side .
OK . But if you don 't do it , you know what , I don 't do it .
I 'm going to write the same because it 's my work .
And I would like to be a favor that was recorded I took to do my part , " Because -- at the end is so , OK -- I was like , OK -- I was doing in the deserts of the dances of the sunk , dances and sgives that they would go on and sacred to the dank-to-foreign Africa , and sacred to the dance .
And they were always magnify , because the ballerins were professional and they were great .
But every time , rarely , something happened , and one of these artists became transforming .
And I know what I 'm talking about , because I know you 've all seen , at a certain point , a performance so .
It was like if the time stops , and the dancer walked through a kind of land-up and was not doing anything different from the usual , as 1,000 notes before , but all would fall .
And suddenly , it doesn 't seem just like a human human .
But he 's accese from the divinity of divinity .
And when this happened , when they were , people knew what was , they called it .
They had their hands and began to sing , " Allah , Allah , Allah , God , " God , " God , "
That 's God , you know .
Jurious note -- when the Mori invases the south of Spain , I took this habitude with them and the pronounce changed in the centuries from " Allah , Allah , Allah , Allah , " in the flams or in the flames or in flames .
In Spain , when a artist did something impossible and magic , " Allah , " Allah , " By , " incomprehensive , bespeaked , et-up , et-up , I 'm going to go .
And it 's great because we need it .
But , the problem comes the dancer , for the dancer , when you wake up and discover that are 11 in the morning of Martedesday and the last last of God .
It 's just a big bad bad ginches , and maybe it 's not going to get that altitude more to make that altitude .
And maybe nobody will save the name of God , and what does it have to do with the rest of his life ?
It 's hard .
This is one of the most paorous recogniliations to do in creative life .
But maybe it doesn 't have to be so much have to be so much if you can 't believe , mostly , that the most extraordinary aspects of your being come from yourself .
But you would just believe that you 're going to be a unimaginable source of this team that 's a little bit of a life that you have to go on somebody else when you finished .
And , you know , if we think it 's all changes .
And so I started thinking about it , and it 's certainly how I thought I 've thought about several months during the work of the book that I 'm going to give it on , the dangerous , attesissues , followed the my great success .
And what I have to keep telling me when I feel electric .
It 's not just your work . It 's just your work .
It 's a little bit of a talk about your side , any can be .
If your work is dancing , you ball .
If the divine , absurd genius to take a few kinds of wonderful , for a moment through your effort , for one moment through your effort , then " Ole ! "
Otherwise , you do the same your dance .
And " Ole ! " You know the same .
I think and I think I should teach it .
" Ole ! " You know , just for having human and wildlife and testing tale tale of the tal tale of the tale of the tal tale of them to be able to be .
Thank you .
Thank you .
June Cohen : Ole !
As you know I 've talked about some of these projects on human genome , what it can mean and the discovery of new set of genes .
We 're now starting a new path : we started to digitalize biology and now we started to digital code we 're coming into a new phase of biology , designing and synthesizing and designing and synthesizing life .
We 've always been trying to bring big questions .
" What is life ? " is something that many biologists think have tried to understand vararise .
We tried different processes , reduced it to the minimum terms .
We 're type of digitializing for almost 20 years .
When we sequenced the human genome was to spend from analome of the biology world 's the digital world .
Now we ask us : Can we regenerate life , or create new life from this digital universe ?
This is the map of a little organism , Mycoplasma genitalium , which is the species from the smallest genome between those that can authorean genome .
And we tried to reduce the genome to create a little bit more .
We can eliminate a hundred genes of genes about 500 than over here .
But when we take a look at his metabolic map , it 's relatively simple as our .
I think , that 's simple .
But when we look at all the genes that we can eliminate , one at the time , it 's very unlikely that this can bring to a living cells .
So we decided that the only way to progree to be synthize this chromosome way that could change the components to bring some of these fundamental questions .
And so we started the adventure of " Can we can synthize a chromosome ? "
Can we have chemistry to make these big molecules that we never have been able to create these big molecules that we never have been able to create before ?
And , in case , we can make a chromosome ?
A chromosome is just a piece of chemical material chemical material .
The speed we 're able to digitize life is growing up to exponential life is growing to recival .
Our ability to write the genetic code , instead , progree , it 's pretty slowly , but it 's better .
And our most recent results the exponential curve .
We started over 15 years ago .
The process required many passages , starting with a bioethical revension , first experiments .
But we found that synthesize DNA is very hard .
There are tens of thousands of cars in the world that make little segments of DNA , long , long , and it 's a process : the segments of the world , more than the segment is long , more than the mistakes are .
We had to develop a new method to assemble these fragments and correcrect the mistakes .
And this was our first attempt , starting to go from the digital genome of the genome of the genome of the genome of the genome of the genome of the genome of the genome of the genome of the genome of the genome of the Genome of the genome of the G
It 's a little virus that kills bacteria .
We designed the fragments , effectured the correction of the mistakes and get a molecule of about 5,000 letters .
The interesting part is when we took this piece of chemical material , and we put it in bacteria , the bacteria have started to read this genetic code and viral particles .
The viral particles have been released by cells , they went back and they 've been destroyed .
I 've been talking about recent with oil industry telling us that they have certainly compressed this model .
They have reward more than you .
We think this is a situation where software can actually build its same hardware in a biology system .
But we wanted to do things larger .
We wanted to build the whole chromosome of bacteria .
I 'm over 580 mile genetic code .
So we thought we made it in the casses of the size of the viruses , so that we can change the cassets to understand what are the components of a living cells .
The design is crucial , and if we start with digital information in a computer , they have to be very accurate .
When we sequenced this genome for the first time in 1995 accuractivity was a mistake for every 10 thousands .
We found it , we would resequence it , 30 mistakes . If we had that original sequence that original sequence would never be able to do it work .
One part of the process is to design 50 letters that overlaunch with all the other 50 letters that overlawns to build subunits to build subunits that they 're working together .
We try and unique elements here .
You probably read that we 've read that we put in the river .
Think about this : we have a genetic code on four letters : A , C , Gs and T.
Three of those letters put together with about 20 ad-amminomins , and there 's a specific order to letters for every friminominominominomins .
So we can use the genetic code to write words , frash , thinking .
What we did we do at the beginning was autographed .
Some have been dollar that wasn 't poem .
We designed these segments to just join them by just joke them together with enzymes .
There are entertaining them and put them on them .
And we started assembled with the segments , starting with segments from five to seven thousands , unending , unending up to 24 thousands of 24 thousands of milddenly thousands of letters .
At every step we made these segments in abundance , so that we 're trying to make an extremely road processing -- as you see in a minute .
We 're trying to author the process .
So , this seems to be a basket played .
When we get these very long , over the most of 100 thousands , low-lower , they will not grow more directly in E.
It 's to the modern tools of molecular biology .
So we 've been considered other mechanisms .
We knew about another mechanism called a homologa , called homologa , which is using biology is used to go out the DNA to join the DNA to join .
Here 's one example .
This organism , called Deinococcus radiodurans , can absorbs three million radiation .
You can see in the superior as his chromosome as his chromosome .
In 12 -- 24 hours , it 's been assembled exactly as it was before .
There are thousands of organisms that they can do it .
These organisms can sit completely .
They can live under empty .
They 're absolutely that life existing in space , and you feel to find new environments of water .
ASA showed up , NASA showed that this is .
This is a picture of the molecule we built using these processes , just using these processes , just using the segments to put on the segments to put .
The lights assemble the automatically .
This is not taken with a microscope electronic microscope , but with a microscope .
It 's a molecule that we can see it with a light microscope .
These are photos that cover a period of about six seconds .
This is the puzzled that we 've done a little time ago .
They 're over 580,000 letters of genetic code .
It 's the largest molecule of a defined structure that man .
It 's got a 300 million molecular fish at 300 million .
If you stay it with a 10 without spaces , you would take 142 pages only to transcratch this genetic code .
Now , how do we do it work ? How can we do it to do that ?
Of course , you 're going to be a game from kids .
It 's a little bit more complicated when you use bacteria .
It 's easier as well as it 's eucariote cells like our our : you can just extract nucleus and put it on another , which is basically the process of cloning .
In the archaea bacteria the chromosome is integrated inside the cell , but we recently demonstrated that we 're able to do a complete trading of a chromosome from another and to activate it .
We clear a chromosome starting with a microbial species .
The two are different as men from the mouse .
We have added some gene more so that we can decide what to this chromosome .
And then , I 'm sitting with the enzymes , so you know ,
And when we put it in the cells was amazing -- and you 'll open our sophisticatomic graphic graphic graphic graphic graphic graphic graphic graphic graphic graphic graphic graphic graphic graphic graphic graphic graphic graphic graphic graphic graphic graphic grap
And we started thinking we couldn 't go beyond , but we tried so anymore in there .
This is one of the major mechanisms of evolution .
We found that a lot of anti-species , they 've added a second or chromosome , added in a second thousand tracks in a second thousand tracts in a second thousands of new tracts to that species .
So who thinks about evolution as a only gene , at the time that has not understood a lot of biology .
There are some enzyme called " restressing " that they 're going to type DNA .
The chromosome that was in the cells , you can 't have one .
The cell phone chromosome that we have insert -- it 's got it .
It 's expressed , and it recognized the other chromosome as exrange , and it 's got it , and we found it with only the cell and the new chromosome .
It 's become blue because of the genes we 've put .
And in a short leverse of time , all the characteristics of a species , went lost , and it turned around in a new species , based on the new software that we 've put in the cells .
All the proacts have changed , the membranes have changed , and when we read the genetic code is exactly to what we 've transfer .
Now , this might seem to look like genetic alchemy , but altering the software way .
Now , I 've explained that you don 't talk about genesis -- but to progress from three million years and a half million years of evolution , and I said that maybe we 're going to create a new version of Cambrian explosion where we 're going to create new species on this digital process .
Why do that ?
I think it 's pretty obvious when we think about our needs .
We 're going to go from six and a half billion people in the next 40 years .
Just to give an example : I 'm born in 1946 .
There are three people on the planet for each existing in 1946 , in 40 years , there will be four .
We 're having problems now to find food , fresh water and clean , medicine and blind for six and a half billion people .
It 's going to be more hard to do it for nine billion .
We use more than five billion carbon , we 're 30 billion barium barium , over 30 billion baries .
That means a million barium means million baries a day .
When we try to find biological processes , or any kind of process to replace , it will be a huge challenge .
We have to be in more , we have to hold the emission of CO2 from these materials that fits into the atmosphere .
At day , thank you very much scientific discovery that we have a database with about 20 million genes , and I like to think they are the designed components for the future .
The electronic industry has only a dozen about components , and think about how many different things are coming out .
Our limitations are principle of the biological and our imagination .
We now have techniques , thods of the rapid synthesization , we can create what we call combinatory genomics .
We can build a big robot that can produce a million chromosomes a day .
Think about these 20 million genes or different genes or to prove the processes to prove the processes to produce eight-up or drugs , new vaccines , we can change , because of a small team , and create more biology molecular biology now that in the last 20 years of science .
And it 's just a standard selection .
We can choose to survival , chemical production or carbon , production , or wild vaccines .
This is an instanteny-software instantly that we 're working on to be able to be able to seats us and design species to the computer .
Well , we don 't necessarily know how they will be .
We know exactly their genetic code .
We 're now focusing on the fourth of the fourth generation .
You 've also seen that extract from grant was a finished experiment .
We have covers of second and third generation that will be done enough from sugar to the sugar of higher value as the eight-different kinds of butanol .
But the only way biology can have a big impact without increasing more increasing the cost of food and limitarly the cost of the food and limitaren the cost of the first , so we 're working on design cells that can achieve this purpose , and we think we can have the first carbon in the last quarter generation in about 18 months .
The solar light with CO2 is a metodo-do--- but in our discovery different discovery .
This is a organism that we described in 1996 .
He lives in the deep ocean , about 2,500 meters of the deep sea temperature of the water temperature .
They create a molecular hydrogen molecular as a source of energy source .
We 're trying to figure out if we can sent CO2 , which can easily be transported through tubes , converting that CO2 carbon , to drive this process .
So , a little bit of think we could be able to increasing what the basic question of " what life is , " We , greater , verse -- we have the modrespective of the oil oil oil oil industry .
Exactly . If you can 't do it from TED , where you can ?
It would be a main the source of energy .
And we 're working to use the same metods to create instantaneous instantane-wine vaccines .
You 've seen this year with flu , we 're always always back to a year and with a dollar , when it 's about to find the right vaccine .
I think that this can change combinable vaccines in advaccines .
So that 's how the future could start to look at the time , the evolution , now , the evolution tree , with the evolution with synthetic bacteria , archen , and finally cells .
We 're so from the improve people .
Our purpose is to do a long time to try to try and do it . Thank you very much .
First of all I 'm going to show you , the fastest possible , some fundamental technology we took the Microsoft , and we 've been on a year ago . This is Seadragon .
It 's a environment that you can interact is at the local level that you can interact with a huge amount of visual data .
Here we 're seeing a lot of gigabyte digital phoom with a kind of zoom , and continuous , for a friend of panoramic photos , and we walk the images as we want .
And it doesn 't matter how much much much much of information that we see , how big these things are these data or data ,
Most of them are digital photographs , but this is a scanning scanning from the Library of Congress , and recome comes into the gay of 300 megapile .
It 's not a difference because the only thing that 's the only thing that 's the number of pixels on your screen in your screen in any time . It 's also a very flexel architecture .
This is a book , example of data not images .
This is the Dickens . Every colonna represents a chapter .
To demonstrate that 's just just about it and not images , we can do something like that , to really really , to make a real representation of the text , not a picture .
It could be a little artificial way to read an electronic book .
Not to me .
This is a more realistic example . It 's a number of The Guardian .
Every big image is the beginning of a section .
And it gives you really pleasure and the beautiful experience to read the load version cartotoon , which is for a moltex , which is for a moltex , which is for a moltex .
We also made something with the corner of this particular number in the angle of the Ladian .
We 've created a higher resolutione-- much higher resolution of what you use in a normal advertising advertising .
If you want to see the characteristics of this automobile , you can see here .
Or other models , or even the specific techniques .
And this really demonstrates some of these ideas to eliminate the screen of space on the screen .
We hope that that means to put it up to the pop-up and other porcheries like , not to be necessarily .
Of course , the map is one of the most obvious applications for this kind of technology .
And I don 't want to lose time , if we don 't say we have contribute to give them in this field .
These are all the streets in the United States overlawwy-geospace .
So we 're going to go to something else .
This is actually now the living on the web ; you can go to see it .
It 's a project called Photosynthy , which combine two different technologies .
One is Seadragon and the other is a very interesting research computer research that was made by Noah Snavely , a student of the University of Washington , with Steve Seitz of UW Seitz and Rick Seitz Seitz 's Microsoft Rick Szeliski . An n n n n n n n .
And it 's from the Weadragon , and I was running .
You can see it when we do this type of skeleton , where we can go from a picture to the other and have this kind of experience to the other experience .
But the space collocation of the images here has actually a meaning .
The algorithms of the computer visualization have been recorded these images together , so that they correspond to the real places that I 've seen -- all skept close to the Roccious sson Montagne Rockpic . They have been taken . Here you see the elements of a slide , and these things have been all linked up .
I don 't know if I have time to show you some other environment .
There are a lot more space .
I want to go directly to one of the original data of Noah-- and this is from a previous prototype of Photosynth-prototype of Photosynthy , which is really the key key to the early extreme that we have been doing is really the key to the world that we put in the website .
We had to worry about legal aspects and so on .
This is a reconstruction of Notre Dame images in Notre Dame images in Flickr . Basta digites , Do Flickr and you get pictures of the sorts , other than the campus and so on . Oach one of these hanange orange ories , it 's discovered to this model .
So they 're all images by Flickr and they have been connected to this way .
And it 's possible to be able to be so simple ,
You know , I would never have thought to end up for Microsoft .
It 's very gratificent to get this kind of accovery here .
I think you can see that it 's a lot of different types of photos , and those of the mobile phones to the SLR professional , meaning-protection , put together in this environment .
And if I can , I try to look at those strange .
A lot of them are caught by faces , etc .
Some of the side here you find a series of photographs -- I 'm going to be a series of photographs --
This is a Notre Dame Dame Dame Dame Dame Dame .
We can go from poster to the physics of this environment .
The essential point is that we can do things with social environment . This is now taking data from the whole whole memory of the interal memory of how to appear to be , from visual memory -- and connects all those data together .
All those pictures become connected together , more than the sum of the parts .
You have a path of the land that emerges .
Think about this as a fabulungation of Stephen Lawler on Earth .
It 's something that grows in complexity as well as people use it , and the advantages for the use of the use of the use of the use .
Their pictures are husbed with inseries on other people .
If you get the idea of contrast all of these sants saying the name , my picture of Notre Damenter 's dral of the clubs of all those data , and I can use it as a requires to immers in that way , using it 's a picture of a kind of a kind of cross-mooth experience , and a cross-user experience of a cross-moot-out of shapes ,
Of course , a consequence of all that are virtual models extremely elaborate all of the interesting part of the Earth , they don 't just have to be an airplane and similar images and similar images and similar imagery .
Thank you .
Chris Anderson : I realized ? What your software is going to take us to do is that at a certain point , in the next few years , all of the cameras all over the entire world will be practically connected together ?
BAA : Yeah . What 's doing is basically , it 's discovered .
It 's creating hyperlink , if you want , you want to be , between images .
And it 's doing it in the base of the images .
The thing becomes very interesting if you think about wealth of semantement information that many of these images .
As you do a research research on the web , you have a phrase and the text on the web page has a lot of information about the pictures of the picture .
Now , what happens if that picture is you connect all your photos ?
So the amount of semantics and the amount of wealth that comes to be really enormous . It 's a classic effect of the network .
CA : Blaise , it 's really unbelief .
BAA : Thank you very much .
One of the main pleasure , when you travel and one of the thanks of the ethnographics is the way you have never forgotten the antic traditions , among the past wind , you have the past in the wind , the wind , the stones that are in the stones , leverts in the stones , leverts .
Basti think the scientists Jaguar travel to beyond the Via Lattea , or that the admites of the elekeeps , or that in Himalayas , the buddists are still a breath of the Dharma , to remind the central importance of anthropology , and the idea that the world we live in any sense of the anthropology , and that the world we live not solute ,
the consequence of a particular adapative choices that our estrpe has done , well or bad , many generations .
And , of course , we all share of the essential tracks .
We all procrete .
We 're subjects to begin .
We have to death the inexection of death , so we don 't surprising and we don 't surprising and we 're --
We all have a art .
What it hits is the particular rhythm of the song , the dance of every culture .
It doesn 't matter that they are the Penan forests of Borneo , or the following Vodoo 's the Curandsut , Kaisut , Kaisut , Kenya Saharsut in Kenya Sahara hert in the heart of the Sahara 's box .
He was my journey complished in the desert a month ago , or a aleyeak in IIIIIIIIIIs , the Everest , the dead of the world .
All of these populations teaching us that there are other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking ,
And , if you think , you think , it 's a concept that it can give you hope .
Insides , with the myriades of the world create a spiritual life and cultural life that happens the planet and it 's important to the well-being of the planet and it 's important to the well-being of the planet as biosphere .
And you can think about this cultural ragnoise as an ethnosphere and you can call the etnosphere , the whole sum of all the conception of all the conception , un-inspirations , inspired inspired , and the inspiration of the consciousness .
The throws is the fantastic patriage of humanity .
It 's the symbol of what we 're and what we can be as inquisitive species .
And because it was gravly consumption was very , very , very , consumed to the ethnosphere and unfortunately .
Nobody biologist , for example , would say that 50 percent of all species is on the orders of the extinction just because it 's fake , or the most apocalyptic -- in the field of biological diversity -- and you don 't even get close to the most optimistic -- that 's the most optimistic -- that 's the cultural diversity .
The index of all that is , of course , the language loss .
When you were born 6,000 languages on this planet .
A language is not just composal by a vocabulary or a series of rules .
A language is the sprace of human spirit .
It 's the half the animal world 's the animal that 's coming in the material world .
Every language is a forest of the mind , a backin , a winner , a thought , an ecosystem of spiritual possibility .
And of those 6,000 languages , as we 're sitting in Monterey , at least half the horecches are not supplies in the ears of the children .
They 're not taught to kids , which means , unless than not shapes something , which are already death .
What is the sad of being made from silence , of being , the last talk to be the last talk to the language , the way to be the wisdom of the sad , or to anticipate the promise of the children ?
This is horring , it 's been in some of the world every two weeks , every two weeks a old , a little old moves and door and door with the tomble .
And I know somebody 's going to say , " It 's not much better .
The world would not be a better place if you talk all the same language ? " Benissim , then we talk all of the yoruba . We talk about the dotstage .
We talk about kogi .
You 'll be a tract what it means is not able to talk about your language .
I would like to give you a journey through the thnosphere --
a little journey in the etnosphere to give you a assage of what we 're losing .
A lot of us forgotten that when I say , " different ways of existing , I mean , really different ways of existing .
We take for example this baby Barasana 's 's a settett-settlement , the anacond the populal slats , which creates the mid-s-sandwider s-sack-sacred sacred slats .
It 's a popular that 's not able to distinguish the color of the green because you were identified in the forest , which is the popular .
They have a strange language and a rule le le , called an exogamia language , " " examiogamia " : you have to marry a different language .
And all that has radical in the past mitological past , but the particularity is that in these expensive familiar with marriage where they are are in these or seven languages because of marriages of the mystages .
They 're just going to listen to and then they start talking .
We take one of the most interesting tribe with which I have lived , the Waorani of Ecuador North order , an incredible popular that had the first contact in 1958 .
In 1957 missionaries have tried a facting construction .
They had been taken from the high photographs that rereraw them in the front of them , and forest , forest that this population of the forest pluvial forest had never seen anything bi-dimensional dimensional dimensional .
They have collected the photos , they have spend the research of a form or a shape , and , not finding nothing , they would have been going to be the hell , and they killed the five missionaries with the gonto the lain .
But Waorani don 't just have to kill the foreign .
They were killed with them .
54 percent of the mortality was caused by themselves .
We have been smoott-generations and we found two cases of natural death and when we 've been born to know , they had admit that one of them was aged , and then they killed it .
The hunters were able to recognize the 40 steps and recognize it species .
In the early ' 80s , I had a really interesting task when my Harvard 's professor asked if I wanted to go to Harvard , if I wanted to go to Haiti to the base of the potence of Duvalier and Tonton Macodates that we had to do the fast sweet with the zomoms .
To give a sense of miraft , I should have to understand Vodd culture , and the Vodoo 's not magic .
It 's quite a complex , metapphysics of the world .
Very interesting .
If I asked you to tell you the big religions of the world , what would you say ?
Cristianism , Islam , Buddhic , Ebraism , etc .
A continent is always left out , thinking that sub-Saharan Africa doesn 't have any religious feeling . And they gain and the Vodoo 's distilside of these religious concepts in the tragic concepts in the tragic conception of slavery .
What makes the interesting voodoo is the intended up between life and death .
So , the alive are hidden .
The spirits can be invoced by the Great Acqua , they response to the rhythm of the dance of the dance of the face of the face of the face of the very short of the way that 's active .
So , the voodooists , they go to church out to talk about God .
We give them in the temple and we say God . "
And since you 're marseat , is the spirit that you drive , how can you get bad ?
So you see these incredible events : following voodoo in the state of trance that touches touches touches a rather strong demonstration demonstration of the power of the mind when it 's catalyzed in the state of extreme .
And all the people I lived the most extraordinary of the Sierra Nevada 's Kogi of Sierra Nevada 's Santa Marta , in the Santa Marta , in the Santa Marta .
It was scending of the ancient civilization that once had been living on the caraibic plays of the Colombia 's attention , the popular of the Colombia 's maxium that 's the charge that 's caraibical playing on the major of the planture .
In a continent macked , this popular continent , this popular has never been conquisted by the Spanish .
But they 're actually governed by a clero , but their formation is really extraordinary .
The young people follows are taken by three or four years , and they live on a world that 's made of buy and shadow in a world that 's made of dark and shadow into the base of the glaciers for 18 years .
Two periods of nine years of course , choices to reproduce the nine months of the current months of the user-and-a-day metaphor user-Mad .
For all this time , they get acculturate the values of their society , values that they 're predicting their prayers and only their prayer to be the cosmic balance -- or to say the balance balance .
At the term of this incredible initiation , they get suddenly , and for the first time in life , at 18 years , they see an alba . And in that moment , when the sun was the ball of the first ball , when the sun was the value of the very well as the sun as a splending meant , all that 's been learned in theory . The predict a step back and says , "
" I said , " I said , " I said ,
It 's amazing . Now it 's going to protect it . "
They 're called the major brothers , and they say that we , the minmultiple , we are the destruction of the world .
This is very important .
When we think about the Ingene populations and we invote in the Rousseau and the old story of the noble wild , which is a razer concept in its simplicity , we call Thoreau and we say that these people are closer to the Earth .
The popular Ingenes are not feeling , or feeling from the nostalgam .
There 's no space for these things in the malaric palual paluat or the wind vents of the Tibet , but thank you and the way , they 've created a mystical Earth based 't that we 've been unknown to be closer , but an untremendous intuition of the Earth can live because it 's unlight-sound unds of human consciousness .
What does it mean ?
He wants a little bit of Ande who grow up in the mountain credating that mountain is a spirit that 's going to lead his destiny , and it 's going to have a very different human being able , and will have a very different relationship with the mountain mountain that is growing up a boy of the Montana who grow up a mountain is a friendly in rock .
That 's the dimad-spirit or a mineral cuts is irrelevant .
What 's interesting is the metaphor that debes the relationship between individual and the natural world .
I grew up in the British forests in the British forests , and they were cutting to be cutting .
And that made me a human being different from my friends Kwakiutl that believe that the forests are the forests of Hukuk and the bunch of the paradise and the bal rows that are living to the extreme of the world , behind that affaccomplied me in the Hamatsa .
If you start to look at that these cultures can create different reality , you can start to understand some of them sensational discoveries . We take this plant .
I took this april to the Nodoctor Amazon the west Amazon .
Mayahuash , the most powerful substance , the most powerful substance of the chievement repertoire .
What makes it fascinating the ayahuash is not the phones of the suits of the substance , but its election . It 's made by two elements .
On the one hand , this laneous lian that 's a series of behind and harmolmed , harmoline , and slightly hallucinogenic and harmoleu-lian .
Take the only plant , you have a blumn smomoke that alterms a little bit of consciousness , but it 's measured with leaves of coffee , and it 's been called Psychotria redis .
This plant is a powerful triptamine , very similar to serotonina , dimethyltryptamine-five , methoxt-yptamine .
If you ever see Yanomami you 'll get Yanomami to the nose substance that they do from a different set of species , he 's contains .
To see that pount on the nose is a little bit like being disparated by a fucile caric fucil and land on a bunch of electricity . [ Risoning ] Don 't create a distorsion of reality ; it 's actually creates the dissolution of the reality .
I was often with my professor , Richard Evan Shultes , the man who had taken the psychical , with his discovery , with his discovery , with his discovery in the ' 30s in Mexico .
And I think my way you can 't class these tripptamines as hallucinogens because if you 're not standing to be hallucinated .
It 's possible to be just if you get assume with other chemicals that you know , the MAO .
Now it 's the beautiful : Ya-carboline that are in this lianely to be inhibors of MAO , the same kind of necessary to potential triptamines . The question is sought in a flour . The question is about 80,000 species of plants , like these people who have to find two morogically not similar , but that if you combints in this way , create a biochemical version that 's superior to the sum sum supplies ?
We use the big eupherror and the mistake , which can reveal the midst .
But if you ask the Indian , they 'll tell us , " We 're going to tell us . "
What does it mean ?
This tribes , the Cofan , has 17 variety of ayahuasks , which are nackly in the forest , and that our eyes would have come in the forest , and our eyes would come in the species .
If you ask them how they stbilize their tassonomes will tell us , " I thought , I thought , " I realize I was going to be plants , " I said , " No .
The solution is : You take 17 variety of a full stage in a night and each other will sing with a tone .
With not this laurea Harvard , but it 's much more interesting than to count them .
Now , [ applaushes the problem is that even the people of us who have been a heart popular , but somehow reduced in the writing of the history of our real world , and pass over .
In fact , 300 years , in 300 years , it 's not going to be remembered for his guerre or innovations , but rather as the one was where we stopped and we 've been acted and actively actively or accepted passively or accepted passively or accept the planet . Now the problem is not the change .
All cultures through the centuries have been involved in a dance for new lifetime .
And the problem is not technology .
The Sioux Indians have no stopped to be Sioux when they put up and they put it as well as Americans have no stopped to be in the horse and heat .
It 's not the change or technology that threatened the integrity of the thnosphere . It 's the power .
The fly flight flight .
And if you give a look at the world , you 'll discover that these are not destinated cultures that these are not destiny cultures that these are not destinated cultures that these are not destiny cultures that these are not destinated cultures that these are not destinated cultures , you 're going to be able to disappearing .
They 're living and dynamics are showing from the existence of forces that are going to go beyond their ability to adaptation .
I 'm going to be tracks in the Phathy Penan --
a popular nomad Sarawak , in Sarest Asian , a popular that lived in free to a generation , and now reduced to a generation ago , and now reduction on the servitoes , where you can see the river 's river , where you can see the river in the smooth that seems to take away Borneo Mar Cinese Meridional Meridional Mes , where the Giron Meridional Mes ligave , where you can can see the horizon illuminate ,
With the wood stves the wood stves with the subject .
Or , in the case of Yanomami , are the disease that have come with the golden of the golden .
If we move on on the mountains of Tibet , where I 'm a lot of research , you 'll see the hard flight flight flight of politics .
As you know the genocide , the physical exhibition of a popular , is convicted at the level of life , but the ethnocide , the destruction of a popular popular , not just is convicted , but it 's a part of the developing brain .
And you can 't understand the suffering of Tibet until you go from the beginning .
I 've been paid the 6,000 miles from Chengdu in Western Chengdu , I come to Lhatch with a young connection , but only come to Lhasa with a young connection , but only come to Lhasa . I realized what we 've heard about .
6,000 sacred monuments in dust and cenjoyed .
1.2 million people killed by the military Cultural Revolution .
The father of this guy was ascriticized at Panchen Lama .
That means that it 's been killed in the Chinese invasion .
His fasted with Sua Santity in Santity , in the diaspora that has led popular in Nepal .
Sua mother was impried and his colpe was being rich .
It was brought to hold age in the age of two years by hidden under his gonna because she couldn 't have live without him .
The sister , who did the same , was put in reduced reducation .
A day he was sended up a waste fascil of Mao and , for this transgression , was mit to the sevened jobs for seven years .
The Tibet 's pain 's unoveroveroveroveroveroveroverwhelmed , but the spirit of the people 's 's tent .
And finally , all the way , all the way , it reduces a choice .
We want to live in the monothist world of the monothic world of the policy of diversity ?
The big anthropologist Margaret Mead , before he said that his biggest fear was that , in our way to this advance , we 're not only going to see the whole range of human imagination reduced human imagination reduced to a limited modality of thinking , but one day we 'll wake up from a sleeping sleeping to a sleep , and we 're going to get on this loaded .
And it 's umillion of the remembering that our species is 600,000 years old .
The Neolitics Riflew , who gave us us us to subject seed us , which has made us subject to the seed of the smooth , with the prostype of the clergue , and we talk about 10,000 years ago .
The industrialized world has 300 years old .
That 's a story , it 's not suggests that we have the answers to all the challenges we have to deal with the millennia to come .
When they have these myriades of the world , they asked what it means to be human , they response with 10,000 different voices .
And it 's in these answers that we all have the chance to be what we are : a kind of consciousness , which has to make all the popular and all the gardens can fire . And there are big moments of optimism .
I took this picture on the North island of Baffin the island of Baffin , when I went to the Halalallows with Inuit , and this man , Olaya , and this man , Olaya , and he told me the wonderful story of his grandfather .
The Cananadian government has not always gentle with the Inuit 's popular , and in the ' 50s to stbilifetime , we 've asked them in colonies .
The grandfather of this man refutting to go .
The family , I teming her life , took him all the board , and all of his attitude .
You have to know that Inuit doesn 't take cold , they use it .
The pillattins in origin were made of fishes in skin .
The grandfather of this man didn 't have to be a night or the library that was suffering .
It 's sgattaiolded , it 's calculated the pantalone in the skin and defecated in their hand . When I I did I focused , they worked a moama .
It spruzed on the points of this hond on the sheet , and when it became solid , he killed a dog .
It 's got a gright , and he made a gright , with the hactic cases , made a sleep , and he 's gone on the bankboard , and it 's gone on the bags , he brought up to the hell , hit in the hell .
We want to talk about cavareeas with nothing ? [ Risate ] . And this , in different ways , [ Applausi is the symbol of the popular Inuit and all the popular people in the world .
In the april 1999 , the California government has reached the total control of an area of the largest territory of the California and Texas I put together .
It 's their new patria . It 's called Nunavut .
It 's an independent territory . They counter-and they get .
One of the splendication of how a nation-state can recognize with his popular .
And , to finish , I think it 's pretty obvious at least to who of us was in these remote areas , I realize that they 're not going to be at all .
For somebody 's home is .
They represent severing the human imagination that are rising at the dawn of the children , like the dreams of these children , like the dreams of our children , are part of the swipes .
First , we of National Geographic , we convinced that politicians will never come to .
We believe that the polemides --
[ Applastic is not persuasive , but we believe that stories can change the world , and maybe we 're the best institution to tell the stories of the world . Every month our site has been to tell the stories of the world . Every month is to tell the stories of the world .
156 countries spray our television channel .
Our reviews from millions of people .
Our work is to travel in the ethnosphere to bring our audience in places that are going to be absolutely cut out of how they 've seen and , they will , you hope , abbraced , they will be able to be able to existing in diversity , and we have to find a life in a pluralist and multicultural style in a pluralist and multicultural style in a world 's pluralist and multicultural reveal .
where all the people wisdom of all the people can contribute to our collective well-being .
Thank you .
I 'm going to talk about some things that I wrote in this book that I hope you 've heard about other than that you 've heard and I 'll try to figure out some connections , in case ,
I want to start with what I call the " dogma official dogma .
The official dogma of what ?
The official dogma of all the Western industrial dogma official dogma , " If we want to sweet the west of our citizens . " " " " The way to do it is massive to it . "
The reason is , from one hand , in fact that freedom is in itself a value , is a value , is a very precious , essential for humans .
On the other is that if we are free , each of us can act to do all of us can do to do everything that massive to our well-being , without no one that decides in the name of our be-being , without any that decides in the name of our .
The way to massive massive freedom is massive to massive it .
More choice people have , more they are libed , and more is their beef , more is their well-being .
So , this is so deeply radicated in society that nobody would dream to put it in doubt .
And it 's also roaded in our lives .
I 'm going to show you some examples of what progress has made possible .
This is my supermarket . It 's not particularly big .
I 'm lose a simple note on on the bottom of the hall .
In my supermarket , there are 175 conditions , without content oil variety of oil oil oil oil and 12 acks and 12 aceters that you can buy for a number of conditions that nobody of the 175 proning circumstance that nobody of the 175 proning is to your degree .
So that 's how the supermarket .
Then you go to the store of electronic to buy a stereo : casse , radio , piaright , practlificator .
And in this single store of electronic store , there 's a big number of components .
We can do six million and a half million different combinations using the components that there are only one store .
You have to admit that 's a lot of choice .
Other fields : the world of communications .
And once I was a child , you could get all the phone services , and they were all the services that were forign by mom Bell .
It was going to go out the phone , you didn 't buy it .
A consequence of that , between the other , was that the phone would never break .
These days are gone .
We 've now almost ill-limited variety of telephones , especially between mobile phones .
Here 's the cell phones .
My favorite is the one in the middle , MP3 , tall of the nose , and foreign for me to the critic critic critic .
If you don 't have seen it in the store under the bottom house , you 're well going to get .
And what happens is that people go into the gods and they do this question . And you know , what the answer is , " No . "
It 's not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn 't do too much .
So , in other life that are much more important than the aquers , you know , the same thing is explosion of choices .
Assistence health care : it 's not going on the United States that you go from the doctor and the doctor you tell what you have to do .
Instead , I went to the doctor , and the doctor says , " OK , we could do A , or B , " A has these benefits and these games " Bly-these benefits and these risks . What do you want to do ? "
You say , " Dotore , what should I do ? "
And the doctor says , " A has these benefits and these risks , and B has these benefits and these risks . "
" What do you want to do ? "
And you rebits : " Dotore if she was me , what would you do ? "
And the doctor : " But I 'm not . "
The result we call it " mality " , " expression " , " expression that makes it look like this .
But it 's actually not that a fishing and the responsibility of taking decisions by someone who knows know something , which is the doctor , to someone else that doesn 't know -- and so it 's not about -- and so it 's not about the ideal condition to make the patient .
There 's a huge marketing of drug drug products , direct to people like me and you , that if you think you don 't have any sense , because we can 't buy them .
But if we can 't buy them , because you have a public icize ?
The answer is that they want you to give it a doctor to ask them to be able to ask them to change it .
Something that 's so fundamental as our identity is an issue of choice , as you see in this jump , " We don 't want to force kids . We 're going to get their sex sex at the right time , " we don 't need to invent .
And we can reinvent us how many times we do it .
That means that every morning , at the risk , you have to be decide that kind of person you want to be .
It turns out to the family and marriage , a time the common perspective , which was almost for anybody , was that you married the most soon possible , and it was that you were married to the most soon possible , and you start with them .
The only real choice was with who , not when , and even what to do after .
And it 's really really , it 's playing .
I teach students very smart , and I do 20 percent less than a time .
And it 's not because they are just brilliant , not because they are less diligent .
but I 'm impensive , I 'm asking , I 'm going to ask you , " I should be married or not ? "
" Do I have to marry me later ? I have to think before or career ? "
They 're interrogatives .
And they try to answer these questions , even if this implesson , even though this implesson and I don 't get a beautiful vote to my examples .
And they have to do it . They 're important questions .
Now , the work : we 're lucky , like Carl underolineer , because technology allows us to work every minute , every day , from every day , on the angle of the planet , except that Hotel Randolph .
I 'm talking about , there 's a corner , and I won 't say to anybody , where the WiFi works .
I 'm not saying , because I want to use it .
What does this mean , this amazing choice we have about work ? It 's that we have to keep decide , continually decide , continually , if we have to work or not .
We can go to see our son playing hot , with cell phone , with cell phone in a pocket , Blackberry in the other , and the notextly , on the glass .
And even though they 're all spent , every minute we see our son ruining the game , we 're also asking this called ? "
" I have to answer this email ? I have to habababbozzing this letter ? "
And even when the answer is " no , " no , all this makes the experience of your son 's game that would be in other conditions .
So , from any way we look , little things and big , materials , big , materials and life is a question of choice .
And once the world was this : Ovation , there were some possibilities , but it wasn 't a question of choice .
The world 's world 's looks like this : The dilemma is , " Is it positive , or negative ? "
The answer is Scil : The answer is Science .
The positive latest latest . So I 'm going to talk about the negative .
This is a choice that 's two negative effects of the people .
The first , paradoxally , is that makes it paralysis that it 's a lot of liberation .
With a lot of options between which choosing , becomes very hard to do it .
I give you an example : a conduct example : a conduct on plans .
A connection of my colleagues had access to Vanguard 's data , the giant source of deep-pension clients , with about a million clients in 2,000 different companies .
What she turns out that for every 10 solutions that are actually offered in over , the percentage of adesion , the percentage of the two percent .
With 50 fourds s-offer-four-percent adhhhesions than when they are only five .
Because with 50 fourds fourds between which choosing , is maledtely hard to decide , and the choice is remaining tomorrow .
And tomorrow , and I still asked , tomorrow , tomorrow , tomorrow , and of course , it 's never going .
You know , it doesn 't just mean that these old work from the old people will eat food for dogs because they don 't have enough money , I also want to say that the decision is so hostical that lose the funds of the dator job .
They 're not participating , they 're losing up to five to ' 1,000 dollars per year from the job , which would be well .
So , the paralysis is a consequence of having too many choices .
And I think that makes the world like this .
" And to finish , for ethernity : ketchup , senape or maion ? "
You would like to take the right decision , if it 's for ethernity , right ?
You don 't want to choose the wrong fund , and it 's the wrong condition .
So this is the first effect . The second is that we even get to avoid paralysis and doing a choice , we 're less satis-fresh of the result of how we would be done with less options in which choose .
And this is a different time .
One of those is that with a lot of conditions , you know , if you buy one and it 's not easy , it 's easy to imagine that you could have a different choice of that you could have been better . And what 's going on is that the alternative to imagine , and the reflection , and the reject as the decision , and the replaced of the rest , and the reject is that you would have been better at the decision ,
And when it was a good decision .
Over the more choices , it 's easier to be displeasant than any detail that 's unsation-option of the choice .
And then , there 's what economists call to be expensive .
Dan Gilbert has asked a lot of stamattine as the value that we give things to the depend on what we 're confront .
And we know , when there are lots of options , it 's easy to be to be the attractive characteristics and be less suits of the option that you have been choice .
Here 's an example . I 've got all the ones that are not New York .
But that 's what you would probably think .
There 's this copy to the Hamptons .
A place of lussian .
Spidying . Otly splendida . It 's all for them .
It 's not missing . But what he thinks is , " Well , the buildings , it 's Agoam . "
" All my neighbors in Manhattan are away . "
" I could talk about gift right in front of the house . "
And it 's about two weeks assilled by the idea that 's losing -- every day -- every day -- the possibility of parking where it wants .
The expensive opportunity decrease the suit for what we have , even when choice was excellent .
And the most of the options we have to look , more the active characteristics will come back to the consto-opportunity .
Here 's another example .
This is telling us a lot of things .
It 's about living the moment , and maybe to live a slowly .
But the most important point is that you 're going to get , you know , you 're not doing other .
The things we don 't choose to take a lot of attract that they can make less attract what we do .
Third point : growing of the expectations .
I tried it on my skin buying a new jeans .
I 'm almost always jeans .
Once the jeans were just like , buying them and besty , they were besty , they were just after having brought them a life and work a lot of times , they started going to go well .
So I went to buy a couple of the old people were gone , and I said , " I need a couple jeans , this is my cutting . "
The committed me said , " Li wants slim , queen , lead relaxed ? "
Do you want to do with the cerniera or bottons ? " Stonewashed , " or " acidash " ? "
" Len wants ? "
" Do you want to hold them to be ? By bla -- " Continuated to elenjoy .
I was sballoon , and after a little bit , I could say , " I want to say , " I want to know what was , " I wanted to be , so for a time , I tried to all the jeans , and I got out of the jeans , and I would get out of the jeans that I had ever had .
It was the massive . With all that I had the best .
But I felt worse .
Why ? I wrote a whole book to understand it .
The reason I was worse is that with all that choice is that with all that choice was very high , the jeans had to be perfect .
I was at the beginning I had expected minds . I was waiting for anything exceptional when I saw 100 different , steps , accidents , at least one . But when I saw it , at least one had to be perfect .
What I had been buried , but not perfect .
After I had a chosen that I was trying to do with what I was trying to do was unsation-expectations .
The add of options in the life of the people don 't do that increases that they have respect to the excellence of options .
And this will be less satisfaction , even when the results are good .
Nobody in the marketing world 's going to realize .
Because if they knew that , you would not know what I 'm talking about .
The truth looks more like this .
" It was better when you were worse . " The reason that was better when you were worse is that when you were worse was still possible to meet of surprised .
Over the world we live in -- opulent , the citizens with the expectancy of performance -- the massive that we can hope is that things are at the altitution of the expectations .
You never have surprised as much as your expectations , my expectations , my expectations , I 'm unexpected .
The secret of happiness -- what you 're here -- is , " Baxis , " You know , " Yes , " Yes , " You know , " Yes , " Yes , " Yes , " Yes , " waiting . "
I mean , little whom I 'm really married and my wife is really married and my wife is really amazing .
I couldn 't do it , I couldn 't do it .
But it 's not always a bad thing .
And finally , a consequence of buying a couple of jeans , when you 're just saving this jeans is that when you 're not satisfacts , and you know , " Why ? "
" Who is responsible ? " , the answer is clear .
The world is responsible . What could I do you ?
When you have hundreds of kinds of jeans , and buy a unsatisfacing , and ask you who are the responsible , it 's the clear , it 's the clear , you know , you 're going to be .
You could have done better .
With hundreds of variety of variety , there are no skeeps on insuccess .
So when people take decisions , even if the result is the result is alid , they feel like they 're satives and give the colm , they sat their own .
In the last years , the depression is exploded in industry .
I think that a factor -- not the only one , but important -- of this honent honey , of this honey , because standards are too high .
And when they have to explain this situation , they think that the colvest is their own .
So the final result is that we 're in general , objectively , but we feel worse .
Let me remember you .
This is the official dogma , what we all take for buy and it 's completely fake .
There 's no doubt that a little bit of choice is better than I have a little bit of choice is better than a little bit .
There 's a critical value , magic value . I don 't know what it is .
But I 'm sure we 've been doing a piece of a piece of choice , where choices are improved in our life .
Now , from the political point of view -- I 've almost finally finally -- from political , noction is the following .
What it allows us all this choice in industrial society is wealth .
There are many places in the world , and you know , where the problem is not that they have been a choice .
The problem is that they have too bad .
So the factory I 'm talking about is a mal-exclusive being exugal of modern , wealthy society .
And what it does depress and angry is this : Steve Levitt Levitt has talked about how much those and expensive discovers for babs are unuseful .
I mean that these choices , complicated and available , is not that they 're just unuseful .
I 'm a deleterie .
They do us worse .
If you have a little bit of what our society is reversed in our society , and they were reversed in those where people have too few possibilities , they would not just their life to improve but also our own life .
This is what economists call a paretian improving improvement .
A redistribution redistribution is all right to the poor -- because of this choice in excess that it 's going to us .
And so , you can get it , you can become all what you want " --
You , people , culture , you think , " But what does it create that fish ? "
" It 's obvious that you can 't make anything in a boction . "
" A recastrated , a limited view of the world --
and I 've been interpreted that , at the beginning .
But then , I think , instead , I realized that that fish knows the long .
Because the reality of the facts is that if you missing the bocce , so that you can 't get the freedom . You get the paralysis .
If you break the bocting the bock that all possible to decrease .
You can get the well-being .
They all need a sphere .
This is almost certainly too close , maybe even for the fish , and it 's just just a fish , and it 's certainly for us .
But the absence of a little baby is a recipe for infelity and , I 'm afraid of a sudden .
Thank you very much .
