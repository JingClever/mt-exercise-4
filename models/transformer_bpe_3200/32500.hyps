I showed these slide demonstrated slide that the arccalotter , which for almost three million years has 48 million years had the size of 48 million years had the size of 48 .
But this subvaluable to gravity of the problem because it doesn 't show the spreading .
The arccalculotter is , in a sense , the clear cycle of global climate system .
It expands up on summer .
The next slide is going to be a quick carrelated to the advvocate over the last 25 years .
Spacks are reported in red .
As you see , they expand down to the blue scall .
That 's the ice in winter , which is retreatment .
You can see that the so-called ice , five years or more , is like blood , which is the blood , which here was in the body .
In 25 years , it 's gone .
This is a problem because the restage scale of the glaciated land around the arctic ocean where there are huge amounts of coal congelated carbon congrid , they have transformed into metry with microbes .
It turns out that it 's about the totality of global warming , that amount of global warming , that could double-down .
In some little deep laghi , Alaska a meter , it 's already rebolling from water .
The professor Katey Walter of Alaska University of Alaska team , a tiny last last slow .
Video : Wow ! Al Gore : Wow ! Al Gore : If we 're going to be we 're going to be .
One reason is that this termal exchange Groenland from the north .
This is a river in the glacial regime .
The laugh had never reached a similar .
This is the Kangerlussuaq , in the west of the Groenland .
If you want to know how the sea level of sea for the ice level of ice accounterraferm , here is where the sea .
These currents are increasing rapidly .
On the other side of the planet : Antarctica , the largest block of the planet .
The last month scientists have demand , the paintings of ice is in negative , and that pogggam , which pogggam , which pogggam , which pogggam in the sheleleless of the sometimes paint .
It 's six feet to six feet feet of the water level , like Groenland .
Sulla Himalayas , the third largely of ice , you see new laghi , which few years ago were ice .
40 percent of the world population is getting half of the water from that melt water from that leavailable .
Sulle Ande : this glacier is the source of the water source of this city .
The laughed .
But when they decreases , the same happens to water .
In California , the newspaper in California ,
The idrics are in crisis .
The predictions , as you read , they 're good .
The growing secure of secup in the world leads to an inceness .
The environmental disasters are increasing a rhythm out of the normal and without precedented .
Four times more numerous numbers in the last 30 years , I respect to 75 .
This is a whole thing that is insustainable .
If you look at it in the context they can see the consequences .
We 've added 70 million tons of CO2 every 24 hours -- 25 million tons of a 24 hours -- 25 million tons in the ocean every day .
Look at the Eastern area , the Americas , as , as well as well as , as well as the west , and on both the west of oxygen in the ocean .
The major causes global warming , together to deforestation , which is 20 percent of fossil fuel fuel .
The oil is a problem , and coal is even worse .
The United States is one of two more emissions , together to China .
And he was going to build a lot of other carbon coal .
But we 're seeing a direction changing .
These are the anullated projects in the last few years and some high-alternative green alternative projects .
Anyway , there 's a political load in our country .
The carbon industry and the oil have spent 250 million dollars in the last year to promote carbon , which is a oxide .
And that image reminded me , I would remember something --
Serce in Tennessee , where I live , there was a 3.8 billion g.
Maybe you saw it on news .
This is the second biggest flow of these last last flow in America .
It happened around Natal .
The puzzle of one of the carbon industry was this .
Video : Still .
It 's abundant here in America , and it grow our economy .
Frosty carbon is always cleaning .
It 's good price , adorable and the workers are going to keep the pend .
Al Gore : So , it 's a lot of West Virginia .
The biggest mineral society on the mountains is Massey Coal . This is his administrator .
Video : Don Blankenship : I 'll be clear -- Al Gore , Nancy Pelosy Pelotherwise , they don 't know what they 're talking about .
Al Gore : So the Alleance for the Clima has launched two campaign .
This is a thing .
Video : Acore : Actually , ALergy , we see climate changes as a sery of a sery of our business .
So , for that priority is investing a large amount of money in a effort to make public and confused to make public and confused the fuel .
In fact , carbon is not sports .
We think it 's clean -- it 's also a good profum .
So , not pack of climate change .
Let me do it .
Video : Carbone : Carbone -- you 've heard a lot of them .
So let me turn a turn into a structure of the avaning , in a little bit about the puly-lights .
Stransport ! The cars are a little rumor , but this is the sound of the puly-carbon technology .
The carbon consumption is between the main causes of global warming , but the pully remarkable technology that you see changes everything .
Take a look : this is the puly-carbon technology .
Al Gore : So , the positive alternative alternative security and the national security .
Video : A : The America is in crisis ; the economy , the national security , the climate crisis .
The whose links all : our dependence from fossil fuel fuel , like coal fuel and oil .
Now , there 's a new , audace solution to come out .
It 's 100 percent clean energy , in 10 years .
A plan to remain America to work , make sure more you make sure , and help stop the global warming .
Finally , a solution that behind our problems .
Repower . Scoprite more .
Al Gore : This is the last .
Video : It 's about refting energy to report .
One of the fastest ways to bring the dependence from the combustible dependence that killing our planet .
So , it 's the future is here . Very , a new energy network .
So , it 's a very much more than two : Negetables for jobs .
Comment : Repower America . It 's time to be realists .
Al Gore : A old proverbio says , " If you want to go fast , go to fast .
If you want to go away , you go together . "
We need to go away , quickly .
Thank you very much .
LHC . Last year we did a LHC .
And I promise to return to get up how the car works .
So here I 'm here . And for those people who had no , the LHC is the biggest scientific experiment ever -- 27 kilometers of circles .
His task is to reflare the conditions that were present less than a billion of the universe -- until 600 million times a second .
All that 's just ambique .
This is the machine below Ginevra .
We take these min-Big Bang in the remarkers .
This is what I work . It 's called ATLAS -- he 's about 44 feet and has a diameter diameter in 22 feet .
This is an ATLAS in building , you can see proportions .
On 10 september last year , we have accesum the car for the first time .
And this picture was taken by ATLAS .
It was because of immense festeggives in control room .
It 's a picture of the first fascion that had made all around the LHC , entering in collision , in collision , with a part of the LHC , and spread particles the detector .
In other words , when we see that image 10 september , we realized that the car worked , which is a great wictory .
I don 't know if it was this to make us more or this , when somebody went on on Google and saw that the starts was this .
That means that we have had cultural impact beyond .
About a week later , there was a problem with the car , just had to these sleep here -- these sleep .
These fles are 13,000 amps when the machine works at the massive .
Now , the technical technical between you are going to look at the flows and say , " It 's not true . I 'm very sound too sound . "
And they can do it because when they 're very frequently , they get the superconvicted by the way .
So , at least 271 degrees , at least 271 degrees , at least , these files can bring that run .
In one of the juntures of the most novehicle in the LHC , there was a defect of fect .
So the files surprised , and the 13,000 ampant suddenly meant , they meet a electrical resistance .
This was the result .
Now , this is even more impressive if you think these fish more than 20 tons , and that have been moved about 30 centimeters .
They 're damaged about 50 magneti .
We had to take them , what we did .
We restinated them and enaged .
Now they 're coming back all the subground .
By the end of marke the LHC is going to be a new integral .
We 'll access it , and we 're going to get the right data or the lightforward , and we 're going to go so our adventure to discover what are the morning the universe .
Now , of course , in a certain way , these accidents reach the debate on the value of science and engineering in front . It 's easy to conviction . It 's easy to confuture .
I think the fact that it 's so hard , the fact that it 's the value of things like LHC .
I would like to end with the words of a English scientist , Humphrey Davy , which , I think , in defense of unuseful experiments of his pupille , his pulle was Michael Faraday , said , " Nothing is so dangerous for the progress of human mind how the mind reverse the ideas of science is definitive , that we don 't have any any nature , that our triumphed in nature , and not there are full month . "
Thank you .
I want to start asking you to rethink of when , you play with children , you play with the morning .
As you can get them and get them , and get them and get them , take them and move them , learn , you know , you know , we actually learn to think and solve problems with space relationships .
The space reasoning is deeply connected to the way we understand a lot of the world around us .
So , as a computer scientist performed by the use of physical objects , together my physical consults , and my collaborator Jeevan Kalanithi , I started asking myself , " And if , when we use a computer , instead of having the mouse as a digital poly-digital deal that moves on on a desktop , we could make sure that moves on on a desktop , we could make a very much information with both hands ,
and do it to do it ?
The question was so interesting that we decided to explore the answer , building the Siftable .
In a few words , a Siftable interactive is a great interactive .
In a few words , a Siftable interactive is a great interactive .
You can move with them , they can be able to see them , they can be able to hear their movement and they have a screen and a radio wireless .
But in fact , I 'm physical objects , like the mors , you can just move it to be just grasp them .
The Siftable is the example of a new ecosystem of tools to manipulate digital information .
And as they become more physicists , consciousness , consciousness of the other , and as they become more physicists , consciousness , the other , of how they are moving them , we can explore new and fun and fun and fun and fun and fun and fun interaction .
I 'll start with some simple example .
This Siftable is configured to show video : if you 're going to stop video .
These interactive portraits is conscious restraired rups .
If you ran them , they 're interested in what they 're going to do .
If they 're surrounded , they can see it and they can act a little bit .
If they 're surrounded , they can see it and they can act a little bit .
They also have their movement and inclination .
We then realized that one of the most implications of the interaction was to be able to use common management , for example , " a color as if it was a liquid .
In this case , we have three Siftable as a bucks and I can use them to fix the central color in that central , where they put .
and I can use them to do this for the color in that central , where they missed .
We 're going to get a little bit of place .
There are also beautiful possibility of learning , like language , and the mathematics , and logic games where people can try to experience things , and see the results immediately .
Now I 'm ...
This is a sequence of Fibonacracks that I do with a program of equations .
Here we have a play of words that 's in half of Scarabeo and Boble .
Pratically , at every turnal , you get a letter , at every Siftable , Pratically , at every Sifable , and as you 're looking at every Sifable , and as you 're looking for words , and you 're looking for a dictionary .
Then , about 30 seconds remissed , and you have a new letters and new possibility to try .
Thank you .
So here 's the children come to the Media Lab , I did this so that I tried them and I went to a video .
They are very pleased .
And one of the interesting things like this kind of application is that you don 't have to give people many education .
You just say , " Compon words , and they know what to do .
So here 's other people who try it .
This is our younger beta right there , right there on the right .
It really wanted to impilate them .
They were just just morning , for him .
Now , this is a application of a interactive cartoon .
We wanted to build a tool for the Lui apprenticing language is Felix .
It can insert new characters in the scene , by by being by by being dissociated .
It can insert new characters in the scene , by by being by by being dissociated .
So , he 's doing the sun .
Video : The sun is source .
David Merrill : Now it took a tretor in the scene .
Video : The treatment treatment .
Bel work ! Yeah !
So , by a while by a Siftable and put them neighborhood --
Video : Bau !
-- inventing your story .
Video : Hi !
DM : It 's a story with the open , and it can decide him as you want .
DM : It 's a story with the open , and it can decide him as you want .
Video : From , yes .
DM : The last example I have time to show you is a tool , realized , recently , to truck and executionary music .
It 's a tool , made of recent , to tramples and executives .
The Siftable here , based on the ground , based on the ground and bacteria .
Each one of these has four different variations , and you can choose which use .
And you can also put these sound in a sequence to get these sound .
And it just just by making it touch a sound and a sequence .
These are effect that you can control from the vivivivivivivivivious , like reverberal and filter .
The attacks to a particular sound and then fire for them .
And then there are the general effects as time and volume , which are applied to sequence .
Let 's look like .
Video : We 'll start with a couple of Siftable sequence , we 'll be able sequence , we 'll put it in a series , we 'll add it , we 'll add it , we 'll add the other basic .
Now I 'll put a basement line .
Video : DM : I add some percussions --
Video : DM : And I 'll put the bacteria , so I can control the alive .
Video : I can get the whole sequence of the sequence of time from one side or another .
Video : DM : And I 'll add the basement to give more expression .
Video : I can recombine the sequence to flight .
So I don 't have to plan it before , but I can suddenly suddenly make it longer .
And now , finally , I can spend the whole sequence on the left the Siftable .
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is to build new interfaces of the machine that 's more and more soemer like our brain and body .
And today , I had time to show you one of the results of this path , and some possibility that we try to bring out from the lab .
The concept I want to transmit is that 's coming up this new generation of designed objects to interact with digital media , which will bring information in our world in the way we want .
Thank you very much .
I don 't see the time to talk to you with all of you .
I 'm a writer .
I think I 'm going to be a profession , but it 's more than that , of course .
It 's also love and the fascination of my life .
And I don 't expect that it can change .
But , I said , something particularly happened in my life and my career , who brought me to get the whole relationship with this work .
The particular thing is that I recently written this book , this biography called " Mania , " Ama , " Ama , diversally from my books , for some reason came out in the world and became a big , a sense , and the interational , and the interational ,
And the result is that everywhere is is going to be hour , people treat me as though I was convicted .
Really -- convicted , convicted .
They 're all right now I care and they say , " Don 't you fear to do it better ?
Do you fear to keep writing for all life without being able to create a book that can be able to create a book that can important to somebody ? "
who can care about somebody ? "
It 's reassurance , you know .
But it may go worse , except for me , I remember that I 'm over 20 years ago , when I started to say , I was a writing -- I was a writer .
I 'd like to go back to the same reaction that was based on .
And people said , " Don 't you could have succeed ?
Do you fear that the humiliation of kill you ?
Do you fear to do this window for all life without nothing nothing else else ever out and die on a heart of all the way out and die on a heart of behind the failure ? "
So , you know .
The answer -- the short answer to all these questions is , " Yeah . "
Yeah , I 'm afraid of all those things .
I 've always had fear .
And I also feel very fear of many other things that people can 't have .
As the algae and other things .
But , as as I would write what I thought and ask me , I would ask me , is why ?
Is it rational ?
It 's logical that anybody has to wait to be very spentented by a job that I 've been born to do .
But what is that particularly in the creative impress that makes us nervous health is about mental health is that they don 't do ?
How father , for example , he was a chemical engineer and I don 't remember one time in his 40 years of activity that was asked if he had fear to be engineer capita ?
There was never -- that was that block of engineers John , how do it ?
Don 't work that , you know ?
Onestly , chemical engineers like group have no matter , they have no matter , in the centuries , warning the depressive to be alcolized maniaces .
We writers , we have enough this reputation , and not just writers , but creativity of all kinds , we have this reputation of being enormous instable .
And it 's not just looking at the triad of the deaths of the magnificments that , only only in the 21st century , they die young young young and hand .
And even those who didn 't have been suiciddenly disfaced by their dunes .
Norman Mailer , before he died , in the last interview said , " Every my book killed me a little more " an extraordinary affermation about the work of his life .
But we don 't beat the bitch when we feel that , because we 've heard these things so long than we have , and accepted the notion that creativity and the notion that creativity and suffering is somehow tired and art , the end , it will always be able to be able to always the angoscious .
And the question I want to ask all here today is : Are you agree with this idea ?
You know this thing -- because even looking at it from a centimeter of distance to me , it doesn 't really good for this support .
I think it 's odious .
And I think it 's also dangerous and I don 't want to see perpetuated perpetuated in the next century .
I think it 's better to encourage our big creative minds .
And I surance that , in my case -- in my situation -- it would be very dangerous to start fuse up to that dark the supply supply towards that supply disruption that I 'm in my career .
That 's really -- you know , you know , I 'm pretty young , I have about 40 years .
I still have about four work decades .
And it 's very likely that whatever I 'm going to be right now , it 's going to be judge from the world as the work that came out after the successful of my last book .
I 'm going to be slavery because we 're all more or less frightened here -- it 's likely that my big successful .
Oh , Gesus , who thought !
You know this is the kind of thinking that leads a person to start behind yourself in the morning of the nine morning and I don 't want to do it .
I would keep doing this work that I love .
So , the question is , what 's like ?
And so , I think , after many reflections , which the way to work to keep writing is to create a psychological construcstrucstrucstruction , OK ?
I have some way to find a security distance between me , I 'm writing , and my natural anxial anxial rupt , and as I was trying to get a time , and I was trying to find the other society to see if they could have some better ideas and more healthy and look at the time , trying to find other society to see if they could have more and more healthy .
how to help people creative emotivates to manage emotivity .
And that research has taken me to the ancient Greek and ancient Rome .
I 'm going to go through the circle and then comes back .
In the ancient Greek and ancient Rome -- people didn 't seem to believe that creativity self-ageeeths , OK ?
And it was thinking about creativity was this required watch and that solid to men from some distant source and unknown , for distant reasons and unknown , for distant reasons and unknown .
The Greeeks were called these spirites of creativity demand .
Socrate , wonderful , he believed to have a load eling saggerity from far away .
The Roomes were the same idea , but they were called the spirit species .
which is great , because the Roands didn 't think a really think that a genius was particularly intelligent .
They thought that a genius was this kind of devine entity that had literally been living in the muralls of an artist , some like the elpho Dobby , and that came out to assisters the work of the artist and models the result of the artist and modeled the result of that work .
Here 's -- here 's the distance of which I talk about -- that 's the distance of which I 'm talking about -- that 's the distance of your work .
And everybody knew that was how it worked , right ?
So , the antiks were protected by certain things , like , for example , too much , not ?
If your work was exceptional , you couldn 't take all the place , everybody knew that you were helped by this incorporate genius .
If your work failed , it wasn 't your whole , right ?
Everybody knew that was your genius to be an inable .
And so people are han conceived creativity in the West for a long time .
And then the Renaissent came and everything changed , and all this big idea ; we put the human center of the universe over the universe over and the mysteries and no more leave space creatures that writing the degree that writing the deal that writing the deal of the deadvinity .
This was the principle of humans and people started thinking about creativity , and people started thinking about creativity , completely from the isse .
And for the first time in history , they started to refly this or artist as a genius , like a genius , like a person with genius .
And I have to tell you , I think it was a big mistake .
I think I allow someone , a simple person to believe that they 're like a recipient , the essence and the source of all the mysteries , creativity , unknown , unknown , unknown , unknown , unknown , unknown , you know , it 's a very large file too big to give to the human break .
It 's like to ask someone to enjoy the sun .
Deform and demal with the ego and creates all these inestishes on performance .
And I think it was this pressure that I 've destroyed artists in the 500 years .
And if this is true , and I think it 's , the question becomes , and now ?
Can we do it ?
Maybe you can go back to a more ancient understanding of human relationships and creative mystery .
Or maybe not .
Maybe we can 't sent 500 years of rational thinking in a 18 minutes .
And there 's probably people in the audience that would have a legitimate scientific sospects on the notion of , they follow the people , they 're going to follow the next people , they 're doing the next projects .
I 'm going to tell you all about this thing .
But the question I would like to ask is -- why isn 't no ?
Why don 't you think that way ?
Because it has more sense of everything that has ever heard to explain the experant imprevebility of the creative process .
A process that , as anybody who ever tried to do something -- so , basically , everybody here -- knows , you know , you don 't get rationally .
And , in fact , it can sometimes sometimes it all looks like .
I did this meeting recently with the extraordinary poetry Stone , who has now 90 years old , but he was a poem for all life and told me that during his infants in the rural Virginia , worked out in the fields , and he was working on the bodies , and he was going to be in if a poem came from the landscape .
He said , he was like a frageous train .
And he was rotolling to her from the landscape .
He felt that , because he did he was going to be able to throat the ground .
He knew that I had one thing to do that point and was , her , words , " running like a match . "
And so it would like to the house and it was sent from this poem , and he wouldn 't have to get a little piece of paper and a match and a pretty quickly from , as the trapes and grabbed it on the page .
Sometimes you couldn 't be fast enough , so it goes and it would keep and correcreceive and the round with no way to get home and her rotolar , and he would continue to rotolar through the landscape , looking for , as she said , " another poet . "
And then there were those times -- this piece of time , I 'll never forget it -- there were moments in which was almost losing , OK ?
So , he was running home and he was looking for paper and he was looking for paper , and he was just going to go through , and then he said , that he was as if you were going to go up with the other hand and stepped the other hand and stepped the coffee .
Acccil was the coda and remain his body and remain his body and transcscscreamed it on the page .
And in these cases , the poem would be presented on the perfect and intact , but the contrast , as the last word to the first .
So when I thought I -- I 'm crazy , it 's exactly the same same same as my creative process .
Not all my creative process -- I 'm not a conviction .
I 'm a mule , and my way to work is ; I 'm wake up to me at the same orary every day and work and passionately .
But even I , in my head , I 've been striped on that thing , sometimes .
And I think that many of you do the han .
You know , even though the work and ideas came up with a certain source , you can 't honestly know .
And what is this thing ?
And how can we relate to it in a way that we don 't lose your head , but , rather , what do you get us to do it ?
As I 'm about , the best example of the contemporary example I have is the Mician Tom Waits , which I 've interviewed several years ago for a newspaper .
We were talking about this , and you know , Tom , for the majority of life has been the incarnation of the contemporary ctually , trying to control these species , to provide these species , to deal these species of impulses .
But then he was invite , he had calculated , and one day he was driving on a Los Angeles , changed all for him .
He was going to be able to be able to do this little piece of melody , who 's coming in his head as a head as a inspiration , and it 's an inspiration and the desider , and the desider wants , but it doesn 't know how to take it .
It 's not a paper , it has no paper , it has no register .
So it starts to feel this kind of old , I 'm going to grow up in him , " I 'm going to lost , and I 'll remarrrrate .
I 'm not good enough and I can 't do it . "
And instead of going to go to panic , he stopped .
And he got the whole process of mental and made something completely new .
He just just just the sky and said , " Scut , I 'm not driving ? "
" Do you think it can write a song now ?
If you really want to have , you get a more opporting time when I can take care of you .
Otherwise , you go to importantly somebody else today .
You 're going to disturbing Leonard Cohen . "
And his process changed this process changed .
Not the work , the work , it was still dark as a time .
But the process , and the anxist of anxiety that was reflew when the genius , the genius that outside the other problems and the problems and reliberated it . And I got it back from where , realizing that didn 't have to be a interized thing and hasn 't have to be a interized thing and handed .
but you do this peculiar collaboration , wonderful bizarre collaboration with Tom and this strange and outside that , but it was not Tom .
So , as I felt that story began to change a little bit the way I was working and I had already saved me .
This idea , I 'm saved when I was writing " Mangia , Prega , Ama , and falls in one of those cave disperation where we 're caused all working on something and we can 't start thinking that it will be a disaster , which is the worst book that ever written .
Not just bad , just the worst book written .
And I started thinking about throwing this project .
But then I remember Tom who was talking to the air and I tried us .
So I raised my face on the hand-up and rights my common to a vacuum corner .
And I said , " Look , what , you both know , if this book is not going to be brilliant , isn 't going to be quite brilliant , no ?
Because as I 'm putting it all I have , I don 't have this .
So if you want to be better , you have to presented you and do your part .
Okay . But if you don 't do it , you know what , I don 't do it .
I 'll just write the same because it 's my work .
And I would like to do , please that was that I presented to do my part , " Because -- finally it 's so , OK -- centuries ago in the deserts , people would duned for the moon , the moon , dances and music that went on and hours that went on and hours to go on and hours to the dawn .
And they were always magnifics , because the ballers were professional and they were great .
But every time , rarely , something happened , and one of these artists became transcendent .
And I know you know what I 'm talking about , because I know you all saw it , at some point , a performance so .
It was as if time , you stopped , and the dance walked through a kind of lander and was doing nothing different from the usual , but all it was going .
And suddenly , it doesn 't seem just like a human .
But it turns out from the divinity in the fuocal illuminated in the fuocal .
And when this happened , they were , people knew what was , they would call it .
They had hands and start to sing , " Allah , Allah , Allah , God , God , " God , God , " God , God , "
That 's God , you know .
Curious note -- when the Mororge invaded the south of Spain , I took this habits with them and the pronuncraced in the centuries , Allah , Allah , " in the Ole , Allah , " in the Ole , you can still hear in the corrids or the flamp .
In Spain , when a artist did something impossible and magic , " Allah , " Allah , " A. " By , " incomprehensible , " unable , " it -- a last of God .
And it 's great because we need it .
But the problem comes the day after , for the dancer , the same , when you wake and discover that 's 11 on the morning of Martedday and the last 11 of God .
It 's just a great ginock with grandal glasses , and maybe it will never get it more to get that altitude .
And maybe nobody 's going to sing the name of God , and what does it do with the rest of his life ?
It 's hard .
This is one of the most painful recognilization to make in a creative life .
But maybe it doesn 't have to be so angoscious if you can 't believe , mostly , that the most extraordinary aspects of your being come from yourself .
But you just believe that that you 're being data in prested by an inimaginable source of this team has to go to qualcry , when you 're finished .
And , you know , if we think that way it 's changing .
And so I started thinking about it , and it 's certainly how I thought I was a different months in the work that I 'll give them on the perieral , dangerous , attesissues , attesissimo , attesissues followed the successful .
And what I have to keep telling me when I feel electric . .
It 's not just your work . It 's just your work .
It 's a presenting presenting you for your part , any can be .
If you 're dance , you get it .
If you get , you know , it 's absurd , it 's just just a few kind of wonderful , for one moment , for one moment , just a moment through your efforts , then , " Ole ! "
Or you do the same your dance .
And it 's like , " at yourself .
I think , and I think it 's got to teach it .
" Ole ! " You know , just for a human and headquarters and headquarters to make you go down to present you continue .
Thank you .
Thank you .
June Cohen : Ole !
As you know I 've already talked about some of these projects on human genome , what can meet and the discovery of new genes .
Now we 're starting a new perspective . We started to digitize biology and now now starting with the digital code we 're coming into a new phase of biology , designing and synthesizing life .
We always tried to ask big questions .
What 's life ? " It 's something that many biologists think they have tried to understand vary var .
We tried different processes , reduced it to the minims .
We 're digitizing from almost 20 years .
When we sequenced the human genome was going to go from analome world of biology in the digital world in the digital world .
Now we ask us : can we regenerate life , or create new life from this digital universe ?
This is the map of a little organism , Mycoplasma genitalium , which is the species from the smallest genome between those who can authorism .
And we tried to reduce the genome to create a little bit more .
We can eliminate a hundred genes of about 500 .
But when we look at his metabolic map , it 's relatively simple than our .
So , I think , this is simple .
But when we look at all the genes that we can eliminate , one one at the time , it 's very unlikely that this can bring a living cells .
So we decided that the only way to procret was synthesize this chromosome of these chromosome of these fundamental questions .
And so we started the adventure of the " can we synthesize a chromosome ? "
Can we have chemistry to make these big molecules that we never had to create these big molecules that we never had to create before ?
And in case , in case , we can make a chromosome ?
A chromosome is just a piece of chemical material .
The speed with which we 're capable to digitize life is growing in the exponential .
Our capacity to write the genetic code , instead , progret , but it 's getting a better degree .
And our most recent results the results , the results ,
We started over 15 years ago .
The process of reports , starting with a bioethical review before we started the first experiments .
But we found that synthesize DNA is very difficult .
There are tens of thousands of cars in the world that make small segments , long , long , the long time of 30 to 50 letters , and it 's a degenerative process : the more segment is longer , the most mistakes .
So we had to develop a new method for assemble these fragments and correcrect the mistakes .
And this was our first attempt , starting with digital digital genome , from the Is 174 .
It 's a little virus that kills bacteria .
We designed the fragments , effective the rules and get a DNA molecule and get a DNA molecule .
The interesting part is when we took this chemical material , inert , and we put it in bacteria , bacteria have started reading this genetic code and to produring the viral particles .
The viral particles have been released by the cells , they went back and come back and destroyed the E.
I 've been talking about recent with the oil industry , they 're certainly compressed this model .
They recognize them .
We think that this is a situation where software can really build its own hardware in a biological system .
But we wanted to do things bigger .
We wanted to build the whole chromosome bacteria .
It 's over 580 thousands letters of genetic code .
So we thought we build it in the size of the virus , so we can change the cassets , so we can change the cassets to understand what are the components of a living cells .
The design is crucial , and if we start with digital information in a computer , they have to be very accurate .
When we sequenced this genome for the first time in 1995 accurate it was a mistake for every 10 thousands .
We found it , resequenced it , 30 mistakes . If we had that original sequence would never be able to do it work .
One part of the process is designing 50 letters that overlap over over over 50 letters to build subunits of 50 letters to build subunits to build subunits that work together .
We try and unique elements here .
You probably have you read that we 're going to read that we 're going to have a bed .
Think of that , we have a genetic code based on four letters : A , C , C , G and To .
Three of those letters put together about 20 adminods , and there 's a specific order of reading for every lominominods .
So we can use the genetic code to write words , frases , thoughts .
What we did at the beginning was autographed .
Some of them have been dolusers from the fact that it wasn 't poem .
We designed these segments to just join them with enzymes .
There are entertaining them and they put them up and put them on them .
And we started assemble with segments , starting with segments , and then a five mile letter , and so they can make segments of 24 thousands of 24 thousands and thousands of them up to them .
And we made these segments in abundance , so we 've made these segments that we 're trying to make an extremely robads -- as you 'll see in a minute .
We 're trying to automatize the process .
So , this seems like the tabellon a basket player .
When we get these very long , we 're going to get these very long , more than 100 thousands , they will not grow up in the E.
It 's coming to the modern instruments of molecular biology .
So we consider other mechanisms .
We knew about another mechanism called recombination omologists , and in biology , and it 's used to repair the DNA that can join the segments .
Here 's an example .
This organism , called Deinococcus radiodurans , it can absorb three million radiation .
You can see in the upper square as his chromosome as his chromosome .
In 12 -- 24 hours , it 's reassembled exactly as it was before .
There are thousands of organisms that they are able to do it .
These organisms can sit completely .
They can live under a vacuum .
They 're absolutely , of course , the life in space , and you feel to find new environments of water .
ASA showed it that this is .
This is a picture of the molecule that we built these processes , just using these processes , just using the segments to put on the segments .
The lights assemble them .
This image was not taken with a microscope , but with a microscope , but with a microscope .
It 's a big molecule that we can see with a light microscope .
These are pictures that cover a time of about six seconds .
This is the commercial that we 've done a little time ago .
It 's over 580,000 letters of genetic code .
It 's the largest molecule of a defined structure ever created by man .
It has 300 million molecular weight .
If you stampassionate it with a 10 without spaces , you would take 142 pages only to transcscscreen to transcscscscreaming .
Now , how do we work ? How do we do it ?
Of course , you 're tramed a virus is a play .
It 's a little bit more complicated when they use bacteria .
It 's easier when it comes to eucariote cells like our : you can just extract nucleus and put one more , which is basically the process of cloning .
In the bacteria , the chromosome is integrated inside the cell , but we recently demonstrated that we are able to make a complete transplant of one cell from one another and to another cell and to get it .
We clear a chromosome from a microbial cycle .
The two are different as humans from the mouse .
We added a few genes more so that we can decide what to do is to decide what this chromosome .
And then I 'm skip with the enzymes , you know , I 'm going to kill all proteins .
And when we put it in the cells was really wonderful -- and you 'll appreciate our sophisticatoomic graph -- the new chromosome cell .
And we started thinking that we couldn 't go beyond , but we tried to get us more .
This is one of the major mechanisms of evolution .
We found that a lot of species have added species , they 've added a second chromosome , added in a second thousand new tracts of new tracts that species .
So who think about evolution as a gene at the time that has not been understood a lot of biology .
There are essentially restraired by restrition , which I think digerate the DNA .
The chromosome that was in the cells doesn 't have one .
The cell phone chromosome that we put down down to the shit .
It expressed the other chromosome as an expressed material chromosome , has masticated , and we found it with only the cell and the new chromosome .
It became blue because of the genes that we put .
And in a short lass of time , all the characteristics of a species went . And it turned around a new species , based on the new software that we put in the cells .
All the protects have changed , the membranes have changed , and when we read the genetic code is exactly what we 've transferted to .
Now , this may seem genetic alchemy , but altering the software , we can change things in a very cheap .
Now , I 've already explained that there 's no genesesis -- but to progress from three million years and a half million years of evolution , and I said that maybe we 're perhaps to create a new kind of based on this digital explosion in which will be created new species on this digital process .
Why do that ?
I think it 's quite obvious when we think about our necessities .
We 're going to go from six and a half billion people in the next 40 years .
Just to give an example : I was born in 1946 .
Now there are three people on the planet for each existing in 1946 , there 's four years , there will be four .
We 're having problems now to find food , fresh water and pull , medical water and drug , drug and a half billion people .
It 's going to be more hard to do it for nine billion .
We use more than five billion carbon , more than 30 billion carbon , more than 30 billion bures .
That means a hundred million barrel per day .
When we try to find biological processes , or any kind of replace , it will be a huge challenge .
And we have to keep the whole CO2 emission of all these materials that end up in the atmosphere .
At the day of today , thank you for scientific discoveries in all the world , we have a database with about 20 million genes , and I like to think they are the design components .
The electronic industry has only one dozen about these different things , and think about how many different things are coming out .
Our limitations here are the principles of the reality and our imagination .
Now we have a techniques , because of these quick methods , able synthesization , able to create what we call a combinatory genomics .
We can build a million chromosome on that can produce a million chromosome per chromosomes a day .
Think of processing these 20 million genes , or optimize the processes to produce eightary processes , and new vaccines , we can change , through a little team , and create more biology now that in the last 20 years of science .
And it 's just a standard selection .
We can choose to survival , chemical production or fuel production , or fuel production .
This is a moment of some software programmed that we 're working on the way we 're working to be able to seats and design species on the computer .
Well , we don 't necessarily know how it will be .
We know exactly how it 's their genetic code .
We 're looking at the quarter generation of the quarter generation .
You see that you also extract from granol was a bad experiment .
We have a second and third generation that they 're going to be used to be sugar with sugars in the higher value of eight-different kinds of behind or different type .
But the only way the biology is to have a great impact without increasing more than the cost of food and limitary the cost of food and limitary the cost of food and limitary the cost of food , and we 're working on design cells that can reach , and we think that we can get the first carbon , and we think we can have the first carbon of four months .
The solar light with CO2 is a metodo-- but in our discoveries around the world , we found different metods .
This is a organism that we described in 1996 .
It lives in the deep ocean , about 2,500 feet deep at the temperature of water temperature .
They create a metane that 's CO2 , they 're using molecular hydrogen energy source .
We 're trying to understand whether we can can be CO2 , which can easily be transported through your own tubs , converting that CO2 in carbon , to drive this process .
So , a long time we think that we might be able to increasing what the basic question of " what 's life is , " We , verorean exhibit of replace the whole oil oil oil oil oil oil .
Exactly . If you can 't do it from TED , where can you ?
It would be a main energy source .
And also , we 're working for using the same metods to create instantaneous instantanic vaccines .
You saw this year with flu , we 're always always back to a year and with a dollar , when it 's about finding the right vaccine .
I think what you can change by combinable vaccines in advaccines .
And that 's how the future might start looking like , now , the evolution tree , the evolution , accelerating evolution with synthetic bacterial cells , aroote .
We 're so far from improving people .
Our purpose is to make it way long enough to try to live long enough to try to do it . Thank you very much .
First of all I 'll show you , the fastest possible , some fundamental work , the new technology that we took the Microsoft , nearly a year ago . This is Seadragon .
It 's a environment in which you can interact is local remote with a huge amount of visual data .
And we 're seeing a lot of gigabyte digital photographs with a kind of zoom and continuous , for a panoramic fast , and by a panoramic fast , and now , and now , for a picture .
And it doesn 't matter how much much much much of the amount of information that we see , how big these things are these data , or images .
Most of the digital photographs , but this is a scanning scanning from the Library of Congress , and recomes into the range of 300 megapieces .
It doesn 't make any difference because the only thing that limits the prestations of a system like this is the number of pixels on your screen in any time . It 's also a very flessible architecture .
This is a book , example , of data not images .
This is the Casa desolate of Dickens . Every colonna represents a chapter .
To show you that it 's just about textbook and not images , we can do something like this , to really see that this is a real representation of text , not a picture .
It may be a way a little artificial to read a electronic book .
Not you consiice .
This is a more realistic example . It 's a number of the Guardian .
Every image is the beginning of a section .
And it really gives you the pleasure of reading the real version cartable version of a magazine , which is for a moltex , which is for a moltex .
We also made something with the corner of this particular number of the The Guardian .
We created a high buns ads , and we put up to a very much more than what you use in a normal advertising , and we put extra content .
If you want to see the characteristics of this automobile , you can see here .
Or other models , or even the techniques .
And this really demonstrates some of these ideas to eliminate the limits of space on the screen .
We hope that this means to put up to pop-up and other doors , and other doors , not to be necessary .
Of course , the map is one of the most obvious applications for this kind of technology .
And I don 't want to lose time , if we don 't say we have contribute to give them in this field .
These are all the streets in the U.S. sovers over an image of NASA .
So we 're going to go to something else .
This is actually actually the live live on the web ; you can go to see it .
It 's a project called Photosynthy , which combine two different technologies .
One is Seadragon and the other is a very interesting visual computer research made by Noah Snavely , a student at the University of Steve Snavely , with Steve Seitz Seitz , the UW SS and Rick Szeliski Rick Szeliski . An a good good collaboration .
And it 's from the Web , managon the web , managon .
You can see it when we do this kind of screens , where we can go from a image to another and have this kind of experience , and have this kind of experience ,
But the space collocation of the images here has actually a meaningful .
The algorithms of computers have been taken these images , so that corresponds to revers , so that correspond to the real places that I think -- all skept close to the Grass , the Montagne Rockass , they 've been taken . Here , you see the elements of a de-stable show or imaging , and these things are all spaces of space , and these things are all spaced at the space level .
I don 't know if I have time to show you some other environment .
There are a lot more space .
I want to go directly to one of the original Noah-- and this comes from a privivision of Photosynthy that we 've made for the first time , the last summer , showed you what I think is really the key to show you what I think is really the key behind this technology , Photosynthetics . And it 's not necessarily obviously obviously , we put in the website .
We had to worry about legal aspects and so on .
This is a rebuild of Notre Dame images in Notre Dame images in Flickr . Bast digital Notre Dame Dame , Flickr and you get some kind of the sorts and on . Oach one of these horange areas . And you get one of these orange orange areas that 's discovered to this model .
So , they 're all images from Flickr and they were all linked at space level in this way .
And it 's possible to be able to navigate in this very simple way .
You know , I would never thought I 'd end up working for Microsoft .
It 's very gratification I get this kind of accovery here .
I think you can see that it 's a lot of different photos of these cell phones to those of cell phones to those professional SLR , a meaningful number , put together in this environment .
And if I can , I try to look for those strange .
Many of them are faces , etc .
Somewhere you have a series of photographs -- it .
This is a poster of Notre Dame Dame Dame correctly .
We can go from poster to the physics of this environment .
The essential point is that we can do things with social environment . This is now taking data from the whole memory of the interest memory of how it looks like the Earth 's land , from the visual point of view -- and connections and connecconnects all those data .
All those pictures become linked together , more than the sum of the parts .
You have a model of the Earth 's entire emerging .
Think about this as a prolungation of Stephen Lawler on Earth .
It 's something that grows in complexity as people use it , and the people use it , and the advantages to increase with use .
Their pictures are hushed with other people .
If you get the idea of contrassigning all these things , and my name , my picture of Notre Damams , suddenly recognized , I can use it as a reich kind of enress , and I can use it as a recognize for immermermers in that space , in that metaphuniverse , using the photographs of anybody else , and have a screen experience of the cross-moes .
Of course , a consequence of all that are virtual models extremely elaborate in every part of the Earth , collective , it 's not just seen vision and satellite images and similar images and similar imagery .
Thank you .
Chris Anderson : I understand ? What your software is you can do you do that is , at some point , in the next few years , all of the next years , all of the world will be able to connect with ?
BAA : Yeah . What he 's doing is basically , it 's discovered .
It 's creating hyperlink , if you want , you 're in images .
And he 's doing it in the basis of the images .
The thing becomes very interesting if you think about wealth of semantement information that many of these images .
As when you make a imagery of images , you get a phrase and the text on the web page has a lot of information about pictures .
Now , what happens if that picture you plays all your pictures ?
So the amount of semantics and the amount of wealth of wealth that 's going to be really enormous . It 's a classic effect .
CA : Blaise , it 's really amazing . Compliments .
BAA : Thank you very much .
One of the main pleasure , when you travels and one of the ethnographics research is the way we have forgotten the antic research , people who have forgotten , the past the wind , you have the past in the wind , you get it on the stone of the plants .
Bastes think the sciamans Jaguar traveling still the Lattea , or that the monites of the old Meange , or Himalayas , or Himalayas , the buddists still fresh the respire of the anthropology of anthropology , and the idea that the world that the world we live in absolute , but it 's just a model of reality , and the idea that the world we live in which we live in absolute , but it is ,
the consequence of a particular set of adaptative choices that our stes did , well , or bad , many generations ago .
And , of course , everybody 's sharing the essential .
We all do . Everybody procreating .
We 're subjects rate .
We need to death inexorability of death , so we don 't surprising us to do it --
We all have an art .
What 's the particular rhythm of the song , the rhythm of every culture .
It doesn 't matter that matter that they are the Penan forests , or the following Vodoo 's the Curch 's Vodoo 's desert Kaisut , Kaisut Saharsut in Kenya settent-harm arm , or a cammar in the Sahara .
He was my journey of journey in desert a month ago , or a alevator of yak in Is , the Everest , the dead mother .
All these people teaching us that there are other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , other ways of moving in the world .
And if you think , you think , it 's a concept that it can give you hope .
And together , together , the myries of the world creating a reverse of the world and cultural life that has the planet and it 's important to the well-being , and it 's important to the well-being of a wealthy .
And you can think of this cultural ragnoise as an etnosphere and you can defining the sum of all the conception of all concepts , dreams , ideas , ideas , inspirations , ideas , intuitions , ideas , inspiration , intuitions ,
The etnosphere is the fantastic patriage of humanity .
It 's the symbol of what we are and what we can be as inquisitive .
And because it was so gravly consumption has been gravly consumed as it happened to the etnosphere and unfortunately .
No biological , for example , it would say that 50 percent , the most apocalyld just because it 's fake , or -- in the most apocalypotesthesis -- in the extra diversity -- in the fields of biological diversity -- and not even even even as well as well as well as well as well as a little optimistic hypothesis -- that of cultural diversity .
The index of all that is , of course , the language loss .
When you were born in this planet .
A language is not just composed by a vocabulary or a series of grammatical rules .
A language is the human spirit .
It 's the half of every culture comes in the material world .
Every language is a forest of mind , a bacin the mind , a thought , a backin , a thought of spiritual possibility .
And those 6,000 languages , as we are here in Monterey , at least half the hasn 't come to Monterey , at least half the hour our ears .
They 're not teaching kids , which means , unless you don 't beat something , which is already dead .
What 's more sad than being you have been flying from the silence , the last is the last to talk a language , the last language , of the sacking of the sagness of the kids ?
This is a faced by someone 's been in some part of the world every two weeks : every two weeks a old mur and door , with them in the tomble of old syllabothic language .
And I know anybody you will say , " is not better .
The world would not be a better place if we talk about all the same language ? " Benissime , then we talk all talk . We talk about South Canonese .
Let 's go kogue .
You 'll be a tract of what it means that we can 't talk about your language .
Today I would like to do a journey through the etnosphere --
a little journey in the etnosphere to give you a asp of what we 're losing .
Many of us forget that when I say , " different ways of existing ways I mean , " I mean , " I mean , " I mean , " different ways of exists .
We take for example this little Barasana , in Amazonia , in Amazonda , who creates the anaconda , creates the myth , creates to come from the river of the waste sacking .
It 's a popular that 's not able to distinguish color from the green because the time it 's identified in the forest , which depends the popular .
They have a strange language and a matrimonial rule , dealing with language .
All that has radical spent in the past mythological , supply is that in these families , in these families , which are talking to six or seven language because of marriage marriage .
They just just just listen to listen and then start talking .
We take one of the most interesting tribe with which I lived , the Waorans of Ecuador nural , a popular popular that has had the first contact in 1958 .
In 1957 missionaries have tried a facing mistake .
They did come down the photographs that they thought they thought they would have admit in , and forest that this population population of pluvial forest , they had never seen anything bi-size .
They pictures the ground , they took the photos , they went to the shape or a shape , and they were killed the five missionaries with the role , and they killed the five missionaries with the liance .
But Waorans don 't kill the foreign .
They killed them .
54 percent of the mortality was caused by themselves .
We 're sitting at eight generations , and we found two natural death and when we 've been born for knowledge , they had a lot of them , they had a lot of them , and then killed it . And then they killed it . And then they killed it . And then they killed it . And then they killed it .
The hunters were able to recognize the animal urine animal urine .
In the early ' 80s , I 've been assigned a really interesting task when my professor of Harvard , I asked , if I wanted to go to Haiti to Haiti to the underlying the potential of Duvalier and Tonton Macody-the-herself , and impossesses of the veil that I used to make the zombies .
To give a sense of miracy , I should have to understand Vodd culture , and the Vodoo 's not magic .
It 's quite a complicated metaphysics of the world .
Very interesting .
If I ask you to tell you the big religions of the world , what would you say ?
Cristianism , Islam , Buddismo , Ebraism , etc . .
A continent is always left out , thinking that sub-Saharan Africa doesn 't have any religious feels . And they do and Vodoo , it 's not the other that the distilside of these religious concepts in the tragic concepts of slavism .
What makes the voodoo is the intended up with life and death .
So , you know , they have to hide the spirits .
The spirits can be invoced by the Great Acqua , they respond to the rhythm of the dance and the temporary of the vial way that for a brive moment , that for a briefly active .
So , for that voodoooists , you go to church with God .
We give them in the temple and we dead God . "
And since you 're married , is the spirit that you drive , how can you do it ?
So you have these incredible events : follow voodoo in the state of trance that touch hits its impunties that touch impunties , which is the power of the mind when it 's catalyzed in a state of extreme .
In all the people I lived the most extraordinary Kogi are the Kogi of Sierra Nevada , in the Sierra Nevada , in the Santa Marta , in the Santa Marta .
It was scending of the ancient civilization that once they lived on the caraibic plus in the conquest , the popular massive planetary massive , the popular massive massive plants .
In a continent macked continent , this people has never been conquisted by Spanize .
And so , they 've got to be an indeed by a clero , but their formation is really extraordinary .
The young people get taken from the families to three or four years , and they live secret in a world that 's made of buy and shadow in the bottom of the ice for 18 years .
Two periods of nine years of proposition for reproduce the nine months of management that spend in the user-months of the mother , they are metaphically in the Grange of Mother .
For all that time , they 're acculturate to the values of their society , values that prey their prayers and only their prayers keep the cosmic balance -- or to say the best balance .
At the term of this amazing began , they have suddenly taken out and for the first time in their 18 years , they see an achievement . And in that moment , they see a hawareness of the first ball , when the sun bacy the value of beautiful , all that they 've learned in theory , all that the recognized , all that the reflies back and says , the predict a pass back and says , the predict does a pass back and says ,
" Where ? I 'm going to say , I said .
It 's wonderful . Now it 's going to protect it . "
They call the major brothers , and they say that we , the minor brothers , we are the destruction of the world .
This level of intuition is extremely important .
When we think about indigenous populations and the environment of the wild Rousseau and the old story of wild , which is a razer concept in his simplicity , which is a razoreau and we say these people are closer .
The indeed population is not not no feelings .
There 's no space for these things in the Asmaller or the winds of the Tibet , but thank you for the time and the ran , they created a mystic of the Earth has no idea of the Earth can only live because it 's not about the concept of human consciously aware : the concept that the Earth can live only can live because it 's infused by human consciousness .
What does it mean ?
It means that a kid of Ande who grows up the mountain that the mountain is a spiririt of Apu who will leave his destiny , and will have a human being different human being a deeply different , and it will have a very different relationship with the mountain that the mountain grow of a Montana is grows that a mountain is that it 's a large mass of rocks .
That 's the demadd of a mineral cuts is irrelevant .
What 's interesting is the metaphor that defines the relationship between the individual and the natural world .
I grew up in the forests of the Columbia credying that forests were cut .
So , that made me a human being different from my friends Kwakiutl who believe that the forests are the Hamkuk and the bare the historical dise and the bare the ski 's historical dead , who are living in the world , becomes behind the Hamatsa 's began with the Hamatsa .
If you start looking at these cultures can create different reality , you can create different reality , you can start to understand some sense of their sensational discoveries .
I took this picture to the april in the nordoctor .
Mayahuass , some of you have heard about ayahuass , the most powerful substance of the chievement of the chievement of the chievement .
What makes makes it fascinating the ayahuass is not the potential potential of the substance , but his elaboration . It 's composal by two elements .
On one side , this liana launch that has a series of beta-carboline , harmolines , harmolines , harmolines .
Taking the only plants , it has a smoke blumb , and it 's a little bit the consciousness , but it 's measured with leaves of a coffee family , Psychoc said Psychothy .
This plant is a lot of tripptamine-5 , very similar to serotonin , dimethyltryptamine-5 , methoxtamine-deed .
If you ever see Yanomami you 'll see Yanomamamamamine the nose that they do a different set of species , it 's a methoxtamine .
Tiring that pounds like to be shoot , as you 're shown by a carric fucile , and landed on a sea of electricity . [ Risoning ] . Don 't create a demand the reality . It creates the dissolution of reality .
I was often with my professor , I was a very often with my professor , the man who has taken the psychic , with his discovery of the fungi that was psychic , with his discovery in the 1930s in Mexico .
And I think , you can 't get these tripptamines as hallucinogens because if you can 't tell anybody to be hallucinated . And the tripal , they can 't be hallucinated . And the tripamine , they can 't be asking a hore-hatheist , called , and it 's obviously , it 's called the monoamine-hases .
It 's possible to be able to assume , if they 're assume with other chemicals that you know , the MAO .
Now , it 's the beautiful : Is that are in this liana is inhibited in this lian unlike , the same type of necessary to potential tripal , the same kind of necessary spontaneous spontaneous , like these people who are two morogically not like these people who are two morogically not like that , but that if you combinate in this way , create a biochemical superior to the sum of the sum of the sum of the sum of the sum of the sum of the sum of the parts ?
We use the great eat proof the proof the error and the mistake , which can reveal it is .
But if you ask the Indians , they 'll say , " The plants are talking to us . "
What does it mean ?
This tribes , Cofan , has 17 varieties of ayahuasks , who are born in the forest , and our eyes would reach into the same species .
If you ask them as they 'll be they 'll tell them , " I thought , I was thinking , " I thought , I was thinking about it , " I said , " No . "
The solution is : they take the 17 varieties in a night and each one will sing with a little bit and each of a little bit .
With this doesn 't fall to Harvard , but it 's much more interesting than contact the stams .
Now , [ applaushing ] the problem is that even the people of us who have heart people in their own heart people are paintings , but somehow redots to the margins of the history of our real world , and pass beyond .
In fact , 300 years , it 's not going to be reminded of his gueres or innovations , but rather as the one was where we stopped and the fact that we stopped and actively accepted , or accepted passionately , the destruction of the diversity and cultural diversity and cultural cultural diversity of the planet . Now the problem is not the change .
All cultures through the centuries have been involved in a dance for new lifetime .
And the problem is not technology .
The Indians Sioux have no stopped to be Sioux when they put in and they reach as as Americans have no Americans , when they put in the horse and calving .
It 's not the change or technology that threatened the integrity of the etnosphere . It 's the power .
The flight flight flight .
And if you give a look at the world , you 'll find that these are not destinated cultures .
They 're living creatures and dynamics are living out of identificable forces that go beyonic existence that go beyond their ability .
I know that you have to be tracks in Penan --

If we move on the mountains of Tibet , where I 'm doing many research , you 'll see the hard flight flight flight flight .
As you know the genocide , the physics of a popular , is convicted at the level , but the ethnocide , the destruction of a popular lifetnocide , not only has not convicted , but advertising cracks , because it makes a part of the development .
And you can 't understand the suffering of Tibet until you get from the beginning .
I 've been paid the 6,000 miles from Chengdu in Chengcial China through the Soriental Cologist , coming in Lhasa with a young link , but only came to Lhasa , I realized what 's behind the statistics we feel about .
6,000 sacred sacred sacres in popolust and cuts .
1.2 million people killed by military during the Cultural Revolution .
The father of this guy was ascriticized at Panchen Lama .
That means that it was killed the temple of the Chinese invasion .

One day he inavailable to calculate a raffigant Mao and , for this transgression , was put on the work for seven years .
The Tibet of Tibet can be inbehind , but the spirit of the people 's popular is from the tener present .
And then , all of them reduces a choice .
We want to live in the monoonia , or we want to accopy the world policy or we want to accommodity ?
The great anthropologists Margaret Mead , before he died , he said , his bigger fear was that , in our way to go to this advance , not only we 'll see the whole range of human imagination reduced to a limited day we 'll get us from a very limited day we 'll get us from a very limited day we 'll get us from a slead , and we 're going to wake up from other possibility .
And it 's umillion people remember that our species is in 600,000 years .
The Neolitic Rvolution , who gave us the agriculture , who did us socked us to subject seed the seed of the chiaming of the chiamp with the probe of the clergate , creating the hierarchy of specialization , and we talk about 10,000 years ago .
The modern industrialized world has 300 years .
That 's a story is not suggests that we have the answers that we have to do with all the challenges that we 're going to have to face in the millennia to come .
When you get these myriades of cultures of the world , they 're asked about 10,000 different voices .
And it 's in these answers that we all have the possibility of being what we are : a kind of consciousness , it has to make all the people and all the gardens can fight . And there 's great moments .
I took this picture on the northern extremity of the island of Baffin the island of the Inuit , and this man , Olaya , Olaya , and this man , Olaya , and he told me the wonderful story of his grandfather .
The canadd government has been not always gentle with the Inuit 's popular . And in the 1950s to stabilize our supremirrrate .
The grandfather of this man refused to go .
The family , I teach her life , took them all the way , and all his attitudes .
You have to know that Inuit doesn 't teach the freeze , they exploit .
The packs in the origin were made of fish .
The grandfather of this man didn 't make it up from the night or the library of the library .
It 's sgattaitholled , it 's calcated the pads in the skin and defecated in their hand . When I did I made them , they 've been a blow , they worked a lama .

It took a slead , and he made a brighter , with the hacic cass has created a slead , and he imbridge , and he imbridge the bled , hell the cracks of the caccess to the hell , he took a hell , hell the cracks in the back .
We want to talk about cavarself-f-popular with nothing ? [ Risate . And this , in different ways , [ Applaushed is the symbol of the resilience of the Inuit and all the popular popular people in the world .
In the aprile 1999 , the California government has reached the total control of an area of the bigger territory of California and Texas I put together .
It 's the new chorry . It 's called Nunut .
It 's an independent territory . They 're going to get all the mineraries .

And , to finish , I think it 's quite obvious at least that we have been in these remote zones of the planet , realizing that they 're not going to be very very very very very very much .

Thank you .
I 'm going to talk about some things I 've written in this book that I hope I 'll be refused to prove some links , in the case , you didn 't notice them .
I want to start with what I call the dogma official dogma .
The official dogma official doggloves ?
The official dogma of all the Western society , the western official dogma , " If we want to massixize the well-being of our citizens . " "
The reason is , from one side , in fact that freedom is in itself a value , it 's very precious , essential for human beings .
On the other is that if we are free , each of us can act for just doing it for all that massive to do , not no one that you decide .
The way to massive massive freedom is massimilar choice .
More choices people have , the more they are free , and more and more is their bends , more , the more and more is their benth .
This , I think , it 's so deeply radicated in society that nobody would dream to put it in doubt .
And it 's also rooted in our lives .
I 'm going to show you some examples of what progress has made possible .
This is my supermarket . It 's not particularly big .
I 'm permission a simple note on the winds .
In my supermarket , there are 175 conditions , without content the 10 variety of oil extrave them , and the 12 covers that you can buy for a huge amount of conditions in the incbreaker that nobody of 175 proning is your degree .
That 's how the supermarket .
Then you go to the electronic store to buy a store : casse , you know , CD , radio , plastic , plastic , the lower .
And in this single cracy , there 's a great number of components .
We can do six and a half million different combinations , using the components that there are only one store .
You have to admit that 's a lot of choice .
And some fields : the world of communications .
Once , when I was a kid , they could get all the phone services , and they were forniteous and dealt .
It was going to get the phone , you didn 't buy it .
One of that , the phone was that the phone never break .
These days are gone .
We now have a variety of telephones , especially between mobile phone .
Here 's the cell phone .
My favorite is in the middle lector MP3 , cut it out of ose , and foreign to the sound of brulele .
If you haven 't seen it yet in the store under the house , you 're pretty much certainly going to get .
And what happens is that people come in in the stops and they do this question . And you know , what 's the answer is , " No . " No . "
It 's not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn 't do too much .
So , in other aspects of life that are much more important than the aquists , it 's the same brought the same choices .
Axxistence : It doesn 't happen to be the United States that you go from the doctor and the doctor 's the doctor , you have to do .
And instead , you go to the doctor , and the doctor says , " OK , we could do A , or B , " A has these benefits and these landers . What do you want to do ? "
You say , " Dotor , what would I do ? "
And the doctor says , " A has these benefits and these risk , and you have these benefits and you have these benefits . "
" What do you want to do ? "
And you say , " Dotor if she was me , what would you do ? "
And the doctor : " But I 'm not . "
The result of the result of the mality , " " expression that makes it look like a beautiful thing .
But it 's not a deployed , and the responsibility of taking decisions decisions , which is the doctor , to someone else else knows , and almost certainly , and nearly certainly , it 's not bad -- and so not in the state of the ideal condition to take decisions .
There 's a huge marketing products , you know , it 's direct to people like me and you , that if you think , it 's not a sense , because you can 't buy them .
But if we can 't buy them , why do you get them ?
The answer is that they want you to give it a domorning we call the doctor to ask them to change the recicipe .
And that 's so fundamental as our identity is our own own identity is a question of choice , as you see in this jycles . They 're going to get their sex . They are going to be able to invent . " We don 't recognize the right time . " We don 't need to invent it .
And we can reinvent us how many times we do it .
That means that every morning , at the risk , you have to decide that kind of person want to be .
I think about family and marriage , a time perspective , a time perspective , it was that you marriage , it was that you were married to have the most soon possible , and it was starts to make the most soon possible .
The only real choice was with who , not when , and not even what do after .
Ose it , it 's really to play .
I teach students very smart , and I do 20 percent less than a time .
And it 's not because they are good , not because they are less diligent .
but why are I impensieres , I mean , I would you marry or not ? I should get married or not ? I should do it now ? "
" Do I would married later ? I have to think before or career ? "
They 're interrogative .
And they try to answer these questions , even though this implessons don 't complete the companies that I 'm sign and not getting a bel vote to my examples .
And they really have to do it . They 're important questions .
Now , the work : we 're lucky , like Carl underolyer , because technology allows us to work every minute , every day , from every day , from every day , from every day , from every day Hotel Randolph .
In the parenth , there 's a corner , and I didn 't tell anybody what , where the WiFi works .
I don 't tell you , because I want to use it .
What does this mean , this amazing choice that we have about work ? It 's that we have to continue , and we have to work , and not .
We can go to see our son playing hot , with the cell phone , the Blackberry in the other , and the notebook , type , behind the knees .
And even though they 're all spent , every minute that we see our son ruining the game , we 're also asking this , " Did you know , I 've got this called ? "
" Did I have to answer this email ? I have to abbozzy this letter ? "
And even when the answer is " no , all this makes the experience of your child 's game , very different than what would be in other conditions .
So , anywhere we look , little things , big and big things , big , materials and life is a question of choice .
Once the world was this : Of , there were some possibility , but it was not a question of choice .
The world of today looks like this : The dilemma is , " Is it positive , or negative ? "
The answer is Sologist .
The positive latest bags we all know , so I 'm going to talk about the negative ones .
All this choice is two negative effects on people .
The first , the first , is that it makes paralalisis that it makes a freezation .
With many many options between which choosing , it becomes very difficult to do it .
I give you an example : a conduct for a flap on flap .
A plug in my colleague has had access to the Vanguard data , the giant source society , with about a million employees in 2,000 different companies .
What she found is that for every 10 solutions that are offered in more , the percentage of them , the lower of them , two percent .
With 50 offer-founds , there 's 10 percent in less than adhhesions than only five . Why ?
Because with 50 fources between which choosing , is maledtely difficult to decide , and choice is remained to ask tomorrow .
And I think about tomorrow , and I think , tomorrow , and , of course , the tomorrow 's never coming .
You know , it doesn 't mean that just means that these work from the old work , because they don 't have enough money , they want to say that decision is so so ostic that lose the decision is so so ostic that lose the funds of work .
They 're not participating , they 're losing up to five thousand dollars per year from work , which would be very much worth .
So , the paralalisis is a consequence of the trouble .
And I think it makes the world that 's like that .
" Do you end , for ethernity : ketchup , sens or Manange ? "
You would like to take the right decision , if it 's for ethernity , right ?
You don 't want to choose the wrong background , and neither the wrong condition .
So this is the first effect . The second is that even though we can avoid paralaliis and make a choice , we 're less soddisfacts from the result of the result of how we had been with less options that choose .
And that 's a different reasons .
One of these is that with many conditions that you choose , you buy one , and it 's not quite perfect , it 's easy to imagine that you could have been a different choice that would have been better . And what happens is that the alternative imagined us would be better . And what happens is that the alternative imagination , and the reflect the sodden , and the reflect the soddisfenried of the rest , and the repair decreased ,
even when it was a good decision .
More choices are , it 's easier to displeased than any detail that is unsound that it 's unsound of choice .
And also , there 's what economists call expensive opportunity .
Dan Gilbert has really clear , like the value that we give things to things that we 're conflicting with .
And the rest , when there are many options , it 's easy to represent features of the alternative arm and be less sodden facts of the option that you have .
So , here 's an example . I 've all been a lot of New York .
But that 's what you probably think you 're probably going .
There 's this copy to Hamptons .
A lift place .
It 's all about splendida . Ot-the day day . It 's all about them .
It 's nothing . But what he thinks is , " Well , males , the other people , it 's Agosia . "
" All my own neighbors are away . "
" I could talk about giving them right in front of the house . "
And it goes two weeks I 've been brought by losing -- every day -- every day -- the possibility of parking where he wants .
The constoopportunity decreases the resdatisfaction for what we have , even when choice was excellent .
And the most are the options that we have to look , the more the attractive attractive characteristics will come up with how to make it cost .
Here 's another example .
This is telling us a lot of things .
It 's about living the time , and perhaps in live slowly .
But the most important point is that anything you 're choose , you get down to do ,
The things that we don 't choose to be a lot of attractive that can make less attractive what we do .
Third point : spiral growing of expectations .
I tried it on my skin buying a new jeans .
I 'll be like jeans .
Once the jeans were just like a guy , they were just like , buying them and flew from , they were just forced , just after having a lifted lip of time , they were starts to go well .
So I went to buy a couple of people when the old people went , and I said , " I need to have a couple of jeans , this is my cut . "
The committed me said , " Look , " Look , fit , the relationship axed ? "
Do you want to do it with the cerniera ? "
" Do you like it looks like ? "
" Do you want to get them or stretch ? Bla bla bla -- " Continuated to elenlie .
I was sbalord , and after a little bit , I was able to say , " I want to know , who was the only guy , so for a time , I tried to all the jeans , and I did it by a little bit of the negoal , I , I gave the best ones , I 've got to say , " I want to do it . "
It was the massive . With all that I had the best .
But I felt out worse .
Why ? I 've written a whole book .
The reason I was worse is that with all that choice is that with all my expectations were high , jeans had to be perfect .
I was at the beginning of my own own own own . I didn 't expect to do anything about it , but when it was 100 different steps , at least , steps , at least , steps , at least one guy had to be perfect .
What I was brought was good , but not perfect .
After I had a chosen that I was going to try to do it in the confronted expectations .
The add of options in life is not that increasing the expectations that these have respect to excellence .
And this will be less soddisfacation , even when the results are good .
No one in the world of marketing , they realized .
Because if they knew , you didn 't know what I 'm talking about .
The truth looks more like this .
" It was better when it was worse . " The reason he was better when it was worse was that when he was worst , when it was worst , and it was still possible to meet surprised .
Ose the world that we live in -- opulents , industrialized citizens , industrialized citizens with expectancy , the massive that we can hope is that things are at the altituative .
You never surprised pleasant surprised because your expectations , my expectations , they 're ingiant .
The secret of happiness -- what you 're here -- it 's , " Baxis , " Yes , " Yes , " Yes , " Yes , " Yes , " Yes , " Yes , " Yes , " Yes , " Yes , " is expectations . "
I mean , little high-wheographic -- which I really married and my wife is really wonderful .
I couldn 't do better , I didn 't have been content .
But it 's not always a bad thing .
And finally , a consequence of buy a couple of jeans is that when you 're just like this jeans is that when you 're not satisfacts , and ask you , " Why ? "
" Who is responsible ? "
The world is responsible . What could you do you ?
When there are hundreds of types of jeans , and you buy a insophister , and ask you who is the responsible , it 's the clear , it 's the clear that responsible you .
You could do better .
With hundreds of varieties have , there are not excuses , they have been taken for insuccess .
So when people get decisions , even though the result is valid , they 're just feeling and they damn the same .
In the last few years , depression is exploded in the industrialized world .
I think that a meant factor -- not the only one , but important -- of this depression of depression is that people have a dollar experiences because they 're standards , because they 're standards too high .
And when they have to explain this situation , they think that the colence is .
So the final result is that we 're general , objectively , but we feel worse .
Let me remember you .
This is the official dogma , what we all take for good and it 's completely fake . It 's not true .
There 's no doubt that a little bit of choice is better than they don 't have any good at all , but from this doesn 't happen that much better than a little bit .
There 's a critical value , magic . I don 't know what it is .
But I 'm sure that we 've been quite sure that we 've been doing this for a piece of choices .
Now , from the political point of view -- I almost finished , from political point , the pele is the following .
What allows this whole choice in industrial society is the material result .
There are many places in the world , and you know , you know , where the problem is not that they have a choice .
The problem is they have too pop .
So the factory I 'm talking about is a malbeing exclusive to be exclusive , revenue society .
And what makes you depress and array is this : Steve Levitt Levitt . And he talked about yesterday of these expensive and seats . It 's a sprec .
I mean , these choices , complicated and complicated avdious and avdies , it 's not just useful .
I 'm very deleteries .
They make us worse .
If a little bit of what in our society in our society allows , they were reversed in those where people have too few possibility , it would not just have their life to improve but our own life .
This is what economists call a paretian improvement improvement .
A redistribution re-distribution re-distribution re-distributed choice in excess , and it 's going to us .
So , to end up , " You can become everything you want " --
You , people , culture , you think , " What 's it creds ? "
" It 's obvious that you can 't make anything in a glass box . "
" A castrated vision , a limited vision --
and I 'm going to have a whole thing that I 've been interpreted that , at the beginning .
But then , thinking , instead , I realized that that the fish knows the long .
Because the reality is that if you saves in the bottle , so that , " all , " you can 't get the freedom . You get the paralalisis .
If you break the bottle in a way that all the decreases possible defense .
You get the paralalisis , and you reduced the benefit .
Everybody needs a sphere .
This is almost certainly too closely , perhaps even for the fish , and certainly sure we .
But the absence of a few symbolic symbolic symbolic symboll and , for the ruin .
Thank you very much .
