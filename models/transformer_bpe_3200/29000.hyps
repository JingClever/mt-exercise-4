Last year I showed these slides to show that the glacial calculottical calculations , which for almost three million years , which is about 48 dimensions of the size of 48 continental , is about 40 percent .
But this subvalue the gravity of the problem because it doesn 't show the spreading of the ice .
The glacial calottical calculations is , in a sense , the clean , the heart of the global climate system .
You expanies winter and you get ritira .
The next slide will be a rapid carlated on to the last 25 years .
Places are taken in red .
You can see , they expand until blue wall .
That 's the ice in the winter , which is extreme of the summer .
You can see that the cosidg-in-year-old ice , is like blood , which is like blood , which here is from the body .
And in 25 years , it 's been there .
This is a problem because the rescale of the interest , the ice heat the ocean , where there are enormous amount of carbon congle , which is , the melated , and they 're transformed in the microbes .
I think I think about the totality of the pollution , the amount of global warming could be doppied , overwhelming this point in the point .
In some some laghi , in Alaska , which is already rebling out of the water .
The professor Katey Walter in the University of Alaska was a team that was a bull last bull .
Video : Wow ! Al Gore : Wow ! Al Gore : If we 're going to be .
One reason is that this is that the thermal environment restation from the northern North .
This is a river river of glacial regime .
The landed never reached levels .
This is the Kangerlussuaq , in the southwest of the Groenland .
If you want to know how the sal leaving the ice level of the ice of the glacs on the ground .
These current current are to fast .
At the other side of the planet : Antarctica , the largest block of the planet .
The last month scientists have dichieve that the bilanxion is in the negative , and that the Western Antarctica , which is very rapid in some islands , is particularly very rapid in the month .
It 's six feet of the two-foot of the sea level of the bottom , like Groenland .
Sulil Himalaya , the third largest block of ice , you see new laghi , which a few years ago , a few years ago ,
40 percent of the world population is half of the world population half of the water from that leavailable .
Sulle Ande : this glacier is the source of the water source of this city .
The luck is increased .
But when he diminule is the same thing happens to the water .
In California , the snow on Sierra Nevada is about 40 percent .
Our kiss are in crisis .
From , as you 've been reading , they 're pretty good .
Salf cence in the world leads to a remarkable auction .
The environmental disaster disaster , are increasing out of the normal and without precedented .
Four more numerous numbers in the last 30 years than precedented 75 .
This is a whole insustainable .
If you look at the context , you can see the context .
In the last five years we 've added 70 million tons of CO2 every 24 hours -- 25 million tons of tons in the ocean every day .
Look at the Eastern area of the Eastern Pacific , and on both parts of the parts of the oxygen , where there is a radical radical imor the oceans .
The major cause of global warming , together deforestation , which is 20 percent of them , is the fossil fuels .
Of the oil is a problem , and the carbon is even worse .
The United States is one of the two more emissions , together to China .
And it proposing to build many other cents in carbon .
But we 're seeing a direction of the direction .
These are the anullated projects in the last few years and some green proposes of alternative .
Everything is a political fight in our country .
The carbon industry and the oil industry have spent 250 million dollars in the last year to promote carbon , which is a oxymous .
That image , I remembered to something --
Serice , in the Tennessee , where I live , there was a 3.8 billion lifeters of carbon lifeters .
Maybe you saw on news .
This is the second largest flow of last flow in America .
It happened around Natal .
The publicity of one of the carbon industry was this .
Video : Sissues . It 's a kind of allegro and happy .
It 's abundant here in America , and it will grow our economy .
Froy the carbon is more and cleaner .
It 's good price , adorable and the work is keep the deal .
Al Gore : So , here 's a lot of the West Virginia .
The biggest mineral mineral society on the mountain . This is his administrator .
Video : Don Blankenship : I 'll be a money -- Al Gore , Nancy Pelosy Pelosy , Harry Really -- -- they don 't know what they 're talking about .
Al Gore : So the Alleance for the Clima Protext has two campaign .
This is a thing of them , a part .
Video : Acore : Acore : Acy COALergy , as a serious serious threat our business .
So , our priority is to invest a lot of money in a effort to make public and confused the truth of the carbon .
In fact , carbon is not sports .
We think it 's cleaning -- it 's also a good profuel .
So , not preocupatch of climate change .
Let me do it .
Video : Clian : Carbone -- you 've heard a lot of speak a lot of .
So , let 's take a turn into a structure to the horrise .
Straordinary ! The machines are a little rain , but this is the sound of the carbon technology .
The carbon consumption is between the main causes of global warming , but the remarkable technology of carbon that you see changes everything .
You look at a look . This is the pul-lit technology .
Al Gore : Finally , the positive alternative of the economic issues and the national safety .
Video : The economy , America is in crisis ; the economy , the national security crisis .
The file that connects all : our dependence from fossil fuel , like the sports of fossil fuel , and the oil imports .
Now , though , there 's a new , audace , solution to use .
Repower : 100 percent of clean energy , in 10 years .
A plan to re-based plan America to work , make sure more , and help stop the global warming .
Finally , a solution that behind our problems .
Repower . You 're more .
Al Gore : This is the last one .
Video : It 's about re-to re-energy energy .
One of the fastest ways to bring the dependence to dependence by the combustible that killing our planet .
So , the future is here . Sun is here . Sun , a new web .
Compars number number two : Novi investment for jobs for jobs .
Comment : Repower America . It 's time to be realists .
Al Gore : A old proverbio African proverbio says , " If you want to go fast , go to the one .
If you want to go away , you go together . "
We have to go away , fast .
Thank you very much .
Last year at TED , I introducing a LHC .
And promise to return on on how the machine works .
So here I 'm here . And for those that other time , the other time , the LHC is the biggest scientific experiment ever trial -- 27 kilometers of circumster-six-dollar .
His task is to rerereturn the conditions that were present less than a billion of a second from the beginning of the universe -- to 600 million times a second .
And all that 's just ambiitious .
This is the machine in the Ginevra .
We do these min-Big Bang in the detectors .
This is what I work on . It 's called ATLAS -- is 44 meters and has a 22 foot .
This is a spectacular picture of ATLAS , built so you can see the proportions .
Totember last year , we have accesum the first time .
And this picture was taken by ATLAS .
It was because of immense festeggams in in control .
It 's a picture of the first particles that made all the place in the LHC , entering in collision , deliberately , with a part of the LHC , and spread particles into the detector .
In other words , when we saw that image 10 to september the machine was working , which is a great writory .
I don 't know if it was this to exultar us more or this , when somebody went on on Google and saw the page was this .
That means that we had a cultural impact beyond to the scientific impact .
About a week later , there was a problem with the machine , just to these things here -- these files here -- these dor-dor-day .
These file 13,000 amps when the machine works in the massive power .
Now , the technical technical technical .
And they can do it because when they 're very coxed by the way , they get the superconvices .
So at least 271 degrees , in a nuror temperature on the space between stars , these files can bring that right .
In one of the giunture of the most notices in the LHC , there was a defect of the factory .
So the files , they surrounded a slightly , and the 13,000 suddenly met a electrical resistance .
This was the result .
Now , this is more impressive if you think that these magneti fish magneti fish more than 20 tons , and that have been moved about 30 centimeters .
They were damaged about 50 magneti magneti .
We had to take them , what we did .
We restinated them and enaged .
They are now return all to their place underground .
By the end of march the LHC is will be back back to the LHC is will be integral .
We 're going to access it , and we expect to get data or the bunch or the bunch or to see what are the morning that we 're constitude to find out what are the morons that are the universe .
Now , of course , in a certain way , these accidents reacting the debate of science and the engineering in the value of science and engineering in the front . It 's easy to conviction .
I think the fact that it 's so hard , the fact that I think that 's the value of things like LHC .
I want to end with the words of a English scientist , Humphrey Davy , which , imagine , in defense of inuseful experiments of the unuseful experiments of his pupille , he said , " Nient is so dangerous for the progress of the human mind as the re-human mind as the re-as the re-inusually , that we don 't have any any new , as a conflict . "
Thank you .
I want to start asking you about rethink of when , as children , you play cocococoon moroning .
As you can understand how to reach and make them , get them and move them , and learn them , you know , and you can actually think and solve problems , and manipulating space relationships .
The space reasoning is deeply connected to the way we understand a lot of the world around us .
So , from information usually use of physical objects , together to my physical objects , together to my physical Pcap , and my collaborator Kalanithi , I started to ask , " And if , when we use a computer , instead of having the only cursor of the mouse like polystrer 's typical boat that moves on a desktop , we could deal with a desktop , with both hands ,
and how do it to our please ?
The question was so interesting that we decided we could explore the answer , building Siftable .
In a few words , a Siftable interactive is a great interactive computer .
In a few words , a Siftable interactive is a great interactive computer .
You can move with their hand , can " see " between them , " and they can be able to see their movement and they have a screen and a wireless .
But basically , they are physical objects like the morning , as the morning , you can just be mistake .
Siftable is the example of a new ecosystem tools to manipulate information .
And as they become more physical , knows of movement , of others , and as they become more physical , consciousness of the movement , of how we movement , we can explore new and fun and fun and fun of interaction .
I 'm going to start with some simple example .
This Siftable is configured to show the video : if it 's in a direction , the video is going to be like this , if you 're going to stop it .
These interactive ractive ractive rators .
If I ran them , they 're interested in what they 're around .
If they 're surrounded , they can see it , and they can be a little bit .
If they 're surrounded , they can see it , and they can be a little bit .
They also have their movement and inclination .
We then realized that one of the most implications of the interaction was to use common management , for example , to say , " a color like a liquid .
In this case , we have three Siftable configuration as a buckers , and I can use them to versate the cental color , where they mix .
and I can use them to fix the color in the center , where they mix .
We can actually put a little bit in a place .
There are also beautiful possibility of learning , like language , like language , the mathematics , and mathematics , where people can try to try things very quickly , and see the results immediately .
I 'm now --
This is a Recency Ribonaccount that I do with a program of equations .
Here we have a words game in the half of the words of Scarabean and Boggle .
Pratically , at every turnal , you get a letter to every Siftable , Pratically , every turnal you get a letter in case on every Siftable , and when you look for a dictionary .
And then , after about 30 seconds remix , and you have a new letters and new possibilities to try .
Thank you .
Here 's here to the children come to the Media Lab , I made it so I tried to go and I went to a video .
They are very pleased .
And one of the interesting things like this kind of application is that you don 't have to give people many education .
You 've got to say , " Compons of words , and they know exactly what to do .
Here 's here to other people who try it .
This is our younger tester tester than , there on the right .
It was actually wanted to impilling them .
They were only moroncles , for him .
Now , this is a application of a interactive cartoon .
We wanted to build a tool for the apprenticing of Lui is Felix .
It can put new characters in the scene , lifetime , and you can sit the Siftable .
It can put new characters in the scene , lifetime , and you can sit the Siftable .
So , it 's doing the sun out .
Video : The smile is smile .
David Merrill : Now it 's now a herrill in the scene .
Video : The horange horange .
Bel work ! Yeah !
So , you know , the Siftable and put them close to interact with the characters --
Video : Bau !
-- by inventing your story .
Video : Hi !
DM : It 's a story with the open , and it can decide him like .
DM : It 's a story with the open , and it can decide him like .
Video : Fola , throat .
DM : The last example I have time to show you is a tool , which is a recently made , to sample and execececture .
It 's a tool , recently recently , to tramp and exeguing music .
Siftable here , the Siftable here , the bacteria .
Each one of these has four different variations , and you can choose that use .
And you can also insert these sound in a sequence to be able to be able to be .
And then , just to move a sun-like sound and a sequence .
These are actually actually , you can control from the live , like reverbage and the filter .
You attacks to a particular sound and then fix sitting on .
And then there are the general effective , as time and volume , that they 're going to be able to the entire sequence .
Let 's look at how it works .
Video : We 're going to start making a base in two Siftable sequence , we 're going to be a series , we can add the other base .
Now I put a basis line .
Video : I add of the percussions --
Video : And now I 'm going to put the bacteria , so I can control the effect from the live .
Video : I can be able to be able to be able to kill the entire sequence time on the other .
Video : And now I 'm going to add the bottom filter to give more expression .
Video : I can recombine the sequence " to flight . "
So I don 't have to plan it before , but I can improvise , make it longer or .
And now , finally , I can spend the whole sequence on the left Siftable .
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is to build new most-machine interfaces and more and more sounds like how our brain work and body .
And today , I 've had time to show you one of the results of this path , and also some chance we try to bring out of the lab .
The concept I want to transmit is that it 's coming to this new generation of designed objects to interact with digital media , that will bring information in our world in the way we want .
Thank you very much .
I don 't see the hour with you .
I 'm a writer .
I 'm going to claw is my profession , but it 's more than this , of course .
It 's also love and the fashion of my life .
And I don 't expect that to change .
But , said , something particularly , something particularly in my life and my career , which led me to return the entire portion with this work .
The particular thing is that I recently written this book , this biography called " Mangia , " The thing , diversally from my precedented books , for some reason out in the world and became a big , , bestseller , and the interational , bestseller .
And the result is that everywhere , people treat me as if I were convicted .
It 's true -- convicted , convicted .
They are now all worried and say , " You don 't have afraid to do it more ?
You don 't have fear to continue to write the whole life without being able to create a book that can important book that can important to someone ? "
that can be importantly to someone ? "
It 's resure , you know .
But it could go worse , at the end , I remember that more than 20 years ago , when I started to say to people -- I was a writer .
I would go to the same reaction based on the fear .
And people said , " Don 't I have a success to me ?
You don 't have fear that the humiliation of refuse you ?
You don 't have fear to do this whole life without anything about it . It 's ever out and dying on a cue of dreaming with a mouth of dreaming with the blood cut . "
So , you know .
The answer -- the short answer to all these questions is , " Yes . "
Yeah , I 'm afraid of all those things .
I 've always been fear .
And I also have many other things that people can 't inguguess .
Like the algaand other frightening things .
But , as much about the writing what I thought and I would ask a last multily is that ?
Is it rational ?
It 's logical that anyone who has to wait to be spended by a job that you 've been born to do .
But what is this particular , in the business , creative provide of nervous health is to the mental health of a way that other carrier , in a way that other carrier , not they do ?
How my father , for example , he was a chemist engineer and I don 't remember one time in his 40 years of activity that was asked if he was supposed to be engineer ?
It never was there -- that block of the John engineer John , how ?
It wasn 't working so , you know ?
Onestly , chemicals like group don 't have certainly , in the centuries , wardly , in the centulized reputation of depressive .
We have a writers , we have enough to do this reputation , and not just writers , but you have this reputation of being enormously unstable .
And it 's not to look at the sad , the sad of the magnifications of the magnificments that , only in the 21st century , they die young and often .
And those who are not suicidata seem to be really unusually disfacing .
Norman Mailer , before I die , in the last interview , in the last interview , " Whenabled me a little more more " an extraordinary affermation about the work of your life .
But we don 't do the bat when we heard of these things so long that we 've been so much interiorized and accepted the notion that creativity and suffering is in some way we read and the art , at the end .
And the question I want to bring to all here today is , are you all this .
It 's good to you this -- because it 's also about a centimeter of distance to me not good for this support .
I think it 's hate .
And I think it 's dangerous and I don 't want to see the perpetuated in the next century .
I think it 's better to encourage our big creative minds .
And I susurely , in my case -- in my situation -- it would be very dangerous to start sitting towards that suppointing the circumstances in my career .
It 's very much about 40 . I 'm pretty young , I have about 40 years .
I have about four decades of work in me .
And it 's very likely that everything I 'm going to be right now to be right now to be right by the world like the work that came out after the success of my last book .
I 'm going to be slaughter because we are all more of my own behind .
Oh , Gesus , I think .
You know this is the kind of thought that leads a person to start to drink in the morning and I don 't want to do it .
I would keep doing this work that I love .
So , the question becomes , how ?
And so it seems to me , after many reflective , which is to do to keep write is to create a psychological construction , OK ?
I have to find a safety distance of safety , I 'm writing , and my natural anxial anxial , which is going to be able to see if they could have to do it , and I was trying to find other society to see if they could have more and more healthy ideas and see if they could have more and more healthest ideas and sane and more healthy healthy and sane .
about how to help people make the inerent risks of the inerent risks of creativity .
And that research led me to the ancient Grek and ancient Rome .
Heguitem , because I 'm going to go back .
In the ancient Grek and ancient Rome -- people didn 't seem to believe that creativity self-sold , OK ?
And it was thinking about creativity was this review , they would look at the men , and that come to the men from some source distant , for reasons and unknown , for distant reasons and unknown .
The Great greats called these spiritual divine demon .
Socrate , wonderful , wonderful , believed to have a helargift that was remote sagency from remote .
The Roands were the same idea , but they called the " spirit species . "
That 's great , because Roands didn 't really think that a genius was somebody who was particularly intelligent .
They thought that a genius was this sort of divine entity that was literally in the walls of a artist , a little bit like the elpho Dobby , and that come out of hidden the job of the artist and models the result of the artist and modeled the resulof that work .
Exxx--- here is the distance of which I talk about the psychological construction that psychological constructions from your work .
And everybody knew that was how it worked , right ?
So the anti-artists were protected by certain things , like , for example , too much too narcible , right ?
If your work was exceptional , you could not take all the deserve , all of you know that you 've been helped by this incorporate genius .
If your failed work , it was not all your failing , right ?
Everybody knew that was your genius to be a inable .
And so people han conceived creativity in Occient for a long time .
And then the Renciement came up and all this big idea , and we can put the human center of the universe above all the mysteries and no more leaving space creatures and no longer space creatures that wrote from divinity .
This was the principle of the rational rational , and people started thinking about creativity , and people started thinking about creativity , and completely from the idivide .
And for the first time in history , you start to refer to this or one person in a rather than a person in the genius , like a rather than a person in the genius .
And I have to say , I think it was a big mistake .
I think I let someone , a simple person to believe that that is like a recipient like source , the essence and source of all the mysteries , creativity and inknowable and ssource is a very big file to give to the fragile .
It 's like to ask someone to enjoy the sun .
It 's a dem-and distores all these inextraordinary ingestishes .
And I think it was this pressure that I 've been destroyed to 500 years .
And , if this is true , and I think it 's , the question becomes , and now ?
Can we do it ?
Maybe I can go back to a more comprehanent understanding of the relationship between humans and creative mistor .
Or maybe not .
Maybe we can 't sing 500 years of rational thinking in a 18 minutes .
And there 's probably people in the audience that would be reading scientific sospects on the news news , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , people spend up the next thing .
I 'm probably not going to convince you all about this .
But the question I would like to ask is -- why do no ?
Why don 't you think that way ?
Because it 's more sense of everything that has ever heard of the expering impredicbility of the creative process .
One process that , as anyone who ever tried to do something -- so , it 's basically all here -- you know , you know , you know , you don 't get rationally .
And , in fact , it can sometimes be completely paranormal .
I did this meeting recently meeting , Ruth Stone , who has now 90 years , but he was a poetry for all life and said that during his childhood in the rural Virginia , working out in the rural Virginia , and feel it , in if a poem was in if a poem was recently in the landscape .
He said that was like a fragorous train of the air .
And that was rotoling towards her to the landscape .
He felt that , because he was to tremendous the earth under his feet .
He knew I had one thing to do at that point and was of , his words , " to run like a math . "
And it goes back to the home and it was sent from this poem , and it would not have to have to make a piece of paper and a math and a math enough , and the mistake on the page .
Sometimes he couldn 't be enough to be fast , so he would be very fast and correceve and the rotolar and poetry the roolar , and he would continue to rotolar through the landscape , and he would continue to rotolar , and he would continue to be a poet .
And then there were those times -- this piece of the time I 'm never going to forget it -- there were almost losing , okay ?
So , he was running home and he was trying to look for the card and the poem was going through , and he was a math in the way that he was going , and then he said , that was like if you can go up with the other hand and the steffing .
He clearing the poem from the tail and remain in his body and transcute on the page .
And in these cases , the poem would be presented on the perfect page and intact , but the last word to the first one .
So when I heard of the thought -- it 's crazy , it 's exactly equal to my creative process .
Not all my creative process -- I 'm not a convict !
I 'm a mule , and my way to work is ; to wake up in the same orary every day and play and to work and go on on the goffly .
But even I , in my testing , I 've been striped against that thing , sometimes .
And I think that many of you have the han made .
You know , even if the work and ideas came to me from a certain source , you can 't honestly know .
And what is this ?
And how can we relate it to us to do it , but rather , what do we do is , but rather , what do we remain healthy ?
And as I 'm about , the best contemporary example I have is the musician I have is the musician , which I interviews different years ago for a newspaper .
We were talking about this , and you know , Tom , for the majority of life is incarnation of the incarnation of the contemporary , to try to control , manage , to dominate these species of impulses .
But then he invent , he calculated , and one day he was driving on a street in Los Angeles , it changed all over .
He was going to be fast and all of a tract thing this little framment of melody , which is in his head as the inspiration , elusive and the wants , and the desider , but you know , it 's wonderful , and the desider , but it doesn 't know how to take it .
It has no card piece , he has no load , he has no register .
So , I started to hear this species of old old anxioned in him , " I 'm going to lose , and I 'm going to hit , and I 'm going to hold .
I 'm not good enough and I can 't do it . "
And instead of going to the panic , and I 'm going to stop .
He 'll be able to the whole process and made something completely new .
He just just just the sky and said , " Scause , I 'm not driving ? "
" You know , it seems to write a song now ? "
If you really want to exists , you get a more opporter at a moment when I can take care of you .
Today , you go to importunre someone else today .
You 're going to disturbing Leonard Cohen . "
And his work process changed after this .
Not the work , the work was still dark as a time .
But the process , and the fish anxy that was remaining it was released when the genius , the genius that he was going to go back back to where it was , realized that it was going back to where it was , I realized that it didn 't have to be a thing and horn .
but it 's a lot of the blind , wonderful bizarre collaboration between Tom and this strange and the outside of Tom and this strange and outside that was not Tom .
So , how I felt that story to change a little bit even the way I was working and already saved me .
This idea , saved me when I was writing " Mangia , Prega , Ama , and it 's a cadd of those cads of the disperation where we 're all working on something and we can 't start thinking about something and we can 't start thinking that a disaster .
Not just bad , right , right ?
And I started thinking about to thin this project .
But then I remind to me of Tom who talked to the air and I tried .
So I went up my face on the dress and re-handed my face to a vacuum of the room .
And I said , " His , " Looking , what , we know that if this book is not going to be brilliant , don 't it ?
Because I 'm putting it all I have , I don 't have this .
So if you want to be better , you have to present you and do your part .
OK . But if you don 't do it , you know what , I don 't do anything .
I 'm going to writing the same because it 's my work .
And I want to do for me that today was recorded to me to do my part , " Because -- finally it 's so , OK -- I mean , it 's so , OK -- centuries , and the music that was so , OK -- in the end of the moon , dance and the sacres and sacres until the dawn .
And they were always magnify , because the ballerini were very wonderful .
But every so , rarely , rarely , something happened , and one of these artists became in reality .
And I know you know what I 'm talking about , because I know you all of you saw it , at a performance .
It was like the time , and the dance walk through a kind of a ballerine , and it wasn 't doing anything different from usually , like 1,000 notes before , but all it was trained .
And suddenly , it doesn 't look like a human .
But he 's on the divinity in the fire in the fire of divinity .
And when this happened , when he was , people knew what was , they called him .
They would give their hands and began to cantar , " Allah , Allah , Allah , God , " God , "
That 's God , you know .
Curious note -- when the Mori invases the Spain , I was this habitude with them and the pronounced changed in the centuries of " Allah , Allah , " to " Ole , " the " Ole , " The " Ole , " , " which you can still hear in the corries or in the flamp .
In Spain , when a artist made something impossible and magical , " Allah , " Allah , " Allah , " I would be good , " incomprerehensive , it 's a last of God .
And it 's great because we need .
But , the problem comes the day after , for the dance dance , when you wake up and discover that are 11 in the morning of Martedesh and the last last last of God .
It 's just a mortal mortal with the knees , and maybe it will never get to that altitude .
And maybe nobody will you have the name of God 's still going to be on the rest of his life ?
It 's hard .
This is one of the most paorous recognizable to make in a creative life .
But perhaps it doesn 't have to be so angoscious if you can 't believe , in the mostly extraordinary things in your being from yourselves .
But you would just believe that they 're prested data from a inimaginable source of this team , and you would have to go to someone else when you finished .
And , you know , if we think that 's all changing .
And so I started thinking about , and it 's quite sure how I thought I think about several months during the work of the book that I 'm going to try and think about , the dangerous , it 's dangerous , I 've been followed my my great success .
And what I have to continue to say when I feel electric . It 's not afraid .
Not just sharts . It 's just your work .
It 's going to be a presented to your part , any can be .
If your work is dance , it 's dance .
If the divine , it 's assurd to you assigned decide to leave some of wonderful , for one moment through your effort , then , " Ole ! "
Today , you do the same dance .
And " Ole ! " You know .
I think , and I think I should teach it .
" Ole ! " to yourself , even for human love and testing cities and testy-to-board . "
Thank you .
Thank you .
June Cohen : Ole !
As you know , I 've talked about some of these projects on the human genome , what can significance and discovery new new set of genes .
Now we 're starting a new path . We started to digitalize biology and now now starting from that digital code are going to into a new phase of biology , designing and synthetizing life .
We always tried to ask for a big questions .
" What is life ? " It 's something that many biologists I think have tried to understand levels .
We tried different approaches , reduced it to the minims .
We 're digitizens for almost 20 years .
When we sequenced the human genome was to go from analogical world of biology in the digital world .
Now we ask us : can regenerate life , or create new life from this digital universe ?
This is the map of a small organism , Mycoplasma genitalium , which is the species from the smallest genome between those that can authorean .
And we tried to reduce the genome to create a smaller .
We can eliminate a hundred genes of genes of about 500 .
But when we look at a look at the metabolic map , it 's relatively simple than our .
I think , this is simple .
But when we look at all the genes that we can eliminate , one at the time , it 's very unlikely that this can bring a living cell .
So we decided that the only way to progree to synthesize this chromosome , so that we could modify the components to bring some of these fundamental questions .
And so we started the adventure of the " Can we " to be called " " " Cromosome ? "
Can the chemistry to provide these big molecules that we never have been able to create these big molecules .
And , in case , we can we make a crumosome ?
A chromosome is just a piece of inert material inert .
The speed that we 're going to be able to digitalize life is growing up to exponential .
Our power to write the genetic code , instead , progree rather slowly , but it 's improving .
And our most recent results to a curve curve .
We started more than 15 years ago .
The process required many steps , starting with a bioethical required before we started the first experiments .
But we found that synthesize DNA is very difficult .
There are tens of thousands of machines in the world that make little segments of DNA , long , over 30 to 50 letters , and it 's a degenerative process : the segment is longer , the segment is , more than the segment is , more than the segment is , more than the segments .
So we had to develop a new method to assemble these fragments and correct the mistakes .
And this was our first attempt , to start to digital information of the genome of the Phi genome 174 .
It 's a little virus that kills .
We designed the fragments , effective the correction of the mistakes and get a DNA molecule molecule .
The interesting part is when we took this piece of inert chemical material inert and we put it in the bacteria , the bacteria have started to read this genetic code and produring the viral particles .
The viral particles have been released by the cells , they went back and they destroyed the Ecles .
I 've talked about recent with the oil industry and said that they certainly compress this model .
They 've recognizes more than you .
We think that 's a situation where the software can really build the same hardware in a biological system .
But we wanted to do things larger in big .
We wanted to build the entire crumosome of the bacteria .
It 's over 580 miles of genetic code .
So we thought we could build it in the cassette of the size viruses , so that we can change the cassets to understand what are the components of a living cells .
The design is crucial , and if we start with digital information in a computer , these are to be very accurate .
When we sequenced this genome for the first time in 1995 accuracy accuracy was a mistake for every 10 miles .
We found , we resequenced , 30 mistakes . If we had that original sequence we never would be able to do it work .
One part of the process is designing 50 letters that are moves out long , and they 're all the other segments of 50 letters to build subunits to build subunits of smaller subunits working together .
We try to unique elements here .
You probably read that we 're probably read that we 're going to be bed that we 're probably read .
And so , think , we have a genetic code based on four letters : A , C , Gs and T.
Three of those letters put together with about 20 adminoacids , and there 's a specific order to letters for every frightening .
So we can use the genetic code to write words , frases , thinking .
What we did at the beginning is to autographed .
Some have been delusers that were not poem .
We designed these segments to just unit with enzyme .
There are enzyme that are repair them and put them .
And we started to assemble of the parts , starting with five segments to seven mile , unendangers , unended up segments in a way to form 72 mile .
And we 've produced these segments in abundance , so we can sequencing them , so we 're trying to create a very robystobey-stopile processing -- as you can see in a minute .
We 're trying to automatize the process .
So , this seems to be the tabellon of a basket doet .
When we get to these very long , very long , over 100 miles , they will not grow more directly in the E.
It 's the modern instruments of modern molecular biology .
So we consider other mechanisms .
We knew about another mechanism called recombination omologa , which is useful , in biology is to repair the DNA to unite segments .
Here 's an example .
This organism , called Deinococcus radioococcus , can absorbed three million radiation .
You can see in the upper square like his cromosome as his crumosome .
In 12 -- 24 hours , it 's reassemble as it was before .
They have thousands of organisms that are able to do it .
These organisms can sit completely .
They can live under empty .
They are absolutely sure that life exists in space , and you feel to find new rich water .
ASA showed the NASA showed that this is .
This is a picture of the molecule that we 've built using these processes , just using the lievision design of the segment of the molecule segments .
The leaving lifetime is the authomatically .
This image was not taken with a microscope electric microscope , but with a microscope .
It 's a big molecule that we can see the one of the law .
These are pictures that made a period of about six seconds .
This is the advertising that we 've done a little time ago .
It 's over 580,000 letters of genetic code .
It 's the largest molecule of a defined structure .
It has a 300 million molecular fish .
If you stamp it with a cartoer 10 without spaces , it would be 142 pages to transcut this genetic code .
Now , how do we do it work ? How can we activate it ?
Obviously , we call a virus is a game from kids .
It 's a little more complicated when you use bacteria .
It 's simpler cells as well , it 's about eucariote like our : you can just extract nucleus and put one one , which is basically the process of cloning .
In the archaea bacteria , the cell cell , but we have recently demonstrated that we are able to do a complete transclt of a cell chromosome , and to another cell and to another and to activate it .
We clear a crumosome , which is a microbial cycle .
The two are different as men from the mouse .
We 've added some gene more to the way to decide what to this chromosome .
And then , I 'm sleeping enzyme , and he skies .
And when we put it in the cell was stupendomested -- and you will open our sophisticatoomic graphisticatome -- the new chromosome is going into the cell .
And we started thinking that we couldn 't go beyond , but we tried to get more into there .
This is one of the major mechanisms of evolution .
We found that many , a second , or a chromosome , or a third cromosome , adding in a second thousand of new traits to that species .
So who think about evolution as a one gene that has not understand a lot of the biology .
They have been a re-called " restressed restressing for the DNA .
The chromosome that was in the cell not one .
The cell phone -- the cell phone core that we put it .
He expressed the other cell , and he recognized the other as exrange material , and it 's been brought , and we 've been ruined with only the cell and the new chromosoma .
It became blue because of the genes we 've put .
And in a short time , all the feature of a little bit of a species , went perse , and it turned around a new species , based on the new software that we 've put in the cell .
All the proteins have changed , the members have changed , and when we read the genetic code is exactly what we 've transferred to the genetic code , exactly what we 've transferred .
Now , this may seem to look at genetic , but altering the software , we can change the things very substantial manipulation .
Now , I 've already explained that it 's not about genesis -- but to progress from three million years and a half million years of evolution , and I said that maybe we 're probably going to create a new version of the Cambrian explosion where we will create new species on this digital process .
Why do that ?
I think it 's quite obvious when we think about our necessity .
We 're going to be six billion and a half billion people in the next 40 years .
Just to give an example : I 'm born in 1946 .
Now , there are three people on the planet for each existing in 1946 .
We 're having problems now to find food , fresh water and clean , medical water and gas for six billion and a half billion people .
It will be even more than to do it for nine bill.
We use more than five billion carbon dioal billions of fuon carbon .
That means a hundred million baries a day .
When we try to find biological processes , or any kind of process to replace them , it will be a huge challenge .
We have to keep the whole hemisphere , the whole hemixing of the whole hemisphere .
At day , because of the scientific discoveries all over the world , we have a database about 20 million genes , and I like to think they are the designed components for the future .
The electric industry , you just have a dozen about components , and think about how many different things are coming out .
Our limitations are principles of biological reality and our imagination .
We now have some techniques , because of these rapidly methods , to create what we call the combinatory genomics .
We can build a big robot that can produce a million crumosomes per day .
Think about these 20 million of genes , or to try to get the processing or to make the processes or drugs , new vaccines , and we can change , and we can change , because of a small team , and create more biology now that in the last 20 years of science .
And it 's just a standard selection .
We can choose for survival , chemical production or fuel , or fuel production , or fuel production .
This is a instantaneous instantaneous software programming that we 're working on to be able to sit and design species to computer .
Well , we don 't necessarily necessarily , we don 't necessarily know how it will be .
We know exactly how to their genetic code .
We 're now focused on the fourth generation .
You saw you also see you who extract ethanol was a final finished finished .
We have carbon depending on the second , and third generation that will be soon on on the higher value , like the eight-sorts of cold , or different kinds of butanol .
But the only way that biology can have a big impact without increasing much more than the cost of food and limitarges the cost of food and limitargument would transformate the CO2 in matter before , so we 're working to design cells that can reach this purpose to the purpose , and we think we have the first carbon of quarter in about 18 months .
The solar light with CO2 is a metodo-- but in our discovery different , in our discoveries , we 've found different metods .
This is a organisms that we described in 1996 .
He lives in the deep ocean , about 2,500 feet of deep in the deep ocean temperature .
They create meter from CO2 using hydrogen molecular hydrogen .
We 're trying to figure out if we can incanalar CO2 , that can easily be translated by tubes , converting that CO2 in carbon , to drive this process .
So , short-thinkable , we can be able to increase what 's life is " that we can be able to increase what is a life is Noi , greatest -- we have the goal of replacing oil industry .
Exactly . If you can 't do that from TED , where can you ?
It would be a main source of energy .
And , we 're working on the same metods to create instantaneous vaccine .
You saw this year with influence , we 're always back to a year and with a dollar in less when it 's about to find the right vaccine .
I think what you can change fight vaccines in ancient vaccines in ancient advaccines .
So , this is how the future could start to look at , now , the tree of evolution , accelerating evolution with synthetic bacteria , I would be , and finally , arching , and infinally cell euckily .
We are so on the improving people .
Our purpose is to do a long way to live long enough to try to do it . Thank you very much .
First of all , I 'm going to show you , the fastest possible , some fundamental technology that we brought to Microsoft , in the following one . It 's a year ago . This is Seadragon .
It 's a environment that you can interact is in the local level that is to the local level of data visual data .
We 're seeing a lot of gigabyte digital photograph with a kind of zoom and continuous , for a sandwich , for a sandwich , and we are , and we avoid the images as we want .
And it doesn 't matter how big it is the amount of information that we see , how big these things are the data or the images .
Most are common photographs , but this is a scanning scanning , but this is a scanning scanning from the Congress of the Congress , and reenter in the cruxel .
It doesn 't make any difference because the only thing that prestations of a system like this is the number of pixel on your screen in any time . It 's also a very flexible architecture .
This is a book , for example , not data of images .
This is the Casa desolate of Dickens . Every colonn-tail .
To show you that 's just about it , and not images , we can do something like that , to actually see that it 's a real real representation of the text , not a picture .
It may be a little artificial way to read a electric book .
Not a recommens .
This is a more realistic example . It 's a number of The Guardian .
Every image is the beginning of a section .
And it really gives you the pleasure and the beautiful experience of reading the real cartaceea , or a day of a day , which is a multi-to-and-a-half of a .
We also did something with the corner of this number in particular of The Guardian .
We 've created a higher resolutionequality -- much higher than you use in a normal advertising -- and we 've put an extra content .
If you want to see the characteristics of this automobile , you can see here .
Or other models , or even the specific techniques .
And this really shows some of these ideas to eliminating the limits of space on the screen .
We hope that that means to put a pop-up , and other things like , and on other things , like , I don 't have to be necessary .
Of course , the map is one of the most obvious applications for this kind of technology .
And I don 't want to lose time , if we don 't say we have contribute to give them in this field .
These are all the streets in the U.S. and the U.S. geospace on over a NASA geospace .
So , we 're going to go to something else .
This is now actually coming from the web ; you can go to see .
It 's a project called Photosynthy , which combine two different technologies .
One is Seadragon and the other is a very interesting computer visual research that was made by Noah Snavely , a student of the University of Washington , with Steve Seitz Rick Seadragon . It 's a Rick Szeliski . An n n a very interesting computer computer .
And it 's from the web , managon from Seadragon .
You can see that when we do this type of screen , where we can go from one image to another and have this kind of experience , and have this kind of experience .
But the space color location of the images here has actually meaning .
The layers of visualization has been recorded these images together , so that they have been on the real places that are to restable . And then , you can see the bull of a destroy show , and these things are all linked . Here we can see the elements of a de-man-show or of a de-show , or of a de-show , and these things have been lined to the space level .
I don 't know if I have time to show you some other environment .
There are a few more space .
I want to go directly to one of the original data of Noah-- and this comes from a previous prototype of Photosynthtosynthesus , which is actually the first time last summer , is to show you what I think is really the key to be the key to this technology , Photosynthrows this technology , Photosynthrows . And it 's not necessarily evident that we put in the website .
We had to worry about legal things and so forth .
This is a re-building of Notre Dame images from Flickr . Basta digitor . Basta digitor . Basta 's Notre Dame and you get images of the kind of the areas and so forth . Egnone of these orange areas is discovered to this model .
So , they 're all images from Flickr and they 've been all connected to this .
And it 's possible to be able to be very very simple way .
You know , I never thought I would end up to work for Microsoft .
It 's very gratificent to get this kind of acaacovery here .
I think you can see that it 's a lot of different kinds of fotooth-cameras : those cell cell phones to those professional SLR , a meaning number of meaning , put together in this environment .
And if I can , I try to look at those strange .
Many of them are shorted by faces , etc .
Some of a few part here is a series of photographs -- here .
This is a poster of Notre Dame recorded correctly .
We can go from the poster to the physics of this environment .
The essential point is that we can do things with social environment . This is now taking data from the whole memory of the internal memory of how to appear the Earth , from visual point of view -- and connects to all those data together together .
All those pictures become connected together , more than the sum of the sum .
You have a model of the entire land that is emerging .
Think about this as a prolungation of Stephen Lawler on Earth .
It 's something that grows in complexity as well as people use , and the advantages to those use , and the advances to be increasing .
Their pictures are hushed with inseries of other people .
If to someone comes the idea of contrast all these things , say , " My cattext photograph of Notre Dame suddenly , I can use how to imgerate all of those data , and I can use as a point of a space immerged and the pattern for immerges in that metapuniverse , using the shopping of them , and the toward social of the red , and the cross-user experience .
Of course , a consequence of all this is extremely virtual models of every interesting part of the Earth , and that 's all the interesting part of the earth , collective images and similar images and similar images and similar images , but from the collective memory .
Thank you .
Chris Anderson : I can understand ? What your software is that your software will cont us to do is , at a certain point , in the next few years , all the photographs shared by anyone in the entire world will be practically linked together ?
BAA : Yeah . What 's doing is basically to find out .
It 's creating hyperlinks , if you want , you want , between images .
And it 's doing it in the basis of the images .
And the thing becomes very interesting if you think about the rich information semantical information that many of these images .
As when you do a picture of the web , you get a rase and the text on the page is a lot of information about the picture .
Now , what happens if you 're connecting to all your pictures ?
So the amount of interconnection and the amount of wealth that is really huge . It 's a classic effect of the network . It 's a classic effect of the network .
CA : Blaise , it 's really incredible . It 's very unbelievable .
BAA : Thank you very much .
One of the most pleasure , when you travel and one of the delicious ethnographics is to live in those who are not forgotten , the past tradiers , you have the past in the wind , you touch it in the wind , you get the past and plant .
Baster thinking that the chiamani Jaguar GDo , or that the monititor , which is the elders of meanthropology , or that in Himalaya , the buddists still sloping the respire of Dharma , to remind the central importance of the anthropology , and that the idea that the world in which we live in unsweat . It 's just a model of reality , but it 's actually a model of reality ,
the consequence of a particular adaptative choices that our established , well , many generations ago .
And , of course , we all share of the essential tracts .
We all go . We all try .
We are subjects in the initiation .
We have to deal the inexorability of death , so we don 't surprising if we can 't surprise if we can 't smile --
We all have an art .
What hits is the particular rhythm of the song , the rhythm of every culture .
It doesn 't matter that the same thing of the Borneo , or the following Vodoo 's the Curander 's Golden , or the Kenya Saharsuin Kenya sectenth in Kenya , or a cameras in the heart of the Sahara .
He was my journey of journey in the desert a month ago , or a yak alevil in the valule of Qomold-on values , the de-mother de-mother 's 's world .
All of these populations teaching us that are other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , other ways of moving in the world .
And , if you think , you think , it 's a concept that it can give you hope .
And together , silly , the myriades of the world create a cultures of the world and is important to the planet and is important for the planet and it 's important for the planet and it is important for the planet as a biosphere .
And you can think about this cultural rague as a ethnosphere and you can call the etnosphere , and you can call the thnosphere , dreams , mititites , intuitions , intuitions , intuitions , are bringing to be from the human imagination from the alba of the conscious thing .
The etnosphere is the fantastic patriage of humanity .
It 's the symbols of what we are and what we can be in how inququisitive species .
And because it was very much more of the biosphere was very consumption has been very , very quickly , and it 's very rapidly .
Nobody who is a biological , for example , 50 percent of all the species is on the orders just because it 's fake , or -- in the most apocaly-hoittics -- in the world of biological diversity -- and you don 't even even even close to hypothesis -- that of cultural diversity .
And the index of that is , of course , the language loss .
When you were born 6,000 languages on this planet .
One language is not just a vocabulous , or a bunch of a series of rules .
One language is the short of the human spirit .
It 's the half of the animal culture is in the material world .
Every language is a forest , a strong mind , a backin , a thought , a re-spiritual possibilities .
And of those 6,000 languages , as we are here in Monterey , at least half the one is not suit to be surrated in the children .
They 're not teaching to children , the people who are not teaching something , unless than something , which is already dead .
What is there more sad than being sad from silence , of being the last speech of the last to talk a language , the way , the sandwisdom of you , or anticipate the promises ?
This is a little bit of a state of someone in the world every two weeks . every two weeks , a old one weeks , a old mounly muor and he branches in the tomble of a language .
And I know somebody who 's going to say , " Do it 's not much better ?
The world would be not a better place if we talk about all the same language ? " Benissime , then we talk all talk about yoruba . Let 's talk about the dotonese .
We talk about kogi .
You will be a tractable thing about what it means that we can 't talk about your language .
And I 'd like to give you a journey through the thnosphere --
a little journey in the etnosphere to give you a hire of what we are losing .
Many of us forget that when I say , " different ways of exists , " I mean , very different ways of exists .
We take for example this Barasana Barasana , in the settle-settle , the population of the anaconda , which creates the myth of provent from latte of slats in the sacres of sacres .
It 's a popular people who can 't distinguish the blue color from the green because you were identified in the forest , which is the popular .
They have a strange language and a matrimonial rule , details " examia " " " " " " " " " " " " You have to marry a different language .
And all that has been in the past mythological past , supply , though the particularly families in these sumentions that are in these expensive familiar with marriage .
They 're going to listen to and then start talking .
We take one of the most interesting tribes I lived , the Waorani of Ecuador nural , an incredible popular people who have the first contacts in 1958 .
In 1957 , five missionaries have been trying to make a fatal mistake .
They did the photographs that they would have taken them into a picture that they would think they would have been re-size , forest that this population provide that this population had never seen anything bi-size .
They 've been raised the photos , they 've been shown them , and they 're not finding anything , they would have conclude that it was the hell , and they killed the five missionaries with the two missioners with lance .
But the Waorans don 't kill the strange .
They killed with them .
54 percent of the mortality was caused by themselves .
We are eight generations and we found two natural death and we found two natural death and when we insisted to know , they had a lot of them , and then they killed it . And then they killed it killed , and then killed it . And then they killed it . They had an incredible knowledge of the forest .
The hunters were able to recognize the animal urine .
In the early 1980s , I 've been assigned a very interesting task when my Harvard professor asked if I wanted to go to Haiti to to enjoy in the society 's basic the power of Duvalier and Tonton Macoutes and Tonton Macoutes and all the Tonton Macoutes and miles of the veiled .
For a sense of a miraculous sense of the Vodoun culture , and the Vodoo is not magic .
It 's pretty complex vision of metaphysics of the world .
Very interesting .
If I ask you to tell me the big religions of the world , what would say ?
Cristianism , Islam , Buddddisaster , Ebraism , etc .
A continent is always left out , thinking about sub-Saharan Africa doesn 't have any religious feds . And instead , yes and Vodoo is not the other than the distilside of these religious concepts in the tragic tragic ,
What makes the interesting voodoo is the intended internal voodoo is the intense relationship between life and death .
So , you can see the spirits .
The spirits can be invoced by the Great Acqua , they resonate the rhythm of the dance , and they replace the temporary to the soul of the way that for a short thing that is the following becoming up the becoming .
So , for this voodoooers love to say " You white go to church .
We say in the temple and we become God . "
And from the moment you 're having , is the spirit that you drive , how can you do it in ?
So you would have these incredible events : follow voodoo in the traance state of trance that touches impuntizing , which is a rather strongly strong the power of the mind when it 's catalyzed in a state of extreme , and you 're in a state of extreme exciting .
And all the popular people I lived the most extraordinary of the Sierra Nevada Santa Marta , in the Santa Marta , in the Santa Marta , in the Santa Marta Marta .
Did cil of the tyranges of the tyranges of the Colombia in the account of the Colombia , the popular massive playing on the vulchanical plants .
In a continent macked blood continent , this popular is never been conquisted by the Spanish .
And now , they are government in a clero , but their formation is very extraordinary .
The young people have been taken out of the families to three or four years , and live in a world that 's made of buy and homers in a world that 's made of buy and homre in the cape of the glacier for 18 years .
Two doubles of nine years choices to reproduce the nine months of management that spring in the mother , now are metaphor useres .
For all this time , they 're acculturated to the values of their society , values that predict their prayer and only their prayer , and just their prayer , or to say the balance balance balance .
At the term of this incredible initiation , they 're suddenly landed out and for the first time in their own , at 18 years , and in that consciousness of the first bloose , when the sunnice value , when the sunny value of the beautiful landscape , all of what they 've learned in theory is confirm in theory .
" Who is ? I 'm going to say .
It 's amazing . Now it 's about you can protect it . "
They call greater brothers and say that we , the minor brothers , we are the destruction of the world .
This level of intuition is extremely important .
When we think about the Ingene populations and the environment invoice Rousseau and the old story of the noble wild , which is a razer concept in his simplicity , and we say these popular people are closer to Earth .
Ingenes are not not feeling or feeling .
There is no space for these things in malaric paludi , or in the gelids of Tibet , but thank you very much of the Earth 's 's unlike the Earth 's 's unlike not about concept of the Earth 's un-un-un-untuition , but on a very much more sot-to-, but on a very sotop-to-human consciousness .
What does that mean ?
It means that a little bit of the Ande who is a little kid that the mountain is a spirit of Apu who will leave his destiny , is going to be a destroy different , and it will have a very different relationship with the mountain that is a little bit of the Montana who grow the mountain is that a mountain of rocks to be taken .
It 's a demour of a spirit or a mineral cuting is irrelevant .
What 's interesting is the metaphor that 's interesting is the report between the individual and the natural world .
I grew up in the forests of the Columbia , credying that provivivivision to be cut .
And that made me a human being different from my friends Kwakiuter who believe that the forests are the forests of Huk and the bis the historic bear of the paradise and the bear behind the world , we 're going to live northern the world , behind that affect during the Hamatsa .
If you start to consider that these cultures can create reality , you can start to understand some of them , and then we take this plant .
I 've taken this picture of aprile in the nordoccccies .
Mayahuash , some of you 've heard about the ayahuash , the most powerful psychoactive substance .
What makes it fascinating the ayahuash is not the CCCCCCCCCCCColizy 's potential of the supply . It 's composed of two elements .
On one side , this lian liana law that a series of carbfuel , harmor and harmful , and harmolines , slightly hanging .
Taking the only plants , you have a blueer smoke that is a little bit of consciousness , but it 's measured with the leaves of a family family household Psychotridis .
This plant is a lot of powerful tripptamine , very similar to serotonin , dimethox-five , methoxydimethoxtamine .
If you ever see the Yanomami , pull me out of the nose that they do from a different species , he 's a different set of species , he 's a different methoxtamine .
To see that poor is a little bit like being disappeared by a carric file , and land-eyes on a sun-eyes of electricity . It 's not a distorsion of reality . It 's actually creates the dissolution of reality .
I was often with my professor , Richard Evan Shultes , the man who has been sent the psycheadelic , with his discovery of the fungi of the fungi of the fungi of the fungi in the 1930s .
I think my second tesis , you can 't classifly these triptamine as well , because if you 're not going to tell nobody to be hallucinated . And then , I can 't be done much much because they can 't be emphasit by a zyme that 's natural zyme that 's a zyme that 's natural major monoxase-stasy .
It 's possible to be at the horally only if you can advance with other chemicals .
Now , the beautiful carbs , the beauty : Ps who are in this lian is inhibition of MAO , the same type of potential to potential triptamine . The spontaneous question : in a flour popular , how do these popular finds , how these people have been found out of two dees chemical deep , but if you combinate in this way , create a biochemical sum version of the sum version of the sum .
We use the great eupheror eupheror , which can be infruit .
But if we ask the Indians will tell us , " Pleant . "
What does that mean ?
This tribes , the Cofan , has 17 variety of ayahuash , which are narrow in the forest , and that our eyes would be remain in in the forest , and that our eyes would be remain in .
If you ask them how they will they will say , " I said , " I thought , I 'd understand us , " I thought I could understand how much of the rest , you don 't know all ? "
The solution is : you take the 17 variety in a night , and each one will sunnice and each one will cannot .
And in this is not graduate in Harvard , but it 's much more interesting than to count the stams .
Now , [ applausi ] the problem is that even the one of us who have to heart people find them paintings , but somehow reducts , in some way reducts to the margins of the real world , and pass beyond .
In fact , the 19th century , in 300 years , it will not remind for its or technologic innovations , but rather like the thing that was in which we are stopped and have been actively accepted or passively accepted or passively accepted or passively accepted or the planet . Now the problem is not the change .
All cultures through the centuries have been involved in a new chance of life .
And the problem is not technology .
Indians Sioux , they don 't have stop being Sioux when they put up in the arco and make the recage , like this Americans have no stopped to be American when they put on the horse and calculus .
It 's not the change or technology that threw the integrity of the etnosphere . It 's the power . It 's the power .
The hard flight of domination .
And if you give a look at the world , you 'll find that these are not destinated cultures .
They are living and dynamics and spint out of the identificable forces that go beyonic forces .
I know , I know , you know , the pathries of Penan --
a popular nobble nobble , in the Sarawak , a popular who lived free to a generation , and now reduced to a generation , and now reduced to the servito and prostitution on the recentume , where you can see the river inquinfire , where you can see the reporting inquinquinquination , the re-to-throad .
Wote to fly reempier the stock with the forest .
Or , in the case of Yanomami , are disease that have come with the discovery of the gold .
If we move on the mountains of Tibet , where I 'm doing a lot of researchers , you 'll see the hard flight of political domination .
As you know the genocide , the physics of a popular , is a popular level , but the ride , the destruction of life , but the destruction of the lifestyle of a population , not only is celebrated , but I 'm even going to be celebrated in certain environments , because it makes part of the development .
And you can 't understand the suffering of Tibet until you 're in the beginning .
I 've been around 6,000 miles from Chengdu in the Western China through Tibet soriental , coming in Lhasa with a young colleague , but only reached in Lhasa , I realized what 's behind the statistics we hear .
6,000 sacres in poor or or cenry .
1.2 million people killed by the military , the Cultural Rivolution .
The father of this guy was ascritical to Panchen Lama .
That means that it was killed in the Chinese invasion .
Her , the uncle is sitting with Santity in Santity , in Santity , in Nepal .
His mother was imprigioned and his cold was to be rich .
It was brought to hidden in the age of two years , hidden under his gonna because he couldn 't live live without him .
The sister , which did the same , was put in reducing reducation .
One day , he inavailable to calculate a raffigant Mao and , for this transgression , it was put on the several seven-year-old .
The Tibet of Tibet can be uninbet , but the spirit of the popular is to the present .
And then , all you reduce a choice .
We want to live in the world world of the monoonia or we want to accover the world policy ?
The big anthropologue , Margaret Mead , before he said that his biggest fear was that , in our way to go to this view of the world , not only we will see the whole range of the world , not only one day we will take a sleep limited mode from a sleep concern by a sleep , and we will get to a sleep , and we will be forget .
And it 's umilliar remind that we have been in 600,000 years .
The Neolitical Rivolution , which has given us the agriculture , which has done us to subject the seed of the champ of the smong , and we talk about 10,000 years ago .
The modern world industrialized is 300 years .
That evening squality history , I don 't suggests that we have the answers to all the challenges that we 're going to have to deal in the millennia to come .
When they were to these cultures of the world is asked what it means to be human , they resonate with 10,000 different voices .
And it 's in these answers that we all have the possibility of being what we are : a kind of a conscious , that has to make all the popular , and all the gardens can be . And there 's big moments of optimism .
I 've been taken this picture on the northern summariland , when I went to the whales of the Inuit , and this man , Olaya , and this man , Olaya , Olaya , and this man , Olaya , and he told me a wonderful story of his grandfather .
The Sanadian government has not always been gentle with the Inuit and in the 1950s to stbilish our supremize , we have them in colonies .
The grandfather of this man refused to go .
The family , I temonking him all the time , and all of his himself , and all of his hits .
You have to know that Inuit doesn 't teat the cold , they use it .
The pattins of sleds in origin were made of sleep .
The grandfather of this man didn 't have to be a tartical or from the library , and he had to be .
It 's sgattle , it 's calculated the pantalone in the foca skin and defecated in your hand . When I did did you did it , you work creating a moama .
He spruzed salive on the dog of this hell , and when he became solid , he killed a dog .
He has taken a sleep , and he made a brilliant , with the cass created a slether , and he imbrid on the bling bling bank , and it 's disappeared on the bling bank , and it 's disappeared on the bank .
We want to talk about cavarself-event . And this , in different ways , [ Applausi . ] And this is the symble of resilience of the Inuit 's popular Inuit and all of the indigenous popular people in the world .
In april aprile 1999 , the canadied government reddated to the total control of an area of the California and Texas I put together .
It 's the new paa . It 's called Nunavut .
It 's an independent territory . They all the resources .
One of the splendid example of a natione-state can recognize with his popular .
And , finally , I think it 's pretty obvious at least in those remote song of us in these remote song of the planet , to realize that they 're not remote .
For someone is home .
They representing several human imagation that sell up to the temple . And for all of us , the dreams of these children , like the dreams of our children , become part of the geography of hope .
From , we of National Geographic , we convinced that politicians will never come to anything .
We think the polemids --
[ Applausi is not persuasive , but we believe that the stories can change the world , and maybe we 're the best institution to tell stories of the world . Every month re-recognition to tell stories of the world . Every month red-35 million visit visit .
156 countries transmit our television channel .
Our reviviously letters are lled lectures from millions of people .
Our work is to travel the etnosphere to bring our audience in a wonderful cultural places that are going to be baged by how they saw and , you hope , abbracing , and they will be able to , and we have to find a life in the diversity , and we have to find a life in a plurality world and we have to find a life in a plurality of life in a plurality and multicultural world 's life in a pluralone .
where all the popular wisdom of all the popular wisdom .
Thank you .
I 'm going to talk about some things that I wrote in this book that I hope I 'll be called and try to evidence some connections , in case , you wouldn 't notice them .
I want to start with what I call the " the official dogma "
The dogma official dogma thing ?
The dogma official dogma of all the Western society . The official dogma official dogma " " If we want to massix-being of our citizens . "
The reason is , from one side , in the fact that freedom is in itself a value , is workable , is useful , utile , essential for human beings .
Other is the fact that if we are free , each of us can act for all of us to do it for all the things that massive well-being , without no one who decides .
The way to massive freedom is massimilar to massimilar .
More choices people have , more are free , and more are free , and more is their wealth , greater is .
This , I think , is so deeply radically dyed in society that nobody would be to put it in doubt .
And it 's also dyed in our lives .
I 'm going to show you some examples of what progress has made possible .
This is my supermarket . It 's not particularly big .
I lose a very simple note of on the saving conditions .
In my supermarket , there are 175 , without content 10 variety of extraverage , and 12 , and 12 aceters , and 12 aceters , which you can buy for a huge number of conditions in the incbreaking circumstance that nobody of the 175 of your degree .
Here 's what the supermarket is .
And then you go to the electronic store to buy a stereo . CD , radio , radio , piaright , the race , the race .
And in this single core , there 's a big number of power .
We can make six million and a half million different fight , using the components that there are only one store .
We need to admit that 's a lot of choice .
The world of communications : the world of communications .
Once , when I was a child , you could get all the services telephone services , and pat the package that were fornitable by mom Bell .
He was given the phone , you didn 't buy it .
A consequence of that , the phone was not reach .
These days are gone .
We have a nearly variety of telephones , especially among the cell phone .
Here 's the cell phones of the future .
My favorite is in the middle , MP3 , cut , and hang on the nose , and the household me .
If you don 't have yet seen it in the store under house , you 're very much going to get .
And what happens is that people go into the stops and make this question . And you know what is the answer is ? The answer is " No . "
It 's not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn 't do too many things .
So , in other things of life that are much more important than the pursuit , you have the same bull of choices .
Assistence , not happens to the United States that you go to the doctor and the doctor you say what you have to do .
Instead , you go to the doctor , and the doctor says , " OK , we could do A , or B , " A has these benefits and these " B is these benefits and risks . What do you want to do ? "
You say , " You know , what should I do ? "
And the doctor says , " You have these benefits and risks , and you have these benefits and risks . "
" What do you want to do ? "
And you rebits , " Dottore if she was me , what would you do ? "
And the doctor : " But I 'm not . "
The results we call it " autonomy of malation , expression that makes it look like a beautiful thing .
But it 's not that one moving the weight and responsibility to make decisions from someone who knows something , which is the doctor , to someone else knows -- and almost certainly , and so almost certainly , it 's maled -- and so it 's not in the ideal condition to make decisions .
There 's a huge marketing products , direct drug to people like me and you , that if you think , it 's no sense , because if you think you can 't buy them .
But if we can 't buy them , because they have public icizing ?
The answer is that they want to domorning , we call the doctor to ask them to change the rich .
What of so fundamental as a fundamental identity is a question of choice , as you see in this dreams . " We don 't want to force the children . We 're going to force the right now . " We don 't know more a identity : we have to invent .
And we can reinvent how many times we can be reinvented .
That means that every morning , at the answers , you have to decide that kind of person you want to be .
I think it was a family and marriage , a time perspective , a time perspective , which was that you married the most soon possible , and it started to be able to be able , and it started to be as possible .
The only real choice was with who , not when , and even when , and even what to do after .
Ose it , it 's really to play .
I teach students very smart , and I do 20 percent of work than a time .
And it 's not because they 're unless diligent , not because they are less diligent .
but why I 'm impensieritous , I mean , I would be married or not ? I should be able to do it now ?
" Would I be married later ? " I have to think before I got to think before or career ? "
They are interrogative logorants .
And they try to answer these questions , even though this implishy , not to get the companies that assumption and not getting a beautiful vote to my examples .
And they have to do it . They 're important questions .
Now , the work : we are lucky , like Carl , because technology allows us to work every minute , every day , from every day , from every day , on every day , from every angle of the planet , except that Hotel Randolph .
I 'm talking about , there 's a corner , and I won 't tell nobody what the WiFi works .
I don 't tell you , because I want to use it .
What does this mean , this amazing freedom of choice that we have about work ? It 's that we have to continue , and we have to work or not .
We can go to see our son playing hot , with the cell phone in a cell phone , the Blackberry in the other , and the notebook , behind the kberry .
And even though I 'm all spent , every minute that we see our son 's game , we 're also asking the game , we 're also asking this call ?
" I have to answer this email ? I have to abbozzle this letter ? "
And even when the answer is " no , " all this makes the experience of your own son 's game of your son , very different than what would be in other conditions .
So , anywhere we look at , little things , big and big , materials and life , life is a question of choices .
Once the world was this : Ovice , there were some possibilities , but it wasn 't a question of choice .
The world today is a good thing , the dilemma is , " Is it a positive thing , or negative ? "
The answer is Surprimary .
The positive lates them , we know , the negative latest ones .
And all this choice two of negative effects on people .
The first one , paradoxically , is that it makes a lot of liberation .
With a lot of options between which choice , becomes very difficult to do it .
I offer an example : a conduct example : a conduct for volunteer .
A colleague has been access to the Vanguard data , the giant source society , with about one million depension , with about one million of 2000 companies .
What she found is that for every 10 solutions that are offered in more , the percentage of two percent .
With 50 offerals , there 's 10 percent in less adhesions than when they are available only five . Why ?
Because with 50 sourds between which choosing , is sick difficult to decide , and the choice is remaining tomorrow .
And to ask , and I think , and I think , and of course , and of course , of course , and of course , we 're going to ask .
You can 't only do that means that these work from the old work on the dogs because they 're not going to have enough money , it also wants to say that the decision is so hostical sourds of work .
I don 't participating , they 're losing up to five to thousand dollars for year from work , which is very well going to be disposed to be .
So , the paralysis a consequence of having too many choices .
And I think it makes the world that 's like this .
" And finally , for ethernity : ketchup , " senape or " ? "
You would take the right decision , if it 's for ethernity , is it ?
You don 't want to choose the wrong wrong , and you don 't want to choose the wrong condition .
So this is the first effect . The second is that we can avoid paralysis and do a choice , at the end , we 're fewer than we would be with less options of how we would be with less options .
And this is for different reasons .
One of these is that with many conditions , and what 's going on is that it 's not perfect , it 's easy to imagine that you would have a different choice that you could have been better . And what 's going on is better . And what 's going on is that the alternative imagined by decision , and the rest of the choice , and the repair beat the end of the rest of the rest of the rest of the decision that you would have been better at the decision ,
And when it was a very good decision .
And the more choice , there 's more easy to dislie than any detail that is unsoddatives .
And also , there is what economists call expensive expensive .
Dan Gilbert clear , very well stamacine like the value that we go to the things that we face .
Other rest , when there are so many options , it 's easy to represent the feature of the alternative shot of the option that you are to be less satis-choice .
Here 's an example . I know , I 'm a lot of recently .
But that 's what you would probably think .
There 's this copy to Hamptons .
A lussian place of lussian .
It 's splendida . Otly nearly . It 's all for them .
Not anything . But what he thinks is , " Well , males , it 's Agotten . "
" All my close to Manhattan is away . "
" I could talk about the right in front of home . "
And it 's two weeks of the idea that it 's losing -- every day -- the ability to parking -- every day -- the ability to parking where he wants .
The constantly decrease the satisfaction for what we have , even when choice is excellent .
And the most are the options that we have to think , the more , the feature will be return to us against how expensive .
Here 's another example .
This saw a lot of things .
It 's about living at the moment , and maybe living slowly .
But the most important point is that anything you choice , you 're not doing other .
The things that we don 't choose to be so many attractive active than we do .
Third point : the spiral of expectations .
I tried it on my skin buying a new jeans .
I 'm going to be jeans .
Once jeans were just like , buying and sleep , they were unaware of them , they were discomodissized , only after having a life and work , and they were a lot of times , they were all all good .
So I went to buy a couple of when those old people had gone , and I said , " I need a couple of jeans , this is my cut . "
The command said , " Do you want to me fit , and the fit ? "
You want them to be with the cerniera or the buttons ? " Stonewashed or " " " " " " " " " " " "
" Do you want to be layers ? "
" His you want to take them or stretch ? Bla bla -- " Continuating .
I was sleep , and after a little bit , I want to say , " I want to say , " I want to know , " I want to say , " I want to know all jeans , and then I 'm going to be sick , and then I 'm going to get a couple of jeans who had ever .
It was the massive . I had the whole choice . I had the best one .
But I felt worse .
Why ? I wrote a whole book for understanding him .
The reason I was worse is that with all that choice of my expectations were very high , jeans had to be perfect .
I was the beginning I had expectations . I didn 't expect anything except when there was one guy , but when I saw 100 different , accidents , at least one of them had to be perfect .
What I had buy was good , but not perfect .
After I had paragoned that choice with what I was sationally satis-facility .
The adding options in life is not doing the expectations that are respect to the excellence of the options of the same .
And this will be less satisfacing , even when you get the results .
None in the world marketing and realized it .
Because if they knew , you would not know what I 'm talking about .
The truth looks more like this .
" It was better when he was worse . " The reason that was better when it was worse was even worse is that when you were worse to the surprised .
Ose , the world in which we live -- opulent , industrialized citizens with the expectancy of the package -- the massive that we can hope is that things are on expectations .
You never have surprised pleasant because your expectations , my expectations , I 'm unexpected .
The secret of happiness -- what you 're here -- is , " Baxy expectation . "
I mean , little carographic moment -- that I really married and my wife is really wonderful .
I couldn 't do it better , I didn 't have been conented .
But it 's not always a bad thing .
And finally , a consequence of buy a couple of jeans , when there 's just that jeans is that when you have , and you ask , " Why ? "
" Who is responsible ? " The answer is clear .
The world is responsible . What can I do with it ?
When there are hundreds of kinds of jeans , and you can buy a satisfacing , and ask you who is responsible , it 's the clear , it 's the clear , it 's the likely to you .
You would have to do better .
With hundreds of variety of variety of variety , not there are no insuccess .
So when people take decisions , even though the results is alid , they 're satio , they feel like , and they 're sationally , they 're going to be sationally .
In the last few years , the depression is exploded in the last few years .
I think a meaning factor -- not the only one , but important -- of this wave of depression is that people have some of the people have experiences because standard are too high .
And when they have to explain this situation think that colder is they think they 're .
So the final results is that we are better , we 're going to be worse .
Let me remember you .
This is the official dogma , what we all get for good and it 's completely fake . It 's not true .
There 's no doubt that a little bit of choice is better than I have to do , but it 's not going to be a little bit .
There 's a critical value , magic . I don 't know what it is .
But I 'm sure I 'm sure we 've been going to be a piece of a level in which choices to improve our life .
Now , from the political point of view -- I 've almost finished -- from political point , the core is the following .
What allows this all this choice in industrial society is the material wealth .
There are many places in the world , and you know , you know , where the problem is not that they have too many places .
The problem is that they have too ,
So the focusing to the factory I 'm talking about is a malbeing exclusive of modern , rich society .
And what it does to depress and climber is this : Steve Levitt Levitt talked about how expensive and discover discover that 's unuseful . It 's a sprec sprec extrtrtractive . It 's a sprec sprec of money .
I mean that these choices , complicated and available , it 's not that they 're unuseful .
I 'm even deleteries .
They do be worse .
If you have a little bit of what in our society is reversated in those where people have too few possibilities , too few possibilities , it would not just be their life to improve but our own .
This is what economists call a paretian improving improving .
A redistribution of income redistribution to everybody -- not only to poor -- because of this choice in excess ,
For the end , " You can get it , you can become all what you want " --
You , you , you think , " What does that fish ? "
" It 's obvious that you can 't make anything in a glass . "
" A re-castrated vision of a world --
and I 'm going to be interpret so , at the beginning .
But then , I think , instead , I realized that fish knows the long .
Because the reality of the facts is that if you 're missing the boil , so that , " everything is possible " you can 't get the freedom . You get the paralysis .
If you break the box in a way that all the decrease can decrease satisfaction .
You can take the paralysis , and you 'll reduce the well-being .
Everybody needs a sphere .
This is almost certainly too close , maybe even for the fish , and it 's sure for us .
But the absence of a bunch of symbolic symbolic and , I 'm supposed to be a recipe for infelity .
Thank you very much .
