Last year I showed these slide slide that calotta cycle , which is about three million years had the size of the 48 of the United States of 48 continental continental continental continental continent , is reaching in 40 percent .
But this subvalue of the problem of the problem because it doesn 't show it spent of the ice .
The artical calottical calots , in a sense , the heart of course , the heart of the global climate system .
You go up and the winds and the summer .
The next slide will be a quickly carrelated to the last 25 years .
The ice ice ice has been signed in red .
As you see , they 're going to be the blue .
That 's the ice in the winverno , which is ritized window .
You can see that cosidgn ice , in five years or more , is like blood , which is like blood , which is like blood .
And in 25 years , it 's been on this .
This is a problem because the replication of the cycle , where the glacier around the ocean where there are enormous amount of carbon congelated , they 're transformed in metane .
I think it 's a totality of the inatmospherent , that 's a lot of global warming , that could double , super----waste , super---re-remove .
And in some of the lagreing in Alaska metane is already rebolling from water .
The professorse Katey Walter of Alaska is a team of a pressed pressed lago with a fast last lago .
Video : Wow ! Gore : I 'm well well . The question is if we 're also going to be .
This is that this termal recenter Groenland from the north .
This is a record in the glacial record .
The brought had never reached .
This is the Kangerlussuaq , in the sound of the Groenland .
If you want to know how the sea level of the sea , of the ice of the ice of the ice of the sea .
These are increasing .
On the other side of the planet : Antards , the greatest bloclock of the planet .
The month scientist scientists have dichieved that the ice of ice is in negative , and that Antarters in the Western , which pogy on some of the sun , is particularly in the waste .
Eval six feet feet of the level of the acque , like Groenland .
Sulla Himalaya , the third third block , you see new lager , which was ice ice ice .
40 percent of the world population will received half of the potable water .
Sulle Ande : this ice is the source of the water , the potail of this city .
The landed is increased .
But when it diminuminate , the same happens to the water .
In California the neighborhood is died 40 percent .
The crisks are in the crisis .
The predictions , as you know , they 're great .
The growth in the world leads to a remarkable remarkable .
The disaster is increasing and a rim out of the normal and without precedenters .
Four times more numbers in the last 30 years , I was precedented 75 .
This is a sorts of all insustainable .
If you look at the historical context if you can see the consequences .
In the last five years , we added 70 million tons of CO2 every 24 hours -- 25 million tons in the ocean every day .
Look at the area of the Pacific Pacific , and the west area , and in both of the substant parts of the subcontinent , where there 's a radical imor oxygen in the ocean .
The greater because of global warming , together to deforestation , which is 20 percent , is the 20 percent , is the use of fossil .
The oil is a problem , and the carbon is even worse .
The United States are one of the two countries with the most emissions , together to China .
And it was propond of building many other cents in carbon .
But we 're doing it in a changing changing .
These are the anullate projects in the last few years and some of the greatest , and some of the real real real .
And in the way , there 's a political load in our country .
The carbon of carbon and oil oil have spent 250 million dollars in the last year to promote carbon , which is a bunch of the pulit .
And that image I remember something --
Vert Natal , in the Tennessee , where I was a loss of 3.8 billion likers of the sorts of of carbon .
Maybe you saw about the news .
This is the biggest second flow of last last fluss in America .
It 's successed around Natal .
The published of one of the carbon industry was this .
Video : â™« Frosty coal is a kind of allegro and happy .
It 's abundying in America , and it 's growing our economy .
It 's more and the carbon is more and more .
It 's a good price , and the workers are doing it .
Al Gore : The West Virginia .
The greatest minerair on the mountains is Massey Comper . This is his friendator .
Video : Don Blakenship : I 'm going to be able to Jor , Nancy Peloothers , Harry Reid -- they don 't know what they 're talking about .
Al Gore : So the Alleance for Proteition of Clima has launched two campaign .
This is a part of them , a part .
Video : Acore COALergy we see the climate change change as a sery minacts to our business .
So , in this priority is to invest of money in a song in a song of advertitising and confused the verity of the carbon .
And actually , the carbon is not sporite .
We think it 's clean -- it 's also a good defum .
So , not prephidden of climate change .
Let me do it .
Video : Acore : Carbone pulit -- you 've heard a lot of it .
So we do a little bit of a structure in a structure of the bottom of the pulit of the pulit .
Straordinary ! The machines are a little rumorous , but this is the sound of the coal technology .
The consumed of carbon is between the main of global warming , but the remarkable technology , but the remarkable of carbon , which you see changes all .
Date a look at : this is the odiergn technology of the pulit technology .
Al Gore : Infinally , the alternative , the alternational question and the national security .
Video : The America is in the crime ; the economy , the national economy , the national economy .
The fall that connects : our dependence from the combustible , like carbon dible , like carbon sporite and oil oil oil oil .
Now , I have a new solution , audace solution to use .
Really America : 100 percent of a energy energy in 10 years .
A plan to reput America to work , and make sure us sure , and help us make sure , and help us to stop the global warming .
And so , a solution that we basts to solve our problems .
Really America .
Al Gore : This is the last .
Video : It 's about report to America .
One of the faster ways of the depends of the dependence of depends that kills our planet .
Compars : The future is here . Very , a new energy network .
Compars : Nubibibibibibibibibibibibibia .
Dement : Repower America .
Al Gore : A old proverbian African an old degree says , " If you want to go from soldiers .
If you want to go away , you go together . "
We have to go away away , quickly .
Thank you very much .
Last year at TED , I did a introduction on the LHC .
And promise to travel up to travel , and you can get up with how the machine works .
So , there was no one of the other time , there were no , the LHC is the great scientific experiment ever tuned -- 27 miles of the jump scientific experiment .
His understanding of reating the conditions that were present less than a billion times from the beginning of the universe -- to 600 million times a second .
So , all that 's just environmental .
This is the machine Ginevra .
We do this min-Big Bang in the requories .
This is what I work . This is called ATLAS -- it 's like 44 feet and it has a dyond 22 feet .
This is a picture of ATLATLAS in building so you can see proportions .
To10 sets of the last year we have acceso the machine for the first time .
And this picture was taken by ATLAS .
It was because of immense festeggiving in the room of control .
It 's a picture of the first fashion of particles that had done all the LHC , both in collision , in the LHC , and spread particles in the reflies in the reflist .
In other words , when we see that image 10 settember , we realized that the machine was a great vitten .
I don 't know if it was this to do us to do more or this , when somebody went on on Google and vide that the page was this .
That means we had a cultural impact beyond .
And a week later , there was a problem with the machine , I had to these fix here -- these fixes here -- these fidy-horate .
These are 13,000 print , when the machine works in the massive of the potence of potence .
Now , the technical of you will look at the file and say , " It 's not true . I 'm very sotle . " It 's not true . "
And they can do it because when they 're very cosiddicks .
So , at least 271 degree , to a temperature , in the inferior in the stars , these fix can bring that on the wind .
In one of the giuntures of the most novehicle in the LHC , there was a defy of fabication .
So the fix file , and the 13,000 practice , and 13,000 pricing .
This was the result .
Now , this is still more impressive if you think these magnetic magnetic magnetic fall , and that they were moving about 30 centimeters .
They are danneighborhood about 50 magneti .
We had to reach them , what we did .
We rested and travel and travel .
They 're reaching all the subject .
I mean , the end of the LHC will be again .
We 'll get it , and we expect to get the right data , and we expect to the right data , and continue so we can find what the morons that are the morons that they 're constitude the universe .
Now , of course , in a certain way , these accidents are reaching the debate of the value of science and engineering in front of the engineering and engineering in front of the engineering and engineering .
I think the fact that 's so hard , the fact of the limititation of things like LHC .
I want to conclude with words of a English scientists , Humphrey , which , I imagine , in difense , and that 's a lot of the experiments of his own , and he said , " Nist , he said , " Nist 's so dangerous for progress of human mind , which is that there are not a lot of people who are defines , and in nature , which is , in nature , which is , and in nature , and that 's worlddly ,
Thank you .
I want to start thinking about when , you 're playing up with kids , players .
And as you understand how to reach them and get them , and get them and get them , you know , and you know , you know , and you know , and we 're going to be able to think and solve .
The spacy reasoning is deeply connected to the way we understand in the world .
So , from the ispirate of our interaction with physical objects , together to my consulent Patch , and my collaborator , and my collaborator , and I started my Jeevan Kalanithi , and if we use a computer , instead of having the mouse , like pollabel , which is a computer , in a drubs , we could actually clumouse , in your hands , we could be a bands of hands , with a hands , with a sor , with the hands ,
and it would it like our please ?
The question was so interesting that we decided to exploring the answer , building the answer , and build the Siftable .
In a few words , a Siftable computer interactive as a great interactive computer as a bidden .
In a few words , a Siftable computer interactive as a great interactive computer as a bidden .
You can move with your hand , they can see " between them , " to hear their movement and they have a screen and a radio wireless .
But sostuted , they 're physical objects , like the morning , they can move into a grandy .
The Siftable are the example of a new ecosystem of tools to manipulate information information .
And as they become more physical , consciousness of the way , of the other , and and as they become more physical , and we can exploring new and different things , and we can exploring new and different interaction of interaction .
I 'm going to start with a simple example .
This Siftable is configurate to show video : if you put it in a direction , the video , the video rhydrove , the video rings , if you 're sin the other side .
These interactive reactive .
If you deal , they 're interested in what they 're doing around .
If they 're circles , they can get it and they can get a little bit .
If they 're circles , they can get it and they can get a little bit .
They also have their movement and inlination .
We have the interaction of the interaction of the interaction was able to be able to use of the data , to the example of the data , to the example of the way , to the conversation of the data .
In this case , we have three Siftable , as a bunch and I can use them to the color in that central , where you 're mixed .
and I can use it to the color in that center , where they 're mixed .
If we 're going to get a little bit of place .
I 'm also beautiful possibility of appreneurs , like language , and the mathematics and games where people can try and get the result result to the things , and you see the result of the result of the result of the result of the result of the result of the result .
Now I 'm --
This is a Fibonacy sequence of equations that I do with a equations of equations .
Here we have a game of words that 's half a half of the Scarabeo and Boble .
Pratically , at every turnal turnal , in any case , Pratically , to every Siftable , Pratically , to every Sifable , and while while you 're looking at a source .
And then , after about 30 seconds , and you have a new land-up and new possibility to try to try .
Thank you .
And here 's the kids came in in the Media Lab , I did in a way that I tried them and I was a video .
They have very liked .
And one of the interesting things like this is that we application is that not to give people many education .
You just say , " Compons of words , " and they 'll be exactly what do .
Here 's how many people who are doing it .
This is our young tester tester , there 's the most young , there 's the right .
It was actually wanted to improve them .
They 're only only morning , for him .
Now , this is a application of a interactive carton .
We wanted to build a tool for the language of language Lui Lui is Felix .
It can put new characters in the sandscene , and they solved the Siftable .
It can put new characters in the sandscene , and they solved the Siftable .
Here 's what 's doing is , you 're doing the sun .
Video : The sun is surgend .
David Merrill : Now he brought a treat the bottom .
Video : The treat the horange .
Bel work !
So eight schools and put close to interact the characters --
Video : Bau !
-- inventing your story .
Video : Hao !
DM : It 's a story with the open , and it can decide him as you svolugly .
DM : It 's a story with the open , and it can decide him as you svolugly .
Video : Very gat .
DM : The last example I have the time of showing you is a tool , I 've been able to show you and exeguing music .
It 's a tool , I made of recent , to spioning and to make music .
The Siftable here are aging to sound , and the bacteria .
Each of these have four different variations , and you can choose what to use .
You can also put these sound in a sequence from compories to your pleasure .
And it 's just doing it by doing a sound and a sequence . "
These are actually actually able that you can control from the vial , like the reverbed and the filter .
It 's a particular sound and then inclens to them .
And then there are general effects as time and fly , which is applied to the intersequence .
Let 's look like it .
Video : We 'll start a basic , we 'll put a bottom in two Siftable sequence , we can put in a series , we add on the other base .
Now I put a line of the bottom line .
Video : Now I add the percussions --
Video : And I 'm going to put the philing of bacteria , so I can control the effect from the vial .
Video : I can fast the internal interal sequence , the inlining time from a side side or another .
Video : And I 'll add the mobile philing to give more expression .
Video : I can recombine sequence the sequence of the flight .
So I don 't have to planning it before , but I can improvised , and make it reporter or more corner .
And now , I can spend the whole sequence , I can spend the Siftable to the Siftable to the Siftable . "
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is to build new interfaces like our brain and body .
And today , I had time to show you one of the result of this percourse , and also some possibility that we try to bring out of the lab .
The concept I want to get to is that 's coming up with the new generation of designed design to interact with digital media , which will leaving information in our world that we want .
Thank you very much .
I don 't see the hour of you .
I 'm a wrote .
I 'm going to be the books is my profession , but it 's more than that , of course .
It 's also love and the fashion and my life .
And I don 't expect that can change .
But , said this , something particular happened in my life and my life , and in my life and my career , which has taken me to recently the interior relationship with this work .
The particular thing is that I 've been written this book , this biography called " Mangia , Prega , " which , the diversity of my precedented books , for some reason used in the world and became a great feelational , bestler .
And the result is that everywhere to be now , people treatment like if they were constructed .
It 's true -- it 's constructed .
They 're all right now all worry and they say , " Do you have no longer to do ?
You don 't have a paar to write for all of life without able to create a book that can be able to create a book that can be able to someone ? "
that can be importance to someone ? "
It 's rassure , you know .
But it could go worse , in the part of that I remember that more than 20 years ago , when I started to say people -- I was a writing .
I was in the same reaction , the same reaction .
And people said , " Don 't you get successful ?
Do you know that the million of the refied refied ?
You don 't have a paar of doing this mestior for all of life without anything to be there and define on a cure of dreaming with the pile of pile ,
So , you know .
The answer -- the short answer to all these questions is , " Yeah . "
And I 'm paar of all those things .
I 've always had a paar .
And I also have a lot of other things that people can 't inhate .
As the algae and other things .
But , how much about it it was that I thought and I would ask me the last mentive is because ?
Is it ?
It 's logical that anybody who has been waiting to be spend by a job that you know .
But what is that particular in the impressive , and creative to make us nervous vity in a way that other people in a way that other carry on a way that other carry ?
How dad , for example , he was a chemical engineering and not remember one time in the 40 years of activity in which the 40 years of activity in which the people who were asked if they were paper to be engineering ?
There was never -- that bloclock of my engineers , like ?
It didn 't work so , you know ?
Onestly , the engineers like group have not certainly , in the seufacturing , in the searticle of being alcolilized .
We 've been a reputation , and we have this reputation , and not just writers , but creativity of any kind of instainable to be enormous instainable .
And it 's not to look at the tribe to watch for the deaths of the magnifments that , only in the ventuary century , they die and often for them .
And even the ones that you don 't have soicians seem to be really dised by their dons .
Nortman Mailer , before he said , " Our book said , " Our book , my book was actually an extraordinary of the work of their life .
But we don 't get the boy when we feel that because we 've heard these things so much that in some way we have completely interiorized and accepted the notion that creativity and suffering are in some way that the art , will always be in the way , will always fall the way , will be going to be going to to go and angry .
And the question I want to take all of today is : you 're agree with this idea ?
It 's well -- because it 's also looking at a centimeter of a distance to me not well for anything .
I think it 's odious .
And I think it 's dangerous and I don 't want to see the perpetuated in the next century .
I think it 's better to encourage our great creative minds .
And I know that , in my case -- in my case -- it would be very dangerous , I was going to start to be able to start with that I 'm going to be in the circumstanances that are in my career .
It 's really -- insum , I 'm rather young , I have about 40 years .
I still have about four decades of work in me .
And it 's very lilikely that anything I 'm going to write from the world like the work that I was going to use it in my last book .
I 'm going to be all more or less friends here -- it 's likely that my greatest successful .
Oh , Gesus , who thought !
You know this is the kind of thought that leads to start to start bate in the day in the morning and I don 't want to do it .
I would keep doing this work that we do this work that we .
So , the question became , how ?
And so it seems , after a lot of reflessions , which the way to work to continue is to create a psychologic psychologic psychologic psychologic , right ?
I have to find a distance of security of me between me , and I 'm written , and my natural anxial , which reaction is that they writing . And while I was trying to do it in the time , trying to find other societies , trying to find other societies and more sane to see if they could have the best ideas and more sane and more sane , and more sane , and more sane .
How to help people believe the inerent people to managing their emotivity .
And that research has taken me to the Great and ancient Rome .
Seeguites because I gave it in the circle and then back .
Nelil Great and anthic Rome -- people don 't seem to believe that creativity came to men , OK ?
And it was thought that creativity was this spirit , and that came up and and that came to men from a few people distant and known , for reasons and known , for reasons and known , for reasons and known .
The greaten were called these beyrings of creativity , " demand .
Socrate , wonderful , he believed to have a demon that elargy .
The Roands were the same idea , but they called that species of spirit .
The thing that is great , because the Rohands didn 't think that a genius was somebody particularly smart .
They think that a genius was this species of divine that was actually creating in the murs of an artist , a little bit like the Dobby , and that they come out of the argue of the artist job of the artist of the artist , and the result of that work .
Exial -- here is the distance of which is the distance of which is the distance of which you have to protecting from your work .
And they all knew that was that that it was what it was going to work , right ?
So the artists were protected by certain things , like , for example , like , for example , too narcisive , no ?
If your work was exciting , you couldn 't get the willing , all of course , they all knew that gesterday .
If your work failed , it wasn 't all colps , right ?
They all knew that it was your genius to be a inhate .
And so people han conceived creativity in Occident for a lot of time .
And then the Rinascition came and all changed this great idea ; we put the human being in the center of the universe on all the way of all the misters and and more and more to leave space creatures that writing from divinity .
This was the human human human human eximum and people started thinking that creativity came to think that creativity came from the ililikely .
And for the first time in the story , you start to referirt to this or that artist as a person in a genium .
And I have to say , I think it was a big mistain .
I think that allow someone , a simple person of creating to be like a recipient , the essence and the surprise of all the divins , creativins and creativins , and creativity , and eeternal and eternal and eeternal and you know , and you know , I think , and I think , and it 's a very large person to give to the fragile psysysysysysysyntherntheric . . .
It 's like to ask someone to ingoiate the sun .
It 's deform and demmand creates all these English and creates all these ingestible ingestifly .
And I think it was this pression to have an artists in the spent of 500 years .
And if this is true , and I think it 's the question , and I think it 's the question , and now ?
Can we do that diversity ?
Magarian comprement comprepreneuring of human relationship between human relationship and mystery creative comprement .
Or maybe no .
Maybe we can 't have 500 years of a rational thinking in a speech of 18 minutes .
And there 's probably people in the public that sollevers would be reading scientific sospspicing on the notion of , insuspent people in the way , they do that they follow people in the projects .
I 'm going to tell you all about this thing .
But the question I 'd like to take is -- why no ?
Why don 't I think in this way ?
Because it 's more sense of anything that ever ever heard to explained the explanation of creative process .
A process that , as anybody who ever caught us to do something -- so , all of this -- so , all here -- you know , you don 't have rationally .
And , in fact , it can be completely paranorful .
I did this initially with the recently Ruth Stone , who has 90s , but he was a poeter for the whole life and said that in his childhood and said that during his childhood , and he said that in the camps , and he felt it was in the room , and he fellow it out of if a poetime .
He said that it was like a frageful tracy .
And that was that they came back to her from the landscape .
It 's going to feel it , because he had to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able .
He knew that was a single thing to do at that point and was , " Weat as a matter . "
And so he 's going to reach the house and it was infollowed by this poem , and it would not have to get a piece of paper and a match and a match of fast , and the rate it , and the rate it on the page .
And , I couldn 't get enough enough , and it 's going to be faster and correcrecreceive and the poem and the poem and she had a poeer and she had continued through the landscape , trying to stay through the landscape , trying , like she said , " another poet . "
And then there were those times -- this piece of not dimentichy it , I never -- there were almost losing , right ?
So , he was going to go home and he was trying to the card and the poem was going to , and he said , and he was a math in the while he was going , and then said , that was like if you slow up with the other hand and the step .
It was the poem of the poem and reput it in his body and the spend and the sprage was on the page .
And in these cases , the poem would be presented on the page of the perfect word to the first word at the first word to the first word .
So when I feel thinking -- it 's exactly the equal -- it 's exactly the equal to my creative process .
Not all my creative process -- I 'm not a construct .
I 'm a mule , and my way to work is ; I 'll see it in the same orary every day and I 'm going to work and go up and I 'm going to be able .
But even I , in my heading testowine , I 've been able against that thing , sometimes .
And I think that 's also a lot of you have a han made .
You know , even if the work and ideas came to me from a certain source , you can 't be waste and waste .
And what is this ?
And how can we relate it in a way way we can 't make it perhaps your head , but , rather , that it makes us sans ?
And as I think about it , the best example , I have the Mayer Waits , which I 've been a different time in the day .
We were talking about this , and you know , Tom , for the greater part of the life was the incarnation of the artist host , trying to control , to cause these species of impults .
But then I 'm invecting , and a day while he was driving on a car in L.A. , changed everything for him .
It was going to go and all of a tract , and all of a tract , which is the inspiration , which comes in his head as it makes the inspiration , and the lifetive and the desider , but it doesn 't know how to take it .
It has no card , it 's not a math , it 's not a math registrator .
So I started to feel this species of old old old old old , and I 'm going to be able to lose , and I 'm going to be obsessed by this sessionate sessed by this sessionate sessionate sessionate .
I 'm not enough and I can 't do it . "
And instead of going to go into the panic , and I 'm going to stay .
It was the whole mental process and did something completely new .
And I just look at the sky and said , " Scell , I 'm not see that I 'm driving ? "
" Do you think that can write a song now ?
If you really want to exist , in a more opporter moment when I can take me me me .
And I walk up to importantly qualcanother today .
I started Leonard Cohen . "
And his process changed after this .
It wasn 't the work , the work was still obvious as .
But the process , and the fish that was removed it was releave when he was a genius , the genius that out of him , and the genius that was going back to where the other problems and libered it back from where he was , and I 'm going to be a whole thing and fall .
but wild this peculiar , wonderful bizarra , and this strange , and this strange and this strange and the outside that was not not Tom .
So how I feel that story about it to change a little bit even the way I work and I 've been able and I 've already saved .
This idea , I was the way I was written , Prega , " and I 'm going to be a disaster of those cave of the disperation of the disperation of which we 're doing on something and we can 't start thinking about something and we can 't start thinking that it 's going to be a disaster , which is the worst book .
Not just bad , right , right the worst book written .
And I started thinking about geping this project .
But then I remembered the Tom I talked to the air and I tried to .
So I went to the sleep and deep the ssettes and degree , and I reached my jech of the room .
And I said , " Senenches , what , both , you 're going to be a brilliant not going to be a brilliant not going to be able to be a very colame , no ?
Because as I see it I 'm putting everything I have , I don 't have this .
So if you want to be better , you have to presented and do your side .
Okay . But if you don 't do it , I don 't do it .
I 'm going to write the same because it 's my work .
And I want to favor that was recorded that I 'm presented to do my part of the time , " Because -- in the end is so , OK -- sacting in the North people were dances to dances in the dances of the dances of the sacts and music and the music and the hororrise to the hour , and and the way to the hour .
And they were always magnify , because the ballerins were great and they were great .
But every lot , so , something happened , and one of these artists had become actually transcendent .
And I know what you know , because I know you know , because I know you 're all seen , a performance .
It was like if the time , and the balls walked through a kind of land-up , and it was not doing anything else from the soldier , and it was all all of the way , but all the way you were all all the way .
And in the improviously , as a human human .
But it 's access to the divinity in the fuoes of the divinity of the divinity .
And when this happened , the people knew what was , people knew what was , they were called it .
They were the hands and they started doctor , " Allah , Allah , Allah , God God , God God God , God God God , God God , " God , God , God God , " God , God , " God , God God , God , God God God , " God God , God God , God God , God God God , God God God , God God , " God God God God , God God God God God God , " God God , God God , God , God God , " God , God , " God , " God , God ,
That 's God , you know .
And the Churious note -- when the More invaser 's Spaign , I was this abitude with them and the soouth of changes in the Allah , " Ole , " Ole , " Ole , " Ole , " Ole , " Ole , " Ole , " , " that you can still feel in the correct or in the flamk .
In Spaign , when a artist did something impossible and magic , " Allah , , Allah , I mean , I was a bad , I was a land-up , and I mean , it 's a last -- a land-like .
And it 's great because we need .
But , the problem is coming back to the day after , for the ballerine , when you smoke and discover that are the 11 of the morning of Martedday and the last thing of God is more .
It 's just a mortal with a gran bad ginockey , and maybe it 's not going to make that altel .
And maybe nobody will you go back to God , and what does it have to do with the rest of his life ?
It 's hard .
This is one of the most paorous recognize in a creative life .
But maybe it doesn 't have to be so angoal if you can 't believe , and if you can 't believe , the most extraordinary aspects of your being from yourself .
But it 's just that you 're going to be a prested by a inimaginable source of this team of the life that you have to go out to someone else when you finished .
And , you know , if we think about this way changes .
And so I started thinking about it , and it 's sure as I thought for a different months in the book that I 'm going to be able to be in my great dangerous , I 'm looking at my great successful ,
And what I have to keep telling me when I feel electured by this is , it 's not to have fear .
It 's not just to just your work .
Continua to present-a-side , any can be .
If your work is balls , balls .
If the divine , it assigned to you get a few kinds of wonderful , to a few kinds of wonderful kind of wonderful , for a moment through the foreign , then " Ole ! "
I do that same dance .
And " Ole ! " You know , you know .
I think , and I think I have to teach it .
" Ole ! " You know , just for having human love and willing to make a lot of human tals and make a tremendous .
Thank you .
Thank you .
June Cohen : Ole !
And as I 've already talked about some of these projects on the genome of what can significant and the discovery of new genes .
We 're starting a new pervent : we started digital biology and now now now to digital biology and now now now we 're both in a new phase of biology , designing and synthesized and synthesized life .
We 've always tried to ask great questions .
" What is the life ? " It 's something that many biologists have been tared to figure out vary vary vary .
We tried different approaches , we reduced to the minimi terms .
We 're digital to almost 20 years .
When we sequenced the human genome was treated to go from the analogical world of the digital world .
Now we ask : we can regenerate life , or to create new life from this digital universe ?
This is the map of a small organism , Mycoplasm , which is the species from the little bit of the genome of the little bit of those that can authorian ,
And we tried to reduce the genome to create a little bit more .
We can eliminate a hundred of genes of about 500 .
But when we look at his mapolic mapolic maps , is relatively simple than our .
It 's simple .
But when we look at all the genes that we can eliminate , one at the time , it 's very improbable that this can bring to a living cells .
So we decided that the only forth to provide was synthize this chromosoma in a way that we could be modify the understanding of some of these fundamental questions .
So we started the adventure of " can we be synthesize a chromosoma ? "
It can be the chemistry to make these great molecules that we 've never been able to create before ?
And in case , we can we make a crossly , can we make a ceemosoma ?
A chromosoma is just a piece of chemical material .
The speed with which we 're able to digitalize life is growing to remote .
Our capacity to write the genetic code , instead of , but it 's really better , but it 's really better .
And our falls are results to a curve .
We started about 15 years ago .
The process has required many spaced , starting with a bioetic revision before we start with the prims .
But we found that synthesize DNA is very hard .
There are thousands of thousands of machines in the world that produces are small segments of 30 landle , and it 's a degenerative process .
So we had to develop a new method to assembling these framments and correcrecrectors .
And this was our first tentative , in the digital genome of the digital genome of Phi X 174 .
It 's a little virus that kills .
We designed the correction of the mistaination of the mistakes and get a molecule of DNA to about 5,000 lectating .
The interesting part is when we took this piece of chemical material , and we put it in bacteria , and we 've got it in bacteria , and they started reading this code and produring the viral particles .
The viral particles have then been releave by cells , they 're back and they were destructed .
I talked about recent with a CEast oil industry , saying that they 're certainly understood that they 're certainly understood this model .
They have more than you .
We believe this is a situation where the software can really build his own hardware in a biological system .
But we wanted to do things in great .
We wanted to build the entire crumosoma .
I 'm over 580 mile lecting of genetic code .
So we thought we built it in the size of viruses , so we can change the cassets of viruses , so we can change the cassets of a living cells .
The design is crucial , and if we start with digital information in a computer , these have to be very accurate .
When we sequenced this genome for the first time in 1995 to the standard was of a mistakes for every 10 mile .
We found , 30 mistaurable , 30 mistaining , 30 mistainable sequence , we would never be able to do it .
A part of the process is designing segments that are 50 lecting to build substant with all of the other segments of 50 lecting to build sounity and more little working on the work together .
We 're going to make the unique elements here .
You know , you know , we 're reading that we put in the filify .
Think , we think , we have a clumn code on four lecting : A , C , C , GG and T.
And the ones of those reading spent in the spent of 20 friendly , and there 's a specific order of the lectate of every friendly .
So we can use the genetic code to write words , frases , thinking .
What we did in the beginning was autographed .
Some have been delusi from the fact that it was not poem .
We designed these segments to just a few years , just a doctor with me .
There are a tiny that they repay them and put them .
And we started assembling to be able to injecting with segments , and a cendenenables , unended up to 24 miles in a way to get 72 miles to them back to 72 mile .
And we 've made these segments in abonance so we 've made these smounted to create a very straight processing to a very robustobustobustostobed -- as you 'll see in a minute .
We 're trying to automatize the process .
So , this seems the tabellone of the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of a bottom of the bottom of the bottom of a bottom of the bottom of a bottom .
When we get these very long , more than 100 miles , more than 100 miles , they will not grow up in the E.
It 's coming to the modern of the modern of the molecular tools .
So we 've been considered others .
We knew about another mecchanism called a recombination omologa , which in biology to repair the segments .
Here 's an example .
This organism , called Deinococcus radiooococcus , can absors three million rad .
You can see in the digrimmma is destructed .
In 12 -- 24 hours is reabled up exactly how it was before .
There are thousands of organisms that they can do it .
These organisms can sitting in this organisms .
They can live in vacuum .
I 'm absolutely that life is in space , and you feel places to find new environments of water .
And the real , NASA showed it that this is .
This is a picture of the molecule that we built up with these processes , just using these approaches , just using the re-serated design to insert .
The light-hassemble .
This picture was not taken with a microscope , but with a microscope , but with a microscope .
It 's a very great tremendous that we can see the with a microscope .
These are photos that are a time of six seconds .
This is the advertiation we did a little time ago .
I 'm over 580,000 lecting of genetic code .
It 's the greatest molecule of a definite structure that we 've ever created by man .
It 's a lot of the sudden molecular weight .
If you stamp it with a caratter 10 without spaces , they would like 142 to transcaught this code .
Now , how do we work ?
Of course , a virus is a virus is a game .
It 's a little bit more complicated when they use bacteria .
It 's simply also when it 's about cell eucariods like our : you can just be the nucleo and insert another , which is basically the process of cloning .
In the bacteria , the bacteria is instead of integrated in the cells , but we recently demonstrate that we 're able to do a sundated traditional cell to another and active activity .
We could be a cromosoma by a species .
The two are different as men from the tops .
We added some gene and more in a way that they can decide what to do for this ckromosoma .
The sand the enables in the way to kill all the proins .
And when we put it in the cells was stupendomed -- and you 'll appreciate our graphic , and you 're going to be in the cells .
And we started thinking that we can 't go beyond , but we tried to get more in there .
This is one of the greatest clumecchanisms .
We found that many species have added a second or a third chromosoma , and added in a thousand new tracts in a thousand new tracts to that species .
So who think about evolution as a gene and the time you have to the evolution of the biology of the biology .
They 're in the enabmes called me " enjoyment , which advil to say that they 're going to be the DNA .
The chromosoma that was in the cells that it was in the cells .
The cell pha-cococococom that we put it .
It 's expressed , and he recognized the other clumn material as a material material , and we have the rown , and we 've got the back with only cells and the new cell and the new cell .
It 's become blue because of the genes we 've insered .
And in a short leep , all the characteristics of a species are going to be done , and it 's transformed in a new species , based on the new software that we 've been serious in the cells .
All the proin has changed , and when we read the way , and when we read the genetic code of exactly what we have spring .
Now , this could look at the genetic genetic , but altering software , we can change the things in a way .
Now , I 've already explained that there is not about geny -- but I 've been in a half million years and a half of evolution , and I said that maybe we 're going to create a new version of Cambriana in which will be a new species of the Cambriana in which will be a new species on this digital process .
Why do that ?
I think it 's enough to be that when we think we need to our necessity .
We 're going to move from six billion and a half billion in the next 40 years .
Right for an example : I was born in 1946 .
Now there are three people on the planet for each none existent in 1946 ; in 40 years , there will be four .
We 're doing problems now at food , and a fresh and clean , medical and wine for six billion and a half billion people .
It 's going to be more than billion .
We 're going to be more than five billion carbon , more than 30 billion bariles of olio .
That means that cent millions of baries in day .
When we try to find biologists , or any kind of process to repay them , it 's going to be a huge challenge .
We have to get all the whole of CO2 from these materials that 's going to be in the atmosphere .
At day today , thank you very much scientific discovered in the world , we have a database with about 20 million genes , and I like to think that are designed for the future .
The electronic industry is just a dozen of components , and think of how many different they come out .
Our limitations are principles of the biological data and our imagination .
Now we have techniques , thank you very quickly than a synthesization , in order to create what we call genomics .
We can build a big robot that can produce a million clumn in the day .
Think of processing these 20 million genes or to try to get to get either , and to make more biologists , new vaccines , we can change , thank , we can change , thank with a little team , and create more biology now now that in the last 20 years of science .
And it 's just a standard .
We can choose for the possibility of survival , or production or co-carburant , production of vaccepts .
This is an instantanea of some software programmed that we 're working for being able to seats and design species to make us us and design species .
Well , we don 't know how they will be .
We know exactly how it is their genetic code .
We 're focusing on the carburant generation .
You see that you can extract the gram was a wellanol experiment .
We have a second and third generation that they 're going to use enough to the sorts of cold , as the highest value of the highest value of butanol .
But the only way that biology can have a great impact without increasing for the food , and the limitation of food and limitary the constititarne would transforming CO2 in the matter , for design cells that they can reach this to design cells that can be able to design cells that they can reach this , and we think we can have pricarburant .
The solar light solar with CO2 is a metodo-- but in our discovered in the world , we found different metods .
This is a organism that we 've described in 1996 .
It 's about 2,500 feet of the water , about 2,500 feet of the temperature of the water .
They 're using CO2 using a molecular molecular molecular as a source of energy .
We 're trying to understand if we can indoed CO2 , which can do it . It can be translated to be translated to the CO2 in carbons , to guiding this process .
So , we short think we can be able to increase what the question of " which is the question of " which is Nooks of the goal of the goal of repair the goal of the oil industry .
Exxxture . If you can 't do it from TED , where can you ?
It would be a main of energy .
And we 're working for using the same metods to create vaccines .
You saw this year with influence , we 're always going back to a year and with a dollar in less when it 's about the win the right .
I think what you can change constructing vaccines in a little ange .
And this is how the future could start looking at it , now , the tree of evolution , and I was to accelling the evolution of the intetic cyyyourself , and infinally cell cells .
We are so much from the best people .
Our discovered is to do a way of living enough to try to do it . Thank you very much .
And I 'm going to see , the faster , the most fundamental job , the new technology that we 've taken to Microsoft in follow a year ago . This is Seadragon . This is Seadragon . This is Seadragon .
It 's a environment where you can interact is in local level that remote with a huge amount of data .
We 're seeing a lot of gabyte of digital photos with a kind of phoom and continuous , for a very fastamic photos , aving images like we want .
And it doesn 't matter how much much much much of information that we see , how great these things are like these data or images .
Most are common photographs , but this for example , is a degree scanning from the library of the Congress of the Congress , and I reenter in the gm of 300 megapixel .
It doesn 't make any difference because the only thing that you have the prestations of a system like this is the number of pixel on your screen in any time . It 's also an architecture .
This is a book , like this is a whole book , of the data of this is not images .
This is Casa desolate of Dickens . Every colonna represented a capital .
And to show you that 's just about the tbook and not images , we can do something like this , to see that is a real real representation of a real picture .
It could be a little artificial way to read a book .
It 's not the advice .
This is an example of the most realistic example . This is a number of the Look .
Every picture is the beginning of a seition .
And it 's really the pleasure and the becomes to read the real version of a magazine or a magazine , which is for nature of a molteplus , which is for a molteplus .
We also did something with the corner of this number in particular , of the Look .
We 've created a badvertitising to solutionary -- much more than that you use in a normal advertising -- and we 've insered in the contail .
If you want to see the careful cars of this car , you can see here .
Or other models , or even the specific specific models .
And this really shows some of these ideas to eliminate the limititations of space space space .
We hope that this means that we can say a pop-up and other porcheries , and more similar , not to be necessariarily .
Of course , the map is one of the most obvious applications for this kind of technology .
And on this is not just to lose time , if we don 't have contribute to give in this field .
These are all the street in the U.S. subvegetospacy of NASA .
So now we go to something else .
This is actually actually the right right right now , you can go to see .
This is a project called Photosynth , which combine two different technologies .
A lot of the U.S. is a very interesting research in the computer , in the world 's very interesting computers in the world 's very interesting , a student of Washington , with the aid of Washington , with the Seitz of the URick Szeliski of Microsoft Rick Szelisi .
And it 's from the web , I managon to Seadragon .
You can see it when we do this kind of screen , where we can go from a picture and have this kind of experience to the other kind of experience .
But the spacy of the images of this effectively a significant .
The algorithms of visualization of computers have recorded these images together , in the way that corresponresponse to places that the replicate of the Brr. The Br. The Montagne Roccious dog on the Montagne Roccious dog , and these things are in the destanding of a slide of imaging , and these things are all in the time .
I don 't know if I have time to show you some other environment .
There are a lot more spacy .
I want to go directly to one of the original data of Noah-- and this prototyping of Noahsynthroy-based , that we 've done for the first time time , to show you what I think is really the key key to show that the key technology , Photosynthroad this technology , Photonth . And it 's not necessarily obvious ,
We had to worry about the things and forth .
This is a reconstruction of Noter 's codramoning , and I 'll be a Flickr . Basta digites , and you get images of the types of the neighbors and on the pictures of these coni . And I said , and I said , and I said , and you know , and I said ,
So they are all images in the Flickr and they were all connected to this way .
And it 's possible to navigate in this very simple way .
You know , I never thought I would end to work for Microsoft .
It 's very gratificent to get this kind of account here .
I think you can see that it 's about a lot of different fotocameras : from those of the SLR , a number of meaning , a meananances , a meaning , in this environment .
And if I can , I try and try and look at those more strange .
Many of them are blogged by doing it .
So , there 's a few of photographs -- it 's a series of photographs -- it .
This is a Noter of Notle Dame registrate .
We can move from the poster to the physical view of this environment .
The essential point is that we can do with social environment . This is now taking data from the interal , from the internal of the internal , from the visual point of view -- and connects to all those data together together .
All those pictures become connected , more than the sum of parts .
You have a model of the entire entire entire which emerging .
Think of the work of Stephen Lawler 's work of Stephen Lawler on Earth .
It 's something that grow in complexity , as people are using , and the people who are using , and the which vantages of the use .
They have a photos with a meat with other people .
If someone comes the idea of contrast to get all these sorts of saying , my catch of the name of Noter Dame improvised Dame improvised , and I can use how to be able to be able to use of the way to the space , in that metaphs , in that metaphor , using the photos of , and they have a kind of a cross-momoon .
Of course , a consequence of all of this is virtual models of every side of the interesting of every side of the land , collecting not just to live and and and images and similar images and similar images and similar images and similar images and similar images and similar images and similar images and similar images and similar images and similar imagination and similar pictures and the satellitation .
Milles .
Chris Anderson : I realized what your software is that your software to us is that in a certain point in the next years , in the next years , all the world will be practically connected with ?
BAA : Yeah . What 's doing is doing in practical .
It 's creating hyperlink , if you want , in images .
And it 's doing it in the contail of images .
The thing becomes very interesting if you think about recheable information semanties that many of these images are possible .
As when you do a search of images on the web , you digital page and the tape on the web has a lot of information about the images .
Now , what happens if that picture you put your pictures ?
So the amount of interconnects and the amount of rich and the amount of race that is really huge . It 's a effect of the network .
CA : Blaise , it 's really amazing .
BAA : I thank you very much .
One of the main of the wind and one of the phetnographics of the ethnographics is the order of the anti-tradied , and who has the anti-tradions , in the wind , the fall of the time , the fall of the time , the fall of the falls of the wind , the fall of the way , and the gave the plant ,
Basti thinking that the monkeys Jaguar viance , and the idea that the Via Lattea , or that the monitor that in Himalaya , or that in Himalaya , or that in Himalaya , to remember the importance of the way , of the way , in the way , and the idea that the world that the world that we live in the world , but it 's just a sense , but it 's just a way , is a way , but it 's just a model of reality , but it 's just a way ,
the consequence of a particular , of the adaptative to the adaptative , and a lot of generations ago .
And , of course , we all share of the essential tracts .
We all do . Everybody do .
We are subjects to start .
We have to death the inexorability of death , so we don 't surprised if we 're sleep and we 're going to --
We all have an art .
What 's the particular one of the song , the rhythm of every culture .
It 's not matter that they think the Chrian of Borneo , or the Weat , or the Haiti , or the Kaisus , or the Kaisudden of the Kenya , or a settle in the Sahara .
He was my company , he was my company in the desert of a month ago , or a liffflip in the world .
All these populations have been teaching us that there are other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , other ways of moving in the world .
And if you reflect a bad thing . It 's a concept that can give you hope .
And , in the myric of cultures of cultures of the world creating a spiritual and cultural life that 's important for the well-being of the planet and it is important for the well-being of the planet as the way the neighborhoods .
And you can think about this ragnospsphere , as a nine and you can define the nine of all the concepnosphere is a total of all the conception of all concepts , intuitions , intuition , intuitions are able to be from human imagination of consciousness to be from human imagination .
The etnosphere is the fantastic pathcare of humanity .
It 's the symbbox of what we are and what we can be in how inquisitive .
And as the biosphere was a gravly consumed , as a successful nosphere and unfortunately , and it 's very quickly .
Nobody biologist , for example , it would say that 50 percent of all species is on the organ extinction because it 's fat , or the most apocalitted , in the hypopocalitten diversity -- and it 's not near to be near in the world of the most optimistic -- that 's the cultural diversity .
The indeed of all that is , of course , the perditation .
When you 're born 6,000 languages on this planet .
A language is not only composite by a vocabulary or a series of rules .
A language is the human spirit of human spirit .
It 's the half of all culture comes in the material world comes in the material world .
Every language is a forest of the mind , a thought , a thought , a thought , a thought , a spiritual ecosystem of the spiritual .
And of those 6,000 languages , as we are here seat at at the terey , the less half of the children .
They 're not teaching kids , the which means that it 's not to say , at least that is not that there are death .
What is there 's more tribe to be able to be able to be the last to talk , of the last to talk , of the people to move the saggeity of the saggeity of the children ?
This was in some of the world of somebody in some of the world in some of the world in a few two weeks , and a door and door with them in the tomba tomba language language .
And I know someone who will say , " It 's not better like this ?
The world would not be a better place if we talk about all the same language ? "
We talk kogs .
You 're going to be a tract thing that you can 't talk about their language .
I would like to do a journey through the nine .
a little journey in the etnosphere to give you a source of what we 're losing .
Many of us deal that when I say , " different ways of existing , " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " different ways of existing .
We make this bimber Barasana , in Amazonia , in Amazonia , the popular of anacond , which credit mixed the sacond of the sacond of the sackers of sacred sacred sacred .
It 's a popular that it 's not in the way , it 's going to be able to distinguess , because the time it 's identifed in the forest , which dipends the popular .
They have a strange language and a maker , he said , " He said , " Desogamia " : " You have to save a person who talks about a different language .
And all that has been in the past mitologic , yet , in the time , in these families are that in these families and existed in the month that they 're talking about six or seven language .
They limitate to listening and then they start talking .
We make one of the most interesting tribe with which I 've been lived , the Waorani of Ecuador an incredible popular people who had the first contact in 1958 .
In 1957 five missionaries have been tented a construct construct .
They did that the top of the photographs that they were reported , and they were going to reach that the popular of the forest , that was not seen anything bi-dimensional dimensional .
They collected the picture of the Earth , they were standing on a shape or a shape and , they were not going to be able to be able to be the deavor , and they killed the five missionaries with the lance .
But the Waorans don 't kill the strange .
They kill them in them .
Our mortality was caused by their same .
We 're eight generations and we found two cases of morning and we found two cases of morning and when we were initiated that one of them was invecting them , and then they killed it , and then they killed it the same .
The cruators were able to recognize the animal , to 40 step and recognize the species .
In the first ' 80 , I was assigned a really interesting job when my professor , I was really interesting when my professor , if I wanted to go to Haiti to Haiti to the babies of the sgreat-based , and I imposed Tonton Macoooks and Tonton Macoooks and I was used to make the cool of the cool of the Woms and .
For a sense of the myraologist , I would have to make the culture Vodoor , which the Vodoor is not magner .
It 's pretty much about a complex view of the world .
Very interesting .
If I ask you to say the great religions of the world , what would you say ?
Cristianesimum , Islam , Buddism , Ebraism , etc . .
A continent is always left out , and thinking that Africa has no religious not has no religious religious . And instead of yes and the Vodoor is not the other that distilance of these religious concepts in the tragic tragic tragic .
What 's interesting that makes the voodoor is the intest relationship between life and life and death .
So the vision they hide to the spirits .
The spirites can be invoced by Grande Acqua , they foundance to the dance of the dance of the vial way that 's the time to the way that 's going to become the way .
And so , for this voodoers love to say , " You know , you 're going to talk about God .
We say , " We 're going to say God . "
And the moment you 're a bad thing ?
So you 'd have these incredible events : following the voodoor in the state of trance that tomas they were impunted to a strong demonstration of the mind when it 's catalized in a state of extreme .
And all the popules I 've been lived the most extraordinary of the Sierra Nevada 's Kogi of the Sierra Nevada 's in the Sierra Colombisical .
It was a sending of the ancient civilization that once they were living on the caraibs of Colombia in the conquatic , popular , the popular of the sorts of vulanic plus to the plant of the plant playing on the plants .
In a continent continent of blood , this popular , this popular was ever conquisted by the spagreed .
But they 're also now governed by a clero , but they have been a very extraordinary .
The young people following up with the families to three or four years , and live secreating in a world of good cool and homs in a crugs in the bottom of the ice of the ice of the glaciers for 18 years .
Two of the noper nine years of the Grance of deal with the nodamental noves months of the ageful , I was now metaphor in the the U.Mdddad .
And so , in this time , they 're acculated to their society , values that predict that their preglglaciers and only their preglaciers , or to say the equilibrium of the equilibriecological .
At term of this initiation , they 're improvised out and for the first time in their life , at the age of 18 years , they see a very active , and in that active value , when the sun the sun of the first nose of the beautiful values of the beautiful values of the fall of the time , what they 've learned in the theory is , the predict of the fer . The pret of the first , and he 's going to go back and say ,
" Very as ? Proprise as I said .
It 's study . It 's study you . "
They call it greators and say that we , the bunch of the world .
This level of intuition is extremely important .
When we think about ingene and the invote in the invote , and the old story of the noble namable , which is a concept of the wildness of the neighbor magic magic magic , and we say that people are more neighborhood to the Earth .
The popular popular is not indebulites .
There is no space for these things in the palud of the Astops of the gelids of Tibet , but thank thank you and the time and the rites , they created a mystics of the Earth can be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to because it 's the human conscious .
What does it mean ?
It 's saying that a girl of the Ande that growing up that the mountains is a very different destine that 's a human being destiny , and it will have a different human human human being foundly and it will have a different deep than a Montana that place in a little bit of the Montana that 's called a Montana that 's 's a mountains of rock in the mountain of rock of rock that 's cavated .
That 's the dimour of a spirit or a mineral , it was irrifflier .
What 's interesting is that the metaphor and the natural world .
I grew up in the forests of Columbia British , credating that forests to be cut .
And this has me a different human being in the world from my friends Kwakiutl that credidimour of Hukukukukuk and the bis the histories of the world , we 'll be the northern of the world , we 'll be the northern of the world , the spirites that are going to be in the Hamsa .
If you start to look at that these cultures can create reality , you can start to get some of their feelings .
I 've been taken this picture to aprile in the North Amazonia .
Maybe some of you have heard about the ayahuash , the most powerful stance psycoactive .
What makes the ayahuasking is not the potential of the substance of the substance of the substance , but his elaboration . It 's composing .
On a side , this liana law , which is a series of carboline , harm and harm , slightly , slightly fallucinogenenenogenenenoes .
Prepreneuring the only plants , it has a little bit that altera little bit of the consciousness , but it 's mixed with the fleaves of a family of caffee .
This plants , a lot of the sptamine , very similar to the serotonin , methyltryptamine , methoxydimethydimethoxtin .
If you 're ever seeing Yanomami , you 'll be a different stance that they do from a different species , anchor a a pamine , and it 's contail .
And I think that polar on for the nose is a little bit like to be sparated by a pink of the winds of the electricity of the solution of the electricity .
I was often to my professor , Richard Evan Shultes , the man who watened the psychedelic discovery of the fungi of the load of the fungi in the 1930 in Mexico .
And I think my tesis , you can 't be sleep these tripptamine as well , because if you 're not able to tell no one of being hallucinated . They can 't be a unorucinated because they are dense because they are dened by a fast that 's drugs , because they are denly , in the intestine ,
It 's possible to be just if they 're only only only only if they sunds with other stances that denian densy .
Now , it 's the bel : the cool that are in this liana are in this liana are injury , of the same kind of necessary to potential the same kind of necessary to be able to be a fall of 80,000 species , like these people are going to find two deales , like these people are not like these two deaths , but if if you combinate in this way , they create a version of the sorts of the sorts of parts ?
We use the great eufactural eufactural and the mistake , which can revehiced .
But if we ask the Indians , they 'll tell us " The piant . "
What does it mean ?
This tribes , the Cofan , and he has 17 variety of ayahuasking , which distinct in the forest , and that we would go into the same species .
If we ask how they will stbilized their tassonomy , they will say , " I was thinking about the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest of the rest , and if you ask them " No .
The solution is : they take the 17 variety in a night of the land-to-board and each of a different sorts of a different tiny .
And this is not a laurea in Harvard , but it 's much more interesting that contact stami .
Now , [ [ applaushes , the problem is that even the ones of us who have to heart pittoresks , but in some way , in some way we have a real way to our world , and step beyond .
In fact , the 20th century , in 300 years , it 's not going to remember for his own innovations , but rather as the way we stopped and we have to habled and we have to habrimmed and we have spent or accepted spent of the diversity of the diversity of the planet . Now the problem is not the change .
All cultures through the seats have been involved in a dance for new possibility of life .
And the problem is not the technology .
The Indians Sioux have no stopped in the arch and they freceived in the arch and they freceived as American American American people have not stopped and caving .
It 's not the change or technology that are threatening the integrity of the nosphere . It 's the power .
The hard hard to the domination .
And if you give a look at the world , I 'll find that these are not destinated in the world , you know that they 're not destinated .
They 're creatures and dynamics are spints out of the existence of hythms that they go beyond their ability to adapaptation .
I know that 's disbottom in the pain of the Penan Penan --
a popular no---bunch , in the soul of the soul of the soul , a popular popular , and now reduced to a generation , and now re-dot to the reve of the fiume of the fiums of the fiume that seful , where you can see the fifiume that seal , where the nat the Mar Canese Merian Malgives the nets , where the nat the land-up ,
You know , I 'm going to reempize the wood dream with the forest .
Or , in the case of Yanomami , are the disease that are the discovery of the gold .
If we move on on on the Tibet , where I 'm doing a lot of research , where I 'm doing a lot of the political domination .
As you know the genocide , the physical physical , is a popular level , but the nocise , the distroyle , the destroy of life , not just not only is not just constructed , but advanced in certain environments , because it 's a part of development .
And you can 't understand the suffering of the Tibet of the beginning .
I 've been very high school in China in China in China in China through Tibet sudoriental , come to Lhasa young , I got to Lhasa young , but only come to Lhasa , I realized what we 've heard about .
6,000 monuments re-bunch and cenjoy .
1.2 million people killed by the Cultural Rivolution .
The father of this guy was ascritical in the Panchen Lama .
The one that means that it was killed to the tempi of Chinese invasion .
I 'm worse with Santity in Santity during the diaspora that brought the popular in Nepal .
Smother was impried and his colps and his colps was to be rich .
It was brought to carry in the age of two years in the age of two years in his gonna because it would not have been living without him .
The sister , which has done the same , it was mitted in reeducation .
A day has inavailed a coffigurant in the Mao and , for this transgression , was mitted to the jump , was mitted to the seven years .
The pain of Tibet can be inherate , but the spirit of the popular of the popular of the popular of the popular .
And in the end , all of all , you reduce to a choice .
We want to live in the world world 's the monooonia or want to account the world polymption of diversity ?
The great anthropologists Mead , before he said that his greatest pair was that , in our friendly way , in our friendly , in our friendly , we don 't only see the entire gene of human reducing , but a day , a day , we 'll see from a day , but a day , a day , we 'll be other possibility .
And it 's ubillion to remember that our species is existed for 600-year-old .
The Rivolution Neolitic , who gave us the agriculture , which has been fight us to the cult of seed , which has been able to fight the poetime of the sler , creating the gerarchieving , and we talk about 10,000 years ago .
modern world industrialized has been in 300 years .
And that 's a story that we don 't suggests that we have the answers that we have to deal in the millennia to come .
When these miriads of cultures of the world is asked what human cultures , they said to be human , residentions with 10,000 voices .
And it 's in these answers that we all rised the possibility to be what we are : a conscious species , which has to make all the popular way all the people and all the given can fioring . And there are great moments of the way .
I 've been taken this picture on the North of the Baffin , when I went to the whales of the Inuit , and this man , Olaya , and this man , Olaya , and this man , Olaya , and he said , the wonderful story of his grandfather .
The government government has not always been given with the Inule popular Inuit and in the ' 50s to stbiliar our supremimatial , we have them in colonies .
The grandfather of this man refuted .
The family , I 'm teming for his life , and he took all the time , and all his attle .
You have to know that Inuit , they don 't have the cold , they don 't get the freedom .
The pattins of sleep in origin was made of fishing ball .
The grandfather of this man had not been intimidly in the library or from the libraries that suffering .
It 's sgattaired , it 's calated the panks in the skin of photos and defecated in your hand . When the fell you do it , they 've got to make a lama .
It 's spring on on the poinds of this coltelem , and when they come up and they solid , he killed a dog .
It has been cut the dog and created a brillier , with the cassleta , has been imbrilliant , and it 's been disappeared on the bunch , coltelds , and it 's been on the brought .
We want to talk about caving with nothing ? [ Risate ] And this , in different ways , [ Applausi is the symbole of the resilience of the popular Inuit and all the populations of the world .
Nella 1999 , the government government reach it has redied to the Inuit of the world of an area of territory of a great territory of the great California and Texas a together .
It 's their new paria . It 's called Nunut .
It 's a territory . Contrologists all the resources .
One example of how a natione-standy example of how a natione-state .
And , to finish , I think it 's rather obvious at least who who 's been in these remote remote in these sea , and they realized that they don 't have to remote .
For someone is home .
They represented seedtions of human imagination that are going to sleep in the time . And for all of us , the dreams of these children , they become part of the geography of hope .
And to finish , we know Geographic we are convince that politics will never come to anything .
We believe that the polemies --
[ [ [ Applausi ] They don 't persuasive , but we believe that the stories can change the world , and maybe we are the best institution to tell the stories of the world . Every month , 35 million visits own reaches .
156 countries spent to put our television .
Our revists are lets from millions of people .
Our work is travel in in the nosphere to bring our audience in a places of wonderful cultural places from which they 're going to be able to bunch and , they 'll be able to , and they will be able to , and they will be able to find a way of the diversity of the diversity of the diversity of , and we have to find a life in a world , and we have to find a plural world and multicultural and multicultural and and the way ,
where the saggeity of all the popular can contribute to our well-being collective welltial .
Thank you .
I 'm going to tell you about some things that I hope you 've written in this book that I hope you 've been and provered to proverse some of the case , in case , you would not noticed them .
I want to start with what I call " " " " " " " " " " " " " "
The dogma official thing ?
The dogma official dogma of all the Western industrial society , the official , " If we want to massive to be the well-being of our citizens , " The way to do that is massive to be the individual freedom . "
The reason is , in fact that liberty is in the fact that liberty is in the same value , is predictious , is the essential to human beings .
And then we 're in fact that if we 're libs , each of us can act for all that massive , and each one of us can act for all that massive , no one that we decided in our name .
The way to massive freedom is massive choice .
The people choices people , more , and more , and more or is their benedom , and more , and more or is their beneful .
This , I think , it 's so deeply roadicated in the society that nobody would be able to put it in the doubt .
And it 's also deeply deeply in our lives .
I 'm going to show you some examples of what progress has made possible .
This is my superbusiness . It 's not particularly great .
I loved a simple note on condments .
In my supersupermarket , there are 175 condments , without constanting 10 variety of the photos that you can buy for the phanants that you can buy for a huge stance of conditions in the inct of the stances that nobody of 175 .
This is the superbusiness .
And then you go to the snice of electronic electronic stereo : casse , the lector , the ladier .
And in this single one snice of electronic , there 's a great number of audio components .
We can make six million and a half a half of different combinations that there are in a cycle .
You have to admit that there is a very large choice .
On the world of communications .
Once , when I was a child , they could get all the telephotos , and they were forced by the mom Bell .
It was a phone , it didn 't buy it .
A consequence of this , the other thing , was that the phone never .
These days are going to go .
We have a variety of telephones , especially between the phones , especially between the phones .
Here 's the phones of the future .
My favorite is that in the middle , the MP3 , tapeli of the nose , and the forced and the forced me .
If you don 't have seen in the neighborhood in the house , you 're ben to be able to be able .
And what happens is that people go into the negogots and make this question . And you know , what is the answer is " No . "
It 's not to buy a cell phone that doesn 't do it .
So , in other aspects of the life that are much more important than the acquiful of the same plosion of choices .
Axxblood : It 's not in the United States that you go from the doctor and the doctor you have to do .
Instead , I go from the doctor , and the doctor says , " OK , we could do A , or B , " Again , " Again , " Again , " Brich these well-up . What you want to do ? "
You know , " Dooter , what I should I do ? "
And the doctor says , " A has these beneficians and B has these beneficians and B has these beneficians and these sks . "
" What do you want to do ? "
And you rebate , " Dotore if she was , what would you do ? "
And the doctor , " But I 'm not her . "
The result result to the result of maled , " , " expression that makes a beautiful thing .
But actually , it 's not that one to move the fish and responsibility of the decisions of somebody who knows something , ois the doctor , to somebody else else else -- and it 's maled -- and so not in the ideal condition to decisions .
There 's a huge marketing of products , you know , and you know , and you know , if you think it 's no sense , because if you think you can 't buy them .
But if we can 't buy them , why can you get them , why can you get them ?
The answer is that they want to be domorning , we call the doctor to ask us to change the rich .
And what 's so fundamental as we have identity to be a question of choice , as you see in this vignel , " We don 't want to forced children . They ceat their sets to the right now , " We don 't know more an identity : we have to invent .
And we can reinvented how many times us .
The one that means that every morning , to say , you know that kind of person want to be .
It was a family and the maker , a time the time , a time the common , and they were liked to anyone , which was that there was that there there was a flip , and he started to get the more price .
The only real choice was with people , not when , and even even even what do after .
Odly , all that 's really to play .
I 've been very smart students , and I do 20 percent in less than a time .
And because they don 't have a brilliant , because they 're not degree .
but why am I impensive , I mean , I would say , " I would you say , " Doo ?
" Do you get me more later ?
They 're interrogatives logiving .
And they try to answer these questions , even if this implation is not able to get the tune and not get a bel vote to my examples .
And they have to do that . They 're important questions .
Now , the work : We 're lucky , like Carl soon , because technology have allowed us to work every day , from every day , from every angle of the planet , translation of the Hotel Randolph .
And I 'm talking , there 's a correct , and I 'm not going to tell anybody where , where the WiFi works .
I don 't say it because I want to use it .
What does that mean , this incredible liberty of choice that we have to do it , continually , if we have to work or not .
We can go to see our son played town , with the cell phone in a club , Blackberry in the other , and the notextly , and the notextly , and the notear .
And even though they 're all spent , every minute that we see our son , we 're also asking , " I have to say to this called ? "
" I have to answer this email ? I have to say this letter ? "
And when the answer is " no , this makes the experience of your own son , very fun of your son , very fun from what would be in other conditions .
So , from any part of all the things , and great materials , things and great materials and life , life is a question of choice .
Once the world was this : Ovreal , there were some possibility , but it was a question of choice .
The world of today is that , the world 's dilemma is , " It 's a positive thing , or negative ? "
The answer is Surging .
The latats of positive . So I 'm going to talk about the negative of the negative .
This is a choice of two effects of the people .
The first , I talk about it is that produced paralysally , is that produced .
And so , a lot of the tools that you get , it becomes very hard to do it .
I give you an example : a study of a meaning of py-penguess .
A connects of the Vances of the Sitches , the giant ant company , the giant of a million clients of pair , with about a million clients in 2,000 different company .
What she found is that for every 10 solutions that are offer , the percentage of adesion , the percentage of two percent .
With 50 source , there is 10 percent in less than adesions than adesions in less than they have available to be five . Why ?
Because with 50 four-fall of the wheel , is maledly hard to decide , and choice is remandate is remandying .
And I still asked them , and again , I asked the tomormorning , and of course , and of course , and of course , I would never come .
You can 't just mean that these work from old old old , they will be able to dogs because they don 't have enough money , it means that the decision is so ostics that alone that lose the danger of work .
It 's not talking , they 're losing , they 're losing to five dollars for year from the dator of work , which would be a real standand-up .
So the paralis is a consequence of having a bunch of choices .
And I think that makes the world so .
" And to finish , for the eternity : keternal , send or maionese ? "
You would take the right decision , if it 's for the right decision , if it 's for the eternity , right ?
You don 't want to choose the wrong , and you know , and neighborhood condition .
So this is the first effect . The second is that we can be able to avoothers and do a choice , at the end , we 're less sodddisdisdisdisdisdisappears .
And this for different reasons .
One of these is that with many conditions , which you know , if you know , you know , if you can 't be perfect , it 's easy imagine that you could have been better . And what happens is that the alternative imagination would be better . And what happens is that the alternative imagination of choice , and the repeeeating of choice , and the recenturied by decision of the decision , and the sodddisfer ,
And when it was a very good decision .
There are more choices , more is easy to displeased than any detail that 's insodddisdisfacing .
And , there 's what economists call it expensive .
Dan Gilbert has closed very well stamats like the value that we 're going to depends on what we 're confront .
And then , when there are many options , it 's easy to represent the characternative of the alternative alternative ards that you have choice .
Here 's an example . I 've been with all the ones that are not New York .
But that 's what you probably think you would probably think .
There is this pair from Hamptons .
A place of the lushed .
It 's all sorts . Ottma day . It 's all for them .
Not nothing . But what he thinks is , " Well , maldying , is Agottle . "
" All my neighbors in Manhattan is . "
" I could talk about the front of the house . "
And I 'm going to go to the idea that 's persent -- every day -- every day -- the possibility of parking where you want .
The constantly opportunity to diminute the soddisfation for what we have , even when the choice was a phantoy .
And the most of the options that we have to look , more the characteristics will come back to the constent of opportunity .
Here 's another example .
This is a lot of things .
It 's about the time , and maybe in the time , and maybe in the living lenty .
But the most important point is that you choice , you go back to them .
The things that we don 't get a tactive active , that can make less active active what we do .
And third point : The spiral growing of expectations .
I tried to my skin bought a new jeans .
I 'm going to have a jeans .
Once the jeans were just a kind of , and they were able and windows , they were discovered , just after I had a besty , and they were just to go well .
So , I went to buy a couple of the old old old , and I said , " I need a couple of jeans , this is my cut . "
The commit to me to me , " Look , and it 's a fit , and it 's fit ? "
Do you want to the cernist with the bottons ? "
" Look ? "
" Soth them ? Bla ble ? Bble bla -- " Continusted to elenhood .
I was sleep , and after a little bit , and I could say , " I want the kind of -- which was the only kind of like , " I 'm going to be , so for a little bit of time , and I 'm used to use of maleded , and then used to use jeans , and I was used to the best jeans that I had .
It was the massive . I had the whole choice .
But I feel worse .
Why ? I wrote a whole book to understand it .
The reason I was worse is that with all that choice was that with all that choice was very high , jeans had to be perfect .
I was the beginning I had expectations . I didn 't wait for the emotional , when I was a 100 different kind of , but when I was 100 different , accidents , at least a kind of had to be perfect .
What I had to buy , but it 's not perfect .
After I had to have a choice with what I was trying to be insoddly in confront of wait .
The add of options in the life of people don 't do it to be to increasing the phantoy of the same .
And this will be less soddisfation , even when the result of them are good .
Nobody in the world of marketing if it makes it .
Because if they knew , you wouldn 't know what I 'm talking about .
The truth is more to this .
" It was better when he was worse , " The reason why he was better when he was worst was worse , when he was worst was still possible to meet of surprised .
Ost , in the world we live -- opulents , industrialized citizens with the expectancy of the perspective -- we can hope is that the things are to the expectation of the expectations .
You don 't have surprised because your waiting waiting , because your waiting , my waiting , and I 'm ingigantical .
The secret of happiness -- that you 're here -- it 's : " Bave waiting " Yeah , " Yes , you want . "
I mean , small moment , I 'm really saved and my wife is really unpounds and it 's really amazing .
I couldn 't do it , I couldn 't do it .
But it 's not always a bad thing .
And finally , a consequence of buy a couple of jeans , and when there 's just that kind of jeans is that when you 're not satic , and you ask " Why ? "
" Who is responsible ? " " " , the answer is clear .
The world is the responsible . What can you do it ?
When there are hundreds of types of jeans , and you buy a insodddisfacy , and you ask is the responsible , is the responsible , is the clear that the responsible you 're you .
You could do better .
With hundreds of variety of variety of variety of variety , there are not willing for the insuccessful .
So when people take decisions , even if the result is to be able , they feel like , they feel like they 're going to be able to be sleep and they double and they double .
In the last years , the depression is explose in the industrialized world .
I think a meaning that -- not the only one , but important -- of this wave is that people have experiences of their experiences that people have experiences of them , because they 're too allowed .
And when they have to explained this situation that colps is they think that colps is .
So the final result is that in general , we 're going to be better , but we feel worse .
Let me remember .
This is the official dogma , what we 're all going to take for good and it 's completely flead . It 's not true .
There 's no doubt that a little bit of choice is better than I don 't have it , but it 's not better than a lot of choice is better than a little bit .
There 's a critical value , magic . I don 't know what it 's .
But I 'm pretty sure we 've been in a piece of the level that we 're going to be able to do our life .
Now , from the political point of the political point , I 'm almost a finished -- from the point of the political view .
What allows this choice in the industrial society is the rchemistry is the recheable material .
There are many places in the world , and you know , you know , where the problem is not that they have been paying .
The problem is that they have too .
So the way I 'm talking about is a malal , it 's a malal , the rich of the modern of modern , which is a Western society .
And what it does to depress and array is this : Steve Levitt , and he talked about how those expensive and discovered ways of these things and discovered . It 's a sprite of money .
I mean that choices , complicated and available , it 's not that they 're inuseful .
I 'm advantly in a writing .
They do it worse .
If a little bit of what in our society , although it 's reversed in those where people have too , it would not just be able to be able to be able to make , but also , it would not just be able to make it better .
This is what economists call a mixing a little bit .
A redistribution of the remodly fly , not only to the poor -- because of this choice in excess that there 's a lot of it .
For the conclude , " You can become everything you want " --
You , people , you think , " But what does that fish ? "
" It 's obvious that you can 't get anything in a bock . "
" A imagination , a limited view of the world --
and I have the interpretate I 've interpret this , in the beginning .
But then , I think , instead , I realized that that fish is that that fish is the long way .
Because the reality of fact , it 's that if you managed the bock , so that we can 't get freedom . You get the parality . You get the parality .
If you breaking the bock in a way that all divent as as as you can diminate the sodddisfation .
You get the paralysis , and you reduced the well-being .
Everybody needs a sphere .
This is almost certain too , maybe it 's even too , maybe it 's even even for us .
But the absolutely symbolic symbolic and , and I 'm a recipe for infelity and , theme .
Thank you very heart .
