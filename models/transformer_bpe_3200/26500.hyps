Last year I showed these slides to demonstrate that the ice calottartical arctica , that almost three million years had the size of 48 United States , that was about 40 percent .
But this subvaluable to gravity of the problem because it doesn 't show the ice of ice .
The arctic calculus is , in a certain sense , the heart of the global climate system .
It 's excuse and you get excuse .
The next slide will be a quick carrelated to the avimate of the last 25 years .
The ice perennia are signed in red .
You see , they expand it until the blue wall .
That 's the ice in winter , which is ritiated .
You can see that the so-called ice peradied , for five years or more , is like blood , which is the blood , which is in here was from the body .
In 25 years , it 's been on this ,
This is a problem because the heats interest the ice heats of the ice of the arctic around the ocean where there are huge amounts of fuel , which , leaves are transformed into metane from microbes .
It turns out that it 's about the totality of the atmospherical rescaling , that amount could doubt , overcome this point of not return .
In some , in Alaska , in Alaska is already rebled by water .
The professor of Alaska Katey Walter of Alaska was a team in a team in a fold lke team in a fast last winter .
Video : Wow ! AGore : You 're good . The question is if we 're going to be .
It 's a reason that this thermal exchange in the Groenland .
This is a river river in the regime .
The landed had never reached to levels like .
This is the Kangerlussuaq , in the west of Groenland .
If you want to know how the sea level of sea for the sea pace of the raferma , here is where the sea .
These current current current .
Actarctica , the largest one block of the planet .
The last month scientists have dichieve that the paper of ice is in negative , and that the Western Antartide Western , who pogilands , which pogilands on some islands .
It 's six feet to six feet of the water , like in Groenland .
Himalayas , the third third of ice , you see new ice block , and they see new laghi , which few years ago were glaciers .
40 percent of the world population recreated half of the world population .
Sulle Ande : this ice is the source of water .
The landed has increased .
But when you decrease , the same happens to the water .
In California , in California is deminuity of 40 percent .
The idricrics are in crurises .
The predictions , as you 've been reading , they 're good .
The growing ss of the world leads to a remarkable aughter .
The environmental disaster are increasing out of the normal and without precedented .
Four more numeroes in the last 30 years , than previous previous 75 .
This is a whole insustainable .
If you look in the context of the context of the context .
We 've added 70 million tons of CO2 every 24 hours -- 25 million tons of CO2 every 24 hours -- 25 million tons in the ocean every day .
Look at the Eastern Pacific area , from the American American , towards the west , and on both parts of the Indian substitor , where there 's a radical rootal deep in the ocean .
The most of the global warming , together to deforestation , which is 20 percent of them , is the fossil fuel use .
The oil is a problem , and the fuon is even worse .
The United States is one of two more emissions , together to China .
And it was proposed to build many other carbon center .
But we 're seeing a direction of a direction .
These are the anullated projects over the last few years and some green proposes of green alternative .
Everyway , there 's a political load in our country .
The carbon industry and oil have spent 250 million dollars in the last year to promote carbon , which is a oxymous .
I was something that I 'd remember something --
Verice , in Tennessee , where I saw , there was a loss of 3.8 billion gallons of carbon .
You may have seen it on news .
This is the second largest flow of last flow in America .
It 's happened around Natal .
The puzzle of one of the carbon industry was this .
Video : : Still the carbon is a kind of allegro and happy .
It 's abundant here in America , and it grow our economy .
Froy the carbon . It 's more and smaller .
It 's good price , adorable and working work , they keep the argue .
Al Gore : At here 's a lot of the West Virginia .
The largest mineral society on the mountains is Massey Coal . This is his administrator .
Video : Don Blankenship : I 'll be clear -- Al Gore , Nancy Pelious , Harry Reid -- -- -- they don 't know what they 're talking about .
Al Gore : So the Alleance for Protext Clima has launched two campaign .
This is one of them , one part .
Video : Acy COALergy : ALergy , we see climate change as a sery in our business .
So , our priority is to invest a big amount of money in a publishing , to make public and confused the truth of the carbon .
In fact , carbon is not sports .
We think it 's clean -- it 's also a good profuse .
So , not pavocupaign change .
Let me do it .
Video : Carbone : Carbone -- you 've heard a lot of speaking .
So , let 's take a turn into a horderly into a horric structure for the pulit .
Straordinary ! The machines are a little rumor , but this is the sound of the fuel technology of coal .
The carbon consumption is between the main core core crucial technology , but the remarkable technology of the clean that you see changes everything .
You look at a look : this is the odiern technology of clean .
Al Gore : Inally , the positive alternative positive consequence and the national security .
Video : Comment : The America is in crisis , economy , the national security ,
The river that connects all : our dependence from fossil fuel fuel , like the sports of fossil fuel ,
Now , but there 's a new , audace , there 's a new , audace .
Repower : 100 percent of energy , in 10 years .
A to re-scale plan America to work , make sure more surance , and help stop the global warming .
Finally , a solution that is babs to solve our problems .
Repower . Scoprice more .
Al Gore : This is the last .
Video : It 's about report energy to America .
One of the fastest ways to bring to dependence dependence of combustible that killing our planet .
Compars : The future is here . Vent , a new energy network .
Compars number two : Negi investment for very well .
Comment : Repower America . It 's time to be realists .
Al Gore : A old proverbio is , " If you want to go fast , you go to fast it , you go to fast .
If you want to go back . "
We have to go away , fast .
Thank you very much .
Last year at TED , I introducing to the LHC .
And I promise to return to enjoyring about how the machine works .
So I 'm here . And for those who were not , the LHC is the largest scientific experiment ever , in the LHC is the largest scientific experiment ever ,
Her tone of them is to reconstructions that were present less than a billion billion ardesimum of the universe -- to 600 million times a second .
All that 's just ambiitious .
This is the machine in Ginevra .
We 're doing this min-Big Bang in the remarkers .
This is what I work . It 's called ATLAS -- it 's large-foot diameter .
This is a picture of ATLAS picture in building so you can see proportions .
Ten , 10 to the september of last year , we acceso the machine .
And this picture was taken by ATLAS .
It was because of immense festeggams in control .
It 's a picture of the first fascinating fascinating around the LHC , entering in collision , entering in collision , with a part of the LHC , and spread particles into the relevant .
In other words , when we see that picture 10 september , we realize that the machine worked , which is a great writing .
I don 't know if it was this to exultar us more or this , when somebody went on on on Google and saw the page was this .
That means we 've had a cultural impact beyond to the scientific impact .
About a week after , there was a problem with the machine , just to these file files here -- these files .
These files are 13,000 amping when the machine works at the massive of power .
Now , the technicians of you will look at the physics and say , " It 's not true . I 'm so suck . "
And they can do it because when they 're very freezing cosi-called super-files .
So , at least 271 degrees , at least 271 degrees in the space between stars , these files can bring that current .
In one of the juntures of the most novemile magneti in the LHC , there was a defect of fabrication .
So the file rescaled it , and the 13,000 practice suddenly met a electrical resilience .
This was the result .
Now , this is even more impressive if you think that these magneti fish fish more than 20 tons , and that have been moved about 30 centimeters .
They 're sitting at about 50 magnets .
We had to take them , what we did .
We 've represent them and enables .
Now they 're going back all on their place place place place .
I finally track of march the LHC will be again .
We 're going to access it , and we expect to get data to the June , and we keep that our adventure to find out what are the morning is the universe .
Now , of course , in a certain way , these accidents are accending the debate of science and engineering in front of science and engineering in front of science and engineering in front of the engineering . It 's easy to conflict .
I think the fact that it 's so hard , the fact that it 's the value of things like LHC .
I 'd like to conclude with the words of a English scientist , Humphrey , which , I imagine , in defense of inuseful experiments of his pupille , his pupille was Michael Faday , he said , " Nient is so much dangerous for the progress of human mind how ring that our report of the human mind that we have been conqueen ,
Thank you .
I want to start asking you about rethink of when you 're , you played with children , played by the morning .
While you can get them and say , you can get them and get them , and you 're going to be able to think and solve problems , and actually , and you know , and in space and manipulating relationships .
The space reasoning is deeply connected to the way we understand most of the world around us .
So , from information usulaughed by the usulaugh of our interaction with physical objects , together to my Paint , and my collaborator Jeevan Kalanithi , I started asking myself , " And when we use a computer , instead of having the only of the cursor that moves on a desktop , we could trust in a very much science physically confidence a science , we could actually trust an information with both hands ,
and how do it as our please ?
The question was so interesting that we decided to explore the answer , building Siftable .
In a few words , a Siftable computer interactive as a biscoothing .
In a few words , a Siftable computer interactive as a biscoothing .
You can move with them , they can , " to see " between them , " and they 're going to hear their movement and they have a screen and a wireless .
But most absolutely , are physicists , like the morning , you can actually move it .
The Siftable is an example of a new tools of tools to manipulate digital information .
And as they become more physicists , achieve the movement , of others , and as they become more physicists , consciousness of their movement , of other people , we can explore new things , we can explore new new and funny them .
I 'll start with some simple example .
This Siftable is configured to show video : if you 're cut it into a direction , the video will rotate this , it will rotate it .
These interactive rats are aware of of other .
If I affiants them , they 're interested in what they 're going to .
If they come around , they can see it and they can act a little bit .
If they come around , they can see it and they can act a little bit .
They also great-great-like and inclination .
We then realized that one of the interesting implications of the interaction was to be able to use communicate for example , " a color like it was a liquid .
In this case , we have three Siftable as a buck-cut bucks and I can use them to the central color , where they mix .
and I can use them to do for the color in that central , where they mix .
We can get too much , we can put a little bit in there .
I 'm also good possibilities of apprenticing , like language , mathematics and logic games where people can try things fast , and see the results are immediately .
I 'm --
This is a Fibonactic sequence I do with a equations program .
Here we have a words that 's half between Scarabeo and Boble .
Pratically , at every turn-rich literally , at every Siftable , Pratically , at every turning to a literate in case on every Siftable , and while you 're trying to buy them .
Then , after about 30 seconds they put it , and you have a new lettle set of reading and new possibilities to try .
Thank you .
Here 's the children came to the Media Lab , I did a way that I triassed them and I turned a video .
They 're very liked .
And one of the interesting things like this kind of appliation is that you don 't have to give people a lot of instructions .
You just say , " Compons of words , and they know exactly what to do .
Here 's what other people do .
This is our younger tester tester , there on the right .
It was actually wanted to impilate them .
They 're only morning morning , for him .
Now , this is an application of a interactive cardboard .
We wanted to build a tool for the apprentice of language is Felix .
It can insert new characters in the scene , lipping the Siftable .
It can insert new characters in the scene , lipping the Siftable .
So , it 's doing the sun .
Video : The sun is smile .
David Merrill : Now it has taken a tretor in the scene .
Video : The trewer arange .
Bel work ! Yeah !
So , by schooling the Siftable and can get close to interact with characters --
Video : Bau !
-- by inventing their story .
Video : Hi !
DM : It 's a story with the opened , and it can decide him like .
DM : It 's a story with the opened , and it can decide him like .
Video : From .
DM : The last example I have time to show you is a tool , which is a instrument , to campioneer and execececececting music .
it 's a tool , made of recent , to trampioning and execececececture .
The Siftable here are act like bass , based on the bass and battery .
Each of these has four different variations , and you can choose what to use .
You can also insert these sounds in a sequence to bet your please .
And it just just by doing it touch a " sound " and a sequence . "
These are actually you can control from the vial , like the reverber and the filter .
The attacks to a particular sound and then cut for them .
And then there are the general effects like and volumes , that they applied in the sequence .
Let 's look at how it works .
Video : We 're going to start with a two-Siftable , " sequence , " We can put them in a series , we put it in a series , we add more basic .
Now I 'll put a bass line .
Video : DM : I adding the percussions --
Video : And I 'll put the filter to bacteria , so I can control the effect of the face .
Video : I can be able to be able to enable sequence the entire sequence of time from one side .
Video : I 'll add the bottom of the bottom of the expression filter to give more expression .
Video : I can recombine the sequence of the sequence .
So I don 't have to planning it before , but I can improvisate , make it longer or .
And now , finally , I can spend the whole sequence on the left is " volume . "
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is to build new new mo-machine interfacial machine that we have all the time in our brain and body .
And today , I 've had time to show you one of the results of this path , and even some chance we try to bring out of the lab .
The concept I want to transit you is that it 's coming to this new generation of designed objects to interact with digital media , that will bring information in our world in the way we want .
Thank you very much .
I don 't see the time I 'm talking to all of you .
I 'm a writer .
I 'm going to claw is my profession , but it 's more than that , of course .
It 's also love and the fashion of my life .
And I don 't expect that it can change .
But , I said , something particularly happened in my life and career , which has led me to recently , that I took me to report with this work .
The particular thing is that I recently written this book , this biography called " Mangia , " The Ama , " which , diversally from my previous books , in my own own own , and it became a great , bestseller , international ,
And the result is that everywhere is now , people treat me as if I were convicted .
It 's true -- convicted , convicted !
They 're all right now worried and they say , " Do you don 't have to do better ?
Do you don 't have it fear to write for all life , not to be able to create a book that can care that it can be to make somebody ? "
that can be for somebody ? "
It 's rassured , you know .
But it may go worse , part of the one I remember that over 20 years ago , when I started to say , I was a adolescent -- I wanted to be a writing .
I 'd put it up to the same reaction based on the fear .
And people said , " Don 't I could not have success to be successful ?
Do you don 't have you fear that the umillion you are killed ?
Do you don 't have this mestify for all of life , not going to be out and die on a cumulation of dreams with the cuts of lower dreams with failure ? "
so , you know .
The answer -- the short answer to all these questions is , " Yes . "
Yes , I 'm fear of all those things .
I 've always had fear .
And I also have many other things that people can 't have to be inguess .
As the algae and other things .
But , as I write what I thought and I 'd ask myself and I said , very much , what is why ?
Is it rational ?
It 's logical that anyone who has to wait to be spended by a job that 's been born to do .
But what 's so particularly in the impress that we have to nervous mental health of the other people in a way that other careers don 't do ?
How father , for example , he was a chemist engineer and I don 't remember one time in its 40 years of activity that they were asked if he was doing it for for hold to be able ?
There was never -- that was that block of John , what does it go ?
It didn 't work that , you know ?
Onestly , chemical engineers like group have not certainly , in the centuries , warning the reputation of being alcococoils .
We 've been writers , we have enough this reputation , and not just writers , but creative of every kind , we have this reputation of them to be enormous .
And it 's not anything else that you look at the trial deaths of magnify creative mines that , only in the 21st century , they die young and often .
And even those who are not suicians seem to be really disfaced by their dunes .
Norman Mailer , before he died , in the last interview , he said , " Every book , I 've killed a little more " an extraordinary affercise to work .
But we don 't get it up when we heard these things so long that we 've been completely interiorized and accepted the notion that 's all been interiorized and accepted the notion that creativity and suffering are in some way of reading , and that art , it will always always always the angoscious .
And the question I want to take all of today is : are you agree with this idea ?
I 'll tell you this thing -- because it 's also a hundred of a hundred distance to me , it doesn 't know this support .
I think it 's hate .
And I think it 's dangerous and I don 't want to see perpetuated it in the next century .
I think it 's better encouraging our creative minds to live .
And I certainly know that , in my case -- in my situation -- it would be very dangerous to start fuse that I was very dangerous untable to start the circumstances that are in my career .
It 's pretty much -- you look at it , they 're pretty young , I have about 40 years .
I still have about four work decades .
And it 's very likely that I write in now , it will be right from the world like the work that came out after the world like the work that was going to use it as successed as as a success of my last book .
I 'm going to be slave , because we are all more or less friends here -- it 's likely that my big success is my own own .
Oh , Gesus , who thought !
You know this is the kind of thought that leads a person to start to start to bet in the morning of the morning and I don 't want to do it .
I 'll keep doing this work that we work .
So , the question becomes , how ?
And so I think , after many reflective , that the way to work to continue to write is to create a psychological construct , OK ?
I have to find a sense of security in me , I 'm writing , I 'm writing , and my natural anxial , which reaction is going to write it . And while I was trying to do it in time , trying to find other society to see if they could have some better ideas and more sane and more sane societies to see if they could have some better ideas and more sane and better healthy and sane .
how to help people creative response people to manage creative risks .
And that research has taken me to the ancient Grek and ancient Rome .
Heem , I 'm going to go back .
In the ancient Grek and ancient Rome -- people didn 't seem to believe that creativity were in men , OK ?
And it was thinking that creativity was this spirit , and that they were in the men from some distant distant and unknown , for distant distant reasons , for distant distant reasons .
The Great were called these spirites were called the CEEEEEEEEEEEExcy .
Socrate , wonderful , believed to have a helarge that 's wisdom wisdom ,
The Rooms were the idea , but they called the " spirit species . "
which is great , because Rooms didn 't really think that a genius were people who didn 't think a genius were particularly intelligent .
They believe that a genius was this kind of divine that had been living in the walls of an artist 's study , a little bit like the elphotos of an artist , and that came out of the result of the artist work of hidden and models the result of artist and models the result of the artist work .
Excemotional -- that 's the distance of which I talk about -- that psychological construct that you protects you from the results of your work .
And they all knew that it was so that it worked , right ?
So the anti-artists were protected by certain things , like , for example , too much narcisysm , right ?
If your work was exceptional , you couldn 't get all the result , all of you know that you 've been helped by this incorporeous genius .
If your work failed , it wasn 't your whole , you know , right ?
Everybody knew that it was your genius to be an inable .
And so people are conceived in the creativity in Occide for a long time .
And then the Renagement came and everything changed , and it was born , and it 's this great idea ; we put the human being over the center of the universe above all and mysters and without leave space of creatures that they write from divinity .
This was the principle of human rational and people started thinking that creativity came completely from the isse .
And for the first time in history , they started to refly this or artist as a genius , like a genius rather than a genius with genius .
And I have to say , I think it was a big mistake .
I think I allow somebody , a simple person to believe that it 's like a recipient source , the essence and the source of all the mysters , creatives , unknown as a recibility , creatives , unknowable and eth-like responsibility .
It 's like to ask someone to enjoy the sun .
Deform and demand , completely the ego and creates all these ingestishes expected to performance .
And I think it was this pressure pressure that they 've been destroyed in 500 years .
And , if this is true , and I think it 's , the question becomes , and now ?
Can we do it diversity ?
Maybe come back to a more old comprement of the relationship between human and creative mystery .
Or maybe not .
Maybe we can 't sing 500 years of rational thinking in a talk of 18 minutes .
And there 's probably people in the audience that would have been reading sospects on the notion of , you know , they 're doing that people are doing so they follow in people by spend of doing their projects .
I 'm not going to convince you all about this .
But the question I 'd like to ask is -- why not ?
Why would you not think that way ?
Because it has more sense of everything that has ever heard for explaining the experant imprevebility of the creative process .
One process that , as anyone who ever tried to do something -- so , basically , all here -- you don 't compete .
And , in fact , it can sometimes sometimes it can be completely paranormal .
I did this meeting recently with the extraordinary poetry Stone , who has 90 years , but that was a poetry for all life and told me that during her childhood in the rural Virginia , working out in the camps , and he felt it , in if a poem came from the landscape .
He told me that was like a frageous train .
And that was rotolling to her from the landscape .
He felt it , because he was going to be able to tremare under his feet .
He knew I had one thing to do to do at that point and was of words , " running like a mater . "
And so it 's going to correct home and came from this poetry , and it didn 't have to get a piece of paper and a mature pretty quickly as the traph , and it was pretty quickly in the page .
Sometimes I couldn 't be fast enough , so it 's and it 's going to hold and correcrect and he had no way to get in home and the rotolar , and she would continue to rotolar through the landscape , trying , as she said , " another poet . "
Then there were those times -- this piece of time I 'm going to never forget it -- there were moments where she was almost losing , OK ?
So , he was running home and she was trying to try and card her through , and she was a married right in the time that was going , and then said , that it was like if you go on , and then he said , that was like if you go on and the steffee .
He was going to cause the poem from the coda and put it in its body and transcscreen on the page .
And in these cases , the poem would be presented on the perfect page and intact but the contrary , from the last word to the first .
So when I felt that I thought -- it 's very exceedative , it 's exactly the same process .
Not all my creative process -- I 'm not a convict !
I 'm a mulo , and my way to work is ; I 'm wake up , and I 'm going to play and go through the goffly .
But even I , in my testing aggin my testy-board , I 've been striped against that , sometimes .
And I guess that even many of you do the han made .
You know , even though the work and ideas came to me from a certain source , I could not honestly sake it .
And what is this thing ?
And how can we relate it to it in a way that we don 't lose your head , but rather , that makes us remains ?
As I 'm about , the best contemporary example I have is the musicist Tom Waits , which I interviewed different years ago for a newspaper .
We were talking about this , and you know , Tom , for the majority of life was the incarnation of the artist tomented recently , trying to control , deal , to deal these species of impulses .
But then I invite , he cut down , and one day while she was driving on a highway in Los Angeles , he changed everything for him .
He was going to be fast and everything with this little framework framment , which comes in his head as inspiration , and it comes in his head as inspiration , and it wants , and it wants , and it wants , you know , it 's wonderful , and it doesn 't know how you .
It doesn 't have a piece of paper , it doesn 't have a mature .
So I started to feel this kind of old anxioned , " I 'm going to lose , " I 'm going to lose , and I 'll hold it .
I 'm not good enough and I can 't do it . "
And instead of going to stopped ,
He got the whole mental process and made something completely new .
And I just just the sky and said , " Scause , I 'm not driving ? "
" Do you think it can write a song now ? "
If you really want to be there , it 's a more opporter , when I can take care of you .
Or , I go to importantly somebody else today .
I went to disturbing Leonard Cohen . "
And his process changed after this .
Not work , the work , it was still dark .
But the process , and the heavy anxiety was releft when he took her and genius , the genius that was going out of him for him , and he was going back from it back to where was , making it .
but it 's not Tom , this wonderful , beautiful , thank you collaboration between Tom and this strange and outside that it was not Tom .
So , as I felt that story started to change a little bit even the way I worked and already save me once .
This idea , I 'm going to save me when I was writing , " Mangia , " Ama , " and cadds in one of those cause we all work on something and we can 't do when we 're working on something and we can 't start thinking that it will be a disaster , which is going to be the worst book book .
Not just bad , just the worst book written .
And I started thinking about this project .
But I reminded me of Tom I talked about the air and I tried it .
So I went up my face on the grip and I was made my common to a vacuum of the room .
And I said , " Hise , what , both of you know , what , you know , both of you know that if this book is not going to be smart for my , no ?
Because as I 'm going to see I 'm putting everything I have , I don 't have this .
So if you want it to be better , you have to presently you have to do your side .
OK . But if you don 't do it , you know what , I don 't do anything .
I 'm going to write the same because it 's my work .
And I want to do that that was recorded I presented today to me to do my part , " Because -- finally , it 's so , OK -- it 's so , OK -- -- that 's in North Africa 's people were all unring for dance to the bunch of the moon , and music that went on and go to stuff and up to stuff it all the stuff .
And they were always magnify , because the ballerins were great .
But every so , rarely , something happened , and one of these artists had become transformer .
And I know what I know , because I know you 've all seen , at some point , a performance like that .
It was like the time , and the dance , and the dance walked through a kind of land-up and not doing anything different from the usual , like 1,000 night , but all it was all all all disrupon .
And sudden , it doesn 't look just like a human .
But he 's accese from the divinity of divinity .
And when this happened , in the temples , people knew what was , they were called him .
They had their hands and started to start sing , " Allah , Allah , Allah , God , God God , " God , God , " God , "
That 's God , you know .
Curious note -- when Morinvaded the south of Spain , I was this habitude with them and their previous , and they 'll change in the center of " Allah , " in the south , " Ale , " , " the two , " the gun , " two , " the corries , " , " the south , "
In Spain , when an artist did something impossible and magical , " Allah , the At , Apole , I was good , I good , I 'm good , " incomprehed , it -- a last of God .
And it 's great because we need .
But , the problem comes on the day after , for the dance , when you wake up and discover that are the 11 morning of Marteeth , and that last of God 's morning and God .
It 's just a mortal with gran bad , and maybe it 's not going to get that height .
And maybe nobody will have the name of God still in the name of her life .
It 's hard .
This is one of the most paorous recogniliations to do in creative life .
But maybe it doesn 't have to be so angotten if you can 't believe , mostly , that the most extraordinary aspects of your being from you .
But you might just believe that they 're being being being as a inimaginable data of this team that you have to go through somebody else that you have to go to somebody else when you finished .
And , you know , if we think it all changes .
And so I started thinking about it , and it 's certainly how I thought about a lot of months during the working of the book that I 'll be doing soon , the dangerous , attesissum , attesissum followed my my great success .
And what I have to continue to tell me when I feel elected by this is , it 's not not fear .
Not just break . It 's just your work .
It 's a present-minute presentation for your side , any can be .
If your work is dance , bank .
If the divine , absurd on you assigned to you , just just a few kinds of wonderful , for one moment through your effort , so , " Ole ! "
Or , you do the same thing your dance .
And " Ole ! " You know the same .
I think and I should teach it .
" You know , " at you , even only for having human love and testicy tack-tical aggin that you 're going to be able to present you .
Thank you .
Thank you .
June Cohen : Ole !
And as you know I 've talked about some of these projects on the human genome , what can mean and discovery new new new new set of genes .
Now we 're starting a new path : we started to digitize biology and now now starting to digital code are both in a new biology , design and design and synthize life .
We 've always been trying to bring big questions .
" What is life ? " It 's something that many biologists have tried to understand vareas .
We tried different approaches , reduced it to the minimum terms .
We 're digitizing for almost 20 years .
When we sequenced the human genome was to spend from the analome of biology in the digital world .
Now we ask us : can regenerate life , or new life from this digital universe ?
This is the map of a small organism , Mycoplasma genitalium , which is the species from the smallest genome of the smallest genome of lab .
And we tried to reduce more than the genome to create a little bit more .
We 're able to eliminate a hundred genes of about 500 genes that are here .
But when we go to the metabolic map , it 's relatively simple than our .
I believe me , this is simple .
But when we look at all the genes that we can eliminate , one at the time , it 's very unlikely that this can bring to a living cell .
So we decided that the only way to progree was synthesize this chromosome of these funding so that they can get the components to bring some of these fundamental questions .
And so we started the adventure of " Can . Can we synthesize a chromosome ? "
Can you have to try to produce these big molecules that we never had to create these big molecules that we never had to create before ?
And , in case , can we make a chromosome ?
A chromosome is just a piece of chemical material .
The speed that we 're able to digitize life is growing to recil life is growing to reponential .
Our ability to write the genetic code , instead , progree rather slowly , but it 's improving .
And our most recent results have to a exponential curve .
We started over 15 years ago .
The process has require many passages , starting with a bioethical review before we started the first experiments .
But we found that synthize DNA is very difficult .
There are tens of thousands of machines in the world that make small DNA segments of DNA , long 50 letters , and it 's a degenerative process : the longer the segment is , more mistakes there are .
So we had to develop a new way to assembly these framments and correct the mistakes .
And this was our first attempt , to party digital genome , and that 's the 1974 .
It 's a small virus that kills bacteria .
We designed the fragments , effectively , actually , and I got a molecule of DNA , about 5,000 letters .
The interesting part is when we got this piece of inert chemical material , inert material in bacteria , bacteria have started reading this genetic code and to produring viral particles .
The viral particles have been released by cells , they went back and they 've been back and they deroround the E.
I talked to recent with the oil industry by saying , they 're certainly compresive that they have to do this model .
They 've been rice rice to .
We believe this is a situation where software can actually build its own hardware in a biological system .
But we wanted to do things bigger .
We wanted to build the whole chromosome of bacteria .
They 're over 580 thousand thousand letters of genetic code .
So we thought of building it in the size of viruses , so that we can change the cassette for us to understand the cassets of a living cell .
The design is crucial , and if we start with digital information in a computer , these must be very accurate .
When we sequenced this genome for the first time in 1995 accurattainty was a mistake for every 10 mile mile .
We found out , resequence , 30 mistakes . If we had that original sequence would never be able to work .
One part of the process is designing 50 letters that are under-like , 50 letters that are overlap with all the other 50 letters to build underneath .
We try the only elements here .
You probably read that we 're going to read that we put in the filiguring .
Think that we have a genetic code on four letters : A , C , G and T.
Three of those letters are going to put together about 20 frighly amminoid , and there 's a specific order of reading for every friend .
So we can use the genetic code for write words , frases , thoughts .
What we did in the beginning was autograpraped to do it .
Some have been dolusers from the fact that it wasn 't poem .
We designed these segments for potherly united to only only only join enzymes .
There are them that they repair them and put them on them .
And we started assembly in the parts , starting with five to seven mile seven mile , and unended them up to a segments of 24 thousands of 24 thousands of lettes .
Everything we 've made these segments in abunance so that we can sequence that we 're trying to create an extremely robbystobey-stopile processing -- as you 're going to see in a minute .
We 're trying to author the process .
So , this seems like a basket of a basket player .
When we get these very long , much more than 100 miles , the more than 100 mile , they are not going to grow it in the E.
It 's the limit of modern biology tools .
So we 've been considered other mechanisms .
We knew about another mechanism called the omologa , called the omologa , that in biology is to repair the DNA to work to work .
Here 's an example .
This organism , called Deinococell , can absorbs three million radiodurans .
You can see in the superior of the chromosome like this chromosome .
In 12 -- 24 hours , it 's reassembled exactly how it was before .
They 're able to do it .
These organisms can sit completely .
They can live under vacuum .
They 're absolutely that life exist in space , and you have places to find new riches of water .
ASA showed it that this is .
This is a picture of the molecule that we built using these processes , just using the light-to-design , just using the segments .
The lights assemble them .
This picture was not taken with a micle microscope , but with a microscope , but with a microscope .
It 's a molecule that we can see it with a slide microscope .
These are pictures that they 're doing a period of about six seconds .
This is the publishing that we did a little time ago .
They 're over 580,000 letters of genetic code .
It 's the largest molecule of a defined structure .
It 's got a 300 molecular molecular weight .
If we 're going to pen it with a 10 without spaces , they would like 142 pages only to transcend this genetic genetic code .
Now , how do we do it work ? How can we activate it ?
Of course , a virus is a game game game .
It 's a little bit more complicated when they use bacteria .
It 's simpler cells , even when it 's about eucariote cell , you can just extract the nucleus and put another , which is basically the process of clonation .
In the archaaea bacteria , it 's instead of integrated in the cell , but we 've been able to do a complete trapipe of a chromosome from one cell to another and active it .
We clean a chromosome from a microbial species .
The two are different as men from the mouse .
We 've added some gene gene in more way to decide what this chromosome .
The skip with the enzymes , so I can kill all the proteins .
And when we put it in the cell was astern -- and you 're going to appreciate our sopher graphic graphic graphic graphic -- -- the new chromosome .
And we started thinking that we couldn 't go beyond , but we tried to push us in there .
This is one of the major mechanisms .
We found that a second , and we 've added a second or a crumosome , in a second , in a second thousand new traits species .
So who think about evolution as only gene has no matter that it didn 't understand much much much of biology .
They are the enzyme called restriation enzyme , they 're going to have the DNA .
The chromosome that was in the cell doesn 't have one .
The cell phone , the chromosome that we put it .
It 's expressed , and it recognized the other express as expressed material , has masticated it , and we 've been rured with only the cell and the new chromosoma .
It became blue because of the genes we 've put .
And in a short time , all the characteristics of a species are gone . And it has been loved , and it turned around around around in a new species , based on new software that we 've insered in the cell .
All the proteins have changed , the membrane have changed , and when we read the genetic code , exactly what we 've transferted the genetic code .
Now , this may seem to genetic altering , but altering the DNA software , we can change things quite substantial .
Now , I 've already explained that this is not talking about genesis -- but it 's starting by three million years of evolution , and I said that maybe we 're probably going to create a new version of Cambrian explosion where we 're going to create new species on this digital .
Why do that ?
I think it 's pretty obvious when we think about our necessity .
We 're going to go from six and a half billion people in the next 40 years .
Just to give an example : I was born in 1946 .
Now there are three people on the planet for each existing in 1946 , in 40 years , there will be four .
We 're having problems now to find food , fresh water and breed , medicinal water and wealth for six billion and a half of people .
It will be even more hard for it .
We use more than five billion carbon , more than 30 billion carbon , more than 30 billion baris .
That means a hundred million baries a day .
When we try to find biological processes , or any kind of process to replace them , it will be a huge challenge .
We have to keep the whole whole hemisplayer of CO2 . These materials that are going to end in the atmosphere .
At day , thank you for the scientific discoveries all around the world , we have a database with about 20 million genes , and I like to think they are the design components for the future .
The electronics industry possible only one dozen about components , and think about how many different things are coming out .
Our limitations are principles of biological reality and our imagination .
Now we have techniques , because of these rapid synthesization , able to create what we call combinatory .
We 're able to build a big robot that can produce a million chromosomes per day .
Think of processing these 20 million genes or different genes of trying to optimize the processes to produce eightt-, new vaccines , new vaccines , and we can change , because of a small team , and create more biology now that over the last 20 years .
And it 's just a standard selection .
We can choose for survival , chemical production or fuel production , or fuel production of vaccine .
This is an instantaneous instantanea of software software programs that we 're working for being able to seat-tached species to computers .
Well , we don 't know how it will will be .
We know exactly how it 's the genetic code .
We 're now four-generation fuel .
You 've seen that you 've also extract that you have to extract .
We have a second and third generation generation that are going to be done enough sugar of sugar , as much as the eight-value , like the eight-different kinds of butanol .
But the only way that biology can have a big impact without increasing the cost of food and limitarne the cost of food and limitary to transforming the cost of food and limitary . It 's first , so we 're working to design cells that can achieve this . And we can have the first fuels that are going to be able to have the first fuels in about 18 months .
The solar light light with the CO2 is a metodo-- but our discovery different things around the world , we found different metods .
This is a organism that we described in 1996 .
It 's about 2-500 feet deep , at about 2,500 feet deep at at the temperature of water .
They create metane from CO2 using molecular hydrogen molecular energy .
We 're trying to figure out if we can incanalate CO2 , that can easily be transported through , to convert that CO2 carbon , to drive this process .
So , very short , we can be able to increasing what the basic question of " which is life " We , " What 's life " We , " greatest , " -- we have the goal of the whole oil industry .
Exactly . If you can 't do that from TED , where can you ?
It would be a main of energy source .
And we 're working for using the same metods to create instantaneous instantanes .
You 've seen this year with influence , we always go back and a year and with a dollar , when it 's about find the right vaccine .
I think what you can change combinable vaccines in table .
That 's how the future could start seem to change , now , the evolution tree , accelerating evolution with bacteria , arches , arches , arches , and finally inally cell .
We are so much about the improving people .
Our purpose is to do that long enough to live long enough to try to do it . Thank you very much .
First of all I 'm going to show you , the most rapidly possible , some fundamental work , the new technology that we 've taken to Microsoft , following a year ago . This is Seadragon .
It 's a environment where you can interact with a huge amount of visions of the local data .
So , we 're seeing very many gigabyte photos of digital photograph with a kind of zoom and continuous , for a spanoramic fast , and avoes that we are .
And it doesn 't matter how big the amount of information that we see , how big these are these collecting data or images .
Most are common photographs , but this for example is a scanning from the Library of the Library of Congress , and reenter in the gamp of 300 megapiel .
It doesn 't make any difference because the only thing that limits of the prestations of a system like this is the number of pixel on your screen in your screen in any time . It 's also very flexible architecture .
This is a book , for example of data not images .
This is the Dickens . Every colonna represents a caple .
So to show you that it 's just about it and not images , we can do something like this , to actually actually make a real representation of the text , not a picture .
It could be a little artificial way to read an electronic book .
I don 't know it .
This is a matheest example . It 's a number of the Lardian .
Every picture is the beginning of a section .
And it really gives you the pleasure and the becomes to read the real paper version of a magazine , which is for nature of a quocian , which is for nature .
We also did something with the angle of this number in particular of the Lardian .
We 've created a higher advertising ads -- much higher than the one that you use in a normal advertising -- and we put it in the extra content .
If you want to see the characteristics of this automobile , you can see here .
Or other models , or even the specific techniques .
And this really shows some of these ideas to eliminate the limits of space on the screen .
We hope that this means to put it in the end of a few other porcheries , and others , you don 't have to be necessarily .
Of course , the map is one of the most obvious applications for this kind of technology .
And I don 't want to lose time , if we don 't have any time , in fact , to give them in this field .
These are all the streets in the U.S. sover-sound picture of NASA .
So now we go to something else .
This is actually the way I live on the web ; you can go to see it .
It 's a project called Photosynthtosynthosynthy , which combines two different technologies .
One is Seadragon and the other is a very interesting visual computer , in the other interesting , by Noah Snavely , a student of the University of Washington , with Steve Seitz of UW Seitz Rick Szeliski Research . At a cool collaboration .
And it 's from the Weadragon .
You can see that when we do this kind of screen , where we can go from one image to the other and have this kind of experience to get this kind of experience .
But the space collocation of pictures has actually a meaning .
The algorithms of computers have been recorded these pictures together , so that they have been on the re-places where they 've got these picked up . All right to the skepts on Montagne Roccies -- they 've been scaten . Here you see the elements of a slightly show or panaoric images , and these things were all connected to the level .
I don 't know if I have time to show you some other environment .
There are some more space .
I want to go directly to one of Noah-- and this is from a previous privious prototype of Photosynthtosynthtosynthtosynthoahsynth-tosynthesus , technology technology Photosynthtosynthosynth-tosyntheses . And it 's not necessarily obviously observing that we put in website .
We had to do what legal things and on .
This is a re-building of Notre Dame pictures press from Flickr , Dame digiteral . Basta digites Notre Dame and get pictures of types in magic field , and you get pictures of these orange areas . Each one of these orange areas .
So they 're all images of Flickr and they 're all connected to space like this .
And it 's possible to navigate this very simple way .
You know , I never thought I 'd be going to end to work for Microsoft .
It 's very gratifiction to get this kind of accovery here .
I think you can see that it 's a lot of different types of photos : from those of cell phone . SLR , a meaning number meaningful , put together in this environment .
And if I can , I try to try to look at those strange .
Many of them are cut up , etc .
Sowhere there 's a series of photographs -- it 's a series of photographs -- it .
This is a poster of Notre Dame recorded correctly .
We can go from the poster to the physics of this environment .
The essential point is that we can do things with social environment . This is now taking data from the whole memory of collective memory of how it looks like the Earth , from the sides of view -- and connections all those data together .
All those pictures become connected together , bigger of the sum of the parts .
You have a whole land model .
Think about this as prolungment of Stephen Lawler 's work on Earth .
It 's something that grows in complexity as people are using it , and which advantages for people who are using it .
Their pictures are marcut with inseries of other people .
If you get the idea of contrassigning all these sorts of sorts of knowledge , my picture of Notre Dame suddenly recognize all those data , and I can use how much of those data , and I can use how much much you have a cross-to-ring experience , and cross-to-rich experience of cross-modes and cross-user experience of cross-moes and cross-user .
Of course , a consequence of all of this are virtual models of every interesting part of the Earth , it doesn 't just hold it , you know , and from satellite images , but from the collective memory .
Thank you .
Chris Anderson : I realized ? What your software is that your software software is that you 're going to have to do is that at some point , in the next few years , all of these are going to be practice together ?
BAA : Yes . What 's doing is doing is basically to find out .
It 's creating hyperlinks , if you want , you want to be .
And it 's doing it in the base of images .
The thing is it very interesting if you think about wealth of semantes of information semantes that many of these images are .
As a searching for images , you 're digit , you have a phrase and the text on the web page has a lot of information about images .
Now , what if that picture does all your pictures ?
So the amount of semantical interconnection and the amount of wealth that 's really enormous . It 's a classic effect of the network .
CA : Blaise , it 's really incredible . Compliments .
BAA : I thank you very much .
One of the main pleasure , when you go through and one of the ethnographics of eth-and-a-and-a-and-a-and-a-and-a-and-a-to-flying .
Baster : I think the sciamans Jaguar vision still beyond the Via Lattea , or that the people are still in Himalayas , or Himalayas , or Himalayas , they 've got followed the respire of Dharma , but it 's just a model , to remind the central importance of ances , and that the idea that the world we live in it not exior supply , but it 's just a model ,
the consequence of a particular adaptative choices that our stones did , well , many generations ago .
And , of course , we all share the essential tracs .
We all all procreating . We all procreating .
We are subjects in the initiation .
We have to death the inexecorability of death , so we don 't surprising and whom we whom we whom we 're going to whom out .
We all have an art .
What it does is the rhythm of song , the rhythm rhythm of every culture .
It doesn 't matter that they 're the same same as the Rouought of Borneo , or the following Vodoo 's the Cursut , or the desert of Kenya , Kenya , and the Curandero of Ande , or a cammell-called the heart of Sahara .
He was my journey in desert a month ago , or a yak of yak in the Yet , in the Everest , on Everest , the Everest , the Everest , the mother of the world .
All these people are teaching us that are other ways of there are other ways of thinking , other ways of moving in the world .
And , if you think , you think , it 's a concept that it can give you hope .
Insilly , with the myriades of the world create a spiritual life of the world , and it 's important for the well-being flying planet and it 's important to the planet as a biological ragnoon as biosphere .
And you can think about this cultural ragnosphere and you can call the etnosphere and you can call the total sum ethnosphere , all concepts , dreams , ideas , intuitions , intuitions , intuitions are intuitions to be from human alba alone of the consciousness .
The etnosphere is the fantastic patriage of humanity .
It 's the symbol of what we are and what we can be as inquisitive species .
And because the biosphere was very much consumed as it has been very , very quickly , and unfortunately , much faster .
Nobody biologist , for example , it would say that 50 percent of all species was or is on the orlo of extinction just because it 's fake , or -- in the most apocaly-apocaly-apocaly-powerer issue . And it 's not even even even close to the most optimistic issue .
The index of that is , of course , language loss .
When you were born in there were 6,000 languages on this planet .
A language is not just composed by a vocabulary or a series of rules .
A language is the sprayer of human spirit .
It 's the middle of which the animal of every culture comes in the material world .
Every language is a forest , a backin , a backin , a thought , a crucial possibilities .
And of those 6,000 languages , while we are here in Monterey , at least half the mid-orecchies of the children .
They don 't get teacher , which means less you don 't sheets something , that are already dying .
What is more sad than being made of the silence , of being the last to talk a language , of being the last talk , of the language , of the wisdom of having to admit .
This is orring was in some of the world every two weeks . every two weeks , a old muor and it brings with her in the last syllabs and leads with it in the last syllabs of old syllabs .
And I know somebody 's going to say , " isn 't it much better ?
The world would not be a better place if I talk about all the same language ? " Benissim , so we talk all of yoruba . We talk about the dotond .
We talk about kogi .
You 're going to have a tract thing that means you can 't talk about your language .
I 'd like to do a journey through the etnosphere --
a small journey in the etnosphere to give you a asp of what we 're losing .
Most of us forget that when I say , " different ways to exist , " I mean different ways to exist .
We take for example this Barasana Barasana , in the Specentrional Amazond , who 's populated with anadic river , credit of provent in the east sacond of the eest saconia .
It 's a popular people who are not able to distinguish the blue color of the green , because the time it 's identified in the forest , which depends popular .
They have a strange language and a major , called " examia . " The language " " " " The " language " " " " " " " " " Exious "
All that has radical past mitological past , yet , yet the particular particular particular particular , is that in these expensive families where they 're talking about six or seven language because of the marriage of the mystery .
They 're going to listen and then they start talking .
We take one of the most interesting tribes I lived , the Waorans of Ecuador Nortortor North Ecuador , a incredible popular population that had the first contact in 1958 .
In 1957 five missionaries have tried a conduct in 1957 missionaries .
They did taken from the top photographs that they found them in a repet that they were going to think that this popular of pluvial forest that this popular of the forest .
They collected the land , they 've been shown them on the research of a shape or a shape , and they found nothing , they found out that it was the diavole , and they kill the five missionaries with the liance .
But Waorans don 't kill the stricers .
They were killed with them .
The 54 percent of the mortality was caused by themselves .
We are eight generations and found two cases of death , and we found two cases of natural and when we 've been reached , they 've been aged so much that he died aged , and then they 've been invecting it .
The hunters were able to recognize the animal urine from 40 steps and recognize the species .
In the early 1980s , I 've been assigned a really interesting task when my Harvard 's Haiti to me if I wanted to go to Haiti to go to Haiti to the base of Duvalier and Tonton Macookid 's the fabults that I 've been going to use the zombies .
And to give a sense of the miraculous , I should understand Vodoun culture . The Vodoo is not magic .
It 's quite a complex vision metaphysics of the world .
Very interesting .
If I asked you to ask me to tell me the great religions of the world , what would you ?
Cristianesimum , Islam , Buddismo , Ebraism , etc .
A continent is left out , thinking that the sub-Saharan Africa has no religious feds . And they 're the Vodoo is not other than the other than the distillside of these religious concepts of slavery .
What makes the interesting voodoo is the intended between life and death .
So , you know , they 're going to hide the spirits .
The spirits can invoced by the Great Acqua , they 're residding of the dance and they replace temporary temporary to the soul of the vial soul of the way that for a short moment .
So , for this vooyyists , you know , " You white , " Heem , white , " God .
We say in the temple and say God . "
And since you 're married , is the spirit that you 're driving you , how bad can you do it ?
So you 're in these incredible events : follow in voodoo in state of trance , that touch impunties are touch a rather strong demonstration of power of mind when it 's catalyzed in a state of extreme .
And all the popular of all the people I lived the most extraordinary of Sierra NSierra Navada , in the Specil , in the Spet Marta , in the Sectentrional Sectentrional Specentrional Scian .
It was descending of the tyrangan civilization that once were living on the caraibial plants , the popular of conquician , the popular of the vulcandy of the mail of the maxise of the charaibical planning .
In a continent macchieved , this popular continent , this popular is never been conquered by the Spanish .
But now they 've been governed by a clero , but their formation is so extraordinary .
The young people follows are taken from families to three or four years , and they live secret in a world of buy and shadow in a world made of pieces of ice for 18 years .
Two periods of nine years choices to reproduce the nine months of management that spend in the user-months of the mother , they are now metaphor in the usage of the Grange of Mother .
For that time , they 're acculturate to the values of their society , values that they 're predicting their pyyers and only their pycle , to keep the cost of ecological balance -- or to say the balance balance .
At the end of this incredible initiation , they 're suddenly taken out and for the first time in life , at 18 years , they see an oba . And in that moment in that consciousness of the first ball of the bank of beautiful , when the sun is the pespecially , it does it , all that they 've been learned in theory . And it 's just about it , and it 's going to be a spending , and it 's going to be like ,
" I said , " I said , " I told you .
It 's pretty amazing . Now it 's to you protect it . "
They call them as greater and say that we , the minors , we are the minors of the destruction of the world .
This level of intuition is extremely important .
When we think of Ingene populations and environment invote in the environment of the noble story of width , which is a razareas , as a concept in its own simplicity , which is a razareas and we are the neighbors .
The Ingenes are not feeling .
There 's no space for these things in the Asmat Asmat or the winds of the Tibet , but thank you for time and rate , they 've created a mystical inspiring of Earth , they 've created a mystical intuition of the Earth can only live in because it 's unhappy consciousness , but on an intuition that the Earth can only live in because it 's unhappy consciousness .
What does it mean ?
It 's going to be a little bit of Ande who is growing up believing that mountain is a spirit of Apu who will leave her a different human being being a very different human being being being being a different human being being being being being being being , and it will have a different deeply report that the mountain grow that grow up a mountain is that grow up a mountain of rocks .
which is the dimmour of a spirit or a mineral cabulous .
What 's interesting is metaphor that defines the relationship between individual and the natural world .
I grew up in the forests of the British Columbia credating that forest to be cut .
That made me a human being different from my friends Kwakiutl who believe that the forests are the forests of Hukuk and the bis histored of the paradise and the spiriters that are living in the nitem , we 're going to live in the Hamatsa .
If you start to consider that these cultures can create different reality , you can start to understand some of them feeling discoveries . We take this plant .
I 've taken this picture to open up in the nordoccctors .
Mayahuash , you 've heard of ayahuash , the most powerful psycotive substance of the Smelt repertoire .
What makes it fascinating the ayahuash is not the potential of the major , but its elecaboration . It 's made of two elements .
On one side , this lian land-a-carboline , harm and harm , and harm , and harmful , harm and molines , slightly hole .
Take the only plants , it has a blup that it 's a little bit of consciousness , but it 's measured with the leaves of a house-hold family .
This plant plant is powerful plant , very similar to seroonin , dimethyltryptamine-thyltryptamin-yptamine .
If you 'll ever see Yanomami , you 'll get to the bunch of the nose that they do for a different species , it 's a different methoxyptamine .
Tiring that dust on the nose is a little bit like to be disparated by a sunbars of painting blind eyes and land on a gload of electricity . [ Rissue doesn 't create a distorsion of reality .
I was often on my professor , Richard Evan Shultes , the man who had been skid , with her discovering the fungi was psychologic , with his discovery in the 1930s .
I think my way you can 't class these triptamines like hallucinogens , because if you can 't tell no one of being hallucinated .
It 's possible to be able to be in the horally only if they 're assume with other chemicals that are .
Now it comes the beautiful : Yes that bel carbs that are in this lian lian inhibitors of MAO , the same kind of necessary to potential triptamines . The souts are in-like , in a flour of them , they do the people find two deales are not like , but that if you combine in this way , create a biochemical version that 's sound that you are sound to the sum of the resident of the sum of the parts ?
We use the great eupherror and the mistake , that can reveal infruit .
But if you ask the Indians , they 'll say , " The plants are talking about . "
What does it mean ?
This tribes , the Cofan , has 17 varieties of ayahuasks , which are actually distinguess in the forest , and that our eyes would remain the forest , and that our eyes would remain species .
If you ask them how they 're going to stbilize them , " I thought , " I thought , I thought , " I thought I was all about all ? " I said , " No . "
The solution is : they take the 17 varieties in a night and each one will have a different tone .
With this doesn 't have been in Harvard , but it 's much more interesting than content the stami .
Now , [ applausi is that even those of us who have been heart of our own own heart people find them , but somehow reducts are paintings , but somehow reducts in the margins of the real world , and pass .
In fact , the X-century , in fact , it will not remind for its drives or innovations , but rather as the technologic innovations , but rather as the era where we were stopped and actively accepted , or accepted , and it 's not going to be the change .
All cultures through centuries have been involved in a dance for new life .
And the problem is not technology .
The Indians Sioux have no stop being Sioux when they put it from arc and fly , like Americans don 't have stopopped in American being when they put in the horse and calcies .
It 's not the change or technology that threats the integrity of the ethnosphere . It 's the power .
The hard fly fly .
And if you give a look at the world , you 'll find that these are not destinated in the world .
They 're living and dynamics and dynamics out of forces , they 're all about strong their adaptation skills .
It 's that it 's like to disboscing in the pathries of the Penan --
a popular nobble , in the Sarawasian East , a popular people who lived in free to a generation ago , and now reduced to the servitus and now reduced to the servitus , where you can see the river of the remindlim that seems to take a very much way to be a half a Meridional Meridian Meridional Meridional Meridional Meridional Meridional Meridional , where the horizon can be
With the forest .
Or , in Yanomami , are the disease that 's the disease that I 've come with the discovery of the gold .
If we move on on on the mountains of Tibet , where I 'm doing a lot of research , you 'll see the hard hard of politics .
As you know the genocide , the physics of a popular popular , is convicted at the level , but the ethnocide , the width of life of a popular popular , not only is celebrated in certain environments , because it does part of the development strategy of development .
And you can 't understand the suffering of Tibet until the beginning .
I 've been path the 6,000 miles from Child in China through Tibet , sudoriental , coming in Lhasa with a young colleague , but only came to in Lhasa young connection , but only came to Lhasa . I realized what 's behind the statistics we 've heard .
6,000 sacridust and cenables .
1.2 million people killed by military military in the Cultural Rivolution .
The father of this guy was ascriticized at Panchen Lama .
which means that it was killed for the temples of Chinese invasion .
Hist was sitting with Santity in Santity , in Sadiaspora that has taken people in Nepal .
Her mother was impriated and his colpe was to be rich .
It was brought to career at the age of two years of the age of two years under his gonna because it couldn 't have living without him .
The sister , who did the same , it was mit in reducation .
A day , he inaved a calculant fascinating Mao and , for this transgression , was mit to be done for seven years .
The Tibet of Tibet can be inoveroverwhelevate , but the recenter of the popular is to keep .
And finally , all of them reduce to a choice .
We want to live in the monothic world of monoonia or want to acacover the world of diversity ?
The great anthropologiet Mead , before he said that his greatest paper was that , in our going to be towards this view of the world , not only only we 'll see the whole range of human imagination reduced to a limited candle , but one day we 'll get on a sleeping for thinking , but one day we 'll get on a sleeping for a sleeping ,
And it 's umillion people remember that our species is exist for 60,000 years .
The Neolitics of the Neolitics , who did have been suck , which has done us underlies in the seed of the seeds of the skip , creating the gerarchian , creating gerarchia specialization , and we talk about 10,000 years ago .
The modern world industry has been in the middle of the world .
That 's the story doesn 't suggest that we have the answers to all the challenges that we 're going to have to deal in the millennia to come .
When these myriades of cultures of the world is asked what it means to be human , they 're in 10,000 different voices .
And it 's in these answers that we all have the chance of being what we are : a kind of conscious , that has to make all people all the garden can fide all the garden can fide . And there 's great moments of optimism .
I 've taken this picture on the northern island of Baffin the island of Baffin , when I went to the whales with Inuit , and this man , Olayas , Olayas ,
The Seadan government was not always gentle with the Inuit and in the ' 50s to stabilifests our supremies , we 've require them in colonies .
The grandfather of this man refuted .
The family , I teming her life , and I 'll take it all the acts .
You have to know that Inuit don 't have the cold , they can use it .
The packs in origin were made of fishes were made of short skin .
The grandfather of this man didn 't have to be in the retarttica , or from the library that was suffering .
It 's sgattaighted , and it 's calculated the ptall of foca and defecated in their hand . When I did did it . And when I did it , they 've been working on it .
It 's skip on the points of this clock , and when it became solid , he killed a dog .
It 's got taken out the dog and created a gold , with the cash actic , he created a slitta , and it 's disappeared another dog and it 's disappear to the bank , you know of cell , it in the cell .
We want to talk about cavareas with nothing ? [ Raune . ] And this , in different ways , [ Applausi is the symbol of the resilience of the popular Inuit 's the symbol of the world .
In aprimle 1999 , the canadvice government has reached the total control of a larger area of California and Texas mitted .
It 's their new pathry . It 's called Nunut .
It 's an independent land . They 're all the mineraries .
One splendid example of how a natione-state can recognize with its people .
And , to finish , I think it 's pretty obvious at least in those remote areas of us was in these remote aren 't conact .
For somebody 's house .
They represent slow human imagination that are rising at the stuff . And for all of us , the dreams of these children , like all of these kids , become part of the hope .

Thank you .
I 'm going to talk about some things I wrote in this book that I hope I 'll have heard and try to figure out some connections , in case , you wouldn 't notice them .
I want to start with what I call " the dogma " official dogma " . "
The official dogma of what ?
The official dogma of all the Western industrial society society . The official dogma official rewell-being of our citizens . " " The way to do it is , " The way to do it is to be more than our citizen . "
The reason is , from one side , in fact that freedom is in itself , useful , is useful , essential for human beings .
On the other is that if we are free , each of us can act for just doing everything that massive to do everything that massive our well-being , without no one that you decided in name .
The way to massive freedom is massimilar to massive freedom .
The more choices are the people , the more are free , and more of them is their freedom , the largest freedom , it 's their well-being .
This , I think , is so deeply radically radically radically , in society that nobody would dream that you would have to doubt it .
And it 's also roadicated in our lives .
I 'm going to show you some examples of what progress has made possible .
This is my supermarket . It 's not particularly big .
I 've got a simple note on on the injury .
In my supermarket , there are 175 conditions , without content 10 varieties of the olive oil and 12 acekeeps , and 12 aceful , which you can buy for you a huge number of conditions in the incbreakes that nobody of one of the 175 proning your degrees .
That 's what 's the supermarket .
Then you go to the electronic store : The CD lector , Rereo , Rector , radio , piaright , the practlificator .
And in this single crustore , there 's a great number of components .
We can do six million and a half million different combinations using the components that there are only in a store .
You have to admit that 's a lot of choice .
Other camps : the world of communications .
Once , when I was a kid , you could get all the phone services , at the break , and they were fornites by mom Bell .
It was going to leave the phone , you didn 't buy it .
A consequence of that , between the other , was that the phone never break .
These days are gone .
Now we have a variety of nearly illed with telephones , especially between cell phones .
Here 's the cell phone .
My favorite is that in the middle , MP3 , tall of nose , and forces for the brulelt cut .
If you don 't have yet seen it in the store under home , you 're well certain that soon will be .
And what happens to end is that people go into the goods and it does this question . And you know what 's the answer ? The answer is " No . "
It 's not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn 't make too much .
So , in other life that are much more important than the acquired of the acquired , the same same plosion of choices .
Axistence : no longer in the United States that you go from the doctor and the doctor of the doctor and the doctor you have to do .
Instead , I go to the doctor , and the doctor says , " OK , we could do A , or B , " A , " has these benefits . "
You say , " Dotore , what should I do ? "
And the doctor says , " A has these well-to-hold , and B has these benefits and risks . "
" What do you want to do ? "
And you say , " Dotore if she was me , what would it do ? "
And the doctor : " But I 'm not . "
The result of the result of maluth , " authonomy of maluth , " which does seem like a beautiful thing .
But it 's actually not that that a move the weight and responsibility to decisions from somebody who knows something , is the doctor , to someone who knows anything -- and it 's not about anything -- and so it 's not about anything -- and so it 's not in the ideal condition to take the patient decisions .
There 's a huge marketing of drug products , direct people like me and you , that if you think you don 't have any sense , because you think you can 't buy them .
But if we can 't buy them , why do they have to do it ?
The answer is that they want to domorning , we call the doctor to ask them to change the recipe .
Something that 's like our identity is our identity is recivil to this , " We don 't want to forced children . " We don 't want to forced children . " We don 't want to forceat at the right moment , " we have to inventing it .
And we can reinvented how many times we do it .
which means that every morning , at the risk , you have to decide that kind of person you want to be .
It was at the family and marriage , a time perspective , unhappy , it was almost for anyone , was that it was that it was ever ever ever there was that was that it was ever possible , and it was that it was that it was ever possible .
The only real choice was with who , not when , and it 's not when , and even even what to do after .
Ose , it 's really like to play .
I teach students very intelligent students , and I do 20 percent of work than a time .
And it 's not because they are not so brilliant , because they are not less diligent .
but why are I impensierites , I mean , I should I have to marry or not ? I have to do it now ? "
" Do I have to marry later ? I have to think before or career ? "
They 're interrogatives .
And they 're trying to answer these questions , even if this implication doesn 't have to full the compitors that I check and not getting a beautiful vote to my exame .
And they really have to do it . They 're important questions .
Now , the work : we are lucky , like the underneath of the subolyced , because technology allows us to work every minute , every day , from every day , from every angle of the planet , except that Hotel Randolph .
And I 'm talking , there 's a angle , and I didn 't tell anyone what , where WiFi works .
I don 't tell you , because I want to use it .
What does this mean , this incredible freedom of choice that we have about work ? It 's that we have to continue , and still every time , if we have to work or not .
We can go to see our son boy , with the cell phone in a pocket , the Blackberry in the other , and the notebook , typically , on the ginock .
And even though they 're all spent , every minute that we see our son son son son 's partners , we also ask , " Do you know this called ? "
" I have to answer this literate ? I have to abbozzy this literally ? "
And even when the answer is " no , " all this makes the experience of your son 's game of very different than what it would have been in other conditions .
So , as much as we look at , little things and great , materials and life , life are a question of choices .
And once the world was this : Ovice , there were some possibilities , but it was not a matter of choice .
The world of today looks like this : The dilemma is , " Is it a positive thing , or negative ? "
The answer is Sorry .
The positions are all the way we all talk about negatives .
All this choice compories two effects of negative effects on people .
The first , paradoxically , it 's that it makes a paralycling .
With a topons of which choose , it becomes very difficult to do it .
I give you an example : a conduct study of plans of volunteer pensioning .
A connects to it , I 've got access to the Vaney data , the giant society of deep pension , with about a million clients in 2,000 different companies .
What she found out was that for every 10 solutions that are actually come in more , the percentage of two percent .
With 50 offer-functional , there 's 10 percent in less than adexions than when they are available . Why ?
Because with 50 sour-four-four-four-four-four-to-like , and the choice is remained to initimors .
And I asked , and I still asked , I still wondered , I , and of course , I would never come .
You know , it doesn 't mean that these old work from old work .
They don 't participating , they 're losing until five thousand dollars for year from work , which would be very much .
So , the paralysis a consequence of having too many choices .
And I think it makes the world like this .
" And to finish , for ethcheternity : ketchup , senape or maionese ? "
You 'd just take the right decision , if it 's for ethnity , isn 't it ?
You don 't want to choose the wrong background , and yet the wrong condition .
So this is the first effect . The second is that we can even avoid parality and do a choice , we finally are fewer by the result of how we were with less options of how we were with less options .
And this for different reasons .
One of these is that with many conditions between which you 're choose , if you buy one and it 's not perfect , it 's not easy to imagine that you would have been able to do a different choice that would be better . And that 's that it 's that alternative ints would be better . And that 's just a little bit of a satisatif-up . And that 's just decrease .
even when it was a good decision .
There 's more choices , it 's more easy to dislit than any detail that is insodatives that it 's insodatives .
And there 's what economists call cost .
Dan Gilbert said , very well stamattine like the value that we give things things to depends on what we 're confronted with .
And , when there are options , there are options , it 's easy to represent the highnative of the alternative artment of the option that you have been chosen .
Here 's an example . I 've all been schooling with all those who are not New York .
But that 's what you 'd probably think .
There 's this pair to Hamptons .
A place of lussian place .
It 's fold . It 's all right now . It 's all for them .
Not nothing . But what he thinks is , " Well , males , it 's Agosia . "
" All my neighbors in Manhattan are on . "
" I could talk about it right home . "
And it 's going to go through two weeks I 've been seeing this is persing -- every day -- the possibilities of parking where it wants .
The expensive opportunity decrease the soddisfaction for what we have , even when the choice was cell .
And the other people are the options that we have to think , more the actracks will come to the expensive opportunity .
Here 's another example .
This is tells us a lot of things .
It 's about living , and maybe maybe living in slowly .
But the most important point is that you want to do , you know , you 're not doing other .
The things that we don 't choose to active , that we can make less attractive what we do .
Third point : spiral growing of expectations .
I tried it on my skin buying a new jeans .
I 'm almost always jeans .
Once the jeans were just like , buy them and they were bought , and they were besty , were discomodissies , just after having them a lot of times , began to go well .
So , I went to buy a couple of new when those old were gone , and I said , " I need a couple of jeans , this is my cut . "
The committer said , " Lake slim , but it 's a fit , axed ? "
Do you want to do with the cerniera or " Stonewashed , " " " acidjed " ? "
" Look , " Have you ? "
" Have you them to do it ? Blaw blah blah blah .
I was sbalored , and after a little bit , I could say , " I want the guy that was the only guy that was the only kind of " I want to do , " I want to all jewiring jeans , and then I was out of the store , I 've got out of the wear , I 've ever had .
It was the most of that I had the best .
But I felt I was worse .
Why ? I wrote a whole book for understand it .
The reason I was worse is that with all that choices my expectations were very high , jeans had to be perfect .
I didn 't expectations of all the exciting thing that was expectations when there was only one of 100 different , but when I saw 100 different , steps , like it had to be perfect .
What I was getting was good , but not perfect .
And after that I was talking about what I was trying to do with what I was trying to do was unsatisfied in comparative to expectations .
The added options in life of people don 't do that increasing the expectations that these are respecececective .
And this will also be less satifation , even when the results are good .
Nobody in the marketing world , it realized .
Because if they knew , you wouldn 't know what I 'm talking about .
The truth looks more like this .
" It was better when it was worse . " The reason that was better when it was worse was that when it was worse was even possible to meet some surprised surprised .
And they 're in the world we live in -- opulent , industry , industry citizens with performation expectancy -- the massive that we can hope is that things are at the altitude of expectations .
You never have life-like , because your expectations , my expectations , they 're ingantic .
The secret of happiness -- what you 're here -- is , " Baxis . "
I mean , small , I mean , small moment , which I really married and my wife is really amazing .
I couldn 't do better , I didn 't have to be able .
But it 's not always a bad thing .
And finally , a consequence of buying a couple of jescope when there 's just that jeans is that when you 're not satisfacts , and I ask you , " Why ? "
" Who responsible ? " , the answer is clear .
The world is responsible . What could I do ?
When there are hundreds of kinds of jeans , and you buy a insatisfacing , and ask you who 's responsible , it 's the responsible , is the light-clearly that the responsible you .
You 'd have done better .
With hundreds of varieties , there are no skeeps for insuccess .
So when people take decisions , even though the result is , they 're all feeling and they 're satives , they 're satives , they 're satives .
In the last few years , the depression is exploded in industry .
I think a meant factor -- not the only one , but important -- of this honate depression is that people have a deluse experience because standard are too high .
And when they have to explain this situation think that the colpe is their .
So the final result is that we 're better , objectively , but we feel worse .
Let me remember that .
This is the official dogma , what we all take for good and it 's completely fake . It 's not true .
There 's no doubt that a little bit of choice is better than I 've ever ever done , but it 's not a lot of choice is better than a little bit .
There 's a critical value , I don 't know what it is .
But I 'm pretty sure that we 've been done by a piece of a piece where choices are improving our life .
Now , from the political point of view , I 've almost finished -- from the political point of view , the cracy is the following .
What allows you all this choice in the industrial society is the wealth .
There are many places in the world , and you know , you know , where the problem is not that they have any choice .
The problem is that they have too much .
So the factory I 'm talking about is a malbeing exclusive to be exclusive , Western society .
And what it does depress and array is this : Steve Levitt you 've talked about how expensive those expensive and discoseats . It 's a spring of money . It 's a sprite of money .
I mean these choices , complicated and available , it 's not that they 're just inuseful .
I 'm a deleterie .
They 're going to be worse .
If a little bit of what our society is allows so they were reversed in those where people have too much possibilities , it would not just be their life to improve but our .
This is what economists call a paretian improving .
A redistribution of income redistribution for all -- not only to poor -- because of this choice in excess , that we have .
And so I said , " You can get everything you want " --
You , people of culture , you think , " What does that fish ? "
" It 's obvious that you can 't get anything in a glass . "
" A recastrated , a limited view of the world -- "
and I 've been interpret that this , at the beginning .
But then , I realized , instead , I realized that that fish knows the long .
Because the reality of the facts is that if you send it , you can 't do it . " You get the freedom . "
If you break the cabulous way that everything is possible to decrease satifation .
You 're going to be the paralysis , and you 're going to reduce .
They all need a sphere .
This is almost certainly too much , maybe even for the fish , and it 's certainly for us .
But it doesn 't have any symbobot is a recipe for infelity and , for ruin the dry .
Thank you very heart .
