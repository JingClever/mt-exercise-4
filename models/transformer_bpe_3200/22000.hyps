I 've showed these these slides to show that the glacial calott-hoottical calottical , which is about the 48 million years has been the size of 48 United States continental , you have to be about 40 percent .
But this underground , it 's a gravity of the problem because it 's not shows the spessor of the ice .
The artical calotta 's calotta 's calotta , in a sense , the global climate system .
You go out of winds and you get the summer .
The next slide is going to be a quick carrelated to the last 25 years .
The prayaces are signed in red .
You see , they expand to the blue .
That 's the ice in the winter , which is ritira of summer .
You can see that the cosidamage of five years , or more , is like blood , which is like blood , which is like blood .
In 25 years , it 's been like that .
This is a problem because the heat , the whole thing is about the ground , where there are huge amount of carbon , where there are huge amounts of carbon congelated that , leaves , they 're transformed in the microbes .
I 'm going to respect to the totality of global warming , that amount of global warming , that amount of not return .
In some shining laghi , in Alaska metane is already rebolling from water .
The professor of Alaska University of Alaska is a team in the Alaska team , it 's a fast last winter .
Video : Wow ! Al Gore : Wow ! The question is if we 're going to be .
It 's a reason that is that this termician exchange of the Groenland from the north .
This is a glacial regime .
And he had never reached to levels it .
This is the Kangerlussuaq , in the west of Groenland .
If you want to know how the sea level of the sea , for the sea path of the rafers , here is where the sea .
These currents are going to be very quickly .
Over the other side of the planet : Antartide , the biggest blown of ice the planet .
The month of the scientists have dichieve that the ice of the ice is in the negative , and the Western Antartide , which pogggy on some hythm islands , it 's particularly fast in the month .
Equial at six feet of the activity , like Groenland .
Himalayas , the third largest blown of ice , you see new laghi , which few years ago , they were glaciers .
40 percent of the world population will get a half of the world 's population to be a little bit of the water .
Sulle Ande : this glacier is the source of this city .
Suck it 's increased .
But when it comes , it 's the same way happens , you get it to the water .
In California , the nenow , the nenow , in California ,
The idricrical kins are in crisis .
The predictions , as you read , they 're good .
The growing security in the world leads to a remarkable remarkable aughters .
The environmental disasters are increasing a rhythm outside the normal and without previous .
Four times more numheroes in the last 30 years , I previous previous 75 .
This is a well-and-shape .
If you look at the historic consequences if you can see the consequences .
In the last five years we added 70 million tons of CO2 every 24 hours -- 25 million tons of the ocean every day .
Look at the area of the East Pacific East , as the as the as the as the west of the Indian continent , where there is a radical impoverty in the ocean .
The major cause of global warming , with deforestation , which is 20 percent , is the fossil fuel use of fossil fuel .
The oil is a problem , and carbon is even worse .
The United States is one of the two countries with more emissions , together to China .
And it was proposing to build a lot of other carbon carbon .
But we 're seeing a direction of a direction .
These are the anullated projects in the last few years and some green alternative proposes of green .
Every way , there 's a political load in our country .
The carbon industry and the oil industry have spent 250 million dollars in the last year to promoting carbon , which is a oxymous .
And that image reminded me something --
Natal , in Tennessee , where I live , there was a loss of 3.8 billion gallons of carbon .
Maybe you 've seen about news .
This is the second bigger flow of the last flow of the last flow of the past ,
It 's happened around Natal .
The note advice of one of the carbon industry was this .
Video : It 's going to be a very high---allegrand happy .
It 's abundant here in America , and it 's growing our economy .
Frosty carbon is more and smaller .
It 's good price , and it 's good , and they 're going to keep the stage .
Al Gore : From here 's a lot of the West Virginia .
The bigger main minerair , is Massey Computer . This is its administrator .
Video : Don Blankenship : At t Al Gore , Nancy Pelious , Harry Reid -- they don 't know what they 're talking about .
Al Gore : So the Alleance for the Clima Protext has two campaign .
This is a part of them .
Video : AtLergy : Alla COALergy , we see climate change as a sery to our business .
So , in our priority is to invest a large amount of money in a effort to make public and confused to make public and confused to make public and confused in the carbon .
In fact , carbon is not spored .
We think it 's clean -- it 's also a good profum .
So , not precues of climate change .
Let 's do it .
Video : Actually : Carbone , you 've heard a lot of talk about it .
So let 's take a turn into a structure to the horg of the pulit of the pulit .
Straordinary ! The machines are a little rainer , but this is the sound of carbon technology .
The carbon consumption is between the main causes of global warming , but the fuel consumption of the global warming , but the fuel of carbon ,
You look at a look : this is the odiergn of carbon .
Al Gore : Finally , the positive alternative of the economic issue and the national security .
Video : Comment : America is in crime ; the economy , the national economy , climate crisis .
The physical that connects all : our dependence from fossil fuel combustible , like carbon fuel , and oil practice .
Now , but there 's a new , audace ,
Repower : 100 percent of clean energy , in 10 years .
A to put America to put America to work , make us sure more certainly , and help stop the global warming .
Finally , a solution that bastes to solve our problems .
Repower . Scoprice more .
Al Gore : This is the last one .
Video : How about it : It 's about requires to America .
One of the fastest ways of to bring to the dependence of the combustible that kill our planet .
Compars : The future is here . I 'm in the sun , a new energy network .
Novi investments , Novi investments for two retribites of work ,
Nexment : Repower . It 's time to be realists .
Al Gore : A old proverbio is an old African says , " If you want to go fast , you go to fast .
If you want to go away , you go back together . "
We have to go away , fast .
Thank you very much .
LHC flew at TED fall .
And promise to get back to the way to get travel to how the machine works .
So here I 'm here . And for the ones that have no , LHC is the biggest scientific experiment ever that we had -- 27 kilometers of circumstances .
His task is to rerecognize the conditions that were at less than a billion , in the universe -- until 600 million times a second .
That 's just environments .
This is the car under Ginevra .
We 're going to take these min-Big Bang in the detectors .
That 's what I work . It 's called ATLAS -- it 's about 44 meters and has a diameter in 22 meters .
This is a spectacular picture of ATLS in construction so you can see the proportions .
Toks about 10 to the first time .
And this picture was taken by ALS .
It was because of immense festeggments in control .
It 's a picture of the first fascination that had done all the LHC , both in collision , deliberately , dollar , with a part of the LHC , and spread particles into the detector .
In other words , when we see that image 10 skid , we realize that the machine worked , which is a great wittory .
I don 't know if it was this to be exultar , when somebody went on on Google and saw the beginning of the beginning was this .
That means we have had a cultural impact beyond the scientific impact .
About a week later , there was a problem with the car , had to do this here -- these physics sicians .
These fili are 13,000 amps when the machine works at the massign of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the massim .
Now , the technicians of you will look at the physical and they 'll say , " It 's not true . I 'm too overwhissue . "
And they can do it because when they 're very cool of the super-file , they 're superconcerned by the way .
So , at least 271 degrees , at least 271 degrees , in the space between stars , these things can bring that current .
In one of the giunture of the most novemile in the LHC , there was a defect of fabrication .
So the file is going to get a slightly , and the 13,000 amping improvised a electrical resistance .
This was the result .
Now , this is even more impressive if you think that these magneti fish more than 20 tons , and you 've been moved about 30 centimeters .
You know , you 're damage about 50 magneti .
We had to take them , what we did .
We repressed them and enaged and traveling .
They 're going to return all to their underground place .
British the end of the LHC is going to be a whole new integral .
We 're going to access it , and we expect to get the data or the lude or the lude of the course of the things that are the morning that they 're going to get the universe .
Now , of course , in a certain way , these accidents reaccend up the value of science and engineering in front of science and engineering in front . It 's easy to convict .
I think that the fact that it 's so hard , the fact that it 's the value of things like LHHC .
I 'd like to end up with the words of a English scientists , Humphrey Davy , which , in defense of the inuseful experiments of his pupille , his pupille Faraday , he said , " Niastent is so dangerous for the progress of human mind how the human rent is definitive to the human mind how the mind that the science of science of the human mind , and not a few things that we don 't have new . "
Thank you .
I want to start to ask you to rethink about when , as a kids , you played up on the morone-on-up moroning .
As you can get to get them and deal with them , and take them and move them , and you 're going to move them , and you know , and we 're going to be able to think and solve .
The space reasoning is deeply connected to the way we understand the most part of the world around us .
So , from the inspired use of our physical interaction with physical objects , together to my Packs , and my collaborator Jeevan Kalanithi , I started asking to ask , " And if we use a computer , instead of having the cursor of mouse as a digital pollen , and we could deal with a desktop , we could trusually affect a computer , we could to do a hands ,
and sist-like .
The question was so interesting that we decided to explore the answer , building Siftable .
In a few words , a Siftable is a great interactive computer as a biothing .
In a few words , a Siftable is a great interactive computer as a biothing .
You can move them with her hand , they can see their hand , " you can see their movement and they have a screen and a screen and a wireless .
But most of course , are physical objects , as the morning , you can move to simply affirs .
The Siftable is the example of a new ecosystem of tools to manipulate digital information .
And as they become more physical , conscious , conscious of the movement , and as they become more physical , of the movement , of others , as we can explore new and fun and different styles of interaction .
I 'm going to start with some simple example .
This Siftable is configured to show the video : if you 're going to put it into a direction , video , video ruotherwise , video like that , if you 're going to go back .
These interactive rates are aware of of others .
If you hold them , they 're interested what 's about them .
If they 're surrounded , they can see it and they can act a little bit .
If they 're surrounded , they can see it and they can act a little bit .
They also have their movement and inclination .
We then realized that one of the interesting implications of the interaction was to be able to use managed by data , to " a color like it was a liquid .
In this case , we have three Siftable configured as a bespecially and I can use them to the color in that central , where you mix .
and I can use them to be a lot of the color in that central , where they 're mischieve .
If we 're too much , we can put a little bit in place .
There are beautiful possibilities of apprentice , like language , the language , the mathematics and the logic of logic , where people can try things fast , and see the results immediately .
Now I 'm now --
This is a Resencisequence that I 'm doing with a program of equations .
Here we have a words that is in half the Scarabeo and Boboble .
Pratically , at every turnal turnal , at every Siftable , Pratically , every Siftable , Pratically , every Siftable , and as you know , he controlled him on a dictionary .
Then , after about 30 seconds , you have a new set of reading and new possibilities to try .
Thank you .
Here 's what children came to Media Lab , I did it in a way that I tried them and I went to a video .
They have a lot of them .
And one of the interesting things of this kind of application is that we don 't have to give people a lot of education .
You just say , " Compons of words , and they know exactly what to do .
Here 's here , other people who try it .
This is our young Again 's our younger tester , there on the right .
It was actually wanted to be impilling them .
They 're just in the moroncking-day .
Now , this is a application of a interactive cartoon .
We wanted to build a tool for the Lui apprentice of language is Felix .
It can put characters in the scene , by lifting Siftable to associated with them .
It can put characters in the scene , by lifting Siftable to associated with them .
So , it 's doing the sun .
Video : Sun 's source .
David Merrill : Now it 's now brought a hold hold .
Video : Holden treat treat hold .
Bel work ! Yeah !
So , you get the Siftable and put up close can make characters --
Video : Bau !
-- by inventing your story .
Video : Hi !
DM : It 's a story with the open , and it can decide him as you get to do it .
DM : It 's a story with the open , and it can decide him as you get to do it .
Video : Video , cat .
DM : The last example I 'm going to show you is a tool , I 'm going to show you a tool , to sample and exeguing music .
It 's a tool , made of recent , to tramples and make music .
The Siftable here are act as the bass , the bass and the battery .
Each one of these have four different variations , and you can choose what to use .
You can also put these sound in a sequence to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to put these sound in a sequence to be able to be able to do it .
And it 's just just by making a sound , and a sequence . "
These are actually actually you can control from the live , like the reverber and the movies .
It 's a particular sound and then inclens for a particular sound , and then inclens .
And then there are the general effects as time and fly , that they 're going to apply to the sequence .
We look at how it works .
Video : We 're going to start putting a base in two Siftable sequence , we put it in a series , we add in a series , we add the other base .
Now I put a line of the bottom line .
Video : Now , I add of percussions --
Video : And I 'm going to put the bacteria , so I can control the effect from the live of the living .
Video : I can fast the whole sequence is going to be a stronger inclining time from one side , or another .
Video : I 'm going to add to add the bass to give more expression .
Video : I can recombine the sequence of the flight .
So I don 't have to plan it before , but I can improvising , and it 's more cord .
And now , I can spend the whole sequence by the way , the British of the Bededding .
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is to build new mo-stly engaged machine and the body to work and body .
And today , I 've had time to show you one results of this path , and even some chance we try to bring out of the lab .
The concept I want to transmitted is that it 's coming to this new generation of the design of the digital media , which will bring information in our world in the way we want .
Thank you very much .
I don 't see the time to talk to all of you .
I 'm a writer .
I 'm going to be books is my profession , but it 's more than that , of course .
It 's also love and the fashion of my life .
And I don 't expect that it can change .
But , I said , something particularly happened in my life and my career , which brought me to recently the whole relationship with this work .
The particular thing is that I recently written this book , this whoever called " Mangia , Prega , " The Ama , " which is diversally , in the world and it became a big , and it became a big , bestseller , international feelational ,
And the result is that everywhere is now , people treat me as if you were conconvicted .
It 's true -- convicted , convicted .
They 're all worried and they say , " Do you have no longer to do better ?
You have to keep writing for all the life without being able to create a book that can be able to make a book that can be importance to somebody ? "
What can it be to somebody ? "
It 's certainly , you know .
But it could go worse , part of the one remember I remember that more 20 years ago , when I started to say to people -- I was a writing -- I was a writer .
I would put it up to the same reaction , it 's based from fear .
And people said , " Don 't I 'm not temes to have success ?
You have to feel that the umillion of the refuse of the refuse you ?
You have to do this mestify for all life without anything about it comes and death and to die of a lot of infrants with the mouth of the raw wl to the pile of the willness of failure ? "
So , you know .
The answer to all these questions is : " Yes . "
Yes , I 'm fear of all those things .
I 've always had fear .
And I 'm also fear of the other things that people can 't have to guess .
As the algap and other things .
But , as it 's about writing what I thought and I would say , " What I 'm going to ask me , why ?
Is it rational ?
It 's logical that anyone has to expect to be spended by a job that you 've been born to do .
But what is that particular , in the impress and creative , and it 's about the mental health health health health health care in a way that other career don 't do ?
As my father , for example , he was a chemist engineer and I don 't remember one time in his 40 years of activities that he asked if he was asked if he was a little bit of engineer ?
There was never -- that blown to engineer John , how does it happen ?
It didn 't work , you know ?
Onestly , chemistry engineers as a group have no matter , in the centuries , wars the reputation of being alcolized maniaces .
We have writers , we have enough to do this reputation , and not just writers , but creativity of every kind of , we have this reputation of being enormous .
And it 's not to look at the contedent of the magnification of the magnificments that , only in the 20th century , they die young and often .
And even the ones that don 't have any sounds like to be really disfaced by their dones .
Norman Mailer , before I die , in the last interview said , " Every book , " Every book , " Every book , " an extraordinary affermation about the work of their life .
But we don 't get the board when we hear that that we 've heard these things so long that we 've been completely interiorized and accepted the notion that creativity and suffering are in some ways and that the art , at the end , at the end , it will always always always flow to the angoal .
And the question I want to take all of today is : are you agree with this idea ?
It 's good , because it 's also about it from a centimeter of distance to me , it 's not good for this supposition .
I think it 's hate .
And I think it 's dangerous and I don 't want to see the perpetate in the next century .
I think it 's better to encourage our big creative minds to live .
And certainly I know that , in my case -- in my situation -- it would be very dangerous to start to the dark of suppocket , in fact , you know , in my career .
Or , you look at , they 're quite young , I 'm quite young , I have about 40 years .
I 've got about four decades of work in me .
And it 's very likely that everything I 'm going to be judged by the world like the work that I went out after the world as the success of my last book .
I 'm going to be slavery , because we 're all more or less friends here -- it 's likely to my behind .
Oh , Gesus , who thought !
You know , this is the kind of thought that leads a person to start bing gin the nine of the morning and I don 't want to do it .
I would keep going to keep doing this work that I love .
So , the question becomes , how ?
And so I 'm going to be , after a lot of reflflections , which the way to do to get to write is to create a psychological construction , right ?
I have to find a sense of security distance between me , which I 'm writing , and my natural anxiety of what the writing is going to write . And as I was trying to do it as I begin to watch through time , trying to find other society to see if they could have to be better ideas and more healthy than they could have better ideas and sane and sane .
how to help people make creative to run the inherent emotional risks of creativity .
And that research brought me to the ancient Grek and ancient Rome .
Seguiteguiteges , because I 'm going to go back .
In the ancient Greek and ancient people don 't seem to believe that creativity to come from men , OK ?
And it was thinking that creativity was this spirit , they would be the wine and they were in men from one of some kind of distant and unknown , for distant reasons and unknown .
The Great called these spirites were called these spirits of creativity .
Socrate , wonderful , he believed to have a elecargggeity from far far away from the far away .
The Rooms were the idea , but they called that sort of spirit without a genius .
That 's great , because the Roands didn 't think that a genius was a very intelligent .
They thought a genius was this kind of devices that had been living in the walls of an artist study , a little bit like the electric of an artist , a little bit like the electric of artist and to invent the result of artist and models the result of that work .
Exxxial -- here 's the distance of which I 'm talking about -- that psychological construction that protects you to protects of your work .
And they all knew that it was how it worked , right ?
So the anti-artists were protected by certain things , as much as a way , for example , too much narcible , no ?
If your work was exceptional , you couldn 't take the everything , you know that the wirdly , they would have been helped by this genius .
If your failed work , it was not all colpe , right ?
Everybody knew that it was your genius to be a inable .
And so people han conceived creativity in the West for a long time .
And then the Rinascivil came and everything , and it changed , and it 's a lot of idea ; we put human being over the universe over all the mysteries and without leaving space creatures .
This was the humans principle of rational and people started thinking that creativity came from the ilishes .
And for the first time in history , you start to refly this or artist as a genius , as a genius , as a person with genius .
And I have to tell you , I think it was a big mistake .
I think that allow somebody , a simple person to believe that it 's a recipient as a recipient , the essence and the source of all the mysteries , creativity , creativity , and it 's a very big physical physical ,
It 's as to ask someone to enjoy the sun .
Deform and demor demand , you create all these ingestifty airly .
And I think it was this pressure of having the artists in the passed 500 years .
And , if this is true , and I think that it 's the question becomes , and now ?
Can we do it diversity ?
Maybe you go back to a more ancient understanding of the relationship between humans and creative mystery .
Or maybe no .
Maybe we can 't dog 500 years of rational thinking in a 18 minutes .
And there 's probably people in the audience that would be reading the scientific scientific , on the notion of , fairy , they would follow the next to their projects .
Probably not convinced all of this thing .
But the question I 'd like to ask is -- why not not ?
Why don 't it think about this way ?
Because it 's more sense of everything that I 've ever heard to explain the exaspersive imprevebility of the creative process .
A process that 's like anyone who ever tried to do something -- so , basically , all here -- you 're not going to be compete rationally .
And , in fact , it can sometimes be completely paranormous .
I did this meeting recently with the recently Ruth Stone , who has now 90s , but he was a poeter for all life and he said that during his childhood in the rural Virginia , working outside the fields , and he felt it , in if a poem was coming from the landscape .
He said that it was like a fragorous train of the air .
And he came to her to the way to her from the landscape .
He felt it , because he was going to try to get the earth under his feet .
He knew he had one thing to do at that point and was , his words , " With the way a matta . "
And it 's going to hold it and it was going to be infollowed by this poem , and it would have to take a piece of paper and a math , and it would collect it on the page .
Other you could not be fast , so it correcve and correcrecve and correcrecve and he would not get to get to the house and the rotolar through and she loved and he would continue to rotolar through the landscape , trying , as she said , " another poet . "
Then there were those times -- this piece is not dementize -- there were the moments where the was almost losing , OK ?
So , he was running home and he was trying to do the card and the standard was going through , and he was going to go through , and then he said , which was like if you go away with the other hand and the handed .
And he had the poem of the coda and remain his body and he would turn it into its body and the page .
And in these cases , the poem would be presented on the perfect and intact , but the last word to the first .
So when I felt I thought -- it 's very crazy , it 's exactly the same same ,
Not all my creative process -- they 're not a conconstruct .
I 'm a mulo , and my way to work is ; you get up to get up to the same orary every day and play and go through the god .
But even I , in my aggin , I 've been brought against that thing , sometimes .
And I guess that many of you have the han done .
You know , even though the work and ideas came up with me , you can 't honestly , you can 't be honestly .
And what is this thing ?
And how can we relate to it in a way that we don 't lose your head , but , rather , what do we do do is to be healthy ?
As it 's about , the best contemporary contemporary , which I have a Tom Waits musician 's Tom , which I 've interviews different years ago for a day .
We were talking about this , and you know , Tom , for the majority of life has been the incarnation of the indeed artist , trying to control , dominating these species of impulses , dominating , dominating these species of the impulents of the impulses .
But then he invecent , I 'm going to get to the way on a road in Los Angeles , he changed everything for him .
He was going to fast and everything , and it 's a little bit of a traat ser , which is in his head as an inspiration , and it 's alusive and the wants , you know , it 's wonderful , and the desider , but it 's not about how to take it .
It 's not a piece of card , it has no mit , it has no registrator .
So I started to hear this old species of old old , and he 's going to be able to lose , and I 'm going to remain obsessed sessionated by this song always loss .
I 'm not good enough and I can 't do it . "
And instead of going to go to the panic , you stop .
I 'm going to hold the whole process and he had something completely new .
He just just look at the sky and he said , " Scuses , you don 't see that I 'm driving ? "
" Who looks like that can write a song now ?
If you really want to be there , you get a little bit more opporting one when I can take care of you .
Other , you go to importantly someone else today .
You 're going to disturban Leonard Cohen . "
And his process has changed by this .
Not work , the work was still dark , I know , it was still dark .
But the process , and the fish that was remained when he was refed when the genius , the genius that he was out of him , the genius that he was going to be , and he remain it back from where he was , realizing that he had to be a interized and handscaped .
but you know , it 's wonderful , beautiful bizarra collaboration between Tom and this strange and external thing that it was not Tom .
So , what I felt about that story , how to change a little bit even the way I was working and I 'm going to save me once .
This idea , I was writing , I was writing " Mangia , " Ama , " and it fall in one of those cave disperation where we 're all working on something and we can 't do and you start thinking that 's going to be a disaster , which is going to be the worst book .
Not just bad , right , right the worst book written .
And I started thinking about giving this project .
But then I remind I was talking about the air and I tried to do it .
So I went up to my face on the guns and I 'm committed my face to a vacuum of the room .
And I said , " His , what , you 're going to go to it , both if this book is not going to be brilliant , no matter ?
Because as I 'm putting it all I have , I don 't have to do that .
So if you want to be better , you have to presented you and do your part .
OK . But if you don 't do it , you know what , I don 't do it .
I 'm going to write the same because it 's my work .
And I 'd like to do that that was registrated that I 'm presented to do my part , " Because -- at the end is so , OK -- centuries ago in the Northern Africa , the dances of the moon , and the music and sacres and sacres and hold to the stuff .
And they were always magnifically , because the ballerins were professionals and they were fantastic .
But every long , rarely , something happened , and one of these artists became transcendent .
And I know you know what I 'm talking about , because you 've all seen , at a certain point , a performance so .
It was like if the time , and the ballerine walked through a kind of land-up , and it was not doing anything different from the usually , like 1,000 night , but it was all waste .
And suddenly , not just as a human human .
But it 's accese from the divinity in the winity of divinity .
And when this next , the time , the people knew what was , they would call it .
They would give their hands and they started dog , " Allah , Allah , Allah , Allah , Allah , God , " God , "
That 's God , you know .
Curious note -- when the Mororan invaded Spain , I was this habits with their and the pronounced and the pronunced in the centuries of Allah , " to " Ole , Allah , " to " Ole , " , " which you can still hear in the corrids or in flamp .
In Spain , when a artist did something impossible and magic , " Allah , " Allah , " Allah , " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " Allah , " " " " " " Alah , " Actually , " Allah , " Allah , " Allah , " Allah , " Allah , " Allah , " Allah , " Allah , " Allah , " Allah
And it 's great because we need it .
But , the problem comes down the day , for the dang , when you get up and discover that are the 11 of Martedesh and the last last thing that is about .
It 's just a mortal mortal with gran evil , and maybe it will never get to get that altitude .
And maybe nobody 's going to be a name of God , and what does it have to do with the rest of his life ?
It 's hard .
This is one of the most painful recogniliations to make in a creative life .
But perhaps it doesn 't have to be so angry if you can 't believe , mostly , that the most extraordinary aspects of your being from yourselves .
But you know , just that you 're going to be prested by a unimaginable source of this team part of your life that you have to go to someone else when you finished .
And , you know , if we think that it 's in this way it changes .
And so I started thinking about it , and it 's certainly how I thought about a few months in the work of the book that I 'm going to be on , the dangerous , spenty , I 'm going to take it to be followed to my great success .
And what I have to continue to tell me when I feel electric .
It 's not just flow . It 's just your work .
Continua presentation of your part , any can be .
If your work is dancing , ball .
If the divine , you know , you know , if you get a deal with leave to a few kinds of wonderful , for one moment through your effort , then " Ole ! "
Or , you do the same your dance .
And " Or ! " at the same same .
I think , and I think , you have to teach it .
" Or ! " at the same , even , even even for human and testing and testotic teams to be represent . "
Thank you .
Thank you .
June Cohen : Ole !
As I 've already talked about some of these projects on human genome , what it can mean and the discovery of the new set of genome set .
Now we 're starting a new path : we started to digitalize biology and now now by that digital code we 're going to go into a new phase of biology , design and I 'm going to be willing .
We always tried to bring great questions .
" What is life ? " is something that many biological biologists , I think of flow them to be able to understand vary livels .
We tried different approaches , reduced to the minimum .
We 're digitalizing by almost 20 years .
When we sequenced the human genome was treated to go from analome of the world of the digital world .
Now we ask us , can we regenerate life , or create new life from this digital universe ?
This is the map of a small organism , Mycoplasma genitalium , which is the smaller genome of the smaller genome that can authorem in the lab .
And we tried to reduce the genome to create a little bit more .
We 're able to eliminate a hundred genes of about 500 that are here .
But when we give a look at his metabolic map , it 's relatively simple than our .
And we believe me , this is simple .
But when we look at all the genes that we can eliminate , one at the time , it 's very unlikely that this can bring to a living cells .
So we decided that the only way we decided to progrede was synthesize this chromosome way that we could modify the components to bring some of these fundamental questions .
And so we started the adventure of the " Can we synthesize a chromosome ? "
Can it confeeling to make these big molecules that we never have to create these big molecules that we never have to create before ?
And , in case , we can we make a cell calculus , can make a chromosome ?
A chromosome is just a piece of a piece of a chemical material .
The speed we 're able to digitalize life is growing up to the exponential .
Our capacity to write the genetic code , instead of progree , but it 's improving .
And our most recently recently the results to a curve .
We started over 15 years ago .
The process required a lot of steps , starting with a bioethical reversion before we start the first experiments .
But we found that synthesize DNA is very difficult .
There are tens of thousands of cars in the world that make small DNA segments , over the world that 's long , 30 to 50 letters and it 's a degenerative process : the most mistakes are .
So we had to develop a new method to assemble these fragments and correcrecreceive mistakes .
And this was our first attempt , to particularly digital information of the Phi 174 .
It 's a little virus that kills bacteria .
We designed the fragments , effectuated the correction of the mistakes and get a molecule of DNA .
The interesting part is when we took this piece of the chemist chemical material and we put it in the bacteria , the bacteria have started reading this genetic and to do the viral particles .
The viral particles have then been release from cells , they went back and they have been reported .
I 've been talking about recent with the oil industry from oil industry and they 're certainly understanding this model .
They have reward more than you .
We believe that this is a situation where the software can really build its same hardware in a biological system .
But we wanted to do things bigger .
We wanted to build the entire chromosome of bacteria .
They 're over 580 miles of genetic code .
So we thought we made it to build it in the size of the viruses , so we can change the cassss of a living cells .
The design is crucial , and if we start with digital information in a computer , these have to be very accurate .
When we sequenced this genome for the first time in 1995 accurats was a mistakes for every 10 miles .
We found it , you resequenced , 30 mistakes . If we used that original sequence would never be able to work .
One part of the process is design is to design a lot of 50 lettes that are underlying with all the other 50 lettes to build underneath .
We try the only only only eline .
You probably read that we read that we 're going to put in the magazine .
Think of that , we have a genetic code on four letters : An , Gs and T.
Three of those letters together , they 're going to code about 20 frightening adly 20 lacks to reading for every frightening .
So we can use the genetic code to write words , frases , thoughts .
What we 've done in the beginning is self-doing it .
Some have been dollar by the fact that it was not poem .
We designed these segments to just just a unique to only only only one with the zymes .
There are essentions that they repair them and put them on .
And we started assemble with the parts , starting with segments from five to seven milettes , unending them to get 72 miles to get 72 miles to them until they get to 72 miles to get 72 miles to get 72 miles .
Each every step we produced these segments in abundance so that we 're trying to make an extremely robustoes -- as you see in a minute .
We 're trying to automatize the process .
So , this seems like the tabellone of the basket .
When we get these very long segments , over 100 miles , they 're not going to grow more directly in the Eccles .
You get to the modern of the modern tools of molecular biology .
So we 've been considered other mechanisms .
We knew about another mechanism called a homologa , called a homologa , which is ulizes in biology to repair the DNA to be able to be able to repair the DNA .
Here 's an example .
This organism , called Deinococcus radiodurans , it can absorb three million radiation .
You can see in the superior of the danger of the drumosome .
In 12 -- 24 hours , it 's replacplaced exactly as it was before .
There are thousands of organisms that are able to do it .
These organisms can sit completely .
They can live under vacuum .
They 're absolutely certain that life exists in space , and you feel to find new rich environments of water .
ASA showed that that this is .
This is a picture of molecule that we 've built using these processes , just using the labor design of the segments .
The lights assemble leximixed .
This image is not taken with a microscope , but with a microscope , but with a microscope .
It 's a molecule we can see it with a slide that we can see it with a slide microscope .
These are pictures that cost a time of about six seconds .
This is the advertising that we 've done a little time ago .
They 're over 580,000 leckers .
It 's the largest molecule of a defined structure ever created by man .
It 's got a superior of 300 million .
If you stamsized it with a 10 without spaces , it would like 142 pages to go to transcent this genetic code .
Now , how do we work ? How do we do that ?
Of course , a virus is a game .
It 's a little bit more complicated when you use bacteria .
It 's easier as it 's as simple cell as our eucariote , you can just extract the nucleus and put another , which is basically the process of clonation .
In the bacteria , the chromosome is integrated in the cell , but we recently demonstrated that we 're able to do a complete trapipe of a cell cell of another and to activate it .
We clear a crumosome from a microbial species .
The two are different as men from the topes .
We added some gene in a lot more so that we can decide what to choose for this chromosome .
And then it 's smonstrated with the enzymes to kill all the protein .
And when we put it in the cells was amazing -- and you 'll appreciate our sophphafterwards -- the new crusticatoma -- the new cell .
And we began we thought we couldn 't go beyond , but we tried to get more beyond .
This is one of the major mechanisms of evolution .
We found that a lot of species have added a second or a third chromosome , and add in a second thousand new traits to the species .
So who think about evolution as a only gene and the time you get to it really has not understand a lot of the biology .
They 're going to be called the restription of restrition that you 're going to digerate DNA .
The chromosome that was in the cell not one .
The cellphones that we have to put it into the cell phone .
It 's expressed , and it recognized the other crumosome as exranean expressed material , and it 's been recognized with only cells and the new cell and the new cell , and the new cell .
It became blue because of the genes we put in .
And in a short lead , all the characteristics of a species , you go go lose , and it turned in a new species , based on the new software that we put in the cell .
All the proteins have changed , the membrane have changed , and when we read the equivalent of what we 've transfitted .
Now , this may seem genetic , but altering DNA software , but altering DNA software to change things in a substantial .
Now , I 've already explain that it 's not about genesesis -- but progress of progress , and I 've already told that maybe we 're going to create a new version of Cambrian explosion where they 're going to create new species of the Cambrian explosion that will be created new species on this digital process .
Why do that ?
I think it 's pretty obvious when we think about our necessities .
We 're going to go from six and a half billion people in nine 40 years .
Just to give an example : I was born in 1946 .
Now there are three people on the planet for each existent in 1946 .
We 're having problems now to find food , fresh water and clean , drug and a half billion people .
It 's going to be more hard to do it for nine billion .
We use more than five billion carbon , more than five billion carbon , more 30 billion baris .
That means a hundred million of baries a day .
When we try to find biological processes , or any kind of process to replacement , it will be a huge challenging .
We have to be deal with the whole emission of CO2 from these materials that 's going to end into the atmosphere .
At the day of today , thank you to discovery in the world , we have a database with about 20 million genes , and I like to think that are the design components for the future .
The electronics industry is only a dozen about the things , and think about how many different things are coming out .
Our limitations are principles of the reality and our imagination .
Now we have now techniques , thanks to these rapid methods of synthetization , in deal with a combine genomics .
We 're able to build a big robot that can produce a million chromosome a day .
Think about the 20 million of genes , or to try to get to get to get to get the processes to produce eightary or drugs , new vaccines , we can change , thank you to create molecular biology now in the last 20 years of science .
And it 's just a standard selection .
We can choose for a chance of survival , chemical production or carbon , production , or fuel production of ethc .
This is an instantaneous instantany software program that we 're working on to be able to be able to design and design species to computer .
Well , we don 't need to be necessarily .
We know exactly how their genetic code .
Now we 're focusing on the fuels of quarters .
You 've seen you also have to extract ethanol from the gran experiment .
We have carbons of the second and third generation that will be done by sugar to the higher of the higher value of the higher value , like the eight-different type ,
But the only way that biology can have a great impact without increasingly the cost of food and limitarly and limitaren the cost of the food and limitaren , and we think that we can have the first carbon cell that can reach this purpose , and we think we can have the first fuels of quarters in about 18 months .
The solar light with CO2 is a metodo-- but in our discovery , but in our discovery , different , we found different metods .
This is a organism that we have described in 1996 .
He lives in the deep ocean , about 2,500 meters of the deep ocean temperature of the water .
They create meter from CO2 , using hydrogen molecular as energy source .
We 're trying to figure out if we can incanalate CO2 , which can easily be transported to be transported to the CO2 in carbons , to drive this process .
So , short , we might be able to increasing what the basic question of what is the basic question , what life is . " We , real , real , we have the goal of the goal of the oil industry .
Exactly . If you don 't do that from TED , where can you ?
It would be a main of energy .
And also , we 're working for using the same metods to create vaccines .
You saw this year with influence , we 're always back to the flu and a year and with a dollar , when it 's about the right vaccine .
I think that what you can change is building combinable vaccines in antiicipate .
That 's how the future could start to look like , now , the tree of evolution , to the evolution with synthetic bacteria , and initially , arches , and initially cell eucariote .
We 're so far from improve people .
Our purpose is to do a long way of living long enough to try to do it . Thank you very much .
First of all of you can see , the most rapidly possible , some fundamental work , of the new technology that we brought to Microsoft in following a year ago . This is Seadragon .
It 's a environment that you can interact with a huge amount of visual data that remote with a huge amount of data visual data .
Here we 're seeing a lot of gigabyte of digital photographs with a kind of a zoom , and it 's a little bit , and it 's going to be able to be .
And it doesn 't matter how big it 's the amount of information that we see , how big this is the amount of data or images .
Most are common photographs , but this for example is a scanning from the Congress of Congress , and reenter in the gamel of 300 megaxy .
It doesn 't make any difference because the only thing that limits that the prestations of a system like this is the number of pixel on your screen in any time . It 's a very flexible architecture .
This is a book , for example , not of images .
This is Casa desolled of Dickens . Every colonn represented a capital .
And to show you that it 's just about it , and not images , we can do something like that , to make a real real representation of the text , not a picture .
It could be a way a little artificial to read a lot of electronic book .
You don 't know ,
This is a bigger example . It 's a number of the Loook ,
Every picture is the beginning of a sexiety .
And it really gives you the pleasure and the becomes to read the real version of a magazine or a quote , which is for a mold .
We also did something with the corner of this number in particular , of the Woman .
We have created a higher advertising ads to the higher resolution -- much more than you use in a advertising ads and we put it in the content .
If you want to see the characteristics of this automobile , you can see here .
Or other models , or even the techniques ,
And this really shows some of these ideas to eliminate the limits of space on the screen .
We hope that that means to put up to the end up with a few hoth and similar like , you don 't have to be necessary .
Of course , the map is one of the most obvious applications for this kind of technology .
And on this is not going to lose time , if we don 't say that we have contribute to give you in this field .
These are all the streets in the United States , in the United States , in the United States .
So now we go to something else .
This is now actually , it 's actually from the web ; you can go to see it .
It 's a project called Photosynth , which combine two different technology .
One is Seadragon and the other is a very interesting visual computer that 's made by Noah Snavely , a student at the University of Washington , with the aid of Steve Seitz of UW and Rick Seitz Seitz Rick Seadz . Agn a great computer .
And it 's from Seadragon , I 've been running by Seadragon .
You can see it when we do this type of screen , where we can go from one image to the other and have this kind of experience to solution .
But the space , it has a meaningful meaningful meaningful .
The algorithms of computers have been recorded these images , so that they correspond to the real places that correspond to the real places that I imagine -- all of scattack , and you know , and these things are scratch . Here we 're all sorts of things -- have been screamed . And this is that you can see the elements of a picture of a slide or a panoric show , and these things have been all of space .
I don 't know if I have time to show you some other environment .
There are a lot more space .
I want to go directly to one of the original data of Noah-- and this is from a previous prototype of Photosynthy that we 've done for the first time , I 'm going to show you what I think is really the key key to show you what I think is really the key key key to the place . And it 's not necessarily obvious , in the environments we put in the environments that we put in the website .
We had to worry about legal aspects and so on .
This is a re-construction of Notre Dame images in the Flickr . Basta digitore Notre Dame , and you get images of type , and you get images of type , and you get images of these arants in magic lead , it 's a picture that it 's discovery .
So they 're all images from Flickr and they 're all connected to the space level in this way .
And it 's possible to navigate this very simple way .
You know , I would never thought I would end up to work for Microsoft .
It 's very gratified to get this kind of acaking here .
I think you can see that it 's a lot of different type of footos . And that 's what mobile phones of the SLR , a meanative , meaningful number .
And if I can , I try and try and find out the most strange .
Many of them are stuck by faces , etc .
Some of some of the photographs -- it 's a series of photographs -- it 's a series of photographs -- it .
This is a poster of Notre Dame record .
We can go from poster to the physics of this environment .
The essential point is that we can do things with social environment . This is now taking data from the whole memory of the whole memory of how it looks like the earth , from the visual point of -- and connecting all those data .
All of those pictures become together , the major of the sum of the parts .
You have a searth of the earth that emerge .
Think about this as a prolungation of Stephen Lawler on the Earth .
It 's something that grows in complexity as as well as people use it , and the advantage to be able to get the use .
Their pictures are hushed with a meat by other people .
If you get the idea of resigning all these things , and you know , my picture of Notprint Dame suddenly , my picture of Notpractice , and I can use how to use it to be used to be like to use to the picture of it in the metaphologist and a screen .
Of course , a consequence of all this is extremely election of every interesting part of the earth , collective images , not just to live and you can 't live and you can open and similar images and similar images and similar images and similar images .
Thank you very much .
Chris Anderson : I realized what your software is going to be good ? What your software is that you have to do is that at a certain point , in the next years , all of the world are going to be practically connected to ?
BAA : Yeah . What 's doing is doing it .
It 's creating hyperlink , if you want , in the images .
And it 's doing it in the base of the images .
The thing becomes very interesting if you think about wealth of semantes of the semantes of these images .
As you do a research of images , you have a phrase and the text on the web page has a lot of information about the images of photographs .
Now , what happens if that picture you 're going to do that picture of all your pictures ?
So the amount of interconnection and the amount of wealth and the amount of wealth is really huge . It 's a classic effect of the network .
CA : Well , it 's really amazing . Compliments .
BAA : Thank you very much .
One of the main pleasure when you travel and one of the ethnographics of the ethnographics , it 's going to live in the wind , you hold the past in the wind , you touch the past in the wind , you touch in the wind , it 's going to leverage to the plants .
Bastes thinking that the scientists Jaguar vision still beyond the Via Lattea , or the Mititites of Inuit 's still meaning , or Himalayas , the buddists still the respire of the Dharmful , but to remind the central importance of the anthropology , and that the idea that the central world , but it 's only a model , but it 's just a model of reality , but it 's just a model ,
the consequence of a particular adaptative choices that our estrpe has done , well , many generations ago .
And , of course , we all share of essential tracs .
Everybody is going to try .
We 're subjects to start .
We have to deal with the inexorability of death , so we don 't surprise if we 're going to go and we 're --
We all have a art .
What it 's the particular rhythm of the song , the rhythm of the dance of every culture .
It doesn 't matter that matter that 's the Penan Irawinds of the Borneo , or the following Vodoo 's the Currers , or the desert Kaisut 's Curch in Kenya , or a cammelliptical cammers .
He was my companies my journey in the desert a month ago , or a houses of Keep , the valles of the world .
All of these people teaching us that there are other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , other ways of moving in the world .
And , if you think , you think , it 's a concept that it can give you hope .
And with the myriries , the myries of the world create a ragnote of spiritual life and cultural , which is important for the well-being of the planet and it 's important for the well-being of the planet as a biosphere .
And you can think about this cultural ragnonosphere and you can defined the extraordinary ethnosphere , all the concepts , dreams , and ideas , intuitions , intuitions , ideas , intuitions , intuitions , intuitions ,
The etnosphere is the fantastic fantastic patriage of humanity .
It 's the symbol of what we 're and what we can be in how much inquisitive .
And because the biosphere was gravly consumed as it has been very much consumed to the ethnosphere and very quickly .
No biological , for example , it would say that 50 percent of all species is , or is on the orderness of the extinction just because it 's fake , or -- in the most airplanetetetc .
The index of all of that is , of course , the language loss .
When you 're born 6,000 languages on this planet .
One language is not only composal by a vocabulary or a series of rules .
One language is the human spirit .
It 's the half of the animal is that the animal of every culture comes in the material world .
Every language is a forest , a forest of mind , a backin , a thought , a very ecosystem of the spiritual .
And of those 6,000 languages , as we 're here in Monterey , at least half the half of the children .
They 're not teaching kids , which means , unless you 're going to be trust to say , unless we 're going to be .
What is there 's more sad than being aved by the silence , of being the last to talk about a language , the way of transmit to the wisdom of the children ?
This is horrating was a few weeks of the world every two weeks : every two weeks a old one weeks : every two weeks a old language and door , with an an antic language .
And I know somebody of you say , " Don 't it 's much better ?
The world would not be a better place if we talk to you all the same language ? " Well , then we talk about yoruba . So , let 's talk about the dotonese .
We talk about kogs .
You 'll be a tracks of a tracks , what 's going to be able to talk about your language .
I 'd like to like to do a journey through the etnosphere --
a little journey in the ethnosphere to give you a murder of what we 're losing .
Many of us forget that when I say , " different ways of exists , " I mean , " I mean , " I mean , " I mean , " I mean , " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " A different ways of existing , "
We take for example this Barasana Barasana , in Amazon Amazon , and the anacond people , who believe the anacond of the west sat of the west saconeest in the west panel ,
It 's a popular people that 's not able to distinguess the blue color from the green blue , because you 're identified in the forest , which depends on the population .
They have a strange language and a matrimonial rule , called " exogamia . "
That 's all radical has been in the past mitologic , yet the particularity is that in these families , and they 're talking about six or seven languages because of matrimons no one language .
They 're going to listen to and then they start to talk .
We take one of the most interesting tribes I lived , Waorans of Ecuador nural , an incredible popular popular people had the first contacts in 1958 .
In 1957 , five missionaries have tried a conduct in 1957 ,
They did taken off the photographs that they would return them into a lot of reported , they would return that this population of the pluvial forest had never seen anything bi-dimensional .
They collected the picture of the earth , they spend it to the research of a shape or a shape , and they 've finding the hell , and they kill the five missionaries with the lance .
But Waorani don 't kill the southern .
They kill in their own .
54 percent of mortality was caused by their same .
We 're going to eight generations and we found two of natural death and we found two natural death and when we 've been reached , they admit that one of them was invecently so they had died , and then they kill it killed it .
The hunters were able to recognize the animal from 40 steps and recognize the species .
In the early ' 80s , I 've been assigned a very interesting task when my Harvard professor asked me if I wanted to go to Harvard to the base of Duvalier and Tonton Macoutes , and Tonton Macoutes and Tonton Macoutes and Tonton Macoutes and Tonton the bottom of the fast ,
To give a sense of miraculous , I should have to understand the Vodoo culture , and the Vodoo not be magic .
It 's quite a complex , metapphysics of the world .
Many interesting .
If I ask you to tell the great religions of the world , what would you say ?
Cristianesimum , Islam , Buddhic , Ebraism , Ebraism , etc .
A continent is always left out , thinking that Africa has no religious feeds . And it 's yes and Vodoo and Vodoo and Vodoo or is not the distilside of these religious concepts in the tragic tragic concepts of slavery .
What 's interesting to voodoor is the intended between life and death .
So the vision they hid the spirits .
The spirits can be invoced by the Great Acqua , they response to the rhythm of the dance and they replaced the way that for a short short , that 's a short thing becomes the dio .
So , the voodoost , they love to say , " You white go to the God .
We say in the time and we 're dead and we 're God . "
And from the moment you 're rid , is the spirit that you 're driving , how do you get bad ?
So you 're at these incredible events : follow vote in the state of trance , and you 're going to take a very stronger demonstration of the power of mind when it 's catalyzed in a state of extreme ,
And all the people who have been visited the most extraordinary Kogi of Sierra Nevada , in the Sierra Nevada , in the Santa Marta , in the Santa Marta .
It was deep of the ancient civilization that once they were living on the caraibits of the Colombia in the conquicte , the popular popular of the vulcanic major , and the people would herge on the vulcanic plants .
In a continent macchieved , this popular is never conquisted by the Spanish .
But they 're governmented by a clero , but their formation is very extraordinary .
The young people following the people are taken away from the families to three or four years , and live in a world , and share in a world of pieces and share in the bottom of the ice for 18 years .
Two doughly nine years of propositions to reproduce the nine months of the gesture that transformed in the user of the mother , they 're now metaphor in the Grande of Mfather .
And so , in the time , they 're acculturate to the values of their society , values that preglaciers and only their prayer and just their prayer , or to say the cost of ecological balance .
At the term of this incredible began , they 're suddenly landed out and the first time in their 18 years , they see a day-aawareness , when the sun the value of the first bloose , everything that has learned in theory is that it has been learned in theory is that it 's confersed in all his splendor . The predict a step does a pass . And the predict a step does a pass pass . And the first time it does it go back and he remain theory .
" Have ? Right ? I said , " I said .
It 's amazing . Now it 's about you protect it . "
They call greater greater and they say that we , brothers , brothers , we are the collipaign of the world .
This level of intuition is extremely important .
When we think about the invoice of the Rousau and the old history of the noble noble , which is a razer concept , which is a razer , which is a razer , in his simplicity or maybe we 're neighbors to the Earth of us .
The Ingenes are not no fefefeelings , no indebolites from nostalggate .
There 's no space for these things in the malarial palual palators or the gelids of the Tibet , but thank you to the time and I , have created a mystics of the Earth 's not about an esserne consciously much neighbor , but on a very much more sot-a-, the concept that the Earth can only live infused by human consciousness .
What does it mean ?
It means a little bit of the Ande who grows up to believe that the mountain is a little bit of a wish wish , which is going to be human being deeply different , and it 's going to have a very different relationship to the mountain that place to a little bit more than a boy of Montana who grow up a massive mass-rocks that a mountain mass is a mass-main of rocks .
which is the demadly of a spirit or a mineral cutter is irrelevant .
What 's interesting is metaphor that defines the relationship between the individual and the natural world .
I grew up in the forests of the Columbia credden that would provide the forests to be cut .
That has made me a human being different from my friends Kwakiuts that believe the Hukuk 's dimora of the Hukuk and the batch of the paradise and the ball of the world , the spirits that are going to live in the world , spiriters that they 're going to deal with the Hamasa began .
If you start considering that these cultures can create reality , you can start to understand some of the sensional purpose .
I 've taken this picture to open up in the nordoctor in the nordoccctor .
Mayahuash , some of you have heard about the ayahuash , the most powerful psycoat of the monstrate repertoire .
What makes it fascinating the ayahuash is not the macological potential of the substance of the substance , but his election . It 's composal by two elaboration .
On the side , this lian lian lian lian X-carboline , harmful and harmful , harmolines , slightly hallucinogene .
And I 'm going to do the only plant , you have a bluid bluid that altera little bit about the consciousness , but it 's a bluid of the coffee of the coffee of the coffee of the coffee of the coffee of the coffee .
This plant has tripptamines , very similar to serotonin , dimethylptamine-5 , methoxt-pamin-hypamine .
If you ever see the Yanomami , you 'll see the Yanomami , the substance that they do a different set of species , sort of , you know , methoxt-ypamine .
And I think about the dust of the nose is a little bit like being disappeared by a card of painhold , and landing on a sea of electricity . [ Risated not creates a distorsion of reality ; it 's creates the reality of reality .
I was often a lot of my professor , Richard Evan Shultes , the man who has been psychedelical , with his discovery , with his discovery , and his discovery of the fungi of the fabinherent , in Mexico .
I think my tesis , you can 't class these tripptamines like hallucinated because if you 're done , you can 't tell anyone to be hallucinated .
It 's possible to be at the horally only if you get them to the other than than the MAO .
Now it 's the beautiful : the carboline that are the cool of MAr , the same type of inhores , the same type of indeed , the type of the same type of the same type of things , like these people are doing , like these people who are in a lot of 80,000 species , like these people who are two deales , but if you combine in this way , they make a biochemical version that 's daim , they make a biochemic .
We use the great eupherd of the proof of the proof and mistake , which can reveal infrufer .
But if we ask the Indians , they 'll tell us , " The plants are talking about . "
What does it mean ?
This tribes , the Cofan , has 17 varieties of ayahuasks , which are neply in the forest , and that we would remain our eyes would remain the forest .
If you ask them , if they ask them , how they 're going to tell us , " I was going to tell you about it , and the rest of the rest of the rest , and I said , " No . "
The solution is : you take the 17 variety of a sunnight , and each one will downnn-and-up .
With this is not in Harvard , but it 's much more interesting than to count the stage .
Now , [ applaushes the problem is that even the ones of us that have to heart popular ingenes , they find them peareas , but somehow reducts to the margins of the history of our real world , and pass .
In fact , the 20th century , it 's not going to remind to his drives or innovations , but as the world 's what we 're stopped and the kind of a lot of active diversity or the world . Now the problem is not the change .
All cultures through the centuries have been involved in a dance for new possibility of life .
And the problem is not technology .
The Indians Sioux have no stopped to be Sioux when they put up to the arc and they 're like Americans don 't have been stopped by horal and calute .
It 's not the change or technology that threats the integrity of the ethnosphere . It 's the power .
The flight flight of domination .
And if you give a look at the world , you 'll find that these are not destinated cultures that these are not destiny .
They 're living and living dynamics and spint outside the existence of the forces of the adaptation of adaptation .
I don 't have to disboscaming in the Penan Penan --
a popular nobble , in the waste Sarest est est , a popular popular , a popular popular , and now reduced to a generation ago , and now reduced to the servitus , where you can see the river of the river 's physics , where you can see the river of the lim that it seems to be able to bring up to the horizon , where the Japanese Merian horizon , where the gonds ,
With the wood stands with the forest dreds with the subtracks .
Or , in the case of the Yanomami , are the disease that have come with the pursuit of the gold .
If we move on on the mountains of Tibet , where I 'm doing a lot of research , you 'll see the hard flight flight .
As a genocide , the physics of a popular popular , is a universal level , but the width of a population , but the destruction of a population , not only is convicted , but advance of the development of certs , because it 's a part of the development of the development of the development .
And you can 't understand the suffering of Tibet until you go from the beginning .
I 've been going to 6,000 miles from Chengdu in Chengdu , through Tibet sudden , coming in Lhasa young colleague , but only arrived in Lhasa young colleague , but only arrived in Lhasa , I realized what we feel about .
6,000 sacres reducts in the dust and fall .
1.2 million people killed by the military military during the Cultural Rivolution .
The father of this guy was ascritical at Panchen Lama .
The Chinese is that killed in the Chinese invasion .
His , he was worse with Santity in Santity , in the diaspora that 's popular in Nepal .
His mother was imprigioned and his colpe was recil .
It was brought to the age of two years of the age of two years hidden under his gonna . It could have to live without him .
The sister , which did the same , it was put in reduced reducation .
A day he put into a day , he put a coffigurant , and for this transgression , it was put on the transgression , it was put on the work for seven years .
The Tibet of Tibet is to be unoverwheleel , but the recenter of the people is to be inspirit .
At the end , everything is reduce to a choice .
We want to live in the world in the monoden world , or we want to accooking the pollen world ?
The great anthropologists Margaret Mead , before he died that his bigger was that , in our way to this frightening view of the world , not only we 'll see the whole gama of human imagination reduced to a limitate the human imagination , but one day we 're going to see from a sleep ,
And it 's umillion years , it 's about 60,000 years .
The Neolitics Rivolution , which has gives us agriculture , which has done us subsign us , and they 're going to fight us to the seed of the clay , creating the hierarchy of specialization , and we talk about 10,000 years ago .
The industrialized world has 300 years .
And that 's a story , I 'm not suggests that we have the answers to the challenges that we 're going to have to deal with the millennia to come .
When you get these myriades of the world is asked what it means to be human , they response with 10,000 different voices .
And it 's in these answers that we all have the chance to be what we 're , a conscious species , which has to make all the people and all the gardens can fighting all the gardens can fighting .
I went to this picture of the northern extremity of Baffin the island of the Baffin , when I went to the waste of the Inuit , Olayas , and he told me the wonderful story of his grandfather .
The downnstage government has not always been given to the Inuit and in the ' 50s to stabilish , we have to requused to them in colonies .
The grandfather of this man refuted to go .
Hunry , I teming her life , I 'll take it away all the golden , and all his hots .
You have to know that Inuit , they don 't temon the freeze , they disappear .
The pattins of slitters in origin were made of the skin of pain .
The grandfather of this man had not intimight from the night or the library of the library , which was suffering .
It 's sgattaiolder , you 've calculated the pantalone in the skin and their hand . When the fecked them , they 've got it , they 're working on a lama .
He sprubbed salive on the points of this hell of caccine and when it became solid , he kill a dog .
He took the dog and created a brighter , with the haunt cass has created a slete , he made a sleep , and he imbridge to the bone , hell of the hell , he 's hell in the remain .
We want to talk about cavarself-resilience with anything ? [ Risate . And this , in different ways , [ Applausi is the symbol of the resilience of the world .
In the april of the California government redded the total control of a larger territory of a bigger territory of California and Texas mitted .
It 's the new patria . It 's called Nunavut .
It 's a very independent territory . They all about the mineraries .
One splendid of how a natione-state can rererecognize with his population .
And , finally , I think it 's quite obvious at least who we have been in these remote places of the planet , you realize that they 're not remote .
For somebody 's home is home .
They represented severtions of human imagination that are going to get the dress of the children , as the dreams of these children , as the dreams of our children , become part of the hope .
First , we have National Geographic , we convinced that political will never get nothing .
We believe the polemic --
[ Applausi , they 're not persuasive , but we believe that stories can change the world , and maybe we 're the best institution to tell the stories of the world . Every month of our website . Every month of a .
156 countries transmit our television dog .
Our rivers are letters from millions of people .
Our work is traveling in the ethnosphere to bring our audience in the places that will go through the main of the world that will go through as they 've seen and , you hope , above , they will hold the central reveal of the central anthropology : the world of exists in the diversity , and we have to find a life in a plural world of plural and multicultural world 's life in a plural world , and we have to find a life in a life in a life of life ,
where all the people can contributing to our collective well-being collective well-being .
Thank you .
I 'm going to talk about some things that I wrote in this book that I hope you 've heard and I 'm going to try to prove some of the connections , in case you don 't see them .
I 'd like to start with what I call the " official dogma official dogma .
The official dogma 's worth of what ?
The official dogma of all the Western industrial society . The official dogma 's recenticial , " If we want to massive to do it is to massive to do it is to massive freedom . "
The reason is , from one side , in fact that freedom is in itself a value , is ues , useful , essential for human beings .
Of the other is that if we 're free , each of us can act for all of us can act for doing everything that massimilar of our well-being , without no one that we 're going to be .
The way to massimilar freedom is massive to be massive to be the choice .
Or choices are more than people have , more free , and more than they are the freedom , more than they are .
This , I think , it 's so deeply radical in the society that nobody would dreams to put it in doubt .
And it 's also deeply radical in our lives .
I 'm going to show you some examples of what progress has made possible .
This is my supermarket . It 's not particularly big .
I lose a simple note about the inhall of the inhall .
In my supermarket , there are 175 , no matter of the 10th of the extraverage , and 12 aceters and 12 aceters and 12 aceters that you can buy for a number of condition , in the inceptioning of the 175 of the room that nobody of the 175 pronaight ,
Here 's how the supermarket .
Then you go to the store of electronic store : CD leck , radio , MD lettore , radio , piahand , the lower .
And in this single store of electronic store , there 's a great number of components .
We can do six and a half million different combinations , using the components that there are in one store .
You need to admit that there 's a lot of choice .
Other fields : the world of communications .
Once , when I was a child , you could get all the telephone services , and they were fornites from mom .
You had the phone , you didn 't buy it .
A consequence of that , in the other , was that the telephone never break .
These days are going .
Now we have a variety of telephones , especially between mobile phones .
Here 's the cell phones .
My favorite is that in the middle , MP3 , cut out of the nose , and housea .
If you don 't have seen it in the store under the house , you 're going to get to the end .
And what happens is that people come in in the gods and it 's going on , and it 's what 's the answer is " No . "
It 's not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn 't do too much .
So , in other things that are much more important than the acquired of the acquired , you know , the same choice .
Axistence : no more in the United States that you go from the doctor and the doctor and the doctor you say what you do .
Instead , you go to the doctor , and the doctor says , " OK , we might do A , or B . " Ages , " Again , " Are you going to do ? "
You say , " Dotore , what should I do ? "
And the doctor says , " A has these benefits and these risks , B has these benefits and risks . "
What do you want to do ? "
And you rebits : " Dotore if she was me , what would you do ? "
And the doctor : " But I 'm not her . "
The result of the result of the mality of mality , " expression that makes it look like a beautiful thing .
But it 's actually not that one to move the weight and responsibility to make decisions by somebody who knows something , which is , oxiety , and almost certainly , it 's not about -- and so not in the ideal condition to make the patient decisions .
There 's a huge marketing of products , drugs like me and you , that if you think of it has no sense , because if you think of it has no sense , because we can 't buy them .
But if we can 't buy them , why do they have public ?
The answer is that they want to domorning , we call the doctor to ask them to be recipe .
And what 's fundamental identity is our horever is a question of choice , as you see in this reach , " We don 't want to force the children . We don 't want to prove the right time . " We don 't need to invent .
And we can reinvented how many times we can make it .
That means that every morning , you have to decide that kind of person is .
I 've been to get the family and marriage , a time the common perspective , unhappy , and it was that you were married to the most soon possible , and you begin to get the most price possible .
The only real choice was with who , not when you 're even going to do .
Ose , it 's really to play .
I teach students very smart , and I do 20 percent in less than a time .
And it 's not because they 're brilligent , not because they 're good .
but why are they impensieritous , I 'm going to say , " Would I marriried or not ? Would I be able to do it right now ? "
" Would I marrirightly to be marrirightly later ? "
They 're interrogatives of logic .
And they 're trying to answer these questions , even if this implesson , even though it 's not to get a beautiful vote to my exame .
And they have to do it . They 're important .
Now , the work : we 're lucky , as the subststage , because technology allows us to work every minute , every day , from every corner of the planet , except that from Hotel Randolph .
And in the parentesis , there 's a corner , and I 'm not going to tell anyone , where the WiFi works .
I 'm not saying , because I want to use it .
What does this mean , this amazing freedom of choice that we have to do it ? It 's to continue , if we have to work or not .
We can go to see our son playing hot , with the mobile phone , the mobile phone , Blackberry in the other , and the notebook , typically , on the gock .
And even though they 're all spent , every minute that we see our child doughly to be asking , " I 'm going to answer to this call ? "
" Do I answer to this email ? "
And even when the answer is " no , " no , " all this makes the experience of your child 's game of your child 's party to be in other conditions .
So , from any part of the things , and big , materials and large materials and life , life is a question of choice .
Once the world was this : Ovreal , there were some possibilities , but it was not a question of choice .
The world of today is a good thing , the dilemma is : " It 's a positive thing , or negative ? "
The answer is South .
The positive laten laten , we all talk about the negative lats .
That 's all this choice , two effects of the people .
The first , paradoxally , it 's produced by paradoxally , it 's produced by paradoxts .
With a lot of options between which choose to choose , it becomes very difficult to do it .
I give you an example : a meaningful study of flying flight .
A connects has been access to the Vanguard data , the gigantic society , the source of a million clients of pouring clients in 2,000 different companies .
What she found is that for every 10 solutions that are offerte in more , the percentage of the adesion of two percent .
With 50 offer-fund source , there 's 10 percent in less than adhhesions than only five .
Because with 50 fourds in 50 fources between which to choice , it 's maledtly decide , and choice is sent to be sent to be sent .
And I wonder , and I still wonder , tomorrow , and I wonder , and of course , and it 's not going to be .
You know , it doesn 't mean that only these work from old work from old , because they don 't have enough money , even want to say that the decision is so hostics that allow the function of the work .
I 'm not participating , they 're losing until five dollars a year from the work , which would be well disposed to be true .
So the paralysis a consequence of having too much choices .
And I think that makes the world like that .
" And finally , for ethchetchup , hetchup , or maion or maion ? "
You 'd like to take the right decision , if it 's for the ethernity , right ?
You don 't want to choose the wrong bottom , and you don 't want to choose to the wrong condition .
So this is the first effect . The second is that we can also evootherwise and do a choice , at the end we 're less to be options of how we 're going to be with less options between which to choose .
And that 's a lot of reasons .
One of these is that with a lot of condition , which choose , if you buy one and not perfect , it 's not easy to imagine that you would have been better . And what happens is that the alternative imaginative , you know , it 's the alternative imagination , and the replacement of choice , and the replacement of choice , and the replacement of the replacement of the choice , and the repair the result of the choice that you would have been better .
even when it was a good decision .
Or choice , there 's more easy to displepleasure than any detail that 's unsody-like choice .
And also , there 's what economists call expensive opportunities .
Dan Gilbert has close very well stamattine as the value that we do things depends on what we 're confronted .
Of rest , when there are so many options , it 's easy to representing the characteristics of the paper and be less to be disfacts of the option that you have been choice .
Here 's an example . I 've all been a lot of the people who are not New York .
But that 's what you would probably think of .
There 's this copy of the Hamptons .
A lussign .
It 's samp pushed . Otma day . It 's all about them .
Not nothing . But what he thinks is , " Well , sick , sick . "
" Everybody 's my neighbors in Manhattan are away . "
" I could talk about it right in front of the house . "
And it 's going to go to the idea that 's loss -- every day -- the possibility of parking , where it wants .
The consto-opportunity decrease the soddisfair for what we have , when choice was excellent .
And the more are the options that we have to look at , more the characteristics will come back to how expensive it 's going to be .
Here 's another example .
This is a lot of things .
It 's about living the moment , and maybe in the living lenty .
But the most important point is that you want to do , you go to do not do the other .
The things that we don 't choose to be a lot of attractive that can make less attractive what we do .
Third point : spiral of the growing of expectations .
I tried it on my skin buying a new couple of jeans .
I 'm almost always jeans .
Onnce the jeans were just like , buy , and they were weared , and they were uncommodly , just after they had a life and work , and they were a lot of times , they started going to go well .
So , I went to buy a couple of new when the old were going , and I said , " I need a couple of jeans , this is my cut . "
The committed commit said , " Look , " Do you want to do it ? "
Do you want to do it with the certainer or the bottons ? " Stoneboy , " or " acidgae " ? "
" Look , " Do you know , " Look ? "
" Hunk , you want to leave them or stretch ? Bil -- " Continured to elenhoods .
I was sbalord , and after a little bit , I could say , " I want to say , " I want to know what it was , so for a little bit of a time I tried to all the jeans , and then I went out from the store , I 'm going to get a little bit of jeans that I ever had .
It was the massixm . With all that choice I had the best .
But I felt I was worse .
Why ? I wrote a whole book to understand it .
The reason I was worse to it 's worse , with all that choice of my expectations were very much , the jeans had to be perfect .
I was beginning I had expectations . I didn 't expect to do anything exceptional , when there was 100 different , steps , at least one guy had to be perfect .
What I was good at it was , but not perfect .
After I had to talk about that I was going to try to do what I was trying to do is uncomfortable in front of the expectations .
The add of options in life , not to increase the life that they have to increase the excellence of the same .
And this will proof less soddisfation , even when the results are good .
No one in the world of marketing if you realize .
Because if they knew it , you wouldn 't know what I 'm talking about .
The truth looks more like this .
" You better , when it was worse . " The reason he was better when he was worse was even worse is that when he was worse to meet of pleasure .
Ose , in the world that we live in -- opulents , industrialized citizen , industry with the expection of the performation -- the massive that we can hope is that things that we can hope is that things to the altitude of expectations .
You never have surprised pleasure because your expectations , my expectations , you 're ungant .
The secret of happiness -- what you 're here -- is , " Bases . "
I mean -- small , autobiography -- which I 'm really married and my wife is really amazing .
I couldn 't do better , I couldn 't do it , I 'm not acked .
But it 's not always a bad thing .
Finally , a consequence of buy a couple of jeans when there 's only that kind of jeans is that when you 're in a disfacts , and you know , " Why ? "
" Who is responsible ? " , the answer is close .
The world is responsible . What can I do you ?
When you get hundreds of kinds of jeans , and buy a insody-bought , and you ask who 's the responsible , it 's as clear that responsible you .
You could do better .
With hundreds of varieties available , there are no use for insuccess .
So when people take decisions , even if the results is valid , they feel insoddisdissatic , they 're going to be disrupon .
In the last years , the depression is explosion in the industrialized world .
I think a factor of a significant factor -- not the only one , but important -- of this wave is that people have some dolleness experiences because standard experiences are too high .
And when they have to explain this situation they think that the colpe is they think they 're going to be .
So the final result is that we 're in general , objectively , but we feel worse .
Let 's remember you .
This is the official dogma , what we all take for good and it 's completely fly . It 's not true .
There 's no doubt that a little bit of choice is better than to have no matter , but it 's not going to be a little bit of choice is better than a little bit .
There 's a critical value , I don 't know what it 's .
But I 'm sure we 've been supposed to be done by a piece of the level where they 're getting better .
Now , from political point of view -- I 've been almost finished -- from political point , the noccction is the following .
What allows this to be choice in the industrial society is the wealth .
There are a lot of places in the world , and you know , where the problem is not that they have to be too much choice .
The problem is that they have too few .
So the factory I 'm talking about is a mal-being exclusive to be exclusive , recic society .
And what it does depress and climbs this : Steve Levitt Levitt has been talking about how much those and the pursues of the web and unuseful ways . It 's a sprehold of money .
I mean , these choices , complicated and available , it 's not that they 're useful .
They 're a dolphin .
They 're worse .
If a little bit of what in our society is going to lows a little choice was reversed in those where people have too few possibilities , it would not only have their life to better . But our own life .
That 's what economists call a parts improve improvement .
A redistribution of the income redistributtion , not only to poor -- because of this choice in excess that we get us .
And to end up , " Filillness , you can get everything you want . "
You , people of culture , you 're thinking , " But what does it create fish ? "
" It 's obvious that you can 't make anything in a glass . "
An imagine castrated , a limited view of the world --
and I 'm going to get it so , at the beginning .
But then , I 'm realizing , instead , I realized that that it 's the long way .
Because the reality of the facts is that if you send it 's actually , as you can 't get freedom . You get the paralth . You get the paralysis .
If you break the bocting , you break the ddisfall of decreating .
You get the paralysis , and you 'll reduce the well-being .
Everybody need a sphere .
This is almost certainly too tremendous , perhaps even for the fish , and certainly for us .
But the above of some symbolic symbolic sphere is a recipe for childhood .
Thank you very much of heart .
