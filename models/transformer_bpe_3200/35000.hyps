I 've shown these slides to show that the arccalotter 's glacial calott , which for almost three million years has had the size of 48 million years had the size of 48 percent .
But this underlying gravity of the problem because it doesn 't show the score of the ice .
The Atical calotter is , in a way , the clear heart of the global climate system .
It expands up to winter and you ritiate .
The next slide will be a quick , you know , the next slide the last 25 years .
The lobe of the glacen , they 've been signed in red .
As you see , they expand until blue .
That 's the ice in winter , which is ritions of summer .
You can see that the cosident ice , five years or more , is like blood , which is like blood , which here was from the body .
In 25 years , it 's past it .
This is a problem because the heat at at the ground . That 's the glacier around the ocean where there are huge carbon carbon congle where there are huge carbon carbon dioxy-metane .
To the totality of the atmospheric pollution , that amount could double-down , super-scale .
In some little deep in Alaska the metan is already rebolding from water .
The professority Walter of Alaska University of Alaska was a by-based bottom .
Video : Wow ! Al Gore : You 're good . The question is if we 're also .
A reason that this is the termal snorts of Groenland from the north .
This is a river in the glacial regime .
He had never reached to levels .
This is the Kangerlussuaq , in the southwest of the Groenland .
If you want to know how the sea level of the sea for the melting of the glacen on the ground , here is where the sea .
These currents are increasing rapidly .
Anowhere part of the planet : Antarctica , the largest block of the planet .
The last month , the scientists have dichieve that the ice of the ice is in negative , and the Western Antarctica , who pogen on some submarine islands , is particularly rapid in the month .
It 's about six feet of the water water water , like Groenland .
Sulil Himalayas , the third largely block of ice , you see new laghi , which few years ago , they were glaciers .
Forth percent of the world population is rich half the water from that melting melting .
Sulle Ande : this glacier is the source of this city .
The loud is increased .
But when you decrease , the same happens to the water .
In California , the nenow on Sierra Nevada is decreased 40 percent .
The idricers are in crisis in crisis .
The predictions , as you read , are great .
The growth safity in the world leads to a cross-fire .
The environmental disasters are increasing out of the normal and unprecedented .
Four times more numheroes in the last 30 years than previous previous 75 .
This is a whole thing that is insustainable .
If you look at it in the context if you can see the context .
We 've added 70 million tons of CO2 , every 24 hours -- 25 million tons of the ocean every day .
Look at the Eastern area of the Eastern Pacific , to the west , to the west , and on both parts of the Indian underpoints of oxygen in the ocean .
The major cause of global warming , together to deforestation , which is the 20 percent of them , is the fossil fuel use of cool fuel .
On the oil is a lot of the problem is even worse .
The United States are one of the two countries with the most emissions , together to China .
And it proposed to build a lot of other carbon clump core .
But we 're seeing a way of the way of the way .
These are annowledge projects over the last few years and some proposals of alternative alternative .
And at the way , there 's a political fight in our country .
The coal and the oil industry have spent 250 million dollars in the last year to promote carbon , which is a oxygggggggggggle .
That image , he reminded me something --
Natale Verice in the Tennessee , where I live , there was a loss of 3.8 billion liliters of carbon dioxide .
You may have seen it on news .
This is the second largest flow of last America .
It happened around Natale .
The Nortaliice of one of the carbon industry was this .
Video : Still . â™« Frosty the carbon is a very , and happy .
It 's abundant here in America , and it grow our economy .
Frosty coality is increasingly clean .
It 's good price , adorable and the work keep the stypend .
Al Gore : So , here 's a lot of the West Virginia .
The largest mineral society on the mountains is Massey Coal . This is his administrator .
Video : Don Blankenship : I 'm going to have a clear -- Al Gore , Nancy Pelous , Harry Reid -- they don 't know what they 're talking about .
Al Gore : So the Alleance for the Clima has launched two campaign two campaigns .
This is a thing .
Video : Acore : Acore : ALergy , we see climate change climate change as a sery sery to our business .
So , our priority is to invest a large amount of money in a effort to make public and confused in order to make public and confused it to make a fuel .
In fact , carbon is not spending .
We think it 's clean -- it 's also a good profuel .
So not preocumatic of climate change .
Let 's do it to us .
Video : Chilit : Carian -- you heard a lot of it .
So let 's make a turn into a structure at the horry about the puly-list .
Straining ! The machines are a little noisy , but this is the sound of coal technology .
The coal consume is between the main of global warming , but the remarkable technology that you see changes everything .
Do a look : this is the puly-carbon technology .
Al Gore : Indeed , the positive alternative conducts to the economic issue and the national security .
Video : The economy , the economy , the economy , the national security , climate crisis .
The file that connects all : our dependence from fossil fuel combustible , like coal and oil oil .
Now , but , there 's a new , audace solution to use circles .
Repower : 100 percent of the clean energy in 10 years .
A plan to put America to work to work , make us sure more , and help to stop the global warming .
Finally , a solution that dying our problems .
Repower . It 's more .
Al Gore : This is the last .
Video : It 's about to reach energy to America .
One of the fastest ways to bring dependence from the combustible dependence that kill our planet .
So , I 'm going to get here . Five , a new energy network .
Novi : Novi investment for two , very well retribes .
To : Repower . It 's time to be realists .
Al Gore : A old proverbio African says , " If you want to go fast , you go to fast .
If you want to go away , you go together . "
We need to go away , fast .
Thank you very much .
LHC last year at TED , I introduction on the LHC .
And promise to get around to get around you about how the machine works .
So , here I 'm here . And for the ones that the other time there were no , LHC is the largest scientific experiment I 've ever tried -- 27 kilometers of circles .
His task is to rereflare conditions less than a billion times from the beginning of the universe -- until 600 million times per second .
That 's just ambicycle .
This is the machine under Ginevra .
We 're going to do these min-Big Bang inside the detectors .
This is what it 's working on . It 's called ATLAS -- large-foot diameter of 22 meters .
This is an ATLAS picture picture of ATLAS in construction so you can see proportions .
Ten september last year we 've accesum the machine for the first time .
And this picture was taken by ATLAS .
It was because of immense festeggams in the control room .
It 's an image of the first fascination that had done all the other of the LHC , entering in collision , with a part of the LHC , and spread particles inside the detector .
In other words , when we saw that image 10 september , we realized that machine was a great writing .
I don 't know if it was going to exultate more or this , when somebody went to Google and saw the page was this .
That means we 've had a cultural impact beyond .
About a week later , there was a problem with the machine , just had to these files here -- these files .
These are 13,000 amping when the machine works when the machine works at the massive power .
Now , the technicians are going to look at the file and say , " That 's not true . They 're not really slow too subtle . "
And they can do it because when they 're very covering the super----------------file .
So , at least 271 degrees , at least 271 degrees to that the current of space between stars , these are able to bring that current .
In one of the junture of the magneti magneti magneti in the LHC , there was a defect of fit .
So the file climb , and the 13,000 amping suddenly meeting a meant .
This was the result .
Now , this is even more impressive if you think that these magneti fish more than 20 tons , and that 's moved about 30 centimeters .
They were in about 50 magnets .
We had to take them , what we did .
We restinated them and upon it .
They 're now going back to all the subland to their underground .
By the end of march the LHC will be again .
We 're going to access it , and we expect to get data or June , and we keep that we keep the morning to find out what are the morons that are the morons that are the universe .
Now , of course , in a certain way , these accidents reached the debate on the value of science and engineering in front . It 's easy to convict . It 's easy to conviction .
I think the fact that it 's so hard , the fact that I think it 's the value of things like LHC .
I want to end with the words of a English scientist , Humphrey Davy , which , I imagine , in defense of the income experiments of his pulle , his pulle was Michael Farads , said , " Nient is so dangerous to the progress of the human mind of the the human mind of the way the the renhriting of the human mind that are defined , that there are no initial , that we 're not in nature ,
Thank you .
I want to start to ask you about thinking when , as a kids , you played cover in the morning .
As you get to get them and get them to get them and get them , and get them to move them , and you learn , you know , you know , and you can actually do the space relationship .
The space reasoning is deeply connected to the way we understand a lot of the world around us .
So , from the inspiring of our interaction with physical objects , together to my physical objects , together to my Pactor , and my collaborator Jeevan Kalanithi , I started to ask me , " And if we use a computer , instead of having the only cursor of the mouse like polypyroyer that moves on on a desktop , we could deal with both both your hands ,
and how do it to our please ?
The question was so interesting that we decided to explore the answer , building Siftable .
In a few words , a Siftable computer is a computer interactive .
In a few words , a Siftable computer is a computer interactive .
You can move with her hand , they can see them , they can hear their movement and they have a screen and a radio wireless .
But most of course , are physical objects , like the morning , you can move to cross-randle .
The Siftable is the example of a new ecosystem of tools to manipulate digital information .
And as they become more physical , aware of the movement , of the other , and as they become more physical , the other , of how we die them , we can explore new and fun and fun and fun and fun and fun and fun and fun and fun and interaction .
I 'm going to start with some simple example .
This Siftable is configurated to show video : if you can stop it in a direction , the video rotable , the video rotable .
These interactive portraits are aware of the other .
If I ran them , they 're interested what they 're around .
If they 're surrounded , they can see it and they can act a little bit .
If they 're surrounded , they can see it and they can act a little bit .
They also green their movement and inclination .
We then realized that one of the interesting implications of the interaction was able to use common gestures , for example , " we fiid " a color if it was a liquid .
In this case , we have three Siftable configurate as a buck and I can use them to blow in the central , where you 're missing .
and I can use them to blow in the center , where they 're mischieve .
We 're too too much , we can put a little bit in the place .
There are also beautiful possibilities of learning , like language , the mathematics and logic games where people can try things fast , and see the results results immediately .
I 'm --
This is a Fibonacracracks that I do with a program of equations .
So here we have a words game between Scarabeo and Boble .
Pratically , at every turn-ranked letter at every Siftable , Pratically , at every turnal , at every turnal , at every turnal , at any way in Sifable , and as you try to compare him to do a dictionary .
Then , about 30 seconds they remissed , and you have a new letters of letters and new possibilities to try .
Thank you .
So here 's the kids came to the Media Lab , I did it so that I tried them and I turned a video .
They 're very pleased .
And one of the interesting things about this kind of application is that you don 't have to people many education .
You just say , " Compons of words , " and they know what to do .
Here are other people who try it .
This is our younger writing , there on the right .
It just wanted to impilt them .
They only were morning in the morning , for him .
Now , this is a app of an interactive cardge-.
We wanted to build a tool for the apprenticing of Lui .
It can put the characters in the scene , lifting the Siftable to them .
It can put the characters in the scene , lifting the Siftable to them .
So , it 's doing the sun .
Video : The Sun is smiling .
David Merrill : Now it 's got a horn in the scene .
Video : The arange is the arange .
Bel work !
So , the Siftable and put them close to the characters can get the characters --
Video : Bau !
-- invent its story .
Video : Hi !
DM : That 's a story with open , and it can decide him like it .
DM : That 's a story with open , and it can decide him like it .
Video : Fly , right .
DM : The last example I have time to show you is a tool , made of recent , which is a recently , in order to sample music .
It 's a tool , made of recent , to samamamamamamples .
The Siftable here are sons like sound , like , the bacteria .
Each of these has four different variations , and you can choose to use .
You can also put these sound in a sequence to get your pleasure .
And it just to move it by by doing a sound and a sequence .
These are actually actually able effects you can control from the alive , like the reverbage and the filter .
It 's attacks to a particular sound and then clens to fix it .
And then there are the general effects like time and volume , which are applied to the entire sequence .
We look at how .
Video : We 're going to start with a two-Siftable in two Siftable , we put them in a series , we 're going to end up .
Now I 'll put a bass line .
Video : DM : I add 's just about percussion --
Video : I 'm going to put the bacteria , so I can control the effect from the alive .
Video : DM : I can be the whole sequence of the time from one side , or on the other .
Video : I 'm going to add the filter to the bass of the lower expression .
Video : I can recombine the sequence to fly the sequence .
So I don 't have to plan it before , but I can improvisate , making it longer or .
And now , finally , I can springing the whole sequence on the left the Siftable .
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is to build new mo-machine interfaces more and more better than how our brain work and body .
And today , I 've had time to show you one of the results of this path , and also some possibilities that we 're trying to bring out from the lab .
The concept I want to transmit is that 's coming up this new generation of designed to interact with digital media , which will bring information in our world in the way we want .
Thank you very much .
I don 't see the time to talk to all of you .
I 'm a writer .
I 'm going to caught up , but it 's more than that , of course .
It 's also love and the fascination of my life .
And I don 't expect that it can change .
But , said , something particular happened to my life and in my career , which has brought me to get the entire relationship with this work .
The particular thing is that I recently written this book , this biography called " Mangia , " Ama , " which , diversally , in my own own books , for some reason why he got a bookstered in the world and became a great , big , bestseller , international traccount .
And the result is that wherever is , people treat me as if I were convicted .
It 's true -- you 're convicted .
They 're all on me , and they say , " Don 't you afraid to do better ?
Do you don 't have fear to continue to write for all life without being able to create a book that can important book that can be important to somebody ? "
What can you care about somebody ? "
It 's unsurance , you know .
But it could go worse , part of the one remember that I 'm over 20 years ago , when I began to say -- I was an adolescent -- I wanted to be a writer .
I 'd encounter at the same reaction based from fear .
And people said , " Don 't I 'm not going to success ?
Do you not afraid that the umillion of the reflecent kitched you ?
Do you don 't have to do this wearing for all life without anything that there 's ever going to get out of and die on a cue of dreams with the bunch of lower well-loving hit to the failure ? "
so , you know .
The answer to all these questions is , " Yes . "
Yeah , I 'm afraid of all those things .
I 've always had fear .
And I also fear to many other things that people can 't guess .
As the algae and other things .
But , as it was about to write what I thought and ask me , what I thought , and I asked me what ?
Is it rational ?
It 's logical that anybody who has to wait to be very frightened by a job that you feel to do .
But what is so particular in the impress of the creative companies that makes us nervous health is about the mental health of each other .
How my father , for example , he was a chemist engineer and I don 't remember one time in his 40 years of activity that was asked if he was supposed to be engineer ?
There was never -- that was that block of engineer John , what does ?
He didn 't work that , you know ?
Onestly , chemicals like group don 't have , in the centuries , in the centuries , lead to be alcolied by being alcolied .
We writers , we have enough this reputation enough , and not only writers , but you can create this reputation of being enormous .
And it 's not going to look at the sad context of the deaths of creative magnifeth of the green century , they die young people .
And the ones that don 't have been suicide to be really disfaced by their dungs .
Norman Mailer , before he died , in the last interview said , " My Every book killed me a little more " an extraordinary deaths about the work of their life .
But we don 't get the batter to hear it because we 've heard these things so long that we 've heard that in some way we 've completely interiorized and accepted the notion that creativity and suffering are in some way we can always always laid the art .
And the question I want to bring all the day is , you know , what about this idea ?
You know this thing -- because it 's looking at it from a centimeter of distance to me , it doesn 't do good for this supposition .
I think it 's odious .
And I think it 's dangerous and I don 't want to see perpetuate perpetuate in the next century .
I think it 's better to encourage our big minds to live .
And I certainly know that , in my case -- in my situation -- it would be very dangerous , I 'm going to get out of the dark of suppointing the circumstances that are in my career .
That 's really a -- you look at the time , they 're pretty young , I 've about 40 years .
I still have about four work decades .
And it 's very likely that anything I write now will be judged by the world like the work that came out of my last book .
I 'm going to slavery because we 're all more or less friends here -- it 's likely that my big successful is my my my deal .
Oh , Gesus , who thought !
You know this is the kind of thought that leads a person to start drink at the nine of the morning and I don 't want to do it .
I 'm going to keep doing this work that we love .
So , the question becomes , how ?
And so it seems to me , after many reflective , which the way of working to keep writing is to create a psychological construction , right ?
I have to find a sense of security between me , which I 'm writing , and my natural anxal about what the written will do , and I was trying to get out . And , as I was trying to find out of how to start looking through time , trying to find other societies to see if they could have more and more healthy ideas to see if they could have more and more healthy ideas to see if they could have more and more healthy ideas to see if they have more and look at the time ,
It 's about how to help people with the inerent people of creative emotivity .
And that research has brought me to the ancient Grek and Rome .
I 'm going to get me because it 's going to go back .
In the ancient Grek and ancient Rome -- people didn 't seem to believe that creativity were in men , OK ?
And it was thought that creativity was this reaching , and that they sold men from some different different , and unknown to men , for some distant of unknown , for reasons and unknown , for the distant and unknown .
The Greeks called these spirites of the Carian creativity .
See , wonderful , wonderful , he believed he had a load to elarggloves from distant .
The Roomoms were the same idea , but they called the kind of spirit without a genius .
That 's great , because the Rohands didn 't think that a genius was particularly smart .
They thought a genius was this kind of an entity , which was a kind of an entity , in the walls of an artist , a little bit like the elpho Dobby , and who came up if you could see the buck of hidden , the result of that work of the artist and modeling the result of that work .
Ecemotional -- here 's the distance of which I talk -- that psychological costruction that protected psychological cohone-dealing you from your work .
And everybody knew that was how it worked , right ?
So the antic artists were protected by certain things , like , the too much narcion , right ?
If your work was very exceptional , you couldn 't take all the place , all of you know that you 've been helped by this incorporate genius .
If your work failure , it was not all your ket , right ?
Everybody knew that was your genius to be a inable .
And so people han , the people who are creativity in the West for a long time .
And then the Renciment came and everything changed , and it 's all this big idea ; we put the human center of the universe above all the other and the mysteries and no longer leave space to the creatures .
This was the rational principle of humanth and people started thinking that creativity were going to be completely from the isse .
And for the first time in history , you start to refit to this or artist as a genius , like a person who with the genius .
And I have to tell you , I think that was a big error .
I think I allow somebody , a simple person to believe that being a recipient like the source , the essence and the source of all the mysteries , creativity , unknown as a responsibility , too big , to give to a file too big to give to the human psychologist .
It 's like to ask someone to enjoy the sun .
Demos and distores the ego and creates all these inexible expectations on performance .
And I think it was this pressure that I 've been destroyed to 500 years .
And if this is true , and I think it 's , the question becomes , and now ?
Can we do it very different ?
Maybe I 'll go back to a more ancient understanding of the relationship between human relationships between human relationships between human relationship .
Or maybe not .
Maybe we can 't sing 500 years of rational thinking in a 18 minutes .
And there 's some people in the audience that would have legitimate scientific , on the notion of the notion of , you know , they follow people to spend up with their projects .
I 'm not going to convince you all about this .
But the question I want to ask is -- why no ?
Why don 't I think that way ?
Because it 's more sense of everything that I 've ever heard to explain the exasperant imprevebility of the creative process .
A process that , as anyone who has ever tried to do something -- so , basically , everybody here -- you can 't compored rationally .
And , in fact , sometimes it can sometimes seem completely paranormal .
I did this meeting recently with the Ruth Stone , who has now 90 years , but he was a poetry for all life , and he said that in his childhood in the rural Virginia , working out in the field , and he felt out in if a poetry came from , when a poetry came from .
He said he was like a fragorous train .
And that was rotoling to her from the landscape .
He felt that , because he was to tremendous , because he was going down down in his feet .
He knew I had one thing to do at that point and it was of , words , " running like a match . "
And so it 's going to go home and she was sitting in this poetry , and it wouldn 't have any other than take a piece of paper and a matite enough , as the trapse , and she would pick it up and snapp it on the page .
And , it couldn 't be enough to be fast enough , so it goes and he runs and running it would have no cross to get home and the rotolar the pitch , and she would continue to rotolar through the landscape , and she would go on and rotolar through the landscape , and she would go to the other poet .
And then there were those times -- this piece of time -- there were moments where it was almost losing , right ?
So , he was running home and he was looking for paper and she was looking for paper , and he was just going to go through , and then he said , that was like if you get away with the other hand and he would step up with the other hand and steffed it .
He had the poetry from the tail and he would put it in his body and he writed it on the page .
And in these cases , the poetry would be presented on the perfect and the contrary , but the contrary to the contrary , from the last word to the first .
So when I heard it -- I 'm crazy , it 's exactly the same same as my creative process .
Not all my creative process -- they 're not a convict .
I 'm a mule , and my way to work is ; I wake up at the same orary every day and work and enjoyed on it , and I 'm going to get over here .
But even I , in my waggin , I 've been brought against that thing , sometimes .
And I suppose a lot of you the han .
You know , even if the work and ideas were to give me a certain source , I can 't know .
And what is this thing ?
And how can we relate it to it so that we can 't lose your head , but , what do we do you get to do that ?
As I 'm a good time , the best example of the contemporary example I have is the musicist Tom Waits , which I interviewed several years ago for a day .
We were talking about this , and you know , Tom , for the majority of life was the incarnation of the incarnation of the incarnation of the indeed of these species of impulses .
But then he got up , he calculated , and one day while she was driving on a Los Angeles , and he changed it .
He was going fast , and everything in a traits of this little framment of melodia , who comes in his head as the inspiration , the elusive and the wants , the desider , but you know , it 's wonderful , and the desider , but it doesn 't know how to take it .
It doesn 't have a piece of paper , it doesn 't have a matite , it doesn 't have a cycle .
So it starts to feel this species of old anxiety to him like , " I 'm going to lose , and I 'm going to get obsessed from this suncated sessed .
I 'm not good enough and I can 't do it . "
And instead of going to the panic , he stopped .
He got the whole time , and he did something completely new .
He just just just the sky and said , " Scuses , I 'm not driving ? "
" To you look like a song now ? "
If you really want to do it , you get a more opporting time when I can take care of you .
On the point , you go to importantly somebody else today .
You get to disturbing Leonard Cohen . "
And his work process changed after that .
Not the work , it was still dark as always .
But the process , and the heavy anxier that was released when the genius , the genius that was caused when the genius was going to sandl back from where , doing it was doing it .
but you can do this peculiar , wonderful , cocket collaboration between Tom and this strange , and this strange and outside that external , but it was not Tom .
So , as I felt that story began to change a little bit the way I was working and I already save me a time .
This idea , I 've got to write " Mangia , Prega , Ama , " and falls in one of those cave of the disperation where we 're causing all of something and we can 't start to think that will be a disaster , which is the worst book that I 've never written .
Not only not only , the worst book written .
And I started thinking about thanks this project .
But then I remember the Tom who was talking to the air and I tried to you .
So I got my face on the front of the wandanddressed , and I was comments to a vacuum corner .
And I said , " Loooks , what , you know , both we know that if this book is not going to be bright , no ?
Because as I 'm putting it everything I 'm , I don 't have any more of that .
So if you want to be better , you have to show you and do your side .
Okay . But if you don 't do it , you know what , I don 't do anything .
I 'm going to write the same because it 's my work .
And I want to do my part of the recorded that I 've been presented to do my part of " Because -- at the end is so , OK -- in the deserts of the North Africa people were unring for the moon , and the music that they would go on and sacking and sacred to the stuff .
And they were always magnify , because the ballerins were professional and they were great .
But every one of these artists were repair , and one of these artists became really transcendent .
And I know what I 'm talking about , because I know you all saw the view , at some point , a performance so .
It was like if the time , and the dancer walked through a kind of landscape , and it didn 't do anything different from the usual , like 1,000 night before , but all it was training .
And suddenly it doesn 't look at the same as a human .
But he 's on the diinside and he 's light-up in the flag of divinity .
And when this was going to happen , the time , people knew what was called it .
They were up to kill hands and began to sing , " Allah , Allah , Allah , God , " God , " God , " . "
That 's God , you know .
Just Churious note -- when the Mori invaded the Spain , I got this habitude with them and the pronounced in the centuries from " Allah , Allah , " to " Ole , " to " the " Ole , " which you can still feel in the corrid or fleamed in the flamp .
In Spain , when a artist did something impossible and magic , " Allah , the , the Allah , the magnificent , " ununderstandable , " incomprehensible , " -- a last of God .
And it 's great because we need it .
But , the problem comes up next day , for the danches , when you wake up and discover that are 11 in the morning of Martedesh and the last last last last of God .
It 's just a mortal with a gran evil to the knees , and maybe it will never get to sell down to that height .
And maybe nobody will be no one 's name of God as he 's going to do with the rest of his life ?
It 's hard .
This is one of the most paorful recogniliations to do in a creative life .
But maybe it doesn 't have to be so much anguess if you can 't believe , in the mostly , that the most extraordinary aspects of your being come from yourself .
But you would just believe that you 're being data in prestroke by an inimaginable source of this pointed part of your life that you have to go to somebody else else you finished .
And , you know , if we think it 's all changes .
So I started thinking about it , and it 's certainly how I thought I think about it for several months during the work of the book I 'm going to give it on , the dangerous , attesissially , followed the thing to the great success .
And what I 'm going to continue to tell when I feel it 's not afraid .
It 's not just just to your work .
It 's going to present you for your side , any can be .
If your work is dancing , you know .
If the divine , it 's absurd to you , you know , just just just a few kinds of wonderful , for one moment through your effort , then , " Ole ! "
To you , you do the same .
And , " Ole ! " You know .
I think , and I should be taught it .
" Ole ! " to yourself , only for the human writing of the human and headaunt well-headaking wearly .
Thank you .
Thank you .
June Cohen : Ole !
As you know , I 've already talked about some of these projects on the human genes , what it can mean and on the discovery of the new set of genes .
Now we 're beginning to digitize : we started to digitize biology and now we 're going to get out to the digital code we 're entering and wintathizing and wintathizing life .
We always tried to bring big questions .
What is life ? " That 's something that many biologists think they 've tried to understand vary livels .
We 've tried different approaches , reduced the minimes .
We 're digitizing from almost 20 years .
When we sequenced the human genome was about to spend from the analog of the world in the digital world .
Now we ask ourselves : can we regenerate life , or create new life from this digital universe ?
This is the map of a small organism , Mycoplasma genitalium , which is the species from the smaller genome between those that can authorean .
And we tried to reduce ulteriorly the genome to create one more .
We can eliminate a hundred genes of about 500 genes that are here .
But when we look at his metabolic map , it 's relatively simple than our .
Just me , this is simple .
But when we look at all the genes that we can eliminate , one at the time , it 's very unlikely that this can bring to a living cells .
So we decided that the only way to progree to synthesize this chromosome of these funding ctiling the components to to bring some of these fundamental questions .
So , we started the adventure of the " Can we can get a cromosome ? "
Can the chemistry to make these big molecules that we never 've been able to create these big molecules that we never have to create before ?
And , in case , can we make a cross ?
A chromosome is just a piece of inert material .
The speed with which we 're able to digitize life is growing at exponential .
Our ability to write the genetic code , instead , progrecially , but it 's getting a lot of better .
And our most recent results the results of the exponential curve .
We started over 15 years ago .
The process has been asked a lot of passages , starting with a bioethical review before we started .
But we found that synthesize DNA is very hard .
There are tens of thousands of machines in the world that are producing little segments of DNA , long , long fourth 50 letters , and it 's a degenerative process : the more error than the segment is longer , more error there are .
So we had to develop a new method to assemble these fragments and correcrecrect the mistakes .
And this was our first attempt , to start digital information of Phi genome , 174 .
It 's a little virus that kills bacteria .
We designed the fragments , effectuated the correction of the errors and get a molecule of DNA of about 5,000 letters .
The interesting part is when we took this inert chemical material , and we put it in bacteria , the bacteria have started to read this genetic code and to make viral particles .
The viral particles have been released by the cells , they went back and destroyed the E.
I 've talked about recent with the oil industry is saying that they 're certainly compressed this model .
They 've got more than you .
We think this is a situation where the software can actually build its same hardware in a biologic system .
But we wanted to do things larger .
We wanted to build the entire chromosome of the bacteria .
They 're over 580 thousand letters of genetic code .
So we thought we built in the cassets of the virus , so that we can change the cassets to understand what are the components of a living cells .
The design is crucial , and if we start with digital information in a computer , these must be very accurate .
When we sequencenced this genome for the first time in 1995 accuracy was a mistake for every 10 thousand .
We found out , resequencency , 30 error . If we had that original sequence we never would be able to do it work .
One part of the process is designing 50 letters that are very high leckers are all the other 50 letters to build underlying underlying underlying to build underlying smaller that work together .
We 're trying to the unique elements here .
You probably read that we 're going to read that we 're in the filiguring .
Think of this : We have a genetic code based on four letters : A , C , G and T.
Three of those letters are mad together about 20 loting , and there 's a specific order to read for every lotttable .
So we can use the genetic code to write words , sentences , thoughts .
What we did at the beginning is autographed it .
Some of them were dolusers from the fact that it wasn 't poetry .
We designed these segments to only join them by enzymes .
There are zymes that are repair and they put them .
And we started assemble with the parts , starting with five to seven mile the letters , unending up in a way that forming segments of 24 thousands of 24 thousands of 24 thousands of leckers at them when you get 72 thousand letters .
So , every step we 've produced these segments in abundance so that we can sequencing them up to create an extremely robuto-- as you see as a way you can see in a minute .
We 're trying to automatize the process .
So , this seems to look at the tabellon of a basket playwwet .
When we get these very long , very long , more than 100 thousand low low low low low low , they will not grow directly in E.
You get to the modern of the modern tools of molecular biology .
So we looked at other mechanisms .
We knew about another mechanism called homologa , called homologa , which in biology is ulizy to fix DNA .
Here 's an example .
This organism , called Deinococcus radiodurans , can absorb three million radiation .
You can see in the upper square like his cromosome like his chromosome .
In 12 -- 24 hours , it 's reassembled exactly how it was before .
There are thousands of organisms that are able to do it .
These organisms can sit completely .
They can live under empty .
They 're absolutely certainly that life existing in space , and you feel to find new rich water .
ASA showed it that this is .
This is an image of the molecule that we 've built using these processes , just using the yeast design of the learner segments from insert .
The yeast them assemble .
This image was not taken with a microscope electronical microscope , but with a microscope .
It 's a big molecule that we can see with a microscope .
These are pictures that cover a period of about six seconds .
This is the publication we 've done a little time ago .
They 're over 580,000 letters of genetic code .
It 's the largest molecule of a defined structure that man .
It 's got a 300 million in the perior of 300 million .
If you 're going to stick with a 10 without spaces , it would like 142 page to transcrate this genetic code .
Now , how do we work ? How can we do it ?
Obviously , you 've got a virus is play .
It 's a little bit more complicated when you use bacteria .
It 's simply simple when it 's about eucariote cells like our : you can just extract nucleus and put another one , which is basically the process of clonation .
In the archaea bacteria the chromosome is , but we 've recently demonstrated that we 're able to do a bunch of a cell from one cell to another and to activate it .
We clear a chromosome from a microbial ,
The two are different as the men from the mouse .
We 've added some genes more so that we can decide what to choice for this crumosome gene .
And then , I 'm smoke with the enzymes ,
And when we put it in the cell was amazing -- and you will appreciate our sophisticatooo-- the new chromosome -- the cromosome .
And we started thinking that we couldn 't go beyond , but we tried anymore in there .
This is one of the major mechanisms of evolution .
We found that a lot of species have added species to a second third of the third cromosome , and I adding in a second thousand tracts to that species .
So who think about evolution as one gene at the time that has not understand a lot of the biology .
They 're in the enzymes called restriction enzymes that they actually type DNA .
The chromosome that was in the cell doesn 't have one .
The cell phone , the chromosome that we put it down .
He expressed the other as expressed the other as exranean material , has masticated it , and we found it with only the cell and the new chromosoma .
It became blue because of the genes we put .
And in a short lass of time , all the characteristics of a species , went perse , and it turned all into a new species , based on the new software that we put in in the cells that we put in the cells .
All the protection have changed , the membranes have changed , and when we read the genetic code is exactly what we 've transferred .
Now , this may seem alchemy genetic software , but we altering the DNA software , we can change things in a substantial way .
Now , I 've already explained that this is not about genesesis -- but to progress from three million years of evolution , and I said that maybe we 're going to create a new version of Cambrian explosion of Cambrian explosion in which they will create new species on this digital process .
Why do that ?
I think it 's obvious to be when we think about our needs .
We 're going to go from six and a half billion people in the next 40 years .
Just to give an example : I was born in 1946 .
Now there are three people on the planet for each existent in 1946 .
We 're having problems now to find food , fresh water and policy , medical water and well-to-and-a-half billion people .
It 's going to be more hard to do it for nine billion .
We use more than five billion carbon carbon , more than 30 billion bar baries .
That means a hundred million baries a day .
When we try to find biologic processes , or any kind of process to reject them , it will be a huge challenge .
And we have to keep the whole CO2 emission of all these materials that it 's going to end up in the atmosphere .
At day , because of the discoveries all over the world , we have a database with about 20 million genes , and I like to think they 're the designed components for the future .
The electronics can only only one dozen dozen of components , and think about how many different things are coming out .
Our limitations are actually principles of the biological reality and our imagination .
Now we 've got some techniques , because of these ququick methods of rapid synthesization , able to create what we call combinatory .
We can build a big robot that can produce a million crumosomes a day .
Think of processing these 20 million genes are different genes or to get to get to produce eight drugs , new vaccines , and we can change , thank you very new , and create more biology now that 's a small team , and create more biology now that in the last 20 years of science .
And it 's just a standard selection .
We can choose to survival , chemical production or fuel , or fuel production , or walls .
This is an instanteny-software software programmed that we 're working to be able to sitting , and design species to do .
Well , we don 't necessarily know how it will be .
We know exactly how their genetic code .
Now we 're focusing on the fourth generation of the fourth generation .
You also saw you that extract from the granol was an experiment that was a bad experiment .
We have carbons of second and third generation that are going to be used to be sugar carbons than the eighttttan , or different kinds of butanol .
But the only way biology can have a great impact without increasing the cost of the food and limitary the cost of the food and limitary the cost of the way we 're working to design cells that can achieve the cost of the first ones that can achieve this . And we think we can have the first fuels of the first quarter generation in about 18 months .
The solar light with CO2 is a metodo-- but in our discoveries all over the world , we found different metods .
This is a organism that we 've described in 1996 .
He lives in deep ocean , about 2,500 meters of deep at the temperature of water .
They create meter from CO2 , they create molecular as a source of energy .
We 're trying to figure out if we can incanalate CO2 , which can easily be translated through , converting that CO2 carbon , to drive this process .
So , very short , we can be able to increase what the basic question of " which is " What 's life " is " We , verinindeed , we have the goal of the bottom of replace the whole oil industry .
Exactly . If you can 't do it from TED , where can 't you ?
It would be a main of energy .
And , we 're working to use the same metods to create instantaneous instantane-vaccines .
You saw this year with flu , we 're always forth in a year and with a dollar less when it 's about the right vaccine .
I think that it can change by building vaccines in addictive vaccines .
So , this is how the future could start looking at the time , the tree of evolution , now , accellerating evolution with synthetic bacterial cells , areas , and infine cells .
We 're at so far from the improve people .
Our purpose is to do it in a way of living enough to try to do it . Thank you very much .
First of all I 'm going to show you , the most rapidly possible , some fundamental technology we brought to Microsoft in following a year ago . This is Seadragon .
It 's a environment where you can interact is on the local level that remote with a huge amount of visual data .
So here we 're seeing a lot of the kind of digital phoom in , a kind of expensive , , and it 's for a panoramic fast , and it 's for a panoramic fast , and we want it .
And it doesn 't matter how big it is the amount of information we see , how big these things are the data , or the images .
Most are common photographs , but this is a scanning from the Library of the Congress of the Congressslow , and it reenter in the cell of 300 megapiel .
It doesn 't make any difference because the only thing that 's limits to the prestacks of a system like this is the number of pixel on your screen in any time . It 's also a very flexible .
This is a whole book , example of data not images .
This is the Casa desolate of Dickens . Each colonna represents a chapter .
To show you that it 's just about the whole thing and not images , we can do something like that , to actually see that it 's a real real representation of the tbook .
It could be a little bit artificial way to read electronic book .
I don 't know .
This is a more realistic example . It 's a number of The Guardian .
Each image is the beginning of a section .
And it really gives you the pleasure and the beautiful experience of reading the real cartacea , or a newspaper or a newspaper , which is for a moltel type of a half .
We also did something with the corner of this number of The Guardian .
We created a higher advertising advertisity -- much higher than you use in an advertising , which you can use in an advertising .
If you want to see the characteristics of this automobile , you can see it .
Or other models , or even the techniques .
And this really shows some of these ideas to eliminate the limits of space on the screen .
I hope that that 's going to be able to end up with pop-up and other things like similar , I don 't have to be necessary .
Of course , the map is one of the most obvious applications for this kind of technology .
And I don 't want to lose time , if we don 't say we have contribute to do this field .
These are all the streets in the U.S. , overlawyers above a NASA geospace .
So now we 're going to go to something else .
This is actually actually actually from the Web ; you can go to see it .
This is a project called Photosynth , which combine two different technologies .
One is Seadragon and the other is a very interesting visual computer research in Noah , a student of the University of Washington , with the aid of the University of Washington , with the Seitz of Microsoft Rick Szi Szi Microsoft Rick Szi . At collaboration .
And it 's from the live on the web , managon Seadragon .
You can see it when we do this type of screerping , where we can go from an image to the other , and have this kind of experience .
But the space collocation has actually a meaning .
The computer algorithms of the computer visualization have been layers these images together , so that they have to restable to places that are all sparked to the U.K. . Shi Grads on Montagne Rockies -- they 've been taken . Here you see the elements of a slide , or of panoric imaging , and these things were all lings are all linked .
I don 't know if I have time to show you some other environment .
There are some more space .
I want to go directly to one of the Noah-- and this is from a previous prototype of Photosynthetic that we 've done the first summer last summer , to show you what I think is really the key to the early summer this technology , Photosynth . And it 's not necessarily evident that we 've put in the website .
We had to worry about legal aspects of legal aspects and so on .
This is a re-building of Notre Dame images in Notre Dame images in Flickr . Basta digites , Notre Dame , and you get pictures of the types of the shirt , other of the campus and so on . Every one of these hanange hang , it 's discovered to this model .
So , they 're all images from Flickr and they 're all connected to space space in this way .
And it 's possible to navigate this very simple way .
You know , I would never have thought I would end to work for Microsoft .
It 's very gratifying to get this kind of accovery here .
I think you can see that it 's a lot of different kinds of photos of different photos . And the ones of the SLR professional , a meaning , put together in this environment .
And if I can , I try to look at those strange .
A lot of are stuck by faces , etc .
And somewhere here is a series of photographs -- here 's a series of photographs --
This is a poster of Notre Dame Dame recorded .
We can go from the poster to the physics of this environment .
The essential point is that we can do things with social environment . This is now taking data from all the way of the collective memory of how it looks like the Earth 's 's point of view -- and connecting all those data together .
All those pictures become connected together , larger of the substantial parts .
You have a model of the land that emerges .
Think of this as a Stephen Lawler on the virtual Earth .
It 's something that grows in complexity as people use it , and the advantages to the people use it .
Their pictures are husbed with inseries of other people .
If you get the idea of contrast all these sants saying the name , my picture of Notre Damn , suddenly , you know , I can get riches of all those data , and I can use how to make it up immergerms in that metapuniverse , using the pictures of it , and you have a screen experience of the cross-mooth .
Of course , a consequence of all that are very highly elaborate virtual models of every interesting part of the Earth , collective and satellite images and satellite images and satellite images and similar imagery .
Thank you very much .
Chris Anderson : I understand ? What your software is that your software is that you 're going to tell us to do is that at some point , in the next years , all of the world are going to be practically connected together ?
BAA : Yes . What he 's doing is basically discovered .
He 's creating hyperlink , if you want to , you know ,
And it 's doing it in the base at the content of the pictures .
The thing becomes very interesting if you think about wealth of semantement information semantement of these pictures .
As when you 're a research of the web , you get a sentence and the text on the web page has a lot of information about the pictures of the picture .
Now , what if that picture is you connects all your pictures ?
So the amount of semantical interconnection and the amount of wealth that is really huge . It 's a classic effect of the network .
CA : Blaise , it 's really incredible . Compliments .
BAA : Thank you very much .
One of the main pleasure when you travel and one of the ethnographic research is the way that has forgotten in the wind , you have the past in the wind , you have the past in the wind , you get the past in the wind , you leverage from the rain of the plants .
Baster thinking that the sciamani Jaguar is still going beyond the Lattea , or that the people are still collight-himalayas , or Himalayas , the buddists actually follow the respect of Dharmful , to remember the center of anthropology , and the idea that the world that we live in absolute , but it 's just a model of reality ,
the consequence of a particular adaptative set of adaptative choices that our estrpes has done , well .
And , of course , we all share the essential tracts .
We all propitch .
We 're subjects to start .
We need to death the inexorability of death , so we don 't surprising if we can 't whom and we can 't surprise if we can 't whom and we can 't surprise if we can 't surprise if we can 't sit and we can 't surprise if we can get out of the death .
We all have an art .
What it does is the particular rhythm of the song , the rhythm of the dance of every culture .
It doesn 't matter that are the Penan of the Borneo , or the following Vodoo 's the following Vodoo 's the Kenya , or the desert Kenya , or the Curander of Ande , or a sweet smomooth , or a sweet smomer .
He was my journey of journey in the desert a month ago , or a yak in the Yeweler , on the Everest , the dey mother of the world .
All these people teaching us that there are other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , other ways of moving around the world .
And , if you reflect a moment , it 's a concept that it can give you hope .
And with the world 's myriades of the world , it 's a ragnote of the spiritual life and it 's important to the well-being of the planet and it 's important to the well-being of the planet as a wear biologic as biosphere .
And you can think about this , cultural ragnosphere , as an etnosphere , and you can defining the total sum of all concepts , dreams , mites , ideas , inspiration , intuitions , ideas , inspiration ,
The etnosphere is the wonderful patrial patrimonium of humanity .
It 's the symbol of what we can be as inquisitive .
And because the biosphere was very , very , very , consumed as it happened to the ethnosphere , and very quickly ,
None biologist , for example , that would say that 50 percent of all species is on the orders , just because it 's fake , or -- in the most apocalyphic -- in the field of biological diversity -- and you can 't even even even even even in the most optimistic issues to the most optimistic isstic -- the cultural diversity .
The index of that is , of course , the language .
When you were born 6,000 languages on this planet .
A language is not just composed by a vocabulary or a series of rules .
A language is the sprayer of the human spirit .
It 's the half of which the animal that 's all about every culture in the material world .
Each language is a forest , a winditem , a windity-spiritual possibilities .
And of those 6,000 languages , as we 're here in Monterey , at least half the half of the kids .
They 're no longer teaching kids , which means , unless you shall the stuff that are already death .
What is the most sad of being made by the silence , of being the last to talk a language , the way of being the wisdom or to anticipate the wisdom of the deal of the deal of the deal ?
This is horring was in some of the world every two weeks , every two weeks , a old muor a door , and it brings with the last syllables and the old language .
And I know some of you will say , " Don 't it ?
The world would not be a better place if we 're talking all the same language ? " Benissim , then we talk all talk about yoruba . We talk about the cantonese .
We talk to kogi .
You 're going to sweet with what it means not to talk about your language .
I 'd like to do you to do a journey through the etnosphere --
a little journey in the etnosphere to give you a hip of what we 're losing .
Many of us forget that when I say , " different ways of existing , really different ways of existing .
We take for example this Barasana Barasana , in Amazon , the people of the anacond , which crede the myth , crede the myth to come from the snakes of the East slats in the snake of sacred sacred sacred saconia .
It 's a popular popular that it 's not able to distinguish color from green because the time you 're identified in the forest , which depends the popular .
They have a strange language and a matrimonial rule , called " examia . " We have to marriage a different language .
That 's all the radical past mitologic , but the particularity is that in these exese families where they 're talking about six or seven language because of marriage marriage .
They 're just going to hear and then they start talking .
We take one of the most interesting tribes that I lived , the Waorani of Ecuador North North North , an incredible popular that has had the first contacts in 1958 .
In 1957 , five missionaries have tried a mistake by by by by by by by by a cycle .
They did save the photographs that they thought they would think that they would think that they would think that this people who were going to think this popular forest had never seen a two-dimensional size of the rainforest .
They 've been picked up the photos , they spring them to find a form or a figture and , I 'll end that was the hell , and they killed the five missionaries with the lance .
But the Waorans don 't have to kill the foreigers .
They kill them between them .
54 percent of the mortality was caused by them .
We 've got eight generations to eight generations and we found two natural death , and when we 've got to read , they loaded that one of them was agened so that it was invecently , and then they kill it kill it .
The hunters were able to recognize the 40-steps animal urging .
In the early 1980s , I 've been assigned a very interesting task when my professor of Harvard , asked me if I wanted to go to Haiti to the underlying of the potencency of Duvalier and the Tont-Duvalier and Tont-well-up of the fast , and impossessing of the fast .
To make sense of the miraculous , I would have to understand Vodoun culture , and that Vodoo is not magic .
It 's quite a kind of a complex vision of the world .
Very interesting .
If I ask you to tell the great religions of the world , what would you say ?
Cristianity , Islam , Buddism , Ebraism , etc .
A continent is always left out , thinking that the sub-Saharan Africa has no religious feeds . And they do and the Vodoo is not the other than the distilside of these religious concepts of the religious concepts of slavery .
What makes the interesting voodoo is the intense relationship between life and death .
So , I saw the blood of the spirits .
The spirits can be invoced by the Great Acqua , they respond to the rhythm of the dance of the face of the alive in the soul of the alive in the way that for a short of acking the following becomes up the god .
So , the voodooists love to say , " You white , white , you go to the God .
We give God , and we 're going to become God . "
And since you 're okay , is the spirit that you , how do you can make bad ?
So you see these incredible events : follow the follow voodoo in the state of trance that touch hold impunties a demonstration of the power of the body when it 's catalyzed in the state of the power of the mind when it 's catalyzed in the state of exciting .
And all the popular people I lived the most extraordinary Kogi of Sierra Nevada , in the Santa Marta , in the Santa Marta , in the Santa Marta , in the Santa Marta .
It was about the tyrangements of the old Colombian plane that would be living on the charaibic planning , the people would retreat the vulchanical massive , which is ring on the vulchanical massive planture .
In a drublood continent , this people has never been conquisted by the way .
But now they 're governed by a clero , but their formation is very extraordinary .
The young people are brought out of the families to three or four years , and they sitting in a world of buy and shadow in a world of dark and shadow in stone at the base of the glaciers for 18 years .
Two periods of nine years of course to reproduce the nine months of management to reproduce the nine months of management that spring in the useres of the Grange of Mother .
So , for all this time , they 're acculturate to the values of their society , the values that prey them to keep the cosmic balance -- or to say the equilibrium -- or to say the equilibrium of the balance --
At the term of this incredible began , they 're suddenly took out and for the first time in their 18 years , they see an alba . And in that moment , you know , the sun of the first ball of the blood valle-screen , everything that has learned in theory . And the prete a step it , all that it 's done a peck . And the prete one step it back and it 's : it 's not that it 's going to be .
" Where ? Proly how I said .
It 's amazing . Now it 's really to protect it . "
They call the biggest brothers and they say that we , the minor brothers , we 're the collipaign of the world .
This level of intuition is extremely important .
When we think about the Ingence populations and the environment invoice Rousseau and the old history of wild noble , which is a razer in his simplicity or maybe we invote Thoreau and we say these people are closer are closer to the Earth of us .
Instead popular popular people are not indeed by the nostaly .
There 's no space for these things in the malaric paludes of the Asmaller or the winddry , but thank you to the rate and the rules , they created a mystical of the Earth 's not about concept of it , but on an untuition of the near intuition , but it 's not about the idea that the Earth can live because it 's uninfuse human consciousness , because it 's unlikely to human consciousness .
What does that mean ?
He wants a kid who grow up in the Montana is growing up , and it will be a spirit Apu who will leave his destiny different , and it will have a human being a deeply different , and it will have a very different destroke with the mountains or that place that it grows up is a lower of rock .
That 's the dimad-one spirit or a mineral , it 's irrelevant .
What 's interesting is metaphor that defines the relationship between the individual and the natural world .
I grew up in the forest of the Columbia , creating that forests were going to be cutated .
That made me a human being different from my friends Kwakiutl who believe that the forests are the Hamkuk 's dise and the binkuk 's historic and the binkuk 's historical , who live to the world 's deal with the Hamatsa .
If you start to look at these these cultures can create different reality , you can start to understand some of them , you know , they make these plants .
I took this picture to open up in the nordoccccially ,
Mayahuasks , maybe some of you heard of ayahuasca , the most powerful substance of the sciamanic repertoire .
What makes it fascinating the ayahuasca is not the farmacological potential of the substance of the substance of substance , but his elaboration . It 's composed by two elements .
On one side , this lapart that has a series of beta-carboline , harmoline and harmoline , harmoline , and harmoline ,
Taking the only plants , you have a blump blusters , but it 's choice with the leaves of a coffee of the coffee of the coffee Psychoria , of the family in the coffee Psychoria , and it 's a blueer of the coffee of Psychoria , but it 's just a blup blue blusters ,
This plant is powerful trippptamine , very similar to the serotonin , dithoxtamine-5 , methoxptaminy .
If you 'll see the Yanomami you get Yanomami pull up the substance that they do a different set of species , you 're contains .
Tiring that powder is a little bit like being disappeared by a little bylew of paper dipink , and landing on a sea of electricity . Risate not creates a distorsion of reality ; it creates the dissolution of reality ;
I was often with my professor , Richard Evan Shultes , the man who save the psychic was well-fabricated , with his discovery of the hallucinogenic fungi in the 1930s .
And I think , you can 't be smoke these trippptamines like the training , because if you can 't tell no one of being hallucinated . Do you can 't be sunds up in the intended up , because they 're denied by a zyme , because they 're denied by a zyme , who is is obgenestine of course .
It 's possible to take the orally only if you 're assume with other chemicals that they denied ,
Now , the beautiful cool : beta-carbon , which are in this liana are inhibiteen of MAO , the same type of potential to potential tripptamines . The question of spontaneous , how do these people find two morogical morogically not that , which if you combine it in this way , they make a biog .
We use the great euphery of the proof of the proof the error , which can be infrule .
But if you ask the Indians , they 'll tell us , " Please . "
What does that mean ?
This tribes , the Cofan , has 17 variety of ayahuasks , which are narely in the forest , and that our eyes would remain in the forest , and that our eyes would remain in the forest .
If you ask them how they 'll stand they 'll say , " I thought , " I was thinking about plants , you don 't know everything ? "
The solution is : take the 17 variety of a moon , and each one will sing with a different tone .
With not there , you know , in Harvard , but it 's much more interesting than contact the stones .
Now , [ applausi the problem is that even the ones of us who have to heart people find them in paintings are painting , but somehow reducts to our real world , and it 's going beyond .
In fact , the 19th century , in 300 years , it will not remembered to its lead or innovations , but rather as the one was where we stopped and actively embraced , or accepted a very , very high , or accepted , or accepted , or the planet . Now the problem is not the change .
All cultures through the centuries were involved in a new place for new possibilities of life .
And the problem is not technology .
The Indians are not stopped to be Sioux when they put up the arc and they 're recks like Americans don 't have stopped to be American when they put up and heat .
It 's not the change or the technology that they threat the nine . It 's the power .
The last fly of the domination .
And if you give a look at the world , you 'll find that these are not destinated cultures that these are not destinated cultures to disappear .
They 're living creatures and dynamic creatures that are beyonic creatures that go beyonic existence that go beyonic .
I 'm in the paper of the Plaps in the Plaps of Penan --
a people of Sarawasian people in Sarasian Asian , a popular popular that lived in the forest until a generation ago , and now reduced to the servites and prostitution on the reversion of the rivers , where you can see the river fabulous Meridionous Cinese Meridional Meridional Meridional Meridional Meridiond , where the Japes are the horizon the horizon is the horizon the gent ,
Woking the wood stocks with the forest .
Or , in the case of Yanomami , are the disease that are the way with the discovery of the gold .
If we move on on the mountains of Tibet , where I 'm doing a lot of research , you 'll see the laster fly .
As you know the genocide , the physical extinction of a popular popular , but the writing , the writing of life of a popular lifestyle of a popular popular , not only is not only not only , but even it 's not just celebrate , but even celebrate in the development of the strategigic .
And you can 't understand the suffering of Tibet until the beginning .
I 've been around 6,000 miles from Chengdu in Westerdu in China through the West Tibet , and it 's coming to Lhasa with a young connection , but only came to Lhasa with a young connection , but only came to Lhasa . I realized what 's behind we feel about .
6,000 sacred sacred sacred in the dust and cenjoyed .
1.2 million people killed by military in the Cultural Revolution .
The dad of this guy was ascriticized at the Panchen Lama .
That 's been killed in the time of Chinese invasion .
His sauce in Santity in Santity , during the diaspora that has brought the people in Nepal .
Her mother was imprigioned and his colmelt was rich .
It was brought to habit at the age of two years from under his gonna because it wouldn 't have to live without him .
The sister , who did the same , was put in reduction .
One day he inaved a day , he inaved a Mao , and for this transgression , it was put to the jobs , it was put in the jobs for seven years .
The Tibet 's pain 's unbet , but the recently spirit of the people 's popular .
And then , it reduces a choice .
We want to live in the world in the monothic of the monothy or we want to accommodity of diversity ?
The great pathoga Margaret Mead , before he died , he said that his largest fear was that , in our way to be able to see the whole range of the world , not only we 'll see the whole gamord of human imagination , but one day we 're going to see it from a sleep on a very limitation , but one day we 're going to get some other possibilbilbilbilities .
And it 's umillion of remember that our species is existing for 600,000 years .
The Neolitic Rvolution , who gave us the agriculture , which has done us underlies to the seed of the skip , which is a shamp with the prosance of the skip , and we talk about 10,000 years ago .
The modern world has 300 years old .
That 's not not suggests that we have the answers that we have the answers to all the challenges that we should deal in the millennia to come .
When you get these myriades of the world , they asked what it means to be human , they 're asking 10,000 different voices .
And it 's in these answers that we all have the possibilities of being what we 're : a kind of a consciousness , which has to make all the people and all the gardens can fix . And there are great moments of optimises .
I took this picture on the northern extremity of the North island , when I went to whales with the Inuit , and this man , Olayas , Olayas , Olayas , and this man , Olayas , he told me the wonderful story of his grandfather .
The Canananadian government was always weless with the Inuit and in the ' 50s to stbilish our sumatiatic , we have them in colonies .
The grandfather of this man refuted to go .
The family , I teming her life , I took him all the boundaries , and all his attitudes .
You have to know that Inuit doesn 't temat the cold , they exploit .
The packs were sleep in origin were made of pain boking .
The grandfather of this man didn 't stand in the middle night or from the libraric at night or that was suffering .
It 's sgatter , it calculated the pintintalls , and defecated in their hand . When they did it , you 've got it , you work , you work , they did it by making a moama .
He springed up on the points of this hap hit and when it solid , it killed a dog .
He sleep the dog and created a brilliant , with the hacic cass has created a sleep , and it 's disappeared on the buck , habit of the caccine , hit in the habit .
We want to cavare with nothing ? [ Radian ] . And this , in different ways , [ Applausi is the symbol of resilience of the Inuit and all the popular popular the world .
In the aprile 1999 , the California government has reached the total control of an area of the largest territory of the larger California and Texas I put together .
It 's the new paa . It 's called Nunavut .
It 's an independent territory . They 're all the resources .
One example of the way of how a natione-state can recognize with his people .
And , to finish , I think it 's quite obvious at least at least in these remote areas of the planet , realizing that they 're not remote in the world . And I think it 's pretty obvious .
For somebody is home .
They represent severtions of human imagination that are going to get up at the time . And for us all , the dreams of these kids , like the dreams of our children , they become part of the geography of hope .
Fining , we 're in National Geographic , we 're convinced that politicians will never come to .
We think the polemies --
[ Applausi are not persuasive , but we believe that stories can change the world , and maybe we 're the best institution to tell the stories of the world . Every month , our website is 35 million visit visit .
156 countries , they spring our television channel .
Our review are thrites from millions of people .
Our work is to travel in the etnosphere to bring our audience of cultural wonderful , from which they will sunced how they 've seen and , you hope , abbracching , you will , you know , the central resption of anthropology : the world of exististing in the diversity , and we have to find a lifestyle of life in a pluralist and multicultural styping ,
where the wisdom of all the people can contributing to our collective well-being .
Thank you .
I 'm going to talk about some things that I 've written in this book that I hope you 've already heard and I 'm going to try to get some connections , in case not notice it .
I want to start with what I call the " dogma official dogma .
Do the official dogma of what ?
The official dogma of all the Western industrial dogma 's dogma , " If you want to massixize the well-being of our citizens . "
The reason is , by one side , in fact that freedom is in fact that freedom is a value , is utile , essential for human beings .
On the other is that if we 're free , each of us can act to do it for doing all that that massive to do everything that massive , no one that you can do not anybody that we 're going to .
The way to massive freedom is massimilar .
The more choices are the people have , the more libar , and more is their wealth , the more of the freedom , the wealth .
This , I think , it 's so deeply radical in the society that nobody would dream of putting it in doubt .
And it 's also rooted in our lives .
I 'm going to show you some examples of what progress has made possible .
This is my supermarket . It 's not particularly big .
I lose a simple note on the conditions for saved .
In my supermarket are 175 conditions , without content 10 variety of oil extravergins that are 112 of the whales that you can buy to you a huge amount of conditions in the increscracives that nobody of the 175 pronings your degrees .
That 's how the supermarket .
And then you go to the electronic store to buy a stereo : you know , CD , radio , radio , piaright , the leveling .
And in this single core of electronic store , there 's a great number of audio components .
We can do six million different fight different combinations using the components that there are only one store .
You have to admit that there 's a lot of choice .
Other fields : the world of communications .
Once , when I was a kid , you could get all the desire telephone services , at the breakdown that were fornites .
It was not bought the phone , you didn 't buy it .
A consequence of that , the next one was that the phone never would break .
These days are gone .
Now we 've got a neararareas of telephones , especially between the mobile phones .
Here 's the mobile phones of the future .
My favorite is the MP3 , MP3 , cut , cut out of the nose , and it promise for the By my bad bad my my my my my my bad bad .
If you don 't have yet seen it in the store under the house , you 're very well going to get .
And what happens is that people are in the goods and they ask this question . And you know what the answer is , " No . "
It 's not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn 't do too many things .
So , in other aspects of life which are much more important than the acquired of the aquers , you know , the same choices .
Assistence , the blood : it doesn 't happen to the U.S. that you 're going to tell you what you have to do .
Instead , you go to the doctor , and the doctor says , " Okay , we could do A , or B , " A has these benefits and the risks . What do you want to do ? "
You say , " Doc , what should I do ? "
And the doctor says , " You have these benefits and the risks , you have these benefits and these answers . "
" What do you want to do ? "
And you say , " Doc if she was me , what would you do ? "
And the doctor , " But I 'm not . "
The result , we call it " mality " , " expression , " expression that it seemed to make a beautiful thing .
But it 's not that a move the weight and responsibility to make decisions from somebody who knows something about it , which is the doctor , to somebody else else knows nothing -- and it 's not about it 's right -- and so it 's not in the ideal to make decisions the patient .
There 's a huge marketing produced pharmaceutical products , direct to people like me and you , that if you think you don 't have any sense , because you can 't buy them .
But if we can 't buy them , why you get them ?
The answer is that they want to domorning we call the doctor to ask them to change the recipe .
Something that 's fundamental as our identity is a question of choice , as you see in this jamp , " We don 't want to force the kids . " We don 't want to force the kids at the right time . " We don 't get more identity : we need to invent it .
And we can reinvented how many times we can get them .
That means that every morning , you have to decide you have to decide what you want to be .
It was at the family and to marriage , a time perspective , a common time , it almost for anyone , it was that it was that you could be marriage , and it started to get the most price possible .
The only real choice was with who , not when , and even what to do after .
Ose , it 's really to play .
I 'm very smart students , and I do 20 percent in less than a time .
And it 's not because they 're unbrilliant , not because they 're less diligent .
but why I 'm impensive , intent , I mean , " Would I have to get to do this right now ? Do you do this right now ? "
" Would I say to me later ? I have to think before you go to the kids or career ? "
They 're interrogatives logoranananants .
And they try to answer these questions , even if this implacy not to complete the companies I asking and not getting a beautiful vote to my examples .
And they really have to do it . They 're important questions .
Now , the work : We 're lucky , like Carl , because the technology allows us to work every minute , every day , every day , every single single angle of the planet , except that from Hotel Randolph .
I 'm talking about , there 's a corner , and I 'm not going to tell no one , where the WiFi works .
I don 't tell you , because I want to use it .
What does this mean , this amazing freedom of choice that we have about work ? It 's that we 've got to keep on , if we have to work or not .
We can go to see our son playing hot , with the cell phone , the Blackberry in the other , and the news , and the news , typally , on the glasses .
And even if they 're all spent , every minute we see our child , we 're also asking the game , we 're also asking this called ?
" Did I have to answer this email ? I have to get this letter ? "
And even when the answer is " no , " all this makes the experience of your game , very different than that that would have been in other conditions .
So , anywhere we look at all , little things and big , materials and big , materials and life is a question of choices .
Once the world was this : That 's not a little bit of choice .
The world of today , it looks like this : The dilemma is , " Is it a positive thing , or negative ? "
The answer is Surch .
The positive lates we all know , so I 'm going to talk about negative ones .
That 's all this choice compories two negative effects on people .
The first , paradoxally , is that it makes a paralysis that it makes liberation .
With a lot of options between which choices , it becomes very hard to do it .
I give you an example of a meaningful example : a flap on volunteer .
A connects has had access to the Oly-Vange data , the giant society of depension , with about a million of clients in 2,000 different companies .
What she found is that for every 10 solutions that are offerte in more , the percentage of two percent .
With 50 four-offerals , there 's 10 percent in less adhesions than only five . Why ?
Because with 50 fourds between which choice , it 's maledtely difficult to decide , and the choice is remadient .
And I 'm going to tomorrow , and I still tomorrow , tomorrow , and of course , it 's never coming .
You know , it doesn 't mean that these work from old people who are going to eat for dogs because they don 't have enough money , it also lose the decision is so hostical that they also lose the funds of the work .
They 're not participating , they 're losing until five dollars a year from work , which would be very well .
So , the paralysis is a consequence of having too many choices .
And I think it makes the world like that .
" And to finish , for ethchup , " " Hemaion , " or " ? "
You would like to take the right decision , if it 's for ethernity , right ?
You don 't want to choose the wrong background , and you 're not going to get a wrong .
So this is the first effect . The second is that even if we can evoote the paralis and do a choice , finally we 're less , we would be done by the result of how we would be states with less options .
And this is for different reasons .
One of these is that with many of the people who choice , if you bought a and it 's not very easy to imagine that you would have been better , it 's easy to imagine that you would have been better . And what happens is that the alternative imagine that it would be better . And what happens is that the alternative imagine , and the repeoples the same time , and the reaches the soon .
And when it was a great decision .
More choices are , the more easy to displeasant than any detail that it 's insodatives of choice .
And also , there 's what economists call cost .
Dan Gilbert has been very well stamattine like the value that we 're confront of things about .
Of course , when there are many options , it 's easy to represent the account characteristics of the areas and be less satis-choice .
Here 's an example . I 've all been a lot of the ones that are not New York .
But that 's what you would probably think .
There 's this copy in the Hamptons .
A by-by-by-up place .
It 's all about splendida . It 's all about it .
Not nothing . But what he thinks is , " Well , the buildings , it 's Agotten . "
" All my neighbors in Manhattan are off . "
" I could talk about giving right in front of the home . "
And it 's going to flow two weeks and assilay -- every day -- the possibility of parking where it wants .
The constoking opportunity decrease the satisfaction for what we 've also , as a cell choice was .
And the other people are the options that we 've been considering , the more the features are going to return us to how it will cost .
Here 's another example .
This is telling us a lot of things .
It 's about the time , and maybe it 's a slowly .
But the most important point is that anything you get choice , you get down to not do other .
The things that we don 't choose to attract that can make less active what we do .
Third point : the spiral of the growth of expectations .
I tried it on my skin buying a new couple of jeans .
I 'm nearly jeans .
Once the jeans were just a type , buying them and besight besty , they were forced , only after they were brought a life and work a lot of times , they started going .
So , I went to buy a couple of a new when the old old old old were going , and I said , " I need a couple of jeans , this is my cutting . "
The committed me , " Look a slim , quick fit , relaxed ? "
He wants to the certainer or the buttons ? " Stonewashed , " Stoneashed " ? "
" Do you want to strate ? "
" Do you want to walk or stretch ? Bla bla bla -- " Continuated it .
I was sbalord , and after a while I was able to say , " I want the guy that was the only type , " He had no idea what was , so for a time , I tried all of the jeans , and then I 'm out of the best one , I 'm going to do with the best pair of jeans that I 've ever had .
It was the massive . With all that I had the best .
But I felt worse .
Why ? I wrote a whole book to understand it .
The reason I was worse that I was worse with all that choice were high , the jeans had to be perfect .
I first had the beginning of the beginning . I didn 't expect to do anything exceptional when it was only one guy who saw 100 different , accidents , at least a type had to be perfect .
What I was bought was good , but not perfect .
After I had a chosen to the choose with what I was trying to do in comparison the expectations .
The adding options in life of people don 't do that increase the excellence of the options of the same .
And this will produce less satifation , even when the results are good .
None in the world of marketing , if you realize .
Because if they knew , you wouldn 't know what I 'm talking about .
The truth looks more like this .
" He was better when it was worse . " The reason that was better when it was worse was that when it was worse was still possible to meet some of surprised surprised .
Over the world where we live in -- opulents , industry , citizen , industry with the expectancy of performing expectations .
You never have surprised press because your waitative , my expectations , they 're injanked .
The secret of happiness -- what you 're here -- is , " Baxis , you want . "
I mean , little high-whographic time -- which are really married and my wife is really amazing .
I could not do that better , I couldn 't do it .
But it 's not always account is a bad thing .
And finally , a consequence of bought a couple of jeans . And then , you know , it 's that when you 're not satisfacts , and you ask you , " Why ? "
" Who is responsible ? " , the answer is clear .
The world is responsible . What could I do you ?
When there are hundreds of kinds of jeans , and you bought a insody-like responsible , and you ask who is the responsible , it 's the accountable , it 's the accountable you .
You could do better .
With hundreds of variety of variety , there are no smomostly .
So when people get people decisions , even if the result is soly-dissending , you feel like , and they 're going to give the hit to their own .
In the last years , the depression is exploded in the industry .
I think a factor -- not the only one , but important -- of this thing -- of this honate depression is that people have delude delude experiences because the standards are too high .
And when they have to explain this situation they think that the colpe is they think .
So the final result is that we 're better , objectively , but we feel worse .
Let me remember you .
This is the official dogma , what we all take for good and it 's completely fake . It 's not true .
There 's no doubt that a little bit of choice is better than I have it , but it doesn 't take it from this one of them , but it doesn 't take a little choice is better than a little bit .
There 's a critical value , magic . I don 't know what it is .
But I 'm sure we 've been enough to a piece of enough , the level where the choices are improving our life .
Now , from political point of view -- I 've almost finished -- from political point of view , the cracle is the follow .
What it allows us all this choice in the industrial society is wealth .
There are many places in the world , and you know , there are a lot of choice in the world , which the problem is not that they have too many choice .
The problem is that they have too pok .
So the factory I 'm talking about is a malbeing extrusive of modern , rich society , Western society .
And what it does to depress and climbing is this : Steve Levitt Levitt has talked about about how much of those expensive and seats for the babs are unuseful .
I mean that these choices , complicated and complicated avendious , it 's not just unuseful .
I 'm even deleteries .
They 're doing worse .
If you have a little bit of what in our society would allow as they were reversed in those where people have too few possibilities , it would not only be the way to improve but our own life .
That 's what economists call a parken-improvement .
A redistributtion is good for all the time -- not only to poor -- because of this choice in excess that we get us .
To conclude , " Fille , you can become everything you want " --
You , people of culture , you think , " What does it create that fish ? "
" It 's obvious that you can 't do anything in a glass . "
" A castrated , a limited vision of the world --
and I 'm going to have interpreped it so , at the beginning .
But then , I think , instead , I realized that that the fish knows the long .
Because the reality of the fact is that if you send in frantum the box , so that " you can 't get the freedom . You get the paralysis .
If you break the box in a way that all the decrease can decrease .
You get the paralysis , and you 'll reduce the well-being .
They all need a sphere .
This is almost certainly too closely , maybe even even for the fish , and certainly for us .
But the absence of a little baby of the sphere is a recipe for infelity and , I 'm afraid of course .
Thank you very much .
