I showed these these slides to show that the glacial calottartics , that for almost three million years , had the 48 , for almost three million years , had the 48 continental dimensions of the 48 .
But this undergraduate gravity of the problem because it doesn 't show the rooms of the ice .
The arctic hootage calotta is , in a certain sense , the clean , the heart of the global climate system .
You expandd to the winds and the summer .
The next slide will be a rapid carrelated to the dead related to the last 25 years .
The laces loved in red .
You see , they expand to the blue .
That 's the ice in the winter , which is to extra exact on the walls .
You can see that the cosidges , of five years , or more , is like blood , that 's like blood , that 's a blood here .
In 25 years , it 's past , at 25 years , so .
This is a problem because the heat at interest , the pyacked the the ice ice ice ice ice , where there are huge amounts of carbon congelated that , the leaving , they 're transformed in the microbes .
I think about totality of the inatmospician from global warming , that amount could double-to-scale , so that could doubt , super---breathing .
In some deep laghi , in Alaska meter , it 's already rebolling from water .
The professor Katey Walter of the University of Alaska team , a team of a team , a team of a lake blow last winter .
Video : Wow ! Al Gore : Wow ! Al Gore : if we 're going to be .
A reason is that this termal surry from the North Groenland from the northern .
This is a glacial regime .
The labled never reached to levels them .
This is the Kangerlussuaq , in the west of the Groenland .
If you want to know how the sea level of the sea glaceful of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice .
These are running out of the well-to-butterly .
Another part of the planet : Antarctica , the largest block of the planet .
The last month scientists have dichied that the painting of ice is in negative , and that the Western Antarctica , that poggia on some islands , it 's particularly very quickly in the wild .
It 's six feet of the miles of the activity , like Groenland .
Sulla Himalayas , the third largest block of ice , they see new laghi , that few years ago .
40 percent of the population of the population is half of the water from that the property .
Sulle Ande : this glacier is the source of the water .
The laten has increased .
But when it 's demines , the same happens to the water .
In California , the nenow , the Nevada is 40 percent .
The idrices are in crisis .
The predictions , as you read , they 're great .
The growth of the world is a remarkable to the intain remarkable .
The environmental disasters are increasing a rithm out of the normal and without precedented .
Four times more numbers in the last 30 years of the last 30 years of the precedented .
This is a whole wandment of all insustainable .
If you look at the context of the context , they can see the consequences .
In the last five years , we added 70 million tons of CO2 every 24 hours -- 25 million tons in the ocean every day .
Look at the Eastern area of the oriental Pacific , to the west , and both both of the Indian parts of the obsigene , where there 's a roadical imor the waste of the ocean .
The major cause of global warming , and the deforestation , which is 20 percent , is the use of fossil fuel .
The oil is a problem , and the carbon is even worse .
The United States is one of the two countries with more emissions , together to China .
And it was proposing to build many other central carbon .
But we 're seeing a direction of the way .
These are the anullated projects in the last few years and some green alternative alternative proposes .
Every way , there 's a political lower in our country .
The carbon industry and oil have spent 250 million dollars in the last year to promote carbon , which is a bsigggolden , which is a oxide .
That 's a picture of me something --
See Natale , in the Tennessee , where I live , there was a 3.8 billion ligalls of carbon .
You 've seen it on news .
This is the largest flow of the past past America .
It 's happened around Natal .
The nalization of one of the carbon industry was this .
Video : It 's got the very good coal is a kind of allegro and happy .
It 's abundant here in America , and it 's growing our economy .
Frosty carbon , it 's more and more and more and more clean .
It 's a good price , adorable and the work is the wild .
Al Gore : Froginia is a lot of the West Virginia .
The largest mineral society on mountains is Massey Coal . This is his administrator .
Video : Don Blankenship : I 'm going to have -- Al Gore , Nancy Pelosy Pelosy , Harry Reid -- they 're not going to know what they 're talking about .
Al Gore : So the Alleance for Protextion of Clima has launched two campaign .
This is a part of them .
Video : Acore : Actually , we see the climate change change as a minacts as a great-minacts in our business .
So our priorities is investing a great amount of money in a effort to make public and confused the truth and confused the truth .
In fact , carbon 't it .
We think we 're going to think , it 's also a good profum .
So , not precupatate of climate change .
Let me do it to us .
Video : Acore : Carbone , you heard a lot of heard about it .
So we 're doing a lot of a structure of the avaning of the board of how much coal .
Straordinary ! The machines are a little rumorous , but this is the sound of carbon technology .
The carbon consumption is between the main cause of global warming , but the remarkable technology of the global carbon , that you can see changes everything .
You look at a look , this is the odiernal technology .
Al Gore : Infine , the positive alternative , the positive alternational security .
Video : The America is in crisis ; the economy , the national economy , the national security crisis .
The file that connects all : our dependence from the fossil combustible fuel , like the sporite of the most of the oil and oil oil oil .
But , there 's a new , audace , audace solution to use .
Rpower : 100 percent of clean energy , in 10 years .
A to reput America to put America to work , make sure , and help stop the global warming .
Finally , a solution that basts to solve our problems .
Repower . It 's more .
Al Gore : This is the last one .
Video : How to return energy to America .
One of the fastest ways to bring to dependence from the combustible to killing our planet .
Comparse : The future is here . I feel , a new energy network .
Comparsa number two : Neggs for the investment of work .
Comment : Repower America . It 's time to be realists .
Al Gore : A old proverbio : A proverbio says , " If you want to go fast , you go to the soldiers .
If you want to go back to , you go together . "
We have to go away , fast .
Thank you very much .
Last year at TED , made a introduction of the LHC .
And promise to get update to get update to how the car works .
So there 's a way . And for the ones that the other time , there were no , the largest scientific experiment ever trial -- 27 kilometers of circumstoms .
Her compulies are at least to rerearing the conditions that were at less than a billion times from the beginning of the universe -- until 600 million times a second .
All this is simply environmental .
This is the machine in Ginevra .
We 're going to take these mini-Big Bang in the relevators .
This is what I work . It 's called ATLAS -- large-foot , 44 feet and has a 22 feet of 22 feet .
This is a spectacular picture of ATLAS in building so you can see proportions .
Ten september last year , we acceso the car for the first time .
And this picture was taken by ATLAS .
It was made of immense festeggiving in control room .
It 's an image of the first fascination that had done all the way around the LHC , entering in collision , with a part of the HC , and spread particles into the relevator .
In other words , when we see that image , we knew that the car was a great writing , that 's a great wintory .
I don 't know if it was this to do , and I 'm not going to do this , when somebody went on Google and vide that the page was this .
That means we have had a cultural impact beyond .
About a week later , there was a problem with the car , had to these blood here -- these blind blood .
These files 13,000 amps when the car works at the power of the power of the power of the power of the power .
Now , the technicians of you will look at the files and say , " It 's not true . I 'm too too much too much . "
And they can do it because when they 're very cosidded by becomes the superconflict .
So , at least 271 degrees , at least 271 degrees , in the space between the stars , these blocks can bring that running that runs .
In one of the giuntures of the most of the magneti magneti in the LHC , there was a fecof a fabbrication .
So the file fixed , they surgery slightly , and 13,000 to have an electrical resistence .
This was the result .
Now , this is even more impressive if you think these magneti fish more than 20 tons , and that are moved about 30 centimeters .
They 're damateful about 50 magneti .
We had to take them , what we had done .
We restinated them and upon the well-upon .
Now they 're going to go back to their place place .
By the end of the march of the LHC is going to be again integral .
We 'll access it , and we 're looking at the data , and we 're going to go to the bunch of data , and continuing so our adventure to find out what the universe is the universe .
Now , of course , in a certain way , these accidents return the dibate on the value of science and engineering the value of science and engineering the front of science and engineering the front of the future .
I think the fact that the fact that the thing is so hard , I think that 's the value of things like LHC .
I want to end with the words of a English scientists , Humphrey Davy , which , imagine , in difetc , the inuse of the experiments of his pupille , his Michael Faraday , he said , " Nient is so dangerous for progress of human mind as well as the human riting is definitely dangerous , that we don 't have new , that our trial science , that our tribull is a confant , and that we don 't have a conqueren 't be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be a conququququququake the human human human human human human human human human human human human human human human human human human human mind , as well . "
Thank you .
I want to start to ask you to rethink of when children , you played with the hongs .
And as you understand how to get them to get them , and take them , and move them , you know , you know , you know , how to think and solve problems with space .
The space reasoning is deeply connected to the way we understand a part of the world around us .
So , from the inspired use of our interaction with physicists , together to my physical objects , together to my consulent Pats , and my collaborator Jeevan Kalanithi , I started asking a computer , instead of having only have the cursor of the mouse as a bottom , as a bottom , we could deal with your hands , we could deal with hands , we could take a blood , you 're going to be the boundaries , we could we go to have a bundly deal with a information to be a bute a bate , a information with a information with a information , with a information , with a information , with a ble-hands ,
and sistage it to our please ?
The question was so interesting that we decided to explore the answer , building the Siftable .
In a few words , a Siftable is a interactive computer interactive as a biscoscope .
In a few words , a Siftable is a interactive computer interactive as a biscoscope .
You can move with the hand , they can , " see " between them , " to feel the movement and they have a screen and a radio wireless .
But most of course , are physicists , like the morning , as the morning , you can move the way .
The Siftable is the example of a new ecosystem of tools to manipulate the digital information .
And as they become more physicists , consciousness of the movement , of the other , and as they become more physicists , consciousness of the other , of how we die them , we can explore new and different styles of interaction .
I 'm going to start with some simple example .
This Siftable is configurate to show video video : if you 're going to fill the video .
These interactive ritational rats are consciousness of others .
If you face them , they 're interested in what they 're interested in what they 're around .
If they 're surrounded , they can act a little bit .
If they 're surrounded , they can act a little bit .
They also great-like their movement and inlination .
We realized that one of the interests of the implications of the interaction was to use managers on data , for example , " we pay a color like it was a liquid .
In this case , we have three Siftable configurate as a green bespecially and I can use them to the color in that central , where they mixed .
and I can use them to the color in that central , where they mischieve .
If we 're too much , we can put a little bit of place .
There are also beautiful possibility of apprentice , like language , the mathematics , and the logic games where people can try things things very quickly , and you know the results are immediately .
Now I 'm --
This is a Fibonaches I do with a program I doing with a equations .
We have a words that 's a words that 's in the half of the Scarabeer and Boble .
Pratically , at every wild , you get a letter to every Siftable , Pratically , every Sifable , you get a letter to every Sifable , and as you know , as you know , and as you know , the other words , and as you know , and as you compored with words ,
And then , after about 30 seconds they remix , and you have a new leck set of reading and new possibility to try .
Thank you .
Here 's how children came to the Media Lab , I did a way that I triassed them and I went to a video .
They are very pleased .
And one of the interesting things like this kind of application is that not to give people a lot of instructions .
You just say , " Compons of words , and they know exactly what to do .
Here 's what other people are trying .
This is our younger tester tester , there on the right .
It actually wanted to just impilling them .
They only are morning , for him .
Now , this is an application of a interactive cartoon .
We wanted to build a tool for the Lui of language is Felix .
It can insert new characters in the scene , you know , and you know , and you know ,
It can insert new characters in the scene , you know , and you know , and you know ,
So , this is doing the sun .
Video : Sun is surgend .
David Merrill : Now , she took a hold hold in the scene .
Video : The arange hold .
Bel work ! Yeah !
So , the Siftable and putting close close to interact the characters --
Video : Bau !
-- inventing your story .
Video : Hey .
DM : It 's a story with the open , and it can decide him how you 're going to go .
DM : It 's a story with the open , and it can decide him how you 're going to go .
Video : From , just like .
DM : The last example I have time to show you is a tool , to sample , to sample and exeguing music .
It 's a tool , made of recent , to sample and exeguing music .
The Siftable here are act by the basis , based on the bottom and bacteria .
Each of these has four different variations , and you can choose what to use .
You can also insert these sound in a sequence that you can compories .
And it 's just to do touch a " sound , " it 's " " and a sequence . "
These are actually actually that you can control from the vial , like the reverber and the filter .
The attacks to a particular sound , and then inches for traveling it .
And then there are the general effects as time and volume , that they applied to the intersequence .
We look at how it works .
Video : We 're going to start a basic basic in two Siftable sequence , we 're going to put it in a series , we add the other basic .
Now I put a bottom line .
Video : Now add of percussions --
Video : And now I 'm going to put the bacteria , so I can control the effect from the vial .
Video : I can be able to be able to be able to be able to be a time by the way or the other .
Video : I 'm going to add the filter to the low filter to the low plane to give more expression .
Video : I can recombine the sequence of the flight .
So , I don 't have to planning it before , but I can suddenly improviously , or the most cortex .
And now , I can spend the whole sequence on the left the Siftable to the left the Siftable .
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is to build new interfaces and more and more soements as as well as our brain work and body .
And today , I had time to show you one of the result of this path , and some possibility we try to bring out of the lab .
The concept I want to transmitted you is that coming to this new generation of objects to interact with digital media , that will bring information in our world .
Thank you very much .
I don 't see the hour with you .
I 'm a writer .
I 'm going to be books is my profession , but it 's more than this , of course .
It 's also love and the fascination of my life .
And I don 't expect that it can change .
But , I said , something particular , something is succeeded in my life and in my career , that led me to rebrate the whole job with this work .
The particular thing is that I 've been wrote this book , this biography called " Mangia , Prega , " which , the diversity of my previous books , for some reason I did , and it became a great , bestseller , the international ,
And the result is that everywhere is now , people treat me as if I was convicted .
It 's true -- convicted , convicted .
They 're all worried by me , and they say , " Do you don 't care about it more than to do ?
You don 't care to keep writing for all life without being able to create a book that can important to someone ? "
that can be important to someone ? "
It 's certainly sure , you know .
But it could go worse , part of the one I remember that more than 20 years ago , when I began to say , I was an adolescent -- I wanted to be a writer .
I was going to inagainst the same reaction .
And people said , " Don 't you to have successful ?
Do you don 't care that the umillion of refuel , you know ,
You don 't care about all of life without anything about all life without anything about it ever ever out and die on a mule of dreams with the wild wild board to the wild to the wild , the wild of failing to walk the hiling wild to the failure ? "
So , you know .
The answer to all these questions is , " Yes . "
I 'm fear to all those things .
I 've always had fear .
And I also fear to many other things that people couldn 't have to be .
As the algains and other spent things .
But , as as much as I writing what I thought and I 'd say last multily is why ?
Is it rational ?
It 's logical that anybody has to expect to be spent from a work that I was born to do .
But what 's so particular in the impressive , creative , and it 's nervous to the mental health health care in a way that other carry don 't do ?
How my father , for example , he was a chemist engineer and I don 't remember one time in his 40 years of activity that was asked if it was a handful engineer ?
There was never -- that block of the John engineer John , how ?
It didn 't work so much , you know ?
Onestly , chemical engineers like not have certainly , in the centuries , guadagnated the reputation of being alcolized , you know ,
We have been writers , we have enough to have this reputation , and not just writers , but creative of any kind , we have this reputation of being enormous .
And it 's not the other that you look at the sad of the magnifments of the magnifments of the magnifments of the most people in the 21st century , they die young people .
And the ones that are not suicidata from their dones .
Norman Mailer , before he died , in the last interview said , " Every , my book , I 've killed a little more " an extraordinary affermation about the work of your life .
But we don 't beat when we feel these things that we 've heard these things so long long that we 've been completely interiorized and accepted the notion that creativity and suffering are somehow to read and the the art , in the end , the end , it will always have to the angod .
And the question I want to take all of today is : are you agreed with this idea ?
It 's good , because it 's also about this thing -- because it 's also about this way .
I think it 's hate .
And I think it 's dangerous and I don 't want to see the perpetuated in the next century .
I think it 's better to encourage our big creative minds .
And I certainly know that , in my case -- in my situation -- it would be very dangerous to start fire out of the dark , sudate the circumstances that are in my career .
It 's true -- you know , you 're pretty young , I 'm pretty young , I 'm pretty young , I 'm pretty young ,
I still have about four decades of work in me .
And it 's very likely that anything I writing in now , then it 's going to be judge from the world like the work that I had been going to have a successful succeeded .
I 'm going to slavewish , because we 're all more or less friends here -- it 's likely that my greatest success is my big succeeds .
Oh , Gesu , who thought !
You know , this is the kind of thinking that leads a person to start to bing in the morning and I don 't want to do that .
I would keep doing this work that we work .
So , the question is it , how ?
And so I think , after many reflective , that the way to work to keep writing is to create a psychological construction , OK ?
I have some way to find a deal distance of security between me , I 'm writing , and my natural anxial , which is writing , and I was trying to find other society , as I was trying to find other society to find other society , to find other society to see if they could have have some better ideas and more feel like to find other society to find if they could have have a better ideas and more sane ideas and more sane ane ideas and more sane ideas and more healthy healthy and more and more and feel like I feel like I
How to help people creative to manage people to manage the emotivity of creativity .
And that research has taken me to the Grek Grek and ancient Rome .
Seguitees because I 'm giving in the circle and then back .
In the ancient Greek and ancient Rome -- people didn 't seem to believe that creativity came from men , OK ?
It was thinking that creativity was this spirit looking at deal and that came to men from a few people distant and unknown , for a few distant and unknown , for distant reasons and knowledge .
The greaten were called these spirites of the spirites of creativity " demon . "
Socrate , wonderful , he believed to have a demon that elareas from far away from the far .
The Roomers were the same idea , but called the the kind of spirit .
That 's great , because the Roands didn 't think that a genius was particularly ,
They thought a genius was this kind of a devine of the devine that had literally living in the walls of an artist , a little like the elffo Dobby , and that came out of the artist , and I came out of hidden the work of the artist and models the result of that work .
Here 's the way -- here 's the distance of which I talk about -- that 's the psychological construction that protects you protects from your work .
And they all knew that was how it worked , right ?
So , antiks were protected by certain things , like , for example , the way the well-well-well-wiss , no ?
If your work was exceptional , you couldn 't take all the time , all of you know that the wirdly , all of you know that the incorporeous genius .
If your failed work , it was not all your failed , right ?
Everybody knew that was your genius to be a inable .
And so people han conceived people 's creativity in Occcient for a long time .
And then the Rinascement came and all changed , and all this great idea ; we put the human center of the universe above all the the the world of the universe above all the way of the universe on the winity .
This was the rational principle of the rational , and people started thinking that creativity came from the hydges .
And for the first time in history , you start to referred to this or artist as a rather than a genius , as a genius rather than a person with genius .
And I have to say , I think it was a big mistake .
I think that allow someone , a simple person to believe that being as a recipient as a recipient as a re-like , the human , and the source of all the deal , you know , unknown as a very large , unknown as a very large , a very large , you know , the human beings .
It 's like to ask someone to ingoiate the sun .
Demostly and destores completely the ego and creates all these ingestible expectations on performance .
And I think it was this pressure that I had been destroyed the artists in the past 500 years .
And if this is true , and I think that is , the question is , and now ?
Can we do that diversity ?
Maybe back to a more ancient understanding of the human relationship between human and mystery .
Or maybe not .
Maybe we can 't cell 500 years of thinking about a 18 minutes .
And there 's probably people in the audience that would be legitimate sospects on the notion of , so you know , they follow people to do with their projects .
I 'm not convinced you all about this thing .
But the question I 'd like to bring is , why no ?
Why don 't I think about this way ?
Because it 's more sense of everything that ever heard of the other thing that ever heard of the creative process .
A process that , as anybody ever ever tried to do something -- so , basically , all here -- you don 't understand , you know , you don 't compories .
And in fact , it can sometimes be completely paranormal .
I did this inagainst recently with the extraordinary poetry Stone , who has now 90 years , but that 's been a poetry for all life and told me that during his childhood in the rural Virginia , working out in the camps , and feel it , in if a poem was coming from , when a poem was a poem was coming from the landscape .
He said , he was like a fragorous train of the air .
And that was rotolding to her from the landscape .
It was feeling , because he was to tremare the earth under his feet .
He knew I had one thing to do , and it was of words , " Web as a matta . "
And so it 's going to go to the house and was infollowed by this poem , and it wouldn 't have to get a piece of paper and a match of enough , as the trapart , and rate on the page .
Sometimes he couldn 't be fast enough , so it 's going to be fast enough , so it 's going to get to home and the poem the poem , and the poem would continue to return through the landscape , trying to get through the landscape , trying , as a poem . "
And then there were those times -- this piece 't that , I 'm never going to say -- there were the moments where the almost losing , OK ?
So , he was running at home and she was trying to card and the poem was looking through , and he was made a math in the way , and then he was going , and then he said , " that was like if you slow with the other hand and the steffee .
And he had the poem from the coda and reputting it in his body and transclud on the page .
And in these cases , the poem would be presented on the perfect page and intact , but the contrary , from the last word to the first .
So when I heard it , I heard about -- it 's very excited , it 's exactly the same as my creative process .
I don 't all my creative process -- I 'm not a construct !
I 'm a mulo , and my way to work is ; you know , I 'm going to get up and working and go through the goffee , and I 'm going to get up .
But even I , in my aggin , I have striped the thing , sometimes .
And I guess that many of you who 's han .
You know , even though the work and ideas came to me from a certain source , you can 't honestly know .
And what is this thing ?
And how can we relate to it in a way that we don 't lose the head , but rather , that makes us sani ?
And as I 'm about , the best example , I have a Meran musician , which I have interviewed sewhere I interviewed several years ago for a newspaper .
We were talking about this , and you know , Tom , for the most of life was the incarnation of the life , the most of the life of the areas of the artist tomental impulses .
But then he invecent , he cut up , and one day , he was driving on a Los Angeles , changed all for him .
He was going to be fast and all of a traits of a feeling framment , that 's coming in in his head as an inspiration , elusive , and the wild , and the wants , you know , it 's wonderful , and the desider , but it 's not how to take it .
It 's not a piece of paper , it doesn 't have a matt , it 's not a recorder .
So , I started to feel this kind of old species of old old , " I 'm going to lose , and I 'm going to remarried to the sessionate , and I 'm going to handed by this song , and I 'm going to remarried by this song , and I 'm going to start out of this song , and I 'm going to remared by this song , and I 'm going to sessentially sessed by this sessionated
I 'm not good enough and I can 't do it . "
And instead of going to go to the panic , he stopped .
He was a whole new .
He just just the sky and said , " Scell , you know , I 'm not driving ? "
" Who looks like to write a song now ?
If you really want to exist , you 're going to get me a little bit more opporting .
At , you go to importantly somebody else today .
I went to the Leonard Cohen . "
And his process worked changed after this .
It wasn 't the work , the work was still dark as well .
But the process , and the anxiety anxiety that was requed when the genius , the genius that was a genius of him , and the genius that was going to get rid of the other things that was , because he was doing that , he had not to be a thing , and it was remajor .
But it 's a peculiar , wonderful bizarre collaboration between Tom and this strange and the outside of Tom and this strange and outside that it was not Tom .
So , how the felt that story started to change a little bit , the way I worked and already save me a time .
This idea , I had to save me when I was writing , " Ama , " and fall in one of those cave of the disperation that we 're all working on something and we 're not able to think that 's going to be a disaster , which is going to be a disaster , which is going to be the worst book .
Not just bad , right , the worst book I wrote .
And I started thinking about giving this project .
But then I remember about Tom who talked to the air and I tried to us .
So I went to my face on the dark of the dark , and I would take my common to a vacuum of the room .
And I said to the high voices , " Sents , what , you 're going to be the wouldn 't be brilliant , no , it 's not going to be good , no ?
Because as I 'm putting all of what I have , I don 't have this .
So if you want to be better , you have to presentarts and do your part .
Okay . But if you don 't do it , you know what , I don 't do anything .
I 'm going to writing the same because it 's my work .
And I 'd like to do my part of the today I 'm presented to do my part , " Because , then , then , OK -- I mean , OK --
And they were always magnifes , because the ballerins were professionals and were great .
But every time , rarely , something happened , and one of these artists became actually transformed .
And I know you know what I 'm talking about , because I know you all seen , at a point , a performance so .
It was like the time , and the dancer walk through a kind of land-upon a land-a-and-up , like 1,000 night , and it was all of the way , and it was all all of it .
And suddenly , not appear as a human .
But it 's accese from the divinity of divinity .
And when this happened , the temples , people knew what was , they called him .
They had their hands and began to dotar , " Allah , Allah , God , God God , " God , God , " God , "
That 's God , you know .
And the historic note -- when the Mori invaded the Spain , I was this abitude with them and the pruncles changed in the centuries of the " Allah , Allah , " in " Ole , Allah , " " in " Ole , " that you can still feel in the corries or in the flamp .
In Spain , when an artist did something impossible and magic , " Allah , the , Allah , the great , I was a great , I was a little , I 'm a little bit , it 's a last thing , the God .
And it 's great because we need .
But , the problem comes the day , for the dancer , the houses , when you 're wake up and discovering that are the 11 in the morning of Martedesesday and the last of God .
It 's just a mortal with gran evil , and maybe it 's not going to be able to make that altitude .
And maybe nobody will the name of God still , and what does it have to do with the rest of his life ?
It 's hard .
This is one of the most painful recognized to a creative life .
But maybe it doesn 't have to be so angoscious if you can 't believe , as much more extraordinary , that the most extraordinary aspects of your being from yourselves .
But you might just have to you have data in prested by an inimaginable source of this team , part of your life that you have to go with somebody else .
And , you know , if we think that 's all changes .
And so I started thinking about , and it 's certainly as I thought of several months in the work of the book that I 'm going to have soon , the dangerous , I 'll attesissively followed , attesissively followed in my green succeful .
And what I have to keep tell me when I feel electured by this is , it 's not not doing .
It 's not just your work . It 's just your work .
Continua presentarts for your part , any can be .
If your work is dancing , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know ,
If the divine , I assurd to you a decide to leave some kind of wonderful , for a moment through your efforts , for a moment through your efforts , then , then , " Ole ! "
Ether ther , you do the same your dance .
And it 's " Ole ! " at you yes the same .
I think , and I think it 's supposed to teach it .
" Ole ! " You know , just for us , even for having human love and testing tals to make you continue to make you continue .
Thank you .
Thank you .
June Cohen : Ole !
And as you know , I 've already talked about some of these projects on the human genome , what can mean , and the discovery of the genes of genes .
We 're starting a new performal , we started digitalize biology and now we 're going to go from that digital code we 're both in a new biology , designing and synthizing life .
We always tried to bring great questions .
" What 's life ? " It 's something that many biologists have tried to understand varareas .
We tried different approaches , reduced to minimi terms .
We 're digitizens by almost 20 years .
When we sequenced the human genome was treated to go from the analome of biology in the world of the computer world .
Now we ask ourselves : can we regenerate life , or create new life from this digital universe ?
This is the map of a small organism , the Mycoplasma genitalium , which is the smallest genitalium between those that can authorean ,
And we tried to reduce the genome to create a little bit more smaller .
We are able to eliminate a hundred genes of genes about about 500 .
But when we look at his mapolic map , it 's relatively simple respect to our .
I believe me , this is simple .
But when we look at all the genes that we can eliminate , one at the time , it 's very unlikely that this can bring a living cells .
So we decided that the only way to progrew to proof it was synthize this chromosoma way that we could modify the components to bring some of these fundamental questions .
And so we started the adventure of " Can we can synthesize a chromosoma ? "
Can the chemistry confeed to produce these big molecules that we never had to create before now ?
And , in case , we can make a chromosoma ?
A chromosoma is just a piece of material , inert material .
The speed we are able to digitalize life is growing up to exponential life is growing up .
Our ability to write the genetic code , instead , progree rather slowly , but it 's improving .
And our most recently results the results of the exponential curve .
We started over 15 years ago .
The process of required many passages , starting with a bioethic re-view required , first experiments .
But we found that synthize DNA is very difficult .
There are tens of thousands of machines in the world that producing little segments of DNA , the longer of 30 lect--generative process : the more the segment is longer , the most mistakes are .
So we had to develop a new method to make these framments and correcreceive the mistakes .
And this was our first attempting to go from the digital genome , from the Phi of the Egenome of the Phi 174 .
It 's a small virus that kills bacteria .
We designed the fragments , we actually did the correction of the mistakes and get a molecule of DNA molecule .
The interesting part is when we took this piece of inhert chemical material , and we insered it in the bacteria , the bacteria have started reading this genetic code and produring the viral particles .
The viral particles have left from the cells , they 're back and destroyed the Eccles .
I talked about recent with members of the oil industry , and it 's saying , that they 're certainly compressive .
They have more than you .
We believe this is a situation where the software can really build his same hardware in a biological system .
But we wanted to do things in the big things .
We wanted to build the entire chromosoma .
I 'm more than 580 miles of the letters of genetic code .
So we thought of building it in the cassets of viruses , so that we can change the cassets that we can change the cassets of a living cells .
The design is crucial , and if we start with digital information in a computer , these have to be very accurate .
When we sequenced this genome for the first time in 1995 , the wandard was a mistake for every 10 miles .
We found out , we would resequencency , 30 errors . If we had that original sequence never be able to do it work .
One part of the process is designing over 50 lecking around the other board segments that are with all the other segments of 50 lectops to build subunity smaller that working together .
We 're going to try to the only here .
You probably read that we read that we insert in the filifty .
Think of this this : we have a genetic code based on four letters : An , G and TG .
Three of those letters together with about 20 adicals , and there 's a specific order to read for every fright-of-ly-acid fright-to-ammas .
So we can use the genetic code to write words , frasases , thinking .
What we did in the beginning was autographed .
Some of the fact that it wasn 't poem .
We designed these segments to just just just to get them to me with enzymes .
There are entertainment that they reppair them and put them on .
And we started assembling with the parts , starting with five to seven to seven mile , and then you get to the leck segments in a way to get 72 , and they had a single leck to them to get 72 miles .
We have these segments in abundance so that we 're trying to do this from a tune processing that we 're trying to create a very robustopistopiss -- as you 'll see in a minute .
We 're trying to automatize the process .
So , this seems the tabellone of the basket .
When we get these very long , more than 100 miles , the more than 100 miles , they 're not going to grow in the Ecccles .
It 's the limits of modern biology .
So we 've been looking at other mechanisms .
We knew about another mechanism called recombination omologa , which in biology is using a DNA to repair the DNA to repair the deal .
Here 's an example .
This organism , called the Deinococcus radiodurans , it can absorry three million radiodurans .
You can see in the superior re-like square , as his chromosoma is destroyed .
In 12 , 24 hours comes replaced exactly as it was before .
There are thousands of organisms that are able to do that .
These organisms can sit completely .
They can live under empty .
I 'm absolutely that life exists in space , and you feel to find new environments of water .
I mean , NASA showed that this is .
This is an image of molecule that we built by using these processes , just using the lights with the design of appropriate segments from inserable .
The likely self-assembled them .
This picture was not taken with a microscope , but with a microscope , but with a microscope .
It 's a molecule so big that we can see the way with a light microscope .
These are pictures that are doing a period of about six seconds .
This is the publishing that we did a little time ago .
I 'm more than 580,000 lectarms .
It 's the largest molecule of a defined structure ever created by man .
It 's got a molecular weight in 300 million .
If you stamong a career to a 10 without spaces , we 'd like 142 pages only to transcriver this genetic code .
Now , how do we work ? How do we activate it ?
Obviously , you tramed a virus is a game from kids .
It 's a little more complicated when they use bacteria .
It 's easier when it 's eucariote cells as our : you can just extract the nuclear and insert another , which is basically the process of clonation .
In the archaaea parts the chromosoma is , but we 've been recently demonstrated that we 're able to do a complete translating chromosoma from one cell to another and activity .
We can have a chromosoma by a microbial species .
The two are different as men from the topes .
We added some gene more in a way that we can decide what to this chromosoma .
The skies , the skies in the enjoymes that you can kill all the proteins .
And when we put it in cells in cells was stupendownes -- and you will appreciate our damothowned -- the new chromosophisticatopic .
And we were thinking that we couldn 't go beyond , but we had any of the way to spinger .
This is one of the major mechanisms .
We found that a lot of species have added a second , or a third chromosoma somewhere , adding in a second thousand new tracks to that species .
So who thinks about evolution as a only gene of the gene , that 's not the way of biology .
They 're going to be called " restriction , " that I know , they 're going to digest the DNA .
The chromosoma that was in cells , not one .
The cellular cell the chromosoma that we have inserito--shake .
It 's expressed , and recognized the other crumosoma as an expressed material , the masticated , and we 've got all all the cells and the new chromosoma .
It became blue because of the genes we 've insered .
And in a short lasses of time , all the characteristics of a species are gone , and you transformated all in a new species , based on the new software that we 've inserted in cells .
All the proins have changed , the members have changed , and when we read the genetic code , exactly how we 've transfted the genetic code exactly what we 've transfted .
Now , this might seem alchemy genetic , but altering the software , we can change the things in a way enough enough .
Now , I 've already explained that here is not talking about genesesis -- but of progress from three million years and a half million years , and I said that maybe we 're going to create a new version of Cambrian explosion , where we 're going to create new species on this digital process .
Why do that ?
I think it 's pretty obvious when we think about our necessity .
We 're going to go from six billion and a half billion people in the next 40 years .
Right for example , I was born in 1946 .
Now there are three people on the planet for each , in 1946 , there are four .
We 're having problems now to find food , fresh water and a lot of food , and well-to-and-a-half billion people .
It 's even more than we do it for nine billion .
We use more than five billion , more than five billion carbon , more than 30 billion baries .
That means a million baries a day .
When we try to find biologists , or any kind of process to replaced them , it 's going to be a huge challenge .
We have to keep the whole of the all emission of CO2 from these materials that are going to end in the atmosphere .
At the day of today , because of the scientific discoveries in all the world , we have a database with about 20 million genes , and I like to think that are the future of the future .
The electronics , it 's only a dozen of about components , and think about how many different things are coming out .
Our limitations here are the data here , we 're the reality of our imagination .
Now we have a techniques , because of these rapid metods of synthetization , in order to create what we call combined genomics .
We 're able to build a big robot that can produce a million chromosomes a day .
Think of processing these 20 million genes or to try to get the other people , or to get to produce either or drugs , new vaccines , we can change , new vaccines , we can change , and create more biology now in the last 20 years of science .
And it 's just a standard selection .
We can choose for the possibility of survival , chemical production or carbon , production ,
This is an instantaneal of software programmed that we 're working on to be able to several and designing species on the computer .
Well , we don 't need it .
We know exactly the genetic code .
We 're four-generation of fourth generation .
You know , you know , you can extract ethanol was an experiment .
We have carbon on , and third generation that are going to use enough to the sugar carbon didium , as the eight-carbon , as the eight-different kinds of butanol .
But the only way the biology can have a great impact impact without increasing more than food , and limitary the cost of food and limitary would transformate the CO2 in matter before , so we 're working on design cells that can achieve the first carbon , we 're thinking of being able to have the first carburts in about 18 months .
The solar light solar light with the CO2 is a metodo-- but in our discoveries , we found different metods .
This is a organism that we have described in 1996 .
It 's about 2,500 feet of the deep ocean , at about 2,500 feet of the water .
They create metane from CO2 to use hydrogen molecular as energy .
We 're trying to understand if we can incanalate the CO2 , which can easily be transformed through tubes , convertire that CO2 in carbon , to drive this process .
So , we might think we might be able to increase what we could be able to increase what life is . " We , " What 's the life " Noi , real , we have the goal to replaceal oil industry .
Exactly . If you can 't do that from TED , where can you ?
It would be a main energy source .
And also , we 're working for using the same metods to create vaccines .
You saw this year with flu with flu , we always go back to a year and a dollar , when it 's about find the right vaccine .
I think that that 's building vaccines in ancient advvaccines in ancient an anticipous .
So , this is how the future could start looking at , now , the tree of evolution , accelerating evolution with the synthetic bacteria , areas , and infinentially cells .
We are so from the improving people .
Our purpose is to do a way of living enough to try to do it . Thank you very much .
I 'll show you , the most quickest , the most quickest , some fundamental , the new technology that we took to Microsoft a year ago . This is Seadragon .
It 's a environment where you can interact is at local level that remote with a huge amount of data data visual data .
We 're seeing a lot of gigabyte of digital phoom with a kind of zoom , and the wild , for a fast , and the wind , and we have the images like we want .
And it doesn 't matter how big the amount of information that we see , how big these things are the data , or the images .
Most are common photographs , but this for example , is a scanning from the Library of the Congress , and recently recently in the gamel of 300 megaxing .
It doesn 't make any difference because the only thing that you know , the prestations of a system like this is the number of pixel on your screen in any time . It 's also very flexible architecture .
This is a whole book , example of data , not of images .
This is the Casa desolate of Dickens . Every colonn .
To show you that it 's just about textbook , we can do something like that , to actually see that it 's a real real real representation of the textbook , not a picture .
It could be a little artificial way to read a electronic book .
Not advice .
This is an example of the most realistic . It 's a number of the Guardian .
Every image of a big thing .
And it really gives you the pleasure of reading the real version of reading the real version of a quotidian , which is for a molteplant , which is for a molteplice .
We also did something with the corner of this particular number of the Look in particular ,
We created a higher advertising , and we 've created a higher advertising -- much more higher than what you use in a normal advertising -- and we inserted to the extra .
If you want to see the characteristics of this automobile , you can see here .
Or other models , or even the specific specific ,
And this really , really , the exhibition of these ideas to eliminate space on the screen .
We hope that this means to put a lot of the pop-up , and other porcheries , and more and similar , not to be necessary .
Of course , the map is one of the most obvious applications for this kind of technology .
And I don 't want to lose time , if we don 't say we have contribute to give them to this field .
These are all the streets in the U.S. sovil in the U.S. geospacecraspace ,
So , we 're going to do something else .
This is actually actually , from the vial Web ; you can go to see it .
It 's a project called Photosynthy , which combine two different technologies .
One is Seadragon and the other is a visual computer , in a very interesting computer computer that we did by Noah Snavely , a student of the University of the UW Seitz Rick Seitz 's Microsoft Rick Szeliski Microsoft Rick Szi . "
And it 's from the vial Weadragon .
You can see it when we do this kind of screens , where we can go from an image to the other image to the other image of the experience of the last multiple .
But the space collocation of the images here has actually meaning .
The algoriththms of computers have recorded these images together , so that they have all the images -- so that you know , all of the things that I imagine -- all of the way you know , the Montagne Rocckets , you 're scated . Here we know . Here we give you a slide , and these things are all the way of a slide , and these things are all connected to panoric , and these things are all related to the space .
I don 't know if I have time to show you some other environment .
There are a few more space .
I want to go directly to one of the original data from Noah-- and this comes from a previous prototype of Photosynthesus that we 've done for the first time , we 've done the first time , to show you what I think is really the key to show you what I think is really the key to show you what I think is really the key to look at the environments we have put in the website .
We had to worry some of the legal aspects of legal things and forth .
This is a re-building re-building cattedral of Notre Dame images from Flickr . Basta digites . And you get images of types of these areas as as a magic field , other of these conants conts a picture that 's discovery , immedium , which is discovered to this model .
So they 're all images from Flickr and they were all connected to the space in this way .
And it 's possible to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to navigate in this very simple way .
You know , I never thought to end to work for Microsoft .
It 's very gratification to get this kind of acafe here .
I think you can see that it 's a lot of different kinds of fotowards cameras : from the cell phones of the SLR , a number meaning , a number of meaning , put together in this environment .
And if I can , I try to look at those more strange .
And there are a lot of are faces by faces , etc .
It 's somewhere where there 's a series of photographs -- there .
This is a poster of Notre Dame registrated .
We can go from the poster to the physics of this environment .
The essential point is that we can do things with social environment . This is now taking data from the interest memory of how it looks like the earth of the world , from view -- and connected to all those data together .
All those pictures become connected together , the major of the parts .
You have a model of the earth of the earth .
Think about this as a prolungation of Stephen Lawler on Earth .
It 's something that grows in complexity as people use it , and the people who use it , and the advantages to increase with the use .
Their pictures are marced with inseres by other people .
If somebody comes the idea of contradicate all these things , say , the name of the name , my cheathedral of all of those data , and I can use all those data , and I can use the point of all those data , and I can use the pictures of the space , in that metapuniverse , using the photos of a cross-out of a cross-user experience .
Of course , a consequence of all this is , virtual models , all the interesting part of the earth , the most interesting things that you might have an airplane and similar images , and similar images , but from the memory .
Thank you very much .
Chris Anderson : I understand ? What what your software is that your software is that , in the next few years , all the time in the next years , all of the world 's going to be practically connected with ?
BAA : Yeah . What 's doing is doing is basically , you know ,
It 's creating hyperlink , if you want , in the images .
And it 's doing it in the basis of the images .
The thing is very interesting if you think about wealth of the information semantes that many of these images .
As when you 're a research of images on the Web , you digits a frase and the texture on the web page has a lot of information about the picture .
Now , what if that picture is connects all your pictures ?
So the amount of interconnection , semantics and the amount of richness that came up with it . It 's a very big classic .
CA : Blaise , it 's really amazing . Compliments .
BAA : I thank you very much .
One of the most lights when you travel and one of the ethnographics of the ethnographics is the living between who has no longer forgods , the antial tradiers , you touch the wind , you touch out of the wind , you touch from the rain , you want to leverage from the rain , the wind , the wind the plants .
Basters thinking that the sciamans Jaguar vide still beyond the Via Lattea , or the Meanthropology , or the Himalayas , or the Himalayas , the budddists still the respire of the anththropology of the anththropology , and that the idea that the world that the world in which we live in a way we live , but it 's just a model of reality ,
the consequence of a particular adaptative choices that our estrace has done , well , well , many generations ago .
And of course , we all share the essential tracts .
We all procreating .
We are subjects to start .
We have to deal with the inexorability of death , so we don 't surprise if we 're going to be like we 're paying .
We all have an art .
What 's the particular one of the song , the song of the dance of every culture .
It 's not the people who are the Penan forests of the Borneo , or the following Vodoo 's the Wodoo 's the Kenya Sepepeptentrial , the Curander , the Curander 's Curander , or a cammboils in the Shara .
He was my journey from the desert a month ago , or a month ago , or a yak in the valule of the Wewalls of the world .
All of these people teaches us that are other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , other ways of moving in the world .
And if you reflect a moment , it 's a concept that it can give you hope .
Insilver , the myriades of the world creating a spiritual life of the world , and cultural life that 's important for the well-being , and it 's important for the well-being as a biosphere .
And you can think of this cultural ragnostic , as an etnosphere , and you can call the extra ethnosphere , the nosphere , the ideas , dreams , ideas , inspirations , inspirations , intuitions , inspiration ,
The etnosphere is the fantastic patriage of humanity .
It 's the symbole of what we 're and what we can be in how inquisitive species .
And because the biosphere was gravly as as well as well as it was as well as well as well as it was as quickly as quickly as well as well .
Nowned biologist , for example , it would say that 50 percent of all the species was or the winditation of the simply extra , because of the most apocalm , the most apocalm of biological diversity -- and not even close to the most optimistic -- that 's the most optimistic -- that 's the cultural diversity .
The index of all , of course , the language .
When you were born 6,000 languages on this planet .
A language is not only composal by a vocabulary or a series of rules .
A language is the sprayon the human spirit .
It 's the middle of the animal of every culture comes in the world .
Every language is a forest of mind , a backin , a thought , a winner , a thought , an ecosystem of the spiritual .
And of those 6,000 languages , as we are here in Monterey , at least the half the hases are no longer to be surring in the orecchies of children .
They 're not teaching children , the people who mean , less that 's not not , something that are already death .
What 's more sad than being availed by silent , of being the last to talk a language , not have a way to move the wisdom of the wisdom of the children ?
This is a faight in some of the world every two weeks : every two weeks , a year , a send , and it 's going to hold the tomble of the tombs of the ancient language .
And I know that somebody 's going to say , " isn 't it much better ?
The world would not be a better place if we all talk about the same language ? " Well , then we talk all talk about yoruba .
We talk about kogs .
You will have a suck thing to be able to talk about your language .
I 'd like to do a journey through the thnosphere --
a small journey in the etnosphere to give you a bunch of what we 're losing .
Many of us forget that when I say , " different ways of exists , " I mean , very different ways of exists .
We take for example , the Barasana , in the settle-settle-settle-hand-up , the popular population , which creates the myth of sandwers .
It 's a popular popular that 's not able to distinguish the blue color from the green , because the time you were identified in the forest , which depends on the forest , which depends on the popular .
They have a strange language and a regulation of the major , called an existic language , " " " You have to marry a different language .
All this has radical in the past mitological , supply , the particularity is that in these families , so they 're talking about six or seven language because of matrimons mysters , nobody print .
They 're limited to listen and then start talking .
We take one of the most interesting tribes I lived , the Waorans of Ecuador , the Waorans of Eastern , an incredible popular population that has had the first contacts in 1958 .
In 1957 five missionaries have been trying to do a deal mistake .
They had done by photographs that they had never seen anything that would have seen a friend of a plug forest , forest that this population of the pluvial forest .
They collected the picture from the earth , they 've been spring a shape or a shape , and not finding anything , they 'd concluded that they were treated with the horders .
But the Waorans didn 't kill the strange .
They killed them between them .
54 percent of the mortality was caused by their same .
We were eight-generations , and we found two death death , and when we insight to know , they had a lot of them , they had an invectually invecent , and then they 'd killed him him .
The hunters were able to recognize the animal urine from 40 steps and recognize the species .
In the early ' 80 , I had been assigned a very interesting task when my Harvard professor asked me if I wanted to go to Haiti to Haiti to the basic wild society of the power of Duvalier and Tonton Macoutes , and embrbryser of the poison , and I embrbrbrbryed the board of the ards .
And to give a sense of the miracolder , I would have to understand the Vodoo culture .
It 's pretty much about a complex , a metaphical vision of the world .
It 's interesting .
If I ask you to tell you the great religions of the world , what would you say ?
Cristianesimum , Islam , Buddism , Ebraism , etc .
A continent is always left out , thinking that Africa has no religious feels . And yes and the Vodoo , and the Vodoo 's not the other that the distilside of these religious concepts in the tragic tragic concepts of the slavism .
What makes the interesting voodoo is the intend of life and death .
So , the vision they can be able to be the spirits .
The spirites can be invoced by the Great the Great the wild , they respond to the dance and they replace the temporary , the way that for a short way that for a short short of the wild .
So , the voodooists love to say , " You white , you go to the God .
We say , we 're going to say , " We say God . "
And from the moment you 're rid , is the spirit that you guid , how can you do it ?
So you might have these incredible events : follow vote in the state of trance that touch impuntizing , that you 're impuntized , a demonstration of the power of the mind when it 's catalyzed in a state of extreme .
And all the people I lived with the most extraordinary of the Sierra Nevada Santa Marta , in the Sierra Nevada Santa Marta , in the Santa Marta , in the Santa Marta ,
It was descending of the ancient , that once once they lived on the caraibia , the people who were living on the conquatic plane , the people were ring on the vulcanic massive plants .
In a drug of blood continent , this popular is never conquent from the Spanish .
But there are now now now , they 're an extraordinary , but their formation is very extraordinary .
The young people who are landed by the families to three or four years , and live sitting in a world of buy buy buy buy , in a world of the rain of the glaciers for 18 years .
Two douball of nine years choices to reproduce the nine months of the demands that they transformed in the user of the mother , now are metaphorically in the uter of the Grank Mother .
So , this time , they 're acculturated to the values of their society , values that predict that their prayers are the construction , they 're going to make the conmic balance -- or to say the equilibrium ,
At term of this incredible initiation , they 're suddenly outside and for life , 18 years , they see an alba . And in that active consciousness of the first butter , when the sun is the value of the beautiful landscape , all of the bey-flip , all the way that has learned in theory . And the prey a step . And it 's just a step . And it 's saying , it 's the payer , it 's just a step back and say , "
" Where ? I said , " I said , "
It 's study . Now it 's about you protect it . "
They call the greater brothers and say that we , the minors of the destruction of the world .
This is a level of intuition is extremely important .
When we think about the Ingene populations and invote the environment and the old story of the wild noble , that 's a concept of self-invoicyst in his simplicity or magarm .
Ingene popular people are not as feeling as as an ethes as a nostalgia .
There 's no space for these things in the drugs of the Asmallat the wind of Tibet , but thank you for time and the ritual , and the rituals , they created a mystics of the Earth 's nearly un-like , but on an intuition of the Earth can only live because it 's infused by consciousness , the concept that the Earth can only live because it 's infused by consciousness .
What does it mean ?
It means that a girl of Ande who grow up the mountain , which is a spirit of the Mountain is a spirit of the Montana , which is going to be a different human being being being a different human being being a different deep with the mountain that 's a different mountain of the Montana that grow 's a friend of rock , it 's a friend of rock , you 're going to be a boy .
That 's the dimora of a spirit or a mineral cabulous .
What 's interesting is the metaphor that defines the report between the individual and the natural world .
I grew up in the forests of the Columbia credary that the forests to be cut .
And this resist of my friends Kwautl friends who believe that the forests are the Hukukuk and the babies of the paradise and the babial bis that living in the world , we 're living in the world , we 're going to live in the Hatsa , the spirits that are living in the Hatsa .
If you start to look at that these cultures can create reality , you can start understand some sense of their sense .
I took this picture of aprile in the nordoccclusters .
Mayahuash , some of you heard of the ayahuash , the most powerful psycotive ,
What makes it fascinating the ayahuash is not the potential of the substance , but his elaboration . It 's composed by two elements .
On the side , this lian lian legacy series of carboline , harmful and harmolines , harmolines , slightly hills .
I take the only plants , you have a bluster , which is a little bit the consciousness , but it 's measured with the leaves of a coffee of the coffee family said Psychathy said Psychotridis .
This plants contains powerful triptamines , very similar to serotonin , dimethoxtamine-5 , methoxtamine .
If you ever see Yanomami , you 'll get Yanomami to the nose the stance that do from a different species , anches it contains a different species , anches contains .
Tiring that polust on the nose is a little bit like being disparated by a card of dipink , and land on a wild of electricity . [ Risate not creates a distorsion of reality .
I was often a lot of with my professor , Richard Evan Shultes , the man who has taken the psychedelical , with his discovery , with his discovery , with his discovery of the fabinhorries in the ' 30s .
I think my tesis , you can 't classifying these tripptamines as hallucinated as a hallucinated .
It 's possible to take the orally only if you assually advancing with other chemicals that dens .
Now it 's the beautiful : Is , the becomes to this lian lian lian elian , of the same kind of necessary to potential the tripptamines . The question surveil : in a flap of 80,000 species , like these people are living people , like these people are not like these people , are not like these people , they 're not like these people , they 're like these people , create a biochemist , which is soil , they create a real supper soil of the parts ?
We use the great eufemism of the proof of the proof the proof the proof infrual , that can reveal .
But if we ask the Indian , they 'll tell us , " The plants are talking about . "
What does it mean ?
This tribes , the Cofan , has 17 variety of ayahuasks , who are nice in the forest , and that our eyes would get into the forest .
If we ask them , how they 'll say , " I said , " I said , " I 'd say , " I 'd understand it 's plants , and the rest of the rest , you don 't know all ? "
The solution is : you take the 17 variety variety of a land-to-night , and each one will cantery with a different tone .
With this doesn 't have in Harvard , but it 's much more interesting that we count the stones .
Now , [ applaushes ] the problem is that even the ones of us who have to heart people find them peewings are , they find paintoresks , but somehow reducts in the history of our real world , and pass .
In fact , the 20th century , in 300 years , it 's not going to remind his gueres or innovations , but rather as the one was where we stopped and actively actively accepted or the passively , the destruction of biological diversity and cultural diversity of the planet . Now the problem is not change .
All cultures through the centuries of life .
And the problem is not technology .
The Indian Sioux , they don 't know to be Sioux when they put in the archief and they recent as as the American American , they don 't have stopped to be Americans when they put in the horse and calm .
It 's not the change or the technology that threatening the wildness of the etnosphere . It 's the power .
The domination flight flight .
And if you give a look at the world , you 'll find that these are not destinated cultures .
They 're living and living dynamic creatures out of the hyperformance from the forces of hyperformance that go beyond their adaptation .
I 'm a deboscing in the pathries of the Penan --
a popular notion of Sarawak , in the waste , a popular popular that lights lights in the forest to a generation , and now reduced to the servitus , where you can see the inner , where you can see the inquinquin-butter-out of the lights that seems to be able to Mar Cinese , where the Meridian , where the southern Mar Cinese , where the horizonte , where the horizonte ,
With the wood wood to fests the wood dream with the forest .
Or , in the case of Yanomami are the disease that came with the discovery of the gold .
If we move on on the Tibet , where I 'm doing a lot of research , you 'll see the hard of the political domination .
As you know the genocide , the physics of a popular popular , is constructed to the universal level , but the ethnocide , the destruction of life , not just not just as a popular popular , not just a popular , but I advvvanced in certain environments , because it 's part of the development .
And you can 't understand the suffering of Tibet until the beginning .
I 've been there in 6,000 miles from Chengdu in China through Tibet , through Tibet , and I got to Lhasa young college , and I got to Lhasa young college , I realized what 's behind the statistics we feel .
6,000 moved sacres in the dust and cenjoy .
1.2 million people killed by the military , in the Cultural Rivolution .
The father of this guy was ascritical at Panchen Lama .
It means that it was killed to the temple of the Chinese invasion .
Hey , the deal was in Santity during the diaspora that has taken the popular in Nepal .
Her mother was imprigioned and his colpe was being rich .
It was taken of hidden in the age of two years from the age of two years , hidden under his gonna because he couldn 't live without him .
The sister , which did the same , it was mitted in reducation .
A day he inavailable day a window , a wild fascinating Mao and , for this transgression , was mitted to the work for seven years .
The Tibet 's pain of Tibet can be inherred , but the recenter of the people is from tener .
At the end , all of it , you reduce to a choice .
We want to live in the world world 's world 's the world 's pologist , or we want to acail the world pologist ?
The great anthropologists Margaret Mead , before he said that his biggest fear was that , in our way to go to this view of the world , we 're not just going to see the whole graw of the human imagination reduced a limitation of thinking , but one day , we 're going to see from a sleep , and we 're going to get from a sleep , and we 're going to be a chance .
And it 's umillion people remember that our species is existing for 60,000 years .
The Neolitics , who made us the agriculture , which made us underwater , which made us underfight us to the seme of the smoman , that the poem of the smong , creating the prosa of the specialization , and we talk about 10,000 years ago .
The modern world 's industrialized has 300 years .
That 's the story that we 're not suggests that we have the answers to all the challenges we have to do in the millennia to come .
When these myriades of the world is asked what it means to be human , they respond to be human , they respond with a different voices .
And it 's in these answers that we all all have the chance of being what we are : a conscious species , that has to do so that all the people and all the garbs can fall the people and the garbs can fall . And there are great moments of it .
I took this picture of the northerthertherthertherthertherthern island , when I went to the whales with the Inuit , and this man , Olaya , Olaya , Olaya , the fact of his grandfather .
The canadese government was not always given to the Inuit 's population , and in the ' 50s to stabilish our suprematic , we gave them in colonies .
The grandfather of this man refuted to go .
The family , I teming for his life , and he took them all the behind .
You have to know that Inuit doesn 't temon the cold , they use it .
The slitters of slitters were made of fish were made of fish with the skin .
The grandfather of this man didn 't have to intight from the night or the libraries that was suffering .
It 's sgattaighted , you have the pantalone in the skin and defecated in your hand . When you did it , you know , the flew , the worked creating a lama .
It 's sprailed salive on the points of this coltelem of this cut cut up and he came solid , he killed a dog .
It 's a sleep , and created a brighter , with the cassa re-made a slethtter , and it 's disappear to the bchisa , and it 's disappeared on the bchisa , you can ck up .
We want to talk about cavarself-wild with nothing ? [ Resated ] And this , in different ways , [ Applaushers ] .
In 1999 , the canadvance , the canadvance has redated by the Inuit 's total control of an area of the largest California and Texas mitted .
It 's the new pathy . It 's called Nunavut .
It 's an independent territory . They 're all the resources .
One splendido example of how a natione-state can recognize with his popular .
And , finally , I think it 's pretty obvious at least in those remote , and I realized that they 're not remote in these remote aren 't remote remote .
For somebody 's house .
They representing several human imagination that are rising at the time . And for all of us , the dreams of these children , as the dreams of our children , become part of the wild , they become part of the hope .
From , we know , National Geographic , we convinced that the politicians will never get anything .
We believe that the polemies --
[ Applausi ] are not persuasive , but we believe that stories can change the world , and maybe we 're the best institution to tell the stories of the world . Every month of our site has to get 35 million visits .
156 countries transmitted our television canal canal canal canal .
Our rivers are thual lesses from millions .
Our work is traveling in the ethnosphere to bring our audience in beautiful places that are going to go through the main places that are going to be able to have seen as , and hopefully , habel the world 's world , and we have to find a life style , and we have to find a life in a plural world of life in a plural and multicultural tal , and multicultural ticultural , and multicultural , and multicultural , and the bultural world ,
where all the people wisdom of all people can contribute to our well-being collective well-being .
Thank you .
I 'm going to talk about some things I wrote in this book that I hope I 'm going to be called the other than any of you 've heard and proverse to the connections , in case , you wouldn 't notice .
I want to start with what I call " the official dogma official dogma .
The official dogma 's what ?
The official dogma official dogma , the Western official dogma , " If you want to massive the well-being of our citizens . "
The reason is , from a side , in fact that freedom is in itself a value , is pretious , is useful , essential for human beings .
On the other one of us can act for all of us can act for all of us can act for all of us to do that , our well-being , without no one that decide .
The way to massive the freedom is massive to be the choice .
The most choices are , the more they 're free , and the more and the most of the freedom , the most of them is their benefits .
This , I think , it 's so deeply roaded in the society that nobody would dream that nobody would dream it .
And it 's also deeply roadadicated in our lives .
I 'm going to show you some examples of what progress has made possible .
This is my supermarket . It 's not particularly great .
I lose a simple note on the winditous .
In my supermarket , there are 175 , no matter , not contact the 10 variety of the extract of the olive oil and the whsamic aceters that you can buy a number of conditions in the inct circumstance that nobody of the 175 already ready is a big circumstance of your degrees .
Here 's how the supermarket .
And then you go to the wrote of electronic stereo : casse , the CD lettore , radio , radio , piaright , the race .
And in this single store of electronics , there 's a great number of components .
We can do six million different and a half million different combinations using the components that there are in a nearly store .
You have to admit that there 's a lot of choice .
Again : The world of communications .
Once , when I was a child , they could get all the services , and they had a wild , and they were fornites from Mom Bell .
It was a hone-honephone , not buy it .
A consequence of that , the other was that the phone , the phone would never break .
These days are gone .
We have a nearly illimited variety of telephones , especially between the cellular cell .
Here 's the cell phones of the future .
My favorite is the in the middle , MP3 , tapeli , and force for the bird , and force for the cool , and the force for the cool ,
If you don 't have seen the store in the house , you 're just just like , you know , you 're going to get .
And what 's the end is that people enters in the wirts and make this question . And you know , what 's the answer is , " No . "
It 's not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn 't do too much .
So , in other life , which are much more important than the acquirts of the acquirts of choices .
Axistence : no longer in the United States that you go from the doctor and the doctor you have to do .
Instead , you go from the doctor , and the doctor says , " OK , we could do A B , or B , " AAAha these wwells " Be has these wells and risks . What do you want to do ? "
You say , " Do you say , what should I do ? "
And the doctor says , " AAt this wood and these risks , B has these benefits and you have these benefits . "
" What do you want to do ? "
And you 're rebats , " Do you , what would you do ? "
And the doctor : " But I 'm not . "
The result of the result of the " authonomy of the " dress it to look like a beautiful thing .
But it 's actually not that one to move the weight and responsibility to take decisions from somebody who knows something , is the doctor , to somebody else knows , and nearly cerly , and then not in the ideal condition to make a patient decisions that patient .
There 's a huge marketing of drug products , directly to people like me and you , that if you think you don 't have any sense , because if you think you can 't buy them .
But if we can 't buy them , why do they public icize ?
The answer is that they want to domorning , we call the doctor to ask them to change the ret .
So , that 's a fundamental identity is our identity . And as you see in this vignel , " We don 't want to force the children . "
And we can reinvented how many times we aggrade .
That means that every morning , you have to decide that kind of person .
It was a family to the wild , a time the common , and it was almost for anybody , it was that there was a longer , and it was that it was that there was the most soon as possible .
The only real choice was with who , not when , and even even what do after .
Ose the day , it 's really to play .
I teach students very smart students , and I do 20 percent of the work of time .
And it 's not because they 're not very brilliant , not because they 're less diligent .
but why are I impensieres , intent to ask , " Would I married to get to ? "
" Would I married to get to me to think before , or I got to think before , or the career ? "
I 'm interrogatives logiving orants .
And they try to answer these questions , even though this implective , even though this is not a bel of the companies that I 'm not going to get a beautiful vote to my exame .
And they have to do this . I 'm important questions .
Now , the work : we 're lucky , as a Carl , because the technology allows us to work every minute , every day , every angle of the planet , transformer from Hotel Randolph .
I 'm talking about , there 's a angle , and I don 't tell anyone , where the WiFi works .
I don 't say , because I want to use it .
What does this mean , this amazing freedom of choice that we have about work ? It 's not going to be , continuously , if we have to work or not .
We can go to see our son player to play hot , with the cell phone , the Blackberry in the other , and the notebook , therefore , the notebook , thinds .
And even though they 're all spent , every minute that we see our son , we 're asking the party , we 're asking , " Do you have to answer this call ? "
" I have to answer this email ? I have to habababbozzing this letter ? "
And even when the answer is " no , " all this makes the experience of your son , very funny , you know , you know ,
So , from any part of the look , little things and great , materials and life , and life is a question of choice .
Once the world was this : Of , there were some possibility , but it was not a question of choice .
The world of today looks like this : The dilemma is , " Is it a positive thing , or negative ? "
The answer is Same :
The positive laten lats .
All this choice compories two effects of people .
The first , paradoxally , it 's that it produced paralysis that it 's a paralysis ,
With many many options between the things that choice , it 's very difficult to do it .
I give you an example of a meaningful example : a conduct on the volunteer pining .
A connects of a plug in the data of Vange , the gigantic society of pouring , with about a million clients in 2,000 companies .
What she found is that for every 10 solutions that are offered in more , the percentage of two percent .
With 50 source source source , 10 percent of adhhesions than five . Why ?
Because with 50 sources between the wild , which is a hardly difficult decide , and choice is remadied to the intomorrow .
And I love tomorrow , and again , tomorrow , tomorrow , and of course , I never get .
You don 't mean just mean that these work from old old work from the old , because they don 't have enough money , because they don 't have enough money , it 's so hostics that allows the fundamental sources of work .
I don 't participating , they 're losing until five to the work , that would be a worth job , that would be a real real disposed to be true .
So the paralalist is a consequence of having too many choices .
And I think it makes the world .
" And finally , for ethchup , " hamaionese ? "
You would take the right decision , if it 's for the right ethernity , right ?
You don 't want to choose the wrong wrong , and you don 't want to choose the wrong condition .
So this is the first effect . The second is that we can avoid paralalist the paralysis and doing a choice , at the end , we 're less options of how we would have been with less options .
And this for different reasons .
One of these is that with many conditions from the tiny , if you buy one , and it 's not perfect , it 's easy imagination that you could have been better . And that 's that the alternative imagined that you might have been better . And that 's that the alternative imagination of choice , and the replaced the soddisfing the soddisfation that you could have a decision by decision ,
And when it was a great decision .
The more choices there are , the more easier than any detail that 's insophister than the detail .
And also , there 's what economists call expensive opportunity .
Dan Gilbert has closely very well stamattine as the value that we have to things with the confront .
And the rest , when there are so many options , it 's easy to represent the characternative alternative of the alternative alternative art-up , and being less you have been made .
Here 's an example . I 've been schooling with all the ones that are not New York .
But that 's what you would probably think .
There 's this copy in Hamptons .
A lussian place .
Spiach splendida . Ot-day . It 's all about it .
Not nothing . But what he thinks is , " Well , sick , the other thing , it 's Agonow . "
" All my neighbors in Manhattan is on . "
" I could talk about it right in front of the house . "
And two weeks of the idea that 's losing -- every day -- every day -- the possibility of parking .
The expensive opportunity deminual with what we have , as a cell of that we have , as a cell .
And the most are the options that we have to be , the more the accounteristics will come to the expensive as the expensive .
Here 's another example .
This is a lot of things .
It 's about living at the time , and maybe a living slowly .
But the most important point is that anything you choice , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know ,
The things that we don 't choose to be active active , that can make less attractive less what we do .
Third point : spiral growing of expectations .
I tried it on my skin buying a new couple of jeans .
I 'm almost always jeans .
On the jeans were just like , buy them and besid besty , they were unabled , just after you had a life and work with a lot of times , began to go well .
So , I went to buy a couple of a couple of time when the old who were gone , and I said , " I need a couple of jeans , this is my cut . "
The committed me said , " Look , a little fit , a relationship axed ? "
Do you want to do the cernier or the bottons ? " Stonehed , " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " Hejuhed "
" Look , you know , " Look ? "
" Do you want to get them to the bla bla bla bla -- " Continured to elenjoy .
I was sbalord , and after a little bit , I could say , " I want the guy , " I want to say , " Don 't , " I want to all the jeans , and then I had a little bright from the wirst , and then I got out of the jeans that I ever had .
It was the massive . With all that choice had the best .
But I feel worse .
Why ? I wrote a whole book for understood it .
The reason I was worse worse is that with all that choice , my expectations were very much , the jeans had to be perfect .
I was expectations . I didn 't expect anything excited about exceptional , when there was one guy , but when it was 100 different , accidents , at least a kind of had to be perfect .
What I had been buying was good , but not perfect .
After I had to have paragoned that I was sationally in confronted to expectations .
The added options in life of people don 't do that increasing the expectations that these are respective than the excellence of options .
And this will properly defation , even when the results are good .
Nobody in the world of marketing , you know ,
Because if they knew , you wouldn 't know what I 'm talking about .
The truth looks more more than this .
" It was better when he was worse , " The reason he was better when he was worse was worse when he was worse was even possible to meet of surprised .
Ose the world we live in the world we live -- opulents , industrialized citizens with expectancy expectancy -- the massive that we can hope is that things are at the expectations .
You never have surprised as much as your expectations , my expectations , my expectations , you 're ingantic .
The secret of happiness -- what you 're here -- " Brone expectations . "
I mean , small , whographic moment -- that are really married and my wife is really amazing .
I couldn 't do that much , I couldn 't do , I don 't have to do .
But it 's not always a bad thing is not always a good thing .
Finally , a consequence of buy jeans , when there 's just that jeans is that when you 're not suddisfacts , and you ask , " Why ? "
" Who is responsible ? "
The world is responsible . What can I do you ?
When there are hundreds of kinds of jeans , and buy a insophister , and you ask you who are responsible , it 's the clear , it 's the clear , you .
You could do better .
With hundreds of variety of variety and unable , there are no use for insuccess .
So when people take decisions , even though the result is the result , they feel insoddisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdis
In the last years , the depression is explose in the world .
I think a meaning factor -- not the only one , but important -- of this depression of depression is that people have experiences , because the standards are too high .
And when they have to explain this situation , they think that the colame is .
So the final result is that we 're in general , objectively , we feel worse .
Let me remember you .
This is the official dogma , what we all take for good and it 's completely flead . It 's not true .
There 's no doubt that a little bit of choice is better than not have to have any facts , but this doesn 't take a little choice is better than a little bit .
There 's a critical value , magic . I don 't know what it 's .
But I 'm sure we 've overcome from a piece of the things that we were better .
Now , from the political point of view -- I almost finished -- from the political point of view , the nocction is the follow .
What it allows this all this choice in industrial society is the material richness .
There are many places in the world , and you know , where the problem is not that they have any choice .
The problem is that they have too few .
So the thing I 'm talking about is a malbeing extra exclusive , re-lived , the Western society .
And what it does deprimal and angry is this : Steve Levitt talked about yesterday as the expensive and discoveries of the bomb are inuseful .
I mean that these choices , complicated and available , it 's not that they 're inuseful .
I 'm very willing .
They 're worse to them worse .
If you a little bit of what our society in our society allows , and it 's been reversed in those where people have too few possibility , it 's not just their life to improve , but our life .
This is what economists call a paretian improving improving .
A redistribution re-distribution re-distribution re-distribution , not just to the poor -- because of this choice in exception .
So , you can get this , you can become all that you want to be what you want to do . "
You , people are , you think , you think , " But what does that fish ? "
" It 's obvious that you can 't do anything in a glass box . "
" A imagination , a limited view of the world --
and I have interpreted this so , at the beginning .
But then , I think , instead , I realized that that that 's the long knows the long knows .
Because the reality of the facts is that if you 're manda in frantums , so that " everything is possible , " You can 't get the freedom .
If you break the box in a way that all deminured , you know , you can deminate the soddisfation .
You can get the paralysis , and you reduced the well-being .
Everybody needs a sphere .
This is almost certainly too quickly , maybe even for the fish , and certainly for us .
But the above of some symbolic symbolic sphere is a recipe for infelity and , for the ruins .
Thank you very heart .
