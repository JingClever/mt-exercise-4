I showed these slides to demonstrate that the hot hoottical ice , which for almost three million years had the size of the 48 million years had the size of 48 million years had the size of 48 percent .
But this subvalue of the problem because it doesn 't show the gravity of the problem because it doesn 't show the spessor of the ice .
The arctic glacial calots is , in a certain sense , the clean , the puls-up of global climate system .
You 're expanded to the winds and you get summer .
The next slide is going to be a quick carreled to the last 25 years .
The ice perades are signed in red .
You can see , they 're expanded to the blue .
That 's the ice in the winter , which is ritira rhydroom .
You can see that cosidn ice , in five years or more , is like blood , which here is like blood , which here was like blood .
In 25 years , it 's been so , in 25 years , so .
This is a problem because the heavy scale of the ice ice ice ice ice around the ocean where there are enormous amounts of carbon congelated that , and the meled , and you get into the microbes .
I 'm going to get to the totality of the inner atmospheric reming , that amount could double , super--scale point , overoverovercome this point of not remotion .
In some little deep profound lagey , Alaska is already rebolling from water .
The professor Katey Walter of the University of Alaska , a team in a team of a blow last hinvers .
Video : Wow ! Al Gore : Wow ! Al Gore : if we 're also going to be .
And a reason that is that the termal surroenland surroenland from the northern North .
This is a glacial regime .
The brought never reached livels .
This is the Kangerlussuaq , in the west of Groenland .
If you want to know how the sea level for the shelter of the ice of the ice level of the ice , here is where you get to the sea .
These are running fast .
The other side of the planet : Antarctica , the biggest block of the planet .
The month of the scientists have dichieve that the painting of the ice is in negative , and that the Western Antarctica , which pogy on some islands , is particularly quickly in the month .
Equival to six feet feet of the activity , like Groenland .
The Himalaya , the third third of ice , you see new lagey , which a few years ago , a few years ago .
The 40 percent of the world population is half of the water that is going to be able to be able to .
Sulle Ande : this glacier is the source of water .
The brought is increased .
But when it 's going to be a potail water .
In California , the Sierra Nevada is diminued by 40 percent .
The idrices are in crisis .
The predictions , as you read , they 're good .
The growth of security in a remarkable of inceness .
The environmental disaster is increasing a ritain out of the normal and without precedented .
Four times more numheroes in the last 30 years , I respect to 75 .
This is a whole insustainable .
If you look at the historical context if you can see the consequences .
We 've added 70 million tons of CO2 every 24 hours -- 25 million tons of the ocean every day .
Look at attly the area of the oriental Pacific , the Americas , to the west , and in both of the Indian of the subcontinent , where there 's a radical impoverty .
The major cause of global warming , and the deforestation , which is the 20 percent , is the use of fossil fuel .
Or is a problem , and the carbon is even worse .
The United States is one of the two countries with more emissions , and China .
And you 'd proposing to build a lot of other central cents .
But we 're seeing a direction changing .
These are the anullated designs in the last few years and some green proposes of green alternative alternative .
Everyway , there 's a political load in our country .
The carbon industry and oil is spent 250 million dollars in the last year to promote carbon , which is a bunch .
And that image me to something --
Spet Natal , Tennessee , where I live , there was a 3.8 billion lights of carbon .
You may have seen it on the news .
This is the second biggest flow of the last flow in America .
It 's happened around Natal .
The publicity of one of the carbon industry was this .
Video : : It 's the tails , it 's a kind of allegro and happy .
It 's abundant here in America , and it 's growing our economy .
From carbon costy is more and more clean .
It 's good price , adorable and the work , they keep it .
Al Gore : Froginia is a lot of of West Virginia .
The biggest mineral society on the mountains is Massey Coal . This is his administrator .
Video : With Blankenship : I 'm going to be clear -- Al Gore , Nancy Pelosy Peloses -- they don 't know what they 're talking about .
Al Gore : So the Alleance for Protextion of Clima has launched two campaign .
This is a one of them , a part .
Video : Actor : Acy COALergy , we see climate change change climate change in our business .
So our priority is to investing a big amount of money in a effort to make public and make it a lot of money to make public and confused the truth .
In fact , coal is not sporite .
We think it 's clean -- it 's also a good profum .
So you don 't predict about climate change .
Let me do it .
Video : Carbone pulit -- you 've heard a lot of speak .
So we 're going to make a structure to the avaning structure to the avaning of coal .
Straordinary ! The machines are a little rumorous , but this is the sound of coal technology .
The carbon consumption is between the main cause of global warming , but the remarkable technology of coal , but the remarkable technology that you see changes everything .
You look at a look : this is the hodit technology .
Al Gore : Inally , the alternative alternative issue and the security of the national security .
Video : Comment : The economy , the national economy , the national security ,
The thing that connects all : our dependence from the combustible combuyable combustile , like carbon oil and oil imported .
Now , there 's a new , audace , audace solution to use .
Repower : 100 percent of clean energy , in 10 years .
A to remit to the work , make sure , and make sure us sure , and help us stop the global warming .
Finally , a solution that bastes to solve our problems .
Repower . You 're going to be more .
Al Gore : This is the last .
Video : Comment : It 's about requires to America .
One of the fastest ways to bring the dependence from combuyable combuyable , we 'll kill our planet .
Compars : The future is here . Vent , a new energy network .
Compars two : Neggs for ben retribute jobs .
Comment : Repower America . It 's time to be realists .
Al Gore : A old proverbio African says , " If you want to go fast , you go to fast .
If you want to go away , you go to . "
We have to go away , fast .
Thank you very much .
LHC .
And you try to go back to how to get update about how the machine works .
So , there was a lot . And for the one that time , there were no , the LHC is the biggest scientific experiment ever trying to -- 27 kilometers of circles .
Her complaw is to rereconstructions that were present less than a billion in the universe -- to 600 million times a second .
And it 's just environment .
This is the Great machine .
We package these mini-Big Bang inside the remarkers .
This is what I work . It 's called ATLALAS -- is large-foot 2222222,000 feet .
This is a spectacular picture of ATLALATLALAS , building the proportions .
TTTsettember , we acceso the machine for the first time .
And this picture was taken by ATLAS .
It was because of immense festeggases in control .
It 's an image of the first fascies that had done all the around the LHC , enting in collision , by a part of the LHC , and spread particles inside the reevil .
In other words , when we see that picture the 10 walls , we realize that the machine worked , the machine that is a great vittory .
I don 't know if it was this to do us more or this , when someone went on on Google and saw that the page is that .
That means we had a cultural impact beyond .
About a week later , there was a problem with the machine , and it was just to these files here -- these fixed .
These files 13,000 printed , when the machine works at the massive of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power works .
Now , technical technical between you , and they 'll tell , " It 's not true . I 'm fixed too much . "
And they can do it because when they 're very cosidded by the superconductors .
So , at least 271 degrees , at a temperature in the space between stars , these files can bring that run .
In one of the giuntures between the most novemile in the LHC , there was a fect fabrication .
So the files are going to get a slightly , and the 13,000 practices .
This was the result .
Now , this is still more impressive if you think that these magneti fish more than 20 tons , and that you 've been moved about 30 centimeters .
They 're damage about 50 magneti magneti .
We had to take them , what we did .
We 've been repressed and traveled .
They 're now coming back all the place to their place place .
By the end of the mark the LHC will be again .
We 're going to access it , and we expect data to do the right or the bundance or the launch of the way to find what are the morons that are the morons that are the universe .
Now , of course , in a certain way , these accidents reaccended the debate on the value of science and engineering in front of science and engineering in front .
I think the fact that the fact that hard is , the fact that I think that 's the value of things like LHC .
I want to end with the words of a English scientist scientist , Humphrey , which , in difense of inutisearch experiments of his pupille , his pupille was Michael Faraday , he said , " Nist 's a very dangerous to the progress of human mind how to think that the requires of science is defined , that our trionfed to human human mind , and that we don 't have to be able to be able to be there , and that not conququote that there are not a conquake us in nature . "
Thank you .
I want to start asking you about a time when , kids , you play cow up on the morning .
As you can understand how to reach them and deal them , and you know , you know , you actually think and solve problems to think and solve problems and manipulating relationship .
The space reasoning is deeply connected to the way we understand a lot of part of the world around us .
So , from the inspired use of the use of the physical objects , and with my physical objects , and my Pats , and my collaborator Jeevan Kalanithi , I started to ask ourselves , " And if , when we use a computer , instead of having the mouse as a pollar pastract on a desktop of the mouse , we could trust sustake in a desktop of both hands ,
and sistly it to our please ?
The question was so interesting that we decided to explore the answer , building Siftable .
In a few words , a Siftable computer is a great interactive .
In a few words , a Siftable computer is a great interactive .
You can move with their hand , they can see their hand , you know , you feel the way and they have a screen and a screen and a radio wireless .
But most of them , are physical objects , like the mors , you can move to simply affiry .
Siftable is the example of a new ecosystem to manipulate digital information .
And as they become more physical , consciousness of the other movement , and as they become more physical , consciousness of the movement , of the other people , how we can explore new and different styles of interaction .
I 'm going to start with some simple example .
This Siftable is configured to show video : if you 're going to cross-up video . And video is going to be like this , if you 're going to cross-up video .
These interactive rits are conscious about other .
If you deal them , they 're interested in what they 're around .
If they 're surrounded , and they can do it a little bit .
If they 're surrounded , and they can do it a little bit .
They also have their clination and inclination .
We then realized that one of the interests in the interaction was to be able to use managed to data , for example , " a color like , " a color like a liquid .
In this case , we have three Siftable configured as a ble-baby , and I can use them to the color in the central , where you mix .
and I can use them to the color in the central , where you mix .
We 're too too much , we can put a little place .
I 'm also beautiful possibility of learning , like language , and the mathematics and logic games where people can try things fast , and you see the results of the immediately .
Now , I 'm --
This is a Fibonacks that I do with a program of equations .
We have a words that 's a game of words that 's half in Scarabeo and Boble .
Pratically , at every turn-re-case on every Siftable , Pratically , every Siftable , Pratically , every Sifable , and as you know , and as you know , and as you know , in the Sifable ,
Then , about 30 seconds you get mix , and you have a new leck set and new possibility to try .
Thank you .
So here 's the kids came to the Media Lab , I did a way that tried them and I tried a video .
They 're very liked .
And one of the interesting things like this kind of application is that you don 't have to give people a lot of education .
You 've got to say , " Compons of words , and they know exactly what do .
Here , other people who try it .
This is our young heads , there on the right .
It actually wanted to just impilling them .
They 're only morning in the morning ,
Now , this is a application of a interactive carton .
We wanted to build a tool for the apprentice of language and Lui is Felix .
It can insert new characters in the scene , and you know , and you know , and you can get the Siftable .
It can insert new characters in the scene , and you know , and you know , and you can get the Siftable .
So , here 's doing the sun .
Video : The sun is smile .
David Merrill : Now she brought a treat in the scene .
Video : The arange hate .
Bel work ! Yeah .
So , the Siftable and you can make the neighbor can interact the characters --
Video : Bau !
-- by inventing your story .
Video : Hey .
DM : It 's a story with the open , and it can decide how you get him .
DM : It 's a story with the open , and it can decide how you get him .
Video : From , y-cat .
DM : The last example I have time to show you is a tool , to campaign and exececececection , to truck and exececececececutiary music .
It 's a tool , which is a recently , to tramples and execececececutionary music .
The Siftable here , the Siftable , like the bass , and the bacteria .
Each one of these has four different variations , and you can choose that use .
You can also insert these sounds in a sequence to compories .
And you 're going to move it by by making a sound and a sequence . "
These are actually actually able effective and the filter .
The attacks to a particular particular sound and then inclens to travel it .
And then there are general effective , as long and fly , that you 're going to be able to the interal sequence .
Let 's look like it works .
Video : We 're going to try and a basic base in two Siftable sequence , we put it in a series , we add on the other base .
Now I put a ball line .
Video : Now , I add percussions --
Video : And I 'm going to put the phild to battery , so I can control the effect from the vial .
Video : I can see the internal inter-sequence inters by the way , or on the other .
Video : And now I 'm going to add the bottom to give a more expression .
Video : I can recombine the sequence of the flight .
So I don 't have to plan it before , but I can improvised , and rerecognize , and the longer or the cord .
And now , finally , I can spend the inters on the left Siftable to the Bride .
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is building new interfaces more and more sounds like our brain and the body work and the body .
And today , I had time to show you one of the result of this , and also some possibility we try to bring out of the lab .
The concept I want to transmit is that it 's coming to this new generation of designed to interact with digital media , that will bring information in our world .
Thank you very much .
I don 't see the now to talk to all of you .
I 'm a writer .
I 'm going to be books is my profession , but it 's more than this , of course .
It 's also love and the fashion and the cine of my life .
And I don 't expect that it can change .
But , this particular thing about this particular is something that was recently in my life and my career , which brought me to report the interior report with this work .
The particular thing is that I recently written this book , this biography called " Mangia , Prega , " which , diversally from my books , and so so much from my books , and it became a great , bestseller , the international feeling .
And the result is that everywhere , people treat me as if I was convicted .
It 's true -- convicvictims .
They 're going to be all worried and they say , " Don 't you feel that much more ?
You don 't care about the whole life without being able to write the whole life without being able to create a book that can be able to create a book that can be able to be somebody ? "
that can be important to somebody ? "
It 's certainly sure , you know .
But I 'm worse , in the one I remember that more than 20 years ago , when I started to say , the people -- I was a writing -- I wanted to be a write .
I would go to the same reaction , the same reaction .
And people said , " Don 't you cause I couldn 't have success ?
Do you don 't care that the umillion people 's refired ?
Do you don 't care about the whole whole life without nothing about it to be there and death and death on a cumulation of dreams with the mouth of the bits of the bunch of advance . "
So , you know .
The answer to all of these questions is , " Yes . "
Yes , I 'm fear to all of those things .
I always had fear .
And I also fear with many other things that people can 't income .
As the algae and other things spent .
But , as as as I was write what I thought and I would ask me the last multimate is why ?
Is it rational ?
It 's logical that anybody have to expect be spent by a work that you 've been born to do .
But what 's so particular in the impress , creative impress us about the mental health care of the other carrier , in a way that other carry don 't do ?
How my father , for example , he was a chemist engineer and I don 't remember one time in his 40 years of activity , where he was asked if he was a engineer ?
There was never -- that block of engineer John , how does it go ?
Don 't it work so , you know ?
Onestly , chemical engineers like group have not certainly , in the centuries , guadagned the reputation of being alcolized maniaces .
We 've been writers , we have enough this reputation , and not just writers , but creativity of every kind , we have this reputation of being enormous .
And it 's not the other that you look at the sad of the magnificments of the magnificments of the magnifeth century , they died young people and often died young people and often .
And the ones that don 't seem to be really disfaced by their dunes .
Nortman Mailer , before I was going to die , in the last interview said , " Every my book killed me a little more than an extraordinary affermonation about work .
But we don 't really get it when we feel that because we 've heard these things so long that in some way , we 've completely interiorized and accepted the notion that creativity and suffering are in some way , and that art , at the end , at the end , it will always conduduce .
And the question I want to take all of today is , you know with this idea ?
You know this thing -- because it 's also about a centimeter of distance to me not good for this supposition .
I think it 's households .
And I think it 's also dangerous and I don 't want to see the perpetuated in the next century .
I think it 's better encourage our big creative minds .
And I know that , in my case -- in my case -- in the situation -- it would be very dangerous to start to fight that feeding , especially , you know , in my career .
That 's really -- you look at , they 're pretty young , I have about 40 years .
I still have about four decades of work in me .
And it 's very likely that everything I 'm going to be judged by the world as the work that came out after the world , as the work that was going to be judged in my book .
I 'm going to be slavt , because we 're all more or less friends here -- it 's likely that my big success is to my big success is to my shoulder .
Oh , Gesus , who thought !
You know this is the kind of thinking that leads a person to start to bing a nine in the morning and I don 't want to do it .
I would keep going to continue this work that we do .
So , the question is , how ?
And so I think , after many reflective , which the way to work to keep write is to create a psychological construction , OK ?
I have to find a safety of security between me , and I 'm wrinking , and my natural anxial that written can get to be able to do it , and as I was trying to find other society to find other society to find other society to find other society to find other society to find other society to be better and more and sane and more and sane and more and sane more and sane .
as to help people creative to manage the inerent people who are motional response to creativity .
And that research has led me to the ancient Great and ancient .
Seguitees because it gira in circle and then go back .
In the ancient Grek and ancient people don 't seem to believe that creativity came from men , OK ?
And it was thinking that creativity was this spirit , and that came to men from a few distant smies and known , for distant reasons and known , for distant reasons and known .
The Great the Greeen divins of creativity ,
Socrate , wonderful , it believed to have a bunch that elargives you a wisdom that you can go away .
The Rohands were the same idea , but called the the kind of spirit .
The Rohands didn 't really think that a genius was a very clear .
They think that a genius was this kind of divine entity , which was actually in the muri of an artist study , a little like the elpho Dobby , and that came out of hiding the work of the article work of artist and models the result of the artist and models the result of that work .
Extional -- here is the distance of which I talk about -- that psychological construction that protects from your work .
And everybody knew that was so that it worked , right ?
So , the anti-artists were protected by certain things , like , for example , you know , you know , no ?
If your work was exceptional , you couldn 't take it all the desert , everybody knew that the time , everybody knew that the time .
If your failure , it wasn 't your whole , you know , it was not your own , right ?
Everybody knew that it was your genius to be a inable .
And so people han conceived people creativity in Occcccient for a long time .
Then the Renenciement came and everything changed , and it 's going to change the center of the universe on the center of the universe on the center of the universe and the mysteries and without any space and the mysteries and writing writing .
This was the principle of the rational humans and people started thinking that creativity came from the ilililighting .
And the first time in history , you start to referred to this or artist , like a rather than a genius than a person with genius .
And I have to tell you , I think that was a big mistake .
I think that allow somebody , a simple person to believe that that we 're like a recipient like a recipient , the essence and the surprising , creativity , creativity , and creativity , and inknowledge , and you know , and the human beings .
It 's like to ask someone to ingoiate the sun .
Deform and destores completely the ego and creates all these ingestifty expectations on performance .
And I think it was this pressure to having artists in the passed 500 years .
And if that 's true , and I think that is , the question becomes , and now ?
Can we do that diversity ?
Maybe I 'm going to go back to a more ancient understanding of human relationship and mystery creative .
Or maybe not .
Maybe we can 't docell 500 years of rational thinking in a de-18 minutes .
And there 's probably people in the audience that would be reading the scientific sospects on the notion of , you know , you know , they follow the next people spacing people ,
I 'm going to tell you all about this thing .
But the question I 'd like to ask is , why isn 't it ?
Why would you not think that in this way ?
Because it 's more sense of everything that I 've ever heard to explain the exasperts of the creative process .
One process that , as anybody who ever attempt to do something -- so , basically , all here -- you don 't comprehensive .
And in fact , in fact , it can sometimes be completely paranormal .
I did this meet in recently in the Ruth Stone , who has now 90 years , but that was a poeter for all of life and said that during her childhood in the rural Virginia , working out in the rural Virginia , and feel it , in if a pox came from the landscape .
He said that it was like a fragriculum of air .
And that was rotoling to her from the landscape .
He was to feel that , because he was trying to get the land under his feet .
He knew I had one thing to do at that point and was of , and she was , and she would say , " run a matta . "
And so he wouldn 't have to get home and she was going to be able to take a piece of paper and a little bit enough and a matite enough , and a matit 's fast enough , and it would collect it and focus on the page .
And sometimes you couldn 't be fast enough , so it 's going and correcreceived and the rotolar without getting home and the poetry and the poetry and the poetry , and she would continue to rotolar through the landscape , and you know , as a poet . "
Then there were those times -- this piece of the time -- this piece never dementize -- there were almost losing , right ?
So , he was running home and she was trying to try and the poem was going through , and he was going through , and then he was like , and then he was like , and then he was like , and then he was like if you get away and the steffer .
He had the poem from the coda and remained it in his body and transced it on the page .
And in these cases , the poem is a perfect and intact , but the contrary of the last word .
So when I heard it -- it 's crazy , it 's exactly the same same thing .
Not all my creative process -- they 're not a concerned .
I 'm a mule , and my way to work is ; you know , you know , you get up in the horary every day and play and I 'll go on and work and go on and go on and go on the goffly .
But even I was in my headlining heads , I 've been brought that thing , sometimes .
And I guess that many of you the han .
You know , even if the work and ideas came up with a certain source , you can 't honestly know .
And what is this thing ?
And how can we relate it to it in a way that you don 't lose your head , but rather , rather , what do we do you get skid ?
And as I 'm about , the best contemporary example I have is the musician , I 've been the Waits , which I interviewed different years ago for a day .
We were talking about this , and you know , Tom , for the majority of life was the incarnation of the inartist tomented in contemporary , trying to control , domining these species of impulses .
But then I 'm going to invecent , and one day , and one day , and he was driving on a road in L.A. , changed everything for him .
He was going to be fast and everything with this little framment of melodia , which is in his head as the inspiration , and it 's going to , elusial and the wallpoints , and the desider , but it doesn 't know how to take it .
He doesn 't have a piece of paper , it doesn 't have a matt .
So I was going to feel this kind of old old species , and he said , " I 'm going to lose , and I 'm going to be able to lose , and I 'm going to be able to lose .
I 'm not good enough and I can 't do it . "
And instead of going to go to the panic , and I 'll stop .
I 'm going to do the whole mental process process and made something completely new .
And I 'm going to look at the sky and said , " Scell , you know , I 'm driving ? "
" Who seems to write a song hour ?
If you really want to exists , you get a more opporter , when I can take care of you .
Or , you go to importantly qualcause somebody else today .
I went to disturbing Leonard Cohen . "
And his process changed after this .
Not work , the work , it was still dark , as a always .
But the process , and the fish that was that attended to be reduced when the genius , the genius that outside him , the genius that outside of him , and the genius that was going to go from where , and he was making it not to be a interior thing .
but you get this peculiar , wonderful bizarre collaboration between Tom and this strange thing that was not Tom .
So , as the felt that story started to change a little bit also the way I was working and I was already saved .
This idea , I was written by written , Prega , Ama , " and fall in one of those cave of the disperation where we 're all working on something and we can 't start thinking about something and we can 't start thinking that it will be a disaster , which is going to be the worst book .
Not just bad , right , right the worst book written .
And I started thinking about this project .
But then I remind you about Tom , and I tried to go .
So I went to my face on the walls and deressed my face to a vacuum of the room .
And I said , " Sents , what , you 're going to go , and you know that if this book doesn 't be brilliant not to be a brilliant , no ?
Because as I 'm putting everything I 'm going to , I don 't have this .
So if you want to be better , you have to presented you and do your side .
OK . But if you don 't do it , you know what , I don 't do anything .
I 'm going to write the same because it 's my work .
And I 'd like to do for me that it was recorded that I 'm presented to do my part , " because -- finally , then , OK --
And they were always magnifes , because the ballerins were professionals and they were great .
But every long , rarely , something happened , and one of these artists became actually transcendent .
And I know what you know about what you 're all seen , because I know you all saw , a performance .
It was like the time , and the baller-walk through a kind of land-up , and it was not doing anything different from the soldier , like 1,000 , but everything was all of them .
And suddenly not appearance as a human .
But it 's accentioned from the divinity of divinity .
And when this next , the temples , people knew what was , they called him .
They were their hands and began to dotar , " Allah , Allah , God , God , God , " God , God , " God , " God , "
That 's God , you know .
With the Morrian invaded -- when the Mororries the Spain , preser this habits , and the pronoundly changed in the center of the " Allah , Allah , " in the " Alah , " which you can still hear in the corries or in the flamp .
In Spain , when a artist did something impossible and magic , " Allah , the , the , Allah , the magnific , I was good , " incomprehensible , I mean , I was a last thing .
And it 's great because we need .
But , the problem comes the day , the ballerine , and the ballerine , when you go up and discover that are 11 in the morning of Martedday and the last 11 of God and the last one .
It 's just a mortal with gran bad bad ginock , and maybe it 's not going to be able to make that altitude .
And maybe nobody 's going to have the name of God , and what does it have to do with the rest of his life ?
It 's hard .
This is one of the most painful recognized paints to a creative life .
But maybe it doesn 't have to be so angoal if you can 't believe , and you know , and you know , and the most extraordinary aspects of your being come from yourselves .
But you might just say that it 's data in prested by an inimaginable source of this team of life that you have to go to someone else when you end .
And , you know , if we think it 's all changes .
And so I started thinking about it , and it 's certainly as I thought for several months in the book that I 'm going to be on , the dangerous , the dangerous , attesissively , attesissively , attesissively , attesissively .
And what I have to keep me when I feel eleved by this is , it 's not fear .
Not just to go .
You can put your side to presently your side , any can be .
If your work is balling , you ball .
If the divine , I 'm assurd to you , and I just draw a few kind of wonderful , for a moment , for one moment , you know , you know .
You know , you do the same dance .
And it 's " Ole ! " at you .
I think and I think , you should teach it .
" Ole ! " You know , just to have had human love and testing tack-to-up , you 're going to present you continue to make you continue .
Thank you .
Thank you .
June Cohen : Ole !
As you know , I 've talked about some of these designs about what the human genome can mean and discovery of new new set of genes .
We 're starting a new path : we started to digitalize biology and now by that digital code we 're both in a new phase of biology , designing and willing life .
We always tried to ask a big questions .
" What is life ? " That 's something that I think we 've tried to understand vary livels .
We 've tried different approaches , reduced to the minimum .
We 're digitizens from almost 20 years .
When we sequenced the human genome was treated to go from the analome of the digital world .
Now , we ask , we can regenerate life , or create new life from this digital universe ?
This is the map of a small organism , Mycoplasma genitalium , which is the species from the genome that can authorean .
And we tried to reduce the genome to create a little bit more small .
We 're able to eliminate a hundred genes of about about about 500 .
But when we look at his metabolic map , it 's relatively simple respect to our .
I think , this is simple .
But when we look at all the genes that we can eliminate , one at the time , it 's very unlikely that this can bring a living cells .
So we decided that the only way to progret was synthize this chromosoma way that we could actually modify the components to bring some of these fundamental questions .
And so we started the adventure of " Can we can synthize a chromosoma ? "
Can you realize that chemistry is to produce these big molecules that we never had to create before ?
And in case , we can make a cross-up ?
A chromosoma is just a piece of chemical material .
The speed that we 're going to digitalize the life is growing ritain .
Our ability to write the genetic code , instead , procrete rather slowly , but it 's better .
And our most recently results the recently exponential .
We 've been a lot more about 15 years ago .
The process has been required , and we start with a bioetic review before we began the first experiments .
But we found that synthize DNA is very difficult .
There are tens of thousands of cars in the world that make small DNA segments , in the long , of the long age of 30 to 50 lectops and it 's a degenerative process : the most mistakes there .
So we had to develop a new method to assemble these fragments and correct the mistakes .
And this was our first attempt to try and information information from the genome of the X 174 .
It 's a small virus that killed bacteria .
We designed the fragments , effectuated the correction of the mistakes and get a molecule of about 5,000 lectops .
The interesting part is when we took this piece of chemistry inert material , and we put it in the bacteria , bacteria have started reading this genetic code and produring the viral particles .
The viral particles have been reduced by cells , they come back and they destroyed the Ecccles .
I talked about recent with members of oil industry and the oil industry and they 're certainly compressed this model .
They have been flier than you .
We believe that this is a situation where software can really build his same hardware in a biological system .
But we wanted to do things bigger in the big .
We wanted to build the entire chromosoma of bacteria .
They 're more than 580 mile mile letters .
So we thought we built it in the casss of the virus , so we can change the cassets that you can understand what the components of a living cells .
The design is crucial , and if we start with digital information in a computer , these have to be very accurate .
When we sequenced this genome for the first time in 1995 accuratness was a mile for every 10 mile .
We found that , 30 mistake . If we had to use that original sequence , we 'd never been able to work .
One part of the process is designing 50 lecking around the 50 leck-segments with all the other segments of 50 letters to build subunits smaller underneath .
We try to the only element here .
You probably read that we 've been reading that we 're going to be a great .
So , think , we have a genetic code on four letters : An , C , G and TG and .
Three of those letters , codify together about 20 friend , and there 's a specific order to read for every friend .
So we can use the genetic code to write words , frases , thinking .
What we 've done in the beginning was autographed .
Some of them were dollar that wasn 't poem .
We designed these segments to just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just just a little bit to me .
There are me that they repair them and they put them .
And we started assemble with segments , starting with segments from five to seven mile , and then you get to the segments of 24 mile lectural , and uncles up to 72 mile mile .
We 've been a willing these segments in abundance so we 're trying to create a very robusted processing that we 're trying to create a very robustobestoke -- as you 'll see in a minute .
We 're trying to automatize the process .
So , this seems the tabellone of the basket .
When we get these very long , much more than 100 mile , over 100 mile , they don 't grow in the Ecccles .
You get to the modern of the molecular biology of molecular biology .
So we 've been considered other mechanisms .
We knew about another mechanism called recombination , and and in biology , and in biology , and in biology , and then you can go to the DNA segments .
Here 's an example .
This organism , called Deinococcus radiodurs , can absorb three million radiation .
You can see in the soft squarromosome as his chromosome .
In 12 -- 24 hours is reputting exactly like it was before .
There are thousands of organisms that they 're able to do that .
These organisms can sit completely .
They can live under empty .
They 're absolutely sure that life in space , and you know , and you feel to find some rich exchange .
ASA showed that that , NASA showed that this is .
This is a picture of the molecule that we 've built using these processes , just using the lights with design appropriate design , you know ,
The lights them assemble .
This image was not taken with a microscope , but with a microscope .
It 's a very big molecule that we can see it with a light microscope .
These are photo I 'm going to have about six seconds .
This is the publishing that we 've done a little time ago .
They 're over 580,000 letters .
It 's the biggest molecule of a defined structure ever created by man .
It 's a 300 million molecular weight to 300 million .
If you 're going to stage it with a 10 without spaces , you 'd like 142 pages to transcer this .
Now , how do we do it work ?
Of course , a virus is a game from kids .
It 's a little more complicated when you use bacteria .
It 's simpler also when it 's eucariote like our : you can just summer the nucleo and put another , which is basically the process of cloning .
In the bacteria , the chromosoma is is instead of integrated inside the cells , but we 've been able to do a complete trapiler of a cross-chromosoma from one cell , and to activit .
We can clean a cross-cross-up species .
The two are different as men from the topes .
We added some gene more in a way that you can decide what to do for this chromosoma .
The skied and the skied with the enables so to kill all the proteins .
And when we put it in the cells was stupendo-- and you 'll appreciate our sophphphotos -- the new chromosophisticatost -- the new chromosophisticatoes -- and you 'll be in the cells .
And we 're thinking that we couldn 't go beyond , but we tried anymore to spinger us there .
This is one of the major mechanisms of evolution .
We discovered that a lot of species have added a second or a chromosoma somewhere , added in a second thousand new traits to the species .
So , who think about evolution as a only gene , and you know , it didn 't understand much much much of the biology .
They 're going to be called " " " " " " " " " " " It 's going to be a kind of a DNA .
The chromosoma that was in the cells doesn 't have one .
The cell phone chromosoma that we have inserit-down .
You know , it 's expressed , and it recognized the other crumosoma , has masticed , and we 've been found with only the cells and the new chromosoma .
It has become blue because of the genes we 've inserted .
And in a short leverse of time , all the characteristics of a species , you 've been done , and you 've been transformed in a new species , based on the new software that we 've inserted in the cells .
And all the proins have changed , the members have changed , and when we read the equivalent to the genetic code exactly what we 've transported .
Now , this might seem alechectic genetic , but altering the software , we can change things in manipulation .
Now , I 've already explained that there 's not about genesesis -- but to be a departy of three million years and a half million evolution , and I said that maybe we 're going to create a new version of Cambrian explosion of Cambrian explosion of new species on this process .
Why do that ?
I think it 's enough obvious when we think about our needs .
We 're going to move from six billion and a half billion people in the next 40 years .
Just to give an example : I 'm born in 1946 .
There are three people on the planet for each one in 1946 ; there 's been four .
We 're having problems now to find food , fresh water and pull , dy-to-and-a-half billion and a half billion people .
It 's going to be more than to do it for nine billion .
We use more than five billion carbon , 30 billion carbon , more than 30 billion barium .
That means a million barium of the day .
When we try to find biologic processes , or any kind of process to replace , it 's going to be a huge challenge .
We have to keep the whole whole emission of CO2 from these materials that end up in the atmosphere .
And the day , because of the scientific discoveries in the world , we have a database with about 20 million genes , and I like to think that are the design components .
The electronic industry only one dozen of about components , and think about how many different things are coming out .
Our limitations here are principles from the biological reality and our imagination .
We 've now got techniques , because of these rapid methization , in order to create what we call that fight genomics .
We 're able to build a big robot that can produce a million chromosomes a day .
Think of processing these 20 million genes or to try to get to get to produce either or drugs , new vaccines , and we can change , and new vaccines , we can change , thank you , and create more biology .
And it 's just a standard selection .
We can choose to be able to survival , chemical production or carburant , production , chemical vaccines .
This is an instantaneous instantaneous instantaneous software programs we 're working to seats and design species to design a computer .
Well , we don 't need to be .
We know exactly how their genetic code .
We 're now fourth of the fourth generation .
You 've seen that you can extract out of the granol was a bad experiment .
We have carbon on , and third generation that are going to be done by the highest carburant , as the either or or the different kinds of value as the either or different kinds of butanol .
But the only way the biology of the biology can have a big impact without increasing the cost of food and limitary the cost of food and limitary the cost of the first , and we 're working on the bottom , and we think we can have the first carbon , and we think we can think that the first carbon fuel cells in about 18 months .
The solar light solar with CO2 is a metodo-- but in our discoveries , we 've found different metods .
This is a organism that we described in 1996 .
He 's in the ocean , about 2,500 meters of the water temperature of ebullition of water .
They create meter from CO2 using hydrogen molecular hydrogen .
We 're trying to understand if we can incanalate CO2 , which can easily be translated tubi tubes , converting that CO2 in carbons , to drive this process .
So , we think that 's a short thing that we could be able to increase what the basic question is , " What 's the Noi , veramental modth -- we have the modth of replace the interal industry .
Exactly . If you don 't do it from TED , where you can ?
It would be a main energy source .
And we 're also working to use the same metods to to create vaccine instantanane-wish vaccines .
You 've seen this year with influence , we 're always going to go back and a dollar in less when it 's about finding the wine .
I think that what you can change building vaccines in ancient advertising .
So , here 's how the future might be changing , now , the tree of evolution , to the evolution with battery bacteria , and you know , and initially , you know , euck cells .
We 're so much from improving people .
Our discovered is to do it . Thank you very much much long enough to try it . Thank you very much .
First of all , I 'm going to show you , the faster possible , some fundamental work , the new technology that we brought to a quick almost a year ago . This is Seadragon .
It 's a environment that you can interact is at the local level that remote with a huge amount of visual data .
We 're seeing a lot of box , we 're seeing a lot of digital phoom , and I keep on a little bit , and a fast , and a fast , and I have images like we want .
And it doesn 't matter how much much much much much as the amount of information that we see , how big these things are the data or images .
Most of the digital photographs , but this is a scanning scanning from the Biary of Congress , and reenter in the gamples of the Congress , and re-fall in the gampixels .
It doesn 't make any difference because the only thing that you have the prestations of a system like this is the number of pixel on your screen in any time . It 's also a very flexible architecture .
This is a book , an interium , example of data not images .
This is Casa desolated Dickens . Every colonna represents a capitle .
And to show you that it 's just about the text and not images , we can do something like that , to see that it 's a real representation of the text , not a picture .
It could be a little artificial way to read a little electronic book .
Not the advice .
This is a more realistic example . It 's a number of the NGuardian .
Every image is the beginning of a sex-section .
And it gives you really like the please of reading the version of reading version , a magazine , or a quote , which is for a molteplice .
We also did something with the angle of this particular number of the Look in particular particular number of the Woman .
We 've created a high-resolution advertising -- much more higher than what you use in a normal advertising , and we 've put it in the content .
If you want to see the characteristics of this automobile , you can see here .
Or other models , or even the techniques .
And this really really demonstrates some of these ideas to eliminate the screen .
We hope that that that means you can put a few hone-up and other porcheries , you don 't have to be necessary .
Of course , the map is one of the most obvious applications for this kind of technology .
And on this is not lose time , if we don 't say we have contribute to give you in this field .
These are all the streets in the U.S. geospaacecraft , in the U.NASA .
So now we move something else .
This is actually actually the way from the Web ; you can go to see it .
It 's a project called Photosynth , which combine two different technologies .
One is Seadragon and the other is a very interesting visual computer computer that was done by Noah Snavely , a student of Washington , with the aid of the University of the University of the UW Seitz Rick Seitz Rick Seitz . " At collaboration . "
And it 's from the Wb , I managon Seadragon .
You can see it when we do this kind of screen , where we can go from an image to the other picture and have this kind of experience to the last multiple experience .
But the space collocation of the images here has actually actually a meaning .
The algorithms of computers have recorded these images together , so that you know , in the real places that I guess to the repress -- all over the lagons to the Blagnnakes Grasis on the Magne Rockadesious , and these things are screen . And these things are screen .
I don 't know if I have time to show you some other environment .
There are some more spacececraft .
I want to move directly to one of Noah-- and this comes from a precedent prototype of Photosynthrotosynthrotosynthrotosynthy , technology Photosynthroyed . And it 's not necessarily evident about the chiad , technology . Phototosynthroyse . And it 's not necessarily evident that we put in the website .
We had to worry about legal aspects and on the way .
This is a reconstruction of Notre Dame images , and by Flickr . Bao digital , Notre Dame in Flickr and you get pictures of the campus and you can get pictures of these arange cones in the areange of these arange cones an image that has been discovered to this model .
So , they 're all images from Flickr and you 're all connected to the space level in this way .
And it 's possible to navigate this very simple way .
You know , I never thought to end end up to work for Microsoft .
It 's very gratifying to get this kind of acaafe here .
I think you can see that that 's a lot of different types of fotoches : from those of the cell phones to the SLR , a meaning , a meaningful number of meaning , put together in this environment .
And if you can , I try and try and look at the most strange .
Many are blocked by faces , etc .
Somewhere there 's a series of photographs -- ecks .
This is a Nototre Notre Dame recorded .
We can move from the mote physics of this environment .
The essential point is that we can do things with social environment . This is now by taking data from the interal memory of how to the inters to how to be apping the land , from the visual point of view -- and to all those data together .
And all those pictures become connected together , the major of the parts .
You have a model of the earth of the interest that emerging .
Think about this as a prolungment of Stephen Lawler on Earth .
It 's something that grows in complexity as people use it , and the people use it , and the walls for people who use it .
Their pictures are husbed with the fabed meters .
If somebody comes the idea of contrast to each other , and you know , the name of the Notre , my cattedral of Notre Dame improvised , and I can use it as a requires of all those data , and I can use the point of the space , and you can have a photos of anyone , and have a cross-user experience .
Of course , a consequence of all of this is the virtual models , all of the interesting stuff of the earth , collecting not just to see and you 're satellite images and sight and similar images and similar images and similar pictures .
Milles .
CA : I understood what your software is going to get us to do is that , at a certain point , in the next few years , all of the photographs , all of the photographs are going to be practically connected with ?
BAA : Yes . What 's doing is actually ,
He 's creating perlink , if you want , you know , in images .
And it 's doing it in the bottom of images .
And the thing is really interesting if you think about rechef to the reckidney information that many of these images .
As you do a research research on the Web , you digit a phrase and the text on the web page has a lot of information about images .
Now , what if that picture is you connects to all your pictures ?
So the amount of several interconnection and the amount of richness that is really really enormous . It 's a classic effect of the network .
CA : Blaise , it 's really incredible . Compedents .
BAA : I thank you very much .
One of the pleasure pleasure when you go and one of the ethnographics of the ethnographics is the living between who has no antial anti-tradions , between the wind , you have the past in the wind , you stuck on the wind , you get it in the wind and love .
Basti thinking that the scigs Jaguar viach beyond the Via Lattea , or that the Inuit 's still collim of meaning , or that in Himalaya , or that in Himalayas , to remind the respair of the Dharma , but to remind the importance of the central anththropology , and that the idea that the world 's not in which we live in .
the consequence of a particular adaptative choices that our bundry has done , well or bad , many generations ago .
And , of course , we all share the essential traits .
We all procreating .
We 're subjects to start .
We have to deal with the inesorability of deed , so we don 't surprise us if we 're going to focus --
We all have an art .
What it does is the particular ritain of the song , the rhythm of the dance of every culture .
Not care that they 're the Penan Is the Rousor the following Vodoo , or the WWote , or the desert of Kenya , or the desert Kenya , or a Curander , or a cammar in the Sahara .
He was my journey in the desert a month ago , or a a buncer in the desert of Qomolanger , on Everest , the world 's dead .
All of these people teachers us that there are other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking ,
And if you think a moment , you think it 's a concept that you can give you hope .
And we put the myriads of the world creating a ragnote of cultural life and it 's important to the bench and it is important to the bench of the planet and it 's important to the bench of the planet as biosphere .
And you can think about this ragnela cultural ragnating , and you can call the etnosphere , the total sum of all the concepts , dreams , and ideas , inspirations , inspirations , intuitions , intuitions , intuitions ,
The etnosphere is the great patriage of humanity .
It 's the symbol of what we 're and what we can be in how much species .
And because biosphere was gravly consumed as a fer consumed as a success to the etnosphere and undly unly .
Nobody biologist , for example , it would say that 50 percent of all species was or is on the orders of the extinction just because it 's flepocalypocalitted -- in the most apocalyptic diversity -- and you don 't have a little bit more optimistic -- the one of cultural diversity .
The indiculous of that is , of course , the language .
When you were born 6,000 language and on this planet .
And a language is not just composed by a vocabulary or a series of rules .
And a language of the human spirit .
It 's the middle that the animal of every culture comes in the material world .
Every language is a forest , a toilet , a thinking , a spiritual possibly spiritual possibility .
And of those 6,000 language , as we 're sitting in Monterey , at least half the half of the hasn 't sued in the oreck of children .
They don 't get to kids to , the people who want to say , at least that doesn 't trust something , which are already death .
What is the most sad of being flights from the silence , of being the last to talk a language , the way to talk a language , not we transmit the wisdom of the sagdom of the saving of the kids ?
This is a flow is the state of somebody in the world every two weeks : every two weeks , a year , a year , and a smaller and door with the tomb , sillabs a language .
And I know somebody 's going to say , " Don 't it much ?
The world wouldn 't be a better place if we talk about all the same language ? "
Let 's talk about kogs .
You 'll find a tract thing that you can 't talk about your language .
I 'd like to give you a journey through the etnosphere --
a small journey in the etnosphere to give you a killing of what we 're losing .
Many of us forget that when I say , " different ways of exists , " intend , " intend different ways of exists .
We take for example for example , Barasana , Amazonia , Amazonia , the popular anacond , which creates the myth of provent , which creates the myth of saconest in the sandandwest ,
It 's a popular that 's not able to distinguess the blue color from the green green because you were identified in the forest , where you 're depends .
They have a strange language and a matrimonial rule , called an exogamia . "
And all of that has radical the past mystery , sucks , but the particularity is that in these families , and they 're talking about six or seven language , and they have mons , or seven language .
They 're limited to listen and then they start talking .
We take one of the most interesting tribes that I lived , the Waorans of Ecuador nort-nort-the-ununbelieved that he had the first contacts in 1958 .
In 1957 missionary missionary conact a factor .
They 've been to sending the photo , that they were requires , and they would come back that this popular forest , and that this popular forest .
They collected the photo from the earth , they 've been to research a shape or a shape , and not find nothing , they 'd concluded that it was the deavle , and they killed the five missioners .
But Waorans don 't kill the strangers .
They killed between them .
54 percent of the mortality was caused by their same .
We 're going to eight generations and we found two cases of natural death and when we insight , they admit to know , they had an invecent that one of them was invecent , and then they were killed , and then they killed him him him .
The crubbers were able to recognize the 40 steps and recognize the species .
In the early ' 80s , I was assigned a very interesting task when my professor of Harvard , if I wanted to go to Harvard the potence of the potence of the power of the power of the power of Duvalier and Tonton Macodhomet and the Tonton Macodes to do the slubies .
And to give a sense of a miracologist , I 'd have to understand the Vodoo culture , and the Vodoo isn 't magic .
It 's pretty much about a metapphysical vision of the world .
Many interesting .
If you ask me to tell me the big religions of the world , what would you say ?
Cristianity , Islam , Buddism , Ebraism , etc .
A continent is always left out , thinking that Africa has not not been religious to have no religious feels . And you and the Vodoo is not the other that distilside of these religious concepts in the tragic concepts in the tragic senior is not the other than the skills .
What makes the interesting voodoo is the intend of life and death .
So , you know , you 're going to be the spiritues .
The spirits can be invoced by the rank of the Acqua , and they get the rhythm of the dance of the dance of the vial way that for a short moment , the way that for a short moment ,
So , the voodooists , you know , you 're going to talk about God .
We say , " " We say , " God . "
And from the moment you 're married , is the spirit that you , how bad you can do it ?
So you were to these incredible events : follow the voodoo in the state of trance that touch impunts a demonstration rather strengaged to the power of the mind when it 's catalyzed in a state of exremindry .
In all the people who I lived the most extraordinary of the Sierra Nevada Santa Marta Marta , in the Santa Marta , in the Santa Marta Marta Marta , in the Santa Marta Marta , in the Santa Marta Marta , in the Santa Marta , in the Santa Marta Marta , in the Santa Marta Marta Marta , in the Santa Marta , in the Santa Marta Marta Marta Marta , in the Santa Marta Marta Marta Marta Marta Marta Mar
The ancient of the ancient civilization , which once once they were living on the caraibic plants of the Colombia in the conquer of the conquer , the popular massive people who were on the sourcing of the charge of caraibics .
In a continent macchipped of blood , this popular is never conquisted by the Spanish .
But they 're governmented by a clero , but their formation is really extraordinary .
The young people are brought from the families to three or four , and they live in a world of buy and handed in a world of buy and homber in the bottom of the ice for 18 years .
Two double nine years of the noints to reproduce the nine months of the raging of the mother of the mother , now are metaphorically in the ushorically of the Grank Mother .
So , for that time , they 're accultured to the values of their society , values that predicts and only their pyld , and just their pylder , or to say the balance of ecological balance .
At term of this incredible initiation , they 're suddenly out and for the first time in their life , at the age of 18 years , they see an alba . And in that activity of the first ball , when the sun is the valles of the beautiful thing , all that they learned in theory is actually a wild . And the pret is removed in the theory .
" Where ? Proly as I said .
It 's amazing . Now it 's a protect . "
They call the major brothers and say that we , the minors of the destruction of the world .
This level of intuition is extremely important .
When we think about the Ingene and the invote of the Rousseau and the old story of the noble , the wild noble , which is a razer concept in his simplicity or maybe we say that these people are closer to the Earth .
The Ingenes are not feeling populations are not indeboled by the nostalgy .
There 's no space for these things in the Asmaller , or the gelids of the Tibet , but thank you for time and rates , and I think , and the rates , they created a mistic of the Earth 's fabuldly not about the concept of human consciously .
What does that mean ?
And it means that a girl of Ande who grows up the mountain is a spirit of Apu who 's a spirit of Apu who 's going to be a destiny different human being deep , and it will have a different relationship with the mountain that place to a boy of the Montana that 's a mass of rock is a massive mass of rocks that a mountain mass is a frightened mass of rocks .
That 's the dimora , or a little mineral cutal is irrelevant .
What 's interesting is the metaphor that defines the relationship between individual and the natural world .
I grew up in the Britannica 's Columbia credly credying that the forests to be cuted .
And that 's a different human being in the Kwakiutl who believed that the forests are the Hukukukukukuk and the ballast of the paradise and the balls that live in the Hams , the spirits that they live in the Hamsa .
If you start to consider that these cultures can create different reality , you can start to understand some sense of their feeling .
I 've been taken this picture to aprile in the nordoccction .
Mayahuasks about the ayahuasks , the most powerful psycoat , the most powerful psychoptional repertory .
What makes it fascinating the ayahuash is not the potential of the substance of the substance , but his elaboration . It 's composition . It 's composing .
On the one side , this lian lian launch of beta-carboline , harm and harmful , harmful and harmful , laining .
Taking the only planning , you have a bluster that altery , but it 's a little bit about the consciousness , but it 's measured with the leaves of a coffee of the coffee 's family ,
This planning is a lot of powerful triptamine , very similar to serotonin , dimethoxtonina , methoxyptamine-5 , methoxtonine .
If you ever see Yanomami , you 'll get to the hidden the substance that they do from a different species , anchrochror contains .
You can get that poor on the nose is a little bit like to be disdisdiscile from a fixing paper , and land on a bunch of electricity . Risate not creates a distorsion of reality .
I was often psychathy with my professor , Richard Evan Shultes , the man who has been psychaked the bledelical discovery in the ' 30s in Mexico .
I think my textthesis , you can 't classify these tripptamines like hallucinated . You can 't tell no one of being hallucinated . You can 't tell anybody to be training .
It 's possible to be just if you 're asking with other chemicals that dens , you know , the MAOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOr .
Now , the beautiful : Is the cooth-carbs that are in this lian injail , the same kind of necessary to potential the triptamines . The question question is the property : in a flag of 80,000 species , like these people , like these people who are in two deployes , like these people , they create a biochemical version that you can 't find out in this way , they create a biochemical version of the parts ?
We use the great eupher of the proof of the proof and the mistake , that can reveal infrumption .
But if we ask the Indians , they 'll tell us , " The plants are talking about . "
What does that mean ?
This tribes , Cofan , has 17 variety of ayahuasks , which are narrow narrow in the forest , and that you can get into the same species .
If you ask how to stabilize their tassonomed , " I was going to tell us , " I was understood of plants , you don 't know everything ? "
The solution is : you take the 17 variety in a night and each one will dot with a different tone .
With this doesn 't have a bundress in Harvard , but it 's much more interesting that content the stamp .
Now , [ applaushes the problem is that even the problem of us that have heart people who have to heart people find them , but in some way , but somehow reducts in the margins of the history of the respect to our real world , and pass .
In fact , the 21st century , it doesn 't have to remind for his guerre or innovations , but rather as the thing that was where we were stopped and actively actively or the technologic of diversity and cultural diversity of biologic diversity and cultural diversity of the planet . Now the problem is not the change .
All cultures across the centuries are involved in a new chance of life .
And the problem is not technology .
The Indians Sioux not to be Sioux when they put it on the arco and fall like Americans don 't have been stopped to be Americans when they 're stopped and however .
It 's not the change or technology that threw the integrity of the ethnosphere . It 's the power .
The flight flight flight .
And if you give a look at the world , you 'll find that these aren 't destinated cultures .
They 're living and dynamics and spints out of the existence of hyperforces that go beyond their ability to adaptation .
I think you 're tracking in the paa paria ,
a popular nobble , in the southern of the West , a popular , a popular that has lights in the forest to a generation , and now reduced to the servites , and now reverse the prostitution of the rivers , where you can see the fifight that it seems to be able to be able to Meridian , where the daorist Meridic Meridiond , where the daoridic light-off ,
You know , you 're going to be empiing with the dream of the forest .
Or , in the case of Yanomami , are the disease that came with the discovery of the gold .
If we move on on on the Tibet , where I 'm doing a lot of research , you 'll see the hard flight flight flight .
As you 'll know the genocide , the physical extinction , is convicted to universal level , but the ethrodly destruction of a popular life , not just not just not just not just a conviction , but advanced in certain environments , because it 's part of the strategy of development .
And you can 't understand the suffering of Tibet until you go from the beginning .
I 've been on the 6,000 miles from Chengdu in China China , the Western Tibet , and the coming in Lhasa with a young colleague , but only came to Lhasa young colleague , and I realized what we hear .
6,000 sacres in the points and cenjoy .
1.2 million people killed by the military , Cultural Rivolution .
The father of this guy was ascritical to the Panchen Lama .
The Chinese is to say that it was killed to the temple of Chinese invasion .
Her was worse with Santity in Santity during the diaspora that has brought the popular in Nepal .
Sua mother was impried and his colller was rich .
It was brought to the age of two birth in the age of two hidden hidden under his gonna because it wouldn 't have any of him .
The sister , which has been put in reduced reducation .
A day , he had a hot wested a coffigurant Mao and , for this transgression , was mit to the work for seven years .
The Tibet of Tibet can be inoverwhelming , but the recenter of the people is from tener present .
And then , it 's a choice .
We want to live in the world world world world 's monoonia or we want to accoach the world polycles ?
The great fear that we 're going to death the whole range of death said that his biggest fear was that , in our way to this view of love world , not just to see the entire gamorer of human imagination reduced to a limited modality of thinking , but a day we 're going to get from a sleep to a sleep , and we 're going to get from a sleep to the possibility to .
And it 's umillion years old .
The Neolitic Rivolution , who gave us the agriculture , which has been able to fight us to fight the poem of the seme , replacing the poem of the sm , and we talk about 10,000 years ago .
The industrialized world has 300 years old .
That 's the story doesn 't suggests that we have the rispointed to all the challenges we have to deal in the millennia to come .
When to these myriads of cultures of the world is asked , what it means to be human , they responded with 10,000 voices .
And it 's in these answers that we all have the chance to be what we 're , a conscious species , that has to make all the people and all the gives can fight . And there 's great moments of things .
I 've been taken this picture on the northern extended up , when I went to the whaled of the Inuit , and this man , Olaya , Olaya , Olaya , Olaya , and he told me the wonderful story of his grandfather .
The down-government was not always gentle with the Inuit , and in the ' 50s to stabilire our supremise supremice our supremise .
The grandfather of this man refuted to go .
The family , I 'm willing to his life , and he took me all the way .
You have to know that Inuit doesn 't temon the freeer , they exploit .
The packs in the origin were made of pain ,
The grandfather of this man didn 't have been a midle or from the library of the library , which was suffering .
It 's sgattle , it 's cuted the ball in the phants and defecated in your hand . When you did it , you 've been congelated , the has worked a lam.
He sprucized the points on the points of this cross-up , and when it became solid , he killed a dog .
He has been sleep the dog , and created a grid , with the casslethtten , he imbridge another dog and it 's disappear on the bank , coltels , hit in the remains ,
We want to talk about the cavaring with nothing ? [ Risate ] . And this , in different ways , [ Applausi is the symbol of the resilience of the people of the world .
In the aprile of the California government redded the Inuit 's total control of a biggest territory of the California and Texas we put together .
It 's the new paper . It 's called Nunut .
It 's a independent territory . They 're going to all the minerarian territory .
One splendied example of as a natione-state can recognize with his popular .
And finally , I think it 's pretty obvious at least one who 's been in these remote area of the planet , to make it not really remote .
For somebody 's house .
They represent severtions of human imagination that are going to be up the dress . And all of these kids , like dreams , like dreams , as dreams , they become part of the hope .
From , we 've convinced National Geographic , we convince political , never come to nothing .
We believe that the polemies --
[ Applausi is not persuasive , but we believe that stories can change the world , and maybe we 're the best institution to tell stories of the world . Every month of the world . Every month of our website .
156 countries spent our television canal canal canal canal canal .
Our rists are lllletters from millions .
Our work is traveling in the etnosphere to bring our audience in the same places that are going to be able to see how they 're going to be able to be able to , and you hope , abbraccers , and we have to find a style in diversity , and we have to find a style in a pluralist and we have to find a a style in a pluralist world and multicultural daist and multicultural world .
where the wisdom of all people can contribute to our bone-being collective well-being collective .
Thank you .
I 'm going to talk about some things I written in this book that I hope you 've been called the other people who 've heard and proverse some connections , in case not the notails , you don 't notice them .
I want to start with what I call the " dogma official dogma . "
The official dogma 's official dogn ?
The official dogma official dogma , the Western society dogma 's the official dogen , " If we want to massive the well-being of our citizens . "
The reason is , from one side , in fact that freedom is in itself a value , is that it 's a value , is essential for human beings .
The other is that if we 're free , each of us can act for the whole thing to do is to realize that this massimilar of our beneath , no one that we decided to say our .
The way to massive freedom is massive to the choice .
The more choices people have , more lights , and more , and more , the more , the more of the freedom , the more of them .
This , I think , it 's so deeply radicated in society that nobody would be able to put it in dbaber .
And it 's also deeply radicated in our lives .
I 'm going to show you some examples of what progress has made possible .
This is my supermarket . It 's not particularly big .
I 'm going to be a simple note on on the injury .
In my supermarket , there are 175 conditions , and not contact the 10 variety of the olive olive oil and 12 aceters that you can buy to make you a huge number of conditions in the increscement of the increscies in the increscross-walls .
So here 's how the supermarket .
Then you go to the stage of electronic electronic stereo : casse , CD lector , radio , piaright , prlifffer .
And in this single electronic store , there 's a big number of components .
We can make six million and a half million different combinations , using components that there are in a cruster .
You have to admit that there is a lot of choice .
On the world of communications .
Once , when I was a child , you could get all the services services , and pat the pat the pitch that they were fornites by Mom Bell .
You know , you didn 't buy it .
A consequence of that , between the other , was that the phone never break .
These days are gone .
We 've got a variety of telephones , especially between cell phones .
Here 's the cell phones of the future .
My favorite is in the middle , MP3 , cutter , and the ball of the nose , and the hand-up cocket .
If you don 't have seen it in the house , you 're ben certain , you 're going to be able to come .
And what happens is that people go into the stages and it does this question . And you know , what is the answer ? The answer is " No . "
It 's not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn 't make too much .
So , in other things about life that are much more important than the acquiational acquiational , you know the same choices .
Assistence : no longer in the United States that you go from the doctor and the doctor you say what you have to do .
Instead , you go to the doctor , and the doctor says , " OK , we could do A , or B , " Ages , " Are you , " A has these benefits and these risks . What do you want to do ? "
You say , " Dotore , what should I do you do ? "
And the doctor says , " A has these benefits and those risks , and B has these benefits and those . "
" What do you want to do ? "
And you say , " Dotore if she was me , what would you do ? "
And the doctor , " But I 'm not her . "
The result of the call " autonomous " , " expression that makes it look like a beautiful thing .
But it 's actually not that a posting the weight and responsibility to make decisions decisions from somebody who knows something , which is the doctor , to someone else else knows , and it 's not about it -- and so not in the ideal condition to make decisions that patient decisions .
There 's a huge marketing of products , drug people like me and you , that if you think , you know , it doesn 't have any sense , given that we can 't buy them .
But if we can 't buy them , why do you have public ?
The answer is that they want to domesting , we call the doctor to ask him to recipe .
And what 's so fundamental as our identity is our identity is a question of choice , as you see in this dream . " We don 't want to prove the children . " We don 't want to prove the same time . " We don 't have to invent .
And we can reinvented how many times us .
The thing that means that every morning , you have to decide that kind of person want to be .
And it was that the family and marriage , a time the common , and it 's almost almost for anybody , it was that there was that there was a deal , and it was that you could , and you know , and it was that you can .
The only versus it was with who , not when , and even even what do after .
Over , it 's really to play .
I 'm going to be very smart students , and I do 20 percent in less than a time .
And it 's not because they 're not not because they 're less diligent .
but why am I impensierites , I mean , I would you have to tell me , or not ? Would you have to do it now ? "
" Would I say to get a little bit later ? " I have to think before or career ? "
They 're interrogative interrogative .
And they 're trying to answer these questions , even if this implment doesn 't have the companies that asks and not get a bel in my exam .
And they have to do it . They 're important questions .
Now , the work : we 're lucky , like Carl , because technology allows us us to work every minute , every day , from every day , from every day , from every day , from the Hotel Randolph .
In the parenty , there 's a angular , and I don 't tell anybody where the WiFi works .
I don 't tell you , because I want to use it .
What does this mean , this incredible freedom of choice that we have to keep on , continually , and we have to go and on or not .
We can go to see our son playing hot , with the cell phone in a pockberry , Blackberry in the other , and the notebook , typically , on the ginock .
And even if they 're all spent that we see our son , we 're also giving us , we 're also asking , " Do you answer to this called ? "
" Do I have to answer this email ? "
And even when the answer is " no , " everything makes the experience of your son 's party to the experience of your son , you know , in other conditions .
So , anywhere we look at , small things and big , things , and big , materials and life , life is a question of choices .
And once the world was this : Ovreal , there were some possibility , but not all was a question of choice .
The world of today is : The dilemma is , " That 's a positive thing , or negative ? "
The answer is Scil .
The positions we know all about the way , so I 'm going to talk about the negative .
And this choice compories two negative effectively things about people .
The first , paradox , is that it 's a lot of freedom .
With a lot of options between which choose , it becomes very difficult .
I offer an an example : a demand , a conduct on the flan pink .
My colleague has had access to the Vand , the gigantic society , the gigantic society , about a million pink of clients in 2,000 companies .
What she found is that for every 10 solutions that are offered in more , the percentage of adesion , the percentage of two percent .
With 50 four-offer-four-percent of adhhesions than when they are available . Why ?
Because with 50 sources between which choice , is maledtly difficult to decide , and choice is remainly difficult to the inmormoral .
And I still ask the tomorrow , and again , tomorrow , and of course , and I never get .
You know that it doesn 't just mean that these work from old who are going to be able to dogs because they don 't have enough money , it wants to say that the decision is so that they lose the decision is so that they lose the fundamental sources of work .
I don 't participating , they 're losing to five to the dator of work , which would be well displace .
So , the paralysis a consequence of the trouble .
And I think it makes the world that .
" And finally , for the ethchetchup , or maionese , or maionese ? "
You 'd have to take the right decision , if it 's for ethernity , right ?
You don 't want to choose the wrong , and you don 't want to choose the wrong condition .
So this is the first effect . The second is that we also can avoid paralysis and do a choice , at the end we 're less subsidied by the result of how we 'd have been with less options between what you .
And this for different reasons .
One of these is that with many people who choose , if you buy a little bit of a and it 's not perfect , it 's not easy to imagine that you could do a different choice that you could have been better . And that 's what happens is that the alternative . And that 's what happens is that the alterny of choice , and the replace the sodgives the soddness of choice , and the replace diant by decision ,
And even when it was a very good decision .
There 's more choices .
And also , there 's what economists call constoopportunity .
Dan Gilbert has clean very well stamattine as the value of things we do depends on what we 're talking about .
And the rest , when there 's a lot of options , it 's easy to representing the alternative characternative articulations and be less subsidies in the option that you 're choice .
Here 's an example . I 've been schooling with all the ones that are not New York .
But that 's what you would probably think .
There 's this copy in the Hamptons .
A blow place .
Spiach . Ottime . Ottime . It 's all about them .
Not nothing . But what he thinks is , " Well , the maldresh , it 's Agobox . "
" All my neighbors in Manhattan are on . "
" I could talk about how to you in front . "
And it 's going to go to the idea that 's loss -- every day -- the possibility of parking where it wants .
The constoopportunity decrease the subddisfation for what we have , even when choice was a cell .
And the most of the options that we have to consider , the most of the acactive active actions , you 'll find out how consto-opportunity .
Here 's another example .
This is a lot of things .
It 's about the time , and maybe a living slowly .
But the most important point is that you choice , you know , you 're not doing other .
The things that we don 't choose to be a lot of attractive , that can make less attractive what we do .
And third point : spiral growing of expectations .
I tried it on my skin buying a new couple of jeans .
I 'm almost always jeans .
And once the jeans were just like a bought , and they were besty and they were besty , and they were discomodissies , just after I had a lot of times , and they were starting to go well .
So , I went to buy a couple of a new when the old people were gone , and I said , " I need a couple jeans , this is my cutting . "
The commit to me said , " Look , what 's going , and the phit ? "
Who wants to the cernier , or the bottons ? " Stonehed " or " " acidwashed " ? "
" Who wants stract ? "
" Woman : Would you like to get a bla -- " Continured to get it .
I was sbalored , and after a little bit , I want to say , " I want the guy that -- that was the only guy , " Don 't have a idea what was , so for a time , and I 'm going to get the jeans , and then I 'm going to get the best pair of a pjeans that I ever had .
It was the massive . With all that choice I had the best .
But I felt a worse .
Why ? I wrote a whole book to understand it .
The reason I was worse is that with all the choice is that with all the choice were very high , jeans had to be perfect .
I was at the beginning , I didn 't expected to do nothing about exceptional , when there was one guy , but when it was 100 different , accidents , at least one had to be perfect .
And what I was buying was good , but not perfect .
After the choice with what I was trying to do with what I was trying to do is in confronted to the expectations .
The add of options in life doesn 't do that increased the expectations that these are respect to the excellence of options .
And this will proof less subdisfation , even when the results are good .
Nobody in the marketing world , if you realize .
Because if they knew it , you don 't know what I 'm talking about .
The truth is more than the truth .
" You know , " The reason it was worse , " The reason that was better when it was worse was worse , when it was worse , it was still possible to meet the surprised .
Over the world we live in -- opulent , industrialized , industrialized citizen , the massive thing that we can hope is that things we can hope is that things are to the altitude .
You never have surprised as your expectations , my expectations , my expectations , you 're ingigantic .
The secret of happiness -- what you 're here -- is , " Baxis , you want . "
I mean , a little biographic moment -- which is really married and my wife is really amazing .
I couldn 't do it . I don 't have been contempted .
But it 's not always a bad thing .
And then , a consequence of buying a couple of jeans discoveries when there 's just that jeans is that when you 're not satissssatissssatic , and you know ? "
" Who is responsible ? " , the answer is clear .
The world is responsible . What can you do that ?
When there are hundreds of jeans , and you buy a bought , and you ask who ask you who ask who is the responsible , is the closer , is the closest that responsible you .
You could do better .
With hundreds of variety , there are not scapes for insuccess .
So when people take decisions , even if the result is , you feel like , you feel insoddisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisappeared .
In the last years , the depression is exploded in the industrialized world .
I think a significant factor -- not the only , but important -- of this honave is that people have a depression is that people have a delude experience because it standard are too high .
And when they have to explain this situation that cold is they think that cold is their .
So the final result is that we 're better , objectively , but we feel worse .
Let me give you a remind .
This is the official dogma , what we all take for good and it 's completely flew . It 's not true .
There 's no doubt that a little choice is better that you don 't have any deal with it , but it doesn 't really have to do it .
There 's a critical value . I don 't know what it 's .
But I 'm sure we 've been overcome from a piece of the level where the choices are better .
Now , from political point of view -- I almost finished -- from political point of view , the nocccracks is the following .
What it allows this choice in the industrial society is the rechef material .
There are many places in the world , and you know , where the problem is not that they have a choice .
The problem is that they have too pop .
So the factory that I 'm talking about is a malbeing exclusive of modern modern society , rich society .
And what it does depress and climbing is this : Steve Levitt , and what 's been constststicks to the baby of undry and discoveries of money .
I mean these choices , complicated and available , it 's not that they just inuseful .
They 're very willing by the writing .
They 're worse .
If a little bit of what in our society is allowed in the company , you have too much choice in those where people have too much a few possibility , it would not only have their life to improve .
This is what economists call a paretary improvement .
A redistribution re-distribution is all -- not just to poor -- because of this choice in excess that we get us .
And to conclude , " You can get this , you can become everything you want to " --
You , you think , " But what 's it creates that fish ? "
" That 's obvious that you can 't do something in a glass . "
A castrated view , a limited view of the world --
and I 'm going to interpreted this so , at the beginning .
But then , I think , instead , I realized that that that the fishes the long way .
Because the reality of the fact is that if you 're managed in frantums , so that you can 't get freedom . You get the paralysis .
If you break the bocting way that everything is possible possible demination .
You can get the paralysis , and you get the benbe .
Everybody needs a sphere .
This is almost certainly too quickly , maybe even for the fish , and certainly for us .
But the absence of a symboard is a recipe for infelity and , for the ruin .
Thank you heart .
