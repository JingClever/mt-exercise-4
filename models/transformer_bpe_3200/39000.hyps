And last year I showed these devices to show that the artical ice ice ice ice ice ice ice ice , which was almost three million years old had the size of 48 the size of the United States , it 's 48 percent .
But this underestimates the gravity of the problem because it 's not shows the executive of the ice .
The artical hot is , in a way , the clear clear of the global climate system .
It expands up winter and you 're ritiate .
The next slide is going to be a rapid carrelated on the last 25 years .
Spice ice have been signed in red .
You can see , they expand until blue wall .
That 's the ice in winter , you know , you know , you know ,
You can see that the so-in-indeed ice , of five years or more , is like blood , which is like blood , which is in here from the body .
And in 25 years , it 's been there .
This is a problem because the heating interest the ice heat of the ice ice ice of the arctic ocean where there are huge amounts of coal-, which , the motion , the moves , they 're transformed into the microbes .
I think about the totality of pollution pollution , that amount of global warming , that could doubleet , super-scale point .
In some short lags in Alaska , the meter is already rebolling from water .
The professor Katey Walter in the University of Alaska was a team in a team in a team in a team , I was a very low last hell .
Video : Wow ! Al Gore : Wow ! The question is if we 're going to be .
A reason is that this termal exchange Groenland from the northermal .
This is a river river in the hythy regime .
And he had never reached levels .
This is the Kangerlussulussuaq , in the southwest of the Groenland .
If you want to know how the sea level of the sea level of ice for ice the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the sea .
These currently currently .
Anowhere on the planet : Antarctica , the largest block of ice the planet .
The last month of scientists have dichieve that the pathway is in negative , and that the Westergative Antarctica , who pogy on some islands , is particularly quickly quickly in the month .
This is about six feet of the boat , like , Groenland .
Sulil , the Himalayas , the third largest block of ice , and they see a few years ago , that few years ago were glaciers .
40 percent of the world population required half of the world 's population from that melting .
Sulle Ande : this glacier is the source of the potaable water source of this city .
The landed is increased .
But when it diminues it , the same happens to the water .
In California , the newnow on Sierra Nada is about 40 percent .
The hydrogen kiss are in crisis .
The predictions , as you 've read , are severe .
The growing safety in the world leads to a remarkable increase .
The environmental disasters are increasing a rhythm outside the normal and without precedented .
Four times more numbers over the last 30 years of respect to 75 .
This is a whole thing that is unsustainable .
If you look at it in the context of the context .
In the last five years , we 've added 70 million tons of CO2 every 24 hours -- 25 million tons of a day .
Look at the area of the oriental Pacific , the American American , towards west , and both of the parts of the Indian subcontinent , where there 's a radical oxygen in the ocean .
The major causes global warming , together to deforestation , which is 20 percent of them , is the fossil fuel fuel fuel .
The oil is a problem , and the carbon is even worse .
The United States is one of the two more emissions , together to China .
And it was proposed to build a lot of other coal of coal .
But we 're seeing a direction of a direction .
These are the anullates in the last few years and some alternative proposes .
But anyway , there 's a political loast in our country .
The carbon industries and oil have spent 250 million dollars in the last year to promote carbon industries , which is a oxymic .
That image me something --
Natal , in Tennessee , where I live , there was a 3.8 billion gallons of carbon dioxide .
You might see it on news .
This is the biggest flowing of last in America .
It happened around Natale .
The publicity of one of the carbon industry was this .
Video : I 'm going to be a carbon is an allegro , and happy .
It 's abundant here in America , and it will grow our economy .
Frosty carbon is increasingly more .
It 's good price , and it 's workers keep the pend .
Al Gore : So , here 's a lot of the West Virginia .
The biggest mineral society on the mountains is Massey Coal . This is his administrator .
Video : Don Blankenship : I 'll be clear -- Al Gore , Nancy Peloid -- Harry Regigigiven -- they don 't know what they 're talking about .
Al Gore : So the Alleance for the Clima has launched two campaign .
This is a one of them , one part .
Video : Acore : Alil COALergy : Alil COALergy : Actually , like a sery threat to our business .
So our priority is to invest a lot of money in a large amount of money in a effort to make public and confused the truth of carbon .
Actually , carbon is not sports .
We think it 's clean -- it 's also a good profum .
So not cups of climate change .
Let me do it .
Video : Carbone pubon the lit .
So let 's take a turn into a structure at the ladies in a structure on the lap .
Straordinary ! The machines are a little noise , but that 's the sound of coal technology .
The coal consumption is between the major causes of global warming , but the remarkable technology that you can see everything .
Take a look : this is the hot technology of clean carbon diodiergy .
Al Gore : Infine , the positive alternative positive is connetts to the economic issue and the national security .
Video : Comment : America is in crisis ; the economy , national security ,
The file that connects all : our dependence from fossil fuel fuel , like carbon dioxilium and oil imported .
Now , there 's a new audace , a solution to go out out .
Repower : 100 percent clean energy in 10 years .
A plan to put America to work , make us more sure , and help us stop the global warming .
Finally , a solution that is that that we solve our problems .
Reacts . Scover more .
Al Gore : This is the last .
Video : Comment : It 's about re-energy .
One of the fastest ways to bring to the dependence of the fuel that they kill our planet .
Compars : The future is here . I 'm a new energy network .
Compars number two : New 2 : New investments for very well retribes .
Comment : Repower . It 's time to be realists .
Al Gore : A old proverbio African , says , " If you want to go veloes , go to fast .
If you want to go back together . "
We have to go away , fast .
Thank you very much .
LHC : Last year I introduced to TED ,
And I promise to come back to how the car works .
So here I was . And for those that the other time there was no , the LHC is the biggest scientific experiment ever there was -- 27 miles of circumstances .
Her task is to reconstructions that were at least less than a billion of a second .
And that 's just ambicracy .
This is the car under Ginevra .
We 're going to photographing these min-Big Bang inside the detectors .
This is what I work . It 's called ATLAS -- is about 44 meters and has a diameter diameter diameter .
This is an ATLAS . It 's a spectacular picture , so you can see proportions .
Ten September , we 've accesum the car for the first time .
And this picture was taken by ATLAS .
It was because of immense festeggiving in control room .
It 's a picture of the first fashion that was the LHC , entering around in collision , in collision , with a LHC , and spreading particles out the detector .
In other words , when we see that image the 10 settember , we realized that the machine was going to work , which is a great winner .
I don 't know if it was this to exultate more or that , when someone went to Google and see the initial page was this .
That means we have had a cultural impact beyond to the scientific .
About a week later , there was a problem with the car , just had to these files here -- these dories .
These flects flects the car is where the car works at the massive power of the power of the power of the power of the way .
Now , technical technical technical , you know , and they 'll say , " It 's not true . I 'm files too sotars . "
And they can do it because when they are very cosi-called superconfufuels .
So , at least 271 degrees , at least 271 degrees , at least , these files can bring that current .
In one of the juntures between the most novemile of magnetic magneti , there was a fect of a factory .
So the files surity , they 're surprising a slightly , and the 13,000 leaving practices .
This was the result .
Now , this is even more impressive if you think that these magnetes more than 20 tons , and that have moved from about 30 centimeters .
They were damage to about 50 magneti .
We had to take them , what we then did .
We rested them and uploved .
They 're now coming back all the subground .
By the end of the LHC is going to be back to the back of the LHC ,
We 're going to access it , and we expect it to get to the data or right , and we keep this so our adventure to discover what are the morning that are the universe .
Now , of course , in a way , these accidents reach the debate on the value of science and engineering in front of science and engineering in front . It 's easy to be to conviction .
I think the fact that it 's so hard , the fact that I think it 's the value of things like LHC .
I 'd like to end with the words of a English scientist , Humphrey David , the defense of the income experiments of his pupille , his pupille was , his pupille was , his pupile of human mind how much of the mind that the idea of science is that the human mind that the mind of science is definitive , that our triumphon-definitive scientist , that we don 't have any new monstrict , and that we don 't have any new monade , and that not conquote . "
Thank you .
I want to start asking you to rethink of when , as children , as children , played with the morning .
While you can understand them and grade them , and get them , take them and move , learny and move them , and then you know , and we 're actually going to tell them and solve problems .
The space reasoning is deeply connected to the way we understand most of the world around us .
So , from the information inspired by the ured utility of our interaction with physical objects , together to my consultants , and my collaborator Jeevan Kalanithi , I started asking , " And if we use a computer , instead of having the multiple , like a poly-pastrong , we were just going to get a little bit of information with both their hands , and we could deal with a wireless of them ,
and sistn it to our please ?
The question was so interesting that we decided to explore the answer , building the Siftable .
In a few words , a Siftable is a big interactive computer like a cook-based computer .
In a few words , a Siftable is a big interactive computer like a cook-based computer .
You can move them with his hand , can see them , " between them , feel their movement and they have a screen and a radio wireless .
But sometimes , are physical objects like the morning , like the morning , you can simply go through it .
The Siftable is the example of a new ecosystem tools to manipulate information .
And as they become more physical , aware of the movement , of others , as they become more physical , consciousness of their movement , of how we moved , we can explore new new and different estyles of interaction .
I 'll start with some simple example .
This Siftable is configured to show video : if you 're going to stop it in a direction , the video rotable , the video rotable , we 'll rotable to show of video .
These interactive portrait has to be aware of others .
If I ran them , they 're interested in what they 're around .
If they come around , they can see it , and they can do it a little bit .
If they come around , they can see it , and they can do it a little bit .
They also have their movement and inclination .
We then realized that one of the interesting implications of the interaction was to use common management , for example , to " a color like , " a color like , " a liquid .
In this case , we have three Siftable of configured as a bucknic , and I can use them to versate color in that central , where you mix .
and I can use them to be a cool in that central , where you 're mischieve .
We can do it too , we can put a little bit a place .
There are also beautiful possibilities of learning , like language , like language , mathematics and logic games where people can try to things quickly , and see the results immediately .
I 'm now --
This is a Fibonaccount that I do with a program of equations .
Here we have a game of words that is in the middle of Scarabeo and Boble .
Pratically , at every turnal turnal you get a letter case on every Siftable , Pratically , at every turnal you get a letter case on any place in Siftable , and as you try to compare that he controlling a dictionary .
And then , after about 30 seconds you get a new set of reading and new possibilities to try .
Thank you .
And that 's the children came to the Media Lab , I did this way that tribe , and I spent them up and I spend a video .
They are very pleased .
And one of the interesting things like this kind of applies of this is that you don 't have to give people a lot of education .
You just say , " Compon words , " and they know exactly what to do .
Here 's where other people try it .
This is our youngest tester header , there on the right .
It actually wanted to stop them .
They were only morning in the morning , for him .
Now , this is a appliasle of a interactive cardboard .
We wanted to build a tool for the apprentice of the Lui language is Felix .
It can put new characters in the scene , lift and they 're associated with them .
It can put new characters in the scene , lift and they 're associated with them .
So , it 's going to get the sun .
Video : The sun is surprising .
David Merrill : Now she took a tretor in the scene .
Video : The arange .
Bel work !
So , the Siftable , and put them close close to interact with characters --
Video : Bau !
... inventing their story .
Video : Hi !
DM : It 's a story with open open , and it can decide him how you do it is .
DM : It 's a story with open open , and it can decide him how you do it is .
Video : Fall , yellow .
DM : The last example I have time to show you is a tool , is an instrument , made of sampioning and execececececutive music .
It 's a tool , made of recent , to sampionees and executives music .
The Siftable here are sound as a bass , and the bacteria .
Each of these have four different variations , and you can choose that to use .
You can also put these sound in a sequence to get to your please .
And just to modify it by doing a sound and a sequence .
These are actually able effectively I can control from vive , like reverbs and filter .
It 's a particular sound and then fires to fight .
And then there are the general effects as time and volume , that they applied to sequence .
Let 's look at how it works .
Video : We 'll start putting a basis in two Siftable in two Siftable , we put them in a series , we put it in a series , we add the other basic basic .
Now I put a bass line .
Video : I add the percussions --
Video : I 'll take the filter in the bacteria , so I can control the live effect .
Video : I can fast the whole sequence of the entire sequence , by the way or another .
Video : I 'm going to add the bottom of the lower to give more expression .
Video : I can refuse the sequence of the flight .
So I don 't have to planning it before , but I can improvise , make it longer or .
And now , finally , I can spray the whole sequence of the Siftable on the left , the Siftable .
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is to build new mo-machine interfaces more and more sounds like our brain and body .
And today , I 've had time to show you one of the results of this path , and some chance we try to bring out of the lab .
The concept I want to transmit is that 's coming to this new generation of designed to interact with digital media , to interact with digital media , that will bring information in our world in the way we want .
Thank you very much .
I don 't see the time to talk to all of you .
I 'm a writer .
It 's my profession , but it 's more than that , obviously .
It 's love and the fascint of my life .
And I don 't expect that it can change .
But , said , something particular has been recently in my life and my career , who led me me to realibrate the entire relationship with this job .
The particular thing is that I recently written this book , this biography called " Mangia , Ama , " which , diversally from my precedented books , for some reason came out in the world and became a big , besseller , interational ,
And the result is that everywhere , people treat me as if I was conconvicted .
It 's true -- convicted , convicted !
They 're all going to be worried and they say , " Don 't I 'm afraid to do better ?
Don 't you fear to keep writing for all of life without being able to create a book that can be able to create a book that can important to someone ? "
What can you be importantly to someone ? "
It 's unsees , you know .
But it could go worse , except that I remember that more than 20 years ago , when I started to say , I was a teenager -- I wanted to be a writer .
I would go to meet the same reaction that was based on the fear .
And people said , " Don 't tems to be able to successful ?
Do you don 't care that the umillion-to-baby .
Do you 're fear to do this wildlife without anything that anything that is ever going to be out and die on a cue . Do you know , the mouth of all the failure to love to love your own own life . "
So , you know .
The answer -- the short answer to all of these questions is , " Yes . "
Yeah , I 'm afraid of all those things .
I 've always had fear .
And I also have fear to many other things that people can 't guess .
It 's like the algas and other things .
But , as it 's about the writing what I thought and I was wondering , I was why ?
Is it rational ?
It 's logical that anybody should wait to be very frightened by a job that you feel that I 've been born to do .
But what is so particular in the impress that we have to make us nervous health care about mental health , in a way that other people don 't do ?
How my father , for example , he was a chemical engineer and I don 't remember one time in his 40 years of activity that he was asked if he was asked if he was to be engineer ?
There was never -- that block of engineers John , how does it go ?
Don 't work , you know ?
Onestly , chemical engineers like group don 't have a group of being not , in the centuries , drive the reputation of being alcolied maniaces .
We have writers , we have enough this reputation , and not just writers , but you know , we have this reputation of being enormous .
And it 's not to look at the sad of contexts of the deaths of magnifeth of the deaths of creative magnifeth of them .
And the ones that don 't have any of the things that are not suicidunded by their dungs .
Norman Mailer , before I died , in the last interview , said , " Our my book killed me a little more more " an extraordinary rmation about his life .
But we don 't beat my boy when we feel that that we 've heard this stuff so long that in some way we have completely interior and accepted the notion that creativity and suffering are somehow tied and that art , at the end , it 's going to conducil .
And the question I want to ask all of this today is , are you agree with this idea ?
You know this thing -- because it 's looking at the centimeter of distance to me not well this support .
I think it 's hated .
And I think it 's dangerous and I don 't want to see the perpetuate in the next century .
I think it 's better to encourage our great minds to live .
And I certainly know that , in my case -- in my situation -- it would be very dangerous to start fuse out of my career .
It 's really -- I mean , you look at , I 'm pretty young , I have about 40 years .
I still have about four decades of work in me .
And it 's very likely that I write about now , it 's going to be judged by the world like the work that came out after the spent of my last book .
I 'm going to be slavery because we 're all more or not here -- it 's likely that my big successful is to my shoulder .
Oh , Gesus , who thought !
You know this is the kind of thought that leads a person to start drink in the nine of the morning and I don 't want to do it .
I would keep doing this work that I love .
So , the question gets , how ?
And so it seems to me , after many reflective , that the way to keep writing is to create a psychological construction , OK ?
I have to find a way of security between me , I 'm writing , I 'm writing , and my natural anxime that I 'm going to get to do it . And , as I was trying to find other society to see if they could have more and more healthy ideas to see if they could have better ideas and more healthy ideas to see if they could have better ideas and more healthy ideas , and I was looking for other society to see if they could have more healthy ideas have more ,
about how to help people with creative people management to manage the emotivity of creativity .
And that research has led me to the Greark and the Rome .
I guitem because I 'm in a circle and then comes back .
In the ancient Grex and ancient Rome -- people didn 't seem to believe that creativity came from men , OK ?
And it was thinking that creativity was this required to be and they were to men from some distant , and that they were in men from some source distant and unknown , for distant reasons .
The Greeks were called these watermajor divins of creativity " demon . "
Socrate , wonderful , believed to have a demon that , elargggeity from remote .
The Roomands were the same idea , but they called that kind of spirit , without a genius .
Which is great , because Roands were not really thought a genius was somebody who was particularly smart .
They believe it was this kind of a genius was this kind of divine that was literally in the walls of an artist , a little bit like the elpho Dobby , and that they came out to see the job of hidden , the job of the artist and models the job of that work .
Extional -- here 's the distance of which I talk about -- that psychological construction that you protects you protect to you from your job .
And they all knew it was how it was doing , right ?
So the anti-artists were protected to things , like , for example , too much narcisism , right ?
If your work was exceptional , you couldn 't take all the place , all of the deserve , they all knew that you were helped by this incorporean genius .
If your job failed , it was not all your hit , right ?
Everybody knew it was your genius to be a unable .
And so people han conceived creativity in Ocdent for a long time .
And then the Renaissn , and all this big idea , and we had this great idea ; we put the human being over the universe over all of the universe and mysteries and without leave space creatures that detect detected by divinity .
This was the principle of humans and the people started thinking that creativity was completely from hydivided .
And for the first time in history , you start to refit to this or artist as a genius , like a person with genius .
And I have to tell you , I think it was a big mistake .
I think it allowed someone , a simple person to believe that they 're like a recipient like source , the essence and source of all the mysteries , creativity , unknown ethernal and etherny , both of human fragile psychologists .
It 's like to ask someone to enjoy the sun .
It 's a demand destores all these inexecutives on performance .
And I think it was this pressure that it was about 500 years old .
And , if this is true , and I think it 's the question , and now ?
Can we do that ?
Maybe I can go back to a more ancient understanding of human relationship and creative mystery .
Or maybe not .
Maybe we can 't sing 500 years of rational thinking in a 18 minutes in a talk .
And there 's probably people in the audience who would have a legitimate scientific , on the notion of , so they follow the people by spend of their projects .
I 'm going to try to tell you all about this thing .
But the question I 'd like to ask is -- why not ?
Why don 't you think that way ?
Because it has more sense of anything else that ever ever ever ever heard of explanation of the impreveality of the creative process .
A process that , as anyone who ever tried to do something -- so , we 're all here -- you don 't recompored .
And in fact , in fact , sometimes it can be completely paranoral .
I did this meeting with recently poetry Ruth Stone , who has now 90s , but that was a poetor for all of life and said that he was a poetry for all of life and said that he was in the rural Virginia , working out in the fields , and he fellow it , in if a poem was in the landscape .
And he said he was like a frague of air .
And he was rotolling to her from the landscape .
He felt it , because he was going to get the ground under his feet .
He knew he had one thing to do to do at that point and was of , his words , " running as a math . "
And it 's going to household and it was going to be to have a piece of paper and a pencil , and a pencil enough , as the trust and a math enough , and the mistake it , collects it and grade it on the page .
Sometimes it can be able to be fast enough , so he 's going , so he goes and correcves without able to get to home and the poetry her rotoling through and she would continue to rotolate through the landscape , and he would continue to reach through the landscape , looking for , as she said , " another poet . "
And then there were those times -- this piece I 'm never going to -- there were moments where it was almost losing , OK ?
So , he was running home and he was looking for paper and the poetry was going through , and he was a pencil in the way that he was going , and then he said , that was like if you get away with the other hand and step .
He used to be poem from the tail and remain it in his body and transcscscreamed it on the page .
And in these cases , the poetry would be presented on the perfect page , but the last word at the contrary , the first .
So when I felt that -- I was crazy , it 's exactly the same thing that I thought I was really the same thing as my creative process .
I don 't all my creative process -- I 'm not a conconconconconconconconconconconconconconconconconconconconconconconconviction .
I 'm a mulo , and my way to work is , wake up to wake up at the same horarian every day and work and pass on on top of it .
But even I have a waste , I 've been brought on that thing , sometimes .
And I guess that many of you , I think that I 'm han .
You know , even if the job and ideas came to me from a certain source , I can 't be wilestly about .
And what is this ?
And how can we relate it in a way that we don 't lose your head , but rather , what do we do we have to do in sparts ?
As I 'm as the best contemporary example I have is the Myan musician Waits , which I have been several years ago for a newspaper .
We were talking about this , and you know , Tom , for the majority of life was the incarnation of the tomental artist tmented contemporary , trying to control , management , dominating these species of impulses .
But then he was going to get caught , and one day as he was driving on a highway in Los Angeles , changed all over him .
It was going to be a veyes and all of a train this little framment of appelody , which comes to his head as inspiration , elusive and alectant , and the desider , and the desider , but it 's not about how to take it .
It 's not a piece of paper , it 's not a math , it 's not a register .
So he starts to feel this kind of old anxium growing up in him , " I 'm going to lose , and I 'm going to have obsessionated by this sessional sonal sessional sessionate sessional sessionate .
I 'm not good enough , and I can 't do it . "
And instead of going to stop .
He brought the entire process and made something completely new .
He just just the sky and said , " Scut , you know , I 'm not driving ? "
" Do you think it can write a song now ?
If you really want to exists , you get back to a moment , you can take care of you .
Otherwise , you go to main some of today .
You go to disturbing Leonard Cohen . "
And his process worked changed after that .
It was not the work , the job was still darkness as a always time .
But the process , and the fish anxiety that was attended to have been released to the genius , the genius that was out of him , and he was going to get it back to where was coming , realized that it was not to be a thing and remaized .
but you know , this peculiar bizarre , wonderful , coaboration , a conversation between Tom and this strange , and this external thing .
So , as I felt that story started to change a little bit , the way I was working and I 'm already saving a time .
This idea , I 'm going to save when I was writing " Mangia , Ama , " and fall in one of those cave disperation where we 're working on something and we can 't start thinking that we 're working on something and we can 't start thinking that it 's going to be a disaster , that 's going to be the worst book I 've ever written .
Not just bad , right , right ? It 's not just the worst book deaths .
And I started thinking about therefore this project .
But then I remembered to me to the air and I tried to get it .
So I stood my face on the handle , and I was going to make my comments to a vacuum of the room .
And I said , " Loook , what , both of you know , both of you know that if this book is not going to be bright , not my ?
Because as I see I 'm putting all I have , I don 't have that much of that .
So if you want to be better , you have to introduce you and do your part .
OK . But if you don 't do it , you know what , I don 't do anything .
I 'm going to write the same because it 's my work .
And I 'd like to be a flied that I 've been presented to do my part , " Because -- at the end is that , OK -- in the end of North Africa , people were all sacred for the dances of the light , dances and music that went on and sacred to the stuff .
And they were always magnificent , because the dances were professional and they were fantastic .
But every while , rarely , something happened , and one of these artists became transcending .
And I know you know what I 'm talking about , because you all of the point , a performance so .
It was like time , and the dancer walked through a kind of land-up , and it was not doing anything different from the usual , like 1,000 notes before , but all it was trained .
And suddenly , it doesn 't seem like a human .
But he 's going to go from the diinside and below illuminated in the fuoco of divinity .
And when this happened , the time , people knew what was , they called it .
They had their hands and start singing , " Allah , Allah , Allah , God , God , " God , God , " God , "
That 's God , you know .
And it 's a historical note -- when the Mori invaded Spain , I was this habits with them and the pronounced in the centuries from " Allah , Allah , " to " Ole , the " Ole , " Ole , " which you can still feel in the courries or in the flamh .
In Spain , when a artist did something impossible , and magic , " Allah , Allah , the Allah , I was , " unable , " incomprehensible , " ecof God .
And it 's great because we need it .
But , the problem comes day after the dancer , the dancer itself , when you get up and discover that are 11 in the morning of Martedesh and last last of God is no longer .
It 's just a bad mortal with glasses , and maybe it 's not going to be able to get that altitude .
And maybe nobody will sing the name of God 's still going to go , and what does it have to do with the resof his life ?
It 's hard .
This is one of the more paorous reconciliations to make in a creative life .
But maybe it 's not to force be so much if you can 't believe , in mostly , that the most extraordinary aspects of your being come from yourself .
But you would just believe that you 're going to prested from an inimaginable source of this team of life that is where you have to go to somebody else when you finished .
And , you know , if we think it 's it 's going to change .
And so I started thinking about it , and it 's sure , as I thought I was a different time during the work of the book that I 'm going to give it , the dangerous , attesissues , followed , attesissues followed to my great successful success .
And what I have to keep saying when I feel electritric .
It 's not just your job .
It 's a presenting way to your part , any can be .
If you have to dance , you get it to dance .
If the divine , I 'm assigned to you make some kind of wonderful wonderful , for one , for just a moment through your effort , then " Ole . "
Otherwise , you do the same your dance .
And " Ole ! " to yond the same .
I think , and I think I should teach it .
" Out ! " to yourself , even for having had human love and headath-head of wildlife and headathly tale .
Thank you .
Thank you .
June Cohen : Ole !
As you know I 've been talking about some of these projects on the human genome , what can mean and on the discovery set of new genes .
We 're now starting a new path . We started digitize the biology and now we 're starting to digital code , we 're going to into a new phase of biology , designing and synthesizing life .
We 've always been trying to ask great questions .
" What is life ? " It 's something that many biologists have been trying to understand sunning levels .
We tried different approaches , reduced it to the minimes .
We 're digitizing from almost 20 years now .
When we sequenced the human genome was to go from the analome of the biology of the world in the digital world .
Now , we 're going to regenerate life , or create new life from this digital universe ?
This is the map of a small organism , Mycoplasma genitalium , which is the smallest genome , which is the smallest genome of the lab .
And we tried to reduce the genome to create one more smaller .
We can eliminate a hundred genes of genes of about 500 .
But when we look at his metabolic map , it 's relatively simple than our own metabolic .
We have to believe me , that 's simple .
But when we look at all the genes that we can eliminate , one at the time , it 's very unlikable that this can bring to a living cells .
So we decided the only way to procrete was synthesize this chromosome , so that we could change the components to bring some of these fundamental questions .
And so we started the adventure of " Can Can we synthesize a chromosome ? "
Can the chemistry to try to produce these big molecules that we never managed to create before ?
And in case , we do we can make a chromosome ?
A chromosome is just a piece of chromosome of material chemical material .
The speed with which we 're able to digitize life is growing to exponentially exponentially .
Our ability to write the genetic code , instead , proprise , but it 's improving , but it 's improving .
And our most recent results that we get to a exponential curve .
We started over 15 years ago .
And the process has been asked a lot of passages , starting with bioethical revision before we started the first experiments .
But we discovered that synthize DNA is very hard .
There are tens of thousands of machines in the world that make small DNA segments , in the world that are producing small segments , and it 's a degenerative process : the segments that are longer , there are more mistakes there are .
So we had to develop a new method to assembly these framments and error the mistakes .
And this was our first attempt , in starting to digital information of the genome of Phi I174 .
It 's a little virus that kills .
We designed the fragments , actually , effectuated the correction of errors and get a DNA molecule .
The interesting part is when we got this piece of inert chemical material , and we put it in the bacteria , the bacteria have started reading this genetic code and produring the viral particles .
The viral particles have been released by the cells , they 've come back and they destroyed the E.
I 've been talking about recent with the oil industry , and they 're certainly saying they have to do this model .
They 've been playing more than you .
We believe this is a situation where software actually actually can build its own hardware in a biological system .
But we wanted to do things in big .
We wanted to build the whole chromosome of the bacteria .
They 're more than 580 thousands of genetic code .
So we thought we 're going to build it in the size of the virus , so that we can change the cassets , so that we can change the components of a living cells .
Does design is critical , and if we start with digital information in a computer , these have to be very accurate .
When we sequencenced this genome for the first time in 1995 accuractivity was a mistake for every 10 thousand bases .
We discovered , we 've been resequenced , 30 mistakes . If we had that original sequence we would never be able to do it work .
One part of the process is to design a 50 segments that overlap with all the other 50 letters to build underneath the smaller of 50 letters to build underneath smaller toes that work together .
We 're going to try to unique elements here .
You probably read that we 're probably read that we put in the filigate .
So think about this : we have a genetic code based on four letters : A , C , C , G and T.
Three of those letters put together with about 20 lominoacids , and there 's a specific order to reader every lominoid .
So we can use the genetic code to write words , sentences , thoughts .
What we did at the beginning was autographed .
Some have been dollar from the fact that it wasn 't poetry .
We designed these segments to just join them together with enzymes .
There are enzymes that repair them and put them on .
And we started assembly assembly , starting with segments , starting with segments , uns in a way that they can form 72 miletter up to 24 thousands of letter unique ,
We 've produced these segments in abundance , so that we can sequence them , because we 're trying to create an extremely robstic processing -- how you 'll see in a minute .
We 're trying to automatize the process .
So , this seems to be the tabellon of a low playground .
When we get these very long , over 100 miles , more than 100 miil , we will not grow more directly in E.
It 's to the limit of modern biology tools of molecular biology .
So we 've been looking at other mechanisms .
We knew about another mechanism called recombination omologue , which in biology uses to repair the DNA to join a DNA to join a check to join the DNA .
Here 's an example .
This organism , called Deinococcus radiodurans , can absorb three million radiation .
You can see in the upper square like his chromosome like the chromosome of the way .
In 12 -- 24 hours it 's been reported exactly as it was before .
There are thousands of organisms that they are able to do it .
These organisms can sit completely .
They can live under empty .
They 're absolutely sure life in space , and you know , you know , to find new areas of water .
ASA showed it , NASA showed this that this is .
This is a picture of molecule that we built using these processes , just using the yeast design of segments , and just using the segments to put on the segments .
The yeast assemble them self-assemble .
This image was not taken with a microscope electric microscope , but with a regular microscope .
It 's a molecule so we can see it with a microscope .
These are pictures that cover a period of about six seconds .
This is the advertising that we 've done a little time ago .
They 're more than 580,000 letters of genetic code .
It 's the largest molecule of a defined structure ever created by man .
It 's got a molecular weight to 300 million .
If we passit it with a 10 without spaces , we would like to 142 pes only to transcscscream this genetic code .
Now , how do we do it work ? How can we do it ?
Of course , you 're through a virus is a game from kids .
It 's a little more complicated when you use bacteria .
It 's easier when it comes from eucariote cells like our : you can just extract the nucleus and put another one , which is basically the process of cloning .
In the bacteria , the chromosome , it 's instead of integrated in the cells , but we recently demonstrated that we 're able to do a complete tradition of a cell . And then to get it .
We clean a chromosome from a microbial crossing from a microbial .
The two are different as men from mice .
We 've added some gene more so that we can decide what to do for this chromosome .
And then I 'm skied with enzymes that kill all the proteins .
And when we put it in the cells was study -- and you 'll appreciate our sophisticatoo-- the new chromosome -- the new chromosome -- the new chromosome .
And we started thinking that we couldn 't go beyond , but we tried to get more there .
This is one of the biggest mechanisms of evolution .
We discovered that a lot of species have added species to a second or a third crumosome somewhere , adding in a second thousand tracts to that species .
So who think about evolution as a gene , as a gene , it didn 't understand a lot of biology .
They 're actually called restring enzyme called restring enzymes that they actually get DNA .
The chromosome that was in the cells , you can 't have one .
The cell phones that we have inserit-like that we put it up .
It 's expressed , and he recognized the other as extent material , and he 's got a cell , and we 've been found it with only the cell cells and the new chromosome .
It became blue because of the genes we put it .
And in a short leverage of time , all the features of a species , went perse , and it turned all into a new species , based on new species , based on new software that we put in the cells .
All the proteins have changed , the membranes have changed , and when we read the genetic code of what we 've transferred to .
Now , this might seem to be genetic altering , but altering the DNA software , we can change things in a substantial way .
Now , I 've been explained that that we don 't talk about genesis -- but to progress from three million years and a half years of evolution , and I said that maybe we 're going to create a new version of Cambrian explosion where they will create new species on this digital process .
Why do that ?
I think it 's obvious when we think about our needs .
We 're going to go from six and a half billion people in the next 40 years .
Just give an example : I was born in 1946 .
There are three people on the planet for each of a existent in 1946 , there will be four .
We 're having problems now to find food , fresh water and clean , medicine and nzine for six and a half billion people .
It will be even more harder to do it for nine billion .
We use more than five billion carbon carbon , more than 30 billion baris , more than 30 billion bars .
That means a hundred million barrel a day .
When we try to find biological processes , or any kind of process to replace them , it 's going to be a huge challenge .
We have to keep the whole emission of all the emission of CO2 , from these materials that ends in the atmosphere .
At day , we have a day , because of scientific discoveries all over the world , we have a database with about 20 million genes , and I like to think that they are the components designed for the future .
The electronics is only one dozen about components , and think about how many different things came out .
Our limits here are data in the reality and our imagination .
We now have some techniques , thank you very quickly synthesization , able to create what we call combinatory genomics .
We can build a million chromosomes that can produce a million chromosomes a day .
Think of these 20 million genes , or different genes , or optimize the processes to produce eight or drugs , new vaccines , we can change , thank you very small team , and create more biology , now that 's about a small team , and create more biology .
And it 's just a standard selection .
We can choose to survival , chemical production or fuel , or fuel , or fuel ,
This is an instanteny-software software programmed that we 're working on to be able to sit to be able to sit in and design species to the computer .
Well , we don 't necessarily know how it will be .
We know exactly how their genetic code .
We 're now focused on the fourth generation of the time .
You also see you that extract hetangle was a grant experiment , it was a finished finished experiment .
We have carbons of second and third generation that will be used to be sugar with sugar carbons than the eighttarian or different kinds of butanol .
But the only way that biology can have a great impact without increasing the cost of the food and limitations the cost of food and limitations the cost of the CO2 in matter before , so we 're working on design cells that can achieve that . And we think we think about the first carbons of the most of the time generation in about 18 months .
The solar light combined with CO2 is a metodo-- but in our discoveries all over the world , we have found different metods .
This is a organism that we 've described in 1996 .
It lives in the deep ocean , about 2,000 feet of the deep of the water temperature of ebollition .
They create a molecular hydrogen hydrogen molecular as a source of energy .
We 're trying to figure out if we can sing CO2 , which can easily be transported through the CO2 in the carbons , to drive that CO2 in carbons , to drive this process .
So , in a short path we can be able to increase what the basic question of " which is , " We , greatest -- we have the modress of replace the whole oil industry .
Exactly . If you can 't do it from TED , where can you ?
It would become a main of energy .
And also , we 're working for using the same metods to create instantaneous vaccines .
You 've seen this year with the flu , we 're always going back to a year and a dollar when it 's about the right vaccine .
I think that this can change by building vaccines combinable vaccines .
And that 's how the future could start seemed to change , now , the tree of evolution , accelerating evolution with synthetic bacterial cells , I would be , and finally infine cells .
We 're so from the improving people .
Our purpose is to do it in a way to live long enough to try to do it . Thank you very much .
First of all I 'm going to show , the fastest possible , some fundamental job , the new technology that we 've taken Microsoft in followed a buy year ago . This is Seadron .
It 's a environment where you can interact to be local level that you can interact with a huge amount of visual data .
And we 're seeing a lot of gabyte digital photograph with a kind of zoom , and continuous , for a panoramic veloe , and we have the images like we want to .
And it doesn 't matter how big the amount of information that we see , how big these things are great , or the images .
Most of them are common photographs , but this is a scansion from the Congress of the Library of Congress , and it 's going to be in the gamel of 300 megapile .
It 's not a difference because the only thing that limits the prestations of a system like this is the number of pixel on your screen in any time . It 's also a very flexible architecture .
This is a book , like , example of data not images .
This is the Casa desolate Dickens . Every colonna represents a chapter .
So to show you that it 's just like this , and not images , we can do something like that , to actually show that it 's a real representation of the texture , not a picture .
It could be a way a little artificial way to read an electronic book .
I don 't have to you .
This is a more realistic example . It 's a number of The Guardian .
Every image is the beginning of a section .
And it really gives you the please and the nice experience of reading the real cartaceous version of a magazine or a newspaper , which is for nature .
We also did something with the corner of the angle of the Ladian .
We created a higher resolution -- much higher resolutionary than you 're using a normal advertising -- and we have extra content .
If you want to see the features of this automobile , you can see it here .
Or other models , or even the specific techniques .
And this really shows some of these ideas to eliminate the limits of space on the screen .
We hope that that that means to put in a pop-up and other porcheries , and other porcheries , you don 't have to be .
Of course , the map is one of the most obvious applications for this kind of technology .
And I don 't want to lose time , if we don 't say we have contribute to give them in this field .
These are all the streets in the United States , on the subtate in the United NASA .
So now we go to something else .
This is now a vivivivivivision on the web ; you can go to see it .
It 's a project called Photosynthy , which combines two different technologies .
One is Seadragon and the other is a very interesting research that was in Noah Snavely , a student of the University of Washington , with Steve Seitz 's aid in UW Szz 's UW Szz and Rick Szeliski . An n a great coaboration .
And it 's from the Web , managon Seadragon .
You can see it when we do this kind of screen , where we can go from an image to another and have this kind of experience , and have this kind of experience .
But the space collocation of images here has actually a significant .
The visualization algorithms of computers have been recorded these images , so that they have been taken together , so that they have to reareas of them -- all of the nearby the Rockpic Rockpic . And here you see of a de-show , or imaging , and these things are all been linked .
I don 't know if I have time to show you some other environment .
There are some more space-lot of them .
I want to go directly to one of the original data from Noah-- and this is from a previous prototype of Photosynthesis that we 've done for the first time last summer , to show you what I think is really the key to show you what I think is really the key key to show you what I think is really the environments we have been the environmentally observant that we have put in the web .
We had to worry about legal aspects and so on .
This is a re-building of Notre Dame images in Notre Dame images in Flickr . Basta digites , Flickr and you get images of types , other than the campublics and so on . Oach campaic . And one of these orange arange areas a picture that is discovered to this model .
So they 're all images in Flickr and they were all linked to spacecraft in this way .
And it 's possible to navigate this very simple way .
You know , I would never have thought of end to work for Microsoft .
It 's very gratificant to get this kind of accovering here .
I think you can see that it 's a lot of different kinds of photocameras : from the ones of the SLR , a meaning , meaning , put together in this environment .
And if I can , I try to find those strange .
And a lot of people have been stuck , etc .
There 's a series of photographs -- there 's a series of photographs -- it 's it .
This is a Notadow Dame poster Dame recorded .
We can go from poster to the poster to physics of this environment .
The essential point is that we can do things with social environment . This is now taking data from protecties -- from the whole memory of how it looks like the land , from the visual point of how it looks like the Earth 's point -- and connected those data together .
All those pictures become connected together , more of the parts of the parts .
You have a model of land that emerging .
Think about this as a prolungation of Stephen Lawler on Earth 's virtual .
It 's something that grows in complexity as as people are using it , and the people who are using it , and the advantages to use .
Their pictures are husbed with inseries on other people .
If you get to someone 's idea to contrassigning all these sorts of things , my name , my catteh is a picture of Notre Do suddenly enriching up with all those data , and I can use it as a point of entertainment in that space , in that metapuniverse , using a shin-screen experience of wherever , and have a cross-to-out experience of a red ,
Of course , a consequence of all that are virtual models of all interesting on the land , but from the interesting part of the land , and that 's not just seen achieving and satellite images and satellite images and similar images , but from the collective memory .
Thank you .
Chris Anderson : I understand ? What your software is that your software is that your software to us to do is that at some point , in the next few years , all of the photographs are going to be practical together ?
BAA : Yeah . What 's doing is basically to find out .
It 's creating hyperlinks , if you want to be in images .
And it 's doing it in the content of images .
The thing becomes very interesting if you think about wealth of semantive information that many of these images that many of these images .
As you have a research on the web , you get a phrase and the textextext on the web page has a lot of information about images .
Now , what if that picture is going to be connected all your pictures ?
So the amount of semantic interconnection and the amount of receptic interconnection and the amount of of semantic network .
CA : Blaise , it 's really amazing . Compliments .
BAA : Thank you very much .
One of the main pleasure , when you travel and one of the thanks of the ethnographics is the way to live between who has no long-dimented traditions , among the past in the wind , the wind , you touch it out of the plants .
I think of sciamans Jaguar Jaguar traveling again . I 'm even even even more than the Lattea , or that the monitor of the Himalayas , the buddies are still significant of the Dharmful , to remember the most importance of the Dharm , but that the importance of anthropology , and that the idea that the world in which we live in sense , in which we live in sense ,
the consequence of a particular adaptive set of choices that our remains has done , well , or not evil , many generations do .
And , of course , we all share of the essential traits .
We all proof .
We are subjects to start .
We have to deal with inexorability of death , so we don 't surprise if we 're setting --
We all have an art .
What it does is the particular particular of the song , the rhythm of dance .
It doesn 't matter that are the Penan forests of the Borneo , or the following of the Vodoo 's Saharbor 's warriers of Kenya , or the Curandero of the Ande , or a campairies in the heart of the Shara .
He was my journey in desert a month ago , or a yak in the yak of Qomolangma , on the Everest , the world 's mother 's dead .
All of these people teach us that there are other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , other ways of moving in the world .
And if you reflect a minute , it 's a concept that can give you hope .
And together , together , with the myries of the world , the world 's cultures create a spiritual life and cultural that is important for the well-being of the planet as a biospheras of a biological ragnote as biosphere .
And you can think of this re-cultural ragnonote , and you can call the thnosphere , and you can call the total sum of all concepts , dreams , ideas , inspirations , ideas , inspirations , inspiration , intuitions ,
The etnosphere is the fantastic patrial patriage of humanity .
It 's the symbols of what we are and what we can be in how inquisitive species .
And because it was a biosphere was a very much as it was as as it happened to the thnosphere and unfortunately .
Nobody biological , for example , would say that 50 percent of all species was or is on the orders just in the orders just because it 's fake , or -- in the most apocalyptic -- in the field of biological diversity -- and you don 't even have a little bit of the most optimistic , that of cultural diversity .
The index of that is , of course , the language loss .
When you 're born 6,000 languages on this planet .
A language is not just a vocabularian or a series of rules , or a series of rules .
A language is the human spirit of the human spirit .
It 's the middle of which the animal of every culture is in the material world .
Every language is a forest of mind , a bacin mind , a bacin mind , a spiritual possibility .
And of those 6,000 languages , as we are here in Monterey , at least half of the half of them is not sustained in the ears of children .
They don 't come to teach children , which means , unless you don 't share something , which are already dying .
What is there more sad than being done by silence , the being the silence of being , the last to talk a language , the not have a way to transit the wisdom of you ,
This behind is that stand in some of the world every two weeks , every two weeks , a send , and he brings with her in the last syllables and door with tombos in a language .
And I know someone who will say , " Is it not that ?
Wouldn 't it be a better place if we 're talking about the same language ? " Benissim , then we talk to yoruba . We talk the cantonese .
We talk about kogue .
You 'll be a sudden , what it means is not to talk about their language .
I 'd like to make a journey through the thnosphere --
a little journey to give you a little journey of what we 're losing .
Most of us forget that when I say , " different ways of existing , " I mean , really different ways of existing .
We take for example this bimbo Barasana , in Amazon Amazon , the people of anacond anacond , who believed the myth to come from the river of the waste slats .
It 's a people who are not able to distinguish the blue color from the green because the time you 're identified in the forest , which depends the population depends .
They have a strange language and a matrimonial rule , called " examia language , " you have to marry a person that 's a different language .
All of that radical radical , in the past mythologic , yet the particular particular particular one is that in these families that you 're or seven languages because of marriages mons are about or seven languages of marriage .
They 're just listening to and then start talking .
We take one of the most interesting tribes I lived , the Waorans of Ecuador north , a popular people who had the first contacts in 1958 .
In 1957 , five missionaries have been trying to make a mistake .
They did come down the top photographs that they thought they were going to have them in a packaging that this people 's population ,
They collected the land , they 've been shown them on the research of a shape or a shape , or a shape , and , not finding nothing , they 'd concluded that they were killed the five missionaries with the lance .
But Waorans don 't kill the foreign .
They were killed with them .
54 percent of the mortality was caused by themselves .
We have been on eight generations and we found two cases of natural death and when we insisted , they had a lot of them , they had a very aged that he had had been aged so that he died it , and then they killed it killed him him .
The hunters were able to recognize the 40 animal urine steps and recognize the species .
In the early ' 80s , I 've been assigned a very interesting task when my Harvard Harvard , he asked me if I wanted to go to Haiti to sweat the base of Duvalier and Tonton Macoutes , and Tonton Macoutes , and I mipossessing about the vealing of the velenables that used to do the zombies .
To give a sense of miracolost , I should have to understand Vodoun culture . And that Vodoo is not magic .
It 's a kind of a complex , metaphysical vision of the world .
Very interesting .
If I asked you to tell the great religions of the world , what would you say ?
Christianism , Islam , Buddismo , Ebraism , Ebraism , etc .
A continent is always left out , thinking that sub-Saharan Africa doesn 't have any religious . And they do and the Vodoo is not the other than the distilside of these religious concepts in the tragic concepts during the tragic concepts of slavery .
What makes the voodoo is the intended up between life and death .
So , the alive of the spirits .
The spirits can be invoced by the Great Acqua , they respond to the dance of the dance of the dance of the vision in the soul of the vision in a way that 's active .
So , the voodooists love to say , " You white go to church to talk about God .
We give them in the temple and we diventer God . "
And from the moment you 're possessed , is the spirit that you , how bad you can make you ?
So you have to these incredible events : follow voodoo in state of trance that touch impunties that touch out of a demonstration of the power of mind when it 's the power of mind when it 's catalyzed in a state of exciting extreme .
In all the people I 've lived the most extraordinary of the Sierra Nevada in the Sierra Nevada Santa Marta , in the Santa Marta , in the Santa Marta .
Desesign civilization , which was a time they lived on the charaibia , which was ring on the charaibia , the people would be ritional on massive mails , which was rushed on the vulcycle .
In a major , this people have never been conquisted , this people has never been conquisted by the Spanish .
But they are governed by a clergy , but their formation is so extraordinarily extraordinarily .
The young people followed it from the families to three or four , and they live in a world of darkness and shadows in a world that 's made of dark and shadows in a world of ice for 18 years .
Two nine years of choices for reproduce the nine years of management that spend in the user of the mother , they are now metaphorically in the ushes of the Great Mother .
And for that time , they 're acculturated to the values of their society , values that predict their preyes and only their prayer balance -- or to say the balance -- or to say the balance of ecological balance --
At the end of this incredible initiation , they 're suddenly took out and for the first time in their life , at 18 years , they see an alone . And in that consciousness of the first butter , when the sun is values of the beautiful landscape , all that they 've learned in theory . The prey is it 's all of his splecraft . And the predict is , all of his splanded behind .
" With ? Right how I told you .
It 's amazing to you . " It 's now to you protect it . "
They call them more brothers and say that we , the minor brothers , we are the destruction of the world .
This is extremely important .
When we think about India 's Ingene populations and the environment of Rousseau and the old history of wild , which is a razer , which is a razeau , and maybe we say that these people are closer to the Earth of us .
The Ingenes are not feeling or feeling .
There 's no space for these things in the Asmat Asmat the Onnail , or the winds of Tibet , but thank thank you to the end , they created a mystical point of the Earth based on the concept of what the Earth can live because it 's infected with the concept that the Earth is only live because it 's infected by human consciousness .
What does that mean ?
It means a boy of Ande who grows up to be a boy of Ande who 's a windating of Apu that 's going to be human being deeply different , and it will have a human being different human being a different human being a different way with the mountain , that place to a mountain of the Montana who is growing up to be scavated .
That 's a mineral one is a mineral or a mineral heral is irrelevant .
What 's interesting is the metaphor that defines the relationship between individual and the natural world .
I grew up in the Britannica Britannica , credying that the forests were cutting to be cutting .
And that 's a human being different from my friends Kwautter that believe the forests are the forests of Hamkukuk and the bine of paradise and the ball of the paradise and the bal spirits that live in the world , spirits that are dealing with the Hamatsa .
If you start to consider that these cultures can create different realities , you can start to understand some their sense of feelial discoveries . We take this plants .
I 've taken this shown to open up in the nordocccccies .
Mayahuash , some of you heard of the ayahuash , the most powerful psychoactive subtance .
What makes it fascinating the ayahuash is not the farmacological potential of substance , but his elaboration . It 's moved from two elaboration .
On one side , this lapart that has a series of beta-carboline , harmful and harmful , harmful , harmful hallucinogenic .
And by making the only plants , you have a blure that altery a little bit of consciousness , but it 's measured with a blues of a coffee family said Psychotria 's family 's family ,
This plant has powerful tripptamine , very similar to serotonin , dimethoxylptamine-5 , methoxylptamine .
If you ever see the Yanomami you 'll see the Yanomami , the substance that they do from a different species , he 's a different methoxylptamine .
Tiring that powder is a little bit like being disappeared by a card of paper dipinbars and land on a sea of electricity . Risate not a distorage of the reality ; it creates the dissoluption of reality ; it creates the dissolution of reality .
I was often with my professor , Richard Evan Shultes , the man who has been sent the psychical , with his discovery of the hike jump in the ' 30s .
And I think my way my point is not going to sifly these triptamines as an hallucinogenic because if you 're not stand anybody can tell anybody of being hallucinated . And then they can 't be killed because I 'm denied by a enzyme that is , we know , a enabyme that 's natural , who is , we horrise .
It 's possible to be a depending on the orally only if they 're killed by other chemicals that you know , of the MAO .
Now , it 's the beautiful : beta-carboline that are in this lianea version of MAO , the same kind of needs to potentions . The smies are income . The question is surprising : in a flech of 80,000 species of plants , like these people find two morogically not like these people who are two morogically not similar , but if you combine it 's sound to the sudden of the parts ?
We use the great euphermism of the proof and error , which can reveal it 's unfrupherd .
But if you ask the Indians , they 'll tell us , " The plants will tell us . "
What does that mean ?
This tribes , Cofan , has 17 variety of ayahuass , who are narely in the forest , and that our eyes would come into the species .
If you ask them , how they stbilize their tassonomonomy , they will say , " I thought , " I said , " No . "
The solution is : take 17 variety of variety in a wheat night and each one will canterial with a different .
And that 's not graduate to Harvard , but it 's much more interesting to count the stamp .
Now , [ applausi , the problem is that even the ones of us who have to heart people who have their own world , and they 're stypenter , but somehow reducts to the margins of history of our real world , and pass .
In fact , 300 years , it 's not going to remembered for his wars or the technologies , but rather as the the one was where we stopped and actively loved actively or a passively , the destruction of mass biological diversity and cultural diversity of the planet . Now the problem is not change .
All of cultures through centuries have been involved in a dance for new possibilities of life .
And the problem is not technology .
The Indians Sioux have not stopped to be Sioux when they put up and they reached as they have no stopped to be American when they put in in the horse and howl .
It 's not the change or technology that threatening the integrity of the wild . It 's the power . It 's the power .
The last last domination .
And if you give a look at the world , you 'll find that these are not destined cultures that these are not destined to disappear .
They are living creatures and dynamics outside from exististence existence of identificable , that they go beyonic their ability to adaptation .
I know that 's not a painting in the patries of Penan --
a people who have a Sarawak , in the Sarawak , in the South Asian , a people who lived in free to a generation ago , and now reduced to a generation , and now reduced to the reduction of the rivers , where you can see the inquinquinese slum that seems to be a way . Borneo Meridional Meridional Meridional Meridional , where you know , the gives you ,
With the subtractive wooods with the subtract on the forest .
Or , in the case of the Yanomami , are the diseases that came with the discovery of the gold .
If we move on on the mountains of Tibet , where I 'm doing a lot of research , you 'll see the hard of political domination .
As you know the genocide , the physical extinction of a people , is conviction on the audience , but the etnocide , the destruction of life , not only is not conconconvicted , but it 's even celebrated in certain certain environments , because it 's a part of developing of the strategy of development .
And you can 't understand the suffering of Tibet until you go from the beginning .
I have been through 6,000 miles from Chengdu in Westerdu , through Tibet , and I 'm coming to Lhasa with a young colleague , but only came to Lhasa young colleague , but only came to Lhasa that I love to hear .
6,000 worldoubts in dust and cenables .
1.2 million people killed by the military during the Cultural Revolution .
The father of this guy was ascriticized in the Panchen Lama .
That means that it was killed in the time of Chinese invasion .
His sweater , I was workers in Santity , in Santity , in Nepal .
Sua mother was impried and his colpe was to be rich .
It was brought to the age of two years from hidden in the age of two years of his gonna because she wouldn 't have to live without him .
The sister , who did the same , was put in reducing field .
And one day , he had inavailed a day , a day , a day , a mostly coffigant , was put on the jobs for seven years .
The Tibet 's pain 's pain , but recently the spirit of the people 's people 's people to have a present .
And then you reduce a choice .
We want to live in the monothy world of monothonia or we want to be to see the world policy ?
The great anthropologist , before we die from being told that his biggest fear was that , in our way to this vision , we 'll be able to this vision of the world , not only we 'll see the whole range of human imagination reduced to a construct modate of thought , but a day we 're going to see from a sleeping day .
And it 's a million of remembering that our species is existed for 60,000 years .
The Neolitica Revolution , who has to give us the agriculture of the seed of the seeds , which has made us subject of the skip with the prosse of the clerping , and by 10,000 years ago .
The modern world has been in the world has 300 years old .
That shareway story is not suggests that we have the answers to all the challenges that we 're going to have to deal in the millennia to come .
When they were to these things about the world , we 're asked what it means is , they respond to be humans , they respond to 10,000 different voices .
And it 's in these answers that we all have the chance of being what we are : a kind of achieve that all people and all the gardens can fire . And there 's great moments of optimism .
I 've been shown this picture on the northern extremely of Baffin the island of Baffin the island of whales , and this man , Olaya , Olaya , and this man , Olayas , he told me the wonderful story of his grandfather .
The canadese government was not always gentle with the Inuit 's people who are in the ' 50s to stabilize our supremise , we have to block them in colonies .
The grandfather of this man refused to go .
The family , I teeth her life , took him off all of the board , and all of his attitudes .
You have to know that Inuit don 't temat the cold , they use it .
The patins in origin were made of fish were made of a lot of loads .
The grandfather of this man didn 't make it up from the tarctic reaching .
It 's sleeped off , it 's calculated the pints in focal skin and defecated in their hand . When I did I put them in their hand . And when I made them up a mobile .
It 's spruzed on the points of this hit on the sheet , and when it became solid , he killed a dog .
It 's been taken a bunch , and created a bribe , with the horric cass , he imbrillied another dog and it 's disappeared on the banking , hit in the shake , hit in it 's hit .
We want to talk about cavarself-?
In the aprile 1999 , the canadese government has redate to the total control of an area of the biggest California and Texas put together .
It 's their new patria . It 's called Nunut .
It 's an independent territory . They 're contritched all the mineraries .
One of the examples of how a natione-state can reconcilient with his people .
And , finally , I think it 's quite obvious to who we have been in these remote areas of us was in these remote aren 't remote remote .
For someone is home .
They represent severtions of human imagination that go back to the dawn of time . And for all of these children , like the dreams of these children , become part of the swim of hope .
finally , we have National Geographic , we are convinced that politicians will never get nothing .
We believe the polemials --
[ Applasive ] are not persuasive , but we believe that stories can change the world , and maybe we 're the best institution to tell the stories of the world . EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEvery month of it .
156 countries transmit our television canal canal canal canal .
Our reviews of millions of people .
Our work is traveling in ethnosphere to bring our audience of wonderful cultural places that are going to have been able to have to have to have to have seen as and , hopefully , abbraced the central revealing of the central anthropology , and we have to find one of life in the diversity , and we have to find one of life in a pluralist and multicultural , multicultural .
where the wisdom of all people can contribututing to our collective well-being .
Thank you .
I 'm going to talk about some things that I wrote in this book that I hope you 've heard of and I 'll try to evidence some connections , in case not notice them .
I 'd like to start with what I call the dogma official dogma official .
The official dogma " What ?
The official dogma official dogma , the Western official dogma , " If we want to massisional wells . " " The way to do it is massive , " The way to do it is massive , " The way to do it is seximize the individual freedom . "
The reason is , on the side , in fact that freedom is in itself a value , is useful , is useful , is a useful , essential for human beings .
Onther is that if we are free , each of us can act to do everything that massive to do to do everything that massive , not nobody that we 're going to name our well-being , without nobody that we decided .
The way to massive freedom is massisimilar to massional .
The more choices are , the more they are free , and more is their freedom , the more they are their well-being .
So , I think , is so deeply royed in society that nobody would dreams it into the society that nobody would dreams it into the society .
And it 's also rooted in our lives .
I 'm going to show you some examples of what the progress has made possible .
This is my supermarket . It 's not particularly big .
I lose a simple note on condments .
In my supermarket is 175 conditions , without contact 10 of the extrad olive of olive olive , and the 12 aceti wheel that you can buy a number of conditions in the fire circumstance that nobody of one of the 175 pronings of your degrees .
That 's how the supermarket .
And then go to the electronics store to buy a stereo : casse , CD , radio , radio , piaright , the amplificator .
And in this single store of electronic , there 's a big number of components .
We can make six and a half million different combinations using the components that there are only one store .
You have to admit that there is a lot of choice .
Other fields : the world of communications .
Once , when I was a child , you could get all the wide telephones that were fornity services , to the pat that were fornites from mama Bell .
It was a telephone , you didn 't buy it .
One of the consequence of that , between the other was that the telephone never break .
These days are time .
We now have a nearareas of telephones , especially between the cellphones .
Here 's the mobile phones of the future .
My favorite is in the middle , MP3 , cutter , cutter , and forces for the brulnail .
If you don 't have yet seen it in the store under home , you 're well certain it will be it 's going to get .
And what happens is that people come in in the stopping and they do that question . And you know what the answer is , " No . "
It 's not a cell phone that doesn 't do too much .
So , in other life that are much more important than the aquists , you know , the same thing is explosion of choices .
And a lot of health stunning : no longer in the United States that you go to the doctor and the doctor 's telling you what to do .
Instead , go to the doctor , and the doctor teller you , " OK , we could do A B , or the " A. " A has these benefits and the answers . " What you want to do ? "
You say , " Doc , what should I do ? "
And the doctor says , " You have these benefits and the risks , and you have these benefits and the risks . "
" What do you want to do ? "
And you say , " Dotore if she was me , what would you do ? "
And the doctor , " But I 'm not her . "
We call it " mality autonomous , " expression that makes it seem like it makes it look like a nice thing .
But it 's not a moving the weight and responsibility to make decisions from someone who knows something , which is the doctor , to someone else that doesn 't know -- and almost certainly , and so much in the condition to make decisions from the patient .
There 's a huge marketing of drurug products , direct to people like me and you , that if you think you can 't buy them .
But if we can 't buy them , because there 's public they 're going to be ?
The answer is that they want to be domorning called the doctor for them to be able to change the recipe .
Something that 's so important as our identity is our horever is a question of choice , as you see in this jgnet , " We 're not going to force the children . " We 're going to be an identity : we need to invent .
And we can reinvent how many times we get it .
That means that every morning , to the risk , you have to decide that kind of person you want to be .
I 've been to family and marriage , a time the common perspective , and almost almost for anybody , was that you marriage the most pron possible , and you start to get the most earliest possible , and you start to get the most earliest possible .
The only real choice was with who , not when , and you don 't even when , and even what to do after .
And we 're going to play .
I teach students , and I do 20 percent of them , and they do 20 percent in less than a time .
And it 's not because they are brilliant , not because they are less diligent .
but why they are impensiered , I mean , I 'm going to married or not ? Would I have to do it now ? "
" Would I have to married me later ? " I have to think before children or career ? "
They are interrogatives .
And they try to answer these questions , even if this implies not to complete the homework that I ass and not getting a nice vote to my examples .
And they really have to do it . I 'm important questions .
Now , the work : we are lucky , like Carl underolineated , because the technology allows us to work every minute , every day , from every day , on the planet , except that from the Hotel Randolph .
I 'm talking about , there 's a corner , and I won 't tell anybody what the WiFi works .
I don 't tell you , because I want to use it .
What does this amazing is that we have about work ? It 's about work ? It 's that we have to decide , continuously , if we have to work or not .
We can go to see our son plays , with the mobile phone in a pocket , the Blackberry in the other , and the notebook , typically , on the goknees .
And even if they 're all spent , every minute that we see our son is also asking the game , we 're also asking , " Do I have to answer this called ? "
" Did I have to answer this letter ? I have to get this letter ? "
And even when the answer is " not , all of this makes the experience of your son 's game of your son 's game of your son 's game .
So , anywhere we look at , small things and large , and big , materials , materials and lifestyles , life is a question of choices .
Once the world was this : Ovice , there was some possibilities , but it was not a question of choice .
The world is today looks like this : The dilemma is , " Is it a positive thing , or negative ? "
The answer is Same answer is Same .
We all know , the positive latest latest ones .
All of this choice to comp. two of the people .
The first , is that it 's a paradoxually that 's a paralysis that produced paralysis .
With a lot of options between which choices , it becomes very hard to do it .
I give you an example : a conduct example : a conducted study on planes .
A connects of my colleagues had access to the Onnce , the giant society of depension , with about a million customers in 2000 different companies .
What she has discovered is that for every 10 solutions that are offert in more , the percentage of two percent .
With 50 offerts , there 's 10 percent in less than adhesions than they are only five . Why ?
Because with 50 fources of choice , is maluseful , is maledtely hard to decide , and choice is sent to be sent to the tomormormorrow .
And to wonder , and I still wonder , tomorrow , tomorrow , and of course , we 're going to be wondering ,
You know , it 's not just that these work from old people will eat food for dogs , because they will not have enough money , they will say that the decision is so hostical source of the dator of the job dators .
They 're not participating , they 're losing up to five thousands for years from the work dator , which would be well disposed to be .
So , the paralysis a consequence of having too much choices .
And I think it makes the world that 's like this .
" And finally , " Do the laster , " ketchup , senape or maion ? "
You 'd take the right decision , if it 's for ethernity , right ?
You don 't want to choose the wrong bottom , and you don 't want to choose to get the wrong condition .
So this is the first effect . The second is that we can avoid paralysis and make a choice , at the end , we 're fewer with less options of how we were with less options to be .
And that 's a lot of reasons .
One of these is that with a lot of conditions to choose , if you buy one , and it 's not perfect , it 's easy to imagine that you could have a different choice that you could have been better . And what happens is that the alternative imagined that you might have been better . And what happens is that the alternative imagined that , and the repeail the fendefense , and the revenues the date .
And when it was a very good decision .
The more choices you have , more easy displeasant than any detail that is insodatic is insodatic .
And also , there 's what economists call consto-opportunity .
Dan Gilbert has asked very well stamattine like the value that we give things things to things with .
The rest , when there are many options , it 's easy to represent alternative features of alternative , and being less sodatis-disfacts of the option that you have to be .
Here 's an example . I 've been schools with all those that are not New York .
But that 's what you probably think you 'd think .
There 's this couple to Hamptons .
A place of luxury .
It 's all about splendied . Otma day . It 's all for them .
It 's nothing . But what he thinks is , " Well , the buildings , it 's Agoam . "
" All my neighbors in Manhattan are off . "
" I could talk about legiing right in front of home . "
And it 's going to spend two weeks of the idea that 's losing -- every day -- the possibility of parking where he wants .
The expensive opportunity decrease in the satisfaction for what we have , even when the choice was excellent .
And more are the options that we have to consider , more the features that we have to be retired against how ex-opportunity .
Here 's another example .
This cartot tells us a lot of things .
It 's about living the moment , and maybe in the time , and maybe in the lives of living right .
But the most important point is that anything you choice , you 're not going to do .
The things that we don 't choose to be a lot of attractive that can make less attractive what we do .
And third point : spiral growing of expectations .
I tried it on my skin buying a new jeans .
I 'd like to almost always jeans .
Once the jeans were just like , you know , buy them and sleep from the beast , they were uncomfortable , just after having a life and work , a lot of times , they started going .
So I went to buy a couple of new when those old were gone , and I said , " I need to have a jeans , this is my cutting . "
And the committer said , " Lake slim , easy , relaxed , relationship axed ? "
Do you want them to have them or buttons ? " Stoneashed , " Radiased ? "
" Do you want to be layed ? "
" Do you want to walk up or cococool ? Bla blah blah , " Continuating it .
I was sbalored , and after a while I was able to say , " I want to say , " I want to say , " I want to know , " I want to all of males , and I 'm going to get out of the jeans , and I 'm out of the store , I would say , " I would have to do the best of the jeans that I 've ever had .
It was the massive .
But I felt worse .
Why ? I wrote a book for the whole book .
The reason I was worse is that with all that choice is that with all that choice , the jeans had to be perfect .
I was the beginning I had a minded . I didn 't expect anything about exceptional , when there was 100 different kinds of steps , but when I saw 100 different accidents , at least one guy had to be perfect .
What I had buy was good , but not perfect .
After I had paragoned that chosen with what I was trying to do was unsatisfied in comparison .
The added options in life , in people don 't do that increasing the expectations that these have respect to the excellence of options .
And that will produce less satisfaction , even when you get the results are good .
No one in the world of marketing if you realize .
Because if they knew it , you wouldn 't know what I 'm talking about .
The truth looks more like this .
" It was better when it was worse . " The reason that was better when it was worse was that when you were worse is that when it was worse was still possible to meet surprised .
Only , in the world we live in -- opulents , industrialized citizen , industrialized that we can hope is that things are things to the alil of expectations .
You never surprised as lifused because your expectations , my expectations , they are ingantic .
The secret of happiness -- what you 're here -- it 's , " Baxis , " Yes , " Yes , " Yes , " Yes , you want . "
I mean , a little car moment -- I really have married and my wife is really wonderful .
I couldn 't have done , I didn 't have any context .
But it 's not always a bad thing .
And finally , a consequence of buying a couple of jeans discoways when there 's just that jeans is that when you 're not satisfacts , and ask you , " Why ? "
Who is responsible ? " , the answer is clear .
The world is responsible . What can I do with it ?
When there are hundreds of kinds of jeans , and you buy one one of them , and you ask you who is responsible , it 's the responsible , is the clear , that you are the responsible ,
You could do better .
With hundreds of variety of varieties , there are no expertise .
So when people get decisions , even if the outcome is self-outcome , they feel satic , they feel insatic , they 're being insatic .
In the last few years , the depression is exploded in the industry .
I think a significant factor -- not the only one , but important -- of this wave of depression is that people have deludents are too high .
And when they have to explain this situation they think that the colame is they think they 're .
So the final result is that we 're in general , objectively , but we feel worse .
Let me remember you .
This is the official dogma , what we all take for good and it 's completely fake . It 's not true .
There 's no doubt that a little bit of choice is better than to have no deal with it , but it 's not a lot of choice is better than a little bit .
There 's a critical value , magic . I don 't know what it is .
But I 'm sure we 've been through a piece of kind of piece the level where the choices are improved .
Now , from political point of view -- I almost finished -- from political point , the peaceful is the follower .
What it allows us all this choice in the industrial society is the wealth of material .
There are many places in the world , and you know , you know , where the problem is not that they have too much choice .
The problem is they have too poor .
So the factor I 'm talking about is males of modern , rich is a bad of modern , rich society .
And what it makes you depress and climber is this : Steve Levitt Levitt talked about about how expensive and discoveries of money to baby are unuseful .
I mean these choices , complicated and avdious , it 's not that they 're just useful .
I 'm sure I 'm deleteries .
They 're going to get worse .
If a little bit of what in our society in our society , it allows a lot of choice , where people have too few possibilities , it would not only their life to improve but our own life .
That 's what economists call a paretian improvement .
A redistribution redistribution is all right -- not only to poor -- because of this choice in excess that we 're going to .
And then I 'll end up , " You can become all the way you want " --
You , people of culture , you 'll think , " But what does it believe that fish ? "
" It 's obvious that you can 't make anything in a wall . "
" A imagination castrated , a strategist of the world -- "
And I 'm going to have interpret it like this , at the beginning .
But then I think , instead , I realized that that that fish knows the long way .
Because the reality of the facts is that if you send it up , so that it 's not the freedom . You get the paralysis .
If you break the box in a way that all of decreases possible defection defecation .
You excited the paralysis , and you reduce the wells .
They all need a sphere .
This is almost certainly too strictly , maybe even for the fish , and certainly for us .
But the absence of a little symbolic symbolic sphere is a recipe for childhood .
Thank you very much .
