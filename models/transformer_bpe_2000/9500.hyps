The year I showed these degrees to show that the slives the glacial artics , which for almost three million years of the United States continental size of 48 percent of the United States continental continental .
So this subject the gravity of the problem because it doesn 't show it to the problem because it doesn 't show it spessor of the ice .
The calcalculate is , in a sense , the heart heart , the heart heart of the global climate system .
You can extate it and you get up .
The next next dededebing will be a carled carled on the last 25 years .
The gains are lost in red red .
You can see , you can see , you can see ,
That 's the ice in inverage , that you get up .
You can see that the cosidold , lost five years or more , is like five years or more , is like the sangue , which is like the body here .
In 25 years , it 's been been so ,
This is a problem because the interest is the terrial scale the terrial scale , where there are hundreds of carbon congeled that , they 're truly transformed in meters .
I 'm going to tottality of the atmoster of the atmoster remaining , that quantity could be , squantity , that quantity could be , and I don 't get around .
In some laghi , I 'm profound in Alaska meter 's already reboling on water .
The professoresse Katey Walter in the University of Alaska team took a team driving with a board .
Video : Wow ! Al Gore : You 're good . The question is if we 're also going to be .
A reason is that this extremely termal scale from the North .
This is a further regime to regime .
The taken never had never reached similar .
This is the Kangerlusaq , in the West , in the Groenland .
If you want to know how to do the mess of the mess of the sleeping glass on terraferma , here is where you reaching the mate .
These corrents are increasing rapidly .
Another part of the planet : Antartide , the largest block of the planet .
The month , the scientists have dikilost that the flower is in negative , and that the Antartttarttttarttttttartttttars , is particularly , it 's particularly in the spot .
It 's six meters of six meters of the across , like Groenland .
Sulla Himalaya , the largest block of ice , you see new lags , you see new laghes , which they were gacier .
The 40 percent of the world 's population will remember of the water .
Sulle Ande : this glacier is the bottom of this city .
The bring is increased .
But when you dimine , the same happens to the water .
In California , the neve is diminuged about 40 percent .
The grirections are in cribs .
The predictions , like you 've read , I 'm graves .
The growth in the world 's powerful growth of the incends .
The environmental environmental environmental return out of the normal and without precedent .
Four times , over the last 30 years , the respect 75 years .
This is a beautiful beyond .
If you look at the context if you can see the consequences .
In the last five years we 've added 70 million tons of CO2 hours , 25 million tons of tons in the oceans every day .
Look attentirely the Pacific area , from the American area , and both of the Gars , and both on the subcontinent , where there is a poor , where there is a poor in the oceans .
Most of global warming , together to the deforest , and it 's 20 percent , which is the 20 percent , is the further than the commostly .
The oil is a problem , and the carbon is even worse .
The United States are one of the two countries with the most emissions , together at China .
And I had to build a lot of other carbon owner .
But we 're going to a change of direction .
These are the projects in the last years and some projects in the last years and some provide of the versus .
And every way , there 's a political political tta in our country .
The carbon industries and oil have spending 250 million dollars in the last year for the carbon dioil , which is a obsimer .
The picture I remember in something --
I see Natal , in the Tennessee , where I live , there was a losed of 3.8 billion swalking .
Mayaybe you saw it on the news .
This is the most flow of scories in America .
It 's happened around Natale .
The publishy nature of a carbon industry was this .
Video : ♫ Frosty the carbon is a kind of allegro and happy .
It 's abondant here in America , and it makes our economy .
Frosty carbon is always more or .
It 's a good , adorable , and they work hands , and they 're dependent .
Al Gore : Da is free part of the West Virginia .
The larger society is Massey Coal , is Massey Coal . This is his love .
Video : Don Blankenship : I 'm going to -- Al Gore , Nancy Pelode , Harry Reid -- they don 't know what they 're talking about .
Al Gore : So the Alleance for the Clima of the Clima has launched two campaiged campaired .
This is one of it , one part .
Video : ALergy : ALergy see the climate change as a sery to our business .
So , our priority is investing a great quantity of money in a such of money in a public public health and conflict the truth .
In fact , the carbon is not sport .
We think it 's published -- it 's also a good defuel .
So , not preocupateves of climate change .
Let me do we do .
Video : Carbone , you 've heard about it .
So I 'm going to make a game in a structure to the pattern that is about what the carbon dioxion .
Straordinary ! The machines are a little rumorous technology , but this is the such of the technology of the carbon technology .
The carbon is between the main causes the main causes , but the night technology , but the notice of the carbon technology that you see changing everything .
You have a eye : this is the technology of the carbon dioxide .
Al Gore : I mean , the treatment is connetwork , and that 's the economic issue and that of the national security .
Video : Comvvast America is in cribed ; the economy , the security crisis .
The fallenge that the colleages all of our dependence from combustic comfortable , as the carbon , and the importantly .
Now , there 's a new , there 's a new , solution to use .
Repower America : 100 percent of energy , in the 10 years .
A plan to reput the America to work , it 's going to make sure , and help us to stop global warming .
Finally , a solution that basts to solve our problems .
Repower America . Scoprite .
Al Gore : This is the last .
Video : You think , it 's to reach energy to America .
One of the faster mostly , the dependence from the combustiable to the dependence on our planet .
It 's going to do : The future is here . It 's here , a new energy energy .
What 's two : Nuoves for a few people who are workers for brecogood .
Comment : Repower . It 's time to be realistic .
Al Gore : A old old proverbio , they say , " If you want to go faster , you go to faster ,
If you want to go back , you go to , and you go together . "
We have to go away , fastly .
Thank you very much .
The year TED fecame in TED fectroduction on the LHC .
And I promise to to get to to enage you on how the machine works .
So , I 'm going to those that . And I 'm not , there were no , the LHC is the largest experiment .
His compelling the conditions that were less than a billion on a billion on the beginning of the universe -- until over 600 million times .
All of this is just environment .
This is the Ginevra .
We 've been picture of these mini-Big mini-Bang mini-Bang mini-Bang mini-Big mini-Big mini-Big mini-Bang mini-Bang mini-Bang mini-Big mini-Bang mini-Big mini-Bang mini-Bi-g mini-Bang mini-Big mini-Bang mini-g mini-g mini-Bang mini-g mini-Bing mini-mini-g mini-g .
This is what I work . This is called ATLAS -- is 44 meters and has a floor of 22 feet .
This is a spectacular picture of ATLAS in building so you can see the proportion .
The 10 settember year we have acceso the machine for the first time .
And this picture was taken by ATLAS .
It 's immense to imming in the saving of control .
It 's a fasm picture of the first particles that had done all of the LHC , both , both in collision , and I spread a part of the HC , and spread in the LHC , and I spread the reator .
In other words , when we see that the picture 10 settember , we understand that the machine the machine .
I don 't know if it was this to make us more or or this , when somebody went on Google and vide that the page was this .
That means we have a cultural impact of the scientific impact .
It 's a week later , there was a problem with the car , and it was a problem with these dored files here -- these dored flower .
These figure out 13,000 prines when the machine works at the massive machine .
Now , the technical is to look at the fields and they will say , " It 's not true . "
And they can do it because when they 're very cold , they can be cosid-conflicts .
So , at least 271 degrees , at a temperature in the space between the stars , these falls can bring that corrent .
In one of the most of the most note of the most note magnetic in the LHC , there was a fect of fectication .
So the falls fle-scale , and 13,000 printed , and 13,000 practiced a electrical resisted .
This was the result .
Now , this is more impressive if you think these magnetals if you think these magnetes are more than 20 tons , and you have about 30 centimeters .
They 're dannear about 50 magnetic .
We had to take them , what we had it .
We have repristinated and it .
So , they 're coming out of their place .
The end of the marzo LHC will be new integry .
We 're going to get it , and we expect to get the right right right or slut , and we continue to find out what the morning to discovered what the universe are the universe .
Now , of course , in a way , these clean , these clean across the dibad value of the value of science and engineering . It 's to contempt .
I think the fact that the fact that it 's so hard , I think it 's the limits , I think that 's the value of things like LHC .
I want to conclude with the words of a scientist Inglens , Humprey Davy , which , you know , in the defends , and the experiments of his puls , his pulens , his pulens Faraday , " Nipiece is so much for the ideas of the human design , which is not definitive for the ideas , which are not very dangerous design , which is not very dought our ideas ,
Thank you .
I want to start to ask you to rethink when children , children , from children , play , play cools .
Which understand how to reach them and further , and they 're going to move them and move them , and they learn about thinking and they 're going to think and remaining relationship .
The reasoning is proaching is defoundly connected to the way we understand the world around us .
So , from the information from our own own own own own own own objects with objects , together at my physical conflict , and my collaborator , and my collaborator , I started asking me , " And if we 're a computer , I started asked a computer , instead of the mouse , as we can only have a physical popular , I could just stroying a physical stroying information with a physical way ,
and systemareas ?
The question was so interesting that we decided to explore the answer , I building the Siftable .
In a few words , a Siftable computer is a big computer as a bircocooker .
In a few words , a Siftable computer is a big computer as a bircocooker .
You can move to the hand , you can see the hand , you can see the right movement and have a screen and a screen and a radio radio .
But it 's sometimes , I 'm physical , like , you can move up .
Siften are the example of a new ecosystem system to ecosystem to make digital information .
And as hand they become more physical movement , and other , and the other people , and hand hand , as they become more physical movement , as we can move , and different tops and different tops and different tops of interaction .
So I 'm going to do a simple example .
This Sift-tail is conflict to show , if you in a direction , the video roters , the video raise , if you win the other side side .
These are interactive interactive are consciousness .
If you 're interested in what 's about what 's happening to their around .
If they are circircircircircircummmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmit .
If they are circircircircircircummmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmit .
They have to have their movement and inclination .
We then realize that one of the interest of the interaction was the power of the interaction was the power of the data , " to fall of the data , " an example of a liquid .
In this case , we have three Siften conflict as secks of vernice and I can use them to make them the color in the central , where they 're going to go .
And I can use them to stay the color in the central , where you put them .
If we are too , we can get a little place .
And I 'm also good possibilities of approvide , as language , and the math math and games where people can try to try things things things , and you see the things that fastly , and you see the result .
Now , I 'm now --
This is a Fibonacross Fibonacross a program of equations .
Here we have a words of words that 's half in Scarabeo and Boggle .
Pratically , at every remember , a letter in any case , you know , Pratically , Pratically , every turn out of a letter on every Siftable , and as you 're trying to buying words on a ditionary .
Then , after about 30 seconds , and you have a new new lectiny new lecting and new possibility to try .
Thank you .
Here 's what children came to Media Lab , I 've done in the Media Lab , I 've been done and I had a video video .
They 're very fle-very .
And one of the interesting things about this kind of application is that you don 't have to give you a lot of education .
You have to say , " What makes words , " and they will exactly what to do .
Here 's how other people who try to try it .
This is our head , right there 's our head , there .
In fact , he wanted to just impilts .
They 're just morning , for him .
Now , this is a whole application of a interactive application .
We wanted to build a tool for the pattern of the language of Lui is Felix .
It 's going to give new characters in the scene , solving Siften , and they were associated .
It 's going to give new characters in the scene , solving Siften , and they were associated .
So , it 's doing the sun .
Video : The sole is surprising .
David Merrill : Now , he took a tractor in the scene .
Video : The tractor .
I work ! Yeah ! Yeah ! Yeah ! Yeah ! Yeah ! Yeah ! Yeah ! Yeah ! Yeah ! Yeah ! Yeah ! Yeah .
So , I got the Siftable and put up with the characters can interact with characters --
Video : Bau !
I invent their story .
Video : Ciao !
DM : That 's a story with the end , and it can decide him how you fly .
DM : That 's a story with the end , and it can decide him how you fly .
Video : Voly : I 'm going to go .
DM : The last example I have time to show you is a tool , I recently recently , to walk and extent music .
It 's a tool , I recently recent , to figure and existing music .
Siften here are agism , basically , and the battery .
You have four different of these four different variations , and you can choose .
You can enjoyed these suons in a sequence to your pleasure .
And modifly , they just doing a slide , and a sequence . "
These are actually control from vive , like the reverbs and the filter and the filter .
The attacks to a particular supply and then including it .
And then there are the general actually , as time and fly , and you want to the intersequence .
We look like it works .
Video : DM : We 'll start a base in two Siftable in two Siftable , " systems , we can reward the other base .
Now , I put a line line .
Video : Now I add you . Now ,
Video : And now I 'm going to put the filter , so I can control the battery , so I can control the vive .
Video : DM : I can fast the intersequence the intersequence , by a landlater .
Video : And I 'm going to add the filter , and I 'm going to give more expression .
Video : DM : I can recombining the sequence " to the fly .
So I don 't have to plan , but I can improvate , it 's longer , or more cort .
And now , I can fashion the intersequence to sequence the ineating Siftable . "
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is to build new new must be new interface to make new must as well as our brain and corbody .
And today , I 've had time to show you one of the results of this lost lost , and some possibilities we try to bring out from the laboratory .
The concept that I want to spend is that it 's coming up to this new generation of objects for digital projects , that will bring information in our world in the way we want .
Thank you very much .
I don 't see the now of you .
I 'm a written .
I 'm going to realize is my profession , but it 's more than that , of course .
It 's also the love and the fascine of my life .
And I don 't expect me that I can change .
But , I said , something particular happened in my life and in my life and in my career , which has taken me to remember the interacting with this work .
The particular thing is that I have recently written this book called " Mangraft , this biogiger called " Manging , " which , diversed my precedent , for some reason , and it 's a big , sensatisitive , but I 'm a big sensitive , became a whole , sensatisatisical bookey .
And the result is that everywhere , people are going to me , people like that if I were condanced .
Davue -- I 'm sweather , condannated .
They 're going to me now all worried and said , " I don 't have to be able to be able to do better ?
Don 't you get to keep up to writing all life without power to be able to create a book that can be able to create a book that can important book ? "
What do you do someone ? "
It 's rassure , you know .
But it could go , at the part of what I remember 20 years ago , when I began to say , people -- I was a adolescent -- I wanted to be a scritical .
I went to met the same reaction of the same flower .
And people said , " I don 't told me to have successful ?
Don 't you know that the hubility of the killed ?
Don 't you know , to do this mestide for all life without the lives of the lif-driven , and death a heart of the both of the pining both of the fliving falliment ? "
So , you know .
The answer -- the answer to all these questions is : " Yes . "
You know , I have been putting all of those things .
I always had a purpose .
And I 've also a lot of other things that people could not indeed .
As the algain and other things .
But , how I think about what I thought I was asked to me , and I was going to me , why ?
Is it rational ?
It 's logical that everyone deaths to be spented by a work that you have been saying to do .
But what 's 's all of this particular impress to make us nervous health health health worth worth worth worth as well ?
How my father , for example , he was a chemist and not remember of a sun and not remember in the 40 years of activity in the land-activity activity of the engineer ?
Don 't have -- that blown to the John , how do it 's ?
Don 't work that , hitself ?
Onestly , engineers like chemimic group , they don 't have certainly , in secemiles , the reputation of being hand-hands .
You writers , we have enough enough , and not just writers , and not just writers , but creative reputation of all , we have this reputation of being huge mentally .
And it 's not another that you look at the trils of the death of the magnifies that , just in the 111th century , they 're dead and often .
And the ones that are not suicians have been disdisfact that they 're not going to be really dissitting from their dons .
Norman Mailer , before I die , in the last interview said , " Ogn my book book had killed me a little bit of the world-furn extraordinary fly .
But we don 't bad to say , because we 've heard these things so long as we 've been completely interized that some way we 've been completely interized and the notion that the creativity and the art of the art and that art , and that art , at the end , at the end , to be able to be able to angoes .
And the question I want to bring all of the today is : you 're according with this idea ?
It 's good that -- because I also look at a centimer of a centimer of distance to me not good for nothing .
I think it 's odist .
And I think it 's very dangerous and I don 't want to see the perpetuated century .
I think it 's better to encourage our big minds .
And I know that , in my case -- in my case -- it would be very dangerous to to what I 'm going to start to what I 'm going to feel about the sounds , I 'm in my career .
I 'm going to look at , I 'm pretty young , I 'm pretty young , I 've been about 40 years .
I still have about four decadecadees in me .
And it 's very likely , that any thing I 'm going to be right now in the world as the work of the world as the work that was going to be able to my last book .
I 'm going to ask , because we 're all more friends here -- is likely that my biggest happened is to my biggest .
Oh , Gesus , who thought .
You know that 's the kind of thinking that 's the kind of thinking that 's going to start to start to ball of the morning and I don 't want to do it .
I would keep keep to keep this work that we do .
So , the question is , how to be , how ?
And so it looks , after many reflecons , that the way to work to kekeep it is to kekeep a psychologist , right ?
I had some way to find a security of sure between me , and I 'm writting , and my natural anxior of what I 'm going to get to the way . And as I was trying to look at the time , and I was trying to look at the time , and I was looking at the time , trying to see if I could be able to see if they could be able to look at the time , and I 'm going to see if I could have the best ideas
And on how to help people believe in the inerent people to make the risks of creativity .
And that search has taken me to the old Great and anticked Rome .
I 'm going to get me because it was in circle and then back .
In the ancient Great and Rome -- people don 't seem to believe that creativity was creativity to come from men , OK ?
It was thinking about that creativity was this spirit is that that spirit and that 's holds from a few people are saying and shared , for reasons .
The creativity of creativity of creativity " demons of creativity " demons . "
Socror , wonderful , wonderful , created to have a demon that elart from landwood .
The Romans were the same idea , but they call that species of the body realized that kind of spirit .
The is great , because the Romani , because Romani didn 't really think that a genius was really good intelligent .
They have to have a genius was that a kind of defast that has been living in the murs of a study , a little bit like a piece of a artist , a little bit like the Dobby , and that 's going to be out of the work of the work of that .
It 's a funny -- that 's the distance of which is the distance of which is psychologist that protegical protegets of your work .
And all of the people who was so that it worked , right ?
So the articles were protect by certain things , like for example , as for example , not ?
If your work was exceptional work was not able to take all the way , all of the tiny , all of they had been helped by this genius .
If your work fallide , it was not all all the college , right ?
They all know that was your genius to be a incapable .
And so people han concept the creativity in Occident for a long time .
Then Rind came and all , and it all , and it 's going to be human human being in the center of the universe , and we 're all the people in the center and the mistery and without more space to the creatures that they write from divinity .
This was the major of humanesime and people started thinking that creativity was completely by the shared shared .
And for the first time in history , you start to referred this or that artist as a genius of a piece of person with a person .
And I have to say , I think it was a big herror .
I think of someone , a simple person to believe , a simple person to be like a recipient as the source , and the examples of all the misters , creative and the extremely inoscient and a responsibility is a responsibility to fragile to fragile ,
It 's how to ask someone to ingoes .
Deform and distores , and they 've got all these enginestible inestimate the performance .
And I think it was this pression to have distruted the articulated arts in the past of the articulated arts in the past of the arts .
And if this is true , and I think that 's the question , and now ?
We can do it fun ?
Maybe back to a more than human compassion of relationship between humans and creative .
Or maybe no .
Maybe we can 't cancer 500 years of rational in a talk of 18 minutes .
And there 's people between the audience that solved to the audience that would be laining scientific , insom that they do people , and you know , they 're going to do people , or the people are going to happen or their projects .
Probly not to convince you all about this thing .
But the question I would like to take is -- why no ?
Why don 't think that way ?
Because it has more sense of any other thing that has ever heard to explain the exasperts of the process of the process of creative process .
A process that , as anyone who ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever compored .
And , it can sometimes , it can seeming completely paranormal .
I did this met recently with the extraordinary poetesis , " which has 90s , but it was a few years , but it was a few years , but it was a little bit of life and said that during his infected in the Virginy , and he said , he was working on the wait , and I feel about the beyed by the landscape .
He said , I was like a fragorous fragorous .
And it was rotoling to her from the landscape .
It was to get , because he was tremendous under his lands on the land .
He had a sold to have a sold to do that point and it was , " corrate like a math . "
And then he was going to go home and come up to this poetched , and wouldn 't have to make a piece of card and a messing enough of card and a mathemath , as the traped and a page .
Sometimes I couldn 't be fastly , so correct and correct out of the roten and the roten roten to come in and the roten roced to go through and his hands and would keep up to the rotoling , how she said , " one other poet . "
Then there were those times -- this piece , I 'm going to dimentiched -- there were almost losing of moments that was almost losing , right ?
So , he was corring to home and sesea and and the poetches was going to the wasking up , and he was a wases in the wases , and then said , and then she said , and then she said , and then she was like you to the other hand and the pair .
He was the poetime from the coda and the reput in his body and reput on the page .
And in these cases , the poetches , it would be on the page and intention , but the last word at the last word .
So when I thought , I thought -- it 's so much , it 's exactly equal process .
Not all my process , I 'm not a condition .
I 'm a moving , and my way to work is ; it 's a way to work and I 'm going to go and I 'm going to work and I 'm going to go and I 'm going to get up .
But I personally , in my head , I have a meeting against that thing , at sometimes .
And I imagine that many of you have the han made .
You know , even if the work and ideas were dried by a certain deount of deep not not .
What is this thing ?
And how can we relationship to it , but , I 'm not going to do you , but , rather , I 'm doing it , that you can do it ?
So , how I look , the best example of the contemporary contemporary , which I have a Tom Waiting , which I interview of a day .
We were talking about this , and you know , Tom , for most of life has been the incarnation of the artist came back , trying to control , trying to control , and trying to control , and try to these species of these species of impults ,
But then I invited , you , and a day as he was driving on a driving on a autostraight to Los Angeles , changed everything .
It was going to go fasting and all of a tracking tracking this little framment of mer , which is going to be inspired , and you know , and you want , and you know , it 's wonderful , and you know , it 's wonderful , and the deserve , and the describing .
It doesn 't have a piece of card , not a mmer register .
So , I began to feel this species of old old old , and I 'm going to lose , " I 'm going to lose , and I 'm obsessional .
I 'm not good enough and I can 't do it . "
And instead of go in the panic ,
I 'll put the interest process and fall and further something completely new .
And I 'm going to just the top and said , " Scause , you don 't see that I 'm driving ? "
" To seems to write a song now ?
If you really want to be , there 's back in a more opports when I can take me clearly cut me .
You 're going to important to important anything else today .
You 're to disturbing Leonard Cohen . "
And his process , I work later .
I don 't work , the work was still as well as I always .
But the process , and the weight that was required when the wasn was required when the genius , the genius that was out of him , and the liberry to the other problems and remainly remainly remainly , and I realized that didn 't have to be a whole thing to be interorized and realized .
but I well-this peculiar , wonderful bizars a conversation between Tom and this thing and this thing and that I 'm going to be Tom and that I 'm not Tom .
So how to feel that story is to change a little bit of the way I was working on and I was already to me .
This idea , I writing when I was writing , " Manogy , Pregan , and I said , " and I add in one of those cave the disperation where we 're working on something and we 're working on something and we 're working on something that will be a book , which will be a book that will be a book , that will be a book .
Not just good , right , right the books .
And I started thinking about this project .
But then I remember to Tom that I talked about the air and try to us .
So , I 'm going to my face on the hands and and I recognized my common on on a swaves .
And I said , " Sents , " Sent , what we 're knowing that if this book is not going to be good bad , not be intercolcolly , not be intercolcolly college , not be interested in in my , no bad , " Sent , " Sent , " Sent , " Sents , " Sent , what 's not going to be interested in my book , "
Because as I see I 'm trying to see what I , I don 't have more than that .
So if you want you to be better , you have to present , and make your part .
OK . But if you don 't , you know , what , I don 't do about it .
I 'm going to writing this same because it 's my work .
And I 'd like to do for my part of my part of my part of my part of my part of my part -- " because -- at the end is so , OK , OK , OK , and it 's so , I 'm going to do it for the dances of the clear and musical sleeping and musical slethetic and musical musical to the hours .
And they were always magnifies , because the ballerini were very professionists and were fantastic .
But every hundreds , something happened , and one of these artists become reality .
And I know what you talk about what you are all of , because I know you 've seen , a very formance .
It was like the time you stop , and the ballowing wald through a species of bring and not doing nothing from the sought , as the 1,000 , but all you 're on the sleeping 1,000 , but all you 're all slots .
And at the improvement , not just like a human human human .
But you accined from the divinity and under the west wood in the winity of divinity .
And when this is , you have to the time , people knew what was called his name .
They were the hands and , they started slyta , " Allah , Allah , Allah , ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫
That 's God , you know .
And I think note stories -- when the More invasered the Spagan , I was this abitude with their own and the changing in the secos of " Allah , Allah , " ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫
In Spay , when a artist has done something impossible and magic , " Allah , " Allah , " Allah , I 'm going to buy , I was going to be , " I 'm going to be .
And it 's great because we need .
But the problem is the next day , and the ballery , when you get up and they discoping that are the 11 of Martedayed Martedayed and I walk up with God .
It 's just a mortal mortal with gineye , and maybe not will never be able to assumption to clear that altitude .
And maybe no canterm will be the name of God still , and what 's going to do with his life ?
It 's hard .
This is one of the most pathiliation of the most pathium to make in a creative life .
But maybe it doesn 't have to be so angosciention if you could not believe , moving , that the most extraordinary of your own being being from your own being from you 're going to the same .
But you have to make you all the data in prested by a inimaginable ininimaginable of this squisity part of your life that you 've got to get up to something else when you 're going to stop .
And , you know , if we think about this way .
And so I started thinking , and it 's sure , and it 's sure as I thought about for different months during the book that I was working on the book that publishing , I 'm going to be able to my own own own great great great degree .
And what I have to keep me when I feel when I feel eltated by this is , not not have to be .
Don 't just your work . It 's just your work .
It 's to presenting your part of your part , whatever it can be .
If your work is balling , you get ,
If the divine , assumption , I asked up to leave some kind of wonderful wonderful , for one moment through your sforce , and then you go through your sweet , " Ole ! "
You 've got the same tumor .
And " Ole ! "
I think you have to teach it .
" On it , it 's just for you , even had a human love and head , and tals to make you keep them to keep you keep up .
Thank you .
Thank you .
June Cohen : Ole !
You know , I 've been talking about some of these projects on the human genome , what can meaning and discovered new genes .
Now we 're beginning a new percording , we started digitalize biology and now to the biology and now we 're both in a new fashion of biology , designing and saying , and saying ,
We always have to take big questions .
" What is life ? " Is it something that many biologists I think they have tented to understand the livels .
We 've tried different approach , reduced to the terms .
We 're digitalize in the hort years .
When we have sequenced the human genome was going to go from the world world 's world 's the world of the digital world .
Now we ask , we can we regenerate life , or new life from this digital universe ?
This is the map of a little organism , the Mycoplasma genitalium , which is the species from the genome that can autorest in the laboratory .
And we 've tried to reduce the genome to make a still fall of the one one again .
We 're able to eliminate a centinail of the slightly about 500 that are here .
But when we go to his mapa map , it 's relatively simple respond to our .
So , I think is simple .
But when we look at all the genes we can eliminate , once you can get this is very improbly that this can bring to a living cells .
So we decided that the only to provide that was sintetize to this cromodify , so that they will be modifly to the components to the some of these questions .
And so we started the " We can we start the " We can sent a cromosoma ? "
It 's chemicals to produce these big molecules that we 've never been able to create before ?
And in case , in case , we can we work a cromosom ?
A cromosom is just a piece of material chemimic material .
The speed with which we are able to digitalize life is going to grow exponential life .
Our ability to write the genetic code , instead , instead , I 'm deeply lently , but it 's better .
And our most recent recent recrecent result on a exponential curve .
We started more than 15 years ago .
The process has requires a lot of pass , beginning with a bioetic revision .
But we found that DNA is very difficult to DNA is very difficult .
There are thousands of thousands of thousands of DNA , segments of the longer than 30 to 50 lectest and it 's a longer process : the segment is long more than 30 to have .
So we had to develop a new metodo to develop these framments and correct these framments and correct the herrors .
And this was our first tentative first , to go to digital information of the digital genome of Phi 174 .
It 's a little virus that kild batterns .
We designed the framments , effectured the correction of the errors and have a molecule of DNA of about 5,000 lectable lectured .
The interesting part is when we took this piece of chemical material and we 've inert it in the batterns , the batterns have started to read this code and protected this code and producing viral particles .
The viral particles are now now reflected by the cells , are back and they distruted the Ecocrowed .
I talked about recent membraning with membraning of oil industry that they have certainly compress that they have certainly compress .
They have remember more than you .
We believe that this is a situation where the software can actually build his own own own own own own own own own own own system .
But we wanted to do things in larger .
We had to build the interest cromosom of the battern .
They 're more than 580 mies , the lectest of code .
So we thought of build it in seven casses of the virus , so that we could change the cassed seven to understand what the behaving of a living cells .
The designers is crucial , and if we start with digital computers in a computer , these have to be very accurate .
When we sequenced this genome for the first time in 1995 , the accurateess was a herror for every 10 mile of a herror .
We found , resequences , 30 erros , 30 error , we used that original sequence , we would never be able to do that .
A part of the process is designers in 50 lectiny 50 lectiny to make suvestids with all other segments of 50 lectest that work together .
We 're going to be a unique elements here .
You know , you know that we 've read a flower of flower .
Think about this : We have a code code on four lect-based on four , and Two , and T.
Three of those lectures together , and there 's about 20 love minods , and there 's a specific order to lectest .
So we can use the genetic code to write words , framazing , depensive .
What we 've done in the beginning was autographs .
Some of the fact that it was not in the fact that it was not poetime .
We designed these segments to just make them a very simply une with me .
There are these things that reparan and put them .
And we started to assembling to fall , beginning with seven seven mile of five to seven mile , unending in a way to form of 24 mile the lective lecting until lecting to 72 mile .
So , we have produced these sequences in a hundance , so that we 're trying to create a building a process of creating process that we 're trying to create a minute .
We 're trying to automationship the process .
So , this seems to be a playwake of a lower player .
When we go to these very long long , more than 100 mile , more than 100 mile , they 're not going to grow up in Ecocar .
You get to the limits of the modern modern biology of biology .
So we 've been considered other monitary monitary .
We had another mectual mechanism called recombination recombination , which in biology , which in biology is used to repearing the DNA power to slow segments .
Here 's an example .
This organism , called Deinococcus , he can assumption three million running .
You can see in the requarter as his cromosome , like his cromosoma .
In 12 hours , it looked at exactly like it was before .
There are thousands of organisms that are able to do it .
These organisms can seouth .
I 'm living under vacacacross .
They 're absolutely certain life in space , and you have to find new environments of water .
It 's true , NASA has shown that this is .
This is a imagine of the molecule that we 've built these processes , just using these processes with the design of the design of the property of the property of the property .
The lived them to make them automatically .
This picture is not been scaced with a microscope , but with a microscope , but with a microscope .
It 's a molecool that we can see it with a microscope with a microscope .
These are pictures that they are a period of about six seconds .
This is the publilication we 've done a time ago .
They 're more than 580,000 lectable of code .
It 's the most great molecule of a defined defined structure of a man .
It 's a lot of summmer ,
If we ststammmed with a career , there would like 142 page , there would just 142 page .
Now , how do we do it ? How can we do it ?
Of course , tramite a virus is a game of girls .
It 's a little bit more complicated when they use batterns .
It 's also as a cell , when it 's cell ekariote as our own : you can just extractly the nucleo and inserve one , which is basically the process of clonation .
In the bacterium battern cromosoma is instead of the cell , but we have recently demonstrated that we 're able to do a trant transplant , and we 've recently demonstrate it .
We 've got a cromosom , and we 've got a microbial species .
The two different are different as holds from the options .
We added some gene genes in the way to decide what I could squeeeemosoma .
The sciolden scioldes in the way to kill all the proteins .
And when we put it in the cells was study -- and we put our graphical graphical graphical graphical -- the new cell .
And we started that we didn 't go to , but we 've tried to spend up , but we 've tried to spend up there .
This is one of the most mechanisms of evolution .
We found that many many species have added a second or a third or a third hundred a second hundreds of new trats of new trats .
So who think about the evolution as a only time you 're going to be able to understand of biology .
There 's the restription of the restription that aditting digerism , they 're digerisn 't .
The cromosom that was in the cells not a possibly .
The cell phula-cell cromosom we have inserit-hour .
And I got it , and it remember the other cromosom as a material as a material , and we 're returned with only the cell and the new cell cell and the new cell and the new cell .
It 's become became blue because of the genes we have inserious .
And in a short legs of time , all the carteristics of a species are lost lost , and it 's transformed in a new species , based on the new software that we inside in the cells .
All the proteins are changed , and when we law , and when we law the code code code that we 've been traveling you .
Now , this may seem alchemy genetic genetic genetic , but software we can change the things in manist enough .
Now , I 've already explained that here don 't talk about the genesis -- but of designers from three million years and a half years of evolution , and I said that maybe to create a new version of the Cambrian explosion of the species on this digital process .
Why do that ?
I think it 's enough enough , when we think about our needs to need .
We 're to go from six billion and a half billion people in the next 40 years .
Right to give an example : I 'm none in 1946 .
Now , there are three people on the planet for each other , in 1946 , there 's three years , there will be four .
We 're now now now to find food now now , water , water , and you pull , and you welling them and a half billion and a half billion and a half billion people .
It 's going to be more drawings .
We have more than five billion coowner , more than 30 billion , more than 30 billion baries .
That means millions of the millions of the day .
When we try to find biologic processes , or any kinds of process to remping them , will be a huge challenge .
We have to keep all the emission of the CO2 materials that finishes in the atmosphere .
At day , thank you very scientific discovered in all the world , we have a database with about 20 million genes , and I like to think they are the design .
The electronics industry is just a dozen about components , and you think about how many things are coming out .
Our limits here are major biological reality and our imagination .
Now we have techniques , thank you very much metods of these metods of the techniques , we can make what we call genomics .
We 're able to build a big robot that can produce a million cromosomes at a day .
Think of the processing of these 20 million genes or different genes or to try to get either , new vaccines or or they 're going to make or drugs , and create more biology , we can change , and create more biology , and create biology , and create more biology , and create more of-years of science .
And it 's just a standard standard .
We can choose to survive for a supply , production or carbon , production , production of the cemistry .
This is an anea of some software programmed to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to several and design species .
Well , we don 't know how they will be .
We know exactly comfortable is their genetic code .
Now we 're concentrating the carbon of quarter of the generation .
You 've seen you that you can get back from grate a grate experiment .
We have second carbon second second and third generation that are going to be such a carbon high high value or different butanol .
But the only way that biology can have a big impact of the world 's impact without car without car energy and limited the disponing the disponing of the food would be transforming CO2 months , which we 're working to design cells that can be working for the carbon property of the world , and we think about that cocarbons of what the gards of the world 's worth of how much generation in about 18 months .
The sunlight with CO2 is a metodow -- but in our discovered in our world , we found different metods .
This is a organism that we have been described in 1996 .
It 's in the deep deep , about 2500 feet deep deep deepness of ebollions of ebollions .
They 're out of the CO2 hygen , as a molecular energy as energy .
We 're trying to understand if we can indowny if we can indownnice , which can be translate that can be translate that CO2 in carbon , to drive this process .
So , we think we could be able to increase what the question of the question of the base that the question of the base that the question of the base that the question is , " We have the modness of remaining the whole industry .
Exactly . If you don 't do that TED , where you can 't do it from TED , where you can 't do it from TED , where you can 't do it from TED , where you can 't do that TED ,
It would be a main the craft .
And so we 're working for using the same metods to create vaccines .
You 've seen this year with influence , we 're always back to a year and with a dollar in less when it 's going to find the right .
I think that 's going to change fight up with combinable in antician in antician in antician .
Here 's how the future could we start to look at changing , now , the treme of evolution , acceping the evolution of the evolution of bacteria , and then you go , and then then then the cell ekariote .
We 're so on the best people .
Our discovered to live enough enough to live enough to try to make cells . Thank you very much .
But I 'm all to show you , the most rapidly possible , some fundamental work , some fundamental work , of the technology we 've taken to a lot of a year ago . This is Seadragon .
This is a environment that you can interact is to local level that remote with a huge amount of data .
Here we 're seeing a lot of digital photos with a photos with a kind of photos and continue , for a fastern wrote , and then , I say .
And it doesn 't matter how big quantities is that we see , how big these are great these collection collection of data or the picture .
Most of the digital photographs , but this is a scansion is a provide from Biooowned from Biooowned from Biooothern Congress .
It doesn 't make any difference because the only thing that 's limit is the prestations of a system like this is the number of pixel on your screen in your screen . It 's also a very flexist .
This is a book , example of data , you don 't have images .
This is the Casa desolder Dickens . Ogn coloned a capitself .
So I 'm going to show you that it 's just just a lot of images , we can do a thing about what it is a real representation of a representation , you can actually see that it 's a picture .
It could be a little artificial way to read a book to read a book .
You don 't have to be .
This is an example , it 's a more realistic number of the Wardian .
Every picture is the beginning of a section .
And there 's really the floor and beautiful experience of the version of a version or a quote of a squotidian or a quotidian , which is for nature molecular .
We also made something with the angle of this particular number of the Look .
We 've created a public public addressed -- much more alt than that you use in a normal published -- and we 've been inserious .
If you want to see the carteristics of this automobile , you can see here .
Or other models , or even specific model .
And this really demonstrates some of these ideas to eliminate the limits of space on the screen .
We 're going to be able to put up and other pop-up and other pop-up and other pounds , not have to be necessary .
In fact , the map is one of the most obvious applications of the most of technology .
And on this won 't want to lose time , if we don 't say that we have to give up in this camp .
These are all the streets in the USA suvestered picture of NASA .
So now we 're going to see what else is .
This is actually actually actually , from the vive , you can see it .
This is a project called Photosynth , which combine two different technologies .
A Seadragon and the other is a visual research computer very interesting to the computer , student from Noah Snavily , student from the Washington , with Seitz Seitz Seitz Steve Seitz Seitz Seitz Steve .
And it 's from Seadragon , gests from Seadragon .
You can see it when we do this kind of screen , where we can go from a picture and have this kind of extremendous revolution .
But the space of the spaces of the picture here has a significant meaning .
The algorithms of visualization of the computer have these images together , so that corresponding to light , so that the images of the records in which the picture -- all of the way , and all the neighborn Montaghi Rocten cancer -- they 're watted to the slide . What you see , you can see the floor of things are .
I don 't know if I 've time to show you some other environment .
There are some more space .
I want to go to one of the original data , of the original data from a precedent of Photosynthhotosynthree-totype of Photosynthree-time , to show you what it is really the technology is the cave back to the world . And it 's not necessarily , the technology that we have in the website . And it 's not necessary to look at the website .
We had to worry about the ladies and forward .
This is a rebuild the catthedral cattedral cattedral Look from Flickr . Baast digitary . Baast Flickr and you get pictures in Flickr and you get up . On the field of these control the arcion this model .
So , I 'm all picked by Flickr and they 've been all colleaged to this way .
And it 's possible to navigate this way .
You know , I never had ever thought to end Microsoft .
It 's very gratificating this kind of across here .
I think you 're seeing that is a lot of different different kinds of different kinds of fun , from those phones of those phones , SLR , a number of the phones , SR , a number of meaning , and it 's a lot of meaning together in this environment .
And if you 're going to try to try to look at those more strange .
A lot of these are blown , etc .
So , some part of a photographs , I 've got a series of photographs .
This is a poster of Notre Dame correctly .
We can go from the moving vision of this environment .
The point is that we can do with the environment is that we can do with the environment . This is taking data from the intermemory , from the point of visual , and college all of the way , and college all those data together .
All the photos , most of the som of the som parts .
You have a model of the land of the land that emerging .
Think of this as a such of Stephen Lawler 's work on Earth .
It 's something that growing in hands that people are using , and the people who are using it , and the whatever they use it .
They are pictures with metades from other people .
If someone is the idea of the idea of these saying , all these saying nome , my picture of the chtedral cattedral chtedral . And I can use of all these data , and I can use how to get you to engining in the space , and I can use it in the universe , and you can use the photos of the red world , and you have a cysis , and they cle-mosquare cle-mos-mos-mosquare ckysssssssssaying .
In fact , a consequence of all of this are model , extremely elaborated , and I 'm not just so much of the land , I 'm not going to be able to village and similar satellular and similar satellular ,
Thank you very much .
Chris Anderson : I understand what your software there to us to do is that you can do is that a point , in the next few years , in the next years , all the photographs , all the photographs in the world will be able to be colleaged with anyway together ?
BA : Yes . What 's 's doing is doing is to discover .
It 's creating hyperlink , if you want , you , between pictures .
And it 's doing it in the base of the images .
The thing becomes very interesting if you think about the receive of information that security of these images that many of these images .
As when you do a research on the web , you digit , and the texton the web pay and the texture of the picture .
Now , what happens if that picture is the picture of all your picture ?
So the amount of interconnection and the quantity of recognize that is really huge . It 's a huge classic classic . It 's a classical classical class .
CA : Blaise , it 's really incredible .
BAA : I 'm going to thank you very .
One of the main piaces when you travel and one of the research search of research chest research is the power of who have not dimented the anti-traditions , between the past , the wind in the wind , the plegen in the floor of the floating ,
Basti think that sciamans Jaguar travel still beyond the Via Lattea , or that the mites are still college , or that the mites are still college , or the good depths of Dharm , to remember the most important thing , to remember the most important thing , and the most important thing that we live in sense , but it 's just a sense of a sense of sense , but it 's just a sense of a sense of the idea of the most of the idea of the world ,
The consequence of a particular screen of a particular maptative that our stroy , or a lot of generations ago .
And , of course , we all share the trats .
We all all of them . We all have . We all have .
We are subjects to the beginning of the beginning .
We have to fall the inesorability of death , so we don 't surprising and ballide if we clear and ballies .
We all have a art .
What 's the way that is the run particular song , the run of the song of every culture .
It doesn 't matter that are the forest of the Borneo , or the following Voodoo , or the wodow , or the wodow , or the werodoor , Kenya sstouched , or a wake of Sahara .
He was my company in the desert of viage in the desert a month or a month ago , or a high of the switch , the demother , the demother of the world .
All of these places us that there are other ways of existing other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , other ways of moving in the world .
And if you reflected a moment , it 's a concept that can give you hope .
So , I realized , my re-cultures of the world creating retural records and cultural that 's important for the planet and cultural well-being as the planet as the re-nature of the world as the ragela .
And you can think about this cultural extremely cultural , and you can call the etnossmoke , and you can call the som of all the concepts , ideas , and , ideas , inspired , ideas , inspired , intuition , intuition , intuition .
The etnossmothnossis patrimonium .
It 's the symbols of what we are and what we can be in how species .
And it 's been graved by the beods has been very very high , it 's happened to the etnossh and purching much more .
Nooogist , for example , it would say that 50 percent of all species has been or is about the orders of all species , because it 's flew , or -- in the world 's hypose -- in the world 's the most different sequity -- and you don 't even even even even more than the poight-points -- that fun in the world .
The indiction of all this is , obviously , the loss of languistic .
When you 're nated 6,000 languages on this planet .
A language is not only only only only by a vocabolary or a series of rules .
A language is the sprazy of human spirit .
It 's the midle with the animal that the animal revenue of all culture .
Elguy is a forest of mind , a messing , a thought , a thought , a thought of the ability .
And those 6,000 language language , as we seat at Monterey , at least half not more supply in the oreckers .
They 're not teaching children , the who means , the means , at least that you don 't won something , which are already die .
What 's there more trils of being from the silence , the last slightly , the last to talk about a language , not how to transmitting the sages of the pattern or to spacing the damage of the children ?
This orring was a flowed of someone in some part of every few weeks , every weeks , every weeks are a moving moving and bring with the ulsyllabe of a language .
And I know someone should say , " Isn 't it ?
The world would be a better place if we talked all the same language ? " Benism , then we talk all yorba . We talk about . We 're talking about .
We 're going to kogical .
You 're going to be a tracking thing to say , not to talk to your language .
Today , I would like to make a viage through the etnossmothnossmoke .
a little journey in the etnosed of what we 're losing .
Many of us dimented that when I say , " different ways of existing existing existing .
We take for example , we take for example , in Amazony , Amazony sector , the popular west , which credeal of the west walking on the fest challs of the sacet in the pants of the sacers .
This is a popular popular , that 's not able to distinguy the blue because the blue is identify identify in the forest time , which depends the popular popular .
They have a strange language and a mathematrimonial , " existic languistic languistic , " You have to sleeping a different language .
All has radical in the past mostly , yet the particularity is that in these families that are are in these families or seven seven or seven language , no one line .
They 're limited to astold and then we start to talk .
We take one of the tribes of the most interesting of what I 've lived , the Wails of the Ecuador , a incredible that has been control that has been the first contately contatts in 1958 .
In 1957 five missionary , they have tented a common a further .
They 've done by the photographs that they were recording in a few that they were recording that they had no long-dimensional forest , and that this population had never seen anything of bi-dimensional photographs .
They 've been told the picture of the earth , they have been on a shape or a shape and , not find nothing , they 're going to be able , and they killed the direct of the slowing , and they killing five missionary with the lance .
But the Waorani not only killed the straniests .
They killing between them .
The 54 percent of mortality was caused by their same .
We 're saying , you 've been generations and we found two cases of morte and when we 've been told to know , they have loved that one of them was invected that one of them was dead , and then they killed it .
The clacers were able to recognize the animal from 40 pass and recognize the species .
In the first years , I was assigned a very interesting company when my professor , I really interesting when I wanted to go to Haiti and I asked me to Haiti in the SSaitary and the power of the power of Duvard and the power of the power of Duvard and I can do the faster of the speed of the speed , and I can do the zombiomer to do .
So , I would have to make a sense , I would have to understand culture of Vodoor and that Vodoor is not magnine .
This is pretty pretty much of a complex complex metaphphysical vision .
So , many interesting .
If I ask you to say , I 'm going to me , what would you ?
We have to restanesim , Buddism , Budddism , etc .
A continent is always left out , thinking that Africa is not not have to be a messed of religious religious . And instead of religious . And I 'm not that the distilled to these religious concepts of these religious concepts of these religious concepts of these things that are very profound deep in the waiting .
What makes the voodoor is the intense is the intense is the intense of life and death .
So , the way you can come to the spirits .
The spiriters can be invest by the Grande Acqua , they respond to the ritm of the dance and they replaced temporary to the site of the way that for a short ,
So , the voodoists are love to say , " You can go to talk about about God .
We 're in the temple and diventioned God . "
And from the moment you 're sitting , it 's the spirit that you can do you , how you can do the mal ?
So you 're incredible to these incredible events , followers in been transplens that touched a demonstration of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power when it is catalized in a state of the body state in a state of the body that 's kind of indeed .

All cultures through the seced sects in a dance for new possibilities of life .
And the problem is not the technology .
The Indians Sioux didn 't have to be Sioux when they put up up and free , and they have so much as Americans have been been born to be Americans when they put out of the calculate and it .

The grand-grand-hand-up of this man man 's going to go .

It 's their new patria . It 's called Nunavoid .
It 's a territoral territoral territoral reaming all the resources .
One splendiment of how a nation-state can remember with his popular popular .
And , to finish , I think it 's pretty obvious at least who has been in these zone remote exactly the planet , it makes that they 're not affected .
For somebody is home .
They represent sections of human imagination , humans , and for us all the time . And for us all , the sogers of these children , as the sogers , become part of our children , become part of the hope of the hope of hope .
For finally , we have to be convince we are convince that political political political arrivers will never be nulone .
We believe that polemiics --

Our work is traveling in the moment to bring our audience in places of wondered , where they will go out and they will go out and they 're going to be able to be , and hope , you can 't get to reve-hicle in the world : the world 's world 's such of the world , and we have to find a lot of life in a world , and multural world .
where the saggeness of all the people can contributing to our benefit to our blue benefit .
Thank you .
I 'm going to talk about some things I wrote in this book that I hope you 've heard and I 'm going to be able to be able to be able to be some colleages , in the case , in case not .
I want to start with what I call the dogma , "
The dogames of what ?
The dogggufficial industrial industrial ocred , the West dogen city : " If we want to massive citizens the citizens of our citizens " The way to do is massive liberty . "
The reason , it 's a late , in the fact that the liberty is in the same value , it 's prevous , it 's prevous for humans .
In the other one is in the fact that if we are libers , each of us can act for all of what massive massive our benefit , without any any that decided our wasn 't any any that decided to our own nothing .
The way to massive to massive liberty is massive to massive scels .
The choice , people have , more are more are liberty , and most is their liberty , and most is their benefits .
This , I think , it 's so deeply radicated in society that no one would be able to put it in the doubt .
And it 's also deeply radicated in our lives .
I 'm going to show you some examples of what the progress has possible .
This is my supermarket . It 's not particularly great .
I 'm going to be a simple note to injumped .
In my supermarket , there are 175 conditions , without contrise of the Everyone one 's please of holist and 12 acetes , and 12 huge of the condition in the pattern in the pattern in the pattern in the pattern condition of your dededededegree .
Here 's the supermarket .
Then you go to the electronics to buy a stereo , you put a stereo , sleeper , leaver , radio , leave .
And in this single electronics , there 's a big number of components .
We can make six million and half million different half million and a half million different components that there are in a only negotial .
You have to love to love that there is very very choice .
Altri camps : the world of the communications .
As , when I was a kid , you could get all the serve telephone , and they were able to pat the bottom of the mothers who were wasking from mamma mom .
It was recording the phone , they didn 't buy it .
A consequence of that , between the other , was that the phone has never been romped .
These tempes .
We have a variety of the phones , especially between phones , specifically between the phones .
Here 's the cellular cell phones .
My favorite is the midle , MP3 , I 'm wrong with the naso , and forward in the nass , and forward for the burch .
If you don 't have seen it in the negotie in home , you 're going to take it .
And what happens is that the people get in the negospaces in the negogoes and this question is . " The answer is " No . "
It 's not possible to buy a phone that doesn 't do it 's not to find things .
So , in other aspects of life that are much more important of the plosion of the plosion of the extremendous exists .
Again , the sanitary : it doesn 't happen in the United States , and the doctor and the doctor and the doctor what you have to do .
So , you wave from the doctor , and the doctor says , " OK , we could do . " Okay , " You can do , " A " A " A " A " A " A " Those , " You know , " You know , and these risks . What do you want to do ? "
You say , " Dottore , what I should do ? "
And the doctor says , " A has these benefits , and these benefits and these benefits and these guys and these risks . "
" What do you want to do ? "
And you rebecame , " Dottore if she was me , what would do ? "
And the doctor : " But I 'm not . "
The result is called " autonomonomy of the disease , expression that does it seems to look like a beautiful thing .
But actually , it 's not that one is that a spot and responsibility to somebody knows something , you know , you know , at any other than anything anything , and somebody else -- and so that doesn 't know , and so it doesn 't know it 's a lot of the ideal complives .
There 's a huge marketing products , demust be produced to people like me and you , you think if you think it doesn 't have any sense , because you can 't understand them .
But if we can 't buy them , why they can publishing them ?
The answer is that they want to doctor to make the doctor for asking to change us .
Something that 's the fundamental as is our identity is a kind of choice , as you see in this visual vignized , " We don 't want to force children . " We don 't want to get to be a drid of identity : we have to invent .
And we can reinventing how many times we can do it .
which means that every morning , at the time , you have to decide that kind of person want to be .
I 'm going to be a family and matrimonium , a time , a common time , until you could be able to be , and I was that you can get the most time , and we started to figure out the most price .
The only truth was with who , not when you 're doing it , and not not what to do after .
So , all of it 's really to play .
I mean , very intelligent students , and I have 20 percent in less of work ,
And it 's not because they 're not because they 're not not because they 're dealing .
But why I 'm impensieritites , I would say , " I would say , " I would I do that now ? "
" Do I should I think about the later , I had to think before or the career ? "
They 're interrogatives .
And they 're trying to answer these questions , even if this implessing is not completely to be able to be doing a vote to my extremely .
And they have to be doing this . They are questions .
Now , the work : We 're lucky , as Carl sound , because the technology lots of us to work every day , every day , every angle of the planet , in the planet , trannotion of the planet ,
It was parently , there 's a angin , and I don 't tell you that , where the Wighborn , where the WiFi works .
I don 't say , because I want to use it .
What means , this incredible liberty of choice that we have to work on work on work ? That 's going to be doing , and if we have to work or not .
We can go to see our son son , with the calculate , with the cell phone , the Blackberry in the other , and the nteam , and the nteam , and the nteam .
And even though they are all spent , we see our child , we 're also asking our child , we 're also asking this , " Do I had to answer this called ? "
" I had to answer this email ? I had to abboze this letter ? "
And when the answer is " no , all this makes the experience of your driving extremendous party of your child .
So , from any part of the things , and big things , and big materials , and they 're stuck of life , and life is a question of choice .
On time the world was this : Ovge , there were some possibility , but not all was a scale isn 't a question of choice .
The world today is that 's such is , " The dilemma is , " That 's a positive thing , or negative ? "
The answer is South .
The positions of the slight-concerned , and I 'm going to talk about those negative .
All this choice two effects two effects actually two effects on people .
The first , paradoxis , it 's produces that produces instead of that liberation .
With options of the options of what you wodds , it becomes very difficult to do .
I 'm going to offer example , a condot , a condot slightly fly .
A my colleaged to have been access to the data , the games of the flower of thinking , with about a billion clients of works in 2,000 different company .
What she discovered is that for every 10 solutions that are offered in more , the percentage of adesion of the floor percent .
With 50 percent of offered , there 's 10 percent in less adesions of adesions when they 're dispone-de-five percent . Why ?
Because with 50 of flower that is , it 's hard to decide , and the choice is hard to decide , and the choice is remaining questions .
And questions , and I still questions , questions , and of course , and of course , and of course , and of course , and of course , and of course , and of course , and of course , and of course , and of course , and of course , and of course , the questions , and of course , the questions , and of course , and I 'm going to questions ,
You know , that means that they don 't only means that these old old old old old old food for cans because they don 't have enough enough enough enough , they want to say that the decision is so ostics that they 're allowed to be the source of the work of the work .
Don 't talk , they 're lost to five dollars from the dator of work , that would be be true .
So the paralized paralysis to have a consequence .
And I think it makes the world .
" And to finish , to the eternity : ketched , senape or maionth ? "
You can actually take the decision , if it 's the right decision , it 's for the eternity , right ?
You don 't want to choose the bottom , and you don 't want to choice .
So this is the first effect . The second is that we can get the paralize and make a choice , and we can do a scale , at least at least as we were with the result of how we would be with less than the options of what we would choose .
And that 's for different reasons .
A one of these is that with tants of the conditions that you have to be a lot of you buy and it 's not perfect , and it 's not perfect , you can do a fun that it is that happening is that the alternative images , and the recording to the screen to the choice , and the recording to the floor , and the recording to the decision ,
And when it was a decision .
The choice , there are , more is easy , more is easy to be dispiages that it 's insodness of the option .
And there is what economists economists .
Dan Gilbert has asked very good stamattine as the value that we 're depends on what we 're doing .
In the rest , when there are many options , it 's easy to represent the carteristic carteristic scared and be less soften and being less under subsides of the option that you are .
Here 's an example . I 've been in New York .
But it 's what you probably think .
There 's this cople to Hamptons .
A place of luser place .
It 's favored . Ottim . It 's all about it . It 's all for them .
Not nothing . But what he think is , " Well , it 's Agogogotten , it 's Agogogod . "
" All my neighbors are . "
" I could talk about right right to right right right at home . "
And it 's going to two weeks , that 's allowed -- every day -- every day -- the possibility of parking where they want .
The opportunity diminutes the suddddddouble for what we have , even when the choice was old .
And the options we have to think we have to think , more the carteristics that you 've got to realize , you know how expensive opportunity .
Here 's another example .
This is a lot of things .
We talk about the moment , and maybe the living moment , and maybe living lently .
But the most important point is that any thing you have to choice , you can 't do other .
The things that we don 't choose to have table to make less attractive what we do .
Terzo , it 's exactly growth .
I tried on my pattern pining a new couple of jeans .
I 'm almost always jeans .
As a time , the jeans were just a kind of , comprecords and they were bestivestivestivestivestires , and they were going to go well .
So , I went to buying a couple when the old old old one couple when they went , and I said , " I 'm a couple of jeans , this is my table . "
The committed me , " Li wants to slim , easy , relaxed ? "
Who wants to the cernight or with the bottons ? " Stonewashed " or " " Do " "
" Who wants to strapped ? "
" Sott them want to them to be a lot of bla ? Bla , " The bla -- " Continured them .
I was sbalordit , and after a little bit I could say , " I want to say , " I want to say , " I want to what it was not , " Don 't know what it was , for a hour , and then you 've got out of the jeans , with the best pleasure of jeans , with the best cople of jeans , I 'm going to have .
It was the massive , I had all of that choice had been doing the best .
But I feel worse .
Why ? I wrote a book to understand it .
The reason I was worse , I was worse with all of the scels were altical , jeans had to be perfectly .
I was expectative minime . I didn 't expected nothing when I was just a kind of exceptional , when I 'm living , you 're going to 100 different kind of being perfect .
What I had buy was good , but not perfect .
After I had paragoned that what I was trying to me to insoddisfact , I was insodly in the expectations .
The addition of the people don 't have to make the expectations that these have respond to the old people that have respond to the old of the same .
And this will be less soddriven , even when the results are good .
None in the marketing world 's marketing in the world .
Because if I knew it , you don 't know what I 'm talking about .
The truth truth is more to this .
" The reason when he was worse when he was going to be better when he was better when he was going to be better when he was worse , he was still going to met .
As the world we live -- opulent , industralized industralized citizens with the expection of the performing of the performing of the expection of the expectitiative things are in the expectitiative .
You never have surprising surprising , because your expectative , because your expectative , you are ingiganties .
The secret of happiness -- what you 're here -- is , " Well , " Well , " Yes , " Yes , " Yes , you want . "
I mean , I mean , I 'm going to say -- that I 'm really sitting and my wife is really study .
I don 't have to do better , I don 't have to do better ,
But it 's not always a good thing .
And then , one consequence of the jeans when there is only that kind of jeans is just that when you 're not to be such , and you ask , and you know , and I said , " Why ? "
" Who is responsible ? " Well , the answer is that .
The world is the responsible responsible . What I could I do ?
When there are hundreds of jeans , and you buy a soddisfactor , and you ask you , and you ask you , and you ask you is the responsible responsible to you .
You should do better .
With hundreds of varieties , there are not scale for the insuccessful .
So when people take decisions , even if the result is valid , you know , you know , they sently and they dought the colpying their own .
In the last years years , the depression is expression in the industralized world .
I think a fatter factor , not the only , but important -- that 's important -- that 's the people are actually actually that people have experiences of the people have expressed experiences because they 're too alts .
And when they 're explaining this situation is their collies .
So the end end is that we 're doing it is that we 're better , objectively , but we feel worse .
Let me remember .
This is the doggames , what we all take for good and it 's completely fall . It 's completely flow .
There 's no doubt that a little bit of choice is better than that you don 't have to get it , but it doesn 't have a little bit better than that much as a little bit better .
There 's a critical value , I don 't know what it is .
But I 'm sure we have such from a piece of the level where the best scels are the best .
Now , from the political point -- I 've been on the political point -- from the political point of vision is the following is the following .
What you can allow all this choice in society industry is the remember .
There are many places in the world , and you know , you know , where the problem is not that they have been choice .
The problem is that they too poor .
So the face of the factory that I 'm talking about is a diseases of modern , remember of the modern , remember .
And what does depriming and it 's this : Steve Levitt talked about how they talked about how those those are and discovered and discovered the bottom . It 's a spreping money . It 's a sprepatters .
I mean these choices , complicated and dispendispendispends , it 's not just inuseful .
They 're admitting .
They do it worst .
If a little bit of what in our society allows were reversed in those where people who are too much as they were under their lives , but also would be better , but also be the best .
This is what economists are called a better paretian .
A redistribution of the redent ago , not just to all the poverty -- not just to poverty -- not just to be population that we go back .
Fanch , " Fwonderful , you can become everything you want to what you , "
You know , people think , you think , " But what creds that fish ? "
" It 's obvious that you can 't have to get up in a bocks . "
" A cocastrated imagination , a limited vision of the world -- "
And I 've interpreted this , at the beginning .
But then , I think , instead , I 'm realize that that that fish the fall .
Because the reality of the fact that if you get to frantum , it 's so that , " all of it 's possible .
If you rock the bottom way that all you can divent the fast death .
Amentually , and you reduced the well-being .
All they need a fer .
This is almost certainly too much much , maybe even for the fish , and sure for sure .
But the asn 't some symbolic symbolic sfetime , and we teach , for the rovation .
Thank you very much heart .
