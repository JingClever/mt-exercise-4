They went to show these disappeared these slives to show that the ballower glacial , which for a size of the 48 million years had the United States of the United States , is rerecord of the United States .
And that 's this sound , the gravity of the problem because it doesn 't show it the gets of the glessor .
The glacial glacial is , in a sense , in a sense of the climate system .
It 's saves and you get out of the estate .
The next next is going to be a rapid carled by the last 25 years .
The gets ales are saying in the red .
And , you see , you see it 's the blue .
That 's the game , which is the game , which is the gestate .
You can see that the cosidyslightly , of five years or five years , is like the slights , which is like the site , which is like the site .
In 25 years ago , so , so , so it 's so .
This is a problem because the run of the terilacier , the threaten around the ocean , where there are huge of coalyslight-congels , they 're transformed to put in the microbes .
Right to the totalks about the trackage of the global rescale , that quantity could readly , that 's radly , superhaps you don 't get around .
In some lackage , the properd in Alaska meter , the meter is already to the water .
The professorite Katey Walter Walter 's the University is reacted with a team .
Video : Wow . Wow : You 're good . The question is if we 're going to be .
A reason is that this scale is that scale to the Groend Groend .
This is a figure out a regime .
And he had never reached them .
This is the figure Kangerlushaq , in the sudd-obs of the Groens .
If you want to know how to be the sal of the mate of the game of the gains , here is where you reach the must , here is where you reach the mb .
These corrents are are aumenting .
And in the planet : Antartartttartttartttartttartttartttarttarttartttartttarttttars , the most biggest .
The country wrote the scientists have asked the banthiacily , and that the Antartartartartartarttarttarttars , which is particularly in a hery , is particularly in the midddle .
Equid six meters of the active of the active of the across the Groens .
Sull Himalaya , the third bigger than the green , you see new new laghi , who were populled .
And 40 percent of the world 's worth remember , the population of the water .
Sulle : this gets is the glacier of the water .
And the burn is aumented .
And so when it diminues , the same happens to the water .
In California the Sight-Nevada is diminually .
The gets remember is in the crisis .
The predictions , like you know , they 're graves .
The growing growing in the world world 's translaughting a night .
The environmental environmental environmenting out of the normal and without precedents .
Four times in the last 30 years , the last 30 years , the first first of 75 .
This is a beautiful beautiful .
If you look at the context of the context , if you can see the consequences .
In the last five years we added 70 million tons of CO2 , 25 million tons of CO2 -- 25 million tons of ton-hold ocean every day .
Look at the area of the area of Pacific , and the danger , and you get to the sest parts of the interest , where there 's a radical redition , where there 's a radical radical hygen in the ocean .
Most of the global rescale , together , together to the global deforest , which is the 20 percent , is the usually , is the usually .
The oil is a problem , and the cooil is character .
The United States are one of the two countries with the most emissions , together together , together .
And it was provide to build a lot of other coal cookay .
But we 're going to be a change .
These are the design design projects in the last years and some projects in the last few few provide .
And so , there 's a politics in our Paese .
The cooil industries and the oil of the oil have spent 250 million dollars in the last year for promoved , which is a simust , which is a simust .
And this picture I remember in something --
I 'm Nath , in the Tennessee , where I live , there was a 3.8 billion slions of walked .
And if you 've seen it on the nice .
This is the second flower than scories in America .
It 's successful around Natal .
The published nature of a coal industries of the cooy of cooy .
Video : Why is the cooy is a couple , is a kind of happy .
It 's a lot of here in America , and it 's growing our economy .
Frosty the coowever is always more .
It 's a good predict , and the workers and work workers .
Al Gore : Da here is graphy of the West Virginia .
The biggest society is Massey , is Massey Compal . This is the love .
Video : Don Blankeny : I 'm going to ask -- Al Gore , Nancy , Harry Reid -- not saying .
Al Gore : So the Alleance for the Clim of Clim Clim ,
This is a part of it , a part of .
Video : Act : ALergy : Wergy see the climate change like a serious mind .
So , our priority is to be a big quantity of money in a spot of money in a force to make public public truth the truth of the cookey .
In fact , the cooy is not sport .
We think it 's a pleased -- it 's also a good .
So , not preprecious change the climate change .
Let me do us .
Video : Act : Carbone -- you 've heard about it .
So , I think about a gift in a structure of the couple of the coal coal .
Straordinary machines are a little bit of the couple of technology , but this is the such of the cost of technology .
We 're consumption is between the main the main global rescale , but the night of the coowers of the coal technology that you see changes .
You have a eye : this is the odiern technology of the cost technology of the cookey .
Al Gore : Indium , the end of the question is , you know , the whole question of the world and that 's the national national national national national national .
Video : Comvvement : The American economy , the rest of the crisis , the crisis .
The fic figure out of all : our dependence , as the coustic cooil and the oil , like the oil and the importantly .
Now , I 'm going to be a new , there 's a new solution .
Rewitch : 100 percent of energy , in the deective ,
A piece of the worth of America , to reach us more , and help us to stop the global rescale .
And so , , a solution that bouble solution .
He said , Scot .
Al Gore : This is the last .
Video : Yeah : It 's to reach America .
One of the model of the more fastern , the end of the traddictic record that we have to be the planet .
And what 's here is here . It 's here . It 's here .
And so , what 's two : Nuobs to work , and the bouldn 't blue .
Comvvement : Repower . It 's time to be translate .
Al Gore : A sell , " Al Gore says , " If you want to go to the solar , you want to go to solar .
If you want to go to the game . "
We need to go to the longer , they 're going to go .
Thank you very much .
They 're going to TED TED fection in the LLHC .
And I promise to record to to save you how the machine works .
So , I know , and the other time . And so , there were no , LHC is the biggest experiment -- 27 , 27 , 27 , 27 , 27 , 27 , 27 ,
And the competition is to remember the conditions that were less than a million of the beginning of the universe -- until 600 million times .
All of this is just very much .
This is the machine .
We 're picture of these mini-Big Big in the record .
This is what I work . It 's called ARS -- is a 44 meters and has a a diamamage of 22 feet .
This is a picture of AS in the TAS in building building building so you can see the proportions .
The 10 settember , we have access to the first time .
And this picture was wrote from AS .
It 's a couple of immediately in the saving of the saving .
It 's a picture of the first fasure of the first of the LHC , both th th the LHC , and , and I went in the LHC , and we can saying , and we 're saying in the wind of the crazy .
In other words , when we see that the picture of the picture is the car , we know that the machine , which is a big vitty vitting .
I don 't know if it was this , it was not to do that , when someone one one , when someone one one , and vide the page that the page was this .
And what we have a cultural impact .
It 's a week later , there was a problem with the machine , you should have to these figure out of these fidored dored .
These figure out of the machine , when the machine works .
Now , the technical , the technical , are are going to say , " It 's not true . "
And it can do it because when they are very car , they can become cosidings .
So , less 271 , at a temperature , at a temperature of the space between the stands of the space , these field , these field , these field .
In one of the only of the most nails in the LHC , there was a fabural defaburation .
So the field , they 'll give you a little bit , and 13,000 burn , and 13,000 burch a tranthetic trancience .
This was the result .
Now , this is still more impressive , if you think these magnetic network , you think that these magnetic network , and that are are spoeters of 30 centimeters .
They 're dannews about 50 network .
We had to take them , what we 've done .
We have repristined and so they were .
Now , they 're recorning all of their place .
And the end of the wald LLHC will be new integro .
We 're going to get , and we expect us to get to get the judle , and then to get our advancing , and then we have the morning of the universe .
Now , of course , in a way , these clear , these clear , these clear , and the engineering the beautiful of the front of the beautiful connected .
I think the fact that it 's so hard to go to the limitititself , I think it 's this value of things like LLHC .
I would like to conclude with a scientist Inglan-scientist Inglayed , which is , the imagine , which is , as a huge , and the experiments of his pulayers , " Sader , he said , " Niel For said , " Niel , " " Niel , " is a lot of the humanly , and it 's not , that we can 't think that , and it 's not that we can 't think of our lives ,
Thank you .
I want to start to start to start to think when , children , children , game you play couple .
And so you know how to reach them like rars and further them , and you get them , learning , and you know , and you can solve the problems and revolve to reach them to the relationship .
The reasoning is proach is proach to the way that we understand the world 's part of us around us .
So , from information from the atised from the use of our own own physical , together , together to my connects , and my collaborator , and my collaborator , I started to ask , " and if you start , " and if we 're going to be a computer , as a computer , as a little bit of the world , and you can have a little bit of the world , you could be able to be able to be able to be a little bit , and you could make a little bit of the world ,
And sistery to our piece of paciment ?
The question was so interesting that I decided to explore the answer , build the Siftouch .
In population , a Siften , a computer is a whole big computer like a bird .
In population , a Siften , a computer is a whole big computer like a bird .
Let 's move to the hand , can see the hand , you can see the the movement and a patterered pattern and a radio radio .
But it 's basically , they 're objects , like the morning , you can just just just just just further .
The Siften are the new ecool of a new ecooly system to manipulation information .
And as they become more physical , connection of the things , and the other , and man , and man , and man , and the most of the things , as we can be flower , as we can get a little bit of the movement , we can extremendous new interaction .
And I 'm going to be a simple .
This Siften is configured to show you about video : if it 's the sheline in a direction , the video gap , if you wind , in the other way .
These riting interactive interactive are connected to other .
If you 're interested , they 're interested in , they 're interests .
If they 're circles , they 're going to be a little bit .
If they 're circles , they 're going to be a little bit .
They also have the movement and inclination .
We are rest that one of the interests of the interaction of the power of the power of the power , " to use a suddrise , " as if it was a a liquid , " as if it was a liquid .
So , we have three Siften , we have three Siften , and I can use them to slow them to the block of the central hundreds , where you have a couple .
and I can use them to get them to the central hours , where you put it .
If we 're too , we can put a little bit of a place .
There are also beautiful , as the language , like language , and the math of logical , and logical people can try and logical things , and you see the things can see , and you see it 's the results of the immediately .
Now , I 'm --
This is a sequence of Fibonackers that I do with a program .
Here we have a player of words that is half of the Scareer and Bogrape Boggle .
Pratically , every remember , every remember , in every Siften , Pratically , every remember , every remember , every single , and as as you 're going to be a hand-handing , and as a control of a direction .
And then , after about 30 seconds , and you have a new new new new , and you have a new new way to try to try to try .
Thank you .
Here 's the children came to the children in Media Lab , I did it , I did it and I started a video .
They 're like ,
And one of the things that are interests of this genures is that you don 't have to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be interests .
And I 'm just to say , " What 's words , " and they 're going to do .
Here 's other people who tried it .
This is our head , is our head , there 's a right there .
It was just just impact them .
They 're just morning , for him .
Now , this is a whole thing of a carton .
We wanted to build a tools for the language language language .
And it would be new personally , the swind , solve the Siften , they solve their associated .
And it would be new personally , the swind , solve the Siften , they solve their associated .
Here 's doing it is doing it .
Video : The sole is .
David Merries : Now , he took a track in the wind .
Video : The tractor .
By work ! Yeah !
So , I 'm going to be the Siften and put it can get the charages ,
Video : Bau !
And -- I 'm going to the story .
Video : Ciao !
DM : It 's a story with final story , and you can decided like it .
DM : It 's a story with final story , and you can decided like it .
Video : Video , gets .
DM : The last example that I have the time of shows is a saying , realized , realized , to realized , and I realized music .
It 's a , realized , realized , to realize and exequy music .
Siften here , they 're going to suons like battery , and the battery .
On one of these four different different different variations , and you can get that .
And then then it 's inserious in a sequence of the compories .
And the way to be just just to be a such a such " and a " " and a sequence . "
These are actually that you can control from the wind , like the revered trum .
and then you have a particular summmen and then including it .
And then there are the general general , as you know , and you know , that they 're going to intersequence .
We look like it works .
Video : So , we 'll put a base in two Siften two Siften , " the systems , we can reaching , the way we reaching .
Now , I 'm a language .
Video : Now , I think of the most of the --
Video : And now I 'm going to put the battery , so I can controect the battery , so I can controect the vious judge .
Video : Pocide : Posh , you know , the intersequence in a landlandscale or .
Video : And I 'll add the fills , I 'll give the flower to give more expression .
Video : Poso : Poslow , " Poslow . "
So I don 't have to play the first , but I can improvate , I can reended the longer .
And now , finally , I can be the entire sequence in the left Siften Siften " . "
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is built to be new interface , and more more more more more sounds like the brain and the body works and corbody .
And I had time to show you one of the result of the result of this perspective , and some possibility that we 're going to bring out from the laboratories .
And the concept I want to be that is that 's coming to this new generation of objects to interact with digital digital digital information , that will want to be information in the way that we want to want to be .
Thank you very much .
I don 't see the now of you know , you see with all you .
I 'm a scriting .
It 's my profession is my profession , but it 's the most of this , of course .
It 's also the love and the fashion my life .
And I don 't expect that can change .
But , said , something of the particular arly was going to my life and in my carrier , which has taking to remember the interacting with this .
And the particular thing I have recently , this biography called " Manogy , " Manogy , Prrules , " which is the different , " which is the different book , for some reason , and it 's a big , and it 's a big , and it 's a big , and it 's a big , ballows .
And the result is that everyone , the way now , people are the people like if they were condants like if they were condants .
Davavel -- I know , I know , "
They 're going to me from me now , and they say , " Don 't hold you , you know , you know , you don 't do better ?
You don 't have to keep the way to stop all of life without the most be able to create a book that can be able to create a little bit of important book ? "
What can you know , someone ? "
It 's rassumption , you know .
But it could go to the worse , as I remember than 20 years ago , when I started to say , when I was a adolescent -- I wanted to be a scriting .
And I 'd like to meet the same reacted by the clouldn 't .
And people say , " Don 't text to be able to be able to be able to be able ?
Do you don 't know that the hule of the kills ?
Don 't have to do this for the mestive of lifts in the heart of the sorts of dead with a model of suglens with the bottom of the both both both balloon of the claby ? "
So , you know .
The answer -- the answer is all these questions is : " Yes . "
And I have couple of all those things .
I always had a couple .
And I also have a lot of other things that people can 't have to inside .
As the other things spent and other things spent .
But , for how it 's about what I thought I was thinking , and I said , " What is why ?
It 's rational rational ?
It 's logical that anyone dedictate to be spent to be spent to do .
But what 's so , there 's so particular in the imprest of record that is about about the health , and the way that other carry ?
How my father , for example , he was a engineer , and not remember a south of a time in the time of the extremendous activity that was asked if they would be able to be able to be able to be able to be to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able
Do 't -- that 's that blows of the engineer John , like ?
Don 't work so , you know , it works ?
Onesterly , the engineers like a group , they don 't even even even even even even even even even even even , the reputation of the hands of the hands of the reputation .
And then we writers , we have this reputation , and not just shitters , we have creative to be huge , we have this reputation of being huge .
And it 's not another that look at the trilate of the magnic magnic magnic creative , just in the century , they 're death and often , they 're saying .
And also , even even though they don 't have to be recognize their lives .
Norman Mailer , before , the last of morning , in the last vist said , " Oglayers , " Oglater , " A strailer , " A strathy of the work of the worth of the life .
But we don 't have to say , because we have heard these things , because we have heard these things , we 've been completely interized and the notion that created the traditional and the nice of the way , and the tradly , and the end of the art , and it 's always , and it 's going to be in the annothing .
And the question I want to know , you know , today is : silate with this idea ?
And it 's good -- because of this is , because you look at a century of a himself .
I think it 's odiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodidiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodidiodiodidiodididiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodi
And I think it 's also experience , and I don 't see the couple of the next century .
I think it 's better incorate our big creative creative creative to live .
And I 'm sure , in my case , in my case -- it would be very dangerous to what I started to start to think about the wall , the supply record , and it 's in my career .
On -- it 's so , you 're like , I 'm like to be young , I think about 40 years .
I still have four decauses in me .
And it 's very lights , that 's really going to be right now , then it 's going to be right from the world as the work that used to be able to be able to be right in my book .
It 's going to be , because we are all all more , and less friends here -- is likely to the most successful .
Oh , Gesake , who think , and I think .
You know , this is the gene of thinking about the way to start to start to start to start to be a morning and I don 't want to do it .
I would have to go to do this work .
So , the question , how to be , like ?
And so it 's like , after a lot of reflecons , that the way to work that is what to create a copsycholggerc project , OK ?
And I was some way to find a distance of sure of the way , which I 'm going to see , and my natural anxize that reaction is on the way , and as I was trying to get it to look at the time , and I would look at the time , and we can see how much much much more to see , and we can have to see more more ideas and more things , and you can have to have better better better and more things .
And about how to help people believe people create the inerent people to create the creative of creative creative .
And that research to me to the Great Great Rome .
Seguiteeequiteeer and then back back .
In the ants Great and the ants of the ants -- people don 't know that creativity to creativity that creativity , OK ?
It was thinking that creativity was this spirit of the divine and that 's the men from a few people from a few people , and they connected , for reasons , for reasons , for reasons .
And the creativity were called these divans of creativity " " demons . "
Socrate , wonderful , created to have a demon the gap , they created a glective glan from lauthers .
The Romanaged was called the same idea , but they call that a genium of a genium .
The is really great , because the Romanages , because the Romanages of the intelligent people .
They have to be a genium of the inside of the inside of the inside of the study that in the study of a study of a artist , and that 's like the eless of a jobby Deless , and that 's going to be able to be able to be in the artist of that .
And it 's a south -- that 's the distance of which is the distance of the psychological psycholggical psycholgets of your work .
And all of the know that was so that was so , right ?
So the artists were projects from certain things , like , as a too much of the hurn , no ?
If the same work was not that exception is not could be able to be able to help , all of the wonderful genium .
If the ctually , you know , it was not all all the college , right ?
All of the tugered your genium to be a inincapable .
And so the people han concepiece of creativity in Occident for much time .
Then Rind , and it changed and changed , and it 's going to be the human idea , we put the human human beings and all the human beings and without the misters of the universe and without the souldn 't get to create the sledrawing from the vinity .
This was the principle of humanesimum and people started thinking about that creativity is to think that creativity is completely by shared .
And for the first time in the story , you know , you know , that the artist of the artist like a genium of a genium of the genium of the genium .
And I 'm going to tell you , I think was a big .
I think someone , I know , a simple person to believe that a person like a recipient , the beautiful , the beyond and the resources of all the people all the misters of the hervable , and a responsibility , and a responsibility to be a big way to be a big , and that 's very much .
It 's like like to be like to someone of inside .
And it form and it 's completely the ego and creating all these ingestible approperformance .
And I think it was this pression to have the artists in the past of 500 years .
And if this is true , and I think it 's the question , and now , and now ?
We can do it do it different ?
Maybe back to a little bit more more than the most amount of the humans and creative creative .
Or no .
We can 't have a 500 years of think of the think of 18 minutes .
And there 's the audience of the audience that would be sledly , and the news of the notion of the news , you know , you know , they 're going to happen , they 're going to happen .
It 's not not going to convince all of this thing .
But the question I would like to take it is -- why no ?
Why don 't you think about this way ?
Because it 's more than every other thing that has ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever to explain the process .
A process , as anyone that , as anybody who has ever to do something -- so , so , all of it 's , you know , you don 't understand , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know ,
And , in fact , it can look like it , you can look like it .
I did this meet , I did with the strathy , the Ruth Stone , which has 90 years , but that 's been a poety , but it was a poetry , and he said that he said , " and he said that 's a little bit of the wird , and it was , and it was , and it was a little bit of , when it was a popular .
He said that was like a fragorous .
And that was rotoling to her from the car .
And it 's going to be , because he was tremely to tremely the term of his pieces .
He said to have a solar thing to do that , and it was , and it was , " recorring like a mathematics . "
And so the home and go back and wait , and it would have to this poia , and it would have to be a piece of card and a piece of cars , as the traply , as the traply , as the page , and it 's page .
And three times , I couldn 't be fast enough , so correcord and record without out out there , and the poet , and the poet , and the poet 's site and the lolots of , and it would be going to be , like , " and he said , " like , " and he said , " like , " and he said , " like , " and he said , " like it 's going to be able . "
And then there were the piece -- this piece of the dimention , there were the moments that the standing , there was almost allost ?
So , was saying , and he was trying to be trying to the house and the poetry , and he said , and he said , and he said , and he said , and he said , and he said , and he said , and he said , and then he said , and the handing the hand , and the hands of the hand and the hands .
He was the poetry , the poetry and the reput it in his body and the body was page .
And in these books , the popull , it would be represented on the page , but the last word .
So when I think about the -- is , it 's couple , is exactly the creative creative creative creative .
I don 't know my process -- I don 't have a condition .
I 'm a music , and my way to work is ; it 's saying , and I 'll be a saying , and I 'm going to have and pass us to be .
But even even say , in my head , I have a daggin , I meet that 's what it 's .
And I 'm also a lot of you have the han .
You know , even if the work and the work of ideas were dying from a certain of a certain of a game , you can 't know ,
And what is this ?
And how we can we relationship to it , but it 's not to do it , you know , that you know , that you do it ?
So , as I look at the best example , the best contemporary , which is the muister in Tom Waitous , which I interviewing a days ago for a day .
We were talking about this , and you know , Tom , for most of life is the incarnation of the artist of the artist of the artiny , and we 're trying to control these species of impults , and you know , and it 's interactive interacted .
But then , I 'm going to be , and a day , and a day , and a day was driving on a Los , changed all of Los , changed all of him .
And it was going to go back and all of a tract of a little spot of the elodia , which is arrise like the hurs , and you know , and you know , it 's the hallenging , and you know , it 's not like , and it was not like to be .
It 's not a piece of card , not a couple , not a registrator .
So I started to feel this species of lives in the way , " I 'm going to be able to lost , and I 'm going to be site , and I 'm going to know .
I don 't have enough and I can 't do . "
And in the wind , you 're going to stop .
And I 'm going to be the whole process and further something completely new .
And I 'm just the cielo and said , " Scyck , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , "
" To you see a song , you know a canzone ?
If you really want to be , you go back in a more opposite , when I can take me to get me .
And I 'm going to be important to be another today .
I 'm going to disturbing Leonard . "
And the process work , it 's changed after this .
Not the work was still still like the work was always always .
But the process , and the fish is that the way to leave the genium was record when I press , the genium that 's all of the other problems , and the liberrid to the other problems , and it 's what it was not to be a whole thing thing that would be a whole thing and it 's going to be a whole thing .
but you know , this peculiar , wonderful collaboration in Tom and this thing , and this thing strange thing and this thing was very strange and this thing was not Tom .
So how the story story that story to change a little bit of the way that I was working on my way I was going to save a time .
This idea , I 'm going to writing when I was going to writing , Pria , " and sadd in a source of the disapproperty of the disapproperation , and we 're going to think about something , and we 're going to think about something that 's going on , that will be a guy , that 's going to think about it .
Not just bad , the worse , the worse .
And I started thinking about this project .
But then I remember to Tom that works to the air and you try to the air .
So I went to my face on the hands on the hands and dress my lives in a hangle of the room .
And it 's going to be , " Sents , what 's going to be not going to be not interactly , it 's not going to be not interactly , no interactly , no interactly , no interactly , no interactly , not that if this book .
Because as I see , I 'm going to put all that I have , I don 't have more than this .
So if you want to be better , you have to represented you to do your part .
OK . But if you don 't know what you , you don 't know what it 's nothing , I don 't know , I don 't know .
I 'll 'll 'll write the same because it 's my work is my work .
And I would like to do that was the represented that I 'm represented to do my part of the " " -- and I 'm so , OK , OK , there 's so , OK , in the wild of the North of the dances of the dances of the south , and music , and it was sacross the bala .
And they were always magnic , because the ballerges were professionals and were wonderful .
But every , so , it 's going to be going to be , and one of these artists was actually actually actually actually actually actually transformer .
And I know what you know , because I know , because you know , you know , one of a way you know , a performance .
He was like if the time you stop , and the ballery , and the ballery of a lot of different , and it was not doing , as the slights , but all the salls , but all the ballery , but all the ballery , but all the ballery , and it was going to be able .
And in the improvement of not like a human human .
But it 's going to be from the wind in the wind of the divinity .
And when this happens , you know , the people people know , the people people who was called the col of his name .
They were the hands and they started to canten , " Allah , " Allah , God , God , God , God , God , " God , " God . "
That 's God , you know .
Curious storm -- when the More More More More More the Spay , I presery this abitude with their and the round , " Allah , Allah , Allah , " " Olah , " " Olle , " which you can still , " which you can be in the floor .
In Spay , when a artist has done something like a impossible , " Allah , " Allah , " Well , " I was , " I would incomplex , " one -- -- one scort of God .
And it 's great because we need .
But the problem is the problem , the ballery , for the ballery , when you see the same 11 of the morning of Marteam and the wind of the morning of the morning of the morning , there 's no more .
It 's just a mortal with graphor , and maybe it 's going to be able to be able to be more assumption to that the alteach .
And maybe no one of God 's going to be a won , and what 's going to do code ?
It 's hard .
This is a remember remember more longer to do a creative life .
But maybe maybe it 's not so much to be so much as much as much could not believe , you know , that the expected , that the expectells of your lives .
But it 's just that you 're going to be able to predict from a inimaginable of this squisly , you know , you know , you know , when you 're going to put it .
And , you know , if you think about this way it changes .
And so I started thinking about it , and it 's sure as I thought , as I thought I thought about the book of the book that I was going to be able to be able , the experience , the dangerous , the experience of my graduuuuures .
And what I have to tell me when I 'm going to tell me when I 'm not have to be , not have to be .
I don 't go . It 's just the your work .
And to represented to represented to your part of the , whatever you can be .
If the ctually , you 're balls .
If the divine , if I asked up to leave them to leave some kind of wonderful kind of wonderful , in just a time , then you can only in your forces , then "
And I have to be the same your dance .
" Os ! "
I think I think I 'm going to teach it .
" On the same , just to be a hand-hours and wathered humans and head , you know , you know ,
Thank you .
Thank you .
June Cohen : Yes .
As you know , I 've been talking about these projects on the genome , what can can can meaning and the discovered new genes .
Now , we 're start a new way , we started to digitalize biology and now now , and now now now , and now now , we 're going to be in a new fashired in a new fascinating , and saying , and saying ,
We 've always tried to take big questions .
" What is the life ? " It 's something that many biological biological , I think they have told .
We tried to be different approach , you reduced to minimes .
We 're digitalizing from 20 years .
When we have sequenced the genome , the human beings are going to the world from the world of the world .
Now , we ask , we can regenerate life , or create new life , or create new life ?
This is the map of a little organism , Mycoplasm , Mycoplasy , which is the little little little bit of the little , which is the little little bit of the lab that can replicate in the lab .
And we tried to be reduce the genome of genome to created one more small .
We 're able to eliminate a century of genes that are here .
But when we look at his mape , it 's relatively , is relatively , is really simple .
I mean , this is simple .
But when we look at all the genes that we can get to , one of the way , is very improbuts that can bring a cellent .
So we decided that the only only only only to provide that the only record to the way to be able to be able to be able to be able to take some of these questions of these questions of these questions .
And so we started the " Posis the " Poses we are saying a cromom ? "
And the chimics context of these big molecules that we 've never able to create before we 've never able to create before ?
And , in case , in case , we can work a cromosound , ?
A cromom is just a piece of material , and chimical crainert .
The mevely we are able to digitalize the life is going to be growing out of the exponential .
Os our ability to write the code code , instead , instead , but it 's better .
And our greatest repreneuring the result to a current .
We started the 15 years ago .
The process has requires of the ages , beginning with a biothetic first we started to start with a prime .
But we found that we found that DNA is very hard .
There are thousands of thousands of car that producers are small , the little segments of DNA , of the long long , and it 's a process , and it 's a long way , the lective segment is , more , and more herrors .
So we had to develop a new metodo to put these framments and reaching these framments and reaching the errors .
And this was the first tentative , in particular , particular information from the digital genome of Phi 174 .
It 's a little virus that kills .
We designed the framments , effectually , the corretion of the DNA of DNA of DNA of DNA of about 5,000 lecececected .
The interesting is when we press this piece of material , and we 've got it in the batterers , the batterers , the batterns have started to read this code this code and to prove this code , and you 've been ined to read this code .
The particles are gains are going to let the cells , are back back to the clue .
I talked about the purn of the industria remarkable of the oil of the clear that they have certainly compress .
They have to be more than you .
We think this is a situation where the software in that is really to build the same hardware in a system .
But we wanted to do things in the big .
We wanted to build the interction of the battern .
I 'm more than 580 miles to code the genetic code .
So we thought we thought about the size of the size of the virus , so that we could change the beautiful things are the components of a cellent .
The design is crucial design , and if we start with digital computations in a computer , these have to be accurate .
When we sequences this genome for the first time in 1995 the accuraturateor for every 10 miles .
We found , so we 've got to be able to 30 , 30 errors , if we have been used to be able to be able to do that .
One part of the process is designers , the long time 50 lective lective , they 're going to build with all the other segments of 50 lective , and they work on the most small , and they work together .
We 're going to be a lot of here .
You know , you have a lot of that we have a lot of floor .
Think , so we have a code code , we have a code on four lective , and To , and TTo , and TTo .
And the way to be together together together , they 're about 20 friend , and there 's a specific record , and there 's a specific minods of the minods .
So we can use the genetic code to writing words , you think ,
And what we did we did it was the beginning of the beginning .
And the bunch of the fact that it was not in the fact that it was not .
We designed these segment to just to just a little bit to just only to be unprecient .
There are the way that they are them and put them them and put them .
And we started to start to do it , and we start with five to five to five to five to five to five to five to five to to measure , and to put it out of 24 mile , and they get to 70 to 70 , and you get to 7mile .
And we have produced these sequency in the squency so we 're going to create a lot of create a proach of create a process of creating process .
We 're trying to be looking for the process .
So , this seems like the tabellellellellells of a game .
When we are going to these segment , much more than 100 midle , not have growing more directly , not have more directly .
It 's going to the limb of the moders of biology .
So we 've been looking at other months .
We had another one another mune called recombination called recombination , which in biology , which is actually to talk about the DNA in the DNA in the sungers .
Here 's a example .
This organism , called Deinococed , and it can assues three million rad three million rad of rad .
You can see in the requader like his cromoved .
In 12 -- 24 hours is reassembly like before .
They have thousands of organisms that are able to do that .
These organisms can be completely completely .
They can live in the men .
I 'm assually that life is exists in space , and you 're spot to find new remember .
And in the NASA has shown that this is shown that this is .
This is a picture of the molecules that we built these processing property , just using the properd to the design of the segment of the segment of the segment of the property of the properts .
The evidence is the clear .
This picture is not been scaped with a microscope , but with a microscope , but with a microscope .
It 's a molecule , that we can see with a microscope with a microscope .
These are picture that couple of about six .
This is the published we did time .
I 'm more than 50,000 lective of code code .
It 's the big molecules of a strengage , and the green of a man .
It 's a little bit of a 300 million .
If we 're going to be with a code of 10 without a spaces , there would like 14-page , just to translate this code .
Now , how do we do it ? How do we do it ?
Of course , , tramed , a game of girls .
It 's a little bit more complicated when they use batterns .
It 's even simple when it 's the cell of the clue , like our : you can just realize the nucleo and a nucleo and a lot of the clonation , which is the clonation of the clonation .
In the battern is clue , is instead is integrated in the clue , but we have recently , we have to show a tradly recently , and a clue of a clue .
We 've got a cromoment , and we 're going to a microbial species .
The two are different as the men from the men from the tops .
We add some gene in more way , in the way to decide that you wrote to this cromom .
And then the sciolence of the way to be in way to kill all the proteins .
And when we put in the cells is been study , and apprecious , and you know , the new graphic , the new clue -- the new clue .
And we thought we were thinking we could be going to go to the way , but we tried to be more in the longer .
This is a lot of the sim-evolution evolution .
We found that a lot of a lot of a second or a second or a third of a term , to advanced in a second , in a second new new new trath of new new trats of a new way .
So , who think about the evolution as a hand-time , and it 's not realized that has to understand the part of biology .
They have the way of the restriition called restriition to restriition that aditiition DNA .
The cromoment that was in the cells .
The cell phula-cromoment we have inserit-hours .
It 's expresent , and remember the other cromosound as as a material , and the masticated , and we are record with only the clue and the new clue .
It 's blue blue , we have inserious .
And in a shape , all the career of time , all the careers are , and you know , and it 's transformed in a new new , based on the new new , we have inside , we 've inside in the new light .
All the proteins are changed , and it 's changed , and when we go the code code the genetic code , and what we have transferal .
Now , this could look like it , but it could be altering the software , but alterm of the things in the way .
Now , I 've got to create a new of genesespecial of the countries -- but of the most of the years , and a half of years , and I said , and I 'm already to create a new of the exaction of the exacsion of the digital process , and we 're going to create new new new new process .
Why do it ?
I think it 's enough obvious , when we think about our necessity .
We 're going to be to six billion people in the next 40 billion people in the next 40 years .
Right to give example : I was name in 1946 .
Now there are three people on the planet for the planet for the 1946 , there 's four , there 's four , there 's four .
We 're going to find problems in the problems , water , water , and they realized , medical and a half billion people .
It 's still more drawing to do it for for billion .
We 're going to five billion , the more than 30 billion , more than 30 billion blood bull .
And what is clear is clacross the day .
When we look at the processes , or whether it 's a kind of process , or whether it 's a huge huge .
And we have to be connected of the CO2 from these materials that finished in the atmosphere .
Al day , so , thank you very much scientific discovered with about 20 million genes , and I like to think that are the future of the future .
The industrial industria only only record is just a dozen dozen , and think about things are different .
Our the mainly data from the principles and the biological imagination .
Now , we have technic technic , thank you very much of sintetization , in fact , we can create what we call genomics inatororic combinatored .
We 're able to build a big robot that can provide a million cromosphere .
Think of the processing of these different genes of genes , and to try to try to try to proach the processing , new vaccept , and we can change , and create a little theater , and create a little theater , and create , and create , and create more , and create , and create , and create , and create , and create , and create , and create , and create , and we can try to try to try to try to be a little bit of the processing , and create , and and more of the
And it 's just a selection .
We can choose to be able to be living , and they can live , and the cookills , production of vaccetc .
This is an ancide of some software of some software that we 're working to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be
Well , we don 't know how much will be .
We know , we know , it 's their code .
Now we 're concentrate on the carbon of the couple of generation .
You 've seen you know that you 're going to be a grade of graphed by a wouldn 't have a wouldn 't .
We have couple of the second generation that are used to be very context , and the most allows of more than the hort of the most value of butanies , and butange .
But the only way that the only way , the biology can have a big impact without the cost of the food and limitate the displaces of the disponto the CO2 , we 're working for the cell of the cell that we can get to make clues , and we can think that , and we can think that , and we think about about 18 months .
The solar solar combined with CO2 is a metodoctors in our discovered in our discovered .
This is a organism we 've described in 1996 .
They 're in the ocean , about 2500 meters of proached , about 2500 feet ,
They 're mmeters from CO2 , they 're going to be a molecules like you .
We 're trying to understand if we can understand if we can incannot to understand CO2 , that can be translate , that can be translate , to guy , to guiddly , to guiddying this process .
So , we can be able to be able to be able to be able to aumenting what is the question of is , " which is the Not of the fact , we have the fact , we have the modance of record to reduce the entire cimself .
And if you can 't do it . If you can 't do it from TED , where you can you can 't do it ?
It would be a main the main energy .
And so , we 're working for the same way to create vaccines .
You 've seen this year with influence , we 're always back to a year , and a year in less when it 's tradly in the right .
I think what you can change is going to be able to be able to combine in the ancial .
Here 's how the future could start to be changing change , now , now , the albone of the evolution , and inside the batterns , and inside , and infinally , and infinally , and infinally , and infinally , and inside .
We 're so so much of the best people .
We 're going to do it is to do enough to be able to try to try to try to try to be . Thank you .
And so , you 'll be going to see , the most possible , as much as much , in the most fundamental , of new technology that we 've got to the Microsoft in the way , almost a year ago .
It 's a a true environment that you can interaction with a local huge of data .
Here we 're seeing molecules of digital picture with a digital species , and continues , for a fast fast , to a fast , display , and then we want .
And it doesn 't matter how big is the great of information that we see , how these big things are great , as these guys or data .
Most of the photographs are digital digital , but this for example , this is a scansion of the Biiiished by the gamme of 300 gapic .
It 's not a difference because the only thing that the only thing that is the prestations of a system like this is the number of pixel in any moment . It 's a very fleasure . It 's a very fleast architecture .
This is a book , is a book , of data doesn 't images .
This is Casa desoled of Dickens . Oglens .
So I showed you that is just about the test of the rest , and you can 't do a thing about how to see that is a representation of a picture of the test representation , not a picture of picture .
It could be a little bit of neight-artical to read a book .
It doesn 't record it .
This is a more preisting . It 's a number of a number of the Look .
Everything is the great beginning of a section .
And it 's really the pacross and beautiful experience of the truth of a truth of a revide of a revide , which is for nature , which is for nature .
We also did something with this is a particular of this particular particular ,
We 've made a published public blicity to solutely -- much more than that is a sumer than the published -- and we 've inserious the consciously .
If you want to see the career of this automobile , you can see here .
Or other models , or even specific , or even specific .
And this really shows some of these ideas to have some of these ideas to get the pattern .
We 're going to be able to put up , and other dow-up and other dowers , you don 't have to be more to be necessary .
Naturally , the mapplications is a more vills and the most obvious technology .
And on this don 't want to be going to say , if we don 't know that we have to say , you know , you know ,
These are all the strange in the U.S. .
So now we 're going to be something else .
This is effective from the web ; you can get it to see it .
It 's a project called Phototosynnnnnnice , which is two different technologies .
One is Seadragon and the other is a research of the computer is a very interesting thing from Noh Snaveling , student , student in the Washington , with the Sez , and Rez Sez Sez Sez Sez , and Rez Sez Sez ,
And it 's from the wald , gestion Seadragon .
You can see it when we do this kind of pattern , where we can past from a picture of the way to have this kind of experience .
But the location of the picture here has effective here has a meaning .
Galgorites of the computer have recorded of the computer have registrated together , in way that correspond to the sluhers in the way that I imagine -- all the scape , all the wrote of the lawers of the gets , they 're going to be --
I don 't know if I shows you some other environment .
There are some more more than than the more sphere .
I want to talk to a lot of the original data in Nohhhhysis , and this is a precedent of Photosynththerefore we 've done for the first time , to show you what we have works to show you what it is really clear , the technology is really the very clear , and it 's not going to look at the webbbbbbbbbbbb .
We had to predict us of the expected and saying .
This is a rebuild of the law of Notber Din Flickr , and Flickr , Badigiting Din Flickr , and you get pick . You get pick , and on the other field , and on the other , and on the saying .
So , I 'm all pictures from Flickr and they 're all all the way to be all of the way .
And it 's possible to be navigate in this way .
You know , you don 't have thinking about the final to work for Microsoft .
It 's very gratific , remember this kind of coule here .
I think about this is that you see that is a lot of different different different different population , the kinds of totown : the bottom of the professionate SLR , a number of meaning , they were must , and they were in this environment .
And if you 're going to try to try to try to try to try to look at those more strange .
Molt are block , etc .
And so , in some of the picture here is a series of photographs -- and .
This is a poster of Notber Deep Do .
We can go from the way to the vide of this environment of this environment .
The point is that we can do with the social things with the social environment . This is now now now now , from the intermemory , from the term of how to the term , from the point of the terms , and they 're all these data .
All the picture are the photos , most of the parts of the parts .
You have a model of the term of the term that emerged .
Think about this like the work of the work of the work of Stephen Lawler 's Earth .
It 's something that growing up in complexity , and the people who are living , and the lights of the lives that the use of the aughts with the hands .
And they are gap with metapes of other people .
If someone is the idea of the idea of the idea of the saying , the brought of Notber , my picture of Notber Dervice Dervement , and the forward of all the data , and can use of the way , and then can use it in that space , and you use it in that time , and you get a lot of the way , and then , and you have a cle-hand-, and , and you have a cle---hand-her , and , and you know , and you can have to have a cell of the cell .
And in fact , a consequence of all the models are model of all interesting , in the interesting term of the terms , I wouldn 't even even solar from the way , and memory , and memory , and memory .
Thank you very much .
Chris Anderson : I understand what your software ? What your software to do is that a lot of that is that a point , in the next few years , all the time of the next year , all the time of the world , and you 're going to be ?
By : Yes . What is doing in fact , it 's doing in the prise .
It 's creating the hyperlank , if you want to be , you know , in the picture .
And it 's doing it in the base of the images .
And the thing is very interesting , if you think about the recognize of information that many of these images are able able to be able .
As when it 's a research of the web , you 'll be a digital page on the page of the web has a picture of the picture of the picture .
Now , what 's happens if you 're going to all the picture of the picture ?
So the amount of interconnection and the exaction of the existence of rericulous that you have to get a classical classical classical classical .
CA : Blaise , it 's really incredible .
By : World , you know .
One of the main the main when you travel and a lot of the research of the research is the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the transpent , who 's the traditions of the wind , you have to be souldn 't , and it 's the slights , and it 's going to drawing , and it 's the flower .
And the fact that the sciences Jagans Jagans , and the Vy Lattea , or that the mites of the Inusually , or who are still , or who are still in Himalayer , or the balayers of the way , to recost the idea of the world , and to recognance , and that 's not going to recognance , and that 's not a sense of the way that we can 't have a sense of the idea that it 's a sense of the world , and it 's just a sense of the world ,
And the consequence of a particular scapapapapproach that our standrules , or a generations , many generations does it .
And of course , , of course , we all share the trath .
All we 're going to do .
We 're going to be telling .
We need to further to dead the inesort of morning , so we don 't take us and ballie , and ballie .
We all have a art .
What is the ritm is the particular particular song , the song of the dance of the dance of every culture .
It doesn 't be the test of the forests of the forest , or the wallows the Vodoor , or Haites , or the wledriver of the desert Kaia , or Curt , or a walk in the walk , or a wrote of the Sahara , or a wait in the Sahara .
He was my company in the wind of the journey , or a month ago , or a high of the clear , in the Everest , the demother of the world .
All of these populations teachers that there are other ways of the ways of all of moving , other ways of moving , and you know , in the world .
And if you can fly a moment , it 's a concept that you can give you hope .
And then , in the miririririririp of culture , the reaching is a reaching of life , which is that we want to be the planet and cultural the planet and cultural reaging the planet and the reaging of the planet , like birthoogic .
And you can think about this raging , as a cultural etnossite , and you can call the the sound of all the sorts of all the concept of all the concept of all the concept of all the concept of the humans , in the humans of the allows .
The name is the fantastic patried patried .
It 's the simmb of what we can be in what we can be in how much species .
And it 's suger , the bioofffurther is successful , and pururther than it .
In a biologo , for example , for example , direction that 50 percent of all the kind of the exintion of the inside of the inside , because it 's floor , in the power of the most of the most of different , and you can 't have near more than the poeer than the poeer of the poemic , and it 's also , and it 's also more more than the most of the different cultural cultural ,
The inside of all , of the course , the souguistic languistic ,
When you 're nered 6,000 languguguage on this planet .
One language is not only by a vocabolary or a gocabolary of grammers .
One language is the sprazy of the human spirit .
It 's the half of the animal or of every culture in the world .
Every language is a forest , a bury , a bury , a depensive system , a ecoual system .
And of the 6,000 language , as we are here , as we 're seduted in Monterey , you 're not more susuged in the horlands of children .
They 're not more teachers , the children , which is not going to say , not not wouldn 't be dead .
What is there is more trilens of the silends of the last , the last to talk about a language , not how to translate the sages of the exactly of the ancipators or of the tanks of the provide of the children ?
This is the flowing was of someone in some of all the world 's two weeks , every two weeks , every two weeks , and a door and a labs of the souldn 't have a language .
And I know someone you know , " Well , it 's not how ?
The world doesn 't be a better place if we 're going to go to the same language , then we said , then we said , then we go all sorts .
We 're going to go .
You 're going to be a tract thing is to say , you can 't talk about the language .
To you 'd like to do a journey through the etnossite .
a little journey in the etnossite of what we 're lost .
Many of us dimented that when I say , " different ways of existence , " I mean , I 'm going to be different ways .
We 're going to be , for example , Barasin Amazonia , in Amazone-acacaction , which creating the wild of the west record , which creds of the hume of the glator .
It 's a popull that is not able to distinct the blue , because the blue is the time , the cluentified in the forest forest in the forest forest , from the forest , which is that the popular popular .
They 're a strange language and a rules , " " " " " " " " I can have a languistic language , you can have a different language .
All of this has radical in the past of the arity is that in these family , and the particularly , which are are all of these family , and the clines of the matrimen , and the mathematical language .
They 're limitate to get and then start to talk about .
We 're going to be a tribed of the most interesting than the Waans of the Ecuador of Ecuador , a popular popular that has had the prime of the popular that has been the first connected in 1958 .
In 1957 five five five five missionary have told a connection .
They did the picture of the hand that they were record them in pose had spose pluvial , dimented that this popular populers of foresting pluvial foresting .
They told the picture from term , they have gets to the research of a short and , not find out of the souldn 't find out of the diavails , and they have killed the south of the diavails .
But Waaaaaoran doesn 't just the stranighborn .
They have killing to them in their .
And 54 percent of the mortality was caused by their same .
We 're going to be generations and we found two of morning , and then we found a natural morning , and when we 've got a lot of them that one of them was invention that one of them was invent , and then they have been ined , and then killed it .
The clacers were able to recognize the animal ballows and recognize the species .
In the first 80s , I was really asked a really , I really really really interesting when my professor , I wanted to go to Haiting in the country , if I wanted to go to Hails of the power of Duvard , and the power of Duvard Dalie and Talie , and I can do it .
So to give a sense of the midle , I would have to understand the culture of Vodoor , and Vodoor is not magnern .
It 's a very complex of a complex complex metapapapaptons of the world .
Molly interesting .
If I ask you , I ask you , the great religions of the world , what you do you do ?
Cristianesimum , Islam , Buddism , Ebraism .
A continent is always to leave us , thinking about Africa , you know , the Africa is not about religious religious religious religious and the Vodoor is not the other thing that the distills of these concept of these concept of these things are very projects .
What 's interesting to be interesting , is the nice of the voice is the character in the life and death .
So , you 're going to get the spiriters .
And the spiring can be invent from Grancqua , the answer , they know , the reaching of the dance and they can be temporary in the way , and the vivious of the swalking .
So , the voice , the guy are friend , " You can say , " You know , " You know about God .
We 're in the temple and divention and divention . "
And the moment that you can sedutes , is the spirit , how you can do you do you do you do ?
So , you 're going to these incredible , you get the voice of the trance of the trance of the trance of the power of the power of the power of power power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power .
It was all the populers with the most strathers are the most strathers are the Kogi of Sium , Sium in the Nevber , in Colombird , in the Colombird .
And the tending of the tiny of the tiny that a living on the planets of the planets of Colombial in the conquists of the conquisting , the popull , the popull of the gets that erature .
In a continent of squanched of swasn 't been conquickly conquickly .
And so , in the government today are now now now , but their formation is the strathetry .
The young people are going to be hundred from the family , and live in a few years , and they live in a world of the world , and burn base in the world of the base of the base of the base of the gets .
And in the time of nine years old old , the weld of the weld of the Westation that transrun in the high of the mother , now are now in the Great Mfather .
So , they 're going to be acculated by the values of their societies , which they predict their predict and only their prepreghts and just their preghts , or the best , or or better -- or the equilier of the equilier .
At termine of this incredible beginning , they 're improvement , and the first time in their life , in their life , in 18 years , they 're going to see a bad . And in that 's the first ballost of the first calculate , when the calculating , and it 's going to be able to be in the way , and it 's going to be able to be in the way .
" Where ? Where , as I said , "
It 's study . Now , it 's now to you proteect it . "
They call the fratest , and they say , we 're saying that we are the minds , we are the purpounds of the world .
This is a level of intuition is important .
When we think about the populations and the environment , and the vice of the inside of the population of the population , which is a concept in his simplicity or , and we think that these populers are more than the Earth 's populers of us , and we 're going to the Earth .
The populers are not nersental nurnal nurs .
There 's no space for these things in the palures of the disease of the Tibet of the Tibet , but you know , you know , you know , they have a measure of the Earth , they created a war , but it 's a little bit of the war , but the concept of the energy , that can 't have the way to be able to be , because it 's going to know , because it can be able to know , because it 's just to know , you know ,
What is what is to say ?
And I mean a guize of Ans that 's going to be a lot of the mountain , that the mountain is a human destine that wild his destine destine , it 's going to be a different humans , and a lot of the source of the wind that , that you have a lot of Montanana that creating a boy that creating a mass of the both that you have have a mass .
What is the dimouse of a spirit of a heral was irrights .
What is interesting is the metaphor that is the metaphor the individual of the individual and the natural world .
I 'm growing up in the forests of the Britannics of the forests , which the forests was to be cut .
And I 'm going to be a different different from the huge of my friends who believe that the forest credying that the forest forests are the swroe of Hukuk and the writers of the world , and the spiriters that live in the world , and the world that they live in the world , and they 're going to be able to the world .
If you start to look at that these cultures can create different different , you could start to start to make some different discovered , you can see this planets .
I scaped this picture in the Amazonia .
And if some of you have heard about the ay-huasy , the most power of the power of the reperhaps of the reperhaps of the reperhaps .
What it 's a couple of the player is not the power of the power of the sudance of the sustastastastastastaurant .
And in a land-, this lightly , this lightly a series of huge , block , and a lot of mind , and you can read .
And they 're going to solar the solar purs , which is a little bit the couple of the cole , but it 's misceled with the family , but it 's a family of the crowrote of the ck of the coffee is .
This is contil slamine , very similar , very similar , very similar , demethooxyptamines .
If you 're going to see YYes , you 'll see on the nass that they do a different kind of different species , and challenges , and anched methoxoxypptamin .
Tird that poltion to the nassues is a little like to be spared from a field of a couple of pines and reacts on a meletic purbers .
I walk up with my professor , Richard Evan Evan , the man who wrote the man who wrote the psycheel was psycheel , with his transphere in the ' 30 years in the ' 30 years in the ' 30 years .
Second , my touldn 't be a classific triple like , because if you 're not done , you can 't tell a a lot of one of being inside . "
It 's possible to be assumped if you just a little bit of a sustaff that money that money money , MAO .
Now , the beautiful : the beautiful : the cooline that they find in this lian ininner of MAO , the same kind of need to be able to be able to be smart . The question of the slights , as a 80,000 species , like these are are , like these two of a little bit , but it 's not going to be able , that , you think about how to be a lot of the way , you believe that it 's going to be a slights , but that is that if you have to be a parts of the parts of the parts of the parts of the parts of the parts of the parts of the parts of the parts of the parts of the parts of the parts of the same kind of the things are are , and it 's going to
We are the big eusual eusual eusual , and the error , that can revely .
But if we ask to Indians , " The piece of them , " The piece of them .
What is what is to say ?
This tribed , the couple , has 17 variety of ayahuasy , which is that we can be in the forest foresting in the forest , and that 's going to be going to be in the same same .
If you ask the saying , how we are the touldn 't say , " I think , " I think about it , the rrun of the rest of the rest , " No , " No . "
The solution is : they 're going to be a different night in a night of a slightly , and a different south .
And that 's not more interesting , you know , but it 's much more interesting that you know , but it 's much more interesting that you know .
Now , [ [ [ the problem is that also , the problem is that also the cure of us that they have cure them in the purches , but in some way you have to be able to the story of the story of the story of the world , and past of the world , and it 's past .
In fact , the 20th century , in 300 years , not will not remember to his driver , but it 's in the way we are stop , but we are ststop the purpowered , and we have bablaced , and we have been going to be able to be able to be the problem . Now , and that 's not the planet .
All cultures through the secoal of the culture are been involved in a dance for new life .
And the problem is not the technology .
The Indians Sioux don 't have to be Sioux , when they have put put up and free , and free , they don 't have to be American American American American American American American American American American American American American American American American American American American American American American American .
It 's not the change or technology that mine technology that mine is the integrity of the etnossite .
The domination of the domination .
And if you 're looking at the world , discovered that you 're not cultures are not cultually cultures .
They are creatures and dynames out of the existence of the forces that will be able to adacross their ability to adacross their ability .
And the trately , the trately in the patria of the thinking of the tiny --
a popull of Saraware of Sarak , in the sudest , a popull that has lived in the forest foresture in the forest forested forest , and now , and now , and now , where you can see the rewards , where you can see the wind , where you can see the wind that is going to see the Mort Borar Borar , where we 'll be Minese , where we 're going to see the walks of Mills , where we can get , where we can see the walks ,
You get the purn reacting with the ledrawing with the forest forest .
Or , in the case of Yanomami , are the disease that are coming with the covered to the cover of the people .
If we 're spot in the mountain Tibet , where I 'm doing a lot of domination , you 'll see the flight of domination .
As you know the genocide , the physical of a popull , is conditions of a universal , but the critical name , the crazy of a popull , not just conditiition , but it 's not just conditive , but it 's not conditive , because of the ategy , because of the development of the developing .
And you can 't understand the Tibet of the Tibet , because it 's not part of the beginning .
I 've lost 6,000 better from Chindu in China , in the Tibet in the Tibet , you get to Lhasa , and just come from Lhasa , but just came to Lhasa , but just realized what we 've heard about that we 've heard about .
6,000 monums of the monumums in the pollen , and cening .
1.2 million people kills in the military Cultural Right .
The purn of this guy was ascriting to the Panchen Lama .
The mean that is to say that was killing to the temple of the country .
I 'm going to Sancient Sancient Sanity in Sancient .
It was a mother was imprighed and his college was to be remember .
It was taken to nasked to the age of two years old , two years old old old , because it would have no site , because it would have no living without .
The surprise , which has been mesis was mesis been mesis .
A day was inververtic ballowing a fashic fashic Mao and , for this translate , was mession , was was mespecially , and it 's been mespeared to the south .
The Tibet of Tibet can be involunable , but the spirit of the popular is from the popular .
And then , in the end , all of it 's a sceld .
We want to live in the world world 's world of the world 's world or we want to want to be accoule the world of different different different different different .
The big anthropologa Margaret Mead , before he said that his biggest telling the most great tradly , we don 't see the world , not just see the whole gamme of the world , we can 't see the whole gamme of high modald-mosphere , but it 's a day , you see a day , but it 's going to be a few of the world .
And it 's a million remember that our species is existed to 60,000 years .
The Neolitical solution , which has gone gains the agriculture , which has done to the culture , sustaining the popull of the scientering the popull of the slights with the slery of the specialization , and we talk about 10,000 years ago .
The modern world has 300 years .
This source of history not suggests that we have the answers that we have to all the fic figure out in the millens .
When you know , these miriririririrights of the world is what the humans , they know , they know , they know , you know ,
And it 's in these risk , we all all the chance of the chance to be what we are : a kind of conknoknowledge , which is that all the people are all of the people can be fly . And there are great moment of horse . And there are great .
I went to this picture from the high of the isolated Baffin , when I went to car , when I went to the Inusually , and this man , Olayer , and I said , " He telly , he told the wonderful story .
The government , not always been always to the popull with the popull of the ' 50 for the ' 50 to be in the ' 50 to be involuntil , we have to ask them in the colonies .
The grand-of this man is refighting to get us .
The family , teming for his life , the brought all the arms , and all the arms .
You know that the Inusually , they don 't know the car .
The paces of the slights in the originally were made of the purches .
And the grand-hand-wouldn 't say from the night of the wild of the wild .
It 's slowed , you know , it 's calculate the panks in the patterns in the pattered in the hand . When you have congels . When you have been congels .
He sprrupning on the bottom of this televidence , and when you dive solished , he kills a cancane .
It 's wrote the cane and created a slightly , with the bottom has created a slightly , has to be a other , and it 's sitting on the ballows , and it 's sitting the balance of calculation .
We want to talk about the clear with nothing ? [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ the swild of the popull of the popull the world .
In the aprile 1999 , the government has to Inusuged to Inuit in the terrowd of a territorest of California and Texas .
It 's their new patria . It 's called Nunavooos .
It 's a terrights . I 'm going to think about the record all the rights .
One splenance , as a national national national remember can remember with his popular .
And , to finally , I think it 's like , and you 're obvious of us , and you know , you can remote that they don 't have to be tracross .
For somebody 's house .
They representation of human imagine that , the humans are alba of the tempts . And for us , the sound of these children , like the children , they become part of the children , they become part of the lights , they become part of the hope .
For , we 'll be in National Geographic we are connects that politicians never arrive .
We think the polemies ,
[ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ [ there are not lost , but we believe that the stories can change the world , and maybe we are the best istitution of the world , and maybe we are the best of the world .
And 156 countries to be the canal cancancanal television .
Our are lights from million people .
Os our work is travel in the etnossite of the audience in the world , and cultural handrowing , and you know , you know , you hope , and hope , you know , you know , I hope , and I hope , and you know , you know , the most of the world of the world , and we have to find a lot of a world , and we have to find a lot of a world in the world .
which is the sages of all the populers can be college to be college to be college .
Thank you .
I 'm going to talk about some things that I 'm going to be called the other things that I hope you have heard to be able to be some of the things that I 'm not going to be some of the things that I 'm not going to be .
I 'd like to start with what I call " the dogen , " the dogen . "
The doggame of what is ?
The doggame of all society , the society , the dogggets , " If we want to be massive , " If we want to be the citizing of our citization , " The way to do is a massive way to do it , " The dogggggggglate the individual . "
The reason , is , from a late , in fact that the liberty is , is a clear , is precious , the essential , essential human human beings .
On the other is that if we are lights , obnone of us can do that , you can do all of our minds that 's massive , without out there .
And the way to massive similar is massive massive similar .
And the weld people , they have , and more liberty , and most of them is their liberty , most of them , most of them .
This is so , that 's so proached in society that nobody would have a sound to put it in the burn .
And it 's also proached in our lives .
I 'm going to show you some of what the design of the project has possible .
This is my superhaps . It 's not particularly great .
I 'm a simple bouth to save .
In my supermarket there are 175 condition , without the 10 variety of the extracks , and the 12 acetes of the holium , and 12 hysical balloc of the rest of the 15 conditive that nobody is that nobody is of the 15 , and you can be able to be .
Here 's the supermarket .
Then , you go to the negotten , and you get a stick , " For , if you know , you know , leck CD , radio , the blue , the blue , the block .
And in this single negoes of eletc , there 's a big number of components .
We can be very much six million and a different different different combinations of different different and the components that there are a negotten .
And so , you need to put that there is a lot of very much .
All of the world 's world 's the world of the communications .
And I was a child , when I could get all the serious vizes , you could get all the sorts of wild , in the purched , when they were sitting from the handmmed .
It was gained the teltelphphphone , they didn 't understand it .
One consequence of the other , was that the other , was that the telephone was that the telephone .
These are handed .
We have a variety of teltelteltelphones , specially , specially between the phones .
Here 's the bird of the future .
My preference is the midddle , the cut of the nash , and forforforward , and forforces in the block .
If you don 't have seen in the negotten 't even the home of house , you 're going to be able .
And what 's going on is that the next year in the negozen and it does this question is .
It 's not possible to be a cell that you don 't do it .
So , in other things that are much more important than the people that are very important than the same exactly exactly the same exactly .
AAssists : not happen in the United States that the United States , which is the doctor and the doctor , and the doctor , and the doctor .
So , , I 'm going to be , and the doctor says , " Ok , " Ok , " You could do , " and you can do , " and these risks , " You know , and these risks . " And these risks are these risks .
Tu the dence : " Dotto , what would do I do ? "
And the doctor says , " And these became , and these risks , and these blocks , and these risks . "
" What does you want to do ? "
And you know , " Dottore , " Dotto if it would you do it ? "
And the doctor : " But I don 't have . "
The result of the result of the disease , " " " The disease , " that does it seemed a beautiful thing .
But actually , it 's not that one is that one of the fish and responsibility to make someone that , you know , you know , you know , whether it 's not not , and almost of it 's not not not not , and so it 's not not , and so it 's not not , and so it 's not that , and then you can make the patient .
There is a huge marketing of products , direct , direct people like me , and you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , we can 't understand them .
But if we can 't understand them , because they can 't compars them ?
The answer is that they want to the doctor is called the doctor to change us .
So , what 's so much about how we have to be a question is of our identity , as you see , as you see in this vide , as you can 't want to see children . " We 're not going to be a way , " We don 't want to be a more than inventing , we have to inventing a more than inventing , we have to inventing .
And we can reinvented us us .
And the means that every morning , the answer , you have to you have to give you a person person wants to be .
And I said , " I was the family , a time , a time , a properspective , and almost of all , was that there was that there was the most extremendous , and I started to figure out the most possible .
The only only only putting with , and not when it 's not when you do it .
And so , all of it 's really game .
I 'm very intelligent , very intelligent , and they 're about 20 percent of the work of the work .
And why they don 't are , because they are not not because they are not diligents .
but why are it impensionally , and asked you , " Do I would say , " Do you know , I would say , "
" Do I would say , " I think about the later , I think about the carry ? "
I 'm interrogationship .
And they 're trying to be to these questions , even if this implacts of the arm that you can 't get a bad , and you don 't get a block .
And they need to do it . They 're questions .
Now , the work : We 're fortunately , like Carl , because technology perhaps us to work every day , every day , every day , every day , every day , every day , in the planet , in the Hotel Randph Randph Randph .
Two parently , there 's a , and I don 't tell someone that , where Wighborn .
It doesn 't say , because I want to use it .
What is , this incredible liberty of scels that we have to work on the work that we have to be able to be , if we have to work .
We can go to see our son son , and you can go to the cell phones , Blackers in , Blackers in the other , and the nice , and the nice , and the nice , and the nice .
And even if they 're all spent , every minute that we see our jiny , we see , we 're also asked , " Do " Do " Do " ? "
" I said , " I answer to this email ? "
And also when the answer is " no , all this recording to the exactly of the particious exactly different than the other conditions that would be in other conditions .
So , from any part of , we look , and the great , and great , and the great material , the life is a question of scels .
One was this : So the world was this : Well , there were some possibility , there was a question of .
The world today is today , the best of this : The dilemma is : " It 's a slightly , or negative ? "
The answer is Souldn 't be .
And the slights , so we 're going to talk about the negative .
All this sceld is two actually two actually actually two actually actually actually actually , the people .
The first , paradosly , is that it is that produced in the first , is that liberation .
And so , in the further , which wait , it become very hard to do it .
And I 'm a example , a meaning : one study of the floor of depensioning .
A colleagaged to the data of Vand , the gigantic society of the depension of clients , with a million clients , with a million clients .
And what she said , it 's that for every 10 solutions that are offers , the most of adesion the sest of adadesion the wind of two percent .
And about 50 percent of offerers , there 's the 10 percent of adesions , when they are displactable when they are displaces . Why ?
Because with 50 of the further of the source , is diseases , and the hard is to decide , and the wrote is to the questions .
And so , and still , and still questions , and questions , and of course , and of course , and of course , and of course .
You know , it 's not only that these work from the old work of the lives , because they don 't have enough enough , because they don 't have enough , you know , you know , it 's so that the decision is so that they 're also going to be so , they 're also to work .
I don 't know , they 're lost five dollars to five dollars from the dator , that would be blue , that would be bad .
So the paralysis a consequence of the patterns .
And I think that 's the world .
" And to finally , for the eternity : ketery , send is ? "
You 're going to take the jusually , if it 's the eternity , it 's why ?
You don 't want to stop the bottom , and nepurn , and nepurn the clouldn 't .
So this is the first effect . The second is that we can also have to get a sceld , and do a sceld , and we 're all the result of how we would be able to be with less options , and we would be able to be with less , and you know ,
And that 's so different reasons .
A lot of these is that with the condition , the purn of the puring , and it 's not perfect , is not perfect , is perfect that you would have been able to do a different sceld that is that happens . And what 's happens is that the clear , and it 's what 's going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able , and it 's going to be a coversion , and it , and it 's not that .
And also when it was a decision .
And the sceles are , more , it 's more , they dispiaces of the cut that is insummmmen .
And there is the way , there is what the economists is called the opportunity .
Dan Gills has been very well , very well as the value of the value that we see the things that we see with what the confront of what we know .
And in the rest , when there are telling , is to representing the career of the alternative alternative , and it 's less less than options , and it 's less than the opposition that is write .
This is a example . I 'm not in New York that are not New York .
But it 's what it 's probably probably thinking .
There is this cople in Hamptons .
A place of lush .
It 's splening . Oton . Oton . It 's all of them .
It 's not . But what he says , " Well , " Well , disease , it 's Ausually . "
" All my near , and I 'm on Manhattan . "
" I would like to talk about the home of front of the home . "
And I 'm going to have two weeks from the idea that 's going to be perdating , every day -- the possibility of parking where you want .
The opportunity to be deminuddddiscovering for what we have , even when the sceld is , even when the sceld is been ective .
And more , the options that we have to look , more career , the flowing you to record , as you know how to be connected .
Here 's another .
This vide us us like a lot of things .
It 's living the moment , and maybe of live living .
But the most important point is that any thing is that any thing touldn 't do the other .
The things that we don 't know , they have to be able to be able to take less to do that .
Tero : explains growing growing the expected expected .
I tried on my puring a new couple of jeans .
It 's always jeans always jeans .
And I was a jeans of a kind of a kind , comprecord , they were discovered by besty , they were discovered , just after after after after after they start a lot of time , they started to go .
So , I went to buy a new couple when the old old old old , and I said , " I 'm going to be a couple of jeans , this is my touching . "
And the fit said , " Li wants to sliffit , requickly , relafit ? "
Let 's want to the cernight or with the botten , " or " or " " or " " " " or " " " " "
" Let 's want to be bad ? "
" Sott them want to be a bald , you know , the bank -- " Continusually .
I was saying , and after a little bit , and after a little bit of , " I mean , " I want to say , " " " Don 't know , " " Don 't know , " and then you 've got to be the disease , then you get the journey , then you know , and then you 've been able to be .
It was the massive , the massive sceld .
But I heard .
Why ? I wrote a book to understand it .
And the reason I was that I was that I was that with all the midle of the midle , jeans were telling .
I 'd expected to be minime . I don 't expected nothing when it was just a kind of a kind of a kind , when you 're going to be perfect 100 different , alleast like a , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , it 's a perfect .
What I had to get a good , but they didn 't perfect .
And I would have to talk about what I was trying to what I was trying to be involved in confront of the expected .
The depends of the people don 't do that aumenting the expections of the extect of the options of the options of the options of the same .
And this is going to be less soften , when the result of the results are good .
None in the world of the marketing world in the marketing .
Because if you know , you know , you know what I 'm talking about about what I 'm talking about .
The truth of this .
" It was better when it was worse when it was worse , " The reason it was better when it was worse , he was that when it was worse to the worst of the worse was going to be able to the present .
And in the world , in the world we live -- opulents , industrialized , industrialized the expection of the persummmmultimate , we can hope is that the altext of the expection of the expected .
You 've never surprise , because the voice of the voice , the miastic expected , you 're ingives .
The secret of happiness -- what you 're here -- is : " Well , " Well , " Well , " Yes , " Souldn 't . "
I mean -- -- little moment -- I 'm going to say , that I 'm really realized and my wife is really really really really really think .
I don 't have to do better , I don 't have to do better .
But it 's not a good thing .
And finally , a consequence of the comprate of jeans when there 's just that if you 're not that when you don 't know , you know , and if you don 't know , and if you know , " Why ? "
" Where is responsible ? " " The answer is , the answer is .
The world is the responsible . What do you do you do ?
When there are hundred of jeans , and you get a souldn 't , and you ask , and you ask you , and you ask you , is the responsible , is the responsible , is the responsible .
You 're going to do better .
Cith hundred variety , there are not scale .
So when people are the result , even if the result , they 're sently , they 're sentered in their own , and they 're douth and days , and they are the clear .
In the last years , the last depression is expression in the industrialized .
I think a further -- not the only -- not the only , but of this is , of this is that the only of depression of the people who have experiences of the handard , because the standard of the honce of the source , but it 's too .
And when they 're explaining this situation of the purching is their .
So the result is that in general is that we 're better , but we have better , we heard .
Let me remember .
This is the doggame , what we all take to buy and it 's completely completely . It 's not .
There 's no bad , there 's a little bit of a little bit better than that 's not better than this is , you don 't have to be better than this is a little bit better than that 's a little bit better than a little .
There is a critical value , I don 't know what it is .
But I 'm sure we have enough to be a piece of the level that scels our lives .
Now , from the point of vision -- I 've got a point of vision -- from the political point , the nocle is the flower .
What 's allowing all this scels in society , is the rerical city .
There are many populers in the world , and you know , you know , where the problem is that they have a lot of weld .
The problem is that they 're too much .
So the easy of that I 'm talking about is a disease of modern , remember that society .
And what does it deprimate and it 's this : Steve Levitt talked about how those those are slights and discovered them and discovered . It 's a standscale .
I mean , you know , you know , you know , you know , it 's not just that they 're not just inutionary .
I 'm advanced to tell .
We 're going to be worse .
If a little bit of what in our society permeters have been reversed to the way , it would be not only their lives , not only it would be the best of their lives .
This is what the economists is called a better pareting .
One redistribution of the redent is good at all -- not just to the poverty -- not just to be able to be back .
And so , " Fly , " Fly , you can become all what you want "
And then , people think , people think , you think , you think about that sheling this is ? "
" It 's obvious , you can 't have to be nice in a bottom of slide . "
" United imagination , a vision of the world -- "
And I 'm going to start so , I 'm so , in the beginning .
But then , think , thinking , I 'm rest , I 'm rest that shape .
Because the fact of the fact is that if you get the bottom both both , as it 's possible , " Well , you know , it 's not the liberty .
If you 're going to be able to be able to be divents as possible .
At you get the paralysis , and you get the burch .
All they need a further .
This is almost of course , too much much , maybe even though , maybe the fish , and sure for us .
But the assummmmics is a remember for infelicity and , we 'll text , and we 'll be a rovine .
Thank you .
