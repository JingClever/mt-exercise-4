I showed these slides to show that the slides to show that the artical calots , which for almost three million years had the size of the 48 million years had the United States continental , it 's refted 40 percent .
But this underneath this underneath the problem because it doesn 't show the ice spring the ice .
The glacial calots is , in a way , the clever of the global climate system .
You can expand winter reach .
The next slide is a quickly carler on the last 25 years .
The ice lost are reached in red .
You see , they blee up to the blue ber .
That 's the ice in the winter , which is the inside .
You can see that the ice ice ice ice , and five years , or more , is like five years or more , is like the blood , which is like the blood here .
In 25 years , it 's been like this .
This is a problem because the warming interest in the ocean land , around the ocean on the ocean , where there are enormous coal quantities of coal congeled that , skied , they 're transformed in meters .
I 'm respect to the totality of global atmosphere , that quantity could double global warming , superate this point of not the return .
In some holding hongs , in Alaska metane hundred himself from water .
The Katey Walter of Alaska University of Alaska , the University of Alaska team , with a lake , the winter .
Video : Wow ! Al Gore : You 're good .
A reason is that this termal examples of Greenland from the northern .
This is a glacial river .
The downnered hasn 't reached levels .
This is the Kangerlusaq , in the Souast West Greenland .
If you want to know how the level of the sea level of the ice , on the sea level , here is where you get to the sea .
These corrings are increasing quickly .
At the other side of the planet : Antarctarm of ice the planet .
The last month last month have clear , the scientists have clear that the ice of the ice , and the Antarctarctica , which pogets on some islands , which is particularly fasts in some isoles .
Equital at six feet of the handle of the active level in Greenland .
Himalayas , the third biggest block , you see new laghi , which few years ago were glaghi , which few years ago were glacier .
40 percent of the world population would receive water , by the one of the slide .
Sulle Ande : this glacier is the source of the city of this city .
The down-increase .
But when it decreases , the same happens to be on the powerful water .
In California the snow on the Sierra Nevada is 40 percent .
The hyoung is in crisis .
The predictions , as you read , they are fold .
The growing growing section in the world 's cleaning to a remarkable car .
The environmental disaster are increasing a rhythm out of the normal and precedented .
Four times more number of times in the last 30 years , I would have to previous 75 .
This is a whole thing about all insustainable .
If you look at it in the historic consequences .
In the last five years , we 've added 70 million tons of CO2 every 24 hours -- 25 million tons in the ocean every day .
Look attention the East area of Pacific , the Americas , to the Americas , in the west , and on both the parts of Indian , where there 's a poor oxygen in the ocean .
The largest causes of global warming , together to deforestation , which is 20 percent of us , is the use of fuel use .
Oil is a problem , and coal is even worse .
The United States is one of the two countries with China .
And it was proposed to build a lot of coal other central coal .
But we 're seeing a change of direction .
These are the annoullated projects in the last few years and some of alternative proposes .
And at every way , there 's a politics in our country .
The coal industries and oil have spent 250 million dollars in the last year for promoting coal , which is a bluean .
And this picture of this image --
I 'm werve Christmas , in Tennessee , where there was a 3.8 billion gallons of coal glass .
Maybe you saw it on the news .
This is the second largest flow of scories in America .
It happened around Christmas .
The nature of coal publishing of coal industries was this .
Video : Frosty : â™« Frosty the carbon , it 's a happy and happy .
It 's abundant here in America , and it growing our economy .
Frosty carbon is more and more published .
It 's good , adorable , and the workers and workers maintained the stypppath .
Al Gore : From here is a lot of the West Virginia .
The biggest minerary society is Massey Coal . This is his administrator .
Video : Don Blankenship : : I 'll be clear -- Al Gore , Nancy Pelosi , Harry Reid -- they don 't know what they 're talking about .
Al Gore : So the Alliance for the Clima Proteition of Clima has launched two campaign .
This is one of them , one part .
Video : Actor : All COLergy , we see climate change as a threat to our business .
So our priority is investing a great money in a effort of money in a effort publishing and confused the truth to fix and confused the truth .
In fact , coal is not sports .
We think it 's clean -- it 's also a good , we can .
So not preokay climate change .
Let me do it .
Video : Carbone : Carbone , you heard about it .
So let 's take a turn in a structure at the clean , for how much coal about the clean .
Straordinary ! The machines are a little noism , but that 's the sound of the clean technology .
The coal consumption is between mamain global warming , but the remarkable technology , but the night technology of the clean that you see changes everything .
You look at a look . This is the hodiernal technology .
Al Gore : Finally , the positive alternative connected to economic economic question and national security .
Video : Comvast : America is in the crisis ; the national security security ,
The file that all of them : our dependence on fossil fuel , like the sport coal and oil .
Now , there 's a new car , it 's a new car ,
Repower America : 100 percent clean energy , in 10 years .
A plan to put America to work , make sure , make sure you get more secure , and help global warming .
Finally , a solution that you were to solve our problems .
America .
Al Gore : This is the last last .
Video : Comvance : It 's about rewaring energy to America .
One of the fastest ways to get to the dependence on the dependence of combustic combustic .
What it 's here . Sun , the future is here . Sun , a new web energy .
What it 's two : two : Novi investment for burn jobs .
Comment : Repower America . It 's time to be realistic .
Al Gore : A vast African proverbial African says , " If you want to go fast .
If you want to go away , you go together . "
We have to go far away , quickly .
Thank you very much .
Last year at TED I did an introduction in LHC .
And I promise to reach you about how the machine works .
So here I am . And for those that time there were no LHC , the LHC is the largest scientific experiment ever tried -- 27 miles of circuit .
His task is to remember the conditions that were less than a billion second of the beginning of the universe -- to 600 million times a second .
And all of this is just environtious .
This is the machine under Ginevra .
We were photographs these mini-Bang inside the relevators .
This is what I work . It 's called ATLATLATLAS -- is 44 feet and has a diameter of 22 meters .
This is a spectacular picture of ATLATLATLAS in construction so you can see the proportions .
Ten September year we have access the machine for the first time .
And this picture was taken by ATLAS .
It was causes immense in the control room .
It 's a picture of the first of particles that had done all the LHC , entering collision , by collision , of iberately , with a part of the LHC , and spreading particles in the relator .
In other words , when we saw that image 10 10 to the september 10 , we figure out that the machine worked , which is a great victory .
I don 't know if this was this to be exultent more or this , when somebody went on Google and saw that the initial page was this .
That means we 've had a cultural impact on the beyond the scientific .
It was a week later , there was a problem with the machine , it had to these dorn dored here -- these dored dorn fierds .
These files take 13,000 printing when the machine works at the power of power .
Now , the technicians between you will look at the files and say , " It 's not true . They 're too much . "
And they can do that because when they 're very cold slies are very cold slies .
So , at less 271 degrees , at a un-inferior at the inference of the space between the stars , these files can bring that corrate .
In one of the younger of the most novemiss in the LHC , there was a defect of fabbrication .
So the files are about slightly , and the 13,000 print , and 13,000 print electrical resistance .
This was the result .
Now , this is even more impressive if you think that these magnets more than 20 tons , and that have moved about 30 centimeters .
They are saying about 50 magnetic .
We had to take them , what we had to do .
We 've got them and adusted them .
Now they 're back to their place .
And the end of the brand , the end of the LHC will be again .
We 're going to accinate , and we expect to get to right data to july or June , and we continue to find out what the morning is the morning to find what the morning universe .
Now , of course , in a way , these accidents reaccess the debate of science and engineering the value of science and engineering in frontier . It 's easy to confuture .
I think that 's so difficult , the fact of going to go beyond the limits , I think that 's value of things like the LHC .
I 'd like to end with the words of a Ingan scientist , Humphrey Davy , which , I imagine , in defense of the experiments of his pupin the inherent , his puplease in Michael Faraday , said , " Nichael Faraday , said , " Nient is so dangerous for the process , that 's not in the ideas that are definitive , that there are no misters , and that are not in the world . " And we don 't have a new worldate . "
Thank you .
I want to start asking you to rethink when children , you 're playing with the morning .
And as you get to reach them , and you get them , to take them and move them , to learn to think and solving problems , and they 're doing spaces , and manipulating relationships .
The space is deeply connected to the way we understand a lot of the world around us .
So , as information is inspired by the uses of our physical interaction with physics , together to my consulting Patts , and my collaborator Jeevan Kalanithi , I started asking , " And if we use a computer , instead of having the only cursor of the poller , which we can take a digital , we could deal with physically a desktop information with the manes of the process of the processes of our handscape
and sistemard-pleasure ?
The question was so interesting that we decided to explore the answer , building the answer , building the Siftable .
In a few words , a Siftare a big computer interactive as a cookie .
In a few words , a Siftare a big computer interactive as a cookie .
You can move them with hand , they can see , " in their hand , you hear their movement and have a radio screen .
But most photos , I 'm physical objects , you can just move them .
The Siftable is the example of a new ecosystem of tools to manipulate the digital information .
And as they get more physicists , conscious , of the other , of the other , and as they get more physical , conscious , of the movement of others , of how we move , we can explore new and fun interaction .
I 'll start with a few examples .
This Siftare is configurated to show the video : if it including it in a direction , the video run like this , if you including the other side back .
These interactive ritrats are conscious of others .
If you face them , they 're interested in what they 're around .
If they come around , they 're noticed it and they can act a little bit .
If they come around , they 're noticed it and they can act a little bit .
They have their movement and inclination .
We then realized that one of the interesting implications of the interaction was the power to use of data , for example , " to fall , " for example , " to fall . "
In this case , we have three Siftable configurated as a seck of vernice and I can use them to color in the central color in the central , where they mix .
and I can use them to color in the central color in the central , where they mix .
If we can be too , we can put a little bit of it .
They are also great possibilities to learn , like languages , like languages , the mathematics and games where people can try and see the fast immediately , and you see the immediately immediately .
Now ,
This is a Fibonacks that I do with a program of equations .
Here we have a words of words that is half between Scarabeo and Boggle .
Basically , at every turn a letter to any letter on every Siftable , Pratically , at every turn a letter to every turn on every Siftable , and while you 're trying to get words control about a direceither .
Then , after about 30 seconds , they remix , and you have a new set set of letters and new possibilities to try .
Thank you .
So this is the children came to the Media Lab , I did it , so that they were trying to them and spinning a video .
They 're very pileased .
And one of the interesting things about this kind of application is that you don 't have to give people many educations .
You 've only got to say , " Compons of words , " and they know exactly what to do .
Here 's other people who are trying to .
This is our younger head , right there .
It really wanted to impilate them .
They were only shooting morning , for him .
Now , this is a cartoon a cartoon cartoon .
We wanted to build a tool for languages .
It can insert new characters in the scene , solving the Siftable , they 're lifted .
It can insert new characters in the scene , solving the Siftable , they 're lifted .
So , it 's doing the sun .
Video : The sun is sunny .
David Merrill : Now he 's taken a tractor in the scene .
Video : The arange treator .
So , good work ! Yeah !
So I hit up to Siftable and put them close to interact the characters --
Video : Bau !
and by inventing their story .
Video : Hoo !
DM : It 's a story with the open open open , and it can decide how it 's going to be .
DM : It 's a story with the open open open , and it can decide how it 's going to be .
Video : Voly : Let , cat .
DM : The last example I have the time to show you is a tool , realized of the instrument , to walk and exececececk music .
is a tool , realized of recently , to walk and execececk music .
The Siftable here , they get from sound , like basically , the battery .
Each of these has four different variations , and you can choose what to use .
You can also insert these sound sound in a sequence to your floor .
And it 's just going to touch a sound and a sequence .
These are effects that you can control from the vive , like the reverbs and the filter .
You attacks it at a particular sound , and then including it .
And then there are the general effects as time and fly , which is applied to the whole sequence .
Let 's look at how it works .
Video : DM : We 'll start putting a base in two Siftable , we 're sequence in a series , we add it , we add it to the base .
I put a bottom line .
Video : DM : Now I add some percussions --
Video : And I 'll put the filter of the bacteria , so I can control the effect of the alive .
Video : DM : I can fall the entire sequence to the entire sequence from one side or another .
Video : DM : And I 'll just just just honey the basement to give more expression .
Video : DM : I can recombine the sequence .
So I don 't have to plan it first , but I can improvise , and it 's longer or more short .
And now , finally , I can leave the whole sequence with the left Siftable to the left Siftable .
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is to build new multiple machine and more more like how our brain work .
And today , I had time to show you one of the results of this way , and also a few possibilities that we 're trying to bring out of the lab .
The concept I want to transmitted is that it 's coming this new generation of projects designed to interact with digital media , which will bring information in our world as we want .
Thank you very much .
I don 't see the time to talk to all of you .
I 'm a writer .
And it 's my profession , but it 's more than this , of course .
It 's also love and the fasine of my life .
And I don 't expect that it can change .
But , I said this , something particular happened in my life and in my character , which has taken me to realibrate the entire relationship with this work .
The particular thing is that I recently wrote this book , this biography called " Manogy , Prega , Ama , " which , diversed from my previous books , for some reason in the world and become a big sensationship .
And the result is that everywhere go , people are going to me as if I were convicted .
It 's true -- convicted , convicted .
They 're going to me now all worried and they say , " Don 't you fear more than we could do better ?
Do you have no fear to continue to writing all life without being able to create a book that can important to somebody to be able to do a book that ? "
what can do you do ? "
It 's record , you know .
But it could go worse , at the worse , I remember than 20 years ago , when I started to say -- I was a adolescent adolescent -- I was a writer .
I walked up to the same reaction of fear .
And people said , " Don 't you be able to succeed ?
Do you have no fear that the humiliation of killed ?
Do you wouldn 't be doing this for all life without that nothing is ever outside and die on a cumouth of drive to fallish a hundreds of of failure ? "
So , you know .
The answer -- the short answer all these questions is , " Yes . "
Yes , I 'm afraid of all those things .
I 've always had afraid .
And I also fear of many other things that people could not must must must be involved .
As the algathering and other frightening things .
But , as it was to write the what I thought and wondered , I was that I was going to be why ?
Is it rational ?
It 's logical that anyone who has to wait to be spended by a work that 's been born to do .
But what 's so particular in the creative impress to make nervous to make us nervous about health and other people in a way that other paper do not ?
As my father , for example , he was a chemical engineer and I don 't remember a only time in his 40 years of activity where he was asked if it was fear to be engineer ?
And there was never -- that block of the engineer John , how do it ?
Don 't you know , you know ?
Onests , chemicals as a group have no , in the chemicals , the reputation of being handed in the reputation of being handed hand-depresssances .
We have this reputation , we have this reputation , and not only creative writers , but creative reputation of being enormously instable mentally .
And I 'm not looking at the other thing else of the dead , of the magnificent magnificent minds that , only in the 20th century , young and often for them .
And the ones who don 't have suicipate to be really disfaced by their dons .
Norman Mailer , before he died in the last interview , " Every my book killed me a little bit more " . " A extraordinary affermation about work in their life .
But we don 't blew the blind , when we hear this , so long , we 've completely interior , and accepted the notion that creativity and suffering are in a way of lined and that art , at the end , in the end .
And the question I want to get to all of today is : you know , you know , what about this idea ?
It 's good about this thing -- because it also looks at a centimeter distance to me , I don 't go well to anything this suppose .
I think it 's hate .
And I think it 's dangerous , and I don 't want to see the perpetuated century .
I think it 's better encouraging our big creative creative minds live .
And I know that , in my case -- in my case -- in my situation -- would be very dangerous to start at the end of the support , especially , you 're in my career .
That 's what you 're looking at , I 'm pretty young , I 've got about 40 years .
I still have four decades work in me .
And that 's very likely that anything to write about now is going to write from the world as the work that was coming out of the last time that I was going to be judged by the last book .
I 'm slavery , because we 're all about friends here -- is likely that my greatest myself .
Oh , Gesus , who thinking !
You know this is the kind of thinking of it takes a person to start drink a person to go to the nine in the morning , and I don 't want to do it .
I would keep to continue to do this work that I love .
So , the question is , how about it ?
And so it seems , after many reflections , that the way to work to keep writing is to create a psychological cougical protected , OK ?
I had to find a security distance between me , which I 'm writing , and my natural reaction on which is going to get the scale of reaction that will get . And as I was trying to all the scormodel of the year , looking through time , trying to find other societies to see if they could have the best ideas to have the best ideas and healthy of sane .
about how to help people creative to get the inherent inherent inherent creativity .
And that research took me to the ancient Grece and ancient Rome .
Sem me because it 's a circle , and then back .
In the ancient Grecia and ancient Rome -- people didn 't seem to believe that creativity came from men , OK ?
And it was thought that creativity was this spirit of beautiful and it came to somebody from somebody who 's source from one of the slightly distant reasons and unknown .
The greenholds were called these spirits of creativity of the demons .
You know , wonderly , he believed to have a demon a demon a demon a distant wisdom .
The Romans were the same idea , but they call that kind of spirit with a genius .
which is great , because the Romans wasn 't really thought that a genius were a particularly smart .
They thought a genius was this kind of a divine that was thought of entities that was literally lived in the walls of an artist , a little bit like the elfter Dobby , and that came out of assistance and to the outside of that work of that work .
Except -- here 's the distance of which I talk about -- that 's the distance of the psychological cousual that protects you from your work .
And everybody knew that it was so that it worked , right ?
So the anti-protected artists were protected by certain things , like the too narcism , right ?
If your work was exceptional work was exceptional you could get all the deserve , all knew that you were helped by this incorporate genius .
If your failure work , it wasn 't all your own , right ?
Everybody knew that was your genius to be a hunable .
And so people han concept creativity in West for a long time .
And then Rencing came and everything changed , and it was born , and this big idea ; we put the human being in the center of the universe above all the misters and more leaving space to writing creatures that writing down from divinity .
This was the rational principle of humanity and people started thinking that creativity came to think that creativity came from the idividate .
And for the first time in history , he started referre to this or that artist as a person as a rather than one person in genius .
And I have to tell you , I think it was a big mistake .
I think allow someone , a simple person to believe , like a recipient as the source , the essence and the source of all the divine divine , creative , unknowable and ethernal file and a huge responsibility for humans .
It 's how to ask somebody to inguishing the sun .
And it 's a distores , completely the ego and creates all these intuitive aspectations on performance .
And I think it was this to have this pressure to have the artists in the past 500 years .
And if that 's true , and I think that 's true , and what 's going on , and now ?
Can we do it different ?
Maybe back to a more advance of the relationship between human relationship and mystery .
Or maybe you 're not .
Maybe we can 't cell 500 years of rational thinking in a 18 minutes .
And there is people between the audience that would sollevered suspicious suspicians on the notion of the notion of the notion of the notion of their projects .
Probably not convince you all about this thing .
But the question I would like to get is -- why not ?
Why don 't think this way ?
Because more sense of everything else that I 've ever heard to explain the exassume of the creative process .
A process that , as anyone who has ever tried to do something -- so , basically , everybody here -- knows , you don 't understand rationally .
And in fact , it can sometimes completely paranormal .
I did this meeting recently with the extraordinary poetetetetetetetetetetetetetetetetetetesse , but that was a poetesse for all life and told me that in the World Web , working out in the Virginia , working out in the wandscape .
He told me that it was like a fragorous air track .
And that was rotolating back to her from the landscape .
He was to be able to hear , because it was so much of the land under his feet .
He knew to have one thing to do at that point and it was , words like a matta . "
And so it was back to the home and he wouldn 't have to get a piece of paper , and it would not have to get a paper , while the trapart , and raised it , and raised it on the page .
Sometimes he couldn 't fast enough , so he runs and run walked out of the house and wrote her back to the house and poem her through her and wild her through the landscape , and he would keep through the landscape , and how she said , " one more poet . "
Then there were those times -- this piece of time -- this is , there were moments where it was almost losing it , OK ?
So , it was running house and was looking for the paper and the poem was going through , and he was a handle in the way that she was going , and then he said , that it was like to be sleeping with the other hand and it wood .
And he was going to the poem from the tail and reput it in his body and the page .
And in these cases , the poem would be presented on the perfect page and intact , but on the last word at the first .
So when I felt that -- it 's crazy , it 's crazy , it 's exactly equal process .
Not all my creative process -- I 'm not a condition .
I 'm a mulo , and my way to work is ; you wake up to wake up and work and go and go and go on on on it .
But even I , in my head , I 've striked against that thing , at sometimes .
And I guess that many of you , the han done .
You know , even if the work and ideas were saying from a certain source , I could not honestly .
And what is this thing ?
And how can we relate to it to it out of the head , but , rather , that make us remaintain healthy ?
And as it is , the best example of the contemporary example I have is the Tom Waits , which I interviewed a different years ago for a newspaper day .
We were talking about this , and you know , Tom , for most of life was the incarnation of the artist gesture of the artest recontemporary , and to control , gesture , dominate these species of the impulses totally internal creative .
But then he got up , he got up , and one day as it was driving on a car in Los Angeles , changed everything for him .
It was walking quick and everything of a sent , this little fragment of melody , which came into the inspiration , elusive and strong , and you want to , you know , it 's wonderful , and it 's wonderful , and it wells it , but not how to take it .
It has no paper , has no paper , it doesn 't have a paper , it doesn 't have a register .
So it starts to hear this kind of old anxiety growing in him , " I 'm going to lose , and I 'll be obsessed by this song .
I 'm not good enough and I can 't do it . "
And instead of going to the panic , they stop .
And he was going to be the whole mental process and he did something completely new .
And he just looked at the sky and said , " Don 't you see that I 'm driving ? "
" You know , " Do you know , a song now ?
If you really want to be back to a more opports , when I can take care of you .
Otherwise , I walked to take something else today .
You know , I 'm going to see Leonard Cohen . "
And his work is working on it changed after this .
Not the work , the job still , the job as always .
But the process , and the fish that was that attornied it was required when genius , the genius , the genius out of him that problems and flew it back to where they were , and he had to be able to do it back to where it was , and made .
but it 's bad , this bad bluean , wonderful conversation between Tom and this strange thing that strange and external thing that was not Tom .
So how much the story I started changing a little bit the way I worked and I was saved up to me .
This idea , I was writing " Manogy , Prega , Ama , Prega , Ama , " and fall in one of those handing hundred of of of the disperation where we all get working on something and we can 't start thinking that it will be a disaster , which is going to be a disaster , which is going to be the worst book .
Not just the worst book , just the worst book .
And I started thinking about gectackaging this project .
But then I remember Tom that was talking to the air and I tried us .
So you get my face on the end of the manufacturing and my hit in a vacuum of the room .
And I said , " Deep , " What we 're both known to you that if this book is not going to be interest , not going to be interest , right ?
Because as you see all I 'm putting all I have , I don 't have that .
So if you want it to be better , you have to present you and do your part .
OK . But if you don 't do it , you know what , I don 't do .
I 'll writing the same thing .
And I would like to be a please that I 've been shown that I 've been shown for me for me , " Why -- the end is so , OK -- seats ago in North deserts people were raded for the close to hours of hours of the close , dances and music that were going to go forward for hours and hours .
And they were always magnific , because the ballery were professionals and they were fantastic .
But every once , something happened , and something happened , and one of these artists becomes actually transport .
And I know you know what I 'm talking about , because I know you all live at a point , at a point , a performance .
It was like the time stopped , and the dance dance ballery and walked through a kind of a brand nothing different from the usually , like 1,000 nights before , but all sorts of all over the 1,000 nights before , but all sorts of it .
And suddenly , it doesn 't appepeared as a human .
But it 's accurate from the divinated and the fire in fire divinity .
And when this happened , at the time , people knew what was , they call it with her name .
They were congestion and they start canting , " Allah , Allah , Allah , God . "
That 's God , you know .
And he was saying -- when Ms invading the South of the Spanish , I took this habits and , and they got this habits in the centuries from " Allah , Allah , Allah , Allah , " , " that 's the run , " which , " that 's yet , " that 's still , " that 's yet . "
In Spain , when a artist has made something impossible and magic , " Allah , the run , " Allah , " Buh , magnificent , " -- I 'm going to go out of God .
And it 's great because we need it .
But the problem is goes the day after the dance of dance , when you woke up and discover that are the 11 morning of Marteden and the God 's not .
It 's just a bad mortal with ginoccurred , and maybe it will never be able to height to the height .
And maybe no one will spoke the name of God while it 's going to do with the rest of his life ?
It 's hard .
This is one of the most pain recognition to make a creative life .
But maybe it has to be so angosh to be so angoscious if you can 't believe , lungly-the-being , which is the extraordinary aspects of your being .
But you just believe that you have to be a very unimaginable source of this squisite part of your life that you have to get to somebody else when you finished .
And , you know , if we think it 's this whole changes .
And so I started pended , and it 's certainly like this , and it 's like this for a different months in the work of the book that I 'm publiliking , and the dangerous , and I was going to be in my graphor , I was going to follow my graphor .
And what I have to continue to say when I feel elecrized from this is , not having .
You don 't fit . It 's just your work .
It 's about your part , any way , you know , any one of them .
If your work work is dance , bad .
If the divine , you know , you know , I 'd leave up decide to leave a few kind of wonderful , for one moment through your efforts , then , " Okay ! "
Otherwise , you do the same dance .
And " Ole ! " " at yourself .
I think we have to teach it .
" Olay ! " to yet the same , even for humans to have lower human testardaggin and tal tals to you continually .
Thank you .
Thank you .
June Cohen : Ole !
And you know , I 've been talking about some of these projects on the human genome , about what can mean and discovery of new genes .
We 're starting a new path : we started digitalize biology and now starting to start on that digital code we 're going to a new phase of biology , designing and synthetizing life .
We 've always tried to get big questions .
" What is life ? " is something that many biologists think have taken lifs .
We have different approaches , reduced it to the minimes .
We 're digitalizing from almost 20 years .
When we sequenced the human genome was about pass from the analog world in the digital world .
Now we 're ask : can we regenerate life , or create new from this digital universe ?
This is the map of a little organism , the Mycoplasma genitalium , which is the smallest genitalium of those who can autorem in the lab .
And we tried to reduce the genome of it , and we try to create one even smaller .
We 're able to eliminate a hundred genes of the way of the 500 that are here .
But when we take a look at his metabolic map , it 's relatively simple than our .
Let me , this is simple .
But when we look at all the genes that we can eliminate , one at a time , it 's very improbable that this can bring a living cell a living cell .
So we decided that the only way to progrew this cromosome of synthesize this cromosome of the fundamental questions .
And so we started the adventure of " The adventure of " Can we synthesize a cromosome ? "
Can you have to produce these big molecules that we never have to create before ?
And , in case , we can make a cromosome ?
A cromosome is simply a chemical material chemical material .
The speed with which we 're able to digitalize life is growing at exponential .
We 're ability to writing the genetic code , instead , rather prodiscussion , rather slowly , but it 's better .
And our most recent results that branched on a exponential curve .
We started over 15 years ago .
The process required a lot of pasages , starting with a bioetic review before we begin .
But we found that DNA synthesize that DNA is very hard .
There are tens of thousands of machines in the world that make small segment of DNA , 30 to 50 letter , and it 's a degenerative process : the longer segment is longer , the segment is longer , the more errors .
So we had to develop a new method to assembly these fragments and correct the errors .
And this was our first attempt , to start digital information from the genome of Phi X 174 .
It 's a little batters that kills .
We designed the fragments , we 've designed the recorrection of errors and got a DNA molecule of about 5,000 letters .
The interesting part is when we took this piece of inert material inert and we put it in the bacteria , bacteria have started reading this genetic code and producing the genetic code and produced the viral particles .
The viral particles have been released by the cells , they were back and destroyed the E. coli .
I 've been talking about recent with membres of the oil industry , which they have certainly compressed this model .
They have more than you .
We believe this is a situation where software can actually build his hardware in a biological system .
But we wanted to do the bigger .
We wanted to build the whole cromosome chromosome .
They 're over 580 thousand letters of genetic code .
So we thought I would build it in a cassettes of the virus , so that we could change the cassettes for which are the components of a living cell .
The design is critical design is critical , and if we start with digital information in a computer , these must be very accurate .
When we sequency this genome for the first time in 1995 , the standards was a herror for every 10 thousand low .
We 've found , resequency it , 30 errors . If we used that original sequence we would never be able to work .
One part of the process is designing 50 letters that are supposed to be able to get over 50 letters to build up with all segment segment of the smaller , working together .
We try to get one unique elements here .
You probably have a bed thing that we put on the right filit fic filiglay .
Think it so : we have a genetic code on four letters : A , C , G and T.
Three of those letters together coded about 20 friend , and there 's a specific order to the military lots of letters .
So we can use genetic code to writing words , frages , thoughts .
What we did at the beginning was autograped .
Some have been used by the fact that it wasn 't poetry .
We 've designed these segments to just join it .
There are enzymes that reputs them and put them assime .
And we started assembly with the parts , starting with segment of five to segment , and unended up to segment of 24 miles letters to them to get to 72 thousand letters .
We have produced these segments in abundance so that we can take them through sequence so that we 're trying to create a extremely robstood -- as you 'll see in a minute .
We 're trying to automatizing the process .
So , this looks like the tabellon a basket .
When we get these very long segments , more than 100 thousand , over 100 thousand , they will never grow more directly in the E. coli .
You go to the molecular modern modern biology .
So we 've been considered other mechanisms .
We knew about another mechanism mechanism called homologa , which in biology that we 're using DNA can une the DNA that can join the segment .
So , this is an example .
This organism , called Deinococcus radiodurans , it can absorbed three million rads .
You can see in the super super super suffer like his chromosom .
In 12 -- 24 hours is reassembled exactly how it was before .
There are thousands of organisms that are able to do it .
These organisms can be sitting completely .
They can live under vacuum .
They 're all of the way of life exist in space , and you move to find new environments of water .
In fact , NASA showed that this happens .
This is a picture of the molecule that we 've built these processes , just using the least design with the segment of the segment of insert .
The yeast assemble them , automatically .
This image was not taken with an electronic microscope , but with a regular microscope .
It 's a big molecule that we can see it with a law microscope .
These are pictures that cover a time of about six seconds .
This is the publish we 've done a little time ago .
They 're over 580,000 letters of genetic code .
It 's the largest molecule of a defined structure that man ever made of man .
It has a weight molecular weight in 300 million .
If we were a caratter 10 without spaces , they would take 142 pages , they would just take this genetic code .
Now , how do we work ?
Of course , you lose a virus is a game .
It 's a little more complicated when they use bacteria .
It 's simpler even when it comes to eucariote as our eucariote , you can just extract the nucleus and insert another , which is basically the clonation process .
In the battery archaea , the chromosome is integrated inside the cell , but we 've recently recently recently , we recently recently , which is a beautiful cromosome of a cell cell to another and activity .
We can have a cromosom participating from a microbial species .
The two are different as men from mmen .
We have added a few gene in more way that you could decide what to choose for this cromosome .
And then the slightly with the enzymes so that they were killing to kill all proteins .
And when we put it in the cell in the cell was stupendity-handed graph -- the new chromosophisticatooos -- the new cell cell cell .
And we were we thought we couldn 't go beyond , but we 've tried to spinherself .
This is one of the largest mechanisms of evolution .
We 've found that many species have added species have added a third or a third romosom from a thousands of new tracks to that species .
So who think evolution as only gene to evolution as only gene to be modified by the biology .
There are a restriction of restriition that advance is going to digerisn 't restriition to inside the DNA .
The chromosome that was in the cell .
The cell phone that we 've got to inserit-fit .
And it 's expressed , and recognized the other chromosom as extended material , and we were found us with only the cell and the new cromosome .
is blue blue because of the genes we 've put .
And in a short time , all the characteristics of a species have gone , and it turned into a new species , based on the new species , on the new software that we put in the cells .
And all proteins are changed , and membranes are changed , and when we read the equivast as exactly what we 've been transferred to what we 've transferred to what we 've been transferred to what we 've been transferred to what we 've been transferred to what we 've been transfer .
Now , this could look like genetics genetics , but we 're going to get the software to change things in a pretty substantial way .
Now , I 've already explained that here is not a genesis -- but progress from three and a half million years of evolution , and I said that maybe we 're going to create a new version of Cambrian explosion of Cambrian explosion of Cambrian explosion of Cambrian explosion .
Why do that ?
I think it 's pretty obvious when we think about our need .
We 're going to spend six and a half billion people in the next 40 years .
Just to give you an example : I was born in 1946 .
Now , there are three people on the planet for each existing in 1946 ; there will be four .
We 're having problems now to find food , fresh water and clean , medicinal and gas for six billion people .
It will be more tough to do it for nine billion .
We use more carbon dioxide more than 30 billion oil .
That means millions of baris a day .
When we try to find biological processes , or anything like to reduce it it , it 's going to be a huge challenge .
We have to keep the whole emission of CO2 from these materials that end in the atmosphere .
And today , thanks to scientific discoveries around the world , we have a database with about 20 million genes , and I like to think they are designed for the future .
The electronics industry only only have a dozen about components , and you think about how many different things come out .
Our limits here are the data of biological reality and our imagination .
Now we have to have these techniques , thanks to these quickly synthetization , that can create what we call combinatory genomics combinatory .
We 're able to build a big robots that can produce a million cromosomes a day .
Think of processing these 20 million genes or to try to get the process of producing the processes to produce eight tankly , we can change , because of a little team , we can change , because of a little team , and create more biology in the last 20 years of science .
And it 's just a standards .
We can choose for possibility of survival , production , chemical or or fuel , production of etc vaccines .
This is an instantaneous instantaneous instantaneous programmed to be able to seat and design species to computers .
Well , we don 't necessarily know how they 're going to be .
We know exactly what their genetic code .
We 're now concentrating on the fuel fuel generation .
You also saw you that extract ethanol from the grate was a bad finished experiment .
We have fuel fuel and third generation that will be quite quite the soon the higher fuel value as the optest value of the higher value , like eight-value types of butanol .
But the only way that biology can have a big impact without increase more than increase the cost of food and limited the cost of food and limited the availability to transform CO2 in matter , so we 're working on to design cells that can achieve this cell , and we think we can get the first coal , and we think we can get the first generation in about eight months .
The solar light with CO2 is a metodock -- but in our discoveries around the world , we found different metods of the world , we found different metods .
This is an organism we described in 1996 .
It lives in the deep ocean , about 2500 feet deeption of water .
They put out of CO2 , we can use hydrogen molecular as energy source .
We 're trying to figure out if we can incanalate CO2 , which can easily be transported by tubes , convert that CO2 in fuel , to drive this process .
So , we think we could be able to increase what we can get to increase what the basic question is , what life is Nice , versus what life is Nice , versus -- we have the modly goal of replacing the entire industry .
Exactly . If you can 't do it from TED , where can you ?
It would be a main source of energy .
And also , we 're working on the same way to use to use the same metods to create instantaneous vaccines .
You saw this year with the flu , we 're always back to a year and with a dollar in less when it 's finding the vaccine is to the fair .
I think that this can change by fighting vaccines in advaccines .
So , this is how the future could start seemed to look at the time , evolution , now , accelerating the synthetic moving bacteria , arched , and finally cellus eucariote .
We 're so on the best people .
Our purpose is to be able to live long enough to try to do it . Thank you very much .
So , before all I 'll show you , the most fastest possible , some fundamental work , a new technology that we took to Microsoft in the following one year ago exactly . This is Seadragon .
This is a environment where you can interact is local level that you can interact with an enormous amount of visual data .
Here we 're seeing a lot of gabyte photos with a kind of photos , and continuous , for a panoramic , disponary , disponing the images as we want .
And it doesn 't matter how big the amount of information that we see , how big these are collected or images or the images .
Most of the one is digital photographs , but this is a scanning from the Bilibra library of Congress , and reenter in the 300 megapixel .
It doesn 't make any difference because the only thing that limits the prestations of a system like this is the number of pixel on your screen on your screen in any moment . It 's also a very flexible architecture .
This is a whole book , example , not images of data .
This is the Dickens of Dickens . Every colonna represents a chapter .
And to show you that it 's about textbook and not images , we can do something like that , to actually see that it 's a real representation of the text , not a picture .
It could be a little artificial way to read a book .
It doesn 't have it to you .
This is a more realistic . It 's a number of The Guardian .
Every picture is the beginning of a section .
And it gives you the beautiful and the beautiful experience of reading the version of a magazine or a news , which is for nature , a neighan neighan molteplice .
We also did something with the corner of this particular number of The Guardian .
We 've made a fasulla advertising -- much more than the one that you use in a normal published publicity -- and we put you in the extra fared .
If you want to see the characteristics of this automobile , you can see it here .
Or other models , or even the techniques techniques .
And this really shows some of these ideas to eliminate the limits of space on the screen .
We hope that this means to put the pop-up to the pop-up and other porcheries , not must be necessary .
Of course , maps is one of the obvious applications for this kind of technology .
And on this thing , I don 't want to lose you , if not to say that we have contributes to get in this field .
These are all the streets in the U.S. Howspspacecraft of NASA .
So now we 're going to something else .
This is actually from the Web , you can go to the Web ; you can go to see .
This is a project called Photosynth , which combine two different technologies .
One is Seadragon and the other is a visual research at the Noah Snavely , a student of the University of Washington of the U.S. Steve Steve eitz of the UW and Rick Szeliski .
And it 's from Seb , gested by Seadragon .
You can see it when we do this kind of screen , where we can go from from an image to another and have this kind of experience .
But the spacectal collit here has actually a meaning .
The algorithms of visualization of computers have recorded these images together , so that corresponding to the real place in real place in which the picture -- all of the Grasis on the Montagne RWWWWWWWWocciose canad-IIRWWWWocciose canad-stable show , and these things have been connected . So , these things have been connected to spend of a slide-graph , and these things have all the space space space space space space space space .
I don 't know if I have time to show you a few other environment .
There are some much more space .
I want to spend directly to one of the original data set of Nohah-- and this is from a prototype of Photosynthic data that we 've made for the first scorseum of the scorsea , that 's really the key behind this technology , Photosynthic . And it 's not necessarily , just look at the environments we put in the website .
We had to worry about the legal aspects and so on .
This is a reconstruction of the catthedral Dame of the Flickr . Basta digitar . Basta digitar , Flickr and you get images of types in maglights , other way , and so on . So , all of these arancions , the shirt of the shirt of the slide of the picture of the model of the square .
So they 're all pictures taken from Flickr , and they were all connected to this way .
And it 's possible to have a very simple way .
You know , I never thought I 'd never thought I 'm finish to work for Microsoft .
It 's very gratifically remember this kind of accoky here .
I think you can see that it 's a lot of different kinds of squezes of different phones , from those SLR , a significant phones to the SLR , a significant number , must set in this environment .
And if I can , I try to try to look for those strange .
And so many of them are faces , and that 's a faces .
Somewhere there is a series of photographs -- here it 's a series of photographs -- and that 's a lot of photographs -- and that 's a series of photographs -- here it 's a series of photographs -- and that 's a lot of photographs -- and that 's a lot of photographs -- and that 's a whole thing .
This is a poster of Notre Dame recorded correctly .
We can move from the poster to the vision of this environment .
The essential point is that we can do things with social environment . This is now taking data from the ential memory -- from the whole memory of how the land , from vision -- and connections all those data together .
All those pictures are linked together , more than the sum of the parts .
You have a model of the entire emerges .
Think about this as a prolungment of Stephen Lawler 's work on Earth .
It 's something that grows in complexity as a lot of people who do it , and the advantages for people to use it .
Their picture are brand with lots of other people .
If somebody is the idea of contracting all these saying the name , my photos of Notre catthedral chthedral chthedral and recognize of all of the data , and I can use it as a place in that metaphor to the space in that metaphor , in that metaphor , in that metaphing the photos of cross-moke cross-mod-like cross-moke .
Of course , a consequence of all this is virtual models of any interesting part of the land , interesting part of the land , collective , you don 't just like aircrazy airs and similar , but from a whole memory .
Thank you very much .
Chris Anderson : I realized ? What your software will connected to us to do is that at a point in the next few years , all the photographs shared by anyone in the entire world will be basically lined together ?
BAA : Yeah . What it 's doing is basically discover .
It 's creating hyperlink , if you want , between images .
And it 's doing it in the basis on the content of the pictures .
The thing becomes very interesting if you think about the wealth of semantic information that 's semantic information that many of these images have .
As when you get a picture of the web , you 're digits phrase and the text on the Web page has a lot of information about the picture .
Now , what if that picture is that picture to all your picture ?
So the amount of semantic interconnection and the amount of wealth that is really huge . It 's a classic classic effect of the network .
CA : Blaise , it 's really incredible .
BAA : I thank you very much .
One of the major pleasures when you travel and one of the etnographics of the ancient search of the anti-forget in the wind , the wind of the wind , the wind in the wind piogges , the wind in the wind leg , leaves it in the wind leap .
Basti thinking , Jaguar snaman of the Wilattea , or that the Inuit , or that the Inuit is still a model of meaningly , or that in Himalayas , the budgen of Dharm , to remember the major of the major , to remember the major model , and the idea that the world that we live in no sense , it 's just a model of reality , but it 's just a model of reality ,
the result of a particular set set set of adaptations that our own own own own own own own own own bad , many generations ago .
And , of course , we all share of the essential tracts .
We all sorts . Everybody 's procrease .
We 're going to be repects to the initiation .
We have to deal with the inesorability of death , so we don 't surprise and we 're going to get out of and the damn .
We all have an art .
What hit is the particular song , the rhythm of the song of every culture .
It doesn 't matter that they are the Penan forests of the Borneo or the following of Haiti , or the following Borrieday , or the desert Kenya Shya Saharert in Kenya , or a cammas in Sahara .
He was my journey of journey in the desert a month ago , or a yak of the Qomolangm , on the Everest , the dead in the Everest , the dead in the world .
All of these people teaching us that there are other ways of existing , other ways of thinking , other ways of model in the world .
And if you think , if you think , it 's a concept that you can give you hope .
Insized together , cultures of the world 's cultures creating a spiritual life and cultural life that 's important for the planet well-being and cultual well-being of the planet as the planet as the planet as the planet as the as a biosphere .
And you can think about this cultural ragela of a clever , and you can define the ethnosphere , the total sum sum of all the concepts , dreams , moves , inspiration , intuitions , witches , intuitions , inspiration ,
The etnosphere is the patrimonum of humanity .
It 's the symbol of what we are and what we can be as inquisitive species .
And because the biosphere was a large consumed as it happened to the etnosfetnosly and purely much .
No biologist , for example , it would say that 50 percent of all species , or is on the horrim of the simply simply extinction because it 's false -- in the most optimistic hypocalypocalypocalypocalm -- and not near that near that 's even close to the most optimistic -- that of the cultural diversity .
The index of all this is , of course , the linguistic loss .
When you were born 6,000 languages on this planet .
A language is not just from a vocabolarian or a series of rules .
One language is the shriny of human spirit .
It 's the middle of which the animal of every culture is in the material world .
Every language is a forest of the mind , a both of mind , a spiritual chance .
And of those 6,000 languages , while we 're here sitting in Monterey , at least half of the children .
They don 't get taught to children , which means , unless you walk , unless you won 't walk something , which are already dead .
What 's more sad than being the sad of the silent , of being the last several language , not have way to transmit the wisdom of wisdom or anticipate promised the promised of children ?
This is a floor of people in the world every two weeks : every two weeks , a holding , and a door to the tomba moment and brings with it to the tomba lot .
And I know somebody who 's going to say , " Don 't it better ?
The world would not be a better place if we 're all about language ? " " Well , we 're talking to all yorba . We talk to all yorba . We talk to the cantonese .
We talk kogs .
You 'll get a transact thing that means not to talk about language .
I 'd like to do a journey through etnosphere --
a little journey in the etnosh to give you a little bit of what we 're losing .
Many of us forget that when I say , " different ways of existing existing very different ways of existing .
Let 's take this for example Barasana Barasana , in Amazon the saconia , the people of the anaconda , which believes the myth of the sacred flume of sacred from the float of snap .
It 's a popular that 's not able to distinguish the blue color from the green because the cell of the forest , because the cell of the forest , which depends the popular popular .
They have a strange language and a matrimonic rule , called " language : " : " You have to mark you a different person talking about a different language .
And all of this roots in the past , yet the particular past , is that in these families that are talking about six or seven languages that are talking about six or seven languages , no one language .
They 're just going to listen to listening and they start talking .
We take one of the most interesting tribe that I lived , the Waorani East Ecuador Ecuador , a popular popular that has the first contacts in 1958 .
In 1957 five missionaries have taken a factor .
They did never have been taken photographs that were retops , and forest that they had never seen that this population population , and that this popular forests of pluvial forest .
They 've raised the land , they turned to the research of a form or a figure and , not found nothing , they have concluded that it was that it was the display of the displance .
But the Waorani don 't just killed the straneyesterday .
They killed between them .
54 percent of the mortality was caused by themselves .
We 've risky high generations , and we found two death cases of natural , and when we style to know , they have admitted that one of them , aged , and then they were killed it . And then they killed it the same . And then they had a very incredible knowledge of the forest .
The hunters were able to recognize the animal hurine for 40 steps and recognize the species .
In the early ' 80s , I was assigned a very interesting task when my Harvard professor , asked me if I wanted to go to Haiti to Haiti me if I wanted to go to Haiti to the base of Duvalier and Tonton Macouter , and impossessed me to get zombies .
To make sense of miraculous miraculous , I should understand the Voooodoo culture and that Vooodoo or is not magic .
It 's pretty much of a complex metaphysical vision of the world .
Very interesting .
If I asked you to tell me the great religions of the world , what would you say ?
Christianthor , Islam , Budddism , Ebraism , etc .
A continent is always left out , thinking that sub-Saharan Africa has not religious field religious . And instead of these religious religious concepts of these religious religious concepts of these religious concepts deep in the tragic tragic diaspora of slavery .
What makes it interesting vote is the vote of life and death .
So the living are going to the spirits .
They can be invited by the Great Acqua , they respond to the dance of dance and replaced temporary to the soul of the vive of the way that for a short way that for a short across the goal .
So , the voodooists like , " You 're going to go white God .
We 're saying in the temple and divention God . "
And from the moment that you 're going to be the spirit that you , as you 're going to do you , as you ?
So you 're seeing these incredible events : following voodoo in state of trance that touch , and you 're going to be able to demonstration rather strongly .
And in all the populations with the most extraordinary people are the Kogi Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta , in Columbia sectourional sectourional sectourional .
And it comes to the ancient civilization that once had on the character plug of Colombic plug in the waiting of the conquert , popular popular , which is a vulcanic massive plan .
In a blood continent , this popular , this popular popular , this popular popular .
And so , they have governed by a clero but their formation is very extraordinary .
The young people follow away from the family to three or four years , and they live secregated in a good world , and they live in a good world , and shadow in the boats of the glacier for 18 years .
Two periods of nine years , proposed to reproduce the nine months of the gestation that spend in the usered of mother , now are metaphically in the Great Mmother .
So , that 's all over time , they get acculturated to the values of their society , values that they have to predict and their precient prayers , they keep the cost of their own equilibrium , or to say the balance of their equilibrium .
At the term of this incredible initiation , they 're sudden , and for the first time in their lives , at age 18 , they see a high . And in that account of the first cutes of the first cutes , when the sun kety beautiful valley , everything that they learned in theory , everything that they learned in theory , it 's confirm everything that they learned in theory , and it says ,
" Would you . " I said . "
It 's amazing . It 's about you . "
They 're called largest frators and say that we , brothers , we 're the hit of destruction of the world .
This is intuition is extremely important .
When we think about Indigene and we 're invoking Rously and the old story of the noble self-vages , which is a razy concept , which is a razy concept in its simplicity or perhaps we 're closer to the Earth .
The Ingenes are not equal feels , not indebullet .
There is no space for these things in the malaries of Astmon or 's vent winds of the Tibet , but thanks at time and the rites , they created a mystical mystical of the Earth , not on the concept of being known as well as well as a blue , but on a blue more subtle : the concept that the Earth can only be able to be able to be known because it 's confidence of human confidence .
What does it mean ?
That 's a boy of the Ande that grows up , and creding that the mountain is a huge spirit that will drit his destiny is going to be a different deep . And it will have a different relationship with the mountain or that place , and it 's going to be a different rock of Montana who grows a kid in Montana , and it 's a male of rock that a rock of being screen .
which is the dimora of one spirit or a mineral crazy is irrelevant .
What 's interesting is the metaphor that defines the relationship between the natural and the natural world .
I grew up in the forests of Columbia Britannica creding that forests served to be cut .
And that made me a different human being from my friends Kwakiutl who believe that the forests are the Hukukuk and the beak stories of the paradise and the stories of paradise and the dogs that live on the northern world , spirits that are in the world , spirits that are dealing in the Hamator .
If you start to look at these cultures can create different reality , you can start to understand some of their sensationship . We take this plant .
I took this picture to open in the nordoccipites in the nordoccipites .
Maybe some of you have heard of the ayahuasca , the most powerful physician repertopic repertoire .
What makes the ayahuash the ayahuash is not the potential physical potential of the substance , but its elements . It 's two elements .
From a hand , this lethun leaching a series of beta-carboline , harmine and harmine , slightly .
Take the only plant , you have a blue smoke that allow a little bit the consciousness , but it 's miscale of the family of the Psychotria family of Psychotria .
This plant contains sought , very similar to seroth-like , dimethoxiyptamine-thoxyptamines .
If you never see Yanomami , thoxyanomami , they do from a different set of species , anchly methoxyptamine .
And to be that policy on the nose is a little bit of how to be disappeared by a fire fire bateures and land on a sea of electricity . You know , it 's a destortion of reality .
I had often often , Richard Evan Shultes , the man who took the man psychedelic , with his discovery of the fungi , with its discovery of the ends of the hallucinogens in the 1930 in Mexico .
I 'm going to do my thesis , you can 't be to be classified . And you can 't tell any one of being hallucinated . And then you can 't tell any one of being hallucinated . And the triptaminy , but they can 't be horically because they are money from a enzyme that you are naturally in the inossilly , in the inossilly , in the inossir .
You can just take it up if you have to get to other chemicals that money at the MAO .
Now it 's the beautiful : : Ccarboline , which is the beautiful thing that is suggers of MAO , the same kind of necessary , as the same as the way as a 80,000 species of plants , like these populations , like these popular populations , like these populations are not similar , but if you combine in this way , create a biochemical version that 's summmmma summmmma summma ?
We use the great euphermism of proof and error , which can be infruttify .
But if we ask the Indian , they 'll tell us , " The plants talk about it . "
What does it mean ?
This tribe , the Cofan , the Cofan , has 17 varieties of the game , and that are going to be in the forest , and that our eyes would be going to into the same species .
If we ask them how they are going to be , " I thought of the plants , " I thought of plants , you know , the rest ? " I didn 't . "
The solution is : you take the 17 varieties in a night of the moon and each night with a different .
And that doesn 't fleea to Harvard , but it 's much more interesting that content stams .
Now , [ the problem is that even the problem is that even those of us who have heart people who have in the ingenes are painting them , but somehow reduced to the margins of history in the real world , and it 's a bit more .
In fact , the 20th century , between 300 years , it will not remember for its wars or its technologies , but rather like the era where we were stopped and hug activity of the planet . Now the problem is not the change .
All cultures through the centuries have been involved in a dance for new life .
And the problem is not technology .
Indian Sioux have no stopped to be Sioux when they put out of it and flew out of Americans , they don 't stop being Americans when they put out of Americans , when they put from the horse and hot .
It 's not the change or technology that 's the change or technology that integrity . It 's the power .
The domination .
If you look at the world , you 'll find that these are not cultures cultures are not cultures of disappeared .
They 're living and dynamics spinds out of the existence from identifiable forces that go beyond their ability .
Which is that the disboscaring in the Patria of the Penan --
a populpulpulum named Sarak , in the Souast Asian , a popular populum that lived in the forest to a generation , and now reduced to the servitch and prostitution on the revenue of the rives of the rive revolved of the revolved of lives that floor of the MCinese Merian Merian , where the navels the horizing naves of the horries ,
takes the stage with the wood dream of the forest .
Or in Yanomami , are the disease , are the disease came to the gold .
If we move on the Tibet mountains in the Tibet , where I 'm doing a lot of political domination .
As you know the genocide , the physical extinction of a popular , is convicted to universal level , but ethncide , destruction of the people 's living the lives of a popular , not only is convicted , but it 's not convicted , but it 's part of the strategy development .
And you can 't understand the Tibet is suffering from the beginning .
I lost the 6,000 miles from China in China in the Western Cocdental Tibet , coming to Lhasa with a young , but only came to Lhasa , I realized what 's behasa , I realized what we 're going to talk about .
6,000 sacred sacred to dust and cends .
1.2 million people killed from the military during Cultural Rivolution .
The father of this guy was ascritical at Panchen Lama .
which means it was killed to the time of Chinese Inasion .
His the cluster with Sua Santity in the diaspora that led the popular in Nepal .
His mother been impressed and her hit was to be rich .
It was taken about a handle of two years old hidden under his gonna because it wouldn 't live without him .
The sister , who did the same , was a reeducation .
One day has been walked up a day , a fashion a short coffered Mao and , for this transgression , was mespan for seven years .
The pain of Tibet can be insuit , but the reference of the people of the popular popular is to the popular .
And then , all the time , all reduces to a choice .
We want to live in the monocromatc world or we want to acking the polices of diversity ?
The great anthropologist Margaret Mead , before he died said that his greatest fear was that in our way to the love of the world , we will not only see the whole gama of human imagination of human imagination , we 'll think , and one day we 'll wake up from a sleep , but one day we 'll have a sleep from a sleep , and we 'll get from a sleep from a sleeping of the possibilities .
And it 's umiliating our species is existed for 600,000 years .
The Neolitical Revolution , who gave us the agriculture , which made us suck to the cult of seed cult , and replacing the poem of the skiloss , creating the gerarchy of the specialization , and we 're talking 10,000 years ago .
The modern industrialized world has 300 years .
That shelf of the story , not suggests that we have to all the answers to all the challenge that we have to go .
When these myries of cultures of the world is asked what it means to be human , they say , " Fify different with 10,000 different voices .
And that 's in these answers that all we all risky the possibility of being what we are : a conscious species , which has to make all the people , and all the people have to challenges and all the gars can travels .
I took this picture on the northy of the island of Baffin Baffin , when I went to hunt whales with Inuit , and this man , Olaya , Olaya , Olaya , he tells me the wonderful story of his grandfather .
The Canadian government has not always been gentleman with the Inuit and in the 1950s to stay our supremise , we 've rhink them in colonies .
The grandfather of this man was refected to go .
The family , themselves for her life , he took them all over the arms , and all his atticks .
You have to know that Inuit doesn 't matter cold , the frankly , the frankly .
The bats of the slexes in origin were made of charges in the skin .
The grandfather of this man didn 't intimise from the Arctic or the libraries that suffering .
It 's gathered away , it 's calculated the pattern of football and defected in their hand . When the photos , they 've been congelated , they 've been working on a bama lama blue .
He spred on the door of this caccess , and when it became solid , he killed a dog .
He washed the dog and created a brid , with the handle handed towards has created another dog , has imbriefly to the banknake , hit on the bankners .
We want to talk about cavarsely with anything ?
In the Canadies , 1999 government government has replied to the total control of a territory of a larger area of California and Texas .
It 's their new patria new patria .
It 's an independent term . They all control resources .
One splendido example of how a nation-state can remember with his people .
And , to finish , I think it 's pretty obvious at least at at least who of us was in these high zones of the planet , remote that they 're not at remote .
For somebody is home .
They represent sections of human imagination that are represent to the high humans . And for us all , the dreams of these kids , as the dreams of of children , becomes part of the swezing of hope .
And finally , we have National Geographic we are convinced that politicians will never get to nothing .
We believe polemiics --
[ Applausi ] no persuasive , but we believe that stories can change the world , and maybe we 're the best institution to tell the stories of the world . Every month , our site is 35 million lives .
156 countries transmit our television canal .
Our re-laughed millions of people .
Our work is travel in etnosphere to bring our audience in a place of wonders of cultural wonders , that will be able to get away from how they saw and hopefully huge , will be good for the central revealed of the central anthropology , the world 's going to be in a pluralistic and multicultural world
where the wisdom of all popular people can contributing to our collective well-being .
Thank you .
I 'm going to talk about some things I wrote in this book that I hope you 're already heard and try to evidence some links , in case not known them .
I 'd like to start with what I call " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " The dogma dogma dogma dogma . "
The dogma official dogma of what ?
The dogma official dogma of all industrial society , the dogma official dogen : " If we want to male the wealth of our citizens . " The way to do is massive liberty the individual freedom . "
The reason is , from a hand , in the fact that freedom is in itself a value , useful , is precious , useful , essential for humans .
And the other is that if we 're free , each of us can act for all of us can act for all that massive though our well-being , no one that decided in our well-being .
The way to massive freedom is massive freedom .
More choice people , more than people have , more , and more than they are well-being .
This , I think , it 's so deeply radicated in society that nobody would dream of of a doubt .
And it 's also deeply radical in our lives .
I 'll show you some examples of what progress has made possible .
This is my supermarket . It 's not particularly great .
I 'm a very simple note about condition .
In my supermarket , there are 175 conditivast , without contact 10 oil and oil varieties of oil , and 12 acetes , and the 12 acetes , and the 12 bags , and it 's well-condition in the crowd circumstance that no one of 175 , already ready ready ready ready for your degree .
That 's what supermarket .
Then you go to the electronics stereo to buy a stereo : CD , lector , radio , the CD , radio , plag , piece .
And in this single electronics , there 's a big audio components .
We can do six million and a half million a combinations of the components that there are only in one negoties in .
You have to admit that there 's a lot of choice .
Other the sorts : the world of communications .
And once I was a child , they could get all the phone services the phone services , to the bat that they were provided by mom Bell .
And it was the phone , they didn 't buy it .
A consequence of that , between the phone was that the phone never break .
These days went .
We have a variety of phones , especially in the phones , especially between the phones .
Here 's the cell phones of the future .
My favorite is the middle in the middle , the nose of the nose , and the holds for the crash .
If you haven 't seen it in the negotie in the house , you 're going to be able to be .
And what happens is that people enters in the negozes in and ago this question . And you know , what ? The answer is , " No . "
It 's not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn 't do too much .
So , in other aspects of life that are much more important than the bugs of the holds of the path of choices .
Auananitarian : It doesn 't happen in the United States that you can go from doctor and doctor , you have to do .
Instead , I walk from doctor , and doctor says , " OK , we can do A , or B , " A , " Boy , " A has these benefits and these risks , " B , " B has these benefits and these risks . What do you want to do ? "
You say , " Doctor , what should I do ? "
And the doctor says , " A has these benefits and these risk , and B has these benefits and these sauce . "
" What do you want to do ? "
And you can rebate , " Doctor if she was me , what would you do ? "
And the doctor : " But I 'm not her . "
The result , we call it the malate autonomy of the malancing , expression that makes it look like a great thing .
But it 's not that a move the weight and the responsibility of taking somebody knows , is the doctor , to somebody else knows anything -- and almost of you know -- and almost certainly is sick -- and it 's not in ideal condition to take the patient .
There 's a huge marketing products , direct people , direct to people like me and you , that if you don 't think about it , because we can 't buy them .
But if we can 't buy them , why we have publishing them ?
The answer is that they want to doctor to ask the doctor for you to get to change the recipe .
Something that is the fundamental as our identity is a question of choice , as you see in this vignize , " We don 't want to force children to be . " We don 't want to be a heradly , we have to do that . "
And we can reinventing how many times we get us .
which means that every morning , at the morning , you have to decide that kind of person wants to be .
I 'm going to be walked to the family and marriage , a common time , in the common it was that they marriage us the most possible , and it was that they sent the most possible possible , and it was that it was that you can .
The only real choice was with who , not when , and not even what to do after .
And it 's really to play .
I teach very smart students , and I do 20 percent of work than a time .
And not because they 're bright now , not because they 're wealthy .
but why are they impensierites , intent to ask , " Would I be married or not ? "
" Would I be thinking about it ? "
They 're interrogorananants .
And they try to answer these questions , even if this implies not to be completely to get a beautiful vote to my own .
And they have to do it . They 're important .
Now , the work : we 're lucky , like Carl underlucky , because technology allows us to work every day , every day , from every corner of the planet , except that from the Hotel Randolandolic .
And in parently , there 's a corner , and I wouldn 't tell anybody where , WiFi .
I don 't tell you , because I want to use it .
What does this incredible freedom of choice that we have about work ? Is we have to work ? Is we have to work or not .
We can go to see our son and toy , with the cell phone in a bank , Blackberry in the other , and the notetexten , on the ginneights .
And even though they are all spent , every minute that we see our baby , we 're also asking the game , " Do you say , " Do you say , " Do you say , " Do you know , " Do you know , " Do you see that called ? "
" Do I have to say this email ? "
And even when the answer is no , " all this makes the experience of your child , very different than what would be in other conditions .
So , from any part of the one of the little bit , and big materials , and life , life , life is a question of choices .
The world was this : this is : That 's what it was . But it wasn 't a question of choice .
The world today looks like this : The dilemma is , " Is it a good thing , or negative ? "
The answer is , the Sholding .
The positive hundred slide , so I 'm going to talk about the negative ones .
And all this choice compelling two effects of people .
The first one , paradoxically , is that produces instead of liberation .
With a lot of options in which choose , it becomes very difficult to do .
I 'm offered you a meaning : a company is a volunteer plans of volunteer .
A link of my link data in Vancivvanoil , the gigantic society , with about a million clients of employees in 2000 different companies .
What she found is that for every 10 solutions that are being offered in more , the percentage of adesion , the lower two percent .
With 50 sourcing funds , there 's 10 percent of adesions than when they 're available . Why are they only five to five to them . Why ?
Because with 50 funds of the floor , is sick , it 's sick to decide , and choice is to go back to the inmorrow .
And I 'm asking , and I still questions , questions , and , of course , tomorrow .
You know it doesn 't mean just that these workers are going to be missing food for dogs because they 're not going to have enough money , want to say that the decision is that they lose the decision is so hostics that they are almost complementary of the work .
Not participating , they 're losing to five to 1,000 dollars for the year from the work dator of work , which would be ben up .
So the paralysis a consequence of having too many choices .
And I think it makes the world .
" And to finish , for eternity : ketchup , or maionese ? "
You want to take the right decision , if it 's for ethernity , right ?
You don 't want to choose the bottom , and neighbored , and not the wrong condition .
So this is the first effect . The second one is that we can avoid paralysis , and do a choice , we 're less satisfied by the result of how we would be with less options of how we would be with less options of what we would choose .
And that 's several reasons .
One of these is that with many condless condless condition . And it 's not perfect , it 's very easy , it 's not perfect , it 's easy to imagine that you could do a different choice that would be better . And what happens is that the alternative imagined us industry , and the diminished the decision of the path , and it diminished the decision ,
And even when it was a great decision .
More choice is easy to be displeasant than any detail that 's insod-called choice .
And there is what economists call constantly opportunity .
Dan Gilbert asked very well as a value of the value that we 're depends on what we 're comparison .
And the rest , when there are many options , it 's easy to represent the characteristics of the alternative , and be less satisfacts of the option that 's choice .
So , here 's an example . I shape all the people who are not New York .
But that 's what you probably think .
There 's this couple to the Hamptons .
a place of lurther .
It 's beautiful . It 's all about it . It 's all for them .
Not nothing . But what he thinks is , it 's August . "
" All my neighbors in Manhattan is away . "
" I could talk about the front of home . "
And it spend two weeks , from the idea that 's losing -- every day -- the possibility of parking things where it wants .
The constantly opportunity is decreases the satisfaction for what we have , even when choice was excellent .
And more the options we have to look at , the more the characteristics that attractive will be back as expensive opportunity .
Here 's another example .
This vignized us a lot of things .
It 's about living the moment , and maybe living slowly .
But the most important point is that any thing you choose , you 're choose , you 're not going to do the other .
The things that we don 't choose have a tremendous attractive what we do .
Third point : : The growth of expectations .
I tried it on my skin skin .
I 'm almost always jeans .
Once the jeans were just like , they bought them and bestivestia were modied , only after having them a life and wasn 't been pleased , and they were going to go well .
So , I went to buy a new one when the old those old old old , and I said , " I need a couple of jeans , this is my cutter . "
And he said , " He wants to me slim fit , easy fit , relaxed fit ? "
And he wants to them with cernightons ? " Stonewashed , " or " acidwashed ? "
" Does it wants ? "
" Sotto take them , holds or handle ? Bash blah .
I was sleep , and after a while I was able to say , " I want the guy that was the only kind of , " -- which was the only one of the time , so , for a time , I tried to all the sick , I went out of the most of the jeans , I would come out of the jeans that I 've ever had .
It was the massive . And all that choice I had got the best .
But I was worse .
Why ? I wrote a whole book to understand it .
The reason I was worse about is that with all the aspectops were very high , jeans had to be perfect .
I had expectations of mines . I didn 't expect any excited when it was only a guy , but when it was only a kind of a kind of , but when it was alizing 100 different , at least one kind of had to be perfect .
What I had bought was good , but not perfect .
After compared that chosen with what I was trying to be insatisfied in the expectations .
The addition of options in the life does not make people that increase the expectations that have respect to the options of the same options .
And this will be less satisfy , even when the results are good .
No one in the marketing world in marketing .
Because if they knew it , you wouldn 't know what I 'm talking about .
The truth more like this .
" You 'd better when it was worse , " The reason it was better when it was worse was worse , it was that when it was worse was worse yet possible to meet .
And the world , in the world that we live -- opulent , industrialized citizens with the expectancy of perfeet -- the massive we can hope is that things are at the height of expectations .
You never have surprised surprised because your expectations , the myself , the myself is ingigantic .
The secret of happiness -- what you 're here -- is , " Basse , " Yes , " Yes , you want . "
I mean , little autobiographic moment -- which I 'm really married and my wife is really amazing .
I couldn 't have done better , I didn 't have accounted .
But it 's not always a bad thing .
And then , a consequence of the comprare a couple of jeans when there is only that when you 're not satisfied , and you 're asking you , " Why ? "
" Who is responsible ? "
The world is responsible . What can I do you do ?
When there are hundreds of kinds of kinds of kinds of kinds of kinds of kinds of kinds of kinds of kinds of kinds of kinds of kinds of kinds of kinds of kinds of kinds of kinds of kinds of kinds of kinds of kinds of kinds of kinds of jeans , and you 're going
You 'd have been doing better .
With hundreds of available variety , there are no scape for the insuccess .
So when people get decisions , even if the result is , they feel in the result is , they 're walking up and give the hit to them hit .
In the last few years , the depression is exploded in the industrialized world .
I think a significant factor -- not the only one , but important -- of this depression of depression is just that people have deludgments because the standards are too high .
And when they have to explain this situation think that hit is their hit .
So the final result is that we 're better , and we 're better , and we hear worse .
Let me remember .
This is the official dogma , what we all take for good and it 's completely fake . It 's not true .
There 's no doubt that a little bit of choice is better than having at all , but from this doesn 't have any hard choice is better than having a little bit .
There 's a critical value , magic . I don 't know what it is .
But I 'm sure we 've superted by a piece of the level where the choices are better than our life .
Now , from the political point -- I 've got a political point -- I 've got up -- from political point of view , the nice .
What 's all this choice that allows all this choice in industrial society is material .
There are many places in the world , and you know about it a lot of places in the world , is not that they have too much choice .
The problem is that they have too a little bit .
So the faces that I 'm talking about is a while modern exercise of modern , remember society .
And what it does mad and arrage is this : Steve Levitt talked about yesterday about how those expensive and cocococococococococococococobs for bombs are inuuuuseful .
I mean these choices , complicated and dispendispendious , it 's not just inured .
They 're in deleteries .
They do it stay worse .
If a little bit of what we in our society allows choice was reversed in those where people have too few possibilities , it would not only be the lives , it would be better .
This is what economists call a paretian improvement .
A redistribution of the income , it 's good at all -- not only to the poor -- because of this choice in a excess that it comes back us .
And to conclude , " Fick , you can become everything that you want , "
You , people are about culture , you think , " What does it do it do ? "
" It 's obvious that you can 't get anything in a glass . "
" A castrated imagination , a limited vision of the world
and that 's what I 've interpreted it so , at the beginning .
But then , I realized , instead , I realized that weight the long-gareas .
Because the reality of fact is that if you send to the boat the boat , so that it 's possible , " you don 't get the freedom . You get the paralysis . You get the paralysis .
If you break the bock , so that all you can diminuitous satisfaction .
You 're going to get the paralysis , and you 'll reduced well-being .
Everybody needs a sphere .
This is almost certainly too , maybe for fish , and even for fish , and certainly for us .
But the absence of a sphere is a recipe for infection and , for the roin the roin .
Thank you very much .
