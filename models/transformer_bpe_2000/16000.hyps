The year I showed these slide slide to show that the glacial glacial , which is almost three million years of the United States , and it 's record of the United States continental , it 's recently 40 percent .
But this subjected , this is not showing the problem because it doesn 't show the ice of the ice .
The artics of the artics is , in a sense , the heart of global climate system .
It 's winside and you get sumer and you get sumer .
The next slide is a fairly raised on the last 25 years .
The ice lost of gaiaces are drawn in red .
You see , you see , you 're going to the blue .
That 's the ice in the winter inverny , which is summer .
You can see that the ice ice ice ice ice ice , five years or more , is like the sangue , which is like the blood , which is like the blood , which is like the blood .
In 25 years , it 's spent from so ,
This is a problem because the whole scale is the whole land of the ice ice ice , and it 's a lot of carbon conglacier , where there are huge amount of coal conglacier , they 're turning to turn from microbes .
I 'm going to spect to be a global warming warming , that amount of global atmosphere , that amount could be , superperatent this point of not .
In some laghes in Alaska meter 's already rebulating the water .
The professoresse Katey Walter of the University of Alaska , a team taka team crownery .
Wow ! Al Gore : Wow ! Al Gore : Lake 's good .
A reason is that this termal exament that this termal exament of Greenland from the northermal .
This is a fiume in the regime .
The brought it had never reached .
This is the Kangerlussuaq , in the west sud-west west of Greenland .
If you want to know how the level of the sea level of walking on the ice , here is where you can add the sea .
These corrents are increasing rapidly .
Another the planet : Antarcttartttttarian of the planet .
The month is the month have dichise that the gaiacious is in negative , and that the Antarctarctarcttarcttarctttarly , it 's particularly rapid , is particularly rapid in the snice .
Equival at six meters of the acious , as Greenland .
Sull Himalayas the third of ice ice , you see new glaghes , and they 're going to see new laghes , who were drier .
The 40 percent of the world population was half of the water as a spopulation .
Sulle Ande : this ice ice is the source of the water water .
The brought it is increased .
But when it diminuges , the same happens to the water .
In California , the Nevada is diminuity of the Nevada is diminuity of 40 percent .
The ydrogen are in crisis .
The predictions , like you 've read , I 'm graves .
The growth in the world door to a night in the world leads .
The environmental disstrange are increasing out of the normal and without previous .
It 's a more numerous numerous than 75 years .
This is a whole thing is a sustainable .
If you look in the context , if you can see the consequences .
We 've added 70 million tons of tons of CO2 , every 24 hours -- 25 million tons in the ocean every day .
Look attentily the East area of the East Pacific , from the American , and both west west parts of the Indian , where there 's a radical impoverty , where there 's a radical imor in the oceans .
The most causes of global warming , together to the deforestation , which is the 20 percent , is the use of fuel .
The oil is a problem , and carbon is even worse .
The United States are one of the two countries with China .
And it 's proposed to build a lot of other coal carbon .
But we 're going to a change of direction .
These are the annoced projects in the last few years and some propose alternative versus .
And every way , there 's a lot of politics in our country .
The coal industries of coal and oil have spent 250 million dollars in the last year to promote coal coal , which is a obsimly .
And this picture I remember something --
I 'm going to see Natale , in Tennessee , where I live , there was a loss of 3.8 billion literally .
Maybe you saw it on the news .
This is the biggest flow of scories in America .
It happened around Natale .
The publicity of one of the coal industries was this .
Video : World Weat the cooking , is a kind of allegro and happy .
It 's abundant here in America , and it 's growing our economy .
Frosty coal is always more and more .
It 's a good , adorable , and the workers are hard .
Al Gore : Da is a lot of West Virginia .
The greatest society is Massey Coal , is Massey Coal . This is his administrator .
Don Blankening : Don Blankenship : I 'm going to be a -- Al Gore , Nancy Pelosi , they don 't know what they 're talking about .
Al Gore : So the Alleance for the Clima has launched two campaiged campaiged two campaiged campaiged .
This is a part of it , one part .
Video : Actor : All the COLergy see the climate change like a threat the crowds to our business .
So , our priority is investing a great amount of money in a such advertising to make public and confused the truth on carbon .
It 's actually not sport .
We think it 's not lit -- it 's also a good .
So not preocupateves of climate change .
Let 's do about us .
Video : Carbone , you 've heard a lot of -- you have heard very .
So , you 're a job in a clear structure at the heads , as it 's about coal .
Straordinary ! The machines are a little rumorose , but this is the sound of coal technology .
The coal consumption is between the main global warming , but the global night , but the nice remarkable technology that you see changes everything .
You 're a look : this is the coal technology of coal clean .
Al Gore : Infinally , the alternative positive is connected to economic economic question and the national security .
Video : Comvalent America is in cribe ; the national security , national crisis .
The fallenge that the college is : our dependence on the fuel , like coal coal and oil .
Now , there 's a new , audent , it 's a new , car solution for using .
Repower : 100 percent of clean energy , in 10 years .
A plan to reput America to work in the work , make sure sure , and help us stop global warming .
Finally , a solution that bake our problems .
Repower . Scook .
Al Gore : This is the last .
Video : It 's about required to America .
One of the fastest ways to take the end of the fastern combustible that kills our planet .
What 's the future is here . Where . By , only one , a new energy .
What a few : Novi investment for places of bad work for bad .
Coming : Repower . It 's time to be realists .
Al Gore : A old afran African says , " If you want to go fast , you go to the fast .
If you want to go away , you go together . "
We have to go away , speaking .
Thank you very much .
The year year at TED phect-introduction in the LHC .
And I promise to travel to enjoy you about how the machine .
So , I 'm here . And for the other time , there were no , LHC is the largest scientific experiment ever -- 27 kilometers of circles .
His a task is to remember the conditions that were less than a billion second on the beginning of the universe -- until 600 million times a second .
All of this is just environment .
This is the Ginevra .
We 're pictures these mini-Big Bang Big Bang Big Bang Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Big Bang in the record .
This is what I work . It 's called ATLAS -- it 's largely 44 feet and has a 22 meters .
This is a spectacular picture of ATLAS in building so you can see the proportions .
The 10 September year we have acceso the machine for the first time .
And this picture was taken by ATLAS .
It 's because of the immense of the control .
It 's a picture of the first phasm of the particles that had done everything the LHC , both into collision , with a part of the LHC , and spread particles in the labeled .
In other words , when we see that the 10 september 10 tember , we understand that machine work , which is a big vitty .
I don 't know if it was this to do us more or that , when somebody went on Google and saw that the beginning page was this .
That means we have a cultural impact beyond that scientific .
It 's a week after , there was a problem with the machine , had to these floor here -- these floor here -- these dored drugs .
These files are 13,000 prints when the machine works at the massive .
Now , the technical is of you look at the flows and say , " It 's not true . They 're too sound . "
And instead they can do that when they 're very cold switch .
So , at less 271 degrees , at a temperature in the room , these fallen files can bring that corrent .
In one of the juntures of the most naked the magnets in LHC , there was a fect-feck .
So the files are going to be slightly , and 13,000 printed a electrical resistance .
This was the result .
Now , this is more impressive if you think that these magnets more than 20 tons , and that you have been about 30 centimeters .
They 're damaged about 50 magnets .
We had to take them , what we had done .
We have repristined and traveled .
Now , they 're returning all the ground .
By the end of the LHC is is going to be again .
We 're going to get this , and we 're going to get data to right now or lights , and we continue to find what the adventure to discover what are the morning .
Now , of course , in a certain way , these accidents reaccess to the value of science and engineering and engineering . It 's easy to confect .
I think the fact that it 's so difficult , I think it 's the value of the things like LHC .
I 'd like to conclude with the words of a Inglese scientist , Humphrey Davy , which , I imagine , in the inuseful experiments of his puplease , his pupleasure was Michael Faraday , he said , " Nient is a very dangerous for the reences of the ideas of science is , which is not to our new ideas , which is about about our ideas , and we have to have been in the souldn 't have to be in the new monkey , and that we have to be in the new word .
Thank you .
I want to start to ask you to think about when , children , da , play cover , played with them .
And so you can see how to reach them and you 're going to take them and move them , and you learn about and moving them , and you learn about , and they 're going to relationships .
The pace is deeply connected to the way we understand the way we understand free part of the world around us .
So , from the information of our own own own own physical objects , with physical objects , and my consult Jeevan Kalanii Kalanii , and I started asking a computer , and when we use a computer , instead of a computer , instead of have the both of the mouse as a digital chicket that is on a desktop of the digital , we could have a furnership with a desktop ,
and we 're going to sistemareas ?
The question was so interesting that we decided to explore the answer , building the answer , building the answer , and I building the answer .
In a few words , a Siftable computer is a big computer as a bicooker .
In a few words , a Siftable computer is a big computer as a bicooker .
You can move with your hand , they can see it , " You can see the movement and they have a screen and they have a rawireless .
But it 's basically , I 'm physical objects , you can move simply floor .
Siftable is of a new ecosystem tools to manipulate information .
And as they get more physical , conscious , of others , and as they get more physical , and they get more physical , of others , and we can explore new nice and different style and different style .
I 'm going to do with some simple example .
This Siftable is configured to show video : if you 're in a direction , the video rowner , if you 're going to the other side .
These ritrats are conscious knowledge of others .
If you 're going to do it , you 're interested in what is their around .
If they 're circles , they 're going to be a little bit .
If they 're circles , they 're going to be a little bit .
They also have their movement and inclination .
We have realized that one of the interesting implications of the interaction was the power of the interaction was the power , to you know , " a color like it was a liquid .
In this case , we have three Siftable configured as sector and I can use them to the color in the central color in the central , where they 're missing .
and I can use them to talk about the color in the central color that they 're missing .
If we 're too much , we can put a little bit about it .
You also see the possible possibility of apprint , like languages , the mathematics and logic and logical logical things where people can try things fast fast things fast , and see the result result .
I 'm now --
This is a Fibonacks that I do with a equations of equations .
Here we have a toy of words that is half between Scarabean and Boggle .
Pratically , at every turn a letter in an case on every Siften , Pratically , every turn out , at every turn a letter on every Siftable , and while you 're trying to buying him on a diptionary .
Then , after about 30 seconds , and you have a new set of lect-iny lecting and a new set of a chance to try .
Thank you .
Here 's children came in the gone to the Media Lab , I did it and I 've been able to try and video .
They 're very , very much .
And one of the interesting things about this application is that you don 't have to give people many instructions .
You have to say , " What about the words , " and they know what to do .
Here 's other people who try it .
This is our younger head , right there .
He actually wanted to impiling them .
They were only onces , for him .
Now , this is a card of a card interactive application .
We wanted to build a tool for the apprint of the languages is Felix .
It can insert new characters in the scene , solving Siften , they 're associated .
It can insert new characters in the scene , solving Siften , they 're associated .
That 's doing the sun .
Video : The sun is .
David Merrill : Now he took a tractor in the scene .
Video : The tractor .
Bel ! Yeah ! Yes !
So I 'm going to Siftable and put them neighbors can interact the characters --
Video : Bau !
-- inventing their story .
Video : Ciao !
DM : It 's a window , and it can decide him how you 're svolves .
DM : It 's a window , and it can decide him how you 're svolves .
Video : Voly : Voly .
DM : The last example I have the last example of show you is a tool , realized , to walk and to walk and exequal music .
It 's a tool , realized , to walk and exef music .
Siftable here , and the bacteria .
Each one of these has four different variations , and you can choose what to use .
You can insert these sound in a sequence to your feeling to be comporse .
And it just four-like a suund , " and a " sequence . "
These are actually actually , you can control from vive , like the reverbs and the filter .
You attacks to a particular sound and then including it .
And then there are the general effects like time and fly , and you 're going to the whole sequence .
We look like it works .
DM : DM : We 're going to put a base in two Siften Siftable , we 're going to the other thing , we add the other base .
Now I put a low line line .
DM : DM : Now I add of the percussions --
DM : And I 'm going to put the bacteria , so I can control the battery , so I can control the effect from vive .
DM : DM : DM : DM : DM : DM : I can 't know the time from a moon or the other .
DM : And I 'm going to add the fabulous philtro to give more expression .
DM : DM : DM : DM : I can fight the flight . "
So I wouldn 't have to plan , but I can improvement , and it 's longer or more corta .
And now , finally , I can fall the sequence inclinding the whole sequence .
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is to build new interface , and more and more and more and more and the way .
And today , I had time to show you one of the result of this lost , and also some possibility we try to bring out from the lab .
The concept that I want to transmitted is that 's coming this new generation of objects to interact with digital media , which will bring information in our world , in the way we want .
Thank you very much .
I don 't see the time to talk to all of you .
I 'm a writing .
I 'm write books is my profession , and it 's more than that , of course .
It 's also the love and my life .
And I don 't expect that can change .
But , I said , something particular happened in my life and my career , which has taken me to remember the whole whole thing .
The particular thing is I recently wrote this book , this biography called Manogy , Prega , Prega , " What , a fun , I 'm a fun , for some reason it , for some reason it , for some reason it , and it becomes a big , bseller , bseller .
And the result is that everywhere in the road is that everywhere I was condamn .
Day is -- condanned , condanned .
They 're going to me now all worry and they say , " Don 't you get more than to be able to do better ?
You don 't have to be writing for all life without more being able to create a book that can be able to create a book that can 't be able to somebody ? "
that can be important ? "
It 's rassure , you know .
But it might be worse , I remember that more than 20 years ago , when I began to say to the people -- I was a adolescent -- I was a writing .
I was going to meet the same reaction .
And people said , " Don 't have succeeded ?
Don 't you fear that the umiliation of killation ?
You don 't have to be able to be a whole life without the wait , and you 're going to die on a coat of a standle of fallies with the both bouth of fallipallissis to fallisation ? "
So , you know .
The answer -- the answer to all these questions is , " Yes . "
Yes , I have a fear of all of things .
I always had a fear of it .
And I also have a lot of other things that people could not have to be .
How the algae and other things .
But how about the writing what I thought and I was going to ask me , and I was going to ask me , why ?
Is it rational ?
It 's logical that anyone has to be spaper to be spaper for a job that you 've been born to do .
But what 's about this particular , creative impressed to make us nervous about health health health in a way that other caring ?
How my father , for example , he was a chemistry and I don 't remember of a time in his 40 years of activity where he was asked if she had fear to be engineer ?
It was never -- that blob of the engineer of the engineer John , how did it ?
Don 't work like this , you know ?
Onestly , engineers like group , chemical engineers don 't certainly , in the reputation of being hand-hand-hand-hand-hand-a-hand-depressed .
We have a little bit of this reputation , and not just writers , but creative reputation of every gender , we have this reputation of being huge instable to be hustable .
And it 's not the other than you 're looking at the sad of the magnificence of the magnificence , only in the ventesimum century , they died young and often to them .
And the ones that they 're not suicipate data , they 're actually discovered by their dons .
Norman Mailer , before I die , in the last interview said , " Ogain my book has killer ky a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of the work .
But we don 't bad at the time we feel that we 've heard these things , so long that we 've heard these things , we 've completely interized and accepted the notion that creativity and the art , it 's going to be some way and art , will will be somehow , and it will will be a little bit and art , will will be able to be in the angoes to .
And the question I want to take all of the today is : You 're about this idea ?
It 's good this thing -- because you also look at the time , because it 's not good for anything about this supposed .
I think it 's odioxious .
And I think it 's also dangerous and I don 't want to see it perpetuated in the next century .
I think it 's better encourage our big creative minds .
And I 'm sure that , in my case -- it would be very dangerous to start fire out of the hear that I was going to start fire in the purpose that I 'm in my career .
That 's a little -- introduced , I 'm quite young , I 'm just about 40 years .
I still have about four decades of work in me .
And it 's very likely to be what I 'm going to write about now , and then it will be judged by the way , I was going to my last book .
I 'm going to be slavery , because we 're all the love here -- it 's likely to my home .
Oh , Gesus , who thought .
You know that 's the kind of thinking that leads a person to start to get a person in the morning and I don 't want to do it .
I would keep to keep this work that we love .
So , the question is , how ?
And so it seems , after many reflections , which the way to work to keep is to write is to create a psychological costraisize , right ?
I have to have a few way to find a security between me , which I 'm writing , and my natural anxial , which I 'm going to get to . And , as I was trying to go to this . And , as I was going to look through the time , and I 'm going to look through the time , looking at the time , looking at the time , looking at the time , and yet .
about how to help people create creative to make the risks of creativity .
And that 's taken me to the ancient Great and the Rome .
I 'm going to guitem because it was in circle and then back .
Nelt Great and ancient Rome -- people didn 't seem to believe that creativity came from from men , OK ?
It was thought that creativity was this spirit about the injumped and that came to a few men from a few surprising and switch , for reasons and known .
The greehouse called the creativity of creativity " demons .
Socrate , wonderful , it was created to have a demon that elargives wisdom from landwisdom .
The Romanied were the same idea , but they call that kind of spirit .
The huge is great , because the Romanes didn 't really think that a genius was somebody particularly smart .
They realized that a genius was this kind of entity divine that you created living in the walls of a artist , a little bit like the elfo Dobby , and that came out to to be able to high the work of the artist of the work and model of that work .
It 's a pattern -- here is the distance of which I talk about -- that psychological costrators that you protect you from your work .
And everybody knew that was so that it worked , right ?
So the antient artists were protect from certain things , like for example , how to the too narcism , right ?
If your work was except that you couldn 't take all the merit , all of the merit , all had been helped by this genius .
If your fallide , it wasn 't all your flip , right ?
They all know that was your genius to be a incapable .
And so the people han concept creativity in Occident for a long time .
Then Rencing came up and all of this , and nacive this big idea ; we put the human being in the center of the universe , and the midddle and the mistery and without more and writing space to the devate with the divinity .
This was the major of the rational humanity and people started thinking that creativity came up with the idivide .
And for the first time in history , you start to referred to this or that artist like a rather like a rather that one person with a person in the person .
And I have to say , I think that was a big herror .
I think that allow someone , a simple person to believe that as a recipent as a recipent as the source , and the source of all the divines , inosconcercipes , inosconcert , inosconnected to the fragile psyches .
It 's like to someone to ingoes to ingoes .
Deform and distores completely the ego and creates all of these indestores on performance .
And I think it was this pression to have the articulated artists in the past 500 years .
And if that 's true , and I think that is , and I think that is , and now ?
Can we do it fun ?
Maybe a more , to a more ancient understanding of human relationship and measurement .
Or maybe not .
Maybe we can 't sell 500 years of rational thinking in a talk about 18 minutes .
And there 's probably people between the audience that would be lawy-suspects , insospects that they do people , unsometimes that follow people to spend their projects .
I 'm not going to convince you all about this thing .
But the question I would like to take is -- why not ?
Why don 't think about this way ?
Because it 's more than any other thing that ever ever heard to explain the exaspering imprevebility of creative process .
A process that , as anyone who ever ever have tented to do something -- so , all here , all of course , you know , you don 't buy .
And , in fact , it can sometimes seemed to be very paranormal .
I did this met recently with the extraordinary poetesse Rutone , who has been a poethesis , but it was a poetesse for all life and said he during his childhood in the Virginia , and he fellow it , in the writing field , when a poem was out of the landscape .
He said that was like a fragorous track of air .
And that was rotoling towards her landscape .
It was to feel , because he was so much like it .
He had a only thing to have a only thing to do at that point and it was , " corrate like a major . "
And so it was going to come back and come from this poem , and it wouldn 't have to get a piece of paper and a craft and a math and a math , and a math , and he wouldn 't collect it on the page .
Sometimes they couldn 't be fast enough , so he was , and he was walked and wait and wait was going to be in home and the poem was going through and she would go through the landscape through the landscape , and he would go through the landscape . "
Then there were those times -- this piece of the time -- this piece of the time , there were the moments where it was almost losed , OK ?
So , he was corring home and he was looking at the paper and willing the past and willing the past , and then he was going to a wait , and then he said , that was like if you 're sitting with the other hand and the waste .
He was the poem of the coda and he was reput it into his body and turn into his body and turn on the page .
And in these cases , the poem is going to be perfect page and intention , but the last word at the first .
So when I felt it -- it 's crazy , it 's exactly equal to my creative process .
I 'm not a condition of -- I 'm not a condition .
I 'm a music , and my way to work is ; it 's a way to see me at the same orary every day and I 'm going to work and go and go and go and pass .
But even I 'm just in my head , I 've striked against that thing , sometimes .
And I 'm imagine that many of you have the han .
You know , even if the job and ideas came to me from a certain courselves , you can 't have to be undly .
And what is this thing ?
And how can we relationship to the way we don 't lose to lose , but , rather , what does it do you get to sani ?
And so , as I think , the best contemporary example I have is the Mr. Waits , which I interviewed in a day .
We were talking about this , and you know , Tom , for most life was the incarnation of the life was the incarnation of the town , trying to control these species of creatives , to control these species of inhorized inhycity .
But then I 'm invited , you know , and a day as she was driving on a car at Los Angeles , changed everything for him .
It was going to be fast fast and all of a trackle momelodia , which is going to the inspiration , and it 's willing , and it wants , you know , it 's wonderful , and it 's width , and it 's not known as you take it .
It 's not a piece of paper , it has not a math , it has no register .
So , it began to feel this kind of old anxial anxide , " I 'm going to lose , and I 'm going to slexioned by this song .
I 'm not enough and I can 't do it . "
And instead of go in the panic , you stop .
I 'm going to put the whole whole new process and made something new .
I 'm going to look at the sky and said , " Scuses , I wake that I 'm driving ? "
" To you know , " Who can write a song hour ?
If you really want to be , you 're going to be more opported when I can take me you .
Altherwise , you 're going to important someone today .
You 're going to disturbing Leonard Cohen . "
And his process , he worked after this .
I don 't work , the job was still known like .
But the process , and the fish that was remained when the genius , the genius , the genius that was caused to him to be the other problems and fliberated it to remained , and he remained .
but it 's just a peculiar , wonderful bizarre collaboration between Tom and this thing and this strange and this thing that although , and he wasn 't Tom .
So how the story I was going to change a little bit of the way I was working , and I was going to save me a time .
This idea , I was going to writing , " Manogy , Prega , Ama , " and I add in one of the disperation where we 're going to do all when we 're working on something and we can 't start thinking that it will be a worse , and we can 't start thinking that it will be a worst , which is going to be a worse .
Not just bad , just the worst book .
And I started thinking about gap this project .
But then I remember of Tom who speaking at the air and try .
So I zoom my face in the writing and deresses my waves to a vacacuum .
And I said , " Sents , " Sents , what 's going to be a little bit of it will not be brilliant not be my , right ?
Because as I 'm going to put all I 'm put all that I don 't have more than that .
So if you want it to be better , you have to presented and make your part .
Okay . But if you don 't do it , you know , I don 't do it .
I 'm going to writing the same because it 's my job .
And I want to do it for me to do my part of my part of my part of my part of my part , " Because , at the end is so , OK -- secoli does in the deserts of Africa 's North people were running for the key to the key , dances of the lawyers and willing and waiting .
And they always were magnific , because the ballerini were professionals and they were great .
But every one one of them , something happened , and one of these artists was actually transendent .
And I know what I 'm talking about , because I know you have seen , at a certain point , a lost so .
It was like the time you stop , and the ballery walked through a kind of walked through a kind of a brand , and he wasn 't going to fall .
And in suddenly , not appeared as a human .
But it 's happening in the winside and under the focused in the divinity .
And when this was , you have to drawing , people knew what was , they call it a name .
They had the hands and they began to cancer , " Allah , Allah , Allah , Allah , God . "
That 's God , you know .
Curious stories -- when More invades the Spain Spain , the Spain , I was this abitude with their own and the pronunce " Allah , Allah , Allah , Allah , " who can still hear in the run , " which you can hear in the corride .
In Spain , when a wait has done something impossible and magic , " Allah , " Allah , " Allah , " I was , " ununderstanding , " I was a God of God .
And it 's great because we need .
But the problem is the next day , for the ballery , when you wake up and discover that are the 11 of Marteddrive in Martedries and wake it 's not more .
It 's just a mortal with gran with ginocka , and maybe it will never be more to hear that alone .
And maybe anybody who will have the name of God still as it , and what 's going to do with the rest of his life ?
It 's hard .
This is one of the most pain to make a creative life .
But maybe it has to be so angosciant , if you can 't believe , introuble , that the most extraordinary expect of your being come from you to yourself .
But you just think that 's just going to you to do this , in the squisity of this squisity part of your life that you have to someone else when you 're going to somebody else when you 're finished .
And , you know , if we think it in this way .
And so I started thinking about , and it 's sure , and it 's sure , I thought for different months during the book that I 'm going to adversus , the dangerous , spent , spent , spent , I 'm going to the further on my grandfailed .
And what I have to keep me when I feel elected by this is , not aver .
Not to won 't go . It 's just your work .
It turns out to introduced your part , whatever can be .
If your work is balance , balance .
If the divine , assumed , I 'm going to make some kind of wonderful , for one moment through your sforce , for one moment through your sforced , then " Ole ! "
Altherwise , you do the same your dance .
And " Ole ! " You ! "
I think you 're dealt to teach it .
" Ole ! " You know , you just had a lot of human heart and test tells tal human-t-taken tal .
Thank you .
Thank you .
June Cohen : Ole !
And you know , I 've been talking about some of these projects on the human genome , what can meaning and discovery of new genes .
Now we 're beginning a new thing : we started digitalize biology and now we started to digitalize biology , we 're both in a new phase of biology , designing and we design and synthesize .
We always tried to bring big questions .
" What is life ? " It 's something that many biologists , I think they have tented to understand a livels .
We tried different approaches , reduced to minimes .
We 're digitalizing from almost 20 years .
When we have sequenced the human genome was going to spend from the analogical world of the computer world .
Now we 're asking : How do we regenerate life , or create new life from this digital ?
This is the map of a small organism , Mycoplasma genitalium , which is the smallest genitalium that can authorem in the lab .
And we tried to reduce the ulteriorminute one more small .
We 're able to eliminate a hundred genes of about 500 that I 'm here .
But when we go to his map metabolic metabolics , it 's relatively simple respect to our .
I think , this is simple .
But when we look at all the genes we can eliminate , one at the time , it 's very improbrought to a living .
So we decided that the only to provide that the only to provide this cromosome , so we can modify components to bring some of these questions .
And so we started the " Can we started the " Can we synthesize a cromosom ? "
It can be the chemistry to produce these big molecules that we never have been able to create before ?
And , in case , we can make a cromosom ?
A is just a piece of chemistry of chemistry .
The speakest we are able to digitalize life is growing to exponential life .
Our ability to write the genetic code , instead , instead , rather , but it 's improve .
And our most recent revenue to a exponential curve .
We 've been more than 15 years ago .
The process has required a lot of pass , beginning with a bioetic review before we began to the first experiments .
But we have found that DNA synthize that is very difficult .
There are thousands of a thousands of machines of DNA , long-50 letter , and it 's a segment process : more segment process : the segment is longer , the segment is longer , there are .
So we had to develop a new metodo for this slightly , and we have to fold the errors .
And this was our first test tattempt , to start information digital genome of Phi X 174 .
It 's a little virus that kills batters .
We designed the fragments , we actually have a recorruption of errors and get a lot of DNA of about 5,000 letter .
The interesting part is when we took this piece of chemistry of chemistry , and we put it in the bacteria , and we started to read this code and produring this genetic code and producing viral particles .
The viral particles have been releft by cells , they 're back and they 're back and they distrutt the Ecoli .
I 've talked about the recent of the oil industry , and I 'm talking about that they have certainly compressed this model .
They have more than you .
We believe that this is a situation where software can actually build his own own hardware in a biological system .
But we wanted to do things in the biggest things .
We wanted to build the whole cromosome of the bacteria .
I 'm more than 580 miles the lettes of code .
So we thought we 've thought about the seven of the virus of the virus , so that we could change the cell of what the components are of a cell .
The design is crucial , and if we start with digital information in a computer , these have to be very accurate .
When we sequenced this genome for the first time in 1995 , the accurateful accuratory for every 10 .
We found , resequence , 30 herrors . If we had used that original sequence , we would never be able to work .
It 's a part of the process is designing segments that have to have a lot of segments to all the other segments of 50 letter to build a little little bit more than 50 lectiny working together .
We 're going to be the only one here .
You probably have read that we 've read that we 're going to us about the floor .
Think of this : We have a code code on four lect-land-land-land-land-land-land-land-land-land-land-land-land-based code .
Three of those lect-hand codify about 20 minoacids , and there 's a specific order to have a lectal lecting every amminoes .
So we can use the genetic code to write words , framework , framework .
What we 've done in the beginning was self-doing this .
Some of the fact that they didn 't be a poem .
We designed these segments to just just just just to be a lot of injected .
There are there that are them and put them and put them together .
And we started asking about the parts , beginning with segments from five to segments , unending it in a way to form segments of 24 mile letter to be a segments to get to 72 .
We have these sequences in a lot of sequencing , so we 're trying to create a very very very much , so we 're trying to create a very very very robustood -- like you 'll see in a minute .
We 're looking for self-a-process .
So this seems the tabellon a basket .
When we 're going to be in these very long , more than 100 miles , more than 100 mila , they 're not going to grow more directly in Ecoli .
It 's going to the modern of the modern modern biology .
So we 've been looking at other mechanisms .
We knew of another mechanism called omologa , which is , in biology , which is using biology to pay DNA can une the segments .
Here 's an example .
This organism , called Deinococcus radioduring , it can absorbed three million radiation .
You can see in the sumer requarter as his cromosom .
In 12 -- 24 hours is absolutely .
There are thousands of organisms that are able to do .
These organisms can be completely seouble .
They can be a vacuum .
I 'm absolutely certainly the life in space , and you know , and you know , to find new environments of water .
And in fact , NASA has shown that this is .
This is a picture of the molecule that we 've built , just using these processes , just using the lights with the segments of segments to insert .
The light-light-huge .
This image was not taken with a microscopic electronic , but with a microscope .
It 's a lot of a lot of the big tremendous microscopic .
These are photograph that they 're a six seconds .
This is the publication we did a little time ago .
I 'm more than 580,000 lect-hand code .
It 's the greatest molecule of a defined structure ever created by man .
It 's a weight molecular weight at 300 million .
If we stammed with a careful attention , there would like 142 pages only to translate this code .
Now , how do we do it ?
Of course , a virus is a virus is a game .
It 's a little more complicated when they use the bacteria .
It 's also more simple when it is about euckariote as our : you can just extractly the nucleus and inserious one , which is basically the clonation .
In the bacteria , the battery is instead , instead is instead of instead , but we have recently demonstrated that we are able to make a transplant to a cell and activity .
We can refed a cromosom parting from a microbial species .
The two are different as the men of the topes .
We 've added some genes in the more than I could decide what I 'm going to choose for this cromosome .
The sciolentist with the way to kill all the proteins .
And when we put it in the cell was stupendoctor -- and you 'll open our graphical graphical -- the new cell cell cell .
And we were we thought we could not go beyond , but we have tried to spines more in there .
This is one of the major mechanisms of evolution .
We found that we 've found that very antime species have added a second or a third cromosom from a second thousands of tracts in a second thousands of tracts .
So who think about evolution as a gene at the evolution as a gene time , it doesn 't realized the biology .
There are a restription called " restription that advanced up digm that they 're digm in the DNA .
The cromosome that was in the cell of the cell is not a chance .
The cell phula-cell cromosome we have inserit-hand-cell .
It 's expressed , and has recognized the other chromosome as a material , has masticated , and we 're running with only the cell and the new cell cell .
It 's became blue because of the genes we have inserious .
And in a short least time , all the carteristics of a species are going to have lost , and it turned out of a new species , based on the new software we inserious software we inserious .
All the proteins are changed , the membranks are changed , and when we launched the equivalent cequivalent to what we have transfer .
Now , this might look allow genetics , but it 's going to software DNA , we can change things in a enough enough sustained .
Now , I 've been explained that here is not talking about genesis -- but a progress of the 10-year-old version of evolution , and I 've said that maybe we 're going to create a new version of Cambrian where they will be created a new version of the Cambrian where they 're going to create a new version of this process .
Why do that ?
I think it 's enough obvious when we think about our needs .
We 're going to spend six billion people in the next 40 years .
Right to give an example : I was born in 1946 .
Now there are three people on the planet for each other in 1946 ; there 's four years , and there will be four .
We 're having problems now to find food , fresh and clean and well-zero-billion and a half billion people .
It 's going to be more to do that for noine billion .
We 're more than five billion carbon carbon carbon , more than 30 billion baries of oil .
That means millions of baries a day .
When we 're trying to find biological processes , or whatever of process to reduce them , it will be a huge huge .
We have to keep the hemission of CO2 : from these materials that finished into the atmosphere .
Al day , thank you to scientific discovered in the world , we have a database with about 20 million genes , and I like to think they 're the designed for the future .
The electronic industry only only only a dozen dozen about components , and you think how many different things are coming out .
Our limits here are principlly data from the biological reality and our imagination .
Now we have the techniques , thanks to these metods of synthesization , and we can create what we call genomics genomics .
We 're able to build a big robot that can produce a million cromosomes a million cromosomes a day .
Think of these 20 million genes or different genes or different genes or to try to get optimize , and they 're going to make opten or drugs , we can change , thank , we can change , thank a little team , and create more biology , and create more biology .
And it 's just a standard selection .
We can choose for a chance of survive , chemical , or chemistry , production of waccine ,
This is a few of some software programmed on which we 're working to be able to seat and designing and design species to the computer .
Well , we don 't necessarily know how they will be .
We know what it is their genetic code .
Now we 're concentrating on the cooking couple of quarters .
You 've seen you that extract ethanol from grate was a finite experiment .
We have a lot of second and third generation that will use enough to coal zar carbon than the higher value , as the value , or different kinds of butanol .
But the only way the biology can have a big impact with without increase more impact with the cost of food and limited the dispon-cost , would be the CO2 in matter , so we 're working to design cells that we 're working to cells that they can reach this discovering , and we think we can get this disappeared in about 18 months .
The sunlight solar sunlight with CO2 is a metodows -- but in our discoveries , we found different metods .
This is a organism we have described in 1996 .
He lives in the ocean , about 2500 feet of deep-deep deeption of water .
They 're meter from CO2 , using hydrogen molecular hydrogen .
We 're trying to understand if we can indownership CO2 , which can be translated transported to be transported that CO2 in carburs , to drive this process .
So we can be able to be able to increase what we might be able to increase what the base is " life is Nooobic -- we have the modity of the inhery -- we have the modesty of oil .
Exactly . If you don 't do that from TED , where can you ?
It would be a main source .
And so we 're working to use the same metods to create vaccines .
You see this year with the influence , we 're always back to a year and a dollar in less when you 're going to find the right .
I think that what you can change building vaccinable in anticipately .
That 's how the future could start to look at , it 's going to be changing , the evolution of evolution , accelerating the evolution with bacteria , and you 're inspired , and inside the cell eket .
We 're so much as the best people .
Our purpose is to be able to be a long time to try to do it . Thank you very much .
Now , I 'm going to show you , the most rapidly possible , some fundamental work , a new technology that we have taken to Microsoft in the following one year ago . This is Seadragon . This is Seadragon .
It 's a environment that you can interact is in local level that you can interact with a huge amount of data .
Here we 're seeing a lot of photographing photos with a kind of zoom and continues , for a panoramics , and they 're going to a switing , disponing the images like .
And it doesn 't matter how big amount of information that we see , how big these are the data or images .
Most of the photographs , but this is a digital scanning from the Bioooooth-to-Congress , and reentered in the leg of 300 megapixeless .
It doesn 't make any difference because the only thing that the prestations of a system like this is the number of player on your screen on the screen in any time . It 's also a very flexible architecture .
This is a whole book , example of not data .
This is the Dickens of Dickens . Every colon-holder represented a chapter .
And to show you that is about telling you that it 's not imagery , we can do something like that , to make a real real representation of a representation , not a picture .
It could be a little artificial way to read a book to read a book .
I don 't have to be advice .
This is a more realistic . It 's a number of The Guardian .
Every picture is the beginning of a section .
And it 's going to you to have the pleasure of the version of a review of a review or a quotidian , which is for nature a lot of a lot .
We also did something with the corner of this particular number of the Guardian .
We 've created a fasules to be a higher resolutional ressolutional -- much more than that you use in a normal -- and we 've inserious .
If you want to see the characteristics of this automobile , you can see here .
Or other models , or even the specific model ,
And this really demonstrate some of these ideas to eliminate the limits of space on the screen .
We 're going to be able to put up to the pop-up and other downers and other downery , and they don 't have to be necessary .
Of course , the map is one of the most obvious applications for this kind of technology .
And on this one , I don 't want to lose time , if we don 't have to say that we have contributes to do this .
These are all the streets in the USA such survive picture of NASA .
So now we go to what else .
This now is actually , from the web ; you can go to the web ; you can see .
It 's a project called Photosynnnth , which combine two different technologies .
One is Seadragon and the other is a visual visual computer very interesting on the computer very interesting thing from Noh Snavah Seitz of Washington , with Steve Seitz Steve Steve Sezeliski Microsoft Rick Szeliskelian .
And it 's from Seb , the Web , and it 's a Seadragon .
You can see it when we do this kind of pattern , where we can go from a picture and have this kind of experience and have this kind of experience .
But the space of the picture of the images here has actually a meaning .
And the algorites of visualization have recorded these images together , so that they 're corresponding to the recorresponding to the recorded images -- all of the scaces , all of the way the images -- all of the way you see the holds of the Rococose -- they 're going to the elements . So , you see the elements of the flows of a living , and these things are all accounts .
I don 't know if I 've been showing you some other environment .
There are some more space space .
I want to go to one of the original data of Noahhhhahhhedent -- and this is from a prototype of Photosynnnnth that we have done to be the first time the scortextic scortiming to the first time , technology Photosynnnnthrown . And it 's not necessarily , looking at the environments we have in the world that we have put in the website .
We had to worry about the legal aspects and so forth .
This is a reconstruction of Notre catthedral Dame . Baast Flickr Baast , and you get imagery Notre Dame and you get imagery , and you get imagery , other campus and so on . Or one of these connect arcions , and so you know , and so it 's discovery .
So they 're all images from Flickr and they 're all colleaged to this way .
And it 's possible to navigate this way .
You know , I would never think about it about it for Microsoft .
It 's very gratifiction here .
I think you can see that it 's a lot of different types of different fields : from those photo-figure out of SLR , a number of the SLR , a number number , a meaning , they 're meaning , in this environment .
And if I can , I try to try to try to look at those strange .
Many of you are , and you 're going to do , etc .
And some part here is a series of photographs -- here 's a series .
This is a Notre Notre Dame recorrectly .
We can go from the poster to the vision of this environment .
The essential point is that we can do with social environment . This now is taking data from the whole memory , from the college of how to apping the land , from the perspective , from the point of visual visual view -- and college all of those data .
All those pictures become together , most of the som of the parts .
You have a model of the land that emerges .
Think of Stephen Lawler 's work on Earth virtual .
It 's something that growing in complexity as people who are using it , and the advantages for the ef huge .
Their photos are smart with methings from other people .
If someone is the idea of the idea of the teaching name , my photo the name , my picture of Notre Dame improved all of all of those data , and I can use how to do you all the data , and I can use the point of all of those data , and you can use the photographing , using the photographing photographing , and have a social experience of everyone , and red a cross-mod-like cross-mod-like , and red and red and red .
Of course , a consequence of all this is virtual model of any interesting , in the interesting , collected of any interesting , you don 't just from an airplane and imagery and satellite imagery and synthrown .
Thank you very much .
Chris Anderson : I realized ? What your software there to us to do is that a certain point in the next years , all the photographs , all the photographs , all the picture of anyone in the whole world will be going to be account with ?
BAA : Yes . What 's doing is basically discover .
It 's creating hyperlink , if you want , you to imagery , and you 're like imagery .
And it 's doing it in the base of the imagery .
The thing is very interesting if you think about the remember of security secity that many of these images of these images .
And as you do a research of images on the Web , you digits a frase and the text on the web page .
Now , what if that is the photo all of your picture ?
So the amount of interconnection and the amount of semantical and the amount of recognive that is really huge . It 's a classic effect of the network .
CA : Blaise , it 's really incredible .
BAA : You 're very much .
One of the main piaces when you traveling and one of the research of the research of the research of who has no long-forgoods , between who have no long-forgot the past , the wind in the wind , the wind , wind the wind of the rainy , wind , drives , drives , walk into the floor .
Basti think that scientists Jaguar traveling over the Via Lattea , or whatever the Inuit are still hanthrow , or Himalaya , the good demoves , and the idea that the world 's remember of Dharm , to remember the importance of the important anthropology of the anthropology , but it 's just a model of it , but it 's a model of reality ,
The consequence of a particular set of choices that our strops is done , good or mal , many generations ago .
And , of course , we all share of the essential tracts .
We all have . We all procrease .
We 're subjects to realization .
We have to deal the inesorability of death , so we don 't surprising and whalked us we 're saying and and we don 't surprising and
We all have a art .
What color is the physong , the rate of the song of every culture .
It doesn 't matter that they 're the " Borneo , or the following Voooodoo , or the wodoo of Haiti , or the werrote Kaisut in Kenya , or a wandered in Kenya , or a wandered in Sahara .
He was my journey of journey in the desert a month ago , or a yak of the values in the Everest , the Everest , the dea mother of the world .
All of these populations teachers are others of existing other ways of thinking , other ways of mudddle in the world .
And if you reflected a moment , it 's a concept that you can hope .
Insized , my concerned of cultures of the world creating a ragaggery of life and cultural and cultural that we fly want to the planet and it 's important to the planet as the ragela .
And you can think about this cultural ragela cultural ethnosfhere and you can call the som ethnosfhere , inspiring , ideas , inspiring , ideas , inspiration , ideas , inspiration , inspiring , inspiring , inspiring , inspiring , inspiray ,
The etnofhere is the patrimonium of humanity .
It 's the symbl of what we are and what we can be in how much species .
And because the biosphere was free consumed to be very quickly , and it 's happened to the etnosfhere and purpose .
Nothing , for example , it would say that 50 percent of all species was or is about the orary of the extinction of the extinction , or -- in the most apocalittical -- in the most apocaltical field -- and you don 't even even even close to the most optimistic .
The indeed of all this is , obviously , the loss of language .
When you 're born , they had 6,000 languages on this planet .
A language is not only by a vocabolary vocabolary or a series of rules .
A language is the sprazy of human spirit .
It 's the half a a half of which the animal of every culture is in material world .
Every language is a forest , a little bit , a little bit of a spiritual , a spiritual possibility .
And of those 6,000 languages , as we sitting here in Monterey , at least half is not more suddenly .
They 're not teached to children , which means , at less than not wills something , which is already dead .
What 's more about the sad than the sought of being the silence , the last to be the last to talk about a language , not to turn the swisdom of the pit of the pit of the pit ?
This orring was the one of some of the world every two weeks : every few weeks : every few weeks : every weeks , and it brings with the tombull the ulsyllabes of a very ancient language .
And I know somebody who are going to say , " Isn 't better that ?
The world would not be a better place if we 're going to lead to leave all the same language ? " Well , we talk about all yoruthized .
We talk koges .
You 're going to cover a tract tracks .
Today , I 'd like to do you a journey through the etnosfhere --
a little journey in the etnosfhere to give you a little bit of what we are lost .
Many of us forget that when I say , " diverse ways of existing existing very different ways of existing existing .
We take for example this Barasana , in Amazonia , Amazonia , the popull of the anaconia , which credeal to come from the west fidddle of the swest pacres of the swest rings .
It 's a popular popular that is not able to distinguy out of the green because the forest is , it 's identified in the forest , which depends the population .
They have a strange language and a matrimonial rules , " exameous language , " : You have to know a person who talk a different language .
All of this record in the past Mitological past , it 's that in these families in these families that are about about six or seven language of matrimons , and it 's because of matrimons , nobody basically a language .
They 're limited to listening and then they start talking .
We take one of the most interesting tribes with which I lived , the Waorani Eastern Ecuador , a popular populum that has had the first contact in 1958 .
In 1957 , five missionary missionary they have a facal contact .
They did the photographed the photographed photographed them in pose that they had an adichevoles , forestyed that this populse population had never seen anything about the size of the size .
They 've been collected the land , they 're going to be a shape or a figure and , not find nothing , they have concluded that they were tracked to diave the floor five missioned .
But Waorani didn 't just killed the straniors .
They killed with them .
The 54 percent of the mortality was caused by them .
We 're at eight of eight of the generations and we found two morte , and when we stroyed to know , they have a lot of them who was invited to be an old that one of them was ininvited to , and then they killed it , and then they killed it to the same .
The crawers were able to recognize the animal urine , and you know , and you know , and you know the species .
In the first 1980s , I was asked a very interesting task when my Harvard to me , if I wanted to go to Harvard to Haiti and I was going to the base of the Duvalier , and impossessor of Duvalier and the Tonton Macoutes , and impossessing the fast of the speaking of the speaking .
To give a sense of my racology , I would have to understand the Vodoun and Voodoo is not magnery .
It 's a fairly of complex metaphphysical view of the world .
Very interesting .
If I ask you to say the big religions of the world , what would you say ?
Cristianesimum , Islam , Buddism , Eburn , etc .
A continent is always left out , thinking that Africa is not about Africa has liken 't living religious . And instead , and Vooodoo is not the distilled to these religious concepts of these things very deepted in the tragic waiting of these things that are very deepy .
What makes the voodoor is the intense is the intense of life and death .
So the visual hyrhytheless .
The spirits can be invest of Great Acqua , they respect to the dance of the dance and they 're going to replace in the soul of vive vive , so that for a shoraneously active , so that for a short .
So , the voodoodoosts , " You know , " Hodows you 're going to talk about God .
We 're in the temple and diventive God . "
And from the moment that you 're going to drive , how can you do you get the walks , how can you do you have the walks ?
So you 're going to be amazing : followed the voodoor in state of trance that they 're touching unfuels in the body that you can be able to the body in the body , when it 's cataled in a state of the body when it 's cataled in a state of extreme extreme .
And the populers with the most extraordinary populers are the Kogi Sierra Nevada in Sierra Nevada , in Colombia , in Colombia .
It 's the ancivilization that one has been living on the planning of Colombia in the wild-account plug , the population population , the population was on the maintain the maintain the maintain the major switch .
In a macchiated , a blood , this popular , this popular was never conquire to the Spanish .
And so , in fact , they 're governed by a clery , but they 're very extraordinary .
The young people come up with the family , and they live secreated in a world , and they live secreated in a world , and they live in a good world and homes in the glacier of the glacier for 18 years .
Two of the nine years of proposed to reach the nine months of gestation that turn into the user of the mother , now they 're metaphorically in the Great Mother .
So , this time , they 're accultured to their society , values that they predict and just their prevent , and just their preghiers to make the cost of the equilibrium -- or to say the equilibrium .
And in the earthquake of this incredible beginning , and they 're suddenly taken out and for the first time in 18 years , they see a alba . And in that accounter-hand , in that 's the first wrong values of the first crowded values of the beautiful valued , everything that they have learned in the splay . The prevent , and it 's a further , and he says :
" Wide ? I said , " I said .
It 's stupend . I 'm going to protect . "
It 's called the most brothers and they say that we , fratels , we 're the collies of the destruction of the world .
This is extremely important .
When we think about the ingene and the environment and we 're invote Resize and the old story of the self-wild story , which is a concept in his simplicity or maybe we 're going to the Thoreau and we say that these populations are closer to the Earth .
The indigenes are not sentimental feeling is indebolites from nostalogy .
There 's no space for these things in the palures of the Aststststat the gelids of Tibet , but thank you , they created a mystics of the Earth 's based on the concept of the Earth 's not on the concept of being known to the concept of the Earth is that it 's only because it 's infection of the Earth is because it 's infection of human consciousness .
What does it mean ?
It 's a guide of Ande who growing Ande , which is a mountain Apu that mountain Apu that drils his destine will be a human to be a destine , and it will have a different report and it will have a different report of Montana , and it 's a bagreed that a mountain of Montana , which is going to be scraten .
That 's the dimtained one or a mineral mineral is irright-iny ced .
What 's interesting is the metaphor that defines the way the real individual and the natural world .
I grew up in the forests of Columbia Britannicnicity created that the forests will be cut .
And that 's made me a human being in my Kwakiutl that they create that the forests are the Hukukuk and the bald of Hukuk and the bald stort and the spiriters that live in the world , spiriters that live in the world , spirites that they 're going to be in the beginning .
If you start to look at that these cultures can create different reality , you can start to understand some their sensational discoveries . We make this plants .
I 've been taken this picture in the nordoccipes in the Norororordoctor .
Mayahuasks about the ayahuasca , the most powerful sustained , the most powerful such .
What makes a fascinating the ayahuashuasca is not the potential to the submacological . It 's composed to two elements .
Da a late , this lian lab that contains a series of cookacarboline , harmine , probably hallucinogenes .
It 's just just the only plant is a fire fire smoke that altery a little cost , but it 's measured with the leaf of a coffee family said Psychotra .
This is a sad sad powerful sad , very similar to the serotonin the smothththoxypamine-five , methoxypamines .
If you 're going to see Yanomami , you 'll see the naso sustainant that they do from a different set of species , anchypamyltrypamine .
Tiring that polly-herg is a little bit like to be spared by a fire smoke , and we can be a bunch of woes and we can be a depink .
I had often with my professor , Richard Evan Shultes , the man who wait was psychedelic , with his discovery of the fungi in the 1930 in Mexico .
I 'm not a tiny tent , you can 't classify these tripes like , because if you 're not going to tell any any of you can 't tell any one of being hallucinated . Second . " The triployed to be not very horly because they 're money from a summmed , because they 're money from a mounoth-s-souldn 't be .

Now , this is the beautiful : Sacarboline that are in this liana is injumped in this liana , the same kind of the potential , in a sadployes : in a free free free free free . The question is , like these popull , like these populations , but if you combined a lot of them , but if you combined a summmmmage of the som of the time ?
We use the great eusty of prove and error , and it can reveal .
But if we ask the Indian , they 'll tell us , " The plants are talking . "
What does it mean ?
This tribes , the Cofan , the cofan , has 17 variety , which distinguy , and that we have nectely realized in the forest , and that our eyes will be in the same species .
If we 're asking them like , they 'll be able to be " I thought , " I thought , " I thought plants , I didn 't know that ? " I don 't know all ? "
The solution is : you take 17 variety in a night of a mountain and each other with a tone .
And that 's not a Harvard , but it 's much more interesting than to stay .
Now , [ [ [ ] ] ] the problem is that the ones of us who have heart populs out there are pitting them in a way , but in some way you can get you pect to the real world , and it 's pass .
In fact , the 20th century , between 300 years , it will not remember for his drives or innovations , but rather as the technology was where we are stop stop and we have been hunt and we have been hunt , and we have been hungering , and we have a lot of the biological destruction of the planet . Now , the problem is not the change .
All the cultures through the secos have been involved in a dance for new possibility .
And the problem is not technology .
The Indian Sioux didn 't stop to be Sioux when they 're part and fit and free , and they 're like Americans don 't stop being American have been in the horse and hot .
It 's not the change or technology that threatening the integrity of the ethnosfhere .
The flight flight .
And if you 're a look at the world , you 'll see that these are not culture .
They 're creatures and dynamics , and dynamics out of identify identify that they 're going to their ability to adaptation .
My discovering in the patria patria of the Since .
a populum names of Sarawak , in sudwest , a popull that has lived in the foresta generation , and we reduced to the services , and we reduced to the services of the recorded , where you can see the flowing of the recorded by the light-flowing in Mererernal Cinese Mernaves , where the horizing horizing in the Meries , where the horizon-swest ,
You 're going to get the standing with the woood such the forest .
Or , in the case of Yanomami , are the disease that are come with the discovery .
If we 're on the mountains of Tibet , where I 'm doing a lot of research , you 'll see the flight of politics .
How do you know the genocide , the physical extinction of a popular , is condannestyle , but the ethnocide , destruction of a popular popular lifetime , not just condent cebrated , because it 's part of the development , because it 's part of the development .
And you can 't understand the Tibet of the Tibet .
I lost the 6,000 miles from China in China , in China , and I went to the Tibet , coming to Lhasa with a young holding , but only came to Lhasa , but only came to Lhasa , I realized what we feel behind .
6,000 monuments sacres reduced in pollyer and cenhery .
1.2 million people killed from the Cultural military living .
The father of this guy was ascritical to Panchen Lama .
The one that means that was killed to the Chinese invasion .

All the end , all of it is to a choice .
We want to live in the world world 's monocromatical world or we want to coake the world poloownership ?
The great anthropologa Margaret Mead , before he die said that , in our biggest vision was that , in our way , not just see the whole gamm of human imagination , not just see the whole gamm of human imagination , but one day we 're going to a modality of the way there were others .
And it 's umillion years old , we remember that our species is existed for 60,000 years .
The Neolitics Rivolution , who has given us agriculture , which has done us to have a seed clumn cult , and they 're sitting the poem of the chlering clerarchies , creating the gerarchy of the specialization , and we talk about 10,000 years ago .
The modern world industrialized has been 300 years .
That 's a story not suggests that we have the answers to all the challenge that we should be to deal in the millenny .
When these myriades of the world is asked what you want to say to be human , respect with 10,000 different voes .
And it 's in these risky answers that we 're all risky the possibility of being what we are : a conscious , which has to make all the people and all the people all the gardes and all the gardes . And there are great moments of optimism .
I 've been taken this picture on the northern extremely Baffin , when I went to cut up with the Inuit , and this man , Olaya , and this man , Olaya , he told , he 's told me the wonderful story of his grandfather .
The government is not always gentile with the Inuit and the 1950s to stand in the 1950s to stand in the 1950s , we have running them in colonies .
The grandfather of this man refected to go .
The family , teaching for his life , and he took them up all the arms , and all his record .
You have to know that Inuit don 't teach the cold ,
The sliterally sliterally were made of weight in the paper of paper .
The grandfather is not intimise of this man , or the first night or from the libraries .
It 's gaulated , and it 's calculated pantalone and defected in the focused in their hand . When you do it , you have been congeled , they 've been congeled , they 've been working a lama .
It 's spred on the points of this coltelephysical colder and when I solide , he killed a dog .
It 's been wait and created a blue , with the hundred , and he created a sliterally , he 's a bunch of a sliterally , and it 's squeen on the bucky , college ,
We want to talk about cavarye with anything ? [ Risyou . And this , in different ways , [ Applausi is the symbl symbl the bol of the Inuit and all the populations of all the world .
In the 1999 , the Nelt government canaded to the Inuit to the total control of a largest California and Texas a gest California and Texas .
It 's their new patria . It 's called Nunavut .
It 's a independent . They know , they 're all the mineraries .
One splends of how a nation-state can recognize with his popull .
And , in finally , I think it 's rather obvious than we have been in these remote zone of us was in these remote zone .
For somebody is .
They represent sections of human imagination . And for us all the time . And for us all , the dreams of these kids , like dreams of our children , become part of our children , become part of the swisdoes of hope .
For finally , we have National Geographic , we convints that politicians will never get nothing .
We believe that polemies --
[ Applauses are not persuasive , but we believe that the stories can change the world , and maybe we are the best institution to tell the world , and maybe we are the institution of the world . Ogggen our site .

Our revision are literally laughter millions of people .
Our work is travel in the etnosfera to bring our audience in a world of amazing cultural beyond what they 're going to be wrong and they 're hoping , and you hope , they 're going to be able to reveal anthropology : the world 's existing in a world , and we have to find one of life in a world and multural .
where the wisdom of all the populations can contributing our college .
Thank you .
I 'm going to talk about some things I wrote in this book that I hope you have heard and I 'm going to evidence some college college , in case not them .
I 'd like to start with what I call " the dogma .
The official dogen of what ?
The official dogen of all the industrial society . The dogma dogma : " If we want to massive to well-being our citizens . " The way to do is massive liberty . "
The reason is , from a moon , in fact that liberty is in the fact that freedom is the value , it 's precious , useful , essential for humans .
And the other is in the fact that if we are libes , each of us can act for all the way to do everything that maximies our well-being , without one that decide in our name .
The way to massive freedom is massive freedom .
More choice , and more choices , and more is liberation , and more is their liberty , more is their liberation .
This is so deeply record , it 's so deeply radiced in society that nobody 's going to be a doubt .
And it 's also deeply radicated in our lives .
I 'm going to show you some examples of what progress has made possible .
This is my supermarket . It 's not particularly great .
I 'm a simple simple note for indicatments .
In my supermarket , there are 175 conditions , without content 10 variety of olive and 12 acethes and 12 acethes that you can buy to you a huge numbers of condent in the circumstance in the circumstance that nobody of 175 , and they 're degree .
That 's what 's the supermarket .
Then you go to the injumped to buy a stereo stereo : CD , radio , radio , radio , radio , radio , radio , radio ,
And in this single negoties of electronic electronic components .
We can make six million and a half of different different different and a half of different different and a lot of different .
You need to admit that there is a lot of choice .
Altrack camps : the world of the communications .
Once , when I was a child , they could get all the desire the wish phone , and they were sitting from mamm , and they were sitting from mom .
It was a phone , you didn 't buy it .
A consequence of that , between the other , was that the telephone was never .
These days are gone .
We have a variety of phones , especially , especially between the phones .
Here 's the phones of the future .
My favorite is the middle , MP3 , tops of the naso , and foreign in the side to the crowd .
If you don 't have seen it in the negotie under home , you 're burning .
And what 's happening is that people enter in the negozes in the gozes and does this question . And you know what is the answer is " No . "
It 's not possible to buy a phone that doesn 't do it too much .
So , in other aspects of life that are much more important than the budyes , you know , it 's the same explosion of choice .
Axitary , it doesn 't happen in the United States that you 're wouth to be the doctor and doctor , you know what you have to do .
Instead , you wait , and the doctor says , " OK , we can do A , or you can do it , or you know , " Actually , " Boy has these " Boy and these risks " " Do you have these risks and these risks . What do you want to do ? "
You 're dying , " Dr. What would I do ? "
And the doctor says , " A has these benefits , and these risks , and B has these benefits . "
" What do you want to do ? "
And you rebats : " Dror if she was me , what would you do ? "
And the doctor : " But I 'm not her . "
The result of the result of the disease , " expression that makes it seemed a beautiful thing .
But it 's not that a moment is that a fish and the responsibility of some things , you know , it 's doctor , someone else , at someone who don 't know -- and almost certainly is -- and so it 's not in the ideal condition to make the patient .
There 's a huge marketing products , direct people like me and you , and you know , you know , if you think it doesn 't have a sense , because we can 't buy them .
But if we can 't buy them , why do you have them ?
The answer is that they want to doctor to ask them to be doctor for us to change the recipe .
What is the fundamental as is our identity is a question of choice , as you see in this vignished , like you see in this vignished , " We don 't want to be a ydrogen right now . " We don 't have a more identity : we have to invent .
And we can reinventing how many times we can .
The that means that every morning , at the risveilling , you have to decide that kind of person wants to be .
I 'm going to spect the family and matrimonium , a time time , it was that you know , it was that you were going to be the most possible , and he was that you were going to get the most price as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as well as well as well as well as well as
The only verse was with who , and it was not when , and it was not when it , and it 's not what to do after .
Or day , all is really to play .
I 'm very smart students , and I think about 20 percent in less than a time .
And it 's not less , because they 're not because they 're not because they 're fligent .
but why are they impensierites , I 'm going to ask , " Would I do this right now ? "
" Would I have to hear me ? "
I 'm interrogatives .
And they 're trying to answer these questions , even if this implessons that you 're not completely to do a good vote to my own own own own exame .
And they 're really important . They 're very important questions .
Now , the job : We 're lucky , as Carl such , because technology lost us to work every minute , every day , every one one one day , from every angle of the planet , transpl Randpurning .
And in the parently , there 's a cornership , and I won 't say that , where WiFi works .
I don 't say , because I want to use it .
What is this incredible freedom of choice we have about choice that we have to work ? It 's going to be , if we have to work or not .
We can go to see our child toy , with the cell phone , the Blackberry , the Blackberry in the other , and the ntask , and the nake , the ginnery .
And even though they 're all spent , every minute we see our child , we 're also asking the game , we 're also asking this called ? "
" I have to answer this email ? I have to habboze this letter ? "
And also when the answer is " no , " this makes the experience of your child very different child , very different from what it would be in other conditions .
So , from any part of the look , and big things , and big materials , and the materials and living , life is a question of choice .
Once the world was this : Ovept , there were some possibility , but it wasn 't all a question of choice .
The world today is a lot of this : The dilemma is , " Is it a positive thing , or negative ? "
The answer is Seep .
The positive slide of them , so I 'm going to talk about those negative ones .
All this choice two effects of two effects on people .
The first , paradoxial , is that produces instead of paralysis that fliberation .
With a lot of the options of which choose choose choose , it becomes very difficult to do this .
I 'm a meaningful example : a conducted sound plans of floor further .
A colleages has had access to the data of Vanlook at the data , the giant society of founding , with about a million clients in 2000 different clients .
What she has discovered is that for every 10 solutions that are offered in more , the lost of adesion the floor percent .
With 50 source of offered , there 's less than when they 're dispone-further than five percent ?
Because with 50 source of the free , which is maledced to decide , and choice is to decide , and choice is to the tomorrow .
And at the questions , and I still ask questions , and questions , and of course , and of course , and I 'm not going to be .
You know , it doesn 't just mean these work on the old hands for canoes , because they don 't have enough money , you want to say that the decision is so ostics that the decision is so ostics that they lose the bottom of work .
Not in the packing , they 're lost to five dollars to year from dator or dateed , which would be so so much .
So the paralysis a consequence of having a path .
And I think that makes the world like this .
" And finally , " And the thernity : ketchup , or maionese ? "
You 're going to take the decision , if it 's for the ethernity , right ?
You don 't want to choose the source cut , and nepurpose the wrong condition .
So this is the first effect . The second is that we can have been able to evitate the paralysis , and we 're less under the result of how we would be with less options to be less options to what we would choose .
And this for different reasons .
One of these is that with a lot of condments that you would have a lot better , and it 's not perfect , it 's not perfect , it 's easy to imagine that you would have been better . And what happens is that the alternative , and the reciple is that the alternative imagined us indues , and the reduced the floor , the recipaced by decision ,
And when it was a very good decision .
More : The choice is , more easy is , easily dispilexes that it 's insection of the option .
And there is what economists call .
Dan Gilbert has asked very well as the value we see things about what we see with things about what we 're in the way .
In the rest , when there are many options , it 's easy to represent the characteristic , and you 're not sitting and be less under the option that you have to be less to choice .
Here 's an example . I love with all of them who are not New York .
But it 's what you probably think .
There 's this copy to Hamptons .
A place of luses .
It 's splendida . Ottim . It 's all about them .
Not nothing . But what he think about is , " Well , a building , it 's Agofter . "
" All my neighbors in Manhattan is . "
" I could talk about front of the home . "
And I 'm going to go two weeks , which is lost -- every day -- the chance to talk about what it is lost .
The deminud-opportunity is the soul for what we have , even when the choice was an excellent .
And the more options we have to be the more than we have to be , more than the characteristics .
Here 's another example .
This vignize a lot of things .
We talk about the moment , and perhaps of living living .
But the most important point is that whatever you choose to do not do other .
The things that we don 't choose are tactive that can make less attractive what we do .
Terzo : it 's a growing of the expectation .
I tried to my skin my skin beating a new jeans .
I 'm almost always jeans .
And once the jeans were just a kind of a kind of comprecord and vestivestive , they were just after having them a life and worked , and they were going to a lot of times , they started to go well .
So , I went to buy a couple again when the old old old old one one couple of jeans , and I said , " I 'm a couple of jeans , this is my cut . "
The fit said , " Li wants to slim , easy , he relaxed up ? "
He wants with the buttons or with the bottons ? "
" World ? "
" Sott them want to be a bl , " Bl the bl -- " Continuated to eleneneneneneneneneneneneneneneneneneneneneneneneneneneneneneneny .
I was switing , and after a little bit , I was able to say , " I want the kind of the only kind of -- that was the only kind of what was , so for a hour jeans , so I tried all of the jeans , then use from the negotie , and then the best jeans , with the best couple of jeans , with the best jeans that I ever had .
It was the massive . And all of that choice , I had got the better .
But I felt .
Why ? I wrote a book to understand this .
The reason I was going to be a worse is that with all the choice was very high , jeans had to be perfect .
I didn 't expect . I didn 't expect me . I didn 't expect anything that was just a kind of a kind , but when it was a kind of 100 different , wait , at least a kind of had to be perfect .
What I had to buy was good , but not perfect .
After I was walked with what I was trying to do with what I was introduce in the expectations .
The addition of the options of the people don 't do that increase expectations that these have respect to the options that these have respect to the options that these have respect to the options that these have respect to the options that these have respect to the excellence of the options that these have respect to the op
And this will produce less subsiddress , even when the results are good .
Nobody in the world of marketing in the world marketing .
Because if you know , you don 't know what I 'm talking about .
The truth of this .
" The reason she was better when he was the worst " The reason it was better when he was the worst was that when you were going to the worse was possible .
Or the world we live in the world that we live -- opulent , industrialized citizens with the expectation of perliving -- we can hope is that things are in the height .
You never have surprised because your expectations , my waites , you 're ingiant .
The secret of happiness -- what you 're here -- is , " Basse , " Yes , " Yes , " Yes , you want to you . "
I mean -- little authobiography -- which is really sposed and my wife is really stupend .
I won 't have to do better , I don 't have to do it .
But you don 't always always , it 's a bad thing .
And finally , a consequence of jescomoment when there is only that jeans is just that when you 're not sitting , and you 'll ask , and you " Why ? "
" Who is responsible ? " " The answer is .
The world is the responsible . What can I do ?
When there are hundreds of jeans , and you buy a windate , and you ask you who is the responsible , is the responsible , it 's the responsible to the responsible you .
You 're going to do better .
With hundreds of variety , there are no wild .
So when people are taking decisions , even if the result is , they 're sitting and they 're sitting and damage and they 're the collied and they 're going to their same .
Neise years , the depression is explose in the industrialized world .
I think a factor of a factor -- not the only one , but important -- this waveling depression is that people have experiences of the people have experiences of the high because standard is too high .
And when they 're going to explain this situation think that the colpattern is their colpattern .
So the end end end of the final is that we 're better , objectively , but we feel worse .
Let me remember .
This is the official official , what we all take for good and it is completely false .
There 's no doubt that a little bit of choice is better than you have to have no deal , but it doesn 't have a little bit better than it .
There 's a critical value , magic value . I don 't know what it is .
But I 'm sure we have supered by a piece of the level where the choice would improve our life .
Now , from the political point -- I 'm very very finite -- I 'm very very finite , the political nocity is the following .
What is the material that you lots of this particular choice in industrial society is the rich material .
There are a lot of places in the world , and you 're about , where the problem is not that they have a choice .
The problem is that they 're too poorse .
So the face of the face I 'm talking about is a disease of modern , remember of modern , remember that society .
And what does to have to do and array is this : Steve Levitt talked about how those constoes and discovered and discomoyesterday . It 's a spring of money .
I mean , these choices , complicated and dispendispency , it 's not that they 're just inuseful .
I 'm telling of the eteries .
They do it to stay .
If a little bit of what in our society allows that they 're going to be reversed in those where people have too much as well , it would be not only their lives , but also our life .
This is what economists call a better paretian paretian .
A redistribution of the redent is good at all -- not just to be poor -- because of this choice in excepted that we go back .
Father , " Let , you can get everything that you want , " --
You know , people of culture , think , " What does that fish ? "
" It 's obvious that you can 't get to a bocket . "
" United imagination , a limited vision of the world -- "
And I 'm interpreted it so , at the beginning .
But then , think about it , instead , I realized that fish the long-.
Because the reality of the fact is , if you eat the bocks , so , " you know , " you don 't get the freedom . You 're optil the paralysis .
If you 're going to be the bocks , you 're going to be deminulies .
You 're going to get the paralysis , and you 'll reduced the well-being .
All they need a sphere .
This is almost certainly too much , maybe even for the fish , and sure for us .
But the assummmull of a symbolic symbolic symbolic sfetime .
Thank you very much .
