The year I showed these degrees to show that the calculate glacial artics , which for almost three million years , which for almost three million years of the United States , you have been retended to 40 percent .
I 'm going to show the gravity of the problem because it doesn 't show it spesses of the ice .
The calculate is , in a sense , in a sense , in a sense , a sense , the heart of the global climate system .
You can see it 's invern and you get the extate .
The next diapositive is going to be a rapiece of cars from the last 25 years .
The aces are draw in red red red .
You see , you see , you see , you see , you see ,
That is the ice in the ice , which is the extate , which you know , you know ,
You can see that the cosidate cover , of five years or more , or more , is like the sangue , which here is the body here is the body here .
In 25 years , it 's going to be , so that .
This is a problem because the remarkable to the third of the three-year-old around the ocean artical scale , where there are enormous quantities of coal congeled that , sciently , they come to put metry , and they 're transformed in metry .
I 'm going to go to the toy of the atmosfertic atmosfertic , that quantities could be drawings , that quantities could not go , and I wouldn 't go around .
In some laghi , I 'm profound in Alaska metry is already to the water .
The professoresse Walter Walter of the University of Alaska team is recently reached with a team of a told swood .
Video : Wow ! Al Gore : The question is , it 's good . And what 's if we 're going to be .
A reason is that this extremely rescale of the Groenland from the northern northern .
This is a return to reme to remember .
The brought them had never reached them .
This is the Kangerluslier Kangerluslier , in the west of Groenland .
If you want to know how to go to the mate of the mate of the ice of the ice of the ice , here is where we reach it , here is where you reach it .
These are rents are caught .
Another part of the planet : Antartide , the largest block of the planet .
The month is wills have been deed that the bilan--year-old , and that the Antartitttttarttartifly , which is in some of the isoles , which is particularly , it 's particularly , it 's particularly in the scientists .
It 's a six meters of the action of the action , like Greenland .
You know , Himalaya , the third of gake , you see new laghi , you see new laghi , who were a few years ago .
The 40 percent of the world was going to remember water , it 's going to the population .
Sulle Ande : this ice is the bottom of the water of the powerful powerful water .
The brought is caught .
But when you go to the water , the same happens to the water .
In California , the news on the Nevad is diminugly 40 percent .
The gets are in crisis .
You know , like you read , you know , I 'm graves .
The growth is going to have a night of the car in the door of the car .
The environmental environmental returing out of the normal and without precedent .
So , so much more numbers in the last 30 years , you know , 75 .
This is a beautiful beyond .
If you look at the context if you can see the context .
We add the last five to add million tons of CO2 , 24 hours in the ocean in the ocean in the ocean in the ocean every day .
You look at the Pacific area of the Pacific area , from the American area , and in the west , and you 're going to the subcontinent , where there is a readradical impoverty , where there 's a radical impoverty .
Most of global warming , together to the global deforestation , which is the 20 percent , is the equal of commercial warming .
The oil is a problem , and the carbon is even worse .
The United States are one of the most emissions with China .
And you provide to build a lot of other coal .
But we 're going to have a change of direction .
These are the annative projects in the last few years and some property of alternative .
And every way , there is a lot of politics in our country .
The carbon and oil and oil have spent 250 million dollars in the last year year for the last year to promote carbon , which is a carbon , which is a obous .
So , I remember the image I was going to something --
I 'm going to go to the Natal Tennessee , where I live , there was a 3.8 billion liters of carbon .
You 've seen it on the news .
This is the most big floor of scories in America .
It 's happened around Natal .
The publishing of one of the carbon of carbon industry was this .
Video : The coal , " East is a couple and happy .
It 's abondant here in America , and it makes our economy .
Frosty the carbon is always more .
It 's going to be a good , adorable and the work of the hands of the hands of it .
Al Gore : Da is free of the coal West Virginia .
The largest society is Massey Coal .
Video : Don Blankenship : I 'm going to me -- Al Gore , Nancy Peloi , Harry Reid -- not not what they 're talking about .
Al Gore : So , the Alleance for the Clima of Clima has launch two washes .
This is one of it , one part .
Video : ALergy : COOLergy see the climate change as a serious business .
So , our priority is investing to investing a big amount of money in a suggake to a public rest and conflict the truth of carbon .
In fact , the carbon is not sport .
We think it 's not not , it 's a good on profuse .
So , not precious pateves of climate change .
Let me do us .
Video : Actor : You 've heard of it -- you 've heard to talk to very much .
So I do that I do a gake in a structure to the west as a carbon .
Straordinary ! The machines are a little bit of the carbon , but this is the such of carbon technology .
The carbon is between the main is between the main rescale , but the night , the night of carbon , but the night of carbon that you see it .
You have to have a wod-technology of coal ,
Al Gore : I finally , the alternative is the positive is the network and that is to the national question .
Video : The America is in America is in the crisis ; the economy , the national crisis , the crisis .
The falls all of our adpendence , our dependence from the cooil , like the carbon and oil and oil .
Now , I 'm going to go , there is a new , to solution for using it .
Repower : 100 percent of energy , in the 10s .
A piece to put the America to work , to make sure that , and to help us , and help to stop the global warming .
And , of course , a solution that basts to solve our problems .
It 's America . Scoprite of more .
Al Gore : This is the last .
Video : It 's going to reach : It 's to America .
One of the most fast to be able to be able to the end of the cobustic modness that killed our planet .
What is that : The future is here . I 'm here , only new energy , a new energy .
What 's two : Nuobs investment for pounds of work for bought to work .
Comage : Repower . It 's time to be realistic .
Al Gore : A old old , I 'm going to go back , " If you want to go back , you go to the sun , you go to the sun .
If you want to go back , you go to go back , you know , you know ,
We need to go away , fast , fast .
Thank you very much .
The year is going to TED feck at TED .
And I promise to get to beach to the nars on how it works .
So , I have been . And for those that other time , there were no , the LHC is the largest experiment , I 've ever been a lot of a conference .
However is to remember the conditions that were less than a billion on the beginning of the universe -- to 600 million times in the universe -- to 600 million times .
And it 's just just environment .
This is the car is the Ginevra .
We 're a remarkable of these mini-Bang Bang Bang Bang inside .
This is what I work . It 's called ATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLAS .
This is an image of ATLATLAS in in building so you can see the proportions .
The 10 settember is going to be going to be access , we have access to the first time .
And this picture was writing by ATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLAS .
It 's because it 's immense to be festeggs in the saving .
It 's an image of the first phasm of the first physitting in the LHC , both , both in collision , with one part of the LHC , and I spread in the raising .
In other words , when we see that image the image 10 settember , we understand that machine , which is a big vitting .
I don 't know if it was this to do that , when somebody went to Google and I went on Google and vide that was the beginning was this .
That means that we had a cultural impact of the scientific impact .
I think it was a week after , there was a problem with the machine , I had to have to these dorated here -- these dored drugs .
These challs are 13,000 print when the machine is going to the massive machine .
Now , the technical between you 're going to look at the kids and they 're going to say , " it 's not true .
And instead of it because when they 're very cold , they can become cosidings .
So , at least 271 , at least at a temperature in the space between space , these kids , these files can bring that corrent .
In one of the most of the most of the most namile of the most of the nake in the LHC , there was a faburation .
So , the falls realized , and 13,000 prined to realized , and 13,000 practices .
This was the result .
Now , this is even more impressive if you think that these magnetic fish are more than 20 tons , and that you have been spoke about 30 centimeters .
They 're dants about 50 magnetic .
We had to take them , what we did .
We repristined and flowing .
And they 're going to go to the ground of them in the ground .
I finally , the end of the LHC will be new integry .
We 're going to get , and we 're going to get the right right right now , and we continue to go to judge , and we continue to discovered what are the universe .
Now , of course , in a certain way , these craft , these indebate dibad , and the engineering of the compared and the engineering . It 's easy to condition .
I think the fact that 's so hard , the fact of the limits , I think is this value of the value of things like LHC .
I 'd like to conclude with a scientist Inglese , Humphrey Davy , which , I 'm in the indefesthree-indefeshologist , and his published , his published , and he said , " Nichel Faradid , " " Nichael Faraday , " " " Nichael Farady , which is not about how to be able to be new monstricks , and that they 're not going to be new monkey to be .
Thank you .
I want to start to ask you to start to think when children , kids , from the morning , play , you play with the morning .
And you know , you know , how to reach them , and you get them and moving them , and then you 're going to think , and you know , and you know , to think of problems and remainly resolve .
The reason is to project is proaching to the way we understand part of the world around us .
So , from information , by the pylity of our interaction with objects , together at my physicians , and my collaborator , and my collaborator , I started asked me , I started asked up , I started asked me , " And when we 're a computer , instead of the mouse , as we can have only get the current of the digital , and I could have a physical information with the way ,
and sistemulate to our piaciment ?
The question was so interesting that I decided to exploring the answer , I build the answer , I build the Siftable .
In a few words , a Siftable computer is a computer interactive computer as a couple .
In a few words , a Siftable computer is a computer interactive computer as a couple .
You can see it with hand , you can see , " you see , " you see the same movement and have a radio radio radio and a radio radio .
But it 's also , I 'm objects , like physics , you can move to simply fashion .
The Siften is the example of a new ecosystem to ecomic tools to manipular information .
And as as hand , they 're more physical , of the other people , and the people , and as as as it physical , and they 're more to be more than ovisual , as we can exploring new and different different kinds of interaction .
I 'm going to do with some simple example .
This Sift-surn is configurned to show that , if you inclin a direction , if you 're going to go back , if you 're going to the other side .
These are interactive interactive are conscious conscious .
If you 're going to be interesting to what is about about what they 're going to go around .
If you 're circummmle , they 're going to act and they can act a little bit .
If you 're circummmle , they 're going to act and they can act a little bit .
They have truth their movement and inclination .
We have rest that one of the interaction was the most implications of interaction was the power of the interaction , to example , " " " to talk to a color , " " " " to talk to a color , "
In this case , we have three Siftable conflict as secks like secks of the color in the color in the central , where you 're missing .
I can use it to go to the color in the central color in the central , where they 're missing .
If we 're too , we can put a little bit of a little place .
I also have the very good possibility of appears , like languages , and the mathematics and loges of logical where people can try and see the fast , and you see the results , and you see the results of the immediately .
I 'm going to --
This is a sequence of Fibonackage that I do with a program of equations .
Here we have a player of words that is half of Scarabeo and Boggle .
Pratically , at every turn out of every turn out of every Siftable , Pratically , at every turn , at every turn out of every table , and while you 're trying to compories that 's a dionce of it .
Then , after 30 seconds of them , and you have a new new lectelling and new possibility to try and new possibility to try to try and new possibility .
Thank you .
Here 's what the children came to the Media Lab , I 've done in the way that I 'd been doing and I took a video .
They 're very fashion .
And one of the interesting things to have to be application is that you don 't have to give people many inside of many indeed .
And only say , " What 's about words , " What 's going to do .
Here 's how other people who are trying to be .
This is our head header , right there is the right right there .
It was just to be just implate them .
They 're only morning , for him .
Now , this is an application of a charge application .
We wanted to build one tools for the appears of the languages .
It 's going to give new characters in the winking , solving the Siften , they 're going to be .
It 's going to give new characters in the winking , solving the Siften , they 're going to be .
And it 's doing it .
Video : The sole is source .
David Merries : Now he took a bad in the wird-scene .
Video : The tractor .
Bel ! Yeah !
So , I 'm going to go to the Siftable and you can interact with the characters ,
Video : Bau !
I inventing the story .
Video : Ciao !
DM : It 's a story with final , and it can decide that he wanted to go .
DM : It 's a story with final , and it can decide that he wanted to go .
Video : I 'm going to go on ,
DM : The last example I 've got the time to show you is a tools , to recently realized , to wild and exept music .
It 's one instrument , I 've got to recently , and exef music .
The Siften here , they 're going to suons like base , and the battery .
Each one of these has four different variations , and you can choose to choose .
You can also be insert these suons in a sequence to your piaciment to your piaciment .
And it 's just to do a simply to be a super and a sequence . "
These are actually that you can find out of the vive , like the reverbs and the filter and the filter .
You know , you know , you know , you know , incls to push it .
And then there are the general of the general as time and fly , which you know , you know ,
We look at how it works .
Video : We 're going to put a base in two Siftable , " " sequence , " We 're going to go in a series , we add the other base .
Now , I 'm going to put a low line .
Video : DM : Now , I add of the percussions --
Video : And I 'm going to put the filter , so I can control the battery , so I can control the battery , so I can control .
Video : I can fast to be quening the intersequence to inclinking the time from a landlate or from one of the time or from another .
Video : And I 'm going to add the fills to the floor to give more expression .
Video : I can 't recombine the sequence of the flight-fly . "
So I don 't have to be plan , but I can improvate , I can improvate , or more more than it .
And now , finally , I can make the interest the interest to go to the right right right now , " I want to go to the Siftable . "
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is to build new must be able to car and more soon to the brain and more soon to work .
And today , I had a time to show you one of the result of this perspent , and some possibilities that we 're going to take out from the lab .
The concept that I want to transmate is that we 're going to get this new generation of objects for digital objects , which will bring information in our world in the way that we want .
Thank you very much .
I don 't see the time to talk with all of you .
They 're a writing .
I 'm going to writing is my profession , but it 's more than this , of course .
It 's also the love and the fascinating of my life .
And I don 't expect to change .
But , I said , something particular is happened in my life and my charge , and my charges , which I took me to remember the interact with this .
The particular thing I 'm going to wrote this book , this biography called " Manogy , " Am , Prrra , " I 'm , I 'm going to go out in the books , for some reason , for some reason , and it 's a big , and it 's a big , became , became a big , became a big , and it 's a big , became called " Manegy , I 'm going to get the interest .
And the result is that everywhere to go , people who are going to me to be as if you were condition .
Davion -- I 'm saying , I 'm going to go .
They 're going to go to me and say , I 'm saying , " I don 't know , you know , you don 't have to do better ?
You don 't have to keep to writing for all life without power to be able to create a book that can 't be able to create a book that ? "
What can you do ? "
It 's rashes , you know .
But it could go , at the way to me that I 'd been going to say , when I started to say , I was an adolescent -- I was a writing -- I wanted to to be a writing .
I met the same reaction of the same car .
And people said , " I didn 't teach me to be able to be able to have success ?
You don 't have to be hubility of the refight ?
You don 't have to do this for the window for all life without the life that nothing to come and die on a heart cumoon a sogames with the bottom of the bouth of the bouth of the bouth ?
So , you know .
The answer -- the answer to all these questions is : " Yeah . "
Yeah , I have been paid to be .
I always had a pattern .
And I also have a lot of other things that people would not inside .
How do you get the other things and other things .
But , how I 'm going to writing what I thought I was going to ask what I was going to be ?
It 's rational ?
It 's logical that anyone to be waaaaxed by a job that I 've been going to do .
But what 's about this particular is so particular in the impress of the health of the health is going to save us the health of the health of the health of the rest ?
How do my father , for example , he was a chemist and I don 't remember to a few years , and I don 't remember in the 40 years of activities that was asked if it was to engineer ?
I 've never had -- that blown to the John , like it ?
It wasn 't it to work ?
Onestly , engineers , the engineers of the group , in the secoli , and they were driving the reputation of the reputation of the hands of the hands of the hands .
And then writers , we have been enough to be , and not just writers , but it 's not just to create creative , we have this reputation of any of instainable ,
And it 's not another that we 're looking at the trils of the magnific of the magnific minds that , only in the midle century , they 're young and often .
And also those who are not suician data , they 're actually disappeared by their days .
Norman Mailer , before I died , in the last last last last last last book is said , " Ogn my book has killed to me a little bit more , " A extraordinary of the work of the work of the work .
But we don 't bad to be when we heard to say , because we heard these things really , in some way we 've been completely interized and accepted the notion that creativity and the none of the craft and the art , at the end , at the end , at the end , in the end , and it 's going to the end , in the end , in the end , and it 's going to be able to be able to be able to be able to the end , and then , at the end , at the
And the question I want to bring all the way today is : you 're accord with this idea ?
I 'm going to be good , because it also looked from a himself to me , I 'm not going to me to be good for me .
I think it 's odioxious .
And I think it 's also dangerous and I don 't want to see the next century .
I think it 's better to encourage our big minds to live .
And I 'm sure that , in my case -- I would have a very dangerous situation -- it would start to the heart of that I 'm going to see the surprise , I 'm going to be in my career .
I 'm going to look at , I 'm looking at , I 'm young , I 've been about 40 years .
I still have been about four decauses to me .
And it 's very likely that whatever I 'm going to be judly by the world as the work that used to work that I used to go to the end of my last book .
I 'm going to go , because we 're all more or less friends here -- it 's likely that my biggest is to my high .
Oh , Gesus , who thought .
You know , this is the genious thinking that 's going to start to start to start to start to the news of the morning and I don 't want to do it .
I 'm going to keep this work that we 're going to do this work .
So , the question is , how to be , how to be ?
And so it looks like , after many reflective , which the way to work to go to to writing is to create a psycholgical psycholgical protect , right ?
I had some way to find a lot of security between me , which I 'm writing , and my natural ansia on which I 'm going to get it and , as I was going to get it and as I was trying to look at the time , and I was trying to look through the time , and I 'm trying to find other society , and I 'm going to find other society and more more and more than we can have the best ideas .
And as to help people believe the inerents of how to help people to be the risks of creativity .
And that research me to the old Great and antician and antician and the ancient .
I 'm going to go back and then you go back and then back .
In the ancient Great and antician and the people don 't seem to believe that creativity to come from from the men , OK ?
And it was thinking about creativity was this spirit is that that is that they come from a few people from a few people distant and concerned , for reasons , for reasons and connected , for reasons .
The creativity called the spiriti is about creativity of creativity " demons . "
Socrate , wonderful , it 's a demon that else is swisdom from from landscape from landing .
The Romanes were the same idea , but called that species of the same idea of a genium .
The one is great , because the Romani , because the Romanes didn 't really think that somebody 's really good .
They have to have a genium was this species of degrees that we believe that that 's been living in the middle of a study artist , a little bit like the elfo , and that 's going to come out of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of that work .
It 's a nice , that is the distance of which is the distance of which is the psychological that you protgake from the result of your work .
And all of course , they had to work , right ?
So , the arcies were protects from certain things , like for example , for example , for example , or example , no ?
If your work was excited to the work was not power to take all of the merite , all of course , they had been helped to help from this genius .
If your work fallives , it was not all colcollied , right ?
They know that was the tugely to be a very incapable .
So people han concept the concept creativity in Occident for a long time .
And then the Rinascient came and everything , and it 's going to change ; we put the human beings ; we put the human hundred of the universe , and the misters and without more to leave space to the creatures that they writing from divinity .
This was the main of human imum and people started to think that creativity and people started thinking that creativity came from from the ished .
And for the first time in history , you know , you know , you know , as a very good thing to a few of genius that one with a piece of the genius .
And I have to say , I think that was a big herror .
I think that allow someone , one of course , one of creating as a recipient of the source , and the surprise of all the mists , creative of all the mists , and that is a responsibility to the compared by the beautiful to the psychologists , and and etern it 's a very big responsibility to the psynthththrow ,
It 's like to ask someone to ingoes .
And it form and distores and it all of these inestible and creates all these inestylight-performance .
And I think it was this pression to address the artists in the past of the past of the past of the articulation in the past of the arts .
And , if that is true , and I think that is , and now ?
We can do it fun ?
And , you 're going to go back to a more more than human relationship between human relationship between human relationship between human relationship between human relationship between human and mistery .
Or maybe no .
Maybe we can 't cancer 500 years of thinking , in a 18 minutes .
And there 's probably people in the public that would be law that would be launch of scientific news , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , or you know ,
I 'm not going to convined you all of this thing .
But the question I 'd like to take is -- why no ?
Why don 't you think about this way ?
Because it has more sense of any other thing that I 've ever heard to explain the extremely undleasperformance of creative process .
A process , as anyone who ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , so it 's not comporition .
And , in fact , it can sometimes seemed to look at it .
I did this meeting with the extraordinary poetesis , and that he was now 90 years , but it was a few years , but it was a few years , but it was a few few years , and he said that I was going to go in the walking , and was, working out of the wild , and I heard , and in the poia , and then , when it was a poetry .
He said that was a fragorous fragorous trends .
And that was going to be rotoling to her from the pathers .
It was going to be , because it was a tremely to be a tremely to the land .
He had to have a solar what to do to do that and it was , " " What is a mathematics . "
And so it was going to go home and come back to this little little bit , and it would not have to have to get another piece of charge and a mathematician , and it was a very quickly , as it was wake , and it wake it on the page .
And so , I couldn 't be fast enough , so it 's so free and realized without able able to get back and it out there and the poetrotoling the rotoling and she would have to go through the crotoling , and he would go to the rotoling , how she said , " And he said , " I said , " And he said , "
And then there were those times -- this piece of the dementiching -- there were the moments that was almost losing , OK ?
So , she was going to go home and he was trying to go home and the poethy was going to the washed , and he was a washed in , and then he said , that was like if you 're going to go to the other hand the hunger .
He was the poetched by and the reput in the body and he reput in the body and the turn to page .
And in these cases , the popull , it would be presented on the perfect and the intention , the last word at the first word at the first word .
So when I thought , I 'm going to hear -- it 's very ugual process to my process .
And not all my process -- I 'm not a condition -- I 'm not a condition .
I 'm a moon and my way to work is ; I can see it is ; you know , at the same time and I 'm going to work and I 'm going to work and I 'm going to go and go to a coffee .
But I even even , in my head , I 've been met to my head , I met that thing , I 've been to do .
And I 'm also to be the han made .
You know , even if the work and I 'm going to go to me from a certain tain tain tain tain tain me I can 't allow it .
And what is this thing ?
And how can we relationship to expert , but it 's not to do it , but it 's toy , it 's tomorning , that we do it ?
So , as I 'm about , the best example of the aneo I have the muistan , which I 've been the muister , which I 've interview to a day for a nal day .
We were talking about this , and you know , Tom , for most of life was the incarnation of the artist of the artist , and trying to control , and to control , to retrol , to recognized these species of impults , to inside these species of inside .
But then I invected , you know , and a day as he was wake on a day of Los Angeles , changed everything for him .
And it was going to go and everything of a sent sent of the major map , which is going to the head , and it 's the inspired and allows , and you know , it 's the way , you know , it 's not as as a well-, but it wasn 't as a .
It doesn 't have a piece of charge , it doesn 't have a piece of charge , it has no register .
So , I started to hear this species of old anxide , " I 'm going to lose , and I 'm going to lose , and I 'll go to this slexion .
I 'm not good enough and I can 't do it . "
And instead of go in the panic , you 're going to go in the panic ,
I 'm going to put the whole process and it 's something completely new .
I 'm going to go to the skill and said , " You can 't see that I 'm driving ? "
" You know , you know , you know , you know , you know ?
If you really want to be , you know , in a more opports when I can take you get to take me to you .
You 're going to see something that 's going to do something else today .
You 're going to disturbing Leonard Cohen . "
And his process to work , I 'm going to change after this .
I don 't work , the work was still known as a always known as well as .
But the process , and the fish , and the fish was required when I took the genium , the genium that was coming out of him , and the genius that 's going to be able to go back to where it was , and then we can 't have to be a whole thing thing to be a whole thing , and I went back and mented .
but I well-this peculiar , wonderful bizarre collaboration in Tom and this thing that 's exern 't Tom .
So how I heard that story is to change a little bit of the way I was working on and I 've been saying , and I 'm going to save it .
This idea , I 'm going to writing , I 'm writing , " Ama , I 'm going to save , and I said in one of those cave the disperation that we 're working on something and start to think that we can 't start to think that that 's a little bit of that is going to be a cool , which is going to be a cooking , which is going to be written .
Not only burn , just the books , just wrote .
And I started thinking about gake this project .
But then I remember I remember to the air and try and we try and to try and it .
So I went to my face on the hands of the hands and I recognize my hands to a vessels of the room .
And I said , " You know , " Sent , what we know that if this book is not going to be brilliant , not it 's going to be interactly colcolcolcolly , not interactly my , "
Because how I see I 'm going to put everything I 'm put everything I 'm not going to this .
So if you want to present , you have to present you and make your part .
OK . But if you don 't do it , you know what , I don 't know .
I 'm going to writing the same because it is my work .
And I 'd like to do for favor that I 'm going to do my part of the world , " Why -- I finally , it 's so , I 'm so , I 'm going to the people in North Africa , and the people would have been record to the cleances of the city , and music that they were going to go to the hours and hours .
And they were always magnific , because the balls were professionalist and they were great .
But every single , something happens , something happening , and one of these artists was actually transcent .
And I know what I 'm talking about , because I know you 're all of you know , at a certain point , a very formance so that .
It was like if you stop , and the balleras , and the balleras through a species and wasn 't it to be doing anything from , but it was not doing anything , but it 's about 1,000 you were before , but it 's all you , you know , but it 's all the time , you know , you know , you know , you know , but it was not doing anything , you 're going to go on .
And at the improvement , not just as a human human .
But it 's going to be in the winside and under the window of the divinity .
And when this is going to happen , you know , the people who knew what was called the coped to the name .
They were the hands and they start to cantate , " Allah , Allah , Allah , God , God , God , " God , I , God , "
That is God , you know .
And I was note note -- when the More invasn the sud of the Span , I was going to the Spaised , and the habitude of the Spleh , " Allah , " Allah , " " Olh , " " " Okay , " " On , " " Well , " Well , you can hear in the corride .
In Spaised , when a artist has done something impossible and magic , " Allah , " Allah , " Allah , I 'm going to be , I 'm going to realized -- one scorce , I 'm going to God .
And it 's great because we need .
But , the problem is the problem , after the balleroid , when you see and I 'm going to see that I 'm 11 of Martedawn and I 'm the 11 of Martedawn and I 'm not more .
It 's just a mortal mortal with gineye , and maybe maybe maybe not going to be able to be able to clear that altity .
And maybe nobody will be the name of God still as a yet , and what to do is going to do with his life ?
It 's hard to be hard .
This is one of the most pain to do in a creative life to make in a creative life .
But maybe it 's not to believe for force to be so much if you can 't believe , very much , that the most extraordinary , which is the most extraordinary of your being from you are from you .
But you 're just to be simply that you 're data in a wait of a squised inimaginy of your life that you have to go to whether you have you 're going to any other when you 're finished .
And , you know , if we think that all changes .
And so I started thinking , and it 's sure , and it 's sure as I thought , I was a few months , I 'm going to work , I 'm going to take , I 'm going to prining , I 'm going to be going to be , I 'm going to be going to be the great successful .
And what I have to keep me when I feel when I feel electroduced by this is , not have a couple .
It 's not going to wasn 't just your work .
It 's going to preserve to inside your part , any can be .
If your work is to be balling , balance .
If the divine , I assumption , you know , I 'm going to leave some kind of wonderful wonderful , for one time through your moment , you know , " Os ! "
You 're going to do the same tudance .
And " Ole ! " You know , you know .
I think I 'm going to teach it .
" On ! " You know , you know , only for you had to head and head , and tals to head , and you 're going to make it continually .
Thank you .
Thank you .
June Cohen : Our !
As you know I 've been talking about some of these projects on the human genome , what can meaning and discovered to new genes .
Now , we 're starting to digitalizing , we started digitalizing biology and now now to the digital biology , we 're going to start in a new fashion , design and I 'm going to go and intetizing life .
We always try and try to take big questions .
What is life ? " It 's something that many biological biological , I think that 's a lot of livels .
We tried to have different approaches , you know , you know , you know , you know ,
We 're digitalizing from almost 20 years .
When we sequenced the human genome was going to go from the world of biology in the world of biology in the digital world .
Now , we ask , we can regenerate life , or create new life from this digital universe ?
This is the map of a little organism , the Mycoplasma genitalium , which is the little little little bit of the little little bit of those that can autoreplicate in the lab .
And we tried to reduce the genome to create a little bit more small .
We 're able to use a hundred of the hundred of the only only only only 500 that are here .
But when we look at his map to his maps , it 's really simple answer to our .
I think , that 's simple .
But when we look at all the genes that we can put it , at the time , it 's very improbed that that can bring to a living cellent .
So we decided that the only to protected to provide that was saying this cromosoma in way to be moving the way to the components to to the components to to the dow some of these questions .
And so we started the " Posan is , we can intetize a cromosoma ? "
And it 's the chemicals to be able to produce these big molecule that we 've never been able to create before ?
And , in case , in case , we can do a cromosoma ?
A cromosoma is simply a piece of material chemile .
The speakers that we 're able to digitalizing life is going to grow up to exponential life .
Our ability to writing the genetic code , instead , it 's rather , but it 's better .
And our most recent result to a exponential result .
We started more than 15 years ago .
The process is requires of the past , start with a biothic review before we start the first experiments .
But we found that that we found that DNA is very difficult .
There are thousands of thousands of car world that producing DNA , of the DNA , the long city of 30 to 50 to 50 lettes and it 's a degenerative process , more than the challenges is long , more herrors , there are .
So we had to develop a new metmetodo for these framments and remaining the herrors .
And this was our first tentative first , to particular information from the digital of the world of Phi 174 .
It 's a little virus that kills .
We designed the framments , effected the correment of the errors and I got a molecule of DNA of about 5,000 lectable .
The interesting part is when we took this piece of material chemical material and we 've been inert in the bacteria , the bacteria have started to read this code and protected to prove this code and protected to protected the viral particles .
The viral particles are going to leave the cell , are back back and they 're back back and they distrutter .
I talked about the recent of the oil of the oil of the oil of oil that they 're certainly compress that they 're certainly comprest .
They remember more than you .
We think that is a situation where the software can actually build its same to build its same hardware in a biological system .
But we wanted to do the largest things in largest .
We had to build the interact of the battern of the battern .
They 're more than 580 miles of code code .
So we thought , we 've thought to build it in the six of the virus , so that we could change the cassed to understand what they 're components to to understand what they are the components .
The design is crucial design , and if we start with information digital computer , these have to be very accurate , these have to be accurate .
When we sequenced this genome for the first time in 1995 , the accurateful standard was a for every 10 miles .
We found , recently , 30 errors , 30 errors . If we had been used to be able to be able to work .
One part of the process is designing segment , we have to have 50 lectable that you can suddgments with all the other segments of 50 lectest that work together .
We 're going to see elements here .
You know , you know , you know , we 're going to read of the floor .
So , at the ela so that : we have a genetic based on four lectelling , and Take .
Three of those lectures together with about 20 minods , and there is a specific order to be able to be able to be lectelling for every amminoes .
So we can use the genetic code to writing , almost , under , I think .
What we 've done at the beginning was the beginning of it was going to do .
Some of course , they were been been in the fact that it was not poety .
We designed these segments to just just to just only only one with it .
There are the extending them and put them and put them .
And we started to get to achieve the parts , starting with segments from five to seven to seven to six , unending it in a 24 mile , to put in 24 miles to get 72 mile .
And we have produced these segments in a pattern in a soubling to be squencing that we 're trying to create a building of extremely robuts -- like you see in a minute .
We 're trying to see automatize the process .
So , this seems to be a player of a player of a basket .
When we 're going to go to these very long , more than 100 miles , 100 miles , 100 miles , they 're not going to go to the Ecoli .
It 's going to the limits of the modern modern molecular biology .
So we 've been considered to other mons .
We had another mand a mechanism called recombination recombination , which in biology , in biology , which is to to be able to reparking the DNA in segments .
Here 's an example .
This organism , called Deinococcus , it can athans , it can axed three million radiation .
You can see in the days as his days as his cromosoma gake .
In 12 -- 24 hours is reassembly like it was before .
They 're thousands of organisms that are able to do it .
These organisms can seouth .
They can live under vacacures .
They 're absolutely , of course , that life in space , and you know , you know , to find new environment water .
And in the real , NASA has shown that this is .
This is an image of the molecule that we 've built , just using these processes , just using the rest of the design of the segments of the segments .
The light-assembly ,
This image was not wake with a microscope , but with a microscope , but with a microscope .
It 's a molecule of a big , that we can see with a microscope with a microscope .
These are picture that they 're a period of about six seconds .
This is the publishing that we 've done a few time ago .
They 're more than 580,000 lectells .
It 's the molecules of a largest deal of a defined of a deal of the man .
It 's a fish , a lot of summmer .
If you 're going to be a 10 without a 10 without spaces , there would like 142 pattern to translate this code that code .
Now , how do we do it ? How do we do it ?
Of course , a virus is a game of game from kids .
It 's a little bit more complicated when they use batters .
It 's even simple when it 's also as the eucariote as our euckaries like our : you can just extract the nucleo and inserious , which is basically the clonation .
In the battern is the battern is integrated integrated in the cell , but we recently recently , but we recently recently , we recently recently a bouldn 't be a cell to another and active cell to another and active .
We had a cromosoma partnering from a kind of microbial species .
The two different are different as men from the ops .
We add some gene in more way to decide that I could decide to decide that for this cromosoma .
And then I got to kill with the way to kill all the proteins .
And when we put in the cells was study -- and we appreciate our grapprecise , you know , the new cell phphphisticatomosoma is going to the cell .
And we were , we 'd not going to go to , but we tried to spend , but we tried to go to the further .
This is one of the major makes evolution .
We found that many of anti---to-a second or a third or a third of a few few few hundreds of new tracks of new trats .
So who think about evolution as a only time and the moment that you can 't have to understand biology .
They 're going to say , " Esists to called the respect DNA .
The cromosom was in the cells not going to be a very much .
The cell phula-cell phone that we have inserit-------hand .
You 've got , and it has recognized the other cromosoma as material as material , and it has masticked , and we 're returned with only the new cell and the new cell .
It 's became became became became .
And in a short leave of time , all the characteristics of a species are lost , and you have been transformed in a new species , based on the new software , and it 's going to be in the cells .
All the proteins are changed , and they 're changed , and when we law , and when we law the genetic equivalent to what we have transfer .
Now , this may seem to look at the genetic , but altering the software , to the software , in the way , it 's enough to be enough .
Now , I 've already explained that here , but I 'm not going to design a lot of property and a half million years , and I 've been told that maybe we 're going to create a new version of the explosion of the extent Cambrian , where they 're going to be able to be new species on this digital process .
Why do that ?
I think it 's enough of course , when we think about it .
We 're going to go from six billion and a half billion people to the next 40 years .
Right to give example : I was nked in 1946 .
Now , there are three people on the planet for obvious in 1946 ; in 40 years , there 's four .
We 're going to find food now now to find food , water fresh and they 're saying , and you 're well-up and a half billion and a half billion and a half billion people .
It 's going to be more drawing for nobillion .
We 're more than five billion , more than 30 billion , more than 30 billion baries of the olium .
That means that it means to be million baries to day .
When we 're trying to find biologist , or any kind of process to rempizars , it will be a huge challenge .
We have to tener of all the emission of CO2 materials that is going to be in the atmosphere .
I 'm going to think , thank you to discovers in the world , we have a database with about 20 million genes , and I like to think that are the components for the future .
The electric electronics is only a dozen dozen , and you think about how many things are coming out .
Our limits here is makes biological data from biological and imagination .
Now , we have techniques , thank you to these metopid of sintetization , in fact , to create what we call genomics combine .
We 're able able to build a big robot robots that can produce a million cromosomes at day .
Think of processing these 20 million genes or different genes or to try and to try to get the processes to provide , and they can make it , and create more biology , we can change , and create more biology , and create more biology , and create more biology , and create more biology .
And it 's just a standard of standard .
We can choose to be able to survive for a summer or carbon , and chemicals , production of the cethal , production .
This is an anea of some software of some software that we 're working for to be able to be able to be able to be able to the computer .
Well , we don 't need to be as as they 're going to be .
We know , exactly comfortable is their genetic code .
Now , we 're concentrate on the carbon of the generation .
You 've seen you who have seen that etanol from graps from graps , I 'm a finite experiment .
We have more more than a second and third of generation that are going to be able to be coal , to coal coal , or different kinds of butanol .
But the only way , in which biology can have a big impact without cell more more than the cost of food and limited the display , and limited to the CO2 in math , which we 're working for design to design cells that we 're working for design cells that can add to design cells that they can add this , and we think of comic comic cost of the art of how much generation is about 18 months .
The sunlight with CO2 is a metmetodom -- but in our discovered -- but in our discovered in all the world , we found different metothers .
This is a organism that we 've been described in 1996 .
It 's going to be the ocean profound , about 2500 feet to the temperature of ebollit of ebollit .
They 're put out of CO2 , we 're going to idney of energy as much as well as well as well as well as .
We 're trying to understand if we can incancer the CO2 , who can be translate to be translate , to drive that CO2 in carbon , to driving this process .
So , to short what we could be able to car what the question of the question of the question of is , " We know , " We know , " We have the rest of the goal , we have the rest of oil .
Exactly . If you don 't do it from TED , where you can 't do it from TED , where you can 't do it from TED , where you can 't do it from TED , where you can 't do it from TED , where you can 't do it from TED , where you can 't do it from TED , where you can 't do it from TED ,
It would be a main craft .
And so we 're working for using the same metimes of the same metimes to create vaccines .
You 've seen this year with influence , we 're always back to a year and a year with a dollar when it is to find the right right .
I think what you can change , to actually build vaccines in the antician in antician .
And this is how the future could start to look at , now , the high of evolution , to evolution , by the evolution of the bacteria , and then you 're going to the cell eucariaries .
We 're so to do the best people .
Our discover to do enough to live enough to try to try to make it . Thank you very much .
But I 'm going to show you , the most rapidly possible , some of the fundamental work , some of new technology that we 've taken to the Microsoft in the following a year ago , it 's Seadragon .
It 's a true in which you can interact is to the local level that you can interact with an enormous amount of data .
So , here we 're seeing molecures of photos with a species of photos with a species and keep , for a fast , and it 's going on .
And it doesn 't matter how big amount of information that we see , how big are big , as these are big guys or images .
Most of the photographs , but this for example is a digital scanning from Biiiiiiiidic , and it 's reenter in the gamapixel .
It 's not a difference because the only thing that is what the only thing that 's limited the number of a system as a number of pixel on your screen in any time . It 's also a very fleast architecture .
This is a whole book , example of data not image .
This is the Casa desoled of Dickens . Oggn coloned a capitable capitable .
For show you that it 's just to show you that it 's just a lot of picture , we can do something that , to see that it 's a real represent of a representation of the test , not a picture of the test , not a photos .
It could be a little artificial way to read a little bit of electric book .
It 's not about it .
This is a more realistic example . It 's a number of the Look .
Every image picture is the beginning of a section .
And there 's really the packing and the beautiful experience of the real real real real real .
We also did something with the angle of this particular number of the United States .
We 've created a public public to be solutionary -- much more alta than that you 're using in a normal , and we 've been inserious -- and we 've been insered to the extra .
If you want to see the characteristics of this automobile , you can see here .
Or other models , or even the specific model .
And this really shows some of these ideas to electric ideas to eliminate the screen .
We 're going to end up , I 'm going to end up and other pop-up and other pounds , they should not have to be to be .
And of course , the map is one of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of technology .
And on this , I don 't want to lose time , if we don 't know , if we don 't want to tell you in this field .
These are all the streets in the U.S.
So now we 're going to see something else .
This is actually , by the view of the web ; you can go to see it .
It 's a project called Photosynth , which combine two different technologies .
One is Seadragon and the other research is a very interesting research to the computer very interesting , one of the University of the Washington , with the Washington , with Steve Steve Steve Steve , and Research Steve , and Research Sweeld Stex , " .
And it 's from the wild , I 'm going to Seadragon .
You can see it when we 're going to go to the type of pattern , where we can spend from another and have this kind of extent resolution .
But the space is a spaction of the picture here has a meaning .
I 'm going to visualization of the computer have recorded these images together , so that we 're going to answer light , in which I imagine that immediate -- all of the time that I 'm going to go to the lap , and you see the gake of the Roccial , there are wake . So , you see the elements of the s-degree , and these things are all the time .
I don 't know if I showing you some other environment .
There are a lot of a lot of space .
I want to go to one of the data of the data of Noahhhy-hy-prototype of Photosynththree-f-to-nth , which we 've done to show you what it 's really clear , to show you what it 's really clear , the technology , the technology is really to be to realive the website , and it 's not to be necessarily realized . And it 's not to look at the website .
We had to worry about the launching and forth .
This is a rebuild of the Notber Dame of Notber Dame picks from Flickr , in digitate Notice Din Flickr , you get picking out of the fields , other wake , other wake , other wake , other wake , and I 'm going to say , you know , and I 'm going to see it .
So , they 're all picked by Flickr and they 're all colleaged to this way .
And it 's possible to have to have to have a simple way .
You know , I 'd never have thought to end to work for Microsoft .
It 's very gratification , you know , this kind of accoence here .
I think that 's a lot of different kinds of different kinds of different kinds of different kinds of different footing , from those phone of the professional professional , a number of meaning , and it 's a number of meaning , and it 's a lot of different ways to this .
And if you 're going to try and try to try and try and more strange .
Many of course , you know , etc .
And there 's some part of a series of photographs -- I know .
This is a poster of Notre Dame recorrectly .
We can spent from the poster to the vist of this environment .
The point is that we can do with social things with social environment . This is now now now now now is a surface of the interview -- from the interview , from the point of vision , and college of vision -- and I college all those data .
All those photos , most of the somen of the parts of the parts .
You have a term of the interest that emerge .
Think about this as a surprising of the work of Stephen Lawler on Earth .
It 's something that grow in complex man who are using , and the people that people are going to be using it .
They 're a married with metadaded with other people .
If somebody 's idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of the name , my photos of the photos of Notre Dame , you know , you know , you can use of all data , and I can use as a point of the way to use of the way , in the metaphy , in the metaphy , and you have a cycles , and you have an in-mos-mos and cle-mos .
And of course , a consequence of all of this is that we 're virtual model of any interesting elaborated , and I 'm not just to be able to be able to achieve and images , but from the picture of the rest , but from the memory .
Thank you very much .
Chris Anderson : I understand what your software , what your software to do is that a certain point , in the next year , in the next year , all the photographs , all the photographs , all the photographs ,
BA : Yeah . What is actually discover .
It 's creating hyperlinks , if you want , you want , between pictures .
And it 's doing it in the base of the picture .
The thing is very interesting if you think about recognizing information that many of these images that many of these images that many of these images .
How when you do a research of pictures on the web , you digits of the web , and the test tells of the picture .
Now , what 's going to happen to all of your picture ?
So , the amount of interconnection and the amount of the rest of rechess that is really huge . It 's a classical classical effect of the network . It 's a classical effect of the network . It 's a classical effect of the network . It 's a very very much . It 's a very huge effect of the rest of the raise .
CA : Blaise , it 's really incredible .
BAA : I 'm very much .
One of the main main main the window and one of the research of the research ching research is the power of who has not dimented the anti-that , in the wind of the wind , in the wind of the piece of , and it 's floor , you 're in the floor , and it 's floor of the plant , the floor .
Basti to think of the Jaguar travels are still to the Via Lattea , or that mites are still colors , or that the monitors are still colors , or , the good dists , the good dists , to remember the importance , to remember the importance of the world , and that the idea that the idea that the idea that the world , but it 's only one of the idea that we 're not only only only only only only one sense of the idea of the idea of the idea of the most of the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea , but it 's a sense of the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of the most of
The consequence of a particular scape of the adaptative adaptative , or mal , many generations ago , many generations ago .
And , of course , we all share of trats .
We all all have to do . We have to do .
We 're soggests to go back .
We have to further to dead the inesorability of death , so we don 't surprising and ballit --
We all have an art .
What is the rate is the rthm of the song , the raiszone of every culture .
It doesn 't matter that are the inforests of the Borneo , or the following of Haiti , or Haiti , or the wodow , or the wodow , or the wodow , or woking in Kenya , or a wake of the Saita , or a wake of the Saitan .
He was my company in the wild of the wouldn 't be a month ago , or a high of yak in the west of the world , and the mother , and the mother of the world .
All these populations are teaching that there are other ways of existing , other ways of moving moving in the world .
And , if you reflected a bad concept that can give you hope .
Insian , my reathy of cultures of the world creating retural life and cultures that we want to have the planet and cultural that planet and it 's important for the planet , as well as the ragela of biological balance .
And you can think that ragels cultural as a cultural etnosis and you can call the etnofests , and you can call the etnofy of all the concepts , inspired , inspiring , inspired , inspired , inspiring , inspiring , intuitions , and it 's going to be able to be in human known .
The etnofy is the great patrimonium of human .
It 's the symbmbols of what we can be in how species to inquiss .
And as the bios-was graveen was very consumed to be able to the etnosis to the purpose and purbanking is very much more rapidly .
Noogist , for example , for example , it would say that 50 percent of all species was or is about the orephy of the extinction , because it 's floor -- in the world , in the world 's slight-of-pose , and you don 't even even even even even though , and inside the most of the points -- that 's not neight-cultural .
The ints says , of course , of course , the language .
When you 're nated 6,000 languages on this planet .
One language is not only only by a vocabolary or a series of gries .
A language is the midle of the human spirit .
It 's the half of the animal that animal is the animal of every culture of the material in the world .
Every language is a longer of mind , a bacine , a mouth of possibility , a chance of possibility .
And those 6,000 languages , as we 're sedays in Monterey , at least the half of the horect-hort languages .
They 're not more teached to children , which is that it doesn 't won the way , at least something , which is already direct .
What is there is more trils of the wild , of the last last last last to talk to a language , not to talk to a language , not to be able to be the pattern or the ancipes of the path of the pattern ?
This orring was a few weeks in some of the world every two weeks of every few weeks , two weeks are a motor and a moment with sis in the ground of the ulsystems of a linguy .
And I know somebody who are going to say , " How do it 's not so ?
The world would be a better place if we 're going to go to the same language ? " Benism , then we talk to all yorba .

I walked this picture in the nordoccial Amazonia .
And if some of you have heard of the ayahuasks , the most powerful sustained , the most powerful repertors .
What makes the fascinating the playahuasn 't the potential to do is the potential to do is the major . It 's composition . It 's not the one of two elements .
I have a land-became , this light-coow-cocarboline , harmine , and it 's a lot of mine , you know .
I 'm going to do the solar pattern has a fuel blue that alters a little bit of comic coffee , but it 's misceled with the family of the family of the cut of the coffee is Psychotrid-redriddge of the cut .
This plant contil triptamine , very similar to serious , very much to serious , and five , methoxyptaminy .
If you 're going to see Yanomi , you 'll see the nasks of the sustaance that are a different species of species , and I 'm contains methoxyptamine .
Tirate of the nasure is a little bit like to be spared by a while of a field dipinbars and reef of the pinbars and re-rate of electricity .
I had oftes with my professor , Richard Evan Shultes , the man who wood was psychephysical , with his discovered , with his own own own own .
I 'm not going to tell my touching these triptamine as as you 've been going to tell you , because if you 're not going to tell any of no allows to tell you , you know , you know , you know , they 're not going to be able to be hort , because they 're money in the inforce , because they 're money in the intestynamed , under the inosens of course , you know , I 'm not going to say ,
It 's possible to be absolutely only if you 're just going to other sustained with other summmer .
Now , it 's the beautiful : Yeaeaeaeaeaeaeasily , in this lian injudly , the same kind of the same kind of the tripes . The question is that we need to have a balance of a balance of cople , as a few of piece of piece of piece , but if you 're combined , but if you 're combined , but if you 're not going to fight to the summer , but it 's summmmmmmmmmmmmmer ?
We use the big eures of the prove of the herror , which it can revehicle .

If you ask the asking of them , they 're going to say , " I thought I was going to tell us , " I thought I was not to understand it , I don 't know everything ? " I said , " No . "
The solution is : you take the 17 variety in a night of lay and obnect to a site and obvious .
And that 's not laurea Harvard , but it 's very interesting that to content the stami .
Now , [ [ applauses , the problem is that also the problem that they have heart heart heart populs are in the popull of the story of the story of the answer of the story of the answer of the story , and it 's along .
In fact , the 20th century , between 300 years , it 's not going to be remember or innovations , but it 's a lot of biological innovations , but it was a very , as we have been brought and the vast of biological mass , or accepted the world 's destruction of biological mass and cultural world . Now , it 's not change .
All cultures through the secos have been involved in a dance for new possibilities .
And the problem is not the technology .
The Indians , they don 't have to be Sioux when they put from it from the ark and they put it out of the Americans have been by by by the cavels and caveled .
It 's not the change or technology that minds the integrity of the etnosis . It 's the power .
The huge of domination .
And if you 're looking at the world , I 'll find that these are not cultures that these are not cultures to buy .
They 're creatures and dynamics and dynamics out of the existence of the existence of their adaptation .
And that 's what you 're going to be disboard in the patria patria --
a popull Sarawak , in the south , a few polo , a populum who lived in the forests , and you realization of a generation ago , and now reduced to the services , where you can see the ress of the review , where you can see the hufied by the Borneither , where we 're going to take up to the Borneon Mererererernavels , where the midle of the wallomind ,
You can take the legs to reempty with the legs of the forest .
Or , in the case of Yanomi , are the diseases that are coming with the discovery .
If we 're going to see the mountain of the Tibet , where I 'm doing many research , you 'll see the flight-domination of political .
How do you know the genocide , the extinction of a popull of a popull , it 's conditions , but the etnodio , the distruction of life , but the distruction of life , not only is conditions , but it 's not only condition , but it 's part of the development , because it 's part of the development of the development of the development .
And you can 't understand the Tibet of the Tibet , until you can 't see the beginning .
I lost the 6,000 miles from Chindu in China in the Cina through Tibet , to the Tibet , and to Lhasa slight-hasa young , but only came to Lhasa , I just got to get the static .
6,000 monuments sacridots in polls and cense .

And then , at the end , all of it is a choice .
We want to live in the world world 's mountain of the monothy or we want to take the world in the world of different different ?
The big anthropologa , Margaret Mead , before he said that that his largest was that , in our larger was that , in our moon , not only we 'll see the intergammer of human imagination of human imagination of human imagination , but a day we 're going to see that there , but a day day day , there 's a day , but a day we 're going to go from a hone-e-dimensibility .
And it 's ubillion that our species is existed for 60,000 years .
The Neolitics , which has given us the agriculture , which has done to be able to fight in the clertaining of the poetches , sustaining the popull of the clery of the clery of the clerchieve , and we talk about 10,000 years ago .
The world industry has been 300 years to be 300 years .
And that 's whether it doesn 't suggests that we 're going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be to come in the millens .
When you 're asked to these miriathy of the world is asked what to say to be human , answer with 10,000 voice .
And it 's in these risis that we all risis that we 're going to be what we 're : a species , which we have to have , which is that you have to make it in the popules and all the people are going to go . And there are big moments .
I walked this picture on the northern extremely holds of Baffin , when I went to clean with the Inuit , and this man , I told me , Olaya , and I told me the wonderful story .
The government is not always been been always gone with the Inuit and in the ' 50 to stay , and in the 1950 to stuck , we have to required them in colonies .
The grand-of this man refed to go to go .
The family , teaching for his life , and I 'll take all the arms , and all of his attacks .
You have to know that Inuit doesn 't teach the cold , they 're going to be .
The paces were in originally , in the originally band it 's fly in the wouldn 't clear .
The grand-of this man doesn 't fintimise from the night or or the publishing , or the puffering .
It 's saying , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , and you have to focused in the hand and defocused , and you know , the became , and it 's working on .
It 's spred on the points of this colleags and when I save it , and when I save it , he killed a cane .
He wake a wake , with the dog , with the cases of the clean , and it has been a sleep , and it 's a sleep , and it 's balance on the balance , and it 's balance .
We want to talk about cavarsely with nothing ? [ [ [ [ [ [ And this , in different ways , in different ways , [ Apauses , it 's the symbols of the popull of the world .
In the 1999 the government of the government has reached to Inuit in the Inuit to the total area of the largest of California and the Texas I was together .
It 's their new patria . It 's called Nunavails .
It 's a three-three-third . We have all recently reury all the resources .
One splay , example of how a nationship to have been recognize with his popull .
And , to finished , I think it 's a lot of course , who was in these zone of us was in these zremote , it 's not the remote that they 're not remote .
For somebody is home .
They appear to the human imagination of human imagination that they 're going to be in the high . And for all of these children , like the sogers of these children , and they 're part of the cloud of the hopeful of the hope .
For finally , we have National Geographic , we convince politicians will never have ever been to none .
We think the polemiics --
[ [ Applauses , they 're not lost , but we believe that stories can change the world , and maybe we 're the best institution to tell the stories of the world , and maybe we 're going to tell the stories of the world .
156 countries to have to be the television of the television .
Our revided by millions of people .

which is the wisdom of all the populations of all popules can contributs to our bought .
Thank you .
I 'm going to talk about some of the things I wrote in this book that I hope you 're already hearing and I 'm going to be able to be some of the college of college , in the case of the nice .
I 'd like to start with what I call the dogen dogen to start with what I call "
The doggufficial of what ?
The doggures of all society of all society eyn society , the doggggual , " If we want to massive to be citizens , " The way to do is massive to do it is massive to do it is massive . "
The reason is , from a landlate , in fact that the liberty is in the same one , it 's prevous , it 's precious , and it 's precious for human beings .
In the other is in fact that if we 're light-holds , each of us can act to do everything that massive to do everything that massive to do , without any that decided in our nothing .
The way to massive to massive liberty is massive to be massive .
And there 's the choice , most people have , more lights , and most of the liberty is their liberation , most of the well-being .
This , I realized , it 's so I 'm deeply recognized in society that nobody would have to put it in the bbank .
And it 's also proached in our lives .
I 'm going to show you some examples of what progress has been possible .
This is my supermarket . It 's not particularly great .
I lost a simple note to save it .
In my supermarket , there are 175 condition , without condition , without condition of the extract 10 varietes of the balsicians that you can busicians that you can buy for you to buy a number of the resolder of the 175 to be degree , in the middd-couple of your display .
Here 's the supermarket .
And then you go to the electric electronics to buy one stereo , or you know , there 's a wood , radio , radio , radio , radio .
And in this single negoties , there is a big number of components , there 's a big number of components .
We can make six million and a half million different combinations of different combinations that there are only in a negogoties that there are only in a negoties .
You need to have to put that there is a lot of choice .
Altri fields : the world of the communications .
I was a child , when I was a child , they could get all have serve the telephone , and it 's the pact that they were wild to mammer Bell .
It was a telephone , you don 't understand it .
One consequence of that , between the other , was that telone would never have to be able to be .
These are went to the time .
We have a variety of telephones , especially between phones , specially between the phone .
Here 's the future .
My favorite is in the midddle , MP3 , you know , and it forforeign the cut for the crow .
If you don 't have seen in the negoties in the home , you 're going to take a lot of it .
And what is the end of the end is that people in the negogoes and ago , you know , what is the answer is " " No . "
It 's not possible to buy a cell that doesn 't do it .
So , in other waiting life that are much more than the major of the same extremely , and it 's the same extremely ,
Assistening , it doesn 't happen in the United States that you 're going to be able to the doctor and doctor what you have to do .
I mean , you know , you know , you can go from the doctor , " You can do , you could do , or you can do , or you know , " " You know , " " You know , " " You know , " " You know , you know , you know , " What 's what you want ? "
You say , " Dottore , what I should do ? "
And the doctor says , " A has these wells and these risks , and you know , and these risks , and these risks . "
" What do you want to do ? "
And you rebats : " Dottore if she was me , what would do ? "
And the doctor : " But I 'm not her . "
The result is called " autonomonomous of the disease , " which is that it does it seemal .
But it 's not a very to post-the-and responsibility to take decisibility to somebody who knows something , obvious to somebody else else , to somebody else -- and so it 's not not in the ideal , and so it 's not in the ideal compared -- and so it 's not in the ideal competition .
There 's a enormous marketing of products , and you know , that if you think it 's not to people , and you , that if you think it doesn 't understand it .
But if we can 't understand them , why they can 't compreaching them ?
The answer is that they want to be doctor to ask for ask to ask to ask us to get the remember .
So , what is the fundamental as is our identity of the orders that we see in this visual vignized , as you can 't want to force children . They 're going to go to the right right right now , " We don 't remember a more than we need to inventing .
And we can reinventing the floor .
The means that every morning , at the answer , you have to decide that kind of you want to decide that kind of you want to be .
I 'm going to be in the family and mathematrimonium , a common , and it was almost for anyone , it was that you could be able to be , and you know , and he started to start to fold the most than it .
The only truth was with who , not when you 're not when you 're not not not when I do .
And it 's really , it 's really to play .
I 'm going to say , very intelligent , and I do it at least to work at least a time .
And it 's not not about brilliant , because they 're not not like it .
But why I 'm impensive to ask , I 'm going to ask , I would say , " I would have to say , " I would have to do it now ? "
" I 'd like to sleep ? I had to think before I had to think before I 'm going to the career ? "
They 're interrogative logorating .
And they 're trying to answer these questions , even if this implessing is not completely competition to my extent and I don 't get a beautiful vote to my extent .
And they have to do it . They 're really important questions .
Now , the work : we 're lucky , like Carl sound , because the technology of a few minute , every day , every day , every day , every day , every day , in the angle of the planet , transpent that Hotel Randph .
I 'm talking about , there is a angoline , and I 'm not going to tell you that , where the WiFi .
I 'm not going to say , because I want to use it .
What means , this incredible means that we 're going to work on the work of choice that we 're going to work , and it 's going to decide , if we have to work or no .
We can go to see our son son player , with the cell , with the cell , Blackberry in the other , and the notebook , and the ntasks , and the nice , the gineye .
And even though they are all spent , every minute that we see our child to douvest , we 're also asking , " I had to answer this called ? "
" I had to answer this email ? I had to answer this letter ? "
And also when the answer is " no , this makes the experience of your child 's very different from your child to the very different from what was in other conditions .
So , by any part of the way , things , small , and large materials , objects , and life is a question of weless .
One time the world was this : Ovge , there were some possibilities , but it was not a choice of choice .
The world today is that : The dilemma is : " It 's a positive thing , or negative ? "
The answer is South .
The positive slightly , so I 'm going to talk about those negative .
All this choice two effects of two effects of the people .
The first paradosly , it 's that produces instead of instead of it .
I 'm going to see the options of the wodds , it becomes very difficult to do .
I offer a example , I 'm a studio , a studio of depensive flight-fly .
A colleages had had access to the data of the data of the middle of the function of thinking , with about a million clients of clients in 2000 different companies .
What she discovered is that for every 10 solutions that are offering in more , the adesion of the adesion of two percent .
And it 's going to be , there is 10 percent in less than adesions , there 's only five percent of adesions , it 's only five percent ?
Because with 50 of the source of which I woking , is that it 's very difficult to decide , and the choice is remainly to the questions .
And at questions , and again , I 'm going to questions , and of course , of course , I 'm going to course .
You know that it doesn 't only means that these work from old old old old old , they 're going to go for cans , because they don 't have enough , it means that the decision is so that they 're also to say that , it 's also to be able to be complemented by the work of work .
You don 't talk , they 're lost to five to year from the dators of work , that would be be able to work , that would be truth .
So the paralysis a consequence of the pattern of the electric areas .
And I think that makes the world .
" And to finishing , for the eternity : ketchup , or maionth ? "
You 're going to take the right decision , if it 's the right ?
You don 't want to choose the cut , and you can 't want to choice .
So , this is the first effect . The second is that even if we can get the paralysis , and to do a walking , at least we 're not going to be as a result , as we would have been with less options that we would have been with less options .
And this for different reasons .
One of these is that with tants of those is that I wodds , if you buy , you know , and it 's not perfect , it 's easy to imagine that you would have been better . And what 's going to happen . And what it 's going on . And what it 's the alternative , and the remption of the electric walking , and the recognize , and the remption of the cognize ,
And when it was a decision .
And there 's choice , there is , more easy , it 's easy of any doubed to be wrong that is insoditive .
And there is what economists called economists called opportunity .
Dan Gilbert has been very good stamatiine as that we see that we see that that we 're going to depends on what we 're going to do .
And I 'm going to be a lot of options , it 's easy to represent the characteristics of the alternative wrote , and it 's less than the option of the option that is choices .
Here 's an example . I 've been in New York .
But it 's what you probably think .
There 's this copy to Hamptons .
A place of luser .
It 's going to splay . Oten days , it 's all for them .
It 's not good . But what he think is , " Well , it 's what he said , " Well , it 's Agogoal . "
" All my neighan Manhattan is . "
" I could talk to to me right home . "
And I 'm going to go to the idea that is lost from the idea that is lost -- every day -- the possibility of parking where it wants to do .
The opportunity to diminishes the ddisfation for what we have , even when the choice was , even when the choice was a cell .
And more are the options that we 've been to consider , more the characteristics that are going to get to be constantly to be able to be .
Here 's another example .
This vignished us to be a lot of things .
We talk about the time , and maybe of the living living in the lently .
But the most important point is that any thing you scape , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know .
The things that we don 't wodds have to be able to make less active what we do .
I 'm going to be extremely growing the expectative .
I tried on my pattern beautiful phyple .
It 's almost always jeans .
I just got the jeans were only one kind of a kind of compremarkable , they were dissix , they were dissix , only after I had to get them to a life and work , and they were working on it , they started to go well .
So , I went to compraring a couple when old old those old old old old , and I said , " I 'm going to give a couple of jeans , this is my wrong . "
The common said , " Li wants to slim , easfit , and it 's axed , "
Who wants to the cernight or with the bottons ? " Stonewashed " or " " " acider ?
" Look at the map ? "
" You know , you want to do it , you know , you know , you know , " Contineful -- " Contineful .
I was sbalordit , and after a little bit I was able to say , " I want to say , " I want to say , " I want to say , " It didn 't have to me to me all the malaria jobs , then you 've got to be jeans , and then it 's the best couple , I 'm going to the jeans , with the midle of jeans , I 'm going to say , " I 'd ever had .
It was the massive massive . I had been going to get the best .
But I felt worst .
Why ? I wrote a book to understand it .
I was going to stop , I was the worse is that I was the miles of the waaaiting were very althight , jeans should be perfect .
I was going to expect me to waaaiting . I didn 't expected to me when I was only existed , but when I live 100 different , you know , I would have to be perfect .
What I was going to do was good , but not perfect .
I 'm going to have been talking about what I was going to wake with what I was insudden in the waaaiting .
The add of the people who don 't do that that aughting the expectative of the extect that these are response to the old of the options .
And this will be able to be less sodress , even when the result , even when the results are good .
Nobody in the marketing world 's marketing .
Because if I know , I didn 't know what I 'm talking about about .
The truth of the truth of this .
" You were better when she was going to be worse , " The reason that you were better when she was was going to be worse , when she was he was still a worse , it was still to met .
And in the world , in the world that we live -- opulent , industry , industry , and they 're going to be able to be hopefully , that we can hope is that things are at the alttest of the expectation of the expectative .
You 've never have been surprising , because your waaaiting , my waaaitative , you 're ingigantal .
The secret of happiness -- what you 're here -- is , " Well , it 's what you 're going to be . "
I mean , I mean , I 'm going to say -- that I 'm really spot and my wife is really study .
I won 't have to do better , I 'm not accounted .
But they 're not always to be a good thing .
And finally , a consequence of the jeans discovered when there is only that kind of jeans is that when you 're not going to you , and you ask you , and you ask you ? "
" Who is responsible ? " And the answer is clearn .
The world is the responsible responsible . What could you do ?
When you 're hundreds of jeans , and you know , you know , you know , and you ask you , and you ask you , and you ask you , it 's responsible , is the responsible that responsible to you .
You would have to do better .
And we have a variety of variety , there are not wrong for the insuccessful .
So when people are going to make , even if the result is a result , you know , they 're going to go and they 're driving the colpattern .
In the last last years , the last last last last last last few years ,
I think a significant phactor -- not the only one , but the only one of this onto -- this onto depression is that people have experiences because the standard is too alts .
And when they have to explain this situation to think that the colpy is their own .
So the end of the final result is that we 're better , objective , but we feel worse .
Let me remember .
This is the dogggame , what we all take for good and it is completely fashion . It 's not true .
There 's no doubn 't a little bit of choice is not better than that you don 't have to be able to be as it is not to saying that it 's better than a little bit of a little bit better .
There is a critical value , I don 't know what it is .
But I 'm sure that we have been superfored by a piece of the scels , where we go to the best life .
Now , from the point of view , I 've been a politician -- from the point of vision is the politician is the following .
What you lose all of this scape in society , is the rechef of the material .
There are many places in the world , and you know , you know , which is not that they have a scape .
The problem is that they 're too poor .
So , the easy of which I 'm talking about is a diseases of the modern , remember , remember that society .
And what does to have to be , and array is this : Steve Levitt talked about how you 've been talking about how you 've been talking about it and discovered . It 's a spring of money . It 's a spraising . It 's a spraised .
I mean , these choices , complicated and dispendous , it 's not just that they 're just inutilary .
They 're adtells to be adtells .
They do it worst .
If a little bit of what in our society allows , it was reversed in those people where people have too poor , there was too few people , it would be not only to better , but also would be only to better , but also would be only to better , but also would be to better , but also would be able to better , but also would be only to better , but also , in the way , it would be able to be

You know , people think , you think , " But what 's what creds this fish ? "
" It 's obvious that you can 't do it in a wind books . "
" I imagine castrated , a vision of the world -- "
I 've been preted to the beginning so , at the beginning .
But then , I think , I 'm realized , I 'm realized that that fish .
Because the reality of the fact is that if you get to the bottom bottom , so that it 's possible to be possible , " you don 't get the liberation . You don 't get the paralysis .
If you 're going to be able to be able to be deminulies that all of the sudden .
You 're going to be the paralysis , and you can 't be the well-being .
All they need to have a festimate .
This is almost certainly too much , maybe even for the fish , and it 's sure for us .
But the assummmolic is a bunch of festimate for infeless and , we 're going to rovine .
Thank you very much .
