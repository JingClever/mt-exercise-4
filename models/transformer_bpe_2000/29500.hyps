I 've showed this last year I showed this slide to demonstrate that glacial glacial , which for almost three million years has been the size of the U.S. continental , it 's refed over 40 percent .
But this subjects this subjects the gravity of the problem because it doesn 't show the ice of the ice of the ice .
The artics glacial calots is , in a way , the heart of global climate system .
You can get invers and you get summer .
The next slide is going to be a fast carlate on the last 25 years .
The ice lost lost gets are signed in red .
As you see , they 're going to the blue .
That 's the ice in winter , which you reach summer .
You can see the cosidgn ice , lost , of five years or more , is like the blood , and that 's like the blood , that the blood , and the blood , and that 's like the blood ,
In 25 years , it 's spent from this ,
This is a problem because the whole thing is the interest in the ocean ice , the glacier around the ocean where there are enormous amount of coal congeled that , slightly , they 're transformed into microbes .
I reach to the totality of the totality of global warming , that amount of global warming , that amount of global warming , that amount of global inside .
In some laghi labor is the deep in Alaska , the metane is bolding water .
The professoresse Katey Walter of Alaska , I rected with a team , and I took a team in , and the winter .
Video : Wow ! Al Gore : Wow ! You 're good .
A reason is that this third is that this termal exchange from the North .
This is a glacial river .
The downnnever reached levels .
This is the Kangerlussuaq in the west Souast Greenland .
If you want to know how the sea level of the sea level of the sea , and the mate sea , here is where it reaching the sea .
These corrups are increasing rapidly .
As the other side of the planet : Antarctarttica of the planet .
The month of the scientists have clear that the balance of the ice is in negative , and the Antarctarctica , which is a western in some islands , is particularly fly in the slandscape .
Exial at six meters of the acque , as Greenland .
Himalayas the Himalayas largest ice block , you see new laghi , which few years ago were glacier .
Forth percent of the world population will be population as the water population .
Sull Ande : this glacier is the source of the powerful water source .
The downnnership .
But when it diminishes , the same happens to the water .
In California the snow on the Sierra Nevada is 40 percent .
The griors are in crisis .
The predictions , as you read , are graves .
The growth secure growing in the world 's powerful car .
The environmental disasters are increasing a rhythm out of the normal and without precedental .
Four times more number of times in the last 30 years than previous 75 .
This is a whole thing that 's an unsustainable .
If you look at it in the historical consequences .
In the last five years we added 70 million tons of CO2 every 225 million tons of tons in the ocean every day .
Look at the Eastonist Pacific , from the Americas , from the Americas , and the west , and the west parts of the subcontinent , where there is a radical poor of the oxygen in the ocean .
The major because of global warming , together to deforestation , which is 20 percent of the fuels , is the use of fossils .
The oil is a problem , and the coal is even worse .
The United States are one of the two countries with China .
And he was proposed to build a lot of coal .
But we 're seeing at a changing of direction .
These are annoulbly annoulbly projects in the last few years and some of alternative projects .
Everything is , there 's a politics in our country .
The coal of coal and oil , have spent 250 million dollars in the last year for promote coal , which is a bone .
And this image of this image --
I 'm Natal , in the Tennessee , where I live , there was a 3.8 billion lighter .
Maybe you saw it on the news .
This is the biggest second flow of scories in America .
It happened around the Natal .
The natalization of one of the coal industries was this .
Video : Without the carbon is a piece of allegry and happy .
It 's abundant here in America , and it 's growing our economy .
Frosty the carbon is more and more more .
It 's a good price , and workable workers are keep .
Al Gore : Al Gore 's here is a lot of the West Virginia .
The biggest minerary society is Massey Coal . This is his mountains .
Video : Don Blankenship : I 'll be clear -- Al Gore , Nancy Pelosi , Nancy Pelosi , they don 't know what they 're talking about .
Al Gore : So the Aleance for the Clima Proteition , and I launched two campaign .
This is one of them , one part .
Video : Acctually : ALergy see the climate change as a threat our business .
So , our priority is to invest a great amount of money in a publicitary public to make public and confused the truth of coal .
In fact , coal is not sports .
We think it 's a good slide -- it 's also a good smoke .
So not preocupateves of climate change .
Let me do you .
Video : Accclean : Carbone , you heard a lot of it .
So , you know , you know , a turn in a structure that 's about the coal , as it is clean .
Straordinary ! The machines are a little noise , but this is the sound of the technology of clean technology .
The coal consumption is between the main global warming , but the night of the global warming technology , you see it changes everything .
You have a look : this is the coal technology of clean clean .
Al Gore : Al Gore , the alternative connects to economic security and to that the national security .
Video : Comvice is in America is in crisis ; the national security , the national security .
The flows that the lines all of our dependence on the fossils , like coal and oil , the coal and oil .
Now , there 's a new , audence , you know , you know ,
Repower America : 100 percent clean energy in 10 years .
A to reput the world to work , make us more sure , and help us stop global warming .
Finally , a solution that burning our problems .
Repower America . Scover more .
Al Gore : This is the last .
Video : Comvice : It 's about refun energy to America .
One of the fastest ways to bring the end of the combustic combustible that killed our planet .
What 's the future is here . Vent , soles , a new energy , you know , a new energy .
What it 's two : Noves the investment for the workers of work for retribute .
Commess : Repower America . It 's time to be realistic .
Al Gore : Al Gore 's an old African proverbio says , " If you want to go fast , you go down to the money .
If you want to go away , you go away . "
We need to go away , quickly .
Thank you very much .
Last year at TED , I did an introduction on the LHC .
And I promise to traveling to advocate you about how the machine works .
So here I am . And for the other time , there were no , the LHC is the biggest scientific experiment ever -- 27 kilometers of circumference .
His task is to remember the conditions that were less than a billion in the beginning of the universe -- 600 million times a second .
All that 's just environment is simply environment .
This is the Ginevra under Ginevra .
We 're taking these mini-Big Big Bang in the relatives .
This is what I work . It 's called ATLAS -- it 's a 44 feet and has a 222 meters .
This is an image of ATLATLAS in building so you can notice the proportions .
Ten September Time , we have accese the machine for the first time .
And this picture was taken by ATLAS .
It was that it was huge to control in the room .
It 's a picture of the first of the first of particles that had done all the around of the LHC , entering in collision , with one part of the LHC , and spread particles within the rise .
In other words , when we saw that image 10 , the 10 September , we figure the machine worked , which is a great victory .
I don 't know if that was this to make us more or more , and I 'm going to do this , when somebody went to Google and saw that the beginning was this .
That means we had a cultural impact beyond that scientific .
About a week later , there was a problem with the machine , because of these damed sleeping here -- these sleep sleep .
These files bring 13,000 prints when the machine works at the massive works of power .
Now , the technicians between you look at the kids and say , " It 's not true pleasure . They 're too throw . "
And instead they can do that when they 're very cold slowed with slowers .
So , at less 271 degrees , at a standing inferior at the star of the space between the stars , these float that corn .
In one of the snap between the MRHC magnetic , there was a fabrication of fabrication .
So the float of scale , and the 13,000 prints , and the 13,000 practice suddenly met a electrical resistance .
This was the result .
Now , this is even more impressive if you think these magnets more than 20 tons , and that have been about 30 centimeters , and that have been about 30 centimeters .
They 're sitting about 50 magnets .
We had to take them , what we did .
We repristined and adverted them .
Now , they 're going back to their place .
By the end of the MHC is is new integry .
We 're going to accenaging , and we expect the data to judgly , and we continue our adventure to discover what the morning is the universe .
Now , of course , in a way , these crashing the dibate on the value of science and engineering in frontier . It 's easy to confuture .
I think the fact that it 's so hard , the fact of going to go beyond the limitations of things like the LHC .
I want to conclude with the words of an Ingan scientist , Humphrey Davy , which , imagine , in the defense of the experiments of his pupppin , his pupppleasure of the human mind , and he said , " Nichael Faraday , he said , " Nothing to the ideas of the definitive is , that we don 't have any worldwide , and the worldwide , and the worldwide of the world 's new world-world-worldwide , and that we are not in the world , and the ideas of concerned .
Thank you .
I want to start to ask you to rethink about when children , you 're playing , you 're going to ask the morning .
As you understand how to reach them and sleep them , and you get them , and move them , learning , learned to think about and solving problems that they 're going to think about problems and manipulating relationships .
The space reasoning is deeply connected to the way we understand most of the world around us .
So , as the information is a useful information with our physical objects , with my physical objects , and my collaborator Jeevevan Kalanithi , I started to ask me , " And if we use a computer , instead of having the only curs-like crawling , and we can stick fight a wird of the digital pastry that moves on a dest , and I could stand to the both of the information with the hands of the hands ,
and we have to fix our feeling ?
The question was so interesting that we decided to explore the answer , building the answer , building the Siftable .
In a words , a Siftable , a Siftable computer interactive .
In a words , a Siftable , a Siftable computer interactive .
You can move them with the hand , they can see , you can see the movement and have a radio and a radio radio radio .
But most physical objects , are physical objects , you can just move simply to dive .
The Siftable is a new ecosystem of tools to manipulate the digital information .
And as they get more physical consciously , consciously , as well , as it is as physical , conscious , of the other , of how we move them , we can explore new and different styles of interaction .
I 'll start with some simple example .
This Siftable is configurated to show the video : if you include it in a direction , the video run like this , if you including back back .
These interactive rats are aware of the other .
If you go to , you care about what they 're going to them around .
If they 're surrounded , and they can act a little bit .
If they 're surrounded , and they can act a little bit .
They have their movement and inclination .
We then realized that one of the interesting implications of the interaction was the power of the data , to put the common data , to put a color like a liquid .
In this case , we have three Siftable as a source of source and I can use them to the color in that central , where they mix them .
and I can use them to put them in color in that central , where they mix .
If we 're too much , we can put a little bit of it .
You also have a beautiful chance of apprentice , like languages , the mathematics and logic logical things where people can try to do the things fast , and you see the results of it , and you see the immediately results ,
Now I 'm now --
This is a sequence of Fibonacks that I do with a program of equations .
Here we have a game of words that is half between Scarabean and Boggle .
Pratically , at every turn to a letter in the case of every Siftable , Pratically , at every turn a letter in case , and while you 're trying to understand words to control words , and while certainly certain words about the display .
Then , after about 30 seconds , you have a new set of letters and new sletter possibility to try .
Thank you .
Here 's the kids came to the Media Lab , I did so they would try and put them and they would tried them and I turned a video .
They 're very much pile-pile-pleased .
And one of the interesting things about this kind of application is that you don 't have to give people a lot of education .
You just say , " Compones of the words , and they know exactly what to do .
Here 's a other people that try it .
This is our younger test test , right there .
It was actually just wanted to impilate them .
They were only morning , for him .
Now , this is an interactive application of a cardboard interactive .
We wanted to build a tool for the apprentice of the languages is Felix .
It can insert new characters in the scene , solving Siftall their associated .
It can insert new characters in the scene , solving Siftall their associated .
So , it 's doing the sun .
Video : The Sun is source .
David Merrill : Now he brought a treator in the scene .
Video : The arange treator .
By ! Yeah ! Yes !
So I reverse Siftable and put it close neighborhood can interact the characters --
Video : Bau !
and by inventing your story .
Video : Ciao !
DM : It 's a story with the wind , and it can decide him how it fly .
DM : It 's a story with the wind , and it can decide him how it fly .
Video : Volvia , right ,
DM : The last example I have time to show you is a tool , recently recently , to walk and execececuliar music .
It 's a recently , recently , to wild and execececk music .
The Siftable , Siften , based and the bacteria .
Every one of these has four different variations , and you can choose what to use .
You can also be insert of the sounds in a sequence to compare to your feeling .
And it just just to make it touch a sound and a sequence .
These are effects that you can control from the vive , and the filter and filter .
I 'm going to a particular sound , and then including it .
And then there are the general as time and fly , and fly , that we applicate to the whole sequence .
Let 's look at how it works .
Video : DM : DM : We 'll start putting a base in two Siftable , we 're going to get it into a series , we add it , we add other base .
Now I put a line of based line .
Video : DM : Now I add some percussion --
Video : And I 'll put the filter the battery , so I can control the effect from the vive vive .
Video : DM : DM : I can fly the whole sequence by a time or from one side or the other .
Video : And I 'll add the filter to the low low low low to the filter to the flower to expression .
Video : DM : DM : I can recombining the sequence .
So I don 't have to plan it first , but I can improvising it , to make it longer or more corta .
And now , finally , I can spumbing the whole sequence inclining to the Siftable to the Siftable .
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is building new interface , new murder , and more like the machine , and more like the body is worth our brain and body .
And today , I had time to show you one of the results of this lost , and also some chance that we 're trying to bring out from the lab .
The concept I want to transmit is that it 's coming up this new generation of projects for interact with digital media , which will bring information in our world in the way we want .
Thank you very much .
I don 't see the hour of talk to all of you .
I 'm a writer .
Seek books is my profession , but it 's more than that , of course .
It 's also love and the love of my life .
And I don 't expect that changes .
But , I said , something particular happened in my life and my life , and my career , who brought me to realibrate the entire relationship with this work .
The particular thing is that I recently wrote this book , this biography called Manogy , " Manogy , " Ama , " which , diversity , for some reason that , for some reason that world and become a big , sensatisfic , whatever he came to be a big , sensatisfaces .
And the result is that everywhere go , people treating me as if I was convicted .
Davily -- condannect , condamn !
They are going to me now everybody worried and say , " Don 't be able to be able to do better ?
Don 't you fear to continue to write all life without power to create a book that can be able to make a book that can be important anybody ? "
What can important to somebody ? "
It 's rassure , you know .
But it could go worse , I remember than 20 years ago , when I started to say to people -- I was a adolescent adolescent -- I was a writer .
I would go to the same reaction based by fear .
And people say , " Don 't the temes that I couldn 't be able ?
Don 't you fear that the umiliation of killed you ?
Don 't you fear to do this for all life without that nothing is that you have ever come out and die on a cumulate sodings with the both of fallised with the footage of fallisance ,
So , you know .
The answer -- the short answer to all these questions is , " Yeah . "
Yes , I 'm afraid of all those things .
I 've always had fear .
And I also fear of many other things that people can 't have to indicate .
As the algae and other things .
But , as I think about that , and I thought , and I was a last mentioned , is why ?
Is it rational ?
It 's a logical that anyone has to expected from a work that you 've been born for a work that you 've been born to do .
But what 's there that particular in the creative creative to make us nervous about health health health health mental health in a way that other career do not ?
As my father , for example , he was a chemical engineer and I don 't remember one time in his 40 years of activity where he asked to be engineer ?
Are there -- that block of the John , how do you go ?
Don 't work like that , you know ?
Onestically , chemical engineers like group , they don 't certainly , in the chemistry , the reputation of being handle handle .
We have enough writers , we have enough enough this reputation , and not only creative writers , we have this reputation of being huge mentally stable mentally .
And I 'm not going to look at the sad sad sad , the magnificent minds that only in the 2th century , they died young and often for them .
And the ones that are not suicipators are not suicipate from their dons .
Norman Mailer , before I died , in the last interview said , " I kill my book has killed me a little bit more . " A remarkable . " The labor remarkable .
But we don 't buy cily when we feel that because we heard these things that in some way we 've completely interized and accepted the notion that creativity and the notion is that creativity and the art , at the end , it will be able to huge .
And the question I want to bring all of this idea is , you 're agreed with this idea ?
It 's good at this thing -- because he also looked at a himeter display , not good for anything this suppose .
I think it 's hath .
And I think it 's also dangerous and I don 't want to see perpetuated in the next century .
I think it 's better encourage our great creative minds to live .
And I know that , in my case -- in my case -- it would be very dangerous to start to fire out at that feeling , absolutely date the surround , the circumstances in my career .
That is , in fact , I 'm like , I 'm like , I 'm like , 40 years old .
I have about four decades of work in me .
And it 's very likely that whatever I 'm writing in the world 's going to be juddged by the world as the work that was going to my last book .
I 'm going to be square , because we 're all likely that my biggest success is my biggest success is my biggest success is .
Oh , Gesus , who think .
You know this is the kind of thought that leads a person to start to get a person in the morning , and I don 't want to do that .
I would stop continue to continue to do this work that I love .
So , the question is , how ?
And so it seems to me , after many reflections , that the way to work to continue to write is to create a psychological courious pertial costruct , OK ?
I have to find a security between me , which I 'm writing , and my natural , and my natural anxiety about which is going to be able to get the reaction of the things that you started to look through the time , and I was looking through the time , trying to find other societies to see if they could have the best ideas and healthier .
about how to help creative people to manage the inerent inherent people of creativity .
And that research took me to the ancient Great and ancient Rome .
Seguitem because it gets back to circle and then back .
In the ancient Great and ancient Rome -- people didn 't seem to believe that creativity was sitting that creativity was from men , OK ?
It was thought that creativity was this spirit about it , and it came to men from a few source , and unknown , for reasons , for reasons and unknown .
The greeek called these spirits of creativity , " demons " demons . "
Socrate , wonderful , he creded to have a demon that wisdom from sages .
The Romanes were the same idea , but they called that spirit that kind of spirit a genius .
And that 's great , because the Romanners didn 't really think that a genius was a little smart intelligent .
They have a genius was this kind of entity that created an entity lived in the walls of a crazy , a little bit like the Dobby , and the elfo Dobby , and that came out to treat the work of the artist and model the outside of that work .
It 's the distance of -- here 's the distance of which I talk about -- that psychological costrutt that you protect from the results of your work .
And everybody knew that was that worked , right ?
So the anticies were protected by certain things , as for example , as the too narcicisixm , not ?
If your work was exceptional not evil you could get all the merital , everybody knew that they had been helped by this genius .
If your failure , it wasn 't all your own , right ?
Everybody knew that was your genius to be a incapable .
And so people han concept the creativity in the West for a long time .
Then the Rinascivvvent came , and it changed this big idea ; we put the human being in the center of the universe of the universe , and the misters and more leaving space to the mitive space to the mitive creatures that writing from divinity .
This was the Ready of humans and people started to think that creativity was completely from ishared idividulate .
And for the first time in history , you begin to referred to this or that artist as a genius as a genius as a genius with a genius .
And I have to tell you , I think it was a big mistake mistake .
I think that allow somebody to believe , a simple person to believe that you can be like a recipient as the source , the essence and the source of all the divins , creative , inosconcible , and ethernal is a responsibility to the fragile humans .
It 's like to somebody to inguiate the sun .
Dego and shares completely the ego and creates all these inextremendous waitable on performance .
And I think it was this pressure to have been the artists in the past 500 years .
And if that is true , and I think that is , the question is , and now ?
Can we do it different ?
Maybe back to a more ancient understanding of the relationship between humans and mistery .
Or maybe not .
Maybe we can 't sell 500 years of rational thinking in a 18 minutes .
And there is probably people in the audience that would be reading to be able to be able to scientific notion , insometimes that follow people to do the things , or they do the projects .
Probably not convince you all about this thing .
But the question I would like to bring is -- why not ?
Why not think that way ?
Because it 's more sense than anything else ever ever heard to explain the exasperformance of the process of creative process .
A process that , as anyone who ever ever ever tried to do something -- so , basically , everybody here -- it doesn 't understand rationally .
And in fact , it can sometimes completely paranormal .
And I did this meeting with the extraordinary poetesse Ruth Stone , who has now 90 years , but a poetesse for the whole life and told me that he was a poetesh for the lives , and he was a poetabove , working out in the camps , and he was in the wind , and the fear , when a poem was from the landscape .
He told me that was like a fragorous train .
And that was rotates by the landscape .
He felt it comes to , because he was a tremendous to the land under his feet .
He knew you have one thing to do about that point and it was , words like a map . "
And so it goes back to this poetry , and he wouldn 't have to make it a piece of paper and a match enough card and a match enough card , while the trapp , and he would not get it to the page .
Sometimes you couldn 't be fast , so it goes and run without able to get back and the poet rotles and the poetry the rotles through and she would go down through the landscape , and he would continue to rotolar through the landscape , and he would continue to cheating through the landscape , and he would continue to go into the home , and he would go into the home and go down through the landscape , and they would keep it up through the landscape , and go into the landscape
Then there were times -- this piece of time -- this piece , I 'll never forget it -- there were moments that was almost losing , OK ?
So , he was running back home and he was trying to look at the poem and the poem was a match in the way , and then he said , he was like , and then he said , that was like , if you sleep with the other hand and the waste .
He was the poem from the tail and reput it in his body and transply-page .
And in these cases , the poem would be presented on the perfect page and intact , but the last word to the first word .
So when I thought about it -- it 's crazy , it 's exactly equal to my process .
Not all my creative process -- I 'm not a condition .
I 'm a mulo , and my way to work is ; you wake up to the same oraries every day and saying , and work and go over and go over and go over the goodly .
But even I , in my head , I 've striped against that thing , sometimes .
And I imagine that many of you did .
You know , even if the work and ideas came to me from a certain source , I could not be honestly , I could not be honestly saw .
And what is that ?
And how can we relationate to us to make the head , but , rather , rather , that does it make us remain healthy ?
As I realized , the best example of Tom Wait , which I have been the Tom Waits , which I interviewed a different day .
We were talking about this , and you know , Tom , for most of life has been the incarnation of the artist went back to contemporary , trying to control , to control , to manage , dominate these kind of crowds , totally interized interized .
But then I invest , he got up , and one day as he was driving on a autostrada in Los Angeles , changed everything for him .
He was going to go fast and all of a sent tract this little piece of melody , which is in his head as it does the inspiration , and settle , and the wants , you know , it 's wonderful , and it wants , you know , but not as to take it .
It 's not a piece of paper , not have a mathemath , not has a registrer .
So he starts to feel this sort of old anxiety growing in him , " I 'm going to lose , and I 'll be obsessed by this song lost song .
I 'm not good enough and I can 't do it . "
And instead of going to go to the panic , they stop .
I 'm going to make the entire process , and he did something completely new .
And he just look at the sky and he said , " Scuses , you can 't see that I 'm driving ? "
" As you can write a song ?
If you really want to exists , back to a more opporting time when I can take care of you .
Atherwise , you go to important anything else today .
You go to disturban Leonard Cohen . "
And his process worked changed after this .
Don 't work , the work was still dark like it .
But the process , and the fish that was required when the genius was required when the genius , the genius that was going to be able to go back to where the problems and liberated it back to where it , and he was doing it , and make it .
but well , I 'm going to get this burst , wonderful bizarre collaboration between Tom and this strange thing , and this strange , and this strange thing that 's not Tom .
So , as the story is , I started changing a little bit the way I worked , and I was saved up .
This idea , I was saved when I was writing " Manogy , Ama , " and cadds in one of those caves of the dispersation where we all cause when we 're working on something and we can 't start to think that 's going to be a disaster , which is going to be the worst written .
Not only bad , just the worse book .
And I started to think about gap this project .
But then I remember about Tom that was talking about the air and I tried to us .
So you zoom in in the room and I realized my comments to a vacuum vacuum of the room .
And I said to high voices , " Solds , what we know if this not will be brilliant not going to be bright , not it 's going to be hearing my , right ?
Because as you see I 'm putting all I have , I don 't have more than that .
So if you want to be better , you have to present , and make your part .
OK . But if you don 't do it , you know what , I don 't do .
I 'll just writing the same because it 's my work .
And I would like to make my part of the world today , I 've been presented to do my part , " Because the end is that , OK -- the finally , OK -- it 's like the North people recorded for the charch of the clay of the clear of the kark of the crowd of the sacred hours of hours and the hours .
And they always were magnific , because the balerins were professionals and they were fantastic .
But every once , something happened happened , and one of these artists became actually .
And I know you know what I 'm talking about , because I know you have seen it , at a certain , performance like that .
It was like the time stopped , and the balert swalked through a kind of bring , and not doing anything else from the usually , but it 's all sorts of it , but everything swalked up .
And suddenly , not appeared as a human .
But you accurated from the divinity and under the fire of divinity .
And when this happened , at the time , the people knew what was called it with his name .
They congls and started cantar , and they started cantar , " Allah , God , God , God , God . "
That 's God , you know .
Curious known -- when the Ms invading the south of Spain , I got this habitude with them and the pronounds of " Allah , Allah , Allah , Allah , " the running , Allah , the slope , " which you can be hear in the round or the floor in the floor the flamp .
In Spain , when an artist has done something that is impossible and magic , " Allah , the word , " Allah , magnificent , " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " God .
And it 's great because we need it .
But the problem is the day after the ballery , when you wake up and discover that they are the 11 of the morning of Martedyes and the God of the morning of God , there 's no longer .
It 's just a mortal with mortal ginept , and maybe it 's not going to be able to get that alteeth .
And maybe anybody will be the name of God even while , what 's has to do with his life ?
It 's hard .
This is one of the most painhercilizes to make in a creative life .
But maybe it has to be so ancient that 's so ancient if you can 't believe , the most extraordinary aspects of your being being from you are from yourself .
But you just believe that they 're very prestied by a unimaginable source of this squisity part of your life that you have to somebody else when you finished .
And , you know , if we think that 's all changing .
And so I started to think about it , and it 's certainly like this , I thought for several months in the book that I can publishing soon , the dangerous , I 'm going to follow , I would be followed to follow my grander .
And what I have to continue to tell me when I feel elected from this is , not having .
Don 't raise . It 's only your work .
Continuary involved to the part , any way , whatever it can be .
If your work is balance , balance .
If the divine , lisurd genius to leave a few kind of wonderful , for one moment , only for a moment through your efforts , then , " On ! "
Atriments , you do the same your dance .
And " Ole ! " I 'm going to you .
I think , and I think , you have to teach it .
" On ! " at you , the same , even for the human love and heading tals and tweardaggin to give you continually present .
Thank you .
Thank you .
June Cohen : Ole !
As you know , I 've talked about some of these projects on the human genome , what is meaning and new genes of genes .
Now we 're starting a new percourse : we started to digitalize biology and now we 're going to go into a new phase of biology , we 're entering in a new biology , design and synthetizing life .
We 've always been trying to bring big questions .
" What is life ? " is something that many biologists , I think they have loved a vary labs .
We 've been different approaching it , reduced to the minimes .
We 're digitalizing almost 20 years .
When we sequenced the human genome was going to spend from the analogical world of the biology in the digital world of computers .
Now we ask us : we can regenerate life , or create new life from this digital universe ?
This is the map of a little organism , the Mycoplasma genitalium , which is the smallest genome that can autoreel in the lab .
And we tried to reduce the genome to create one more smaller .
We 're able to eliminate a hundred genes of the kind of about 500-to-500 genes that are here .
But when we look at his map map is simple relatively simple respond to our map .
Look at me , this is simple .
But when we look at all the genes that we can eliminate , one at the time , it 's very unlikely that this can bring a living cells .
So we decided that the only way to provide that the only way to provide this cromosome of the things that they can get modify the components to bring some of these fundamental questions .
And so we started the " adventure of " Can we synthesize a cromosome ? "
Can the chemical conscious consciously we never have been able to produce these big molecules that we never have been able to create before ?
And , in case , we can we make a cromosome of a cromosome ?
A cromosome is simply a chemical material .
The speed with which we are able to digitalize life is growing to exponential exponential .
Our ability to write the genetic code , instead of , rather slowly , but it 's improving .
And our most recent results that they bring it on a exponential curve .
We started more than 15 years ago .
The process is required a lot of pasages , beginning with a biothic review before we started .
But we found that DNA synthizing is very hard .
There are tens of thousands of machines in DNA , the longness of 30 to 50 length of a 50 longer , and it 's a process : more the segment is more than the segment is , more the segment , the more errors .
So we had to develop a new method to assembly these fragments and correct the mistakes .
And this was our first attempt , and this is the digital information of the genome of Phi X 174 .
It 's a little virus that kills kills .
We 've been designed the frments , effected the correction of errors and get a molecule of DNA about 555,000 letter letter .
The interesting part is when we took this piece of chemical material , and we put it into the bacteria , and we put it into the bacteria , the bacteria have started reading this genetic code and producing the viral particles .
The viral particles have been required by the cells , are back and distrutt the E. coli .
I 've talked about recently with membrances of oil industry , which they have certainly compress that they have certainly compress .
They have more than you .
We believe that this is a situation where the software can actually build his hardware in a biological system .
But we wanted to do things more in big big .
We wanted to build the entire cromosome of the bacteria .
They 're more than 580 miles letters of genetic code .
So we thought about building it in seven in the size of the virus , so that we can change the cassettes for the seven of the cell of the living cells .
The design is crucial , and if we start with digital information in a computer , these have to be very accurate .
When we sequency this genome for the first time in 1995 accurately , it was a mile for every 10 miles .
We found , resequenzens , 30 herrors . If we had used that sequence original sequence we never would be able to work .
One part of the process is to design segments that are about 50 letters that are all over 50 letters of the 50 letters to build smaller undercity smaller working together .
We try to be unique elements here .
Probably you have read that we put us on the fire .
Think about four lets , we have a genetic code on four letters : A , C , G and To .
Three of those letters together code about 20 lots , and there 's a specific order to the letter every time to every amminoacide .
So we can use the genetic code to write words , framework , frames .
What we did the beginning was autography .
Some of them have been in the fact that it wasn 't poetry .
We 've been designed these segments to just unenzyme to just unenzyme .
There are enzymes that repair them and put them together .
And we started assembling to assembling the parts , by five to seven segments from five to seven readers , unending a segments of 24 miles reading reading segments to get 72 miles letters .
We have made these sequency in abundance , so that we 're trying to make it a very crazy robstood -- you 'll see in a minute .
We 're trying to automatize the process .
So , this seems like the tabellon a basket .
When we get to these very long segments very long , more than 100 miles , they 're not going to grow directly in the E. coli .
You get to the limit of the modern biology .
So we 've been considered to other mechanisms .
We knew about another mechanism called recombination , which in biology that biology is using biology to repair the DNA can une the DNA can une segments .
Here 's an example .
This organism , called Deinococcus radiation , it can absorbing three million radiation .
You can see in the super-high require as his chromosome is distrutt .
In 12 -- 24 hours is reassembled exactly like it was before .
There are thousands of organisms that are able to do that .
These organisms , you can be completely .
They can live under vacuum .
They 're absolutely certainly that life exists in space , and you will spoke to find new environments of water .
The true , NASA showed that this happens .
This is a picture of the molecule we built using these processes , simply using the least design with the segments of the segments that we 're insert .
The evidence is the clear .
This image was not taken with a microscope with a microscope , but with a microscope .
It 's a very big molecule that we can see it with a microscope .
These are pictures that cover a period of about six seconds .
This is the publication we did a little time ago .
They 're more than 580,000 letters of genetic code .
It 's the biggest molecule that we 've ever made from man .
It 's got a molecular weight to 300 million .
If we were going to get it with a 10 , without spaces , you would like 142 pages , it would just take this genetic code .
Now , how do we work ? How can we activity it ?
Of course , you love a virus is a kids .
It 's a little more complicated when you use the bacteria .
It 's easier even when it 's bigger than our eucariote , you can just extract the nucleus and put another , which is basically the clonation process .
In the bacteria , the cromosome is integrated instead of integrated within the cell , but we have recently demonstrated that we 're able to make a transplant transplant cell from one and activity .
We could refloor a cromosome parting species .
The two are different than men from the men .
We 've added some gene that we could decide what choose to choose for this cromosome .
And then he slaughter with the ends in a way to kill all the proteins .
And when we put it in the cells was amazing -- and you 'll appreciate our sophisticatoes -- the new cromosome of the cromosome has been in the cells .
And we thought we couldn 't go beyond , but we 've tried to spinhering us in there .
This is one of the major mechanisms of evolution .
We found that many species have added that a second or a third , a second or a third , added in a thousands of new tracts to that species .
So who think about evolution is just a gene at the time that it has not understood most of biology .
There are a enciententists called " restription that they 're digestion the DNA .
The cromosome that was in the cells not have one .
The cell phone that we put it .
And it 's expressed , and he recognize the other chromosome , like material , and we got it with only the cromosome , and we just rran the new cromosome and the new cromosome cccccccromosome .
It became blue because of the genes we put it .
And in a short lass of time , all the cars of a species , and you have been going to be , and it turned into a new species , based on the new software that we put in the cells .
All proteins are changed , and when we read the genetic code , and when we read the genetic code exactly what we 've been transferred to what we 've been transferred to what we 've been transferred to what we 've been transferred to what we 've been transferred to what we 've been transferred you .
Now , this may seem alchemy genetics , but we 're going to hate the software DNA , we can change things in the things in a enough substancial .
Now , I 've been explained that you don 't talk about genesis -- but we 've been progress to the three million years and a half of evolution , and I said that maybe we 're going to create a new version of the Cambrian explosion of Cambrian explosion .
Why do that ?
I think it 's obvious when we think about our needs .
We 're going to spend six billion in the next 40 billion to the next 40 years .
Right for example : I was born in 1946 .
Now , there are three people on the planet for each existing in 1946 , 40 years , there will be four .
We 're having problems now to find out that we 're fresh food , and clean water , medicinals and a half billion .
It 's going to be more tough to do it for nine billion .
We use more than five billion coal , more than 30 billion baries of oil .
That means percent million baries a day .
When we try to find biological processes , or whatever kind of process to reduce them , it 's going to be a huge challenge .
We need to keep the whole emissions of CO2 from these materials that ends in the atmosphere .
Now , thank you to scientific discoveries in the world , we have a database with about 20 million genes , and I like to think that are the components for the future .
The electronic industry only only is a dozen about components , and think about how many different things are come out .
Our limitations are here , the biological data from our imagination .
Now we have the techniques , thanks to these metods of synthesization , we call a combinatory genomics combatory .
We 're able to build a big robot that can produce a million cromosome million cromosome million cromosome .
Think about this 20 million genes or to try and try to get the processes of provide , and we can make optimize the processes , we can change , because of a little team , and we can change , because to a little team , and create more biology , and create more biology , and create more biology , that in the last 20 years of science .
And it 's just a standard selection .
We can choose for a chance of survival , chemical production , or fuel , production of ethical vaccines .
This is an instantaneous instantaneous instantaneous instantaneous standing and design species to the computer .
Well , we don 't know necessarily as they will be .
We know exactly what the genetic code .
Now we 're focusing on the carbon dioxide .
You also saw that extract from the grate was a finished experiment .
We have more than we have a second generation of the bigger and third generation of the highest bigar , and higher value , like the eighth of the high , or different types of butanle .
But the only way biology can have a big impact without increasingly increasingly the cost of food and limitar the cost of food and limitarne is the cost of the food , we 're working on the CO2 in matter , and we think we can get this discovering , and we think we can get this discovered , and we think we can get the first couple of what the generation in the same generation in about 18 months .
The sunlight sunlight with CO2 is a metodowntown -- but in our discoveries around the world , we found different metods .
This is an organism we 've described in 1996 .
She lives in the ocean , about 2500 feet of deep deep in the water of the temperature of the water .
They 're using a molecular hydrogen , and we have a molecular source .
We 're trying to understand if we can figure out the CO2 CO2 , which can be transported by the tubes , converse that CO2 in fuel , to drive this process .
So , we think we could be able to increase what we can increase the basic question what the basic is the question of what is life is . " We have the goal , and we have the goal of the obic goal to reduce the oil industry .
Exactly . If you can 't do it from TED , where you can ?
It would be a main source of energy .
And we 're working on using the same metods to create vaccines .
You saw this year with the influence , we 're always back a year , and with a dollar in less when it 's the gap is to find the fair .
I think that you can change building vaccines in a very ancient ances .
Here 's how the future could start to look changing , the tree of evolution , accelerating the tree , by the way , and you 'll get the synthetic ekariote .
We 're so much from the best people .
Our is to make a long enough enough to live long enough to try to do it . Thank you very much .
First of all I 'll show you , the most quickly possible , some fundamental work , the new technology that we took Microsoft in the following Microsoft , in the way , almost a year ago exactly . This is Seadragon .
It 's a environment that you can interact is to local level that remote with an enormous amount of data .
Here we 're seeing a very much gabytelling photos with a kind of zoom , and continuous queens , and continuous speed , for a panoramic sunlight , we want .
And it doesn 't matter how big the amount of information we see , how big these are the data or the images of data or the images .
Most of the photography , but this for example is a scanning from the Bioootie from the Congressed Biooowner of Congress .
It doesn 't make any difference because the only thing that limit the prestations of a system like this is the number of pixel on your screen on any time . It 's an architecture .
This is a whole book , example of data not from data .
This is the Casa desolate of Dickens . Every colonna represents a chapter .
And to show you that it 's just about text and not images , we can do something like that , to make something like that , to make a real thing , to show that it 's a real representation of the text , not a picture .
It could be a little artificial to read a book .
Don 't you reach it .
This is a more realistic example . It 's a number of the Guardian .
Every picture is the beginning of a section .
And it gives you the pleasure and the beautiful experience of reading the version of a revision or a quotidian , which is for nature a multiple of a lot .
We also did something with the corner of the Guardian .
We created a higher advertising advertising -- much more than that you use in a normal publicity -- and we put you in a normal advertising -- and we put you in the extra content .
If you want to see the cars of this automobile , you can see it here .
Or other models , or even the techniques .
And this really demonstrates some of these ideas to eliminate the limitations of space on the screen .
We hope that means you 'll end up to the pop-up and other pop-up pop-up and the downnnerable to be .
Of course , the map is one of the most obvious applications for this kind of technology .
And on this is not losing time , if we don 't say that we have contributes to this camp .
These are all the streets in the U.S. S. Siday , the NASA geospatial NASA .
So we go back to something else .
This is now effectively , you can see it . You can see it .
It 's a project called Photosynnnth , which combine two different technologies .
One is Seadragon , and the other is a visual research at Noah Snavior student of Washington , with Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Szeliskeli .
And it 's from Seadragon the Web , and it 's from Seadragon .
You can see that when we do this kind of screen , where we can go from an image to the other and have this kind of experience , and have this kind of experience multiple solution .
But the space space collization has actually a meaning location .
The algorithms of visualization of computers recorded these images , so that correspond to the real place in the real place that the image -- all screens , and all these things are close to the Grassi on the Montagne Roccious canady -- are screen . So , you 're going to . Here , the drugs of a slides , and these things have been all the space space stable .
I don 't know if I have time to show you some other environment .
There are some more space space .
I want to spend directly one of the original Noahhimself -- and this is from a previous prototype of Photosynnnnthrow that we did for the first time , the extending the technology , Photoxist , technology Photosynnnnntheless . And it 's not necessarily , by looking at the environment we put in the world .
We had to worry about the legal aspects and force .
This is a reconstruction of Notre Dame of the Notray , from Flickr , Baast , digitar Dame in Flickr , and you get images of the shirt , other campus and you get images in the shirt , other crop of these arancions are a image that it 's discovery appear to this model .
So they 're all pictures taken from Flickr , and they were all colleaged to the space space space space .
And it 's possible to navigate this way simple .
You know , I wouldn 't have thought about it end up Microsoft .
It 's very gratifically revenue this kind of accourious here .
I think you can see that it 's a lot of different kinds of different kinds of square of different smanufacility SLR , a professional number , they have meaning , in this environment .
And if I can go , I try to try to look for those strange .
Many of them are faces , except .
And you have some part of this is a series of photographs -- here it .
This is a Notre poster Dame registrated correcorded .
We can go from the poster to the physics of this environment .
The essential point is that we can do the environment with social environment -- from the entire memory , the collectively of how the land , from visual visual -- and college everybody else .
All those pictures become colleaged , more than the parts of the parts .
You have a model of the land that emerges .
Think about this as the Stephen Lawler 's work on Earth .
It 's something that grows in complexity as people use it , and the people use it , and the advantages for the use of the use .
Their picture are sitting with other people .
If somebody comes the idea of the idea of these things that is the name , my picture of Notre Great Dame improviously , you know , the picture of all this data , and I can use it as a way of engineer to immerging in that space , in that metaphor , in that metaphor , in that metaphing the picture of everybody , and the cle-model cle-like social , by red cle-model .
Of course , one consequence of this are virtual model of any interesting part of the land , in the land , and you 're not just satellitaries from satellitarian images and satellitarian images and satellitaries , but from the claim .
Thank you very much .
Chris Anderson : I understand ? What your software is going to do about doing is that your software is that a certain , in the next years , all the photographs , everybody in the entire world will be colleaged together ?
BA : Yeah . What 's doing is doing in practice is discover .
It 's creating hyperlink , if you want , between the images .
And it 's doing it in the basis in the content of the images .
The thing becomes very interesting if you think about it recognize of semantic information that many of these images are possible .
As when you make a research of images on the Web , you digital , and the text on the web page has a lot of information about the images of the picture .
Now , what happens if that picture you colleages to all your pictures ?
So the amount of semantic interconnection and the amount of rich , and the amount of rich is really huge . It 's a classic classic effect of the network .
CA : Blaise , it 's really amazing .
BAA : Thank you very much .
One of the main pleasure , when you travels and one of the research of the ethnographics that has no forget the anti-traditions , between the wind , the wind the wind , the touch in the wind , you 're driving in the wind leaves in the leaves of plants .
Basti think that Jaguar traveling beyond the Lattea , or that the mitititself of the Inuit are still a colms of meaningly , or that in Himalayas , the buddddawn the importance of Dharma , to remember the importance of the Dharma , to remember the importance of the world , and that the idea that the world in which we live in there , but it 's just a model of reality ,
the consequence of a particular set of adaptative choices that our stroes has done , or a lot of generations ago .
And of course , we all share of essential tracts .
All of it . All procreate .
We 're suggests to return out .
We need to deal with the inesorability of death , so we don 't surprising and ballize --
We all have an art .
What hits is the particular rhythm of the song , the dance of every culture .
It doesn 't matter that they 're the Borneo 's Borneo , or the following of Haiti , or the Haiti 's Borneum , or the Kaisut 's Kaisut in Kenya Saharmful cammmmaul in the heart of the Sahara .
He was my traveling journey in the desert a month ago , or a yak hyak , or a yak huge rings in the Everest , the mother of the world .
All these people teaching us that there are other ways of exists that there are other ways of model in the world .
And if you reflected a moment , it 's a concept that can give you hope .
Insized , the crazy of cultures creating a spiritual life and cultural life that we have the planet , and cultural well-being the planet as the planet as the biological ragnature .
And you can think about this cultural as a cultural as a ethnospherhere , and you can call the somma that we can call the total ethnosphere , inspiring , inspiration , inspiration , inspiration , inspiration , inspiring out of humans from the humans of consciousness .
The etnosphere is the patrimony of humanity .
It 's the symble of what we are and what we can be as inquisitive species .
And because the biosphere has been a very much consumed as it happened to the ethnosphery and purpointing much more free .
No biologist , for example , it would say that 50 percent of all the species has been or about the extinction of the extinction , because it 's false -- in the most apocalycle -- in the field of biological diversity -- and not even close to the power of the most optimistic -- that of the cultural diversity .
The index of this is , of course , the loss of languistic .
When you were born 6,000 languages on this planet .
A language is not only composed from a vocabulary or a series of rules .
A language is the shake of human spirit .
It 's the middle of which the animal is in the material world .
Every language is a forest of mind , a switch , a thought , a spiritual chance .
And of those 6,000 languages , as we 're sitting here in Monterey , at least half is not ssurrunning in the ear of children .
They 're not taught to kids , the kids , which means , unless you wouldn 't figure out something , which are already dead .
What 's more sad than being the silent of the silent , of being the last to talk to a language , not having a language , not having the wisdom or to ancils the children ?
This is a fashion , it 's the state of someone in the world every two weeks : every two weeks , a moment , and it 's dies in the last syllabes of a ancillabes .
And I know anybody to tell you , " Isn 't that better ?
The world would not be a better place if we 're all the same language ? " Benism , then we talk to yorba . Parlian cantonese .
Let 's talk about kogs .
You 'll cover a tract thing that means not talk about the language .
Today I 'd like to do you a journey through the labor --
a little journey in the etnosh to give you a little bit of what we 're losing .
Many of us forget that when I say , " different ways of existing existing very different ways of exists .
Let 's take for example Barasana , Barasana , in Amazonia , the popular sacrunning , which creds to the west river of the waste of the sacred by the west sacred .
It 's a popular that 's not able to distinguish the blue color from the green because it 's time , it 's identified in the forest , which depends the popular popular .
They have a strange language and a guller rule , detailable language : " You have to hope a person that talk about a different language .
All this radical in the past , yet the particularity is that in these families , in these families that are talking about six or seven languages , and seven marriages , no one language .
They 're limitate to listen to listen to talk .
Let 's take one of the most interesting tribes I lived , the Waorani Ecuador , the Waorani Eastonicuador a popular that has been contacts in 1958 .
In 1957 , they have been a comfortable contact to a comfortable contact .
They did come up from the photographed that they were in a popular popular popular forest , that this popular popular popular forest that this popular popular forest .
They have raised the picture of the land , they turned to the research of a shape and , not find the five , they have concluded that they were killed to the five missionarious with the sance .
But the Waorani , the Waorani only killed strange .
They killed between them .
The 54 percent of mortality was caused by themselves .
We 're sitting at eight generations , and we found two cases of death and when we indeed to know , they had a tuned of them that one of them was invected so that he was invited to kill it the same .
The cactors were able to recognize the urine animal from 40 steps and recognize it .
In the early 1980s , I was assigned a very interesting task when I was a professor in Harvard , asked me if I wanted to go to Haiti me to Haiti me a base of the power of Duvalier and Tonton Macoutes , and impossessing me in the walking of the willer used to make the zombic zombies .
To give a sense of miraculous , I would have to understand the Vodouth culture and that Vodouth is not magic .
It 's pretty much than a complex metaphysical vision of the world .
Very interesting .
If I ask you to tell me the great religions of the world , what would you say ?
Cristianesimum , Islam , Budddism , etc .
A continent comes up , thinking that the sub-Saharan Africa has not religious likely , and Vooodoo is not the religious distillate of these religious concepts of these religious concepts that we have a lot of profound religious concepts that we have a lot of profound herself .
What makes the interesting voodoo is the ninity relationship between life and death .
So , you know , the spirits .
The spirits can be invited by the Great Acqua , and they replacing back to the dance of the dance and they replaced temporary the soul of the way that for a shoring the way , it becomes the goal .
So , the voodooists love saying , " You can saying , " God .
We 're saying in the temple and divention God .
And from the moment you 're , is the spirit that you 're driving you , how can you do that ?
So you would see these incredible events : following voodoo in the state of trance that touch , a stronger demonstration rather than the power of mind , when it 's catalyzed in a state of outside the body when it 's catalyzed in a state of extreme extreme , excitation .
On the popular people with the most extraordinary people are the Kogi Sierra Nevada de Sierra Nevada de Sierra Nevada Colombia section .
Defully , the ancivilization of the advice of the Colombic Colombic in the conquirt of the conquirt , the population of the vulcanical .
In a mackicked continent , this popular a continent , this popular never been conquirt by the spages .
And so , they 're governed by a clero , but their formation is very extraordinary amazing .
The young people are taken away from the families to three or four years , and they live in a good world , and they live in a good world and shares in the base of the glacier for 18 years .
Two huge time of nine months to reproduce the nine months of gestation that turn into the user of the mother , are metaphically in the Great Mmother .
So , so that 's all over time , they get acculturated to their society , values that their predict and only their predict and only their predict and they keep the cost balance -- or to say the balance balance .
At term of this incredible beginning , they 're improvivisually taken out and for the first time in life , the age of the age of 18 years , they see an alba . And in that account of the first cut , when the sun gases of beautiful landscape , when the beautiful things have learned in the whole spending theory . The precisely is confermed in the way . The precisely behind , and says ,
" As ? I 'm going to be like you .
It 's amazing . Now it 's to you protect it .
They 're called the biggest brothers and say that we are , brothers , we are the colputting of the world .
This level level of intuition is extremely important .
When we think about indeed the environment , we think about the Rseau and the old story of the noble wild history of the noble self-wild , and we say that these people are closer to the war of us .
The indeed popular indeed with nor inbulitous , not inbolites from nostalogy .
There 's no space for these things in the paluds of the Aststmen or vent vinds of the Tibet , but because of the time and the rites , created a mistic Earth 's not on the concept of being known as well as close , but on an unknowledge , but on a by-such human consciousness .
What does that mean ?
That means that a boy of Ande that a boy of Ande that mountain Apu that mountain Apu that will drive his destiny is going to be a human being profound , and it 's going to have a different relationship with the mountain , and it 's going to be a different relation-boy , and it 's a boy of the Montana , and it 's going to be screens .
which is the hour of a spirit or a mineral , is irrelevant .
What 's interesting is the metaphor that defines the relationship between the individual and the natural world .
I grew up in the forest Columbia Britannica credating that the forest service served for being cut .
And so that I made a human being from my friends Kwakiutl that the forest is the forest of Hukuk and the waste of the paradimora of the paradise and the waste of the paradise and the dog downorth of the world , spirits that live in the early Hamateful initiation .
If you start to look at that these cultures can create different reality , you can start to understand some of their own sensationally sensationally , we take this plant .
I took this picture to open in the nornorthth-doccidental Amazonia .
Maybe some of you have heard about the ayahuge , the most powerful pricing prsiowned .
What makes the tagging tacking is not the physical potential of the sustaff , but his elaboration . It 's from two elements .
Actually , this liana leaving a series of pacarbolin , harmmoline , harmine , slightly slightly slightly sleep .
Take the only plant is a blue that alters a little bit the consciousness , but it 's misceled with the leaves of a familiar family said , " Psychotridis sliving .
This plant contains powerful triptamine , very similar to serious serotonin the middle , methoxylyptamines .
If you ever see Yanomami , you 're going to see the nase the substance that they do from a different set of species , switch , it 's methoxylyptamine .
After that polar on the nose is a bit like being disappeared by a fire square bults and landing on a mare of electricity . And it 's not a creates of electricity . It doesn 't creating the reality .
I would say , I often with my professor , Richard Evan Shultes , the man who waiting the was psychedelic , with his discovery of fungi in Mexico .
I 'm not going to be able to classified these tripamine as because if you 're not told , because if you 're not telling them anybody to be hallucinated . And I 'm not going to tell you , they can 't be horely hallucined because they 're money from a summer , because they 're money from a summmarized , because they 're money in the intestine , detailable .
It 's possible to absume that , if you 're just a little bit of the other chemicals that money the MAO .
Now , it 's the beautiful : the pathololin that liana are ininhibitors of MAs , the same kind of need to potential the tripamine . The question is , the source spontaneous source : in a free fall of plant deaths , like these popular popular version , but if you combined this , but if you combined this , creating a version of biochemical version of the parts ?
We use the great euliar of proof and error , that can reveal infruttify .
But if we ask the Indians , they 'll tell us , " The plants are talking about it . "
What does that mean ?
This tribes , the Cofan , has 17 variety of ayahuge , which they 're going to be in the forest , and that the eyes would be in the same species .
If we ask him as they 're saying , " I thought , " I would think I would say , " I thought about it plants , you don 't know that ? "
The solution is : you take the 17 variety of len and each other , and each other , and each source with a tone .
With this doesn 't have a ball at Harvard , but it 's much more interesting that content the stams .
Now , the problem is that even the people of us who have heart heart popular popular popular , but in some way , in some way , reduced to our real world , and it 's switches to our real world , and it 's over our real world , and it 's over .
In fact , the 20th century , between 300 years , it will not remembered for his wars or its innovations , but rather like the innovations , but rather as the era that we stopped and we have hurt actively , and we have a destruction of the planet , biological diversity of the planet . Now , it 's not the change .
All cultures through the seccoli have been involved in a dance for new chance of life .
And the problem is not the technology .
Indians don 't stop being Sioux , when they put from Sioux , when they put out and falling as the American have been American have been American when they put from the horse and calated .
It 's not the change or the technology that thnosat integrity . It 's the power .
The flight of domination .
And if you look at the world , you 'll find that these are not cultures are not cultures that these are not cultures that these are not cultures .
They are living creatures and dynamics are dynamics , identifiable forces that go beyond their adaptation .
Which is that you can disboscaring in the patria of the Penan Penan --
a populpulpulpull out of Sarak , in the Asian Sarak , a popular popular in the forest to a generation , and now reduced to the service , and now to the service , and then the prostitution on the rivers , where you can see the river the window of the rivers , where you can see the river of the Meridished Cinese Meridished , where the navels the horizon-towards Merious ,
To take the stage of the wood of the forest .
Or , in the case of Yanomami , are the disease that are the disease of the discovery of the gold .
If we 're going to move the Tibet , where I 'm doing a lot of research , you 'll see the hard domination of political domination .
As you 'll know the genocide , the physical extinction of a popular popular , but the ethnocide , the ethnocide , the ethnocide of lifestyle , not only is condent , but it 's not just condent , but they 're going to say , but it 's a strategy development .
And you can 't understand the Tibet , until you 're part of the beginning .
I lost the 6,000 miles from China in the Western China through the Tibet South Eastern , coming to Lhasa with a young colleague , but only came to Lhasa , I realized what the statistics is that we feel about .
6,000 sacred monuments in sacred and cends .
1.2 million people killed by the military military during the Cultural Revolution .
The father of this guy was ascritical at the Panchen Lama .
The means that it was killed to the Chinese Inasion .
His the worth of the Santity in Santity during the diaspora that has taken the popular in Nepal .
His mother had been impressed and his color was recognize .
It was brought to hide in two years at the age of two years , born under his gonna because he couldn 't live without him living without him .
The sister , that has been in the same , was in reeducation .
One day has been walked a day coffering a coffering coffiguring Mao and , for this transgression , was mession to seven years .
The Tibet of the Tibet can be insured , but the reinside of the popular is popular .
At the end , all you reduce to a choice .
We want to live in the world monocromationy or we want to according the world policymatic ?
The great anthropology Margaret Mead , before he died he said that his biggest was that , in our living towards the world , we 'll see the whole gamma of human imagination , we 'll see the whole gamma of human imagination , but one day we 'll wake up from a sonna sonna , but one day we 'll wake up from a sonna swake up from a sonto a sonce .
And it 's umillion of remember that our species is there for 600,000 years .
The Neolitical Revolution , which has gone to us agriculture , which has done us to the seed of the seed , and replacing the poetry of the sler , and we talk about 10,000 years ago .
The modern industrialized world has to be 300 years .
That several story not suggests that we have the answers that we have the challenges that we 're going to deal with the millennia that we 're going to go .
When these miric miric miric miric , what it means to be human , respond to 100,000 different voices .
And it 's in these answers that we all have risky the chance of being , we are , a species that has to make that all the people and all the people 's popular sances and all the people can traveling . And there are great moments of optimism .
I took this picture on the northird of the isolate Baffin , when I went to hunt hunt hunt with the Inuit , and this man , Olaya , he told me the wonderful story of his grandfather .
The government canady has been not always gentle with the Inuit and the 50s for the 1950s to stage our soulder , we 've rinkles in colonies .
The grandfather than this man refuted to go .
The family , teaching for his life , and he took him away all the arms , and all his attices .
You have to know that the Inuit doesn 't temit cold ,
The bunch of the sled-sled-sleeps were made of cartos .
The grandfather than this man didn 't intimise from the Arctic or the library that they were suffering .
It 's gaxed away , it 's calculate the pantalon skin and defected in his hand . When the photos , they 've been congelate , working on a moment .
He 's sprined on the door of this caccept and when I became solid , he killed a dog .
He walked up the dog , and created a blue , with the sacic cash created a sliterally , a sliterally , and it 's disappeared on the bald , and it 's disappeared on the ballows .
We want to talk about cavarsely with nothing ?
In the California , 1999 government that 's reached the total control of a territory area of the California and Texas the California and Texas mitting together .
It 's their new patria . It 's called Nunavut .
It 's an independent terric terrified .
One splendisplay of how a nation-state can recognize with his popular .
And , finally , I think it 's pretty obvious about at least who of us was in these remote zones of the planet , remote that they 're not remote remote .
For someone is home .
They represent sections of human imagination that they are represent at the high of these kids , as the dreams of these kids , as the dreams of the kids , become part of the geography of hope .
Finally , we are convinced that political , we are convinced that politicians will never get to nothing .
We believe the polemiics --
[ Applausi ] are not persuade , but we believe that stories can change the world , and maybe we 're the best institution to tell the world , and maybe we 're the best institution to tell the world stories of the world . Every month is 35 million lived .
156 countries transmitting our television canal .
Our revilists are literally laughter from millions .
Our work is traveling in the ethnosphere to bring our audience in the beautiful cultural slightly wrong from the way they can see , and hopefult-handing , they 're going to get the reveation of the anthropology : the world of exists , and we need to find a lifestyle of life in a world , and multicultural to the world .
where the wisdom of all the popular well-being contributing our collective well-being .
Thank you .
I 'm going to talk about some things I wrote in this book that I hope you 've heard more than you 've heard and try to evidence some colleages , in the case , not them .
I want to start with what I call " the " official dogma . "
The official dogma official dogma of what ?
The official dogma dogma dogma dogma dogma dogma is the official dogma : " If we want to massive the beneficial our citizens . "
The reason is , from a side , in the fact that freedom is in the same value , is precious , useful , essential for humans .
And the other is in the fact that if we are free , each of us can act for all that massive our well-being , without any decided to us , without any decide in our well-being ,
The way to massive freedom is massive freedom .
More choices , the most people are libalong , and more than they are the liberty , the bigger is their well-being .
This , I think , it 's so remarkable to be a deeply radicated in society that no one would submit to doubt it .
And it 's also deeply radicated in our lives .
I 'm going to show you some examples of what progress has made possible .
This is my supermarket . It 's not particularly great .
I lost a simple note about conditivent .
In my supermarket , there are 175 conditions , without content 10 variety of oil and 12 acks , and 12 acks , 12 aceps balsamic acepcious number of conditions in the crowd circumstance that no 175 of your wealth .
Here 's what the supermarket .
Then you go to the electronic store to buy a stereo : cass-clabeled , piag , piag , piaaaleft , padio ,
And in this single negotie of electronics , there 's a great number of components of components .
We can make six million and a half of different combinations using the components that there are only in a store .
You need to admit that there is a lot choice .
Other the camps : the world of the communications .
Once , when I was a child , you could get all the phone services of the phone baby , and they were forned by mamma Bell .
It was for the phone , you didn 't buy it .
A consequence of that , between the phone was that the phone never break .
These days are gone .
Now we have a variety of phones , especially between the phones .
Here 's the cell phones of the future .
My favorite is in the middle , MP3 , cut of the nose , and the baby for the burst , and forcing the burst for the burch .
If you don 't see that in the negotium , you 're not seen in the home , you 're going to get it .
And what the end is happening is that people enters in the store and ago this question . And you know , you know , the answer is ? The answer is " No . "
It 's not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn 't make it too many things .
So , in other aspects of life that are much more important than the burning of the aquences of choices .
Addge health , health care : it 's not happening in the United States , you have to go to the doctor and the doctor , what you have to do .
Instead , you go to the doctor , and the doctor says , " OK , we can do A , or B , " As , we can do it , or B , " A " A has these benefits and these risks " B has these benefits . What do you do ? "
You know , " Doctor , what would I do I do ? "
And the doctor says , " As has these benefits and these risks , and these benefits and these benefits . "
" What do you want to do ? "
And you rebuts , " Doctor if she was me , what would you do ? "
And the doctor : " But I 'm not she . "
The result of the result of the disease , expression that it seems to look like a beautiful thing .
But it 's not that a move the fish and the responsibility of taking somebody knows the doctor , to somebody else knows the doctor , to somebody else -- and it 's almost certainly is sick -- and so it 's not in the ideal to make the patient decisions .
There 's a huge marketing of drug products , direct people like me and you , that if you think , it 's not a sense , because we can 't buy them .
But if we can 't buy them , why we publishing them ?
The answer is that they want to doctor we call the doctor for asking us to change the rich .
Whatever the fundamental as our identity is a question of choice , as you see in this vision , " We don 't want to force the children . " We don 't want to force the children . " We don 't want to get the same as a sex identity : we need to invent .
And we can reinventing how many times you get us .
That means that every morning , at the morning , you have to decide that kind of person wants to be .
I reach the family and marriage , a time time , a common perspective , almost for anyone , was that they were swalking the most soon as possible , and he was going to the most soon as possible .
The only real choice was choice with who , not when , and not when , and not even what to do after .
And it 's really to play .
I teach very smart students , and I do 20 percent of work , at less than a time .
And not because they 're not because they 're less , not because they 're less diligent .
But why are they impensionally , I 'm going to ask , " I 'm going to spoke or not ? I 'm going to do that right now ? "
" Do I 'm going to get to think about before the kids or the career ? "
They 're interrogatives .
And they 're trying to answer these questions , even if this implies not completely compassumplying the tasks that above my own extended .
And they really have to do that . They are important questions .
Now , the work : we 're lucky , as Carl Sarl Sarl , because the technology allows us to work every day , every single day , from the Hotel Randolotel .
And I 'm going to talk about , there 's a corner , and I 'm not going to tell you , where the WiFi works .
I don 't tell you , because I want to use it .
What does this incredible freedom of choice we have about work ? That 's what we need to keep , continually decide , if we need to work or not .
We can go to see our son playing , with the cell phone in a pocket , the Blackberry in the other , and the notebook , and the notebook , and the notebook ,
And even though they are , every minute that we see our son , we see our baby , we 're also asking , " Do you say , " Do you say , " Do you say , " Do you say , " Do you know , " I have to answer the balance , we 're also asking , " Do you see our baby , we 're also asking
" Do I have to answer this letter ? I have to habling this letter ? "
And even when the answer is no , " all this makes the experience of your son , very different than what it would be in other conditions .
So , from any part of the big things , and big things , materials and the lifestyle , life is a question of choices .
Once the world was this : Obvivious , there were some chance , but not all that was a question of choice .
The world of today is a good thing , is , " Is it a good thing , or negative ? "
The answer is , it 's Shycle .
The snaked slaps , so I 'm going to talk about the negative ones .
All this choice two negative effects two of people .
The first one , paradoxally , is that produces paralysis that produces instead of liberation .
With the options of the choose to choose , becomes very hard to do it .
I 'm offerer a meaning example : a conducted on the plans of volunteer than the plans of volunteer .
A colleague has had access to the Vanoly-based data , the gigantic society , with about a million clients in 2,000 different companies .
What she discovered is that for every 10 solutions that are offered in more , the percentage of two percent .
With 50 source of offered , there 's 10 percent of adesions than the one is about five percent of them . Why are you available . Why
Because with 50 source of the floor , is maledly hard to decide , and the choice is remained up to the inequal .
And then , of course , and I 'm asking , questions , of course , and questions never get .
You know that doesn 't only means that these workers are going to be hators for dogs because they don 't have enough money , it means that the decision is that they lose the decision is so ostic that they lose the funds of complementary .
Don 't participating , they 're losing until five dollars for the year from work , which would be bought to be , and so forth .
So the paralysis a consequence of having too many choices .
And I think that makes the world like that .
" And finally , " ethernity : ketchup , or maionese ? "
You want to take the right decision , if it 's for ethernity , if it 's for ethernity , if it 's for ethernity , if it 's for ethernity , if it 's for ethernity , if it 's for ethernity , if it 's for ethernity , if it 's for ethernity , if it 's for the ethernity , if it 's for the easy , if it 's for the ethernity , if it 's for the easy , if it 's for easy , if it 's for ethernity , if you want , if you want you want to take for ethernity , if it to take
You don 't want to choose the source , and not want to choose the wrong condition .
So this is the first effect . The second one is that we can avoid the paralysis , and make a choice , we 're less than the result of how we would be we be with less options of how we would be with less options between which choose .
And this for several reasons .
One of these is that with many conditions of that choose , if you buy one and it 's not perfect , and it 's not perfect , you can imagine that you could make a different choice . And what 's happening is better . And what 's happening is the alternative ince the walternative imagined us . And the recovered the decision ,
And even when it was a good decision .
More choice , there are , the more is easy of any detail than any detail that 's insod-insatisfied option .
Also , there 's what economists call constood is constood .
Dan Gilbert assumpley , very well , stamatic , we 're going to things about what we 're in the face .
In the rest , when there are many options of the options of the features of the alternative characternative , and be less unsatisfacts of the option that is choice .
Here 's an example . I school with all the people who are not New York .
But that 's what you probably think about .
There 's this couple to the Hamptons .
a place of luser .
It 's beavails . Ottimate days . It 's all about them .
Nothing . But what he thinks is , " Well , malth , it 's Augment . "
" All my neighbors at Manhattan are away . "
" I could talk about front of home . "
And it 's two weeks , from the idea that 's losing -- every day -- the chance of parking -- the chance of parking to where it wants .
The constood opportunity is the satisfied for what we have , even when the choice was an excellent .
And more are the options we have to consider , the more the characteristics that are going to be returned against as constantly constantly ,
Here 's another example .
This vignize us a lot of things .
We talk about living the moment , and maybe living slowly .
But the most important thing you choose to do , you know , you choose to do not do the other .
The things that we don 't choose are many attractive attractive that can make less attractive than we do .
Third point : it 's growing the expectative of the expectations .
I tried it on my skin beating a new jeans .
Again , almost always jeans .
Once the jeans were only one like , they bought them and vestivestivestivestivestivestivestilies , they were saying a life and work , they started to go well .
So , I went to buy a new when the old old old old those old were gone , and I said , " I need a couple of jeans , this is my cut . "
The commit tells me , " He wants to slim , he relaxed up ? "
He wants with the cernier or with the bottom , " Stonewashed , " or " acached ? "
" Do you want them stricted ? "
" Sotto them wants to them to large them , and the ball , " Continured to elenenenenenaging .
I was sitting , and after a while I was able to say , " I want the kind of -- I want the kind of -- that was the only kind of , " He didn 't have idea what it was , so for a hour , jeans , and then I came out from the war , I would have the best pair of jeans that ever had .
It was the massive . I had got the best .
But I felt to me .
Why ? I wrote a book to understand it .
The reason I was worse about that I was with all the same choice , the myself , the jeans had to be perfect .
I was waiting the minime . I won 't expected me about it when he was only a kind of a kind , but when it 's 100 different , but when you live 100 different , and they were like ,
What I had was burst , but not perfect .
After I had compared that chosearching with what I was trying to do in compared to the expectative .
The addition of options in life does not increasing the expectations that these are respond to the options of the options of the same .
And this will produce less soddisfation , even when the results are good .
Nobody in the world of marketing in the world of marketing .
Because if you know , if you know what I 'm talking about .
The truth looks more like this .
" He was better when he was worse , " The reason it was better when he was worse , it was worse , when it was worse , it was still possible to meet the surprises .
Now , the world that we live in -- opulents , industrialized citizens with the expectancy of perfefeeling -- the massive we can hope is that the altitudes are at the alteight of expectative .
You never have surprised pleasures because your expectations , the myself is ingiant .
The secret of happiness -- what you 're here -- is , " Basse expectative " Yes , " Yes , you want . "
I mean -- small autobiographic moment -- that I 'm really sposed and my wife is really amazing .
I couldn 't have to do better , I didn 't have happy .
But you know , it 's not a good thing .
Finally , a consequence of jeans , when you 're only that kind of jeans is that when you 're just that kind of jeans is that when you 're not satisfied , and you say , " Why ? "
" Who is responsible ? "
The world is the responsible . What can I do you do ?
When there are hundreds of jeans , and you buy a satisfactor , and you ask you who is responsible , and you ask you who is responsible , is the responsible , is that responsible , you know .
You would have done better .
With hundreds of available variety , there are no insuccess .
So when people take decisions , even if the result is , they 're saying , they 're sitting and they give the colcollide to them .
In the last years of the last years of the industrialized world .
I think a meaning factor -- not the only , but important -- of this honto the one depression of depression is that people are the experiences of the date is too high .
And when they have to explain this situation think that colcolcolcolors are .
So the final result is that we 're better in general , but we feel worse , we feel worse .
Let me remember .
This is the official dogma dogma , what we all take for good and it 's completely fake .
There 's no doubt that a little bit of choice is better than haven 't at it , but it 's not at a little choice is better than a while .
There 's a critical value , magic value . I don 't know what it is .
But I 'm sure we 've been super-handing the level where the choices better our lives .
Now , from political point of view -- I have a political point -- from political point of view , the political nocity is the following .
What 's allows all this choice in the industrial society is material .
There are many places in the world , and you know about it , where the problem is not that they have too many choice .
The problem is that they have too a little bit too .
So the face of the cenda I 'm talking about is a modern exclusive of modern , recognize society .
And what he does to have to be this : Steve Levitt talked about how those things that is and discovered you to tell yesterday , and discovering for whatever they are inuuuuuuuuseful .
I mean these choices , complicated and dispenous , it 's not just inuses .
They 're admitting of the path .
They 're going to be worse or .
If a little bit of what in our society allows is reverse in those people have been switch in the people , it would be better , not only their lives better , but our life .
This is what the economists call a paretian improvement .
A redistribution of the refined record is good at all -- not only to the poor -- because of this choice in a little mental .
And to conclude , " Look , you can get everything you want , "
You know , people of culture , you think , " What does that fish ? "
" It 's obvious that you can 't get into a glass . "
" A castrated imagination , a limited vision of the world --
and that 's what I interpreted , so on the beginning .
But then , I realized that fish , I realized that fish the knowledge .
Because the reality of fact is that if you send to the bocket , so that you can 't get the freedom . You get the liberty .
If you break the bocket so that all you can diminuliitous satisfy .
Accentuate the paralysis , and you 'll reduce the well-being .
All they need a sphere .
This is almost certainly too , maybe for the fish , and certainly for us .
But the absh of some symbolic symbolic symbolic sphere is a recipe for the roin the cin .
Thank you very much .
