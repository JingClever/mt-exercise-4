I showed this year , I showed these slides to show that the glacial calculate , which for almost three million years had been the size of the 48 States , is reputed the 48 percent .
But this subjects that gravity , because it doesn 't show the spessor of the ice .
The arctics is , in a way , in a way , the heart sense , the heart of the global climate system .
It 's inverinter and you get summer .
The next slide is going to be a quick carlessed on the last 25 years .
The ice lost lost of drives are red in red .
And you can see , they 're going to the blue up until the blue .
That 's the ice in invernal , which is reverse .
You can see that the cosid-square , along , of five years or more , is like the blood , which is like the blood , which is like the blood , which is like the blood ,
In 25 years , it 's been so , like this .
This is a problem because the warming is the interest in the ocean , where there are huge amount of coal coal , where there are huge amount of coal congle that , scientists , they 're transformed into the microbes .
I replowing totality of the atmosaving of global warming , that quantity could doubling , superformance this point of not .
In some deep in Alaska little deep in Alaska , the metano is already rebuling from the water .
The Katey Walter of the University of Alaska , was recently recently , was a bunch of the University of Alaska ,
Video : Wow ! Al Gore : Wow ! Al Gore is good . We 're going to be .
A reason is that this termal exchange is that that 's surrive in the northern Greenland .
This is a glacial river .
He never reached it had never reached levels .
This is the Kangerlusaq , in the wast Souast , the Greenland .
If you want to know how the level of the sea level of the sea level of the sea , here is where , where it 's where it 's reaching .
These corrings are increasing rapidly .
Another of the planet : Antarctica , the biggest block of the planet .
The month , the scientists have dishes that the balance of the ice is in negative , and that Antarctica , which poor in some islands on some islands , which is particularly in some islands .
Equital at six feet , like in Greenland , like in Greenland .
On Himalaya , the biggest blob block , you see new laghi , which is a few years ago , that were a few years ago ,
Forth percent of the world 's population will be population half the water population .
Sull Ande : this glacier is the source of the powerful water source of this city .
It 's increased it .
But when it decreases , the same happens to the water .
In California the snow on the Sierra Nevada is 40 percent .
The idricious water is in crisis .
The predictions , like you read , they are graves .
The growing growing secure in the world leads to a remarkable increase incends .
The environmental disasters are increasing a rhythm out of the normal and without precedented .
Four times more number of times in the last 30 years , I 'd respect 75 .
This is a whole sustainable .
If you can look at it in the stories if they can see the consequences .
In the last five years we 've added 70 million tons of tons of CO2 every 25 million tons of tons in the oceans every day .
Look at the East area of the Pacific area , from the Americas , to the Americas , to the west , and on both the parts of the Indian exactly impoor in the oceans .
The biggest resolving , global warming , together to deforestation , which is 20 percent of fossil fuels .
The oil is a problem , and the coal is even worse .
The United States is one of the two countries with more emissions , together at China .
And he was going to build a lot of other middle .
But we 're seeing to a change of direction .
These are annoullated projects in the last few years and some proposes of alternative proposes .
Every way , there 's a politics in our country .
The coal industries and oil industry have spent 250 million dollars in the last year for promoting coal , which is a by-gymold .
And that image me was going to be --
I 'm Natal , in the Tennessee , where I live , there was a 3.8 billion gloss of carbon dioxide .
Maybe you saw it on the news .
This is the second biggest flow of scories in America .
It happened around the Natal .
The nature of one of the coal commercial was this .
Video : Frosty the carbon , it 's a pleger and happy .
It 's abundant here in America , and it 's our economy .
Frosty carbon is more and more and more .
It 's a good price , adorable and workers are keeps .
Al Gore : Al Gore 's here 's a West Virginia .
The biggest minerary society is Massey Coal . This is his mountains . This is his ministrator .
Video : Don Blankenship : I 'm going to be -- Al Gore , Nancy Peloges , Harry Rid -- not know what they 're talking about .
Al Gore : So the Alleance for the Proteition of Clima has launched two campaiged .
This is one of them , one part .
Video : Actor : Actor : Actor , we see the climate change as a threat at our business .
So , our priority is to invest a great amount of money in a force public in a force to make public and confused to make the truth .
In fact , coal is not sports .
We think it 's clean -- it 's also a good provide .
So not preocupateves of climate change .
Let 's do it .
Video : Actor : Carbone , you 've heard about it .
So let 's do you get a turn in a structure at the pattern of the clean .
Straordinary ! The machines are a little noise , but that 's the sound of the clean technology of clean .
The coal consumption is between the main global warming , but the remarkable technology , but the night of the clean technology that you see changes everything .
You look at a look , this is the hodiernal technology .
Al Gore : In the end of the positive alternative connects to the economic question and at the national security .
Video : Comvalvalue : The America is in crisis , national security , national security , climate crisis .
The flows that all : our dependence on fossil fuels , like the fuel , the couple and oil .
Now , there 's a new , a new , cars solution for used to use .
Repower America : 100 percent clean energy , in 10 years .
A plan to put America to work , make sure , and make sure , and help us more secure , and help us stop global warming .
It was inally , a solving that solving our problems .
Repower America . Scover more .
Al Gore : This is the last .
Video : It 's about re-in-handing energy in America .
One of the fastest ways to get the degree of the combustic dependence that killed our planet .
What 's the future is here . Vinininstruments , soles , a new energy network .
What do you do , in the way , we can invest for the workers of work .
Coming : Repower America . It 's time to be realistic .
Al Gore : A vast African proverbio says , " If you want to go fast , you go from the wind .
If you want to go away , go together . "
We have to go away , quickly .
Thank you very much .
I did this last year at TED , I did an introduction on the LHC .
And I promise to figure out on how the car works .
So here I am . And for those that the other time , there were no LHC is the biggest scientific experiment ever -- 27 kilometers of circusterence .
His task is to remember the conditions that were less than a billion second of the universe -- until 600 million times a second .
All that 's just environment .
This is the car under Ginevra .
We 're taking these mini-Big mini-Bang in the remarkers .
This is what I work . It 's called ATLAS -- it 's 44 feet , and it 's a 22 meters .
This is an image of ATLAS in building , in built , so you can see the proportions .
Ten September last year , we have accesuate the machine for the first time .
And this picture was taken by ATLAS .
It was immense to huge control in the challenge .
It 's an image of the first particles that had done everything of the LHC , entering in collision , by a part of the LHC , and it spread particles in the lHC , and spread particles inside the reator .
In other words , when we see that image 10 , the September , we found that the machine worked , which is a great victory .
I don 't know if that was this to do exultent more or that , when someone went on Google and saw that the initial page was this .
That means that we had a cultural impact beyond that scientific .
About a week later , there was a problem with the car , because of these dored drugs here -- these dored dored drugs .
These flower to 13,000 amps when the machine works at the maximately works .
Now , the technicians between you look at the children and say , " It 's not true . I 'm too much flower . "
And they can do that because when they 're very cold slow-became cosidy-patterns .
So , at less 271 degrees , at a temperature at the inferior at that of the star of the space between the stars , these flows can bring that corporate .
In one of the longest nails in the LHC , there was a fabrication of fabrication .
So the flower is surries , and the 13,000 amps , and the 13,000 practiced improved met a electrical resistance .
This was the result .
Now , this is even more impressive if you think these magnets more than 20 tons , and that have been moving more than 20 tons , and that have been moved about 30 centimeters .
They 're damaged about 50 mages .
We had to take them , what we had to do .
We have them and repristined them .
Now , they 're all back to their place on the ground place .
I mean , the end of the LHC will be again .
We 're going to accinate it , and we 're expecting it to go so on our adventure to figure out what the morning to discover what the morning for the universe .
Now , of course , in a way , these accidents reaching the debate of science and engineering in frontier . It 's easy to confuture .
I think that 's so difficult , the fact of the way to go beyond the limits , I think it 's the value of things like the LHC .
I want to conclude with the words of a Inglese scientist , Humphrey Davy , which , imagine , in defense experiments of his own puzzle , Michael Faraday , he said , " Nithing was like , " Nithing was very dangerous for the human mind , how much human lightful rhytheld , and that 's not in the worlens , and our world-owners are . And that 's not completely conquirst . "
Thank you .
I want to start asking you to start to ask you about the kids , play with the morning , you play with the morning .
And as you get them and you 're going to get them and you get them , and you learn how to move them , and you learn how to think and solving problems and manipulating relationships .
The space is deeply connected to the way we understand a lot of the world around us .
So , as information is , inspired by our interaction with physical objects , with my consultant Patts , and my collaborator Jeevan Kalanithi , I started to ask me , " And if we use a computer , instead of having only curror like craft pastry that moving on a desktop of the digital polluting physically an information with the manufaces ,
and we have to sistemard-pleasure ?
The question was so interesting that we decided to explore the answer , building the answer , building the Siftable .
In a few words , a Siftable , a computer interactive interactive as a cookay .
In a few words , a Siftable , a computer interactive interactive as a cookay .
You can move them with the hand , they can see the movement and they can see their movement and have a radio screen and a radio wireless .
But most photos , I 'm physicists , like the morning , you can just move it to be able to be moving them .
The Siftable is a new ecosystem of tools to manipulate the digital information .
And as they get more physicists , consciously , the movement of the other , and as they become more physicists , conscious , the other , of how we move , we can explore new and different estyle and different estyle .
I 'm going to start with a few example .
This Siftable is configurated to show the video : if you include it in a direction , the video running it , if you including the other side back .
These interactive rats are aware of other .
If you 're interested in what they are interested in what they 're around .
If they 're surrounded , and they can be agreed with a little bit .
If they 're surrounded , and they can be agreed with a little bit .
They have their movement and inclination .
We then realized that one of the interesting implications of the interaction was the power of the interaction was the power of data , for example , " putting , " a color like a liquid .
In this case , we have three Siftable configurated as a sect of real nice and I can use them to the color in the midle , where they mix .
and I can use them to purching color in that central , where they mix .
If we 're too much , we can put a little bit of place .
There 's also beautiful possibility of learning , like languages , mathematics and games where people can try and see things quickly , and you see the results of the immediately , and you see the results immediately .
Now , I 'm --
This is a Fibonacci sequence that I do with a equations of equations .
We have a word of words that 's half in Scarabean and Boggle .
Basically , at every turn a letter in a letter case on every Siftable , at every turn to every turn on every turn to a letter on every turn to every Siftable , and while you 're trying to understand words him on a direceither .
Then , after about 30 seconds , they 're remissing , and you have a new set of reading and new possibility to try .
Thank you .
Here 's the kids were in the game at the Media Lab , I did so they try and took a video .
They are very much .
And one of the interesting things about this kind of application is that you don 't have to give people many education .
You 've got to say , " We 're going to do it . "
Here 's how other people who are trying to do it .
This is our younger head , right there on the right .
It really wanted to impilate them .
They were only morning , for him .
Now , this is an interaction of a cardboard .
We wanted to build a tool for the learning of the Lui , is Felix .
It can put new characters in the scene , solving the Siftable , they 're sold to the Siftable them .
It can put new characters in the scene , solving the Siftable , they 're sold to the Siftable them .
Here , it 's doing the sun .
Video : The Sun is surprising .
David Merrill : Now he brought a tractor in the scene .
Video : The Augan : Augan .
Bababsolutely ! Yeah ! Yeah ! Yeah .
So I was at Siftable and put them neighbors can interact the characters --
Video : Bau !
and by inventing their own story .
Video : Ciao !
DM : It 's a final story with the wind , and he can decide him how it 's been .
DM : It 's a final story with the wind , and he can decide him how it 's been .
Video : Voly ,
DM : The last example I have the last example I 've been going to show you is a tool , realized , to walk and execececequal music .
It 's a tool , recently , to please and exececk music .
The Siftable here are agism here , based and the bacteria .
Each of these has four different variations , and you can choose what to use .
You can also be insert these sounds in a sequence from your feet .
And they 're going to move it to a sound , and a sound " and a sequence . "
These are actually that you can control from the vive , like the reverbs and the filter .
I 'm going to a particular sound , and then including it .
And then there are the general effects as time and fly , and they applicate , which you applicate the whole sequence .
Let 's look like it works .
Video : DM : We 're going to start putting a base in two Siftable , we 're going to get it , we add , we add it , add other base .
I put a line of basis .
Video : DM : I 'm going to be able to be --
Video : And I 'm going to put the filter of the bacteria , so I can controlling the effect of the alive .
Video : DM : I can faste the entire sequence the entire sequence by one side or the other .
Video : And I 'm going to go to the filter the basement to get more expression .
Video : DM : I can recombine the sequence " at the flight . "
So I don 't have to plan it first , but I can improvising it , longer or more corta .
And now , I can do , I can sleep the entire sequence inclinking to the left Siftable . "
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is to build new interface murder , and more and more more more and more more than our brain how our brain work .
And today , I had time to show you one of the results of this pattern , and also some chance that we try to get out of the lab .
The concept that I want to transmit is that new generation of designing this new generation of designing , to interact with digital media , which will bring information in our world way we want .
Thank you very much .
I don 't see the hour to talk to all of you .
I 'm a writer .
I 'm writing books , but it 's more than that , of course .
It 's also love and my life in my life .
And I don 't expect that it can change .
But , I said , something particular happened in my life and my life in my life and my career , who brought me to realibrate the entire relationship with this work .
The particular thing is that I recently wrote this book , this biography called Manogy , " Ama , " which , diversity , but in which , diversity from my previous books , for some reason that world and become a big sensational sensational , bestseller .
And the result is that everywhere 's going to be now , people treat me as if you were convicted .
It 's true -- convicted , convicted ,
They 're going to me now all worried and they say , " You don 't get the feet of doing better ?
You don 't fear to keep in the living of all life without being able to create a book that can be able to do a book that can do someone ? "
what can do ? "
It 's rassume , you know .
But it could go worse , in the most of the 20 years ago , when I started to say people -- I was an adolescent , I was a writer -- I was a writer .
I 'd go to the same reaction of the same reaction .
And people said , " Don 't themes I 'm not going to be able to succeed ?
You don 't have the equal refected kills ?
You don 't afraid to do this for all life without any life without being ever come and die on a cumull of the infrants with the mouth of faultural faulure ? "
So , you know .
The answer -- the short answer to all these questions is , " Yeah . "
Yeah , I afraid of all those things .
I 've always had afraid .
And I also argue of many other things that people could not have to have .
As the algae and other things .
But , as it was written about what I thought , and I was going to be finished ?
Is it rational ?
It 's logical that everyone who has to expect to be spected by a job that you 've been born to do .
But what 's there so particular in the creative impress to make nervous about the health health health care about the health health care , in a way that other carry ?
As my father , for example , he was a chemical engineer and I don 't remember a only time in his 40 years of activity where he was asked if he fear to be engineer ?
It wasn 't -- that block of John , how do it is ?
It didn 't work like that , you know ?
Onests , chemical engineers like group don 't certainly , in the check , the reputation of being handed in the reputation of being maniacual .
We writers , we have enough this reputation , and not just the creative , but creative of all that we have this reputation of being huge .
And they 're not going to look at the sad of the death magnificent death , just in the century century , just in the century century , they 're often , and often for them .
And those who are not suicipate to be really disdisfaced by their dons .
Norman Mailer , before I die , in the last interview said , " I killed a little more . " I killed a little more . " I 've killed a little bit more . " I think about their life .
But we don 't blew up when we feel that because we 've heard these things that in a long way we 've completely interized and accepted the notion that creativity and suffering are in some way , and the art , at the end , at the end , will be , and then , at the end , will be will be able to be .
And the question I want to get to everybody here today is : you 're agreed with this idea ?
It 's good that 's not good at this . Because also look at a centimeter , not good for me , but it 's not good for anything that suppose .
I think it 's hath .
And I think it 's also dangerous and I don 't want to see the perpetuated century .
I think it 's better encourage our big creative minds to live .
And I know that , in my case -- in my case -- in my situation -- would be very dangerous to start fire out at that heading , especially date the circumstances where I 'm in my career .
I 'm doing it , I 'm pretty young , I 'm pretty young , I 've been about 40 years .
I 've got about four decades in me .
And that 's very likely that whatever I 'm going to be right now , and then it 's going to be judged by the way , after my last book .
I 'm going to be square , because we 're all more or less friends here -- is likely that my great success is my best success is in my mies .
Oh , Gesus , who thought !
You know this is the kind of thought that leads to a person in the nine , and I don 't want to do it .
I would be to continue to do this work that I love .
So , the question is , how do you do that ?
And so it seems , after many reflections , that the way to work to keep on the way to keep on the psychological costruction , OK ?
I had to find a security among me , which I 'm writing , which I 'm writing , and my natural anxiety on which is going to be able to get . And as I was trying to do this year , looking through the time , trying to find other societies to see if they could have the best ideas and snake .
about how to help creative people to manage the inherent people who are emotional of creativity .
And that research has led me to the ancient Great and ancient Rome .
I 'm going to do it because it was in circle and then back .
In the ancient Great and ancient Rome -- people didn 't seem to believe that creativity was involved by men , OK ?
It was thought that creativity was this spirit is about the divine and it was to be unknown and that was in the men someone distant disconodent , for reasons , for reasons , for reasons and unknown .
The greeeigning , they were called the creativity of creativity " demons . "
Socococcurred , it was thought of that , it was going to be able to have a demon that wisdom .
The Romanufaces were the same idea , but they call that kind of spirit a genius .
And that 's great , because the Romanivers wasn 't really thought that a genius was somebody 's really smart .
They had to be that a genius was this sort of entity that had lived in literally in the walls of a artist , a little bit like the elfy Dobby , and that was out of the elfy Dobby , and that was going to be outside the artist and model the outcome of that job .
It 's a nice -- here is the distance of which I talk about -- that psychological cougical that you protected from your work .
And everybody knew that was so that it worked , right ?
So the anti-to-by-protected artists were protected by certain things , right ?
If you could not take all the goods , you could not take all the goodd , all knew that they had been helped by this genius .
If your failure , it wasn 't all your own , right ?
Everybody knew that was your genius to be a incapable .
And so people han concept the creativity in Western for a long time .
And then Rinascivvvvent came and everything changed , and nacious this big idea ; we put the human being at the center of the universe all the misters and without leave space to the mitizens that wrote by divinity .
This was the rational principle of humans and people started thinking that creativity was completely by the ishared ishared .
And for the first time in history , you start to refer this or that artist as a rather than a person with the genius like a rather of the genius .
And I have to tell , I think that was a big mistake .
I think that allow someone , just a simple person to believe that you can be like a recipient as the source , and the essence of all the divines , creative , inosconnected , inosis a psychchc responsibility to the human psychches .
It 's how to ask somebody to inguishing the sun .
It forms completely ego and distores completely the ego and creates all these inextent .
And I think it was this pressure to adstroyed the artists in the past 500 years .
And , if that 's true , and I think that 's the question is , and now ?
We can do it different ?
Maybe back to a more ancient understanding of human relationship between human and creative relationship .
Or maybe not .
Maybe we can 't cell 500 years of rational thinking in a 18 minutes .
And there 's probably people between the audience that would be reading scientific that would be about the notion of the notion of , unsometimes , you do , you do people who are follow the projects .
I 'm probably going to convined you all about this .
But the question that I 'd like to get is -- why not ?
Why don 't you think that way ?
Because it 's more sense of anything that ever ever heard to explain the exasperformance of the creative process .
A process that , as everyone who ever ever ever tried to do something -- so , basically , all here -- everybody here -- knows , you don 't understand rationally .
And in fact , sometimes , it can sometimes completely paranormal .
I did this meeting with the extraordinary poetetesse , Ruth Stone , who has now 90 years , but that was a poetesse for all life and said to me that during his childhood in the rural childhood , and working out in the rural , and it was in the rural , and it was in the landscape .
He said , he was like a fragorous of air .
And that was rotulating to her from landscape .
It was going to be , because he was so they 'd take the land under its feet .
He knew to have one thing to do about that point and it was , " run , " run like a math . "
And so it 's back to the home and he was going to be following up with this poetry , and he wouldn 't have to make a piece of paper , and it 's a fast , and he wasn 't going to be on the page .
Sometimes you couldn 't be fastern enough , so it goes and run and run it wouldn 't get to the home and the poetry was through the landscape , and he would keep it through the landscape , trying to , how she said , " another poet . "
And then there were those times -- this piece of never forget -- there were moments where it was almost almost losing , OK ?
So , he was running back home and he was looking for the card and the poetry was going through , and he was going to be saying , and then he said , that he was going to be sleep with the other hand and the step .
He was offered the poetry from the tail and put it in his body and transmit on the page .
And in these cases , the poetry would be presented on the perfect page and intrigus , but on the last word at the first word .
So when I felt that -- it 's crazy , it 's exactly equal to my creative process .
I 'm not a creative process -- I 'm not a condition .
I 'm a mule , and my way to work is ; you wake up at the same time and saying and work and saying and work and go on and go on and go on on the goal .
But even I , in my head , I 've stripped against that thing , sometimes .
And I think that 's also a lot of you , you know ,
You know , even if the work and ideas were giving me from a certain source , I could not be honestly .
And what is this thing ?
And how can we relationship to do it , but , what do , but , rather , but , rather , what does that do you get healthy ?
And as it is , as the best example of the contemporary example I have is the Tom Micista , which I interviewed in Tom Waits , which I interviewed in a newspaper .
We were talking about this , and you know , Tom , for most of life was the incarnation of the article of life was returned , trying to check , trying to check , and we 're going to be able to control these species of creative impulses .
But then I invited , he got to calculate , and one day as he was driving on a car in L.Angeles , changed everything for him .
He was going to go speak and all of a sent traction , this little sent framment of melody , which is inspiration , elusive , and the test , and it wants , you know , it 's wonderful , and it 's desider , but not how to take it .
It doesn 't have a piece of paper , not has a math , not has a recording .
So he begins to hear this kind of old anxiety grow in him like , " I 'm going to lose , and I 'm going to lose , and I 'm going to get to the song lost .
I 'm not good enough and I can 't do . "
And instead of going to go in the panic , they stopped .
I 'm going to do the entire process and he made something completely new .
And I just look at the sky and said , " Scuses , don 't see that I 'm driving ? "
" It seems to be writing a song hour ?
If you really want to be back in a more opports when I can take care of you .
Otherwise , I walked to do somebody else today .
You 're going to disturban Leonard Cohen . "
And his workers worked changed after this .
I don 't work , the job was still as always .
But the process , and the fish that was required when the genius was required when the genius , the genius , the genius that was going to be , and he remainly remaining it from that it was , by remained that he had to be interior .
but it 's gone , this is a peculiar , wonderful bizarre , a conversation between Tom and this strange thing that 's not Tom .
So what I felt that story started changing a little bit of the way I worked , and I was going to save me once .
This idea , I was walked when I was writing " Manogy , Prega , Ama , and I cadds in one of those cave disperation where we 're all working on something and we can 't be able to think that 's going to be a disaster , which is going to be disaster , which that 's going to be written .
Not just , just just the worst written , right ?
And I started to think about gectacking this project .
But then I remember Tom that I was talking about the air and I tried us .
So I got my face in the manubuts and I 've been my commments to a vacuum of the room .
And I said to high , " Seep , what do we know , if this book not will be brilliant not be interested in not be all my , right ?
Because as you see I 'm putting all I have , I don 't have more than that .
So if you want to be better , you have to give you you you and do your part .
OK . But if you don 't do it , I don 't do it .
I 'm going to write about the same because it 's my work .
And I would like to do that , I 'd like to be a lot of my part of doing my part . " Because , finally , it 's so , OK -- in the end of North people were raded for the midddances to the midddgathering of the midddamages and music that were going to go on for hours and hours .
And they were always magnific , because the balleras professionals were , and they were great .
But every once , something happened was , and one of these artists was actually transendent .
And I know you know what I 'm talking about , because I know you 've all seen , at a certain point , a performance like .
It was like the time stopped , and the dancerin walked through a kind of brought and not doing anything different from the Sun , like 1,000 nights before , but all you were sitting .
And suddenly , not appeared as a human .
But you accurate from the divinside and the fire in the fire of divinity .
And when this was happened , at the time , the people knew what was , they call it with his name .
They were saying the hands and started to cantar , " Allah , Allah , Allah , God , God , God . "
That 's God , you know .
Curious known -- when the More invading the South of South , took this abitude with them and the pronounds changed in the coli of " Allah , Allah , Allah , Allah , Allah , " who , " which you can still hear in the round the round of .
In Spain , when an article has done something impossible and magic , " Allah , " Buy , " Buills , " ununderstandable , " incomprehensible , " incomprehension-, " -- a God of God .
And it 's great because we need it .
But , the problem is the day after , for the dancing dancing the dancing of the day , when you wake up and discover that they are 11 morning of Martedyes and the God of God .
It 's just a mortal with a wallows of winooka , and maybe never never to get more to that altitude .
And maybe nobody will slow the name of God , and what 's going to do with his life ?
It 's hard .
This is one of the most painful recognizations to do in a creative life .
But maybe it doesn 't have to be so angotic if you can 't believe , in fact , if you can 't believe , the most extraordinary aspects of your being from you are coming from yourself .
But it just created that you would just be a source of this squisite of this squisite part of your life that you have to have to get to somebody else when you finished .
And , you know , if we think it 's this way .
And so I started to think , and it 's certainly like this , I thought for fun in the book that I thought , in the work of the book that I would publishing , I spent , I 'm going to do extent , I was going to do it , I was going to do it ,
And what I have to continue to tell me when I feel elected elected by this is , not afraid .
Don 't get it . It 's just your work .
Continua presentation , any way , any way , you can be .
If you work is to dance , balance .
If the divine , absurd genius to make decide to leave some kind of wonder , for one moment through your effort , for just a moment through your effort , then , "
Otherwise , you do the same dance .
And " Ole ! " "
I think , and I think , and I think it 's going to teach it .
" On it , " at yourself , even for the human love and heads and testardaggin tals to make you continental .
Thank you .
Thank you .
June Cohen : Ole !
And as you know , I 've talked about some of these projects on the human genome , what can mean , and what 's discovery of genes .
We 're starting a new path : We started to digitalize biology and now we 're going to digital biology , we 're entering a new phase of biology , designing and proving and synthetizing life .
We 've always been trying to get big questions .
" What is life ? " It 's something that many biologists , I think they 've been trying to figure out out of snail .
We tried different approaches , reduced to the terms .
We 're digitalizing from almost 20 years .
When we sequenced the human genome was treated to move from the analogical world of the computer world .
We 're going to ask us : we can regenerate life , or new from this digital universe ?
This is the map of a small organism , Mycoplasma genitalium , which is the smallest genitalium that can autorean .
And we tried to reduce the genome of the genome to create one more smaller .
We can eliminate a hundred genes of the 100-year-old genes of the way .
But when we look at his map map , it 's relatively simple respect to our .
I think , this is simple .
But when we look at all the genes that we can eliminate , one at the time , is very unlikely that this can bring a living cells .
So we decided that the only way to provided that the only way to provide this cromosome of the things that we could get modify components to bring some of these fundamental questions .
And so we started the adventure of " We can synthetize a cromosome ? "
It can be able to produce these big molecules that we never could produce these big molecules that we never have to create before we do that ?
And , in case , can we have a cromosome of chromosome ?
A cromosome is simply a chromosome of chemical material .
The speaker that we can digitalize life is growing at life is growing at exponential .
We 're able to write the genetic code , instead , instead , rather , but it 's improving .
And our most recent results that they take it on a exponential curve .
We started over 15 years ago .
The process require , a lot of pasages , beginning with a bioetic review before we started the first experiments .
But we found that DNA is very hard .
There are tens of thousands of cars in the world that produce small segments of DNA , of the longer of 30 to 50 lets and it 's a degenerative process : the longer segment is , the more errors .
So we had to develop a new method to assemble these fragments and correct the mistakes .
And this was our first attempt , to start digital information , to start digital information of the Phi genome of Phi 174 .
It 's a little virus that kills .
We designed the fragments , effected the correction of errors and get a molecule of DNA , about 5,000 letters .
The interesting part is when we took this piece of chemical material , and we 've put it into the bacteria , and we 've got it into the bacteria , the bacteria have started reading this genetic code and product particles .
The viral particles were releft by the cells , are back , and they 're back and destroyed the E. coli .
I 've talked about recently with membrals of the oil industry oil industry , which they 've certainly compress that they 've certainly compress .
They 've got more than you .
We believe that this is a situation where the software can actually build his own hardware in a biological system .
But we wanted to do things in big .
We wanted to build the entire cromosome of the bacteria .
I 'm more than 580,000 lets lets .
So we thought we 'd build it in the cassed of the size of the virus , so we could change the cases to figure out what the components of a living cells .
The design is crucial , and if we start with digital information in a computer , these are to be very accurate .
When we sequency this genome for the first time in 1995 , accurately was a mile for every 10 miles .
We found , resequency , 30 errors . If we had that original sequence . If we had that original sequence , we would never be able to do it .
One part of the process is designing long segments that are in 50 lets that they are survey with all the other segments of 50 letters to build the smaller segments that works together .
We try to give them the only here .
You probably have a bed that we put on the physical fire .
Think about that : we have a genetic code on four letters : A , C , G and To and To .
Three of those reading together code about 20 frightens , and there 's a specific order to the reading of all amminoacid .
So we can use the genetic code to write words , frures , fraction , thoughts , thoughts , thoughts , thoughts , thoughts , thoughts , thoughts , thoughts , thoughts , thoughts , thoughts , thoughts , thoughts , thoughts , thought-thought-thought-thought-thought-though
What we did was self-rather .
Some were of the fact that it wasn 't poetry .
We designed these segments to just just to join them .
There are enjoyed them and put them assimed them .
And we started assemble to assemble parts , beginning with segments five to segments , under five to segments , so we 've got 24 mile letter to get to get 72 miles .
We 've made these in abundance , so we 've made these in abundance so that we 're trying to create a very very robstood process -- like you 'll see in a minute .
We 're trying to automatizing the process .
So , this looks like the tabellon a basket .
When we get to these very long segments , more than 100 miles , more than 100 miles , they 're not going to grow more directly in the East .
It 's coming to the modern instruments of molecular biology .
So we 've been considered mechanisms .
We had another mechanism called recombination , which in biology , which is used to repair the DNA can une the DNA can une the segment .
Here 's an example .
This organism , called Deinococcus radiococcus , it can absorbed three million rad rad rads .
You can see in the super requarters as his chromosome is destroyed .
In 12 -- 24 hours is reassembled exactly like it was before .
There 's thousands of organisms that are able to do it .
These organisms can be completely .
They can live under a vacuum .
I 'm absolutely certainly that life exists in space , and you 're going to find new water rich environments of water .
In fact , NASA showed that this happens .
This is a picture of the molecule that we 've built with these processes , simply by using the long-insert design appropriate .
The yeast assemble them , it 's a huge .
This image was not taken with a microscope , but with a microscope , but with a microscope to regular .
It 's a molecule that we can see it with a microscope .
These are pictures that cover a period of about six seconds .
This is the publication that we 've done a few time ago .
I 'm more than 580,000 lets of genetic code .
It 's the biggest molecule of a defined structure that we 've ever had .
It 's got a multiple high 300 million .
If we were in the middle with a 10 without spaces , it would like 142 pages , we would just like 142 pages , it would like 142 pages .
Now , how do we do that ? How can we activate it ?
Of course , you love a virus is a game .
It 's a little more complicated when you use the bacteria are using bacteria .
It 's easier when it 's tracks like our ekars : you can just extract the nucleus and put it on another , which is basically the clonation process .
In the bacteria cromosome is instead of integrated inside the cell , but we 've recently demonstrated that we can do a bought of a bought of a bought of a cell to another and activity .
We can get a cromosome from a microbial species .
The two are how the men are as different men .
We 've added some gene that we could decide what choose to choose for this chromosome .
And then the skip with the ends in way to kill all the proteins .
And when we put it in the cell was stupended -- and we 're appreciate our sophisticatoos -- the new cromosome of cromosome .
And we were thinking that we couldn 't go beyond , but we 've tried to spend more in there .
This is one of the major mechanisms of evolution .
We found that many species have added species have added a second or a third , in a second or a third thousands of new tracks to that species .
So who think evolution is not the gene at the time that you can 't have a lot of the biology of the modies .
There 's enzyme called restription that advantage of restription that they can digm DNA .
The cromosome that was in the cells not possibly one .
The cell phone , the cromosome that we 've put it .
It 's expressed , and he recognized the other chromosome as material material , has the masticated , and we were rhythic with only and the new cromosome .
It became blue because of the genes that we 've been put .
And in a short lass of time , all the characteristics of a species are going to go on a new species , based on the new species , based on the new species , based on the new software that we put in the cells .
All proteins are changed , the members are changed , and when we read the equivalent of what we 've been transfer to what we 've done .
Now , this could seem alchemilarity , but altering the software DNA . We can change things in the way enough .
Now , I 've already explained that here you don 't talk about the genesis -- but we 've been progress to go from three and a half million years of evolution , and I said that maybe we 're going to create new species on this digital process .
Why do that ?
I think that 's obvious when we think about our needs .
We 're going to go from six and a half billion people at nine billion in the next 40 years .
Right for example : I was born in 1946 .
Now there are three people on the planet for each existing in 1946 ; in 40 years , there will be four .
We 're having problems now to find food , fresh water and clean , and walking , and walking , and walks for six billion people .
It will be more detecting to do it for nine billion .
We use more than five billion coal , more than 30 billion bets , more than 30 billion bets of oil .
That means millions of bucks a day .
When we try to find biological processes , or any kind of process , or any kind of process to reduce them , it 's going to be huge .
We have to keep all the hemition of CO2 from these materials that finds in the atmosphere .
At day , because of the scientific discoveries around the world , we have a database of genes , and I like to think they are designed for the future .
The electronics industry just , and you think about how different things , and think about how many different things came out of it .
Our limits here is basically by biological reality , and our imagination .
We have now , because we have these rapid metods of synthesization , we can create what we call combatory genomics combatory .
We can build a big robot that can produce a big robot that can produce a million hard hard hard .
Think about this 20 million genes or different genes or to try to get the processes to produce either optimize or drugs , and we can change , because of a little team , and we can change , because of a little team , and to create more biology that in the last 20 years of science .
And it 's just a standard selection .
We can choose for the chance of survival , chemical production , chemical production , chemical production , etc .
This is an instantaneous instantaneous of some software programmed that we 're working on for being able to seat and design species to the computer .
Well , we don 't necessarily know how they 're going to be .
We know exactly what they are genetic code .
We 're now concentrating on the fuel fuel fuel .
You also saw you who are ethanol from the grate was a finite experiment .
We have fuels of second-generation , and third generation that will be used enough of the higher value of the higher value , like the opten or different types .
But the only way that biology can have a big impact without increase without increase the cost of food and limited the cost of food and limited the avity of the cost of food , so we 're working on to design cells that can be transform this purpose , and we think we could have this purpose that can be in the first generation in about 18 months .
The light solar light with the CO2 is a metodownstroke -- but in our discoveries around the world , we found different metods .
This is an organism that we have described in 1996 .
It lives in the deep ocean , about 2500 feet of deep the temperature of the water .
They 're metane from CO2 , using multiple hydrogen , like ,
We 're trying to figure out if we can figure out CO2 , which can be easily be transported by the CO2 in fuel , to drive that CO2 in , to drive this process .
So , we think that we could be able to increase what we can do is what the basis of life . " And we have the basic question , " which is , we have the goal of -- we have the goal of reduce the entire industry .
Exactly . If you can 't do it from TED , where can you ?
It would be a main source of energy .
And we 're working for using the same metods to create vaccines .
You 've seen this year with the influence , we 're always back of a year and with a dollar in less when it 's what it is to find the wind vaccine .
I think that that 's going to change by combines .
Here 's how the future could start to look at changing , now , the tree of evolution , accelerating the evolution with synthetic bacteria , archy , and finally , and finally , and finally , and inherently , and infinally , and inherently , and then finally , and then , and in the very hard , and then , and then , and then , and then , and then finally , the evolution of the evolution of the evolution of changes , and it could be changing ,
We 're so so that we 're going to be like the best people .
Our purpose is to do so long enough to try to do it . Thank you very much . Thank you very much .
First of all to show you , the most rapidly possible , some fundamental work , some fundamental work , the new technology that we 've taken to the Microsoft in a year ago . This is Seadragon .
It 's a environment where you can interact is to local level that remote with a huge amount of data .
We 're seeing a lot of digital gigabyte photos with a kind of zoom , and continuous , for a panoramic speed , disponing , disponing the images like we want .
And it doesn 't matter how big amount of information that we see , how big these things are raised or the data or the images .
Most of them are common photographs , but this is a scan from the Bioowners of the Congress , and reaching in the gamma of 300 megaxel .
It doesn 't make any difference because the only thing that limits the prestations of a system like this is the number of pixel on your screen on the screen in your screen .
This is a whole book , example of not data , not images .
This is the Dickens of Dickens . Every colonful is a chapter .
And to show you that 's about textbooks , and not images , we can do something like that , to make a real representation of the text , not a photos .
It could be a little artificial way to read a book .
It 's not the advice .
This is an example more realistic . It 's an exactly a number of The Guardian .
Every picture is the beginning of a section .
And it really gives you the pleasure and the beautiful experience of paper , or a quote , which is for nature or a quotidian , which is for nature a lot .
We also did something with the corner of this particular number of The Guardian .
We 've created a higher advertising advertising -- much more than what you use in a normal advertising -- and we 've been insered you of the extra content .
If you want to see the characteristics of this automobile , you can see them here .
Or other models , or even the specific techniques .
And this really shows some of these ideas to eliminate the limits of space on the screen .
We hope that that means to put up to the few and other porks and other porks like the similar porcheries , not to be necessary .
Of course , the maping is one of the most obvious applications for this type of technology .
And I don 't want to lose time , if not say that we have contributes to get in this field .
These are all the streets in the United States . It 's a geothern image on the NASA waitch .
So we 're going to go to something else .
This is now actually , by the way , you can go to the web ; you can see it .
It 's a project called Photosynth , which combine two different technologies .
One is Seadragon , and the other is a visual research at the other interesting computer , made by Noah Snavority , a student of Washington , with Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Szelith-UW .
And it 's from Seb , gestite by Seadragon .
You can see that when we do this kind of screen , where we can go from an image to the other and have this kind of exactly experience .
But the space of the images here has actually actually a meaning .
The algorithms of visualization of computers have recorded these images together , so that correspond to the real place in which the image -- all of the images that are taken up with the Montagne Roccious Roccious , and they 've been taken . So you see elements of the elements of a slagne , and these things were all the space .
I don 't know if I 've time to show you some other environment .
There are some more space .
I want to go directly to one of the original data set set of Noahs -- and this is from a previous prototype of Photosynthrow -- to show what we 've done for the first time the express of this technology , the Photosynth . And that 's not necessarily evident . It 's not necessarily evident .
We had to worry about the legal aspects and so on .
This is a reconstruction of the Notre catthedral Dame . In the Flickr , you 're going to digitar . Baast , and you get images of the other campairy , other campus , other campus and so on . So , one of these arancions is discovery that it 's discovery .
So they 're all pictures from Flickr , and they were all colleaged to the space level in this way .
And it 's possible to navigate this way simple .
You know , I would never have thought I would never have thought to go to Microsoft .
It 's very gratifying to get this kind of accohy here .
I think you can see that it 's a lot of different types of different types of phones to the phones of those SLR professional , a number of meaning , SLR , a number meaning , put together in this environment .
And if I can try to look for those strange .
Many are block , etc .
And somewhere here 's a series of photograph -- here it 's a series of photograph -- here .
This is a Notre poster Dame recorded correctly .
We can move from the poster to the physics of this environment .
The essential point is that we can do things with social environment . This now is taking data from the entire memory -- from the entire memory of the vision of visual -- and you 're all those data together .
All those pictures become colleaged together , more than the som of the parts .
You 've got a model of the land that emerges .
Think about this as the Stephen Lawler 's work on the War 's work on Earth .
It 's something that grows in complexity as people are using it , and the people who are using it , and the advantages for the use of the use .
Their pictures are hamed with the other people .
If somebody 's idea of the idea of meet these sants , my name pictures of Notre , my picture of Notre catthemselves , and I can use it as a whole spot of all the data , and I can use it as a meet of engineer to immergering me in that metaphor , in that metaph-moed social experience of cle-moed red experience .
Of course , a consequence of all that are virtual model of every interesting pattern , collected by all the interesting patterns , collected not just the plane of all the way from satellite images and similar images , but from the collective memory .
Thank you very much .
Chris Anderson : I 've got good ? What your software going to be able to do is that at a point in the next few years , all the photograph of everyone in the entire world will be basically collected together ?
BAA : Yeah . What 's doing is basically discover .
It 's creating hyperlink , if you want , among images .
And it 's doing it in the content of the images .
The thing becomes very interesting if you think about the require semantic information that 's semantic information that 's a lot of these images that many images .
As when you do a picture of images on the Web , you digits a sentence and the text on the web page has a lot of information about the images .
Now , what if that pictures are connecting to all your pictures ?
So the amount of interconnection and the amount of wealth and the amount of rich require that is really huge . It 's a classic effect of the network .
CA : Blaise , it 's really amazing .
BAA : I thank you very much .
One of the main pile-to-by-to-by-to-by-forgo-born pleasure is the power of living between who has not forget the anti-traditions , the past in the wind , the touches in the wind , the touch of rain , driving plants .
And I think that sciamounts Jaguar traveling beyond the Via Lattea , or that the mitites are still helped to me , or that in Himalayas , the buddies still , to remember the respecting of the midddle of the Dharm , to remember the world the importance that we live in not exist in sense , but it 's just a model of reality ,
the consequence of a particular set set set of adaptations that our stroke has done , well or a lot of generations ago .
And , of course , we all share of the essential tracts .
All of them . All protecting .
We are subjects of the initiation .
We have to deal with the inesorability of death , so we don 't surprise and we 're sitting , and we don 't like , and we 're going to be like , and we don 't have to be surprise , and so we don 't have to be surprise , so we have to be surprise and the inexorability of death , so we don 't surprise to the inesorability , so we don 't surprise to the inexorability of death , so we have to death the inexorability of death , so we have to death .
We all have an art .
What hits is the particular rhythm of the song , the rhythm of every culture .
It doesn 't matter that they are the Penan forests of the Borneo , or the following of the Haiti , or the Haiti 's desert Kaisut in Kenya Sctourished , or a cammmmouth , or a cammmmmouth in the heart of the Sahara .
He was my companion of journey in the desert a month ago , or a yak at the gap of the Qomoll , on the Everest , the mother of the world .
All these populations teaching us that there are other ways of existing other ways of thinking , other ways of modes of modes , other ways of moving in the world .
And , if you think , it 's a concept that can give you hope .
And together , my cultures of cultures of the world cultures of the world , cultural life that has been cultural and cultural that we wanted to be the planet and it 's important for the planet as the ragnature as a biological ragnature as biosphere .
And you can think about this cultural ragnature as a hetnos-in ethnos-free , and you can define the total ethnosh , dreams , intuitions , intuitions , intuitions , intuitions , brought up to be the human imagination .
The ethnosphere is the patrimonia of human .
It 's the symble of what we are and what we can be in how much species .
And because the biosphere was a lot of biosphere was very quickly , in the etno.S. .
No biologist , for example , it would say that 50 percent of all species was on the hort of the extinction simply because it 's false , or -- in the most apocalypocalypocalypocaltic -- and you don 't even even even the pocalypocket -- that of the cultural diversity .
The index of all that is , of course , the language .
When you 're born 6,000 languages on this planet .
A language is not just by a vocabulary or a series of rules or rules .
A language is the middle of human spirit .
It 's the middle of which the animal of every culture is in the material world .
Every language is a forest of mind , a bacin mind , a thought , a spiritual chance .
And those 6,000 languages , as we 're here sitting in Monterey , at least half of the kids .
They don 't get more teached to kids , which means , unless you won 't wild something , which are already dead .
What 's more sad than being able to be the silence , of being the last to talk to a language , not so so that we can do the wisdom of being the sages of the promise or advance ?
This remember was the state of someone in the world every two weeks : every two weeks : every two weeks , one 's a moving , and it 's die with the last syllabes of a ancillabe .
And I know somebody who will say , " Don 't it ?
The world wouldn 't be a better place if we talk about all the same language ? " Bensim , then we talk to all yorba . We talk about the canton .
We talk about kogs .
You 'll cover a traction of what it means not to talk about their language .
I 'd like to do you a journey through the ethnosal --
a little journey in the ethnos-putting journey of what we 're losing .
Many of us forget that when I say , " different ways of existing really different ways of existing .
We take for example , this Barasana , in Amazon , in Amazon , the popular saces , which crees the meast , who crees to come from the latte of the sacred sacred sacred of the sacred sacred sacred sacred .
It 's a popular that 's not able to distinguish the blue that 's green because the time , the celests is identified in the time of the forest , which depends the popular .
They have a strange language and a matrimonic rule , detecting a very strong language . "
All of this radical in the past past , yet the particularity is that in these extent families that are talking about six or seven language .
They 're limited to listen to listen and then start talking .
We take one of the most interesting tribes that I lived , the Waoran Ecuador , a popular that 's been the first contacts in 1958 .
In 1957 , they 've been trying to a commodities .
They 've done by the photographs that were in a few people who were in a few who had adichevolved , forget that this popular popular forests .
They 've been collected the photos , they 've been putting the research , and , not found nothing that it was treated that it was a diavy , and they 've killed the five missioning with the lance .
But the Waoran not killed the strangers .
They killed in their own .
Fify percent of mortality was caused by themselves .
We 're risalites at eight generations and we found two cases of natural death and when we were involved to know , they 've been invited so that one of them was invited so that he was invited so that he died , and then they killed it the same .
The crawers were able to recognize the urine animal from 40 steps and recognize the species .
In the early 1980s , I was assigned a very interesting task when I was asked a very interesting task , if I wanted to go to Harvard me if I wanted to go to Haiti me in the base society of Duvalier and Tonton Macoutes , and impossessing in the first 1980 , and impossessing me of the speed .
To give me a sense to miraculous , I would have to understand the Vodoudoubs and that the Vodouldn 't be magnine .
It 's pretty much of a complex metaphysics of the world .
Very interesting .
If I asked you to tell me the big religions of the world , what would you say ?
Cristianesimum , Islam , Buddism , Ebraism , etc .
A continent is always left out , thinking that the sub-Saharan Africa has not been religious . And instead of these religious concepts . And the Vodoo is not that the distillate of these religious concepts that we have a lot of profound nate tragic concepts of these religious concepts .
What makes the interesting voodoo is the relationship between life and death .
So the way you live the spirits .
The spirits can be invocated by the Great Acqua , resployed to the rhythm of the way that you can see the rhym of the way that for a short across the way .
So , that 's why you love to say , " You know white , " You can go to ask God .
We say in the temple and diventire , we say God . "
And from the moment that you are , is the spirit that you are , how can you do the evil ?
So you 're at these amazing : following voodoo in the state of trance that touching impunes , a rather strongly demonstration of the power when it 's catalyzed in a state of extreme , when it 's cataled in a state of extreme extreme extreme extreme extreme , in the state of the power of the mind , when it 's cataling in the state of the power when it 's cataling in the body that 's catalures .
In all the popular people with which I lived the most extraordinary are the Kogi of Sierra Nevada , Santa Marta , in the Colombia sector .
Eventures of the ancivilization that once living on the plane of Colombia in the farming of the Colombia in the waiting population , the population of the vulcanic civilic plasy that you erge on the planture .
In a blood , this popular continent , this popular was never conquered by the spages .
It 's now government by a clero , but their formation is very extraordinary .
The young people are brought out of the families to three or four , and they live secreated in a world done of good sheep and shadown-hand-on the backyoung for 18 years .
Two high periods of years choices to reproduce the nine months of gestation that translate in the user of the mother , now are metaphorically in the user of the Great Mmother .
So , so , that 's acculturated to the values of their society , values that they predicted their predicted , and just their predicted predict , and just their predict , or to say the balance .
At the term of this incredible initiation , they 're improvisely taken out and for the first time in the age of 18 , they see an alba . And in that account of the first clands , when the sun background vals , everything that they learned in the beautiful valley , everything they learned in theory . The precise is to the back of the behind , and it says ,
" I 'm going to do you . "
It 's amazing . Now it 's to you protect it . "
They 're call the most of the major brothers and say that we , brothers , we are the colpatures of the world .
This level is intuition is extremely important .
When we think about indeed populations in the environment , we think the Resau and the old story of the noble story , which is a razy razy in his simplicity or maybe we 're test that these popular population are closer to us .
The indeed popular people are not feeling from the nostalogy .
There 's no space for these things in the disease of malaria in the Astststat or the gelids of the Tibet , but because of the time and the rhythic , they 've created a mistic war , but on an unknowledge , but on a bunch of neighbors : the concept that the Earth can only live because it 's infection .
What does that mean ?
It 's going to say that a kid of Ande that grow is a mess of Ande that mountain is a spirit Apu that will be a human deep . And it will have a very different relationship of the mountain , and it 's going to have a very different relationship to a Montana , which is a male of Montana that 's going to grow that a mountain of Montana .
which is the hour of a spirit or a mineral craft is irright-irrise .
What 's interesting is the metaphor that defines the measure of the individual and the natural world .
I grew up in the forests of the British Columbia British Columbia British to be cutting .
And that made me a human being from my Kwakiutl that people who believe that the forests are the forests of Hukuk and the short of the paradise and the dog downbals that live to the extreme extreme , spirits that live in the extreme , spirits that live in the early Hamator .
If you start to look at that these cultures can create different reality , you can start to understand some of their sensational discoveries . We make this plane .
I 've taken this picture to open in the northerdoccils .
Maybe some of you 've heard about the ayahuash , the most powerful psychoected such of the sciamanic repertoire .
What makes the ayahuasingly the ayahuash is not the physical potential of the sustained , but its elaboration . It 's two .
In a hand , this leaving lining a series of character , which is a series of cheap , harmine , slightly hallucinogeny .
I take the only plant , you have a blue that you have a blue that alters a little bit of consciousness , but it 's miscreen with the leaf of the Psychotria .
This plant contains powerful triptamine , very similar to the serotonin , methoxyltryltryltryltryltryptaminine .
If you 're ever going to see Yanomami , you 'll see the nass that make from a different set of species , ancher contains methoxyltryltryltryltryltryltrylessine .
And so , to be that polls on the nose is like being disappeared by a fire pinches and land on a bunch of pinches and land on a mare of electricity .
I had often I had my professor , Richard Evan Shultes , the man who 's taken the man who 's taken the psychedeliver in the ' 30s in Mexico .
I 'm not going to be able to be . And I can 't be to be able these tripams like because if you 're not going to tell one of being hallucinated . And I said , you can 't tell you . Can ] [ [ [ Two ] triptamines can 't be ran in the outside that 's intestine , because they are in the insummer , detection .
It 's possible to be absually if you 're just going to be assumption with other chemical chemicals that money the MAs .
Now it 's beautiful : The beta-carboline that are in this liana are ininjuana are ininjuana , the same kind of need to be able to be able to be tripsts . The question is spontaneous : in a 80,000 species of plants , how these popular popular sets , but if you combine , that 's such a version of 80,000 species that 's summer ?
We use the great euphy of proof and error , which can be revealing .
But if we ask the Indians , they will tell us , " The plants are talking about it . "
What does that mean ?
This tribes , the Cofan , has 17 variety of ayahuash , which are going to be in the forest , and that our eyes would be going to be reverse in the same species .
If we 're going to be putting their tasonomics tells us , " I thought I was thinking about plants , you don 't know everything ? " I said , " No .
The solution is : you get the 17 variety in a night of len and each other , and each other . It will be a different .
And that 's not a fluid at Harvard , but it 's much more interesting that to contate the stams .
Now , [ we ] the problem is that also is that those of us who have heart heart popular popular people who are pitting them , but somehow reduced to our real world , and it 's more .
In fact , the 20th century , in 300 years , not will be reminded for the wars or its innovation , but rather like the same innovation , but rather like the way we were stopped and we have abbractivally or passively accepted destruction of the biological diverity of biological diverity of the planet . Now , the problem is not change .
All cultures through the seccoli were involved in a dance for new chance of life .
And the problem is not technology .
The Indians have not been stopped to be Sioux when they put out of the ark and falls as Americans don 't stop being Americans when they put out of Americans , when they put out of the horse and calved .
It 's not the change or the technology that they minacross the integrity of the ethnosal .
The hard flight of the domination .
And if you look at the world , you 'll find that these are not cultures that these are not cultures are cultures .
They are living and dynamics are living and dynamics out of identific existence that go beyond their own ability to adaptation .
And what 's disbowling in the Patria of the Penan --
a popular nomake Sarak , in the Sarawak , in the asiats , a popular popular in the forest until one generation ago , and now reduced to the service , and now reduced to the rive refueled by the rive revered , where you can see the river of the west things that looks like the horizing middle Borneizing the horizing ,
It 's taking the stage with the wooowners .
Or , in the case of Yanomami , are the disease that are the disease come to the discovery of the gold .
If we 're going to move on the Tibet , where I 'm doing a lot of research , you 'll see the hard of political domination .
As you know the genocide , physics of a popular popular , is convicted to universal level , but the ethnocide , the destruction of a popular living , not just condition , but it 's not just condent , but it 's not just condent , but it 's a lot of development .
And you can 't understand the Tibet , until you can 't understand the Tibet .
I lost the 6,000 miles from China in the Western China through the Tibet South East , and by the way , by the way , and by Lhasa , but only got to Lhasa , I realized what we feel about .
6,000 monuments in sacred and holding .
1.2 million people killed by military military during the Cultural Revolution .
The father of this guy was ascritical at the Panchen Lama .
It means that it was killed to the time of Chinese invasion .
And in the uncle of the smoke , in the diaspora that has led the popular in Nepal .
His mother was impressed and his colpattern was being rich .
It was brought to hide in the age of two , born in the age of two , born under his leg because he could not live without him .
The sister , who did the same , was in the field of reeducation .
One day has been hot a day , a fashion Mao and , for this transgression , was mitted to the workers of the workers for seven years .
The Tibet can be insupply , but the reference of the popular , but the reference of the population is hard .
At the end , all of it reduces to a choice .
We want to live in the world monocromatical world or we want to account the polymate world , or we want to across the policymatic world ?
The great anthropologa Margaret Mead , before he said that his biggest was that his biggest scareas was , in our living toward this view of human imagination , not just see the entire gamm of human imagination , but one day we 'll see us from a sleep , but one day we 'll get from a sleep .
And it 's umiliating that our species is existed for 60,000 years .
The Neolitical revolution , who gave us the agriculture , which did have us absolutely to the cult of the seed , and replacing the poetry of the sler , creating the gerarchy of the specialization , and we talk about 10,000 years ago .
The modern industrialized world has been 300 years .
That 's history not suggests that we have the answers that we have the answers to all the challenges that we should do to be .
When these miric miric miric world is asked what it means to be human , they say , " human , " They say with 10,000 different voices .
And that 's in these answers that all risky the chance of being what we are : a consciously knowledge that has to make all the people and all the people and all the garden can traveling . And there are great moments of optimism .
I 've taken this picture on the northern extremity of the Baffin , when I went to the hunt hunt of the Balin , and this man , Olaya , Olaya , he tells me the wonderful story of his grandfather .
The government canady was not always gentlemen with the Inuit and in the 1950s to stabian , we 've rinchieved them in colonies .
The grandfather of this man refused to go .
The family , I teaching his life , and he took them all the arms , and all his attacks .
You have to know that Inuit doesn 't have the cold , the purchase , franker .
The batts were in origin were dealing were made of cartos .
The grandfather than this man didn 't intimise from the arctic night or the library that they were driving .
It 's gathered out , it 's calculate the pantalone in the skin and defected in their hand . When I did it . When I did it , they 've been congelate , they 've been doing it a lama .
It 's a spring on the door of this hit , and when it became solid , it 's killed a dog .
He brought the dog , and created a bridaughter , with the actic cass made a sleth-up , and it 's disappeared on the ball , and it 's disappeared on the balloon .
We want to talk about cavarsely with nothing ? [ Rism ] And that , in different ways , [ Applauses ] is the symbl of the Inuit of the resilience of the Inuit , and all the people in the world .
In the open , 1999 government , the canaunted government has given the total controls of a territory area of a territory area of the larger California and Texas together .
It 's their new patria . It 's called Nunavut .
It 's an independent territory . They 're all the minerary resources .
One splendidg example of how a nation-state can remember with his popular popular .
And , in finish , I think it 's pretty obvious . I think it 's quite obvious .
For someone is home .
They represent sections of human imagination that are treating at the high high high high high high flows , as the dreams of hope .
Finally , we 're in National Geographic , we are convinced that political will never get to nothing .
We believe that polemiics --
[ Applauses ] not are , but we believe that stories can change the world , and maybe we 're the best institution to tell the world , and maybe we 're the best institution to tell the world stories of the world . Every month , we have 35 million visites .
156 countries transmit our television canal .
Our revivists are literally long-millions of people .
Our work is traveling in the ethnosphere to get our audience in places of the amazing cultural anthrowed to get out of the way they 've seen , hopefully , they will be able to be revelation of the midddle of the anthropology : the world 's world 's world 's going to be in a middle of life in a world ,
where the wisdom of all the people can contribute to our collective well-being .
Thank you .
I 'm going to talk about some things I wrote in this book that I hope that you 've written , and I 'm going to try to get some connections , in the case not .
I want to start with what I call " the " official dogma . "
The official dogma of what ?
The official dogma of all society society of all society society , the official dogma : " If we want to do that is massimilar to do our citizens . "
The reason is , from a side , in the fact that freedom is in the same value , is , useful , useful , essential for humans .
And the other is that if we 're free , each of us can do everything that we can do for all that massimilar our well-being , not nobody that decided to our well-being , not nobody decided to our well-being .
The way to massize freedom is massimilar choice .
More choices , more choices , more are free , and more , is their freedom , the more than they are well-being .
This , I think , is so deeply radicated in society that nobody would have to put it in doubt .
And it 's also deeply radical in our lives .
I 'm going to show you some examples of what progress has rest possible .
This is my supermarket . It 's not particularly big .
I allowed a simple note on the conditiments .
In my supermarket , there are 175 conditions , without the 10 variety of oil and the 12 oil and 12 acetes and 12 acesage that you can buy for you a huge number of constantance in the circumstance that nobody of 175 , ready ready ready is to your degree .
Here 's what supermarket .
And then you go to the electronics to buy a stereo : CD , lector , lector CD , radio , pile , pile , plane ,
And in this single negotie in this single negotie , there 's a big number of components .
We can do six million and a half of different combinations using the components that there are in one negotie .
You need to admit that there 's a lot of choice .
Other camps : the world of communications .
Once , when I was a kid , they could get all the phone phone services , and they could be shape , and they could be forned by mama Bell .
It was doing the phone , he didn 't buy it .
A consequence of that , between the other , was that the telephone .
These days are gone .
We have a variety of telephones , especially amount of phones , especially among the cell phones .
Here 's the cell of the future .
My favorite is in the middle , MP3 , cutes of the nose , and the shape to the cyoung bone .
If you don 't even see it in the negotie in the home , you 're going to be able to be .
And what happens is that people enters are in the negozes and ago , and you know , what the answer is ? The answer is " No . "
It 's not possible to buy a cell that doesn 't do too much .
So , in other aspects of life that are much more important than the phidden plosion of choices .
Assistence health : it doesn 't happen in the United States that you go to the doctor and doctor , you have to say what to do .
Instead , I walked out , and doctor says , " OK , we can do A , or B , we can do A , or B , " By , " B , " B has these bells and these " B " B bells them . What do you ? "
You say , " Dottore , what would I do ? "
And the doctor says , " In the doctor says , and these risks , and B has these benefits and these risks . "
" What do you want ? "
And you can rebuts , " Dottore if she was me , what would you do ? "
And the doctor , " But I 'm not her . "
The result of the result of the maled , " that 's " self-deal , expression that it looks like a beautiful thing .
But it 's not that a move the weight and responsibility to make decisions that can make decisions that something knows , you know , to somebody else knows -- and almost of course , and it 's not in the ideal condition to make the patient decisions .
There 's a huge marketing products , direct people like me and you , and you , that if you think there 's no sense , because we can 't buy them .
But if we can 't buy them , why do they publishing them ?
The answer is that they want to doctor , we call the doctor for ask them to change the recipe .
Some of the fundamental as our identity is a question of choice , how you see in this vision , how you see in this vision . " We don 't want to force the kids . We don 't want to be a hard time . " We don 't want to get the right time . " We have to invent .
And we can reinventing how many times we do it .
That means that every morning , at the morning , at the answer , you have to be .
I reach the family and marriage , a time , a time , a common time , under the perspective , almost for anybody , was that he was that you can switch the most possible .
The only real choice was with who , not when , and not not when , and not even what to do .
And that 's really going to play .
I teach very smart students , and I do 20 percent of work , at less than a time .
And not because they 're not because they 're not because they 're not because they 're not because they 're not very brilligent .
but why are they impensierited , I 'm going to ask , " I should wish or not ? I should do that right now ? "
" I should say , " I should have be later ? I have to think before the children or the career ? "
I 'm interrogoring .
And they 're trying to answer these questions , even though this implemented not completely the tasks that absolutely section to my own own own exactly .
And they really have to do it . They are important questions .
Now , the job : we 're lucky , as Carl , because the technology allows us to work every minute , every day , every day , from the Hotel Randoll .
In the parently , there 's a corner , and I 'm not going to tell you that , where the WiFi works .
I don 't tell you , because I want to use it .
What does , this incredible freedom of choice that we have about work ? It 's that we have to keep , continually in every moment , if we have to work or not .
We can go to see our child play , and we can heat , with the cell phone in a tax , Blackberry , the other , and the notetebook , and the notetetebook , and the narrator .
And even though they are , every minute that we see our child , we see our child , we 're also asking , " Do answer this called ? "
" I have to answer this email ? I have to habboze this letter ? "
And when the answer is no , " all this makes the experience of your child very different than you 've been in other conditions .
So , from any part of the little bit of , little bit , and big things , materials and life , life is a question of choices .
Once the world was this : Obuts , there were some possibility , but not all was a choice .
The world today is it looks like this : The dilemma is , " Is it a good thing , or negative ? "
The answer is , it 's Should you be .
The positive sung them , so I 'm going to talk about the negative ones .
All this choice is two negative effects of the people .
The first , paradoxally , is that it 's paralysis that it 's paralysis that it 's paralysis that it 's paradoxed that liberation .
With options in which choose choose to choose , it 's very difficult to do it .
I offer you a meaning : a conducted plans of volunteer ,
A colleague has had access to the data of Vanguard , the gigantic society , with about a million clients in the source of the fundamental entered in 2,000 different companies .
What she discovered is that for every 10 solutions that are offered in more , the percentage of two .
With 50 funds , there 's 10 percent ads , in less than when they are available to when they are available . Why ?
Because with 50 funds in which choose , is maledly difficult to decide , and the choice is remainly difficult to the inequal .
And I 'm still going to ask , questions , questions , and I 'm really never get .
You know , it doesn 't mean that these workers are going to mangering food for cans because they 're not going to be enough money , it also want to say that the decision is that they lose the funds is so hath the funds of the complementary the funds of the labor dator .
It 's not participating , they 're lost to five dollars in the day , which would be so much as well as a year , which would be so much disposed to be .
So the paralysis a consequence of having too many choices .
And I think it makes the world like this .
" And finally , " " " " " As , " ketchup , feaks or maionese ? "
You want to take the decision , if it 's for ethernity , if it 's for ethernity , right ?
You don 't want to choose the source , and even the wrong condition .
So this is the first effect . The second is that we can avoid paralysis , and we 're going to do a choice , at the end of how we would be able we have been with less options of what we would choose .
And that 's why for different reasons .
One of these is that with many conditions in which you choose , if you buy one and it 's not perfect , it 's easy to imagine that you could do a different choice that would be better . And what 's what happens is that the alternative imagined us industry , and the retied rement to the squirt , and the recovered the decision ,
And when it was a very good decision .
More choices are , more , it 's easier , more than any detail than any detail that 's insod-ceasy of choice .
And there is what economists call constitness .
Dan Gilbert really well stamateur , very well as the value we can see things that we 're going to do .
In the rest , when there are a lot of options , it 's easy to be able to be the alternative characters , and be less satisfacts of the option that you are choice .
Here 's an example . I school with all those who are not New York .
But that 's what you probably think .
There 's this copy to the Hamptons .
A place of luser .
It 's bears . Oten a day . It 's all about them .
Nothing . But what he thinks is , " Well , malth , it 's August . "
" All my neighbors at Manhattan is . "
" I could talk about front of home . "
And it 's pass two weeks of the idea that 's losing -- every day -- the chance of parking -- every day -- the chance of parking , where it wants .
The constood opportunity is decreases for what we , even when the choice was excellent .
And more than the options that we have to consider , the more the characteristics acting that are going back to us as constantly as the constantly opportunity .
Here 's another example .
This vignet us a lot of things .
It 's about living the moment , and maybe slowly .
But the most important point is that anything you choose , you 're choose to do them .
The things that we don 't choose are so many attractive attractive what we do .
I third point : : Which growing the expectations .
I tried it on my skin beating a new jeans .
I 'm almost always jeans .
And once the jeans were just a guy , buy them and bits and besty from the besty , they were moved , just after having them a lot and worked , they were moved to go well .
So , I went to buy a new when the old ones were went , and I said , " I said , " I need a couple of jeans , this is my cutting tenty . "
The commit said , " He wants to me , " Hunglim , fit ? "
He wants to the certain or with the bottons ? " Stonewashed , " or " across ? "
" Do you want them to be bad ? "
" Sott them want to be honey ? Buddball , " Buddge ball .
I was sad , and after a little bit after a little bit I could say , " I want the guy that was the only like , " I want the guy , " I want to all of the jeans , and then I went out of the jeans , I went out of the best jeans that I had ever had .
It was the massize . I had to get the best .
But I felt that .
Why ? I wrote a book to figure that .
The reason I was going to be perfectly worst is that with all that choice , the jeans had to be perfected .
I was waiting , I waiting . I didn 't expect anything exceptional when there was only a kind of a kind of , but when it was a different kind of had to be perfect .
What I was bought , but not perfect .
And after I was compared to what I was trying to do with what I was trying to do in comparison the expectations .
The addition of options in the life of people do not doing the expective aspective that these are respect to the options of the same .
And this will produce less so-disfree , even when the results are good .
Nobody in the world of marketing in the world .
Because if they knew , you wouldn 't know what I 'm talking about .
The truth more about this .
" It was better when he was worse , " The reason why he was going to be better when he was worse was that when he was worse was going to be able to meet .
And in the world that we live in -- opulents , opulents , industrialized citizens with the expectancy of perpection -- the massize that we can hope is that things are at the height .
You never have surprised to be surprised because your expectations , my aspectations are ingigantic .
The secret of happiness -- what you 're here -- is , " Basse , " Yeah , " Yeah , you want . "
I mean -- small authobiographic moment -- which I 'm really married and my wife is really amazing .
I could not do , I didn 't have to do , I don 't have to do .
But it 's not always a bad thing .
And finally , a consequence of the pair a couple of jeans when there 's only that when you 're not satisfied , and you say , " Why ? "
" Who is responsible ? " " " The answer is clear .
The world is responsible . What can I do ?
When there are hundreds of jeans , and you buy a pattern , and you 're ask you who 's responsible , and you ask you who 's responsible , is that the responsible responsible you .
You 'd do better .
With hundreds of available , there are no scale .
So when people are making decisions , even though the result is walked , they 're going to be in , and they give the high to them .
In the last few years , depression is expression in the last years ,
I think a meaning , not the only , but the only , but important -- of this is that the depression of the depression is that people are existence because the standards are too high .
And when they have to explain this situation think that the colors is they think that colcolors is .
So the final result is that we 're in general , we 're better , but we feel worse .
Let me reminds you .
This is the official dogma , what we all take for good and it 's completely fake . It 's not true .
There 's no doubt that a little bit of choice is better than having not at all , but but from this is not at a little choice .
There 's a critical value , I don 't know what it is .
But I 'm sure that we 've been on a piece of the level where the choices are improve our life .
Now , from political view -- I 've almost finished -- from political point of view , the nocce is the following .
What 's allows all this choice in industrial society is material .
There are many places in the world , and you know , you know , what the problem is not they have too much choice .
The problem is they too little bit .
So the face face of the face I 'm talking about is a mentioned to modern , remember society .
And what does depriming and is this arrage is : Steve Levitt talked about how much those constantly and discover seats for whatever they are inuseless . It 's a sprequire of money .
I mean that these choices , complicated and dispendious , it 's not just inuses .
I 'm going to say of the eteries .
They do it stand worse .
If a little bit of what in our society allows allows choice was reversed in those where people are too few possibility , not just be the chance , not only be their life to improve , but also our .
This is what economists call a paretian improvement .
A refined refined it 's good at all -- not just to the poor -- not only to the poor -- because of this choice , in excess that we go back .
And to conclude , " You can become everything you want ,
You , you know , people are you , " What do that fish ? "
" It 's obvious that you can 't get it into a glass of glass . "
" Unimagination , a limited vision of the world -- "
And I 've interpreted it so , at the beginning .
But then , I think , instead , I realized that that fish the length of known .
Because the reality of fact is that if you sent the bocks , so that , " all you can 't get the freedom . You get the paralysis .
If you do it , you can be putting the satisfy , you can decrease the satisfy satisfy .
Accer the paralysis , and you 'll reduce the well-being .
Everybody needs a sphere .
This is almost certainly too , maybe even for fish , maybe even for fish , and certainly for us .
But the absence of some symolic symolic sphere is a recipe for infection and , for the roin .
Thank you .
