I 've been shown this last year , I 've been shown this slide that the glacial glacial , which for almost three million years had the size of the United States , it 's about 40 percent .
But this underestimated the gravity of the problem because it doesn 't show the ice of the ice .
The Cmmmess glacial calots is , in a certain sense , the heart of the global climate system .
You can expand winter down and you reverse .
The next next slide is going to be a quickly on the last 25 years .
The gets lost are signed in red .
You see , you walk up until the blue .
That 's the ice in the winter , which is the winter .
You can see that the cosiddy ice lost , of five years or more , is like the blood , which is like the blood , that 's like the blood , that you can see that the cosides from the body .
In 25 years , it 's been so , in 25 years , so .
This is a problem because the warming is the whole glacier around the ocean where there are enormous amount of coal congeled that , slightly , slighted , they come to the microbes .
Same totality to the totality of the global atmosphert , that quantity could doubling , that quanciity could doubling , super-spot of the willing .
In some deep in some deep in Alaska the metane is already rebulating the water .
The professoresse Katey Walter of Alaska of Alaska , was recently reverse with a team in a team ,
Video : Wow ! Al Gore : You 're good . The question is if we 're going to be in us .
A reason is that this thermal examples from the northermal examples from the northermal .
This is a glacial reme .
And he never had to reached it never reached it .
This is the Kangerlussuaq in the southwest of the Greenland .
If you want to know how the sale of the sea level of the ice of the ice on land , here is where you get the sea .
These corrups are increasing rapidly .
At the other side of the planet : Antarctickle of the planet .
The month , the scientists have been clearned that the balance of the ice is in negative , and that the Antarcticy Western , which is particularly fastern in some isoles , it 's particularly fastern in the smoke .
Equeral at six meters of the level of the acious like Greenland .
SulHimalayas , the third biggest block , you see new laghi , which few years ago were glaghi , which few years ago were glaciers .
40 percent of the world 's population was half of the world 's population from the skip .
Sulle Ande : this glacier is the source of the powerful water of this city .
The brought has increased .
But when it decrease it goes , the same happens to the same happens to the water .
In California the snow on the Sierra Nevada is 40 percent .
The backkkkkkkkkkils .
People , like you read , they 're free .
The growing growing security in the world leads to an remarkable rules .
The environmental disasters are increasing a rhythm out of the normal and without previous .
Four times more number in the last 30 years , I was respect 75 .
This is a whole thing about all unsustainable .
If you look at it in the historical consequences .
In the last five years we added 70 million tons of CO2 every 24 hours -- 25 million tons of tons in the ocean every day .
Look attention the East Pacific , from the East , from the American , and both the west , and both the parts of the Indian , where there 's a radical imor in the ocean .
Most of the global warming , together to deforestation , which is 20 percent of the fossil fuel use .
The oil is a problem , and the coal is even worse .
The United States are one of the two countries that are with China .
And he was going to build a lot of other central middle .
But we 're seeing a change of direction .
These are the projects in the last few years and some of alternatives of vernatives .
Every , you have a political political in our country .
The crule industries have spent 250 million dollars in the last year for promoting coal , which is a bone .
And this image of this picture --
I 'm going to be in the Natal Tennessee , where I live , there was a 3.8 billion lights of carbon snap .
Maybe you saw it on the news .
This is the biggest second flow of scories in America .
It 's happened around Natal .
The nature advertising of one of the coal industries was this .
Video : ♫ ♫ Frosty the carbon is a kind of allegro and happy .
It 's abondant here in America , and it 's going to grow our economy .
Frosty the carbon is and more and more public .
It 's good price , and it 's good , and the workers are keeping the stunning .
Al Gore : It 's here is a lot of the West Virginia .
The biggest mineral society is Massey Coal . This is his mountains .
Video : Don Blankenship : I 'm going to be -- Al Gore , Nancy Pelosi , Harry Reid -- they don 't know what they 're talking about .
Al Gore : So the Alleance for the Clima 's Protection 's launched two campaiged campaiged two campaiged campaiged two campaign .
This is one of them , a part .
Video : Actor : At : At the COLergy see we have climate change as a threat in our business .
So , our priority is to invest a large amount of money in a public public to make public and confused to make public and confused to the coal .
In fact , coal is not sports .
We think it 's clean -- it 's also a good smoke .
So not preocupateves of climate change .
Let me do it .
Video : Actually : Carbone , you heard a lot of it .
So , we make a turn in a structure at the pattern of the pattern ,
Straordinary ! The car is a little noious , but this is the sound of the clean technology .
The coal consumption is between the main the main the global causes , but the night of the clear that you see changes everything .
You 're a look at a look , this is the wood technology of clean .
Al Gore : Indeed , the positive alternative connects to economic question and at the economic security .
Video : Comvast America is in cribe ; the national security , the national security , the climate crisis .
The flows that all of them : our dependence from fossil fuel , like the fuel and the most important oil and the oil and the imported oil .
Now , though , there 's a new car , a new car solution for used .
Repower America : 100 percent of clean energy , in 10 years .
A piano to reput America to work , make sure , and make us more safe and help us stop global warming .
It was inally , a solution that you will solution our problems .
Repower America . Scover more .
Al Gore : This is the last .
Video : It 's about rewarming energy in America .
One of the fastest ways to get finally dependence from commostly , that they kill our planet .
What it 's the future is here . I 'm going to be , only one of the energy , a new energy web .
What it 's two : Noves for for a bad job retribes .
Comment : Repower America . It 's time to be realistic .
Al Gore : A old old old old African said , " If you want to go fast , you go to the walk .
If you want to go away , you go together . "
We have to go away , quickly .
Thank you very much .
I went to TED to the LHC in LHC .
And I promise to return to the nars on how the car works .
So here I 'm going to those that . And for those that the other time there were no LHC is the biggest scientific experiment ever -- 27 kilometers of circuster circuster .
His task is to remember the conditions that were under a billion one , at the beginning of the universe -- until 600 million times a second .
All of this is just environment .
This is the car under Ginevra .
We 're picked up these mini-Bang Bang in the relativelies .
This is what I 'm working . It 's called ATLAS -- it 's 44 feet , and it has a 22 meters .
This is an spectacular image of ATLAS in building so you can see the proportions .
Ten September year we have acceserl the car for the first time .
And this picture was taken by ATLAS .
It was causes in the control of control in the control .
It 's a picture of the first of the particles that had done all of the LHC , walking in collision , by a part of the LHC , and spreading particles in the releasy .
In other words , when we saw that image 10 September the 10 September , we understand that the car car , which is a big victory .
I don 't know if I was this to make us more or more or this , when someone went to Google and saw that the beginal page was this .
That means that we had a cultural impact on the scientific impact .
It was a week later , it was a problem with the car , I had to these dorry sleeping here -- these dored dored drugs .
These flowers are 13,000 printer when the car works at the maximum works of power .
Now , the technicians between you look at the flows and say , " It 's not true . They 're too much subtle . "
And instead they can do that when they 're very cool slide becoming cosidfiles .
So , at less 271 degrees , at a under the winner of the space between the stars , these floor stars , these floor to the corrate that corn .
In one of the juntures in one of the magnetic countries in the LHC , there was a focused of further .
So the flows up slightly , and the 13,000 priced practical resistance .
This was the result .
Now , this is even more impressive if you think that these magnets more than 20 tons , and that were moved about 30 centimeters , and that were moved about 30 centimeters .
They 're saying about 50 magnetets .
We had to take them , what we had to do .
We 've been repristined and it .
They 're now saying back all of their place .
And then , the end of the hamp the LHC will be again .
We will accind it , and we expect to get data to right or light , and continue so our adventure to the juy or lights that are the universe .
Now , of course , in a certain quarter , these accidents reaches the debate on the value of science and engineering engineering . It 's easy to confent .
I think that it 's so difficult , the fact of going to go beyond the limits , I think this is the value of things like LHC .
I 'd like to conclude with the words of a Inglad scientist , Humprey Davy , which , I think , in defense , in the inner of the experiments of his puple , he was Michael Faraday , said , " Nichael is so dangerous for human revenues that the ideas of the human rritense , which is not measure in nature , which is not measuring in the tribes that are not very very very very very very very very very very dangerent , and that we don 't know . " and that we 're not completes in the world . "
Thank you .
I want to start to ask you to rethink about when children , you play with kids , play with the morning .
As you understand how to reach them and sleeping them , and you get them and move them , and move them , and you know , you know , and you know , and you 're going to think of spacacaces .
The space reasoning is deeply connected to the way we understand the world around us .
So , from the information is the uslity of our interaction with objects , together to my consulation Patts , and my conon Patts , and my collaborator Jeevevan Kalanithi , I started asking up , " And if we use a computer , instead of having the only cursor as we can have the only cursor of the digital polar , which we could have a descent information with both hand-handing the landscape ,
and we sistemle it ?
The question was so interesting that we decided to explore the answer , building the answer , building the Siftable .
In a few words , a Siftable , is a big computer interactive , like a bunch .
In a few words , a Siftable , is a big computer interactive , like a bunch .
You can move them with your hand , they can see them , you know , you know , you feel the movement and they have a radio and a radio radio .
But most of them are physics , like physics , like the morning , you can just move them .
Siftable is a new ecosystem of tools to manipulate the digital information .
And as they 're going to be more physicists , consciously , of the other , and as they become more physicists , of the other , of how we move , of the other , of how we move , we can explore new and fun .
I 'll start with some simple example .
This Siftable is configurated to show the video : if you win a direction , the video role that it will run that if you include the other side .
These interactive ritrats are consciously aware of other .
If I look at what they 're interested in what they 're interested in what they 're around .
If they 're surrounded , and they can act a little bit .
If they 're surrounded , and they can act a little bit .
They also have their movement and inclination .
We then realized that one of the interesting implications was the power of the interaction was the power of using data , for example , " to you " a color like it was a liquid .
In this case , we have three Siftable configurated as secks and I can use them to the color in the midle , where they misses they misses .
and I can use them to put them in the middle , where they mix .
We can actually get a little bit of it . We can put a little place .
There are also beautiful possibility of learning , like languages , the math and games where people can try to see the fast things fast , and see the result , and see the result , and see the result .
Now , I 'm going to --
This is a Fibonacks that I do with a lot of equations .
Here we have a player of words that 's half of the words and Boggle .
Senically , at every turn a letter in any Siften in every Siftable , at every turn , you get a letter on every turn of Siftable , and while you 're trying to buy words in a direct .
Then , after about 30 seconds , you get a new set of reading and new ability to try .
Thank you .
Here 's a kids in the Media Lab , I did so that they tried them and I did a video video .
They were very much .
And one of the interesting things about this kind of application is that you have to give people many education .
You 've just got to say , " What they 're going to do . " And they know exactly what to do .
Here 's how other people are trying to .
This is our younger heads , there on the right there .
In fact , it just wanted to impact them .
They were just just doing it .
Now , this is an application of an interactive cardboard .
We wanted to build a tool for the learning of the Lui , is Felix .
It can insert new characters in the scene , solving the Siften , they 're just going to put them .
It can insert new characters in the scene , solving the Siften , they 're just going to put them .
So , it 's doing the sun .
Video : The Sun is surprising .
David Merrill : Now he brought a treator in the scene .
Video : The treator : The treator .
Bel work ! Yes ! Yes !
So I school with Siftable and put them close to the characters , and put up close to the characters --
Video : Bau !
and by by making their story .
Video : Hoo !
DM : It 's a story with the winal , and it can decide him how it flows .
DM : It 's a story with the winal , and it can decide him how it flows .
Video : Voly , that .
DM : The last example I have the time to show you a tool is a tool , realized of the purpose and exequal music .
It 's a tool , recently , to sample and sampling and exececk music .
Siftable here are cling from sounds like bass , bass and the bacteria .
Each one of these has four different variations , and you can choose what we use .
You can also be insert these sounds in a sequence to buy your lifetime .
And it just further to make a sound and a sequence . "
These are actually that you can control from the vive , like the reverbs and the filter .
I attacks to a particular sound , and then including it .
And then there are the general effects like time and fly , which you apply to the whole sequence .
We look at how it works .
Video : DM : We 're going to put a base in two Siftable Siftable , " we 're going to a series , we add the base .
Now I put a basis of a basis of a basis .
Video : DM : Now I 'm going to advancy --
Video : And I 'm going to put the bacteria at the bacteria , so I can control the effect from the vive .
DM : DM : I can fast the whole sequence to the whole sequence by one side or the other .
Video : And I 'm going to add the flower to give more expression .
Video : DM : I can recombined the flight .
So I didn 't have to make it first , but I can improvising it , but I can improvision longer or more corta .
And now , finally , I can smoke the whole sequence by smoking on the left Siftable . "
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is to build new interface murdering men and more more more more than our brain and the body how our brain and the body .
And today , I 've had time to show you one of the results of this lost , and also some chance that we try to bring out of the lab .
The concept I want to transmitted is that new generation of designed obdesigned to interact with digital media digital media , which will bring information in our world in the way we want .
Thank you very much .
I don 't see the time to talk to all of you .
They 're a writer .
I 'm writing books is my profession but it 's more than that , obviously .
It 's also love and the love of my life .
And I don 't expect that to change .
But , I said this , something particular happened in my life and in my life , and in my career , who brought me to recoaluring the whole thing with this .
The particular thing is that I recently wrote this book , this biography called " Mangogy , Prega , Ama , " which , diversity , for a few reason for some reason that I did , for some reason that I was going to be a big , sensationship , bestyle .
And the result is that everywhere , now , people treat me , the people treat me as if I were convicted .
I 'm going to do -- convicted , convicted ,
They go from me now everyone , and they say , " Don 't you fear of you can 't do any more ?
You don 't have fear to continue to write all life without able to be able to create a book that can important somebody to make a book that can important somebody ? "
what can important to someone one ?
It 's safe , you know .
But it could go worse , I remember that more than 20 years ago , when I started to say people -- I was a adolescent adolescent -- I was a writer .
I went to meet the same reaction from fear .
And people said , " Don 't temes I didn 't make succeeded ?
Don 't you fear that the humiliation of the rejection killed you ?
You don 't have fear to be able to do this for all life without that nothing you ever get out and to die on a cumouth of a such infrants with the bouth of falliment ? "
So , you know .
The answer -- the short answer to all these questions is , " Yes . "
Yes , I have fear of all those things .
I 've always had fear .
And I also fear of many other things that people could not inspire .
As the alges and other frightening things .
But , as I was writing it up what I was thinking about it , and I was very lately is why ?
Is it rational ?
It 's logic that anyone who has to expect to be sitting from a job that you feel like to do .
But what 's there so particularly in the impress creative to make us nervous health mental health other than they do not ?
As my father , for example , he was a chemist engineer and I don 't remember of one in his 40 years of activity where he asked if she was fear to be engineer ?
Never was -- that block of the John 's engineer John , how do it ?
Don 't work that , you know ?
Onestly , the chemistrings like group don 't certainly have no , in the secocles , driven the reputation of being maniaces .
We writers , we have this reputation , and not just creative , but creative of each gender , we have this reputation of being instable mentally .
And I 'm not going to look at the sad of the sad magnificent deaths , just in the century century , just in the century , they died young and often for them .
And the ones that they don 't have suicipate data , they 're really dissatives from their dons .
Norman Mailer , before he die in the last interview , he said , " Every my book kill me a little bit more . " A extraordinary affermation about their life .
But we don 't buy cily when we feel that because we 've heard these things that in some way we 've completely interior accepted , and the notion that creativity and suffering are in some way you and that art , at the end , at end , it will be going to be in the ancient .
And the question I want to get all of here today is : you 're song with this idea ?
It 's good that you 're going to look at a himeter from a distance to me , it doesn 't good for anything this suppose .
I think it 's hately hately .
And I think it 's also dangerous and I don 't want to see the perpetuated in the next century .
I think it 's better encourage our big creative minds .
And I know that , in my case -- in my situation -- it would be very dangerous to start smoking up to that heard of the supposition , most dangerous circumstances in which I 'm in my career .
That 's really -- insum you look , they 're pretty young , I 'm pretty young , I have about 40 years .
I have still about four decades decades .
And it 's very likely that any thing write about now , then it will be judled by the world as the work that I did after my book .
I 'm going to be slavery , because we 're all likely , that my greatest success is that my greatest myes is the greatest myself .
Oh , Gesus , who thought !
You know this is the kind of thought that leads a person to start to get a person to start gin the morning and I don 't want to do it .
I would keep going to keep doing this work that I love .
So , the question becomes , how to ?
And so it seems to me , after many reflections , that the way to work to continue to write is to create a psychological costruct costruct , OK ?
I have to have a few way to find a security between me , which I 'm writing , and my natural anxiety about which is going to be able to get other society , and I was trying to look at the time , trying to find them to look through the time , trying to find some society to see if they could have some society to see if they could have the best ideas and more snake to be able to have some society to see if they could have the best ,
about how to help creative people who are creative to managing the risks of creativity .
And that research has led me to the ancient Great and ancient Rome .
Seguitem because it gets in circle and then go back .
In the ancient Great and ancient Rome -- the people didn 't seem to believe that creativity was , OK ?
They thought that creativity was this spirit of creativity is that they were sitting in the men , for some surprising source , for reasons and unknown .
The green called us : The greenhouse gets were called " demons . "
Sococrate , wonderful , he was believed that I had a demon that elart wisdom .
Romans were the same idea , but they were called that spirit that kind of spirit a genius .
which is great , because Romanian thought that a really was a genius that a genius was not really a genius .
They believe that a genius was this kind of a divine that was created in the walls of an artist , a little bit like the Dobby , and that was like the Dobby , and that was going out out to be treated to the work of artist and modeling the outcome of the artist and model the outcome of that job .
Exctional -- here is the distance of which I talk about -- that psychological costruction that protective costruction that protective from the results of your work .
And everybody knew that was so that it worked , right ?
So , the antiks were protected by certain things , like , for example , like the narciysm , right ?
If your work was exceptional , you could not take all the deserve , everybody knew that you were helped by this incorporate genius .
If your fault work , it wasn 't all your bad , right ?
Everybody knew that was your genius to be a incapable .
And so the people who were conceived creativity in the West for a long time .
Then Rinascivation came and everything changed , and it all changed , and we put this big idea ; we put the human being in the center of the universe all and measure and measure and no leaving space to the demitions that they write from divinity .
This was the main of humanity , and people started thinking that creativity was completely about the creativity was completely by the idividouth .
And for the first time in the history , you started to reference to this or that artist like a rather that one person with genius .
And I have to tell you , I think it was a big error .
I think it allows someone , a simple person to believe that it 's like a recipient like a source , and the source of all the divines , creative , unknowable and ethern is a responsibility a too big to give to the fragile psychc human-human-humans .
It 's like to someone to ingue the sun .
Deas and shapes the whole ego and creates all of these inexistable expectations on performance .
And I think it was this pressure to destroyed the artists in 500 years .
And if this is true , and I think it 's , the question becomes , and now ?
Can we do it different ?
Maybe back to a more ancient understanding of human relationship between human and mistery .
Or maybe no .
Maybe we can 't cell 500 years of rational thinking in a 18 minutes .
And probably there is people in the audience that would sollevered to scientific the notion of the nice , insom , you do that they follow people to spend or huge their projects .
I 'm probably not going to convince everybody about this .
But the question I 'd like to take is -- why not ?
Why not think that way ?
Because it 's more sense than ever else than ever ever heard to explain the exaspering impreveilability of the process .
A process that , as anyone who ever tried to do something -- so , all here , all of them here -- everybody here -- you don 't understand , you know , you don 't understand rationally .
And , in fact , it can sometimes it looks completely paranormal .
I did this meeting with the extraordinary poetesse Ruth Stone , who has now 90 years , but that was a poeteshold for all life and said he was a poetesholding for all life and told me that , in his childhood , and he was working out in the Virginia , and he was going to be in the rural landscape .
He said she was like a broken sleeping air .
And that was rotling to her from landscape .
He was hearing , because he was going to make the land under his feet .
He had a only knew thing to do about that , and it was to , " run like a matta . "
And so it goes back to this poem , and he wouldn 't have to make it more than take a piece of paper and a fast enough , and a match on a couple , and he would take it and sweeping it on the page .
Sometimes he couldn 't be fastly , so he was , so he goes and run without to come home and her rotolate the rotolate rotolate through the landscape , and he would keep up through the landscape , and he said , " one more poet . "
Then there were those times -- this piece I 'm going to be able to -- there were some moments where it was almost loss , OK ?
So , she was running up to the card and he was trying to the paper and the poetry was going through , and he was a huge in the way , and then he said , that was like to sleep with the other hand and the step .
He was going to the poem from and put it in his body and put it in his body and swriting on the page .
And in these cases , the poem was shown on the perfect page and intention , but the last word at the first word .
So when I felt it -- it 's a crazy , it 's exactly equal to my creative process .
Not all my creative process -- I 'm not a condition .
I 'm a music , and my way of work is , and I 'm a wake up at the same oraries every day and sweet and go down .
But even I , in my head , I 've striped against that thing , sometimes .
And I 'm suppose that many of you this han fact .
You know , even if the work and ideas were given me from a certain source I could not have to know , I could not yet .
And what is this thing ?
And how we can relationate to it in a way that we don 't do lose the head , but , rather , rather , what does it do to make us snans ?
As I 'm going to be the best example , I 'm the best example I have is the Tom Waits , which I interviewed a different years ago for a newspaper .
We were talking about this , and you know , Tom , for most of life was the incarnation of the life was the indicating , trying to control , trying to control , gesting these species of creative totally interized these species of creative totally interized .
But then I invited , he calculated , and one day as he was driving on a car calculus in Los Angeles , he changed everything for him .
He was going to go fast and all of a tract tract , and it 's a little bit of melody , which comes in his head as it does inspiration , and the wants , you know , it 's wonderful , and it 's desider , but not how you take it .
It doesn 't have a piece of paper , it doesn 't have a matit , it doesn 't have a cler .
So he begins to hear this kind of old old anxiety in him like , " I 'm going to lose , and I 'm obsessed by this song .
I 'm not good enough and I can 't do it . "
And instead of going to go in the panic , he stop .
I 'm going to put the whole mental process and he did something completely new .
I just look at the sky and he said , " Shush , I 'm not seeing that I 'm driving ? "
" You know , " Do you know a song now ?
If you really want to existing , go back to a more opposer when I can take care of you .
Arements , I walked to make any other today .
You 're going to disturban to disturban . "
And his process was working changed after this .
I don 't work , the work was still dark like .
But the process , and the fish that was that was rewarded when the genius , the genius , the genius that was going , the genius that was going , and he remainly remainly remainly , and he was made that she didn 't have to be an interior , and come back .
but it was very much bad , it wonderful , bizarre collaboration in Tom and this strange thing that it was not Tom .
So , as I felt that story started changing a little also a way that I was working , and already to me once .
This idea , I was saved when I was writing " Mangan , Prega , " and falls in one of those cause of the disperation where we all see when we 're working on something and we can 't start to think that it will be a disaster , which is going to be the worse , which is going to be the worse .
Not just bad , just the worst book .
And I started thinking about gone this project .
But then I remember Tom that was talking about the air and I tried us .
So I got my face in the wait in the sheep and I was switch in a vacuum .
And I said to high voices , " You know , what we 're going to know if this little not be unbrilliant , not be interestingly hit , right ?
Because as I see a little bit of it all I have , I don 't have that .
So if you want it to be better , you have to pressure and make your part .
OK . But if you do not , you know what , I don 't do .
I 'm going to write the same because it 's my work .
And I 'd like to make that was recorded that I 've been presented to do my part . " Because it 's so , finally , it 's so , you know , secows ago , and he was so , OK -- secows of the damances of the cheat of the chunk of the middle , and music that they were going to go on for hours and hours .
And they always were magnific , because the ballerini were professionals and they were amazing .
But every once , rarely , something happened , and one of these artists become actually transendent .
And I know that I know what I 'm talking about , because I know you 've seen one a point , a performance like this .
It was like the time stopped , and the dancing walked through a kind of a kind of ballery , and it wasn 't doing anything that 's about different from the usually , but all of them .
And suddenly not appeared as a human .
But it turns out to the winside of the divinity in the fire of the divinity .
And when this was happening , at the time , the people knew what they call it with her name .
They were sunger the hands and began to cancer , " Allah , Allah , God . "
That 's God , you know .
Curious known -- when the More the Spain , when the south of Spain , they took this abits and pronounce in the cheat . Elah , Allah , " Elah , " Elah , " run , " which you can still feel in the rock in the short .
In Spain , when an artist has done something that you can impossible and magic , " Allah , the run , " Allah , " I was a wills , " I walked . "
And it 's great because we need it .
But , the problem is the day after the dancing the dancing itself , when you wake up and discover that are the 11 of the morning of Martedyes and goes out of God there is no longer .
It 's just a mortal with ginock to the ginock , and maybe it will never come to that already will ever be able to height .
And maybe no one cancer the name of God still as it goes , and what you have to do with her life ?
It 's difficult .
This is one of the most painful reciliations to make in a creative life .
But maybe it doesn 't have to be so angosh to be so angosh , if you can 't believe , the most extraordinary aspects of your being from yourself .
But you just believe that you have been data in prested by an unimaginable source of this source of your life that you have to go to someone else else when you finished .
And , you know , if we think it all changes .
And so I started thinking about , and it 's sure , and it 's just like this , I thought for different months in the work of the book that public , I 'm going to public , spent , I spent , spent , I 'm going to follow my great success .
And what I have to continue to say when I feel elected by this is , not having fear .
Don 't just go . It 's just your work .
It 's a presentation of your part , any part of your part , any being .
If your work is balling , balls .
If the devine , you know , you know , he was assummarvels to leave some kind of wonderful , for one moment through your efforts , just for one moment through your efforts , then " Okay ! "
You 've got to do the same your dance .
And I said , " Ole ! "
I think I believe that I was going to teach it .
" Okay you , " Oh , even for you had had had had to love and heads , so that you can present continuously present continuously .
Thank you .
Thank you .
June Cohen : Ole !
As you know , I 've already talked about some of these projects on the human genome , what it can significant and the discovery of genes .
Now we 're starting a new pattern : we started digitalizing biology and now to start to the biology and now , we 're entering in a new phase of biology , designing and synthesizing life .
We 've always been trying to bring big questions .
" What is life ? " It 's something that many biological biological I think they 've been trying to understand vary livels .
We tried different approaches , reduced to the terms .
We 're digitalizing almost 20 years .
When we sequenced the human genome was to pass from the analogical world of the computer in the digital world of the computer .
Now we asked us : we can regenerate life , or create new from this digital universe ?
This is the map of a small organism , the Mycoplasma genitalium , which is the species from the smallest genome that can autoreplicate in the lab .
And we tried to reduce the ulteriorly to create one more smaller .
We 're able to eliminate a hundred genes of the genes of about 500 that I 'm here .
But when we do a look at his metabolic map , it 's relatively simple respect to our .
I think , this is simple .
But when we look at all the genes that we can eliminate , one at the time , it 's very unlikely that this can bring a living cells .
So we decided that the only way to progrew this was synthesizing this cromodify to the components to bring some of these fundamental questions .
And so we started the " Can we synthesize a cromosome ? "
It can be the chemistry consciously we never had to create before we 've never done to create before we 've ever done to create before we 've never done ?
And , in case , we can make a cromosome ?
A cromosome is simply a piece of chemist of chemist .
The speed that we 're able to digitalize life is growing up to the exponential exponential .
Our skill our skill code , instead , instead , rather , rather slowly , but it 's improving .
And our most recent results the branching on a exponential curve .
We started more than 15 years ago .
The process has require a lot of pass , beginning with a biothical review before we begin the first experiments .
But we found that that that synthesizing that is very difficult .
There are tens of thousands of cars in the world that produces are small segment of DNA , the longer of 30 to 50 letter and it 's a degenerative process : the longer segment is longer , the segment is more errors .
So we had to develop a new method to assembly these brothers and correct the herrors .
And this was our first attempt , to start to the digital information of the genome of Phi 174 .
It 's a little virus that kills .
We designed the fragments , we had the correction of errors and get a molecules of DNA about about 5,000 letters .
The interesting part is when we took this piece of chemist of chemist material , and we put it in the bacteria , the bacteria have started to read this genetic code and producing the viral particles .
The viral particles were requated by the cell , they 're back and destroyed the cell .
I talked about recently with membrroify membrings of the oil industry tells that they have certainly compress .
They 've got more than you .
We believe this is a situation where the software can really build his hardware in a biological system .
But we wanted to do things in big things .
We wanted to build the whole cromosome of the bacteria .
They 're more than 580 miles the letters of genetic code .
So we thought I was building it in the size of the virus , so that we can change the cassettes to understand what they are the components of a living cells .
People are crucial , and if we start with digital information in a computer , these have to be very accurate .
When we sequence this genome for the first time in 1995 , the standard was a herror for every 10 mirror to every 10 miles .
We found , we found it , 30 mistakes . If we had that original sequence , we would never be able to do that work .
One part of the process is designing longer segments that you oversee , they 're all sorts of 50 letters to build letter to build more small underunits of the smaller , working together .
We try to the only one here .
You probably have read that we put that in the levels .
Think it so : we have a genetic code on four letters : A , C , G and TG and TG and TG and .
Three of those letters together code about 20 minoacids , and there 's a specific order of reading for every amount of reading .
So we can use the genetic code to write words , sleeping , sleeping thoughts .
What we did at the beginning was autograppy to do it .
Some were in the fact that it wasn 't poem .
We designed these segments to just une with it .
There are encounters that repair them and put them assime .
And we started assembling to assembling to segments from five to segments from five to seven mils , unending them to segment in a way to make 24 miles .
So every step we 've made these sequence in abundance so that we 're trying to make a very very very very very very very robustood -- you 'll see in a minute .
We 're trying to automatizing the process .
So , this looks like the tabellon a basket .
When we get to the way to these very long segments , more than 100 miles , they 're not going to grow more directly in the E. coli .
You get to the limit of modern the limit of modern molecular biology .
So we 've looked at other mechanisms .
We knew about one mechanism called homologue recombination , which in biology to repair the DNA can une that you can une the segments .
Here 's an example .
This organism , called Deinococcus radiodurans , it can absorbed three million rad of radiation .
You can see in the superior like his chromosome .
In 12 -- 24 hours , it 's just like it before .
They have thousands of organisms that they 're able to do it .
These organisms you can sea completely .
They can live under a vacuum .
They 're absolutely certain that life exists in space , and you move to find new water .
In the real , NASA showed that this happens .
This is a picture of the molecule that we built through these processes , just using the levered design segments with the segments of the segments .
The least assemble to the authention .
This image was not taken with a microscope , but with a microscope , but with a microscope a regular microscope .
It 's a very big molecules that we can see it with a microscope .
These are pictures that cover a period of about six seconds .
This is the publish that we did a little time ago .
They 're more than 580,000 letters of genetic code .
It 's the largest molecule of a definitely structure created by man .
It has a weight molecular weight to 300 million .
If we were going to be in a 10 careful caring , you would like 142 pages only to transform this genetic code .
Now , how do we do it work ?
Of course , you know , a virus is a yd game .
It 's a little more complicated when they use .
It 's also more simpler when it is about cell ekariote like our : you can just extract the nucleus and insert one more , which is basically the clonation process .
In the archaea , the archaea is instead of instead in the cell , but we have recently demonstrated that we can do a transplant transplant by a cell to another and activity .
We can have a bunch a participating cromosome .
two are how you men from the tops .
We have added a few gene in more so that we could decide what choose for this chromosome .
And then he skip up with the ency in a way to kill all the proteins .
And when we put it in the cell in the cell was stunew -- and you open our sophisticatogist -- the new cromosome .
And we were we thought that we could 't go beyond , but we 've tried anywhere .
This is one of the major mechanisms of evolution .
We found that a lot of species have added a second or a third or a second , a cromosome of new tracks in a thousands of new tracts of new tracts to that species .
So who think about evolution as a only gene to evolution as a only gene has no understood ,
There 's a restription that is called " restription that advancy digerisn 't that digery digm digery .
The cromosome that was in the cell of it was in the cell of it .
The cell cell cromosome that we inserit-cell .
It 's expressed , and he recognized the other cromosome as a material material , and we were ritting it with only the cell and the new cromosome .
it became blue because of the genes that we put .
And in a short leave all the characteristics of a species are going lost , and it turned out of all a new species , based on the new software that we put in the cells .
All of the protein are changed , membranes are changed , and when we read the equivalent genetic code what we 've been transfer to what we 've transfer .
Now , this may seem alchemy genetic , but it 's altering the software , we can change things in a very fundamental enough .
Now , I 've already explained that you don 't talk about the genety -- but we progress from three million years and a half of evolution , and I 've already said that maybe we 're going to create a new version of the Cambrian explosion of this digital process .
Why do that ?
I think it 's quite obvious when we think about our necessities .
We 're going to go from six and a half billion people in the next 40 years .
Just to give you an example : I was born in 1946 .
Now , there are three people on the planet for each existing in 1946 , there are going to be four .
We 're having problems now to find food , fresh water and clean , medical medical and a half billion and a half billion and a half billion people .
It 's going to be more touches to do it for nine billion .
We use more than five billion bets , more than 30 billion bets , more than 30 billion bets of oil .
That means millions of baries a day .
When we try to find biological processes , or any kind of process to reduce them , it 's going to be a huge challenge .
We have to keep all the time of CO2 from these materials that end up in the atmosphere .
At day day , thank you to scientific discoveries all the world , we have a database with about 20 million genes , and I like to think they are the designed for the future .
The electronics that only only is a dozen about components , and you think about how many different things were come out .
Our limits here are maplently from reality , and our imagination .
Now we have a techniques , thank you , because we 're going to create what we call figure out the combatory genomics combatory .
We 're able to build a big robot that can produce a million cromosome of cromosome day .
Think of processing these 20 million genes or to try to get the processes to produce eight-year-old genes , and we can change , because we can change , we can change , thank you , and we can change , because in the last 20 years of science .
And it 's just a standard selection .
We can choose for survival , production , chemistry production , or fuel , production of etc vaccines .
This is an instantaneous instantaneous of some software that we 're working on to be able to seat and design species .
Well , we don 't necessarily know how they will be .
We know exactly what they 're genetic code .
Now we 're concentrating on the fourth of quarters .
You also saw you that ethanol from gran experiment in the bad was a bad experiment .
We have a lot of second-generation and third generation that will be surroundle of higher than the value , like eight-value types of butanol .
But the only way that biology can have a big impact without increasingly increasingly the cost of food and limitate the cost of food and limitate it would transform CO2 in matter , where we 're working on the cell that can make this discovers , and we can make this discovers , and we could have the first couple of these generation in about 18 months .
The sunlight sunlight with the CO2 is a metodownstood -- but in our discoveries all the world , we found different metods .
This is an organism that we described in 1996 .
It lives in the deeption of the deeption of the deepest temperature of ebollition of the water .
They 're metane they 're using the molecular hydrogen , like a molecular source .
We 're trying to figure out if we can clear the CO2 , which can easily be translated by tubes , convert that CO2 in carburing this process .
So we think we could be able to increase what we could be able to increase what the basic question of what is life is Nice . " We have the compared , we have the goal of rempize the entire industry .
Exactly . If you don 't do it from TED , where you can ?
It would be a main source of energy .
And also , we 're working on using the same metods to create instant vaccines .
You saw this year with the flu , we 're always back of a year and a year , and a dollar under when it 's about found the vaccine is going to the fair .
I think that you can change in combines in an anables in anables .
Here 's how the future could start to seem to change , now , the tree of evolution , accelerating the synthetic evolution with synthetic bacteria , archaeucarium .
We 're so much from the best people .
Our is to do a long enough to live long enough to try to do it . Thank you very much . Thank you very much .
I 'm going to do all see , the most rapidly possible , some fundamental work , a new job , that we 've taken to Microsoft , which we 've taken to the Microsoft , this is Seadragon .
It 's a environment in which you can interact is at local level that remote with a enormous amount of data .
Here we 're seeing a lot of digital gigabyte pictures with a kind of photosting and continuous , for a panoramic speed , disponing the images as we want .
And it doesn 't matter how big the amount of information that we see , how big these are the data or the images of data or the images .
Most of them are common photographs , but this for example is a scanning from the Biblic of Congress , and relower in the city of 300 megapies .
It doesn 't make any difference because the only thing that limit the prestations of a system like this is the number of pixel on your screen in any moment . It 's an very flexible architecture .
This is an entire book , example of data doesn 't have data .
This is the Casa desolate of Dickens . Every colonn represents a chapter .
For you show you that it 's just about textbook and not of images , we can do something like that , to make a real real representation of the text , not a picture .
It could be a little artificial way to read a book .
I don 't know it .
This is an most realistic example . It 's a number of the Guardian .
Every big image is the beginning of a section .
And it really gives you the pleasure and the beautiful experience of a cardboard or a quotidian , which is for nature or a quotidian , which is for nature a molteam .
We also did something with the corner of this particular number of the Guardian .
We created a higher advertising advertising -- much more higher than what you use in a normal publish . And we put you in a normal advertising .
If you want to see the characteristics of this automobile , you can see them here .
Or other models , or even the specific patterns .
And this really demonstrates a few of these ideas to eliminate the space limits of the screen .
We hope that it means you end up to the pop-up and other cheries like this , not should be necessary .
Of course , the map is one of the most obvious applications for this kind of technology .
And I don 't want to lose time , if you don 't say that we have contributes to this in this field .
These are all the streets in the U.S. .
So , we 're going to be in something else .
This is actually actually from the wild on the web ; you can see it .
It 's a project called Photosynth , which combine two different technologies .
One is Seadragon and the other is a visual research an at Noah Snavely , a student of the University of Washington , with Steve Steve Steve Seitz . The UW and of Microsoft Rick Sisisiski . It 's a very good research .
And it 's from Seadragon the web , gond from Seadragon .
You can see this when we do this kind of scream , where we can go from a image to the other and have this kind of experience in the other , and have this kind of experience .
But the space space of the images here has actually a meaning .
The algorithms of visualization computers have registed these images together , so that corresponding to the real place place place in real places that the imaging -- all of the scared in the Roccious Woccivil -- were taken . Here we 're taken . Here we 're taken . Here , where you see elements of one slides or imaging , these things were all related to the space of the space .
I don 't know if I have time to show you some more environment .
There are some more space .
I want to spend directly to one of the original data of Noahy-prototype of Photosynth that we did for the first time , you know , you know , to show you what I think is really the key is the key to the key that I think is really the key behind this technology , Photosympth . And it 's not necessarily evident . And it 's not necessarily ,
We had to worry about the legal aspects and forward .
This is a reconstruction of Notre of the Notre of Dame . Bastic press from Flickr . Bastic Din Flickr and you get images of types in the maglights , other of the campus , other of the campus , and so on . Each one of these conies a picture that is discovery of this model .
So they 're all sorts of Flickr and were all connected to this way .
And it 's possible to navigate this way simple .
You know , I would never have thought about wind to work for Microsoft .
It 's very gratifying to remember this kind of accounence here .
I think you can see that it 's a lot of different types of different phones of phones that you have a lot of phones in the phones in the SLR , a significant number , meaning , they had a significant , they put together in this environment .
And if I can go and try to look for those strange .
Many they were blown by doing , etc .
Some here some part here is a series of photographs -- eccole .
This is a Notre poster of Notre Dame recorrectly .
We can go from the poster to the vision of this environment .
The essential point is that we can do with social environment . This now is taking data from the ential memory of how the earth , the visual view of the visual rescue -- and connects all of those data together together .
All those pictures become , more than the sum of the parts of the sum of the parts .
You have a model of the whole model that emerge .
Think about this as a prolunger Lawler on Earth virtual Earth 's work .
It 's something that grows in complexity as they use , and the people that are using it , and the advantages to the use .
Their picture are marced with the other people .
If someone is the idea of the idea of those data saying the name , my name picture of Notre of the catthedral of Notre Dimproviviously , and I can use as a point of all of these data , and I can use the kind of inspiring in that space , in that metaphing the photographs of all , and have a cross-moot-like social experience of cross-mobile cross-mooth .
Of course , a consequence of this is virtual models of any interesting , in the earth , collected by any interesting , you know , you know , not just from the plane and satellite images and similar images , but from the collective memory .
Thank you very much .
Chris Anderson : I understand ? What 's what your software is going to us to do is that a certain point in the next few years , all the photographs , all the shared photographs from anyone in the world will be basically connected by everyone in the whole world will be until together ?
BAA : Yeah . That 's what it 's doing is actually discover .
It 's creating hyperlink , if you want , between images .
And it 's doing it in the basis in the content of the images .
The thing becomes very interesting if you think about the wealth of semantic information that that many of these images are possible .
As you do a research of images on the web , you type a fastern and the text on the web page has a lot of information about the images .
Now , what happens if that pictures you connect all your picture ?
So the amount of interconnection and the amount of wealth that is really enormous . It 's a huge classical classical . It 's a classical classical classical .
CA : Blaise , it 's really incredible . It 's really amazing .
BAA : I thank you very much .
One of the main piaces of the main research and one of the research nographic research is the living in the anti-traditions , the traditions , the vent in the wind , the wind , the wind in the plants , and drive in the plants .
And you 're thinking that sciamans are still travel even the Lattea , or that the Inuit 's still a model that the Inuit still are meaningful , or in Himalayas , the budddmists are still follow the respair of Dharma , to remember the major makes the importance of the Dharma , to remember the important model of the reality ,
the consequence of a particular set of adaptic choices that our own stropy , good or a generations ago .
And , of course , all shared by the way .
We all hire . We all try . We all try .
We are subjects at the begination .
We need to deal with the inesorability of death , so it doesn 't surprise and we 're sitting if we cantiming and ballize --
We all have an art .
What it hits is the particular rhythm of the song , the rate of every culture .
Not that they 're the thought of the Borneo , or the Borneo , or the follows of Haiti , or the Haiti 's Kaisut in Kenya Saitt Kenya Saiting in Kenya Saharm .
He was my journey of journey in the desert a month ago , or an hyak along in the Everest , the dea month of the world .
All of these people are teaching us that there are other ways of exists of thinking , other ways of music in the world .
And if you reflect a moment , it 's a concept that you can give you hope .
Insized , cultures of the world 's cultures create a spiritual life , cultures that we flip the planet , and cultural life that we have the planet as the neighborhood as the biological ragela .
And you can think about this cultural ragela like a labela and you can define the sover of all concepts , dreams , moved , dreams , moved , ideas , inspiations , inspiration , inspirations , inspiration , inspiration ,
The etnosphere is the patrist of humanity .
It 's the symbol of what we are and what we can be in how species .
And because the bossphere was a very quickly consumed altreat the etnosfetnosh and purpose much more .
No biologist , for example , it would say that 50 percent of all species was or is on the hort of the simply of the extinction because it 's false -- in the most optimistic , in the most optimistic diversity -- and I don 't even close to the most optimistic of all species -- that of the different cultural critical .
The indict of all this is , of course , the language .
When you were born 6,000 languages on this planet .
A language is not just by a vocabulary or a series of rules or a series of rules .
One language is the pair of the human spirit .
It 's the middle of each culture comes in the material world .
Every language is a forest of the mind , a little bit of the mind , a thinking of spiritual possibility .
And of those 6,000 languages , as we 're sitting here in Monterey , at least half , it doesn 't be surrated in the ears of the ears of the ears .
They don 't get more teached to kids , which means , unless you wouldn 't walk , which are already death .
What 's there more sad than the sad of being the silence , of being the last few to talk a language , not to have a language of transmitting the wisdom of advice or advoccurred or to promise their children ?
This is a fashion was the state of someone in some of the world every two weeks : every two weeks are a living muore and brings in the last syllabes of a ancient language .
And I know somebody 's going to say , " Isn 't it better ?
The world would not a better place if we talk all the same language ? " Benism , then we talk all yoruba . We talk about cantonese .
We talk kogs .
You will discover a tract thing that means not to talk about your language .
And I would like to do a journey through the laby --
a little journey in the ethnosh to give you a little bit of what we 're losing .
Many of us forget that when I say , " different ways of existing really different ways of existing .
So let 's take for example this Barasana , in Amazon , the sector 's population , the population population , which creating the myth of the site of the site of the site in the site of the site in the site of the site .
It 's a popular that is not able to distinguish the blue that is identified in the green because it 's identified in the time of the forest , which depends on the population .
They have a strange language and a matrimonial regulated , " " " " you have to move a different person . " You have to move a different language .
And all of that radical in the past , yet the particularity is that in these exists in these families that you talk about six or seven language because of marriages nobody practice .
They 're limited to listen to listen and then they start to talk .
We take one of the most interesting tribes that I 've lived , the Wadoans of Ecuador Ecuador , a population that has had the first contacts in 1958 .
In 1957 , five missionaries have been trying to a common contact a factor .
They did it down to the photographed that they had had been done in a few that was that they had never seen that this populating populating that this population population had never seen bi-dimensional forest .
They collected the photographs , they turned to the research of a form or a figure out , and not find nothing , they have concluded that they were treated that they were going to be able to the five missionaries with the lance .
But the Waorani doesn 't just kill the strange of the foreign .
They killed with them .
54 percent of the mortality was caused by themselves .
We were risalites to get generations and we found two cases of natural death , and when we insight to know , they had a lot of them to know , they had a tremendous knowledge of the forest .
The clean of the hunters that we 've got 40 steps and recognizing the species .
In the first 1980s , I was assigned a very interesting task when my Harvard , he asked me if I wanted to go to Haiti to intruly intruly in the secret company in the secret of Duvalier and Turn Macoutes , and I can be able to do the zombie zombie .
To give a sense of miraculous miraculous , I should understand the Vodouth culture and that Vodouldn 't be magic .
It 's pretty much of a complex metaphysical view of the world .
Very interesting .
If I asked you to tell me me the big religions of the world , what would you say ?
Christianesimum , Islam , Budddism , Ebraism , etc .
A continent is always left out , thinking that the sub-Saharan Africa has no religious field has no religious field . And instead is not that the distillated of these religious concepts in the tragic tragic concepts in the tragic tragic tragic tragic concepts .
What makes the interesting voodoo is the intense relationship between life and death .
So , you know , the spirits .
The spirits can be invited by Great Acqua , respected to the dance of dance and replacement at the soul of the vive of the view in a shorange that for a brief a long time that you can make the goal .
So , the voods , you know , " You can go white white white you 're going to talk about God .
We say in the temple and divention and divention . "
And from the moment that you 're going to be the spirit that you 're driving you , how you can do you get the evil ?
So you 're going to see these incredible events : follow voodoor in state of trance that touch unfuocated a rather exhibition demonstration , rather than the power of the mind on the body of the body in the body of extreme , when it 's catalyzed in a state of extreme , exciting .
In all the popular all the populations that I 've lived the most extraordinary are the Kogi of the Santa Marta DSanta Marta , Colombia sector .
Do sell of the ancivilization that once they live the characters of Colombia in the conquitness of the conquitude , the population was on the massive smooth , which ervulcanic planning .
In a blood continent macky , this population was never conquned by the Spanish .
And now they 're now from a clero but their formation is decision-extraordinary .
The young people follow come away from the family three or four years , and live secregated in a world that they did good and shared in a world that you have a good pattern for 18 years .
Two draw hincome to reduce the nine months of gestation that spend in the user of the gestation that spend in the user of the Great Mother .
So , all of the time , they get acculturated to the values of their society , values that they predict their predict and just their predict their own cost or to say , or to the cost ecological balance .
At the early of this incredible began , they 're improvisually taken and the first time in 18 years , when they 're 18 years old , they see an alba . And in that account of the first clay , when the sun , the sun of beautiful landscape , everything they 've learned in theory , everything they 've learned in this splending . The prete is a step house . The precisely ago , when he tells a past on the past . The pushers of the early wrong , and he says ,
" Visy , I 'm like to be .
It 's amazing . Now it 's about you protecting it . "
They 're called they call the major brothers and say that we , brothers , we 're the colputes of the world .
This is intuition is extremely important .
When we think about the Ingene and the environment we 're in the environment and the old story of the noble badvice , which is a razy concept in his simplicity or perhaps , and we say that these populations are close to the Earth of us .
The populations are not excited by the nostalogy .
There 's no space for these things in the palues of the Aststststicle or the Tibet , but thank you , and they created a mistics of the Earth 's based on the end of the Earth 's based on a balloon of the planet 's based on a balloon a balance .
What does it mean ?
It 's a little boy of Ande that a boy of Ande that the mountain is a spirit that will drit his destiny is a human being being a destiny different , and it 's going to have a different relationship with the mountain or that place , or that place in the Montana or that place is a little bit of a mountain mass of rock that a mountain mass of rock that a mountain rock of being stheless .
which is the demour of a spirit or a mineral or a mineral was irrelevant .
What 's interesting is the metaphor that defines the relationship between the individual and the natural world .
I grew up in the forest of the Britannica credating that the forest service to be cut .
And that was made me a human being from my friends Kwakiutl that believe that the forests are the Hukuk dimora of Hukuk and the old stories of the paradise and the high cannibal snibal that live in the earth of the Hukey , spirits that they 're going to the last .
If you start to look at that these cultures can create different reality , you can start to understand some of them sensitive sensationally . We take this plant .
I took this picture to open in the northern Amazon the northern Amazon .
Maybe some of you have heard about the ayahuasks , the most powerful pitches of the sciamanic repertoic repertoic repertoic repertoist .
What makes the playahumps the ayahumps is not the potential of the physical power , but his elaboration . It 's composed by two elements .
In a hand , this leaving lean-hand , this lian under quicken , harming and harming moles , slightly slightly slightly .
You know , you know , you get the smoke , you have a blue that it a little bit of consciousness , but it 's michoice with the leaves of a family said , Psychotria redis .
This plant contains powerful , very similar powerful , very similar to serotonin the methoxoxyplyplypltryplyplyplyplyplyplyplypls .
If you ever see you will see Yanomami , you know , the substance that they make from a different set of species , anched methoxyltryplyplyplyslens .
After that polly-up on the nose is a bit like being sparated by a smoke of paper paper paper , and landing on a sea of electricity . Risated no creates a distortion of reality .
I had often , I had a topus with my professor , Richard Evan Shultes , the man who walked the psychedely , with his discovery of the hallucinogens in the 1930 in Mexico .
I think of my thesis not to be able to classify these tripster like hallucinogens because if you 're not going to tell anybody of being told . [ triptles ] . And triptles can 't be assumptiny because they 're money from a naturally , because they 're money from a naturally , who are denaturated in the intestine , detailed .
It 's possible to absume , if you just just taken up with other chemical substances that money the MAO .
Now it 's the beautiful : the queeequal that are injumps of MAO , the same kind of the same kind of potential , which is necessary to be able to be able to the tripsts . The question is , in a further of plants , like these popular people who are not , but that if you combine in this way , create biochemistry version that is sounds of the parts of the parts of the somall of the parts ?
We use the big eupherror , that can reveal , that can reveal .
But if we ask the Indians , they 'll tell us , " The plants are talking . "
What does it mean ?
This tribes , the Cofan , has 17 variety of ayahumps , that are nectively in the forest , and that our eyes would be going to in the same species .
If we asked him how they are saying , they 'll tell us , " I was thinking I was thinking about plants , " I thought I was going to say , " No . "
The solution is : you take the 17 variety in a night of a moon and each other , and each one cancer with a different .
With this doesn 't have a Harvard , but it 's much more interesting that count the stams .
Now , [ you open the problem is that even those of us who have to heart the population people who are found them in the paintoresthoresome , but in some reduced way to the history in our real world , and it 's pass .
In fact , the 20th century , between 300 years , it 's not remember for his wars or her innovations , but rather like the early that we were stopped , and we absolated activity , and we have been burn aby or accepted destruction of the biological diversity and cultural cultural diversity .
All of the cultures through the secoli were involved in a dance for new life .
And the problem is not technology .
The Indians Sioux didn 't stopped to be Sioux when they put out of an ark and flip as Americans don 't stop being American , when they put from horse and calved .
It 's not the change or technology that thnosal integrity . It 's the power . It 's the power .
The flight fly of the domination .
And if you look at the world , you 'll discover that these are not cultures that are not cultures to disappear .
They 're creatures and dynamics are creatures and dynamics that go beyond their ability to adapt .
Sweight that you can disboxed in the Patrit --
a populpulum in the Sarawak , in the Southest , a popular population , a popular population in the forest to a generation ago , and now reduced to the service and prostitution on the reserves of the rivers , where you can see the involved of the metheless of the Rornavi Merian Cinese Borneo Meridian Cinese Borneo the Merian , where the navi Borneo Meries , where the horrive the huge looks ,
you get the standing the standing wood with the such wood forest .
Or , in the case of Yanomami , are the diseases that are the diseases that are the diseases that are the disease of the golden .
If we move on the Tibet mountains of the Tibet , where I 'm doing many research , you 'll see the hard of the political domination .
As you know the genocide , the physical extinction of a population , it 's convicted to universal the lifetnocide , but the destruction of the lifetnocise , it 's not just convicted , but it 's not just cell , it 's a movements , because it makes strategy , because it makes strategy of development .
And you can 't understand the Tibet until you get the Tibet until you 're part of the beginning .
I lost the 6,000 miles from China in China in the Western Tibet Southeast , in the southeast , I went to a young connected , but only came to Lhasa I understand what we feel about .
6,000 sacres sacres in the willing and crazy .
1.2 million people killed by the military Chultural Revolution .
The father of this guy was at the Panchen Lama .
which means that it was killed to the template of Chinese invasion .
His , I was smot with Sua Sanity in the diaspora that he took the population in Nepal .
His mother been impresoned and his colpa was recognized .
It was brought to hidden in the age of two years , hidden under his gonna because he could not live without him .
The sister , who did the same , was in the field of reeducation .
One day , he walked a day a switched switch a switch , and it was mitted to the works for seven years .
The pain of Tibet can be insuit , but the rein the spirit of the population is present .
At the end , all you reduced a choice .
We want to live in the world of the monocromatical world or we want to get the policymicromatic policymatic diversity ?
The big anthropologogue Margaret Mead , before he die was that , in our greenhouse , in our going to go to this love the world , we will see the whole game of human imagination of human imagination , but one day we 'll see a modality of thinking , but one day we 'll be able to be a sonnailable .
And it 's umiliating our species has been for 60,000 years .
The Neolitical Rivolution , who gave us the agriculture , which did suck us into the seed cult of the seed cult , and we 're talking about the skies , creating the gerarchy of the specialization , and we talk about 10,000 years ago .
Smodern world industrialized has 300 years .
That 's a story doesn 't suggests that we have the answers that we 're going to all the challenges that we should get to millennia .
When you get these kind of cultures of the world is asked what we want to say to be human , they say with 10,000 voices .
And it 's in these answers that we all risky the possibility of being what we are : a consciously knowledge , that has to make all the people and all the people can truly transpores . And there are great moments of eight moments .
I took this picture on the northern extremity of the Baffin , when I went to hunt of the Balin the Inuit , and this man , Olaya , he tells me the wonderful story of his grandfather .
The canady was not always gentle with the Inuit and the 1950s to spend our , and in the 1950s to spend our , we have rink them in colonies .
The grandfather of this man refutated to go .
The family , teaching his life , and took them all the arms , and all his attitude .
You have to know that Inuit doesn 't themselves the cold ,
The batts of the sledge in the origin was made of cartoon the skin the skin .
The grandfather was intimise from the arctimise or the library that was suffing .
It 's gained , it 's calculated the pts in the skin in and defected in your hand . When the I did you have been congelated , he 's working on a mob .
He 's sprended on the door of this caccess , and when it became solid , he killed a dog .
He wasn 't the dog and created a bunch , with the cash cash , he created a sliterally , a slethes one more dog , and it 's disappeared on the balloon .
We want to talk about cavarsely with nothing ? [ I] And this , in different ways , [ Apaushi is the symbl of the resilience of the Inuit and all the people in the world .
In the 1999 , the canading canading the Issdied control of a larger area of a territory area of the greatest California and Texas a together together .
It 's their new patria . It 's called Nunavut .
It 's an independent territory . They all the minerary resources .
One splendido example of how a nation-state can remember with his population .
And finally , I think it 's quite obvious . I think it 's pretty obvious to the one of us was in these remote zone of the planet , remote that they are not remote remote .
For someone is home .
They represent sections of human imagination that are represent humans that are about the days of these children , like dreams of these children , like dreams of these kids , become part of the geography of hope .
Finally , we 're convinced that the politicians are convinced that politicians will never get to nothing .
We believe that polemiics --
[ Applauses ] they 're not persuasive , but we believe that stories can change the world , and maybe we are the best institution to tell the world , maybe we 're the best institution to tell the world . Every , our month of 35 million lives .
156 countries translated our television canal canal canal .
Our revilists are literally laughs from millions of people .
Our work is travel in the ethnosphere to bring our audience in places of wonders that they 're going to go away from how they 're going to the clever and hope , burn , they 'll be able to be in the central anthropology : the world of the deserves in the different , and we have to find one of life in a pluralistic world , and we need to find one of life in a pluralistic pluralistic .
where the wisdom of all the people can contributing our collective well-being .
Thank you .
I 'm going to talk about some of some things I wrote in this book that I hope you 've already heard and try to evidence some connections , in case not .
I want to start with what I call " the " " " " " " " " " " " "
The dogma official dogma of what ?
The dogma official dogma 's official dogma , the dogma official dogma recently : " If we want to massimilar to our citizens . " The way to do it is massive freedom . "
The reason is , from a mob in the fact that freedom is in the same a value , it 's useful , it 's useful , useful for human beings .
As the other is that if we 're free , each of us can act for all of us to do everything that massive , our well-being , without one that decided in our well-being ,
The way to massimilar to the freedom is massimilar the choice .
More choice , the people are free , and more than they are free , and more is their wealth , the major is their well-being .
This , I think , it 's so deeply radicated in society that no one would have to addoubt .
And it 's also deeply radical in our lives .
I 'm going to show you some examples of what progress has made possible .
This is my supermarket . It 's not particularly big .
I 'm going to permit on a simple note .
In my supermarket , there are 175 conditions , without the 10 oil variety of oil , and 12 aceps balsamic acepts that you can buy to you a huge number of conditions in the crowd circumstance that no one of the 175 constantly constantly , which no one of the 175 constantage .
Here is what the supermarket .
Then you go to the electronics to buy a stereo stereo , covers , radio , radio , radio , radio , radio , plag , radio , plag .
And in this single electronics , there 's a big number of audio components .
We can make six million and a half million combinations using the components that there are only one of a only store .
You 've got to admit that there 's a lot of choice .
Other , the world of the communications .
I was a little kid , when I was a kid , you could get all the phone services of the phone that they were forned by mom Bell .
It was wasn 't it .
A consequence of that , between the phone was that the telephone has never break .
These templates they went .
We now have a variety of telephones , especially between the phones .
Here 's the cell phones of the future .
My favorite is in the middle , MP3 , topes of the nose , and fornels , and forb to the burn crowd .
If you don 't even see it in the store under the home , you 're going to be able to get .
And what happens is that people enters are people enters and does this question . And you know , you know , what is the answer is " No . "
It 's not possible to buy a cell that it doesn 't make stuff too much .
So , in other aspects of life that are much more important than the aques , you true the same choice of choice .
Auge health care : it doesn 't happen in the United States that you walk from the doctor and the doctor and the doctor , you tell you what you have to do .
And you 're going to go to the doctor , and the doctor says , " OK , we could do . A , or B " Hok , " Big has these benefit and these risks " B " has these benefit . What do you want to do ? "
You say , " Does , what I should do ? "
And the doctor says , " As it has these benefit and these risks , and it has these benefits and these risks . "
" What do you want to do ? "
And you rebate , " Dootter if she was me , what would do ? "
And the doctor : " But I 'm not . "
The result of the result of the maled , expression that it seemed to look like a good thing .
But it 's not that a moving the weight and the responsibility of taking someone that knows the doctor , to someone else that nothing -- and almost certainly is sick -- and so it 's not in the ideal condition to take the patient decisions to take the patient decisions .
There 's a huge marketing products , direct direct to people like me and you , that if you think you don 't have any sense , because we can 't buy them .
But if we can 't buy them , why we 're public ?
The answer is that they want to do it to ask them to make them to make them the recipe .
Something that is our identity as our identity is a question of choice , as we see in this vision , " We don 't want to force the children . They 're going to ceat the right time . " We don 't see it a huge identity : We have to invent .
And we can reinvent how many times it .
which means that every morning , at the time , you have to decide that kind of person want to be .
Same the family and marriage , a time time , a common time , a common , almost for anyone , it was that he was that you could have the most soon as possible , and he started to make the most possible possible .
The only real choice was with who , not when you , and not when and not not when you 're going to do after .
At day , all day , all the time , it 's really to play .
I 'm going to teach very smart , and I 'm going to be at less than a time .
And not because they 're less bright , because they 're not because they 're under .
but why are they impensierites , I 'm going to ask , " Would I like to site or not ? "
" Would I have to think about it later ? I have to think before you , or the career ? "
They 're interrogatives .
And they 're trying to answer these questions , even if this implic implic not completely to the tasks that hear and you don 't get a good vote to my exame .
And they really have to do that . They 're important questions .
Now , the job : we 're lucky , like Carl was , because technology allows us to work every minute , every day , every single day , from the Hotel Randoll .
And in parentan , there 's a angle , and I 'm not going to tell you where the WiFi works works .
I don 't tell you , because I want to use it .
What it means , this incredible freedom of choice that we have about choice to work ? It 's continuously decide , if we have to work or no .
We can go to see our son playing , with the cell phone in a tax , the Blackberry in the other , and the notetetep , the guy on the gingerous .
And even though they 're all sorts of minute that we see our son rovement , we 're also asking the game , " I have to answer to this call ? "
" I have to answer this email ? I have to habitous ? "
And even when the answer is " no , all this makes the experience of your son 's boy , very different than what it would be in other conditions .
So , any part of the look at , small things , and large things , and large materials and life is a choice of choice .
Once the world was this : Ovalized , there were some possibility , but not all that was a choice of choice .
The world of today is a good thing , this is , " Is it a positive thing or negative ? "
The answer is Should you like to be able to be able to be .
We know all the sorts of all the way I 'm going to talk about the negative ones .
All this choice is two negative effects of the people .
The first , paradoxally , is that produces instead of liberation .
With the options of the options where you choose , it becomes very difficult to do it .
I 'm going to give you an example : a study conduct on the plans of volunteer pensionent .
A connection has had access to the data of Vanch data , the gigantic funding society of pension , with about a million clients imploved in 2,000 different companies .
What she discovered is that for every 10 solutions that are offered in more , the trade of adesion , the lower of two percent .
With 50 funding funding , there is 10 percent in less than adesions when they 're only about five . Why ?
Because with 50 funds that you choose , is sick , it 's sick to decide , and the choice is remainly difficult to the inmorrow .
And then , tomorrow , questions , questions , and of course , questions , and of course , I 'm not going to be .
You know , it doesn 't just mean that only it 's these old work for dogs , because they 're not going to be saying that the decision is so obstical that they also lose the decision is so obstical that they also lose the funding of complementary .
Don 't participating , they 're losing to five dollars for the year from the jobs of work , which would be well disspop .
So , the paralysis a consequence of having too many choices .
And I think it makes the world like this .
" And finally , for eternity : ketchup , ketchup , or maionese ? "
You want to take the decision , if it 's the right , if it 's for eternity , right ?
You don 't want to choose the wrong source , and no way , and it nepurpose the wrong .
So this is the first effect . The second is that we also have to avoid the paralysis , and then we 're going to do a choice , finally less than we were going to do with less options from the result of what we would have been with less options .
And this for different reasons .
One of these is that with many conditions in which you walk , if you buy a lot of you can buy a different choice , is that you could make a different choice that you could do a different choice that you could do a better choice . And what happens is that the alternative imagined us industry imagined us . And what happens is that the alternative to the crowed ,
And even when it was a good decision .
More choice , there are , the easier is easy to be dispioneer than any detail is the option of choice .
And also , there 's what economists call constitude .
Dan Gilbert really was like a very good stamateful statement that we do to depend on what we compared .
In the rest , when there are many options , it 's easy to represent the characternatives of the options of the options that are choice .
Here 's an example . I 've all got to be in New York .
But that 's what you probably think .
There 's this couple to the Hamptons .
A place of luses .
It 's behavior . It 's days . It 's all days . It 's all for them .
Not . But what he thinks is , " Well , malth , it 's Augly . "
" All my neighbors at Manhattan are away . "
" I could talk about front of the front of home . "
And it spend two weeks , from the idea that 's losing -- every day -- the chance to parking -- the chance to parking place where it wants .
The constery opportunity is decrease for what we have , even when the choice was the early thing that we have , even when the choice was a very cell .
And more are the options that we have to look , more the characteristics that you will come back to us against opportunity .
Here 's another example .
This is a lot of things tells us a lot of things .
It talks about living the moment , and maybe living slowly .
But the most important point is that any thing you choose , you choose to do not do other .
The things that we don 't choose are tactive attractive that can make less attractive what we do .
Thirst point : it 's a growing extatic .
I tried it on my skin skin in a new couple of jeans .
I 'm almost always purpose .
And once the jeans were just a kind of like , buy them and willing them , they were just moved , just after they were moved , just after they were moved , just after that , they were going to go well .
So , I went to buy a new when the old one was a new when the old ones were , and I said , " I need a couple of jeans , this is my wrong . "
The commit said , " He wants to slim , he wants to me , " As a fit ? "
He wants to them with the cernightons ? Stonewashed , " or " acached " or " acached ?
" Do you want them to be strapped ? "
" Soth them takes them large or blaw , " Buddge was blaw to elenenenenenencare .
I was saying , and after a little bit , and after a little bit I was able to say , " I want the kind of like , " I want the kind of , " I want everyone to me all the jeans , then I went out , I went out , and then the best couple of jeans that I had ever had .
It was the massive . And it was all the choice .
But I was hearing about .
Why ? I wrote a whole book to understand it .
The reason I was I was that with all that choice , I was that with all the alties , the jeans had to be perfect .
I was the beginning I was wait . I didn 't expect anything exceptional when it only existed only one kind of a kind of like , but when you saw 100 different .
What I was brought , but not perfect .
After I was talking to what I was trying to what I was trying to insatisfied in the compared .
The addition of options in the life of people don 't do that increases that these are responding to the options of the options itself .
And this will produce less satisfaction , even when the results are good .
Nobody in the world of marketing if you realize .
Because if you know , you wouldn 't know what I 'm talking about .
The truth looks more like this .
" The reason it was better when he was worse , " The reason it was better when he was worse , it was that when he was worse was worse , you can meet to meet .
And the world in the world that we live in -- opulents , industrialized , industrialized that we can hope is that we can hope is that things are at the height of expectations .
You never have surpries because your expectations , because your expectations , you 're ingigantic .
The secret of happiness -- what you 're here -- is , " Basse , " Yes , " Yes , you want . "
I mean , small autobiography -- that I 'm really sposed and my wife is really amazing .
I wouldn 't have to do better , I didn 't have to do better ,
But it 's not always a good thing .
finally , a consequence of the pair a couple of jeans is that when you 're just like that when you 're not satisfacts , and you ask you , " Why ? "
" Who 's responsible ? " The answer is clear .
The world is the responsible . What could I do you do ?
When you have hundreds of jeans , and you buy a little bit of jeans , and you ask you who is the responsible , it 's the responsible , it 's the responsible to , it 's a clear that responsible to you .
You should have do better .
With hundreds of available variety , there are no excuses for the unsuccess .
So when people take decisions , even if the result is a valid , they feel unsatisfacts and give the hits to them .
In the last years , depression is exploded in the industrialized world .
I think a significant factor -- not the only , but the only one , but important -- this wave of depression is that people have the deludent experiences because the standards are too altitude .
And when they have to explain this situation think that it 's them .
So the final result is that in general , we 're better , objectively , but we feel worse .
Let me remember you .
This is the official dogma , what we all take for good and it 's completely fake . It 's not true .
There 's no doubt that a little bit of choice is better than haven 't really really really good at it , but it doesn 't have a lot of choice is better than a little bit .
There 's a critical value , I don 't know what it is .
But I 'm sure that we 've done by a piece of the level where the choice are better than our life .
Now , from the political point of view -- I 've almost finished -- from political view , the nocce is the following .
What allows all this choice in the industrial society is the wealth material .
There are many places in the world , and you know about it , where the problem isn 't that they have too much choice .
The problem is that they 're too a little bit of it .
So the face of the challengd I 'm talking about is a sick of modern modern modern society .
And what it does to have to be this : Steve Levitt talked about how those expensive and the discovers of how those expensive and discovers are unuseful . It 's a spring of money .
I mean , that these choices , complicated and dispendous , it 's not that they 're just unuseful .
They 're in the eteries .
They do it worse or a little bit .
If a bit of what in our society allows were to choice to be reversed in those where people have too much pose , it would be not just their life to improve , but also our best .
This is what economists call a paretyan improvement .
A redistribution of the refined is all of the poor , not just to the poor -- because of this choice in excess that it comes back .
From , you can become everything that you want to become everything you want , "
You know , you want to think , " What 's creating what it 's creating ? "
" It 's obvious that you can 't make anything in a glass . "
" A imagination , a limited view of the world -- "
and I 've been interested in this , at the beginning .
But then , I realized that , instead , I realized that fish the long-going .
Because the reality of fact is that if you eat the boat , so that it 's possible , " you don 't get the freedom . You get the paralysis .
If you buy the ball the decrease possible to decrease the satisfaction .
You get the paralysis , and you 'll reduced the well-being .
Everybody needs a sphere .
This is almost certainly too , maybe even for the fish , and it 's certainly for us .
But the assn of some symolic symolic symolic sphere is a recipe for the bind .
Thank you very much heart .
