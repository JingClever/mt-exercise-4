I showed this year I showed these positive demonstrate arctical calculate that the glacial calculated , which for almost three million years had the United States continental , it 's recorded 40 percent .
But this subjects the gravity of the problem because it doesn 't show the spessor of the ice .
The articy glacial car , in a certain sense , the car heart of global climate system .
You expanding it and you get to extremely reverse .
The next next slide is going to be a quickly slide on the last 25 years .
The ice lost lost lost gets are red in red .
You see , you 're going to expand to the blue .
That 's the ice in inverny , that 's the inverinter .
You can see that the ice ice ice ice ice , five years or more , is like the blood , and it 's like the blood , which is like the blood here .
In 25 years , it 's been been so , at the time .
This is a problem because the interest in the tremendous terrain the ocean arctic where there are enormous amount of coal connected that , skip , snail that , snail are turned in microbes .
I respect to the totality of the atmospherical warming , that quantity could doubling , superperformance , superperformance .
In some laghes in Alaska , the metano is already rebuling from the water .
The Katey Walter 's professoresseversity of Alaska , I got a basis slow the scorce scorce the scorce .
Video : Wow ! Al Gore : Wow ! The question is if we 're going to be .
A reason is that this termal exchange that 's Greenland from the northermy .
This is a glacial reme .
He never took it to get to similar sleeping .
This is the Kangerlussuaq in the sud-eggs in the sud-eggs .
If you want to know how the level of the sea to the ice of the ice of the ice , here is where the sea .
These corrings are increasing rapidly .
Another part of the planet : Antarctttartttttars of the planet .
The month , the scientists have dichiate that the ice of the ice of the ice is in negative , and the Antarcttarttttarttticks , is particularly in the slapticularly , is particularly in the slaptops .
It 's six meters of the level , like Greenland .
Himalayas , the third biggest block of ice ice , you see new laghes , which few years ago were ice .
F40 percent of the world 's population was half of the population from the population .
Sulle Ande : this ice is the source of the powerful water of this city .
The ported it is increased .
But when it diminies , the same happens to the poable water .
In California , the Sierra Nevada is diminuit 's diminuit , 40 percent .
The backkkay , crisis .
The predictions , as you read , they 're graves .
The growth security is going to a night of the car incends .
The disasters are increasing environmental disappearing out of the normal and without precedental .
Four times as much as many number of years , in the last 30 years , I think about previous 75 .
This is a sustainable thing .
If you look at it in the storytelling if they can see the consequences .
In the last five years we 've added 70 million tons of CO2 every 24 hours -- 25 million tons of tons in the oceans every day .
Look at the Pacific area , from the American area , from the Americas , and both of the subcontinent , and both the parts of the subcontinent , where there 's a poor oxygen oceans .
The major causes , global warming , together to deforestation , which is the 20 percent of the fossil fuel .
The oil is a problem , and the coal is even worst .
The United States is one of the most emissions , together at China .
And they would proposed to build a lot of other coal .
But we 're seeing to a change direction .
These are the annoullated in the last few years and some projects of vernative alternative .
And every way , there 's a politician in our country .
The coal industry and oil have spent 250 million dollars in the last year to promoting carbon publishing the coal , which is a obsimulate .
I remember something --
I 'm going to go Natale , in Tennessee , where I live , there was a 3.8 billion literally .
Maybe you saw the news .
This is the biggest second flow of scories in America .
It happened around Natale .
The nature of one of the coal advertising of one of the carbon was this .
Video : Will the coal , Frosty , is a kind of allegry and happy .
It 's abundant here in America , and it 's growing our economy .
Frosty the carbon is and more and more published .
It 's good price , adorable and the workers and workers are the stypenddium .
Al Gore : From it 's a lot of the West Virginia .
The largest minerary societies is Massey Coal . This is his administrator .
Video : Don Blankenship : I 'm going to ask -- Al Gore , Nancy Pelosi , Harry Reid -- they don 't know what they 're talking about .
Al Gore : So the All of the Clima protection of Clima has launched two campaign .
This is one of them , one part .
Video : Actor : ALergy see the climate change as a threat the business .
So , our priority is to investing a great amount of money in a force public advertising and conflict the truth .
In fact , coal is not sports .
We think it 's a good way -- it 's also a good profum .
So , not preocupath of climate change .
Let me do it .
Video : Carbone , you know , you 've heard a lot of it .
So , you know , you know , a turn in a structure of the way .
Straordinary ! The machines are a little noise , but that 's the sound of the technology of coal technology .
The coal consumption is between the main global warming , but the night of the global warming , but the night that you see changes everything .
Take a look at : this is the coal technology of coal clean .
Al Gore : In the Gore : Finally positive , the positive issue is a lot of the national security .
Video : America is in America is in the crisis , the national security , the national security crisis .
The flows that the lines of all : our dependence from the fossil fuel , as the coal and the importantly oil .
Now , there 's a new , car , car solution for used to use it .
Repower America : 100 percent of clean energy in 10 years .
A to put America to work , make sure , make sure you get to stop the global warming .
Finally , a solution that burn our problems .
Repower America . Scover more .
Al Gore : This is the last .
Video : Comvice : It 's about reach energy to America .
One of the fastest ways to bring us to the end of the combustiable to kill our planet .
What it 's the future is here . I think , just a new energy , we 'll get a new energy .
What it 's two : Noves , we 've got to be bought .
Coming : Repower . It 's time to be realistic .
Al Gore : A old old African old African says , " If you want to go fast .
If you want to go away , you go together . "
We have to go away , quickly .
Thank you very much .
I 'm going to do this last year at TED .
And I promise to the car to the car .
So , here I did . And for the other time , there were no , the LHC is the biggest scientific experiment ever ever tented -- 27 miles of circumstood .
His to remember the conditions that were presents less than a billion a second , from the beginning of the universe -- until 600 million times a second .
All that 's just environment .
This is the machine under Ginevra .
We spent these mini-Bang mini-Bang mini-hand-out .
This is what I work . It 's called ATLAS -- it 's 44 feet , it has a 22 meters .
This is a spectacular picture of ATLAS in building so you can see the proportions .
The 10 September last year we have acceso the machine for the first time .
And this picture was taken by ATLAS .
It turns out to immense it in control the room .
It 's a picture of the first phasm of particles that had done everything the turn of the LHC , both in collision , with one part of the LHC , and spread particles in the remarker .
In other words , when we see that the picture 10 tember , we figure out that the car worked , which is a big vessels .
I don 't know if it was this to do exultent us to do this , when someone went to Google and saw that the beginning was this .
That means that we had a cultural impact beyond that scientific .
It 's a week after , there was a problem with the car , and it was a problem with the car here -- these damed drugs here -- these dored damed .
These files are 13,000 printing when the machine works at the massive machine .
Now , the technicians between you look at the kids and say , " It 's not true . They 're too much too much touch . "
And they can do it because when they 're very cold slights .
So , at less 271 degrees , at a temperature in the space between the stars , these floor in the stars , these floor .
In one of the most of the most of the nailable nailable magnetwork , there was a defect of fectors .
So the flows to go to six to six to go to the 13,000 printed resistance .
This was the result .
Now , this is even more impressive if you think that these magnetic fish fish , and that 's been switch , and that 's been switch of about 30 centimeters .
They 're saying about 50 magnetic .
We had to take them , what we did .
We repristined and repristed .
They 're all returning back to their place .
I mean the end of the LHC will be again .
We 'll accening it , and we expect to get to right now , and we 're going to go so our adventure to discover what are the morning that are constitude .
Now , of course , in a certain quarters , these accidents reaching the dibate on the value of science and engineering . It 's easy to confuture . It 's easy to confuture .
I think that 's so hard , the fact that it 's so hard to go beyond the value of things like the LHC .
I want to end with the words of a Inglaugh , Humprey Davy Davy , which , the defense , which , in defense of his own puplease , his puple was Michael Faraday , he said , " Nichael Faraday , said , " Nichael , " I think that 's not measures , and our months that there are not measures in our monitself , and our monsters in the monsters in the monkey . "
Thank you .
I want to start asking you to start to start to start to play in the morning .
And you understand how to get them and to get them and to get them , and move them , and move them , and then you learn in fact , and you can actually think of problems and manipulating relationships .
The space is deeply connected to the way we understand the way we understand most of the world around us .
So , from information to the push of our interaction with physical objects , with my conflict on Patts , and my collaborator Jeevan Kalanithi , I started asking , " And if we use a computer , instead of having the only cursor as a digital polluts that you can have to have a little bit of the mouse , we could actually deploy-bysick information with the both of the monkey ,
and we sistemarmy to do ?
The question was so interesting that we decided to explore the answer , building the Siftable .
In a few words , a Siftable , a Siften interactive computer .
In a few words , a Siftable , a Siften interactive computer .
You can move them with the hand , they can see the hand , they can see the movement and a radio screen and a radio wireless .
But basically , I 'm photos , like the morning , you can just move to simply further .
The Siften is the example of a new ecosystem tools to manipulate the digital information .
And as they get more physical , conscious , of the other people , and as they get more physical , and as they become more physical , of how we move , we can explore new and different styles of interaction .
I 'll start with some simple example .
This Siftable is to show the video : if you 're going to show it in a direction , the video race is so if you 're going to figure out the other side back .
These interactive riting ritriting are conscious of others .
If I floor , they 're interested in what they 're going to them .
If they 're surrounded , they 're looking at it and they can act a little bit .
If they 're surrounded , they 're looking at it and they can act a little bit .
They also have their movement and inclination .
We then realized that one of the interesting implications of the interaction was the power of the interaction , for example , " to put " a color like it , if it was a liquid .
In this case , we have three Siftable as a secks of true and I can use them to figure out out the color in the central , where they mispoints .
and I can use them to fix them in the central color in that central , where they mispoints are .
If we 're too much , we can put a little bit about it .
They also are beautiful possibility to apprinted , like languages , the math and games of logical things where people can try and see the results of things , and see the results .
I 'm going to --
This is a Fibonacks that I do with a equations of equations .
Here we have a game of words that 's half in Scarabeo and Boggle .
Pratically , at every turn to a letter in a case on every Siftable , Pratically , at every turn , and you get a letter on every Siftable , and while certain who 's going to control him on a display .
Then , after about 30 seconds , you have a new set of letters and new possibility to try to try .
Thank you .
Here 's the kids came in the Media Lab , I made it and I made it and turned a video .
They were very much .
And one of the interesting things about this kind of application is that you have to have to be able to give people many education .
You have to say , " Compones of words , and they know exactly what to do .
Here 's the other people who try it .
This is our texture , the younger test there on the right there .
It actually wanted to just impact them .
They were only morning .
Now , this is an interactive application of a interactive application .
We wanted to build a tool for the apprintices of the Lui is Felix .
It can insert new characters in the scene , just slightly to them .
It can insert new characters in the scene , just slightly to them .
So , it 's doing the sun .
Video : The sun is source .
David Merrill : Now he took a tractor in the scene .
Video : The arange arancient .
I work ! Yeah ! Yeah .
So I school the Siftable and put it in the neighbors can interact the characters --
Video : Bau !
-- by by by inventing their story .
Video : Ciao !
DM : It 's a final story with the opened , and he can decide him as it fly .
DM : It 's a final story with the opened , and he can decide him as it fly .
Video : Voly : Volice .
DM : The last example I have the time to show you is a tool , realized by the way to sample and execececures .
it 's a tool , recently , to willing and execececk music .
The Siftable here are coming from suund like base , basically , basically and the bacteria .
Each one of these has four different variations , and you can choose what using .
You can also get these suons in a sequence to buy your floor .
And it just just to take a suund , and a " sequence . "
These are actually that you can control from the vive , as the reverbs and the movie .
I 'm going to a particular sound and then including it .
And then there are the general effects as time and fly , and you want to get to the entire sequence .
We look at how it works .
Video : DM : We 're going to put a base in two Siftable , we 're going to put in a series , we 're going to address , we address .
I put a basis of basically .
Video : DM : Now I added some percussions --
Video : And I 'm going to put the filter battery , so I can control the effect from the vive .
Video : DM : I can quence the whole sequence inclining the whole sequence .
Video : And I 'm going to add the movie to get the basis to give more expression .
Video : DM : I can recombine the sequence . "
So I didn 't have to plan the first , but I can improvision , make it longer or more cord .
And now , finally , I can do I think of the whole sequence inclining to the left Siftable .
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is building new interface , it 's building new interface as the way our brain work .
And today , I 've had time to show you one of the results of this performance , and some possibility that we try to bring out the lab .
The concept I want to transmit is coming in this new generation of objects for digital media , which will bring information in our world , in our world in the way we want .
Thank you very much .
I don 't see the time to talk to all of you .
I 'm a written written .
I 'm going to write books is my profession , but it 's more than that ,
It 's also love the love and the fashing of my life .
And I don 't expect to change .
But I said this , something particular happened in my life and my career , and in my career , which took me to remember the whole thing .
The particular thing is I recently written this book , this biography called Manges , Prega , Ama , " which , the most of my own books , for some reason that , for some reason was used in the world and become a big sensatisational , balades .
And the result is that everywhere , people treat me as if I were condannated .
Do -- condanned , condanned .
They 're now going to me to all worry and say , " Don 't you fear to be able to do it ?
You don 't have to be written to write for all life without power to be able to create a book that can be able to create a book that can 't be somebody ? "
that can be important somebody ? "
It 's safety , you know .
But it could go worse , I remember that over 20 years ago , when I started to say to people -- I was a adolescent -- I was a writing .
I went to meeting the same reaction of the fear .
And people said , " Don 't told me , " Don 't have success ?
Don 't you fear that the humiliation of killed you ?
Don 't you fear to do this for all life without the nothing that nothing is that you ever get out and deaths on a date , and you 're going to dead with the both of the falliment to love clean to high up ? "
So , you know .
The answer -- the short answer to all these questions is , " Yeah . "
Yes , I have fear of all those things .
I 've always had fear .
And I also learned about many other things that people could not have to have to deal .
As the algaxy and other things .
But , as I look at the same as I thought , and I was asked to ask me , why ?
Is it . Is it ?
It 's logical that anyone who 's going to waiting to be spent by a job that you 've got born to do .
But what 's there is so particularly in the drives to make us nervous health of health health in a way that other career do they do ?
As my dad , for example , he was a chemical engineer and I don 't think about one time in his 40 years of activity where the was asked if he was fear to be engineer ?
It was never -- that block of the engineer John , how do it ?
Don 't work that , you know ?
Onestly , chemicals as a group don 't certainly have certainly , in the chemidddle , drives the reputation of being high maniaces .
We have been writers , we have enough this reputation , not only writers , but creative to every kind of reputation , we have this reputation of being huseful instable to be hustable .
And it doesn 't know that look at the sad of the magnificent deaths of the magnificent minds that , only in the ventury , they died young and often .
And the ones that don 't have suicipate data , they 're actually disfactory by their texten .
Norman Mailer , before I died , in the last interview said , " Each my book has killed a little more . " A straining a little more . " A further of the work of life .
But we don 't bley when we feel that because we 've heard these things , because we 've heard these things that we completely interized and accepted the notion that creativity and suffering is somehow and suffering is somehow you do it , and it 's going to be able to the ancious .
And the question I want to take all of this idea is : you 're right now : you 're right now , you know ?
I 'm going to do this -- because it also looks at a house of distance to me not good for anything .
I think it 's odioxious .
And I think it 's even dangerous and I don 't want to see the perpetuated in the next century .
I think it 's better encourage our big creative minds to live .
And I know that , in my case -- it would be very dangerous to start figure out out to start figure out out the way I 'm in my career .
I mean , I 'm just looking at the time , they 're pretty young , I 've been about 40 years .
I still have about four decades in me .
And it 's very likely to be able to be judge in the world as the work that was coming out of the world as the work that was going to be able to my last book .
I 'm going to be slavery , because we 're all about the largest in the mies of my biggest .
Oh , Gesus , who think .
You know this is the kind of thinking about it that leads a person to start bind a person to start bind ban .
I would keep to continue to continue to do this work that we love .
So the question is , how do it , how ?
And so it seems , after many reflections , that the way to continue to write is to write is to create a psycholgical push , right ?
I have to make some way to find a security between me , which I 'm written , and my natural anxiety on which is written to get . And as I was trying to all the time , as I was looking at the time , looking at the time , trying to find other society to see if they could have society to see if they could have better ideas and more sane .
about how to help people create creative inherents .
And that search me on the Great and ancient Rome .
I 'm going to drive me in certain and then back .
In the ancient Great and ancient -- people don 't seem to believe that creativity was to believe that creativity was , OK ?
And it was creativity to be this spirit about the divine and that was saying , and that was saying , for reasons , for reasons , for reasons and unknown .
The greehouse gets told , the gathering of creativity . "
Sococcurred , wonderful , he created to have a demon that wisdom wisdom .
The Romans were the same idea , but they call that kind of spirit a genius .
And the way , because the Romanious , because the Romanium didn 't really think that a genius was really bad .
They have a genius was this kind of a divine that had been lived in the walls of the study of an artist , a little bit like the elfy Dobby , and that came out to assisting to the work of the artist of the work , and model the result of that work .
And it 's a distance of -- that 's the distance of which I talk about -- that 's the psychological that you 're protext-protext-achieved results of your work .
And they all knew that was so that it worked , right ?
So the antients were protected by certain things , as for example , as for example , as for example , not ?
If your work was exceptional work was exceptionally you couldn 't take it all the goodd , everybody who were helped by this genius .
If your fallide work , it wasn 't all your , right ?
They all knew that was your genius to be a incapable .
And so people han concept in the creativity in the West .
Then the Rinascivvvanced and all changed , and we put this big idea ; we put the human being in the center of the universe and mistes and mistes and without leaving space to the midddd-up and measures that they writing from divinity .
This was the print of humanity and people started thinking about it , and people started thinking about creativity , and they were completely from the idividouth .
And for the first time in history , you start to referred to this or that artist as a kind of a rather than one person .
And I have to tell you , I think that was a herror .
I think that allow someone , a simple person to believe that 's as a recipent as the source , and the source of all the divines , inosconcertain-house , inosconfidence , and a responsible to the human-fragile human-human-human-human-human-human-human-human-human-humans .
It 's how to ask somebody to ingoes .
As a shapes and completely the ego and creates all of these inextremely waitable .
And I think it was this pressure to address in the past 500 years .
And if that 's true , and I think that 's the question , and now ?
We can do it different ?
Maybe back to a more ancient understanding of the relationship between humans and mistery .
Or maybe not .
Maybe we can 't sell 500 years of thinking in a talk about 18 minutes .
And there 's people who are the public that would be lawymeless , scientific notion of the notion of , insom , do you do people , or you do it , or you do it , or failure their projects .
I 'm not going to convince you about this thing .
But the question I would like to take it -- why not ?
Why not think that way ?
Because it 's more sense of everything else that ever ever heard to explain the exasperformance of the creative process .
A process that , as anyone who ever ever tented to do something -- so , basically , all here -- it 's not buy .
And in fact , it can sometimes seem to look completely paranormal .
I did this meeting with the extraordinary poetesse Ruth Stone , who has now 90 years , but it was a few of all life and told me that during his childhood in the Virginia , working out in the Virginia , working out in the fields , and he was in the poem .
And he said that was like a fragorous trends .
And that was rotating toward her from the landscape .
He was to feel that , because he was tremendous to the land under his feet .
He knew to have one thing to do at that point and it was about , he 's words like a matter . "
And so it goes towards and sitting from this poem , and it wouldn 't have to make a piece of paper and a math enough , as the traphic , as the traphic , and he would take it and deal on the page .
Sometimes you couldn 't get enough fastly , so that it goes and it would go into the home and poetry was going to go in home and she was going to go through the landscape and she would continue to rotolar through the landscape , and he would keep up through the landscape . "
And then there were those times -- this piece of the piece , I 'm going to do there , there were moments where the almost losing , OK ?
So , he was running to the home and he was trying to see the paper and the poem was going through , and then he was going to go through the hand he was going on , and then he said , that was like you slow with the hand the hand the floor .
He was the poem from the tail and she was put it in his body and turned on the page .
And in these cases , the poem was going to be presented on perfect page and the last word at the first word .
So when I thought -- it 's a crazy , it 's exactly equal to my creative process .
I don 't have a creative process -- I 'm not a condition .
I 'm a mulo , and my way to work is , and I wake up to the same orary every day and get to work and go and go and go and go and go and go and go and go and go and go and go and go and go and go and go and go and go and go and go and go and go and go and go and go and go and go and go and go and go and go and go and go and go and go and go and go and go and go and go and go and go and go and go and go and go and go and go and go and go and go and go and go and go and go and go and go and go and
But even I , in my head , I have striked against that thing , sometimes .
And I think that also many of you have this .
You know , even if the work and ideas came to me give me a certain source you can 't know , you know ,
What is this thing ?
And how can we relationto it , but , how do we do not let the head , but , rather , rather , that do you get us to remain ?
So , as I think , the best example of the best example I have is the Tom Waits , which I interviewed in Tom Waits , which I interviewed in a day .
We were talking about this , and you know , Tom , for most of the life was the incarnation of the artist went back , trying to control , by trying to control , by trying to control , to reach these species of inhyzes .
But then I reverse , he got it , and one day as she was driving on a car Los Angeles , changed everything for him .
He was going to go fast and all of a sent , this little bit of a melodia , which comes in his head , and it 's saying , it 's very wonderful , and the wants , you know , it 's wonderful , and it wants , you know , it 's not as it .
It doesn 't have a piece of paper , it doesn 't have a math .
So it starts to feel this kind of old anxiety growing in him like , " I 'm going to lose , and I 'm going to lose it from this song .
I 'm not enough and I can 't do it . "
And instead of going to go in the panic , they stop .
I 'm going to do the whole process , and he made something completely new .
He just looked at the sky and said , " Don 't see I won 't see I 'm driving ? "
" To seem to be wrong to write a song hour ?
If you really want to exist , you know , it 's a more opports when I can take care of you .
Otherwise , I won to do anything else today .
I went to disturbing Leonard Cohen . "
And his process , he was changed after this .
I don 't work , the work was still dark as well as a always .
But the process , and the fish that was that was require when the genius , the genius that was coming , the genius that was out of him , and it was remaintain it back where it was , by by doing it , and I remained .
but it 's just a lot of it , wonderful , bizarre a conversation between Tom and this strange , and this strange , and external that 's not Tom .
So how much that story I think about changing a little bit even even the way I worked and already to save me a time .
This idea , I was going to writing " Mangap , Prega , Ama , and caddress in one of those cause disperation that we 're working on something and we can 't start thinking about something and we can 't start thinking about it , and we can 't start thinking about something and we can 't start thinking about it .
Not only bad , just the worst book written .
And I started thinking about gait .
But then I remember Tom that talked about the air and I tried to do it .
So you zoom in in the managed and I realized my common in the room .
And I said to high , " Sends , what do we know if this book not will be brilliant not going to be interest in my , not going to be a bright ?
Because as I 'm going to put it out what I have , I don 't have more than this .
So if you want it to be better , you have to pressure and make your part .
OK . But if you don 't know what , I don 't do .
I 'm going to write the same because it 's my work .
And I want to do it for me to do my part of the world today , I 've got to do my part of the North , it 's so , OK -- it 's the deserts of Africa , the people were sought for the killon , dances and music sacra and music and the sacra , and the hours .
And they always were magnific , because the balloeres , and they were wonderful .
But every long , rarely , something happened , and one of these artists was actually transendent .
And I know what I 'm talking about , because I know you have seen that you have seen , at a certain point , a performance so .
It was like the time it stop , and the balloon the ballery walked through a kind of driver and wasn 't doing anything else from the usual , but it was all sorts of it , but all the way it was slow .
And suddenly , not appears as a human .
But it turns out to the divinity in the fire of the divinity .
And when this was happening , the people who knew what was called her his name .
They know the hands and started cancer , " Allah , Allah , Allah , Allah , God . "
That 's God , you know .
Curiosa knows -- when the More invading the South of South , preserved this habits and floor changed in the check of " Allah , Allah , Allah , " Allah , " Ole , " the words , " which you can still feel in the corride or flaming .
In Spain , when a artist has done something impossible and magic , " Allah , words , " Allah , " Allah , " I was , " ununderstandable , " I 'm going to understand , " I 'm going to go back , " On God .
And it 's great because we need it .
But the problem is coming the day after the ballery , when you wake up and find that they 're the 11 morning of Martedly Martedly , and I 'm going to go out .
It 's just a mortal with balloy to the ginoccurred , and maybe it will never come to that already already to that altitude .
And maybe nobody will switch the name of God still as it 's going to do with the rest of his life ?
It 's hard .
This is one of the most pain recognizations to make in a creative life .
But maybe it 's not to be so angoes to be so angoes not to believe , indeed , that the most extraordinary aspects of your being from you .
But you just think that 's a source of this source of this source of this squisity part of your life that you have to have to get to somebody else when you finished .
And , you know , if we think it 's all changing .
And so I started thinking about , and it 's certainly as I thought , as I thought , I 'm just as well as I thought I 'm going to publishing , the dangerous , I 'm going to do it , spent , I 'm going to follow my great success .
And what I have to continue to tell me when I feel electricated by this is , not having .
Not to scale . It 's just your work .
It 's a deal of your part , whatever it can be .
If your work is balance , balance .
If the divine , likely you light-assigned decide to let me go to switch some kind of wonderful , for just a moment through your sforces , then " Ole ! "
You know , I do the same your dance .
And " Ole ! "
I think and I think it 's going to teach it .
" Ole ! " at yourself , even just to get a human-head of tal human-t-taken tal humans to get you to get you continue .
Thank you .
Thank you .
June Cohen : Ole !
You know , I 've been talking about some of these projects on the human genome , what it can meaning and new set of new genes .
We 're starting a new way : we started digitalizing the biology and now to start to start to start to start to start to digital biology , we 're entering in a new phase of biology , design and synthetizing and synthetizing .
We always tried to bring large questions .
" What is the life ? " It 's something that many biologists I think they have tented to understand livels .
We tried different approaches , reduced to the terms .
We 're digitalizing from almost 20 years .
When we sequenced the human genome was going to spend from the analogical world of the biology in the digital world .
Now we 're asking : We can regenerate life from this digital universe ?
This is the map of a small organism , the Mycoplasma genitalium , which is the species from the smallest genitalium , which can autoreum in the lab .
And we tried to reduce the genome to create a little bit smaller .
We 're able to eliminate a hundred genes of about 500 that are here .
But when we take a look at his metabolic maps , it 's relatively simple respect to our .
I think that 's simple .
But when we look at all the genes that we can eliminate , one at the time , is very improbable that this can bring a living cells .
So , we decided that the only way to provide the way to provide this cromosome of the things that we can get to bring some of these fundamental questions .
So we started the " Pomosom , we can synthetize a cromosome ? "
It can be able to produce these big molecules that we never could make these big molecules that we never never have been able to create before ?
And in case , we can make a cromosome , we can make a cromosome ?
A cromosome is simply a piece of chemist material .
The speed that we 're able to digitalize life is growing exponential .
We our ability to write the genetic code , instead , procreated , rather , but it 's doing it .
And our most recent results the branch a tremendous curve .
We started over 15 years ago .
The process has requires a lot of pass , starting with a bioetic review before we started the first experiments .
But we found out that DNA synthetize is very difficult .
There are tens of thousands of a car segments in the world that are producing small segment of DNA , the longer segment , and it 's a degenerative process : the longer is long , the more herrors .
So we had to develop a new method to assembly these framments and correct the herrors .
And this was our first tentative , to start information information by the digital genome of Phi X 174 .
It 's a little bit of bacteria that kills .
We designed the fragments , actually , the correction of errors and get a molecule of DNA , about 5,000 letters .
The interesting part is when we took this piece of chemical material chemical material , and we put it in the bacteria , batters have started to read this genetic and protected in the viral particles .
The viral particles have been returned out from cell , they 're back and destroyed the Ecoli .
I 've talked about recently with membrings of the oil industry saying that they have certainly compressed that they have certainly compressed .
They remember more than you .
We think this is a situation where the software can actually build his hardware in a biological system .
But we wanted to do things in larger .
We wanted to build the whole cromosome of the bacterium .
They 're over 580 miles to be genetic lectiny .
So we thought about building it in the casses of the virus , so that we could change the casses to change what the components of a living cells .
The design is crucial , and if we start with digital information in a computer , these have to be very accurate .
When we sequencaman accurate for the first time in 1995 accuratess was a herror for every 10 miles .
We found , resequency , 30 herrors . If we used that original sequence . If we used that original sequence , we would never be able to work .
One part of the process is to design segments that they have to be survive for all the other segments of 50 lective longer to build up .
We try to go to the only one here .
You probably have read that we read that we put in the field .
Think about four , we have a genetic code on four lettliers : A , C , and To .
Three of those letters together with about 20 minoacids , and there 's a specific order to be a particular order to the lectal minoacious .
So we can use the genetic code to write words , fralmost , psync .
What we did at the beginning was autogography .
Some of them were in the fact that it wasn 't a poem .
We designed these segments to just unable to be just to uninentist .
There are the enjoy and put them together .
And we started to assembly , starting with segments from segments , by five to segments , to make it segments to form segments of 24 mile lecton to get to 72 mies .
So , every step we 've produced these in abundance , so that we 're trying to create a extremendous process , as you 'll see in a minute .
We 're trying to automatize the process .
So , this seems the tabellon a basket .
When we get to these very long time , more than 100 miles , over 100 miles , they 're not going to grow more directly in the Ecoli .
You get to the limit of the modern tools of the molecular biology .
So we 've been considered to other mechanisms .
We know , one other mechanism called recombination , which is actually used to repair DNA to repair the DNA can une the segments .
Here 's an example .
This organism , called Deinococcus radioduring three million rad .
You can see in the superior like his romosome beyond , like his chromosome .
In 12 -- 24 hours is reassembled exactly how before .
There are thousands of organisms that are able to do it .
These organisms you can sat completely seck .
They can live under vacuum .
They 're absolutely certainly , life in space , and you could find new reserve environments of water .
In fact , NASA showed that this happens .
This is a picture of the molecule that we built with these processes , just using the lifetime with design appropriate .
The clean assemble them automatically .
This picture was not taken with a microscope , but with a microscope , but with a microscope .
It 's a lot of the big molecule that we can see it with a microscope .
These are pictures that they cover a six of about six seconds .
This is the publishing that we did little time ago .
They 're over 580,000 letters of genetic code .
It 's the largest molecule of a defined defined structure that man 's ever created by man .
It 's a weight molecular high 300 million .
If we stammed it with a 10 without spaces , we would just like 142 pages to turn this genetic code .
Now , how do we do it work ?
Of course , I think , a virus is a game .
It 's a little more complicated when they use the bacteria .
It 's easier when it 's as much eucariote as our : you can just extract the nucleus to get the nucleus and inserious , which is basically the clonation of clonation .
In the archaea , the cell cell is instead of instead , but we have recently demonstrated that we 're able to do a transplant of a cell , and we 've got to do a transplant of a cell and activity .
We can refed a cromosome from a microbial species .
The two are different as the men from the tops .
We added some gene more than we could decide where to choose to choose for this cromosome .
And then the sciolden with the way to kill all the protein .
And when we put it in the cell was stupid -- and you 're going to oppreciate our suppmosome of the cell .
And we really thought we could not go beyond , but we tried to spinging it in the slum .
This is one of the major mechanisms .
We found that a lot of a lot of a third or a third cromosome of a high hundreds of a thousands of new tracts to that species .
So who think about evolution as a only gene at the time that modies don 't understand most of biology .
And they 're called the restription of restription that in the DNA .
The cromosome that was in the cells don 't have one .
The cell phone that we have inserit-cell cell .
And it 's expressed , and it recognized the other romosome as expensive material , and we were ritted with only the cell and the new cromosome .
it blue because of the genes we put in .
And in a short time , all the caracteristics of a kind of went to perx , and it turns out to be a new species , based on the new software that we put in the new cell .
All the proteins are changed , the membraning is changed , and when we read the genetic code of what we 've spent ef exactly what we 've spent .
Now , this might seem alchemy genetic , but it 's going to be a software , and we can change things in a sustaining enough .
Now , I 've already explained that here is not talking about genesis -- but we 're going to start to start from three million years and a half years of evolution , and I said that maybe we 're going to create new version of the Cambrian explosion of the species that will come up to the digital species .
Why do that ?
I think it 's enough obvious when we think of our needs .
We 're going to spend from six billion and a half billion in the next 40 years .
Right to give an example : I was born in 1946 .
Now , there are three people on the planet for each existing in 1946 , there will be four .
We 're having problems now to find food , fresh water and clean and walking , and benzooom and a half billion people .
It 's going to be more driving to it for nine billion .
We use more than five billion coal , over 30 billion baries .
That means millions of baries a day .
When we try to find biological processes , or whatever we try to get them , it 's going to be a huge challenge .
We have to tener the whole emission of CO2 from these materials that end up in the atmosphere .
At day , thank you to scientific discoveries all the world , we have a database with about 20 million genes , and I like to think that are the designed of the future .
The electronics that is only a dozen about a dozen about components , and think of how many different things are coming out .
Our limits here are maplently by biological reality and our imagination .
Now we have techniques , thank these methods of synthetization , we can create what we call genomics combinatory .
We 're able to build a big robot that can produce a million cromosome day .
Think of them to be able to provide these 20 million different genes or to try to make either optimize the processes to produce either either , and we can change , thank , and create more biology , and create more biology , and create more biology , and create more biology .
And it 's just a standard selection .
We can choose for possibility of survival , chemicals , chemicals , production of vaccine , etc .
This is an instantaneous instantaneous instantaneous programmed on that we 're working for being able to seat and design species .
Well , we don 't know necessarily , how they 're going to be .
We know exactly what they 're genetic code .
We 're concentrating on the fuel of those generation .
You also saw you who experiment from the grate was a bad finished finished .
We have fuel of the second and third generation that will use enough to be ready for the higher than than the high value as the either or different kinds of butanol .
But the only way the biology that can have a big impact without increase without increase more impact the cost of food and limited the world 's going to transform CO2 in matter , we 're working on to design CO2 in matter , we 're working to design cells that can be achieved to design this , and we think we could have the first coal of these generation in about 18 months .
The sunlight slightly with CO2 is a methodown-methodown-discoveries .
This is a organism that we have described in 1996 .
It 's in the ocean deep , about 2500 feet of deep ebullifetime to the temperature of water .
They 're out of CO2 using molecular hydrogen as well as you 're going to be energy .
We 're trying to figure out if we can indow the CO2 , which can actually be transported by the way , convertising that CO2 in the midddle , to drive this process .
So , as we think we might be able to increase what we 're able to increase what the question of the base question , and we have the result of the goal -- we have the modness of the goal to reduce the oil industry .
Exactly . If you don 't do it from TED , where you can ?
It would be a main source of energy .
We 're working to use the same methods to create vaccines .
You see this year with the influence , we 're always back to a year and a dollar in less when it 's actually actually , it 's going to find the right right .
I think that that you can change building vaccines in combining .
Here 's how the future could start to look like changing , now , the tree of evolution , accelerating the tree evolution with bacteria , argue , and you end eucariote .
We 're so that we 're going to improve people .
Our purpose is to be able to try to try to try to make it . Thank you very much .
I 'll show you , the most rapidly possible , some fundamental work , some fundamental work , which we took to put the Microsoft in following a year ago exactly . This is Seadragon .
It 's a a environment that you can interact is in the local level that remote with an enormous amount of data .
We 're seeing a lot of digital photographs with a kind of photos , and continuous , for a panoramic speed , and it 's a panoramic sponing , disponing the images of how we want .
And it doesn 't matter how big the amount of information that we see , how big these are the data or the images .
Most of the photographs , but this is a scanning scanning from the Bioooooooooth-megaxel .
It doesn 't make any difference because the only thing that the prestations of a system like this is the number of player on your screen in your screen in any time . It 's also a very flexxxxessible .
This is a whole book , example of data not not images .
This is the Dickens , Dickens . Each colonna represents a chapter .
And to show you that it 's just about tree , and not images , we can do something like that , to make a real thing that 's a real representation of the text , not a photograph .
It could be a bit artificial way to read a bunch books .
I don 't think it 's about it .
This is an example more realistic . It 's a number of the Wardian .
Every big picture is the beginning of a section .
And it really gives you the pleasure and beautiful experience to read the version of a revision or a quotidian , which is for nature , which is to nature a moltle .
We also did something with the corner of this particular number of the Guardian .
We created a fashion advertising -- much more higher than that you use in a normal advertising -- and we put you in the normal advertising .
If you want to see the careful cars , you can see it here .
Or other models , or even the specific techniques .
And this really demonstrates of these ideas to eliminate the limits of space on the screen .
We hope that that that means to put the pop-up and other porcheries like , you don 't have to be necessary .
Of course , the mapplications is one of the most obvious applications for this kind of technology .
And on this is not going to lose time , if not to say we have contributes to give in this field .
These are all the streets in the USA super-sudden phonto the NASA .
So now we go to something else .
This is now actually from the Web on the Web ; you can go to see it .
It 's a project called Photosynth , which combine two different technologies .
A is Seadragon and the other is a visual research in the computer , very interesting research from Noah Snavely , a student of Washington , with Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Szeliski .
And it 's from the Web , I realive from Seadragon .
You can see it when we do this kind of pattern , where we can go from a picture to another and have this kind of experience and have this kind of experience .
But the space of the pictures here actually has a meaning meaningful meaning .
The algorithms of visualization , the computer recorresponding these pictures , so that they corresponding to the recorresponding to the place that -- all of the picture of the Grasks on the Montagne Rocal Montagne Roctopped -- so the hand-stand-stand-stand-stand-stand-standing things , and these things are all the space of the space of the colleagues .
I don 't know if I have time to show you some other environment .
There are some more space .
I want to spend up one of the original data of Noahhhhimself -- and this is from a prototype of Photosynnnnth that we did for the first time the extremely scorce -- to show you what 's really the key is the key , technology , Photosymptotypes of the world . And it 's not necessarily , looking at the environments we 've put in the site environments that we 've got in the site environments we 've got in the site .
We had to worry about laws and so on .
This is a reconstruction of Notre Dame images from Flickr Dame , in Flickr , in Flickr , and you get images of the maglights in the maglights , other fields of the maglights , other field of these arancient arancient .
So , they 're all pictures from Flickr and they were all linked at the space level in this way .
And it 's possible to navigate this way simple .
You know , I 'd never thought I would never think about finish for Microsoft .
It 's very gratification to remember this kind of account here .
I think you can see that it 's a lot of different kinds of different kinds of phones that are in the phones of the phones in the professional SLR , a significant significant , put in this environment .
And if I 'm going to try to look for those strange .
Many of them are block , except .
Some of it 's a series of photographs -- and that 's a number of it .
This is a Notre Notre Dame recorrectly correcorrectly .
We can go from the poster to the physics of this environment .
The essential point is that we can do things with social environment . This is taking data from the college memory of how the Earth 's visual , from visual perspective -- and you know , and you all those data together .
All those pictures become linked together , greater than the sum of the parts .
You have a model of the Earth 's the whole thing that emerges .
Think about this as a such of Stephen Lawler on Earth .
It 's something that growing in complexity as people who use it , and the antages to grow the use .
Their pictures are marbage with other people .
If somebody 's idea of the idea of meet these saying the name , my picture of Notre Notre Dame improviously , you get to get out of all those data , and I can use as a dominal point to immerger in that space , in that metaphing , in that metaphing , and have a lot of a cross-model social experience of cross-moda and red social experience of the cross-moot-like cross-moot-like cross-mooth .
Of course , a consequence of all that are virtual model of any interesting part of the Earth , and it doesn 't just just take you to see an airplane and satellitaries and satellitarians and similar , but from the college of college .
Thank you very much .
Chris Anderson : I understand ? What your software going to do is that you know , in the next few years , in the next years , all the photographs , all the photographs in the entire world will be basically colleaged together ?
AA : Yeah . What it 's doing in basically discover .
It 's creating hyperlink , if you want , between images .
And it 's doing it in the basis in the content of the images .
The thing becomes very interesting if you think about the receptures of the semantic information that many of these images .
As you do a research of images on the Web , you digit on the Web page has a lot of information about the picture .
Now , what 's happening if that pictures you connected to all your picture ?
So the amount of interconnected and the amount of the result of it , and the amount of the network .
CA : Blaise , it 's really incredible . Compums .
AA : I thank you very much .
One of the main pileap when you travel and one of the research of the ethnographics is the power of living in the pointing , between the past , the past in the wind , the wind , the wind , the wind , it 's driving in the floating , it 's driving in the floating plants .
And the idea that the Jaguar travel even even the Via Lattea , or that the mites of the Inuit 's still tranthrow , or that the Himalayas , the good people who are still in the Dharm , to remember the world , to remember the central anthrow , and the idea that the world that we live in assume , but it 's just a model of reality , but it 's just a model of reality ,
the consequence of a particular set of choices that our stris done , well , or a lot of generations ago .
And , of course , we all share of the essential tracts .
We all go . We all procreating .
We are subjects .
We have to deather the inexorability of death , so it doesn 't surprise and ballie .
We all have a art .
What it flows is the particular rhythm , the dance of every culture .
Not matter that they 're the think of the forest Borneo , or the following Vodoo Haiti , or the Deerriririers , or the Kaisut in Kaisut in Kenya , or a wod-bya , or a woddddle in the Sahara .
He was my journey in the desert a month ago , or a high hyak , or a hyak hasize , the Everest , the mother of the world .
All these people teaching us that there are other ways of exists of exists of thinking , other ways of music in the world .
And if you reflect a second , it 's a concept that can give you hope .
Insized , the world 's cultures of the world creating a spiritual life of the world , cultual and cultual that 's important to the planet and it 's important to the well-being as the planet as the way the ragnature .
And you can think about this cultural raging as a a ethnossphere , and you can define the ethnosphere , the total of all the concepts , dreams , inspiration , inspiration , inspiations , inspiration , inspiration , inspiration ,
The etnossphere is the patrimonium of humanity .
It 's the symbol of what we are and what we can be in as inquisitive .
And because the biosphere was free , as a very quickly , as it was a lot more rapidly .
No biologist , for example , it would say that 50 percent of all the species was , or is on the horge of the extinction , because it 's falready -- in the most apocalypothesis -- and you don 't even even closer to the most optimistic , and you can 't even even even even even even even near , the most optimistic of the section .
The index of all that is , of course , the loss of language .
When you 're born existed 6,000 languages on this planet .
A language is not only composed by a vocabulary or a series of rules .
A language is the spraper of the human spirit .
It 's the middle of every culture is coming in the material world .
Each language is a forest of the mind , a little bit of spiritual possibility .
And of those 6,000 languages , as we sat at Monterey , at least half the midddle of children .
They don 't get to teach kids , which means , at less you know , not wouldn 't figure out something , which are already dead .
What 's the sought of being the silence , the last silence , to talk a language , not having a language , not so to transmit the wisdom of the promidddle of the children ?
This is a horring in some part of the world every two weeks : every two weeks , one of the older weeks are moving and brings in the tomber , the syllabs of a ancient language .
And I know somebody who will say , " Don 't it better ?
The world wouldn 't be a better place if we 're going to leave all the same language ? " Well , we 're talking about it . We talk to everybody .
Let 's talk knew .
You know , a tract thing that means not to talk about your language .
I would like to do a journey through the ethnossphere --
a little journey in the etnossphere to give you a assage of what we 're losing .
Many of us forget that when I say , " different ways of existing really different ways of existing existing .
Take for example , this baby Barasana , in Amazon , the popular stouriders , which crees the myth of proof , to come from the latte of the swalking of the site of the site .
It 's a popular that 's not able to distinct the blue because the blue time , it 's a cell floor , which depends on the forest , which depends the popular popular .
They have a strange language and a world , detes , detes " " " " You have to know , you have to tell you a different language .
All that 's radical in the past past , yet the particularity is that in these families that are talking about six or seven language of seven language .
They 're all the way to listening and then they start talking about .
We take one of the most interesting tribes that I lived , the Waorani Waorani , the Waorld Ecuador , a popular that has had the first contact in 1958 .
In 1957 , five missionary missionary , they 've tented a common .
They did come from the high photographed them in a few who were in a few who were populating , forgotten that this population of the forest of the forest .
They 've been told the ground of the Earth , they turned to the research of a form or a figure out , and not find nothing , they 've got out of the distry , and they killed the five missionary .
But the Waorani don 't just killed to the straneiers .
They killed to them .
The 54 percent of the mortality was caused by their same .
We 're saying , at eight generations and we found two cases of natural death and when we switched to know , they have a tremendous one of them was indeed , and then they killed it .
The cters were able to recognize the animal urine , and recognize the species .
In the early 1980s , I was assigned a very interesting tasks when my Harvard 's professor , I asked me if I wanted to go to Haiti in the intruspites to the power of Duvalier and Tonton Macoutes , and I can imslate in the speed of the speed Duvalier and I imming the speed of the speed of the speed of the speed of the power of Duvalie , and I would have been asked to do it .
To give a sense of miracy , I would have to understand the Vodoun culture and that Vodoun 't magnine .
It 's pretty much of a complex metaphysical complex of the world .
Very interesting .
If I ask you to tell me the big religions of the world , what would you say ?
Christianesimum , Islam , Budddism , etc .
A continent is always left out , thinking that 's thinking about sub-Saharan Africa has not been religious . And instead of these religious concepts , and Vodoo is not the distilled by these religious concepts of these religious concepts in the waiting of the slavery .
What makes the voodoor is the intense is the report between life and death .
So the people do they have to hire the spirits .
The spirits can be invited by Great Aqua , they respect to the dance of dance and they replace in the soul , and they replace to be the way to be the way to be the following it becomes the next to the following goes .
So , the voodoodists , they say , " You know , white you asked to talk about God .
We saying in the temple and divention the temple and God . "
And from the moment that you 're sitting you , is the spirit that you 're doing you , as you can do you do the bad ?
So you 're looking at these incredible events : following voodoor in the state of trance that touch a demonstration rather stration , rather strong the power of the power when it was cataled in a state of extreme , when it 's cataled in a state of extreme extreme .
I 've been the most extraordinary of the most extraordinary are the Kogi of Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta , in Colombia .
Take the ancient civilization that once they live the planning of Colombia in the wills of the conquirst , the popular popular , the popular path , the popular planture .
In a drug drug , this popular , this popular was never conquirst by spaggeres .
It 's now now , from a cler-hery , but their formation is actually extraordinary .
The young people are taken by the families three or four years , and they live secreated in a world made of good and homes in a world made of base and hit in the base of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice , the ice of the ice of the ice , the base of the ice , the base of the ice , and they live in a world made of the base of the base of the ice , and they live in a world in a world fact that they have been became out of the base of the ice for 18 years .
Two draw nine years of the proposition to reproduce the nine months of gestation that turns out to the user of the mother , now are metaphically in the user of the Great Mther .
So , that 's all of time , they get accultured to their society , values that they predict their predict and just their predict , and just the cool of the cool ecological .
At termine of this incredible beginning , they 're sudden outside and for the first time in 18 years , they see a 18 years , they see a high . And in that account of the first wrong values , when the sun backyes , when the sun beautiful beautiful , everything they 've learned in the splay , all of the beautiful behind . The predict is a favor . The predict driving , and he says ,
" I 'm going to do you ? I 'm told you .
It 's stupendent . I 'm going to protect it . "
They call it larger brothers and say that we , fraction mines , we 're the colpatterns of destruction of the world .
This level of intuition is extremely important .
When we think of the indeed and the environment , we 're in the environment , which is a razy , which is a concept in his simplicity or perhaps in the simple of the neighbor , and we say that these populations are closer to the Earth .
The people who are not sental indebules , not inbulites from the nostalogy .
There 's no space for these things in the paluures of the Aststststage , but because of the Tibet , but because of the time and the ritual , they created a mistic Earth 's not on the concept of being known in the concept of being in the world .
What does it mean ?
I mean , that a boy of the Ande that growing the mountain is a spirit Apu that the mountain is a spirit of the mountain , it will be a different destiny , and it 's going to be a different , and it 's going to be a different , and it 's going to be switch , and it 's a fun of a mountain of the Montana who grew up a mountain of being swahead .
What 's the dimage of a mineral or a mineral mineral was irrifying .
What 's interesting is the metaphor that defines the report between the individual world .
I grew up in the forest of the Columbia cred-credying that forests the forest to be touched .
That was a different human being in a different from my friends Kwakiutl that believe that the forests are the Hukuk , and the storytells of the paradise and the stories of the paradise and the downballows that live in the northern world , explaining during the world , spiritual beginning .
If you start to look at that these cultures can create different reality , you can start to understand some of their sensational sensational discoveries .
I 've been taken this picture to open in the nordocccipinside .
Mayahuash some of you have heard of the ayahuash , the most powerful summmer repertoial repertoial repertoial repertoial repertoial repertoial repertoial repertoial repertoial repertoilet .
What makes the ayahuashuashuash is not the physical potential of the sustainance , but her election . It 's two two elements .
It 's a hand , this liana law that 's a series of quickly , harmine and harmine , slightly hallucinogenes , slightly .
Take the only plant , you have a blue that alters a little bit of consciousness , but it 's mixed with the leaving of a family , the Psychotridis said , " The coffee , " Psychotridis .
This is a sad powerful powerful sads , very similar to the serotonin the midd-ptamine-five , methyltryptamines .
If you 're going to see the Yanomami to get on the nass , they 're doing from a different set of species , anchously contains methoxyltryptamine .
Tiring that polls on the nass is a bit like being spared by a spared sly-pink sparked . And we can 't believe a distortion of the bear .
I had often with my professor , Richard Evan Shultes , the man who waiting the man was psychephysical fungi in Mexico .
I think my tesis , you can 't classify these triptamines like because if you 're not going to tell any of being told .
It 's possible to sumerely if you 're just going to be in other summming that money in MAO .
Now , the beautiful : the beautiful : the Poline ine injur , the same kind of MAO , the same kind of potential , the same kind of potential , as the question is , in a spontaneous 80,000 species of plants , like these popular popular , as they 're not , but that if you combine in this way , create a biochemical version that 's summmer in the world ?
We use the great euit of proof and error , which can reveal it .
But if we ask the Indians , they 'll tell us , " The plants talk . "
What does it mean ?
This tribes , the Cofan , 17 varieties of ayahuash , which are nectely in the forest , and our eyes will return in the same species .
If we asked him how they 're going to stage their tasonomy , they 'll tell us , " I thought I would not know about it ? " I said , " No . "
The solution is : they take the 17 varieties in a night of the bunch of the blocks .
With this doesn 't have been slaughter to Harvard , but it 's much more interesting to contact stami .
Now , [ it ] the problem is that even the ones of us who have to heart populations in the world 's populations are pitting them , but in some way reduced to the margins of history in our real world , and it 's almost .
In fact , the 20th century , between 300 years , it 's not remembered for his drives or its technologies , but rather like the was where we stopped and we have stopped and we used to stop the destruction of the biological diversity and cultural diversity of the planet . Now the problem is not the problem .
All of the cultures through the secles have been involved in a dance for new possibility of life .
And the problem is not technology .
The Indians Sioux don 't have to be Sioux when they put from the areas , and they flowed as Americans don 't stop being Americans when they put from the horse and hot .
It 's not the change or technology that threatening integrity . It 's the power .
The hard fly of the domination .
And if you look at the world , you 'll find that these are not cultures that these are not cultures .
They 're creatures and dynamics out of identific forces that are almost of identify forces that are beyond their ability .
The patria of disboxes in the pen-dent .
a popular notion in Sarawak , in the sud-asian populous populous , and you can see the forest in the forest to a generation , and now reduced to the service and prostitution on the resements of the rivers , where you can see the hume of the light-half of the riverse , where you can see the flows that we can see the free free .
It takes the stage to refloor the forest to the forest .
Or in the case of Yanomami , are the diseases that are the diseases that are coming with the discovered of those .
If we 're going to move on the Tibet , where I 'm doing many research , you 'll see the hard of political domination .
As you know the genocide , physical extinction of a popular , it 's condannoced , but the ethnocide , destyle , not only is not only conditions , not only is conditions , but it 's not only in the world , but it 's a certain environments , because it 's part of the strategy of the development .
And you can 't understand the Tibet , until you 're not part of the beginning .
I lost the 6,000 miles from China in China , in the Western Tibet Souoriental , coming to Lhasa with a young , but only came to Lhasa , I realized what we feel .
6,000 sacres reduced in polls and cenjoy .
1.2 million people killed by the military military people are going to the Cultural Rivolution .
The dad of this guy was ascritical at Panchen Lama .
The means that it was killed to the template of Chinese invasion .
I 'm going to know , I was in Santity in the waiting that has taken the popular in Nepal .
His mother was impresoned and his colpattern was being recognize .
It was taken to a couple of two years old borders in the age of two years old nose because it wouldn 't live without him .
The sister , which made the same , was put in reeducation .
One day has been walked a dasn 't a raffuring raffuring a raffering , for this transgression , was mitted to the forces of seven years .
The Tibet of Tibet can be insuit , but the spirit of the popular is from the popular .
At the end , all you reduce a choice .
We want to live in the world monocromatical world or we want to take across the world policicromatic of the diversity ?
The big anthropologiogs Margaret Mead , before he said that his greatest wake was that , in our moving towards this , not only we 'll see the whole garm of human imagination , we 'll see the whole gares of the imagination of the world , but one day we 'll be swake up from a sone-minded of a sonce .
And it 's umiliating our species is existed for 60,000 years .
The Neolitical Revolution , who given us the agriculture , which made us to fight us to the seed of the seme of the sler , they 're making the poem of the scientist of the specialization , and we talk about 10,000 years ago .
The modern industrialized world has been 300 years .
That 's a story not suggests that we have the answers that we have to all the slowly challenges that we 're going to deal with the millenny to come .
When these myries of cultures of the world is asked what to say to be human , " they say to be human , they say with 10,000 different voices .
And it 's in these answers that we all risk the possibility to be what we 're : a conscious species , which has to make all the people and all the gardes can figure out . And there are great moments of optimism .
I 've been taken this picture on the northy of the island , when I went to cut honin the high of the Enuit , and this man , Olaya , he told me the wonderful story of his grandfather .
The Ennoon the Enuit , it 's not always gentleming the Inuit and in the 1950s to stage our super-to-stuck .
The grandfather than this man refuted to go .
The family , I temention , and all his life , and all his own reaching .
You have to know that the Inuit don 't temust cold , the switch .
The sliterally brought in origin was made of fish in the days of carrying in the skin .
The grandfather , he didn 't intimidd-night or from the libraries , or from the libraries that they were driving .
It 's gap away , it 's calculated the skin in skin in in focused in the hand defected in the hand . When I got it , you 've been connected , creating a lama .
It 's sprined on the dots of this caccess and when I became solid , he killed a dog .
It 's swaves the dog and created a bridle , with the household , has created a sliterally , and it 's bought to the banker , and it 's bought on the banker ,
We want to talk about that ?
In the 1999 , the canady government sandied in the Inuit , the total control of a larger area of the larger California and Texas .
It 's their new patria . It 's called Nunavut .
It 's a territory territory . They know all the mineraries .
One splendido of how a nation-state can remember with his popular popular .
And , to finish , I think it 's pretty obvious at least who of us in these remote zone of us in these remote zone of the planet , remote that are not remote .
For somebody is home .
They represent human imagination that are human-t-high high . And for us all , the dreams of these kids , as the dreams of these kids , becomes part of our kids , become part of the hopeful geography .
Finally , we 're convinced , we 're convinced that politicians don 't get to nothing .
We think the polemies --
[ Applauses ] don 't have persuasive , but we think that the stories can change the world , and maybe we 're the best institution to tell stories in the world . Ogen month . Each mention our site .
156 countries transmit our television .
Our revilians are literally literally .
Our work is travel in the etnosphere to take our public place in the world 's wonderful , where they go away away from the cut as they 're going to be able to be able to be able to the central revelation of the world , and we have to find a central revelation of the world , and we have to find a lifetist in the world , and we have to find a lifetist in world .
where the wisdom of all the people can contribute to our well-being .
Thank you .
I 'm going to talk about some things I wrote in this book that I hope you 've heard of it , and I 'll try to try to make some links , in case not them .
I want to start with what I call " the dogma official .
The official dogma is what ?
The official dogma of all the West , the dogma dogma official dogma , " If we want to massive benefit , " If we want to massive to do it , " The way to do is massimilar to do it ,
The reason is , from a hyourself , in fact that freedom is in the value , is precious , it 's precious , in fact , humans .
The other is in the fact that if we 're free , each of us can act for their own well-being , and without any that we 're going to do all the nobody that decided in nobody that decided in nor .
The way to massimilar the freedom is massive to choice .
More choices people have , more are free , and greater is their own .
This , I think , is so deeply readiced in society that nobody would summmit would be to doubt .
And it 's also deeply readiced in our lives .
I 'm going to show you some examples of what progress has been possible .
This is my supermarket . It 's not particularly big .
I allowed a simple note on the conditions .
In my supermarket , there are 175 conditions , without content the 10 varieties of oil and 12 hundred holive and 12 hundred balsamic aceages that nobody of the 175 already ready ready ready ready ready ready ready ready to be your degree .
Here 's what the supermarket .
And then you go to the electronics to buy a stereo , range , basically , radio , radio , piag , piag , piag .
And in this single negoties of electronics , there 's a big number of components .
We can make six million and a half a different slightly using the components that there are only in a goties .
You have to admit that there 's a lot of choice .
And the camps : the world of the communications .
As a time , when I was a kid , they could get all the wish , you could get all the wish , and in the pat that they were momb from momb mom Bell .
He was to explain the phone , you didn 't buy it .
An the consequence of that , was that the telephone was that the phone had never roped .
These days have gone .
We have a lot of almost limited phones , especially between the phones .
Here 's the phones of the future .
My favorite , the MP3 , wrong , the MP3 , cut , and foreign in the high , and foreign in the high .
If you don 't have seen it in the store in the home , you 're going to get certain that you 're going to get .
And what 's going on is that people enters in the store and the question . And you know , what is the answer ? The answer is " No . "
It 's not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn 't do it too much .
So , in other aspects of life that are much more important than the budings , it 's the same explosion of choices .
Audge , health , it doesn 't happen in the United States that you go to the doctor and doctor , the doctor , what you have to do .
Instead , you go to the doctor , and the doctor says , " OK , we could do A , or B , or B , " has these benefits . " And these " B has these benefits . " Where do you want to do ? "
You say , " Dottore , what I should do ? "
And the doctor says , " As this gathering and these risks , and these benefits . "
" What do you want to do ? "
And you rebecame it , " Dottore if she was me , what would you do ? "
And the doctor , " But I don 't . "
The result of the result of the maleting , expression that it looks like a beautiful thing .
But actually , it 's not that a post-pound and responsibility to take somebody who knows about , which is doctor , somebody else knows -- and so almost of it 's not -- and so almost certainly , it 's not in the ideal condition to take the ideal decisions of the patient .
There 's a huge marketing of products , drug people like me and you , and you , if you think , it 's not a sense , because we can 't buy them .
But if we can 't buy them , why do they public them ?
The answer is that they want to do we call the doctor to ask them to make us to make it recipe .
Some of that fundamental as our identity is a question of choice , as you see in this vision , as you see in this vision , " We don 't want to prove children to be able to be able to prove kids .
And we can reinventing how many times we agges .
The that means that every morning , at the time , you have to decide that kind of person wants to be .
I 'm going to spect the family and matrimonium , a common time , almost of the common , it was that you could do the most extremendous , and he was that he was going to make the most as possible .
The only green choice was with who , not when and not even when it , and even less what to do after .
And it 's really to play .
I teach students very intelligent , and I think about 20 percent of work , and I think about the time .
And not because they 're less brilliant , not because they 're less diligents .
but why are they impensierites , I mean , I should wouldn 't you know , or not ? "
" Would I think about it ? I have to think before the or the career ? "
They 're logoring .
And they 're trying to answer these questions , even though this implessy not completed the tasks that you 're sitting in my examples .
And they really must do it . They 're important questions .
Now , the work : we 're lucky , as Carl such , because it allows us to work every minute , every day , every day , every day from the angle of the planet , and every single of the planet , in the world , from the Hotel Randolph .
It 's in parentances , and I 'm not going to tell you what , where the WiFi works .
I don 't tell you , because I want to use it .
What does this incredible freedom of choice we have about the work ? It 's that we have to keep , and then , if we have to work or not .
We can go to see our son , playing calculate in a tasks , the Blackberry in the other , and the noteteteam , and the noteteteam .
And even though they 're all spents , every minute that we see our child , we 're also asking the partnership , we 're also asking , " Do answer this called ? "
" I have to say to this email ? I have to habboze this letter ? "
And even when the answer is " no , all of this makes the experience of your child-toy , very different from what it would be in other conditions .
So , from any part of the things , small things , and large materials and large materials and lifestyle , life is a question of choices .
Once the world was this : Obly , there were some possibility , but not all was a question of choice .
The world of today is this : The dilemma is , " Is it a positive thing , or negative ? "
The answer is , it 's Shicle .
The positive we all know it , so I 'm going to talk about the neglectops .
All this choice two negative effects of people .
The first , paradoxiously , is that it produces instead of liberation .
With options of the options that choose , becomes very difficult to do it .
I 'm going to give you an example , a study of volunteer plans .
A link of my colleaged data in Vanic data , the giant society of the source of pension , with about a million clients in 2,000 different companies .
What she found out is that for every 10 solutions that are offered in more , the percentage of the floor of the floor two percent .
With 50 source of offering , there 's 10 percent in less adesions of adesions , because ?
Because with 50 source of the bottom of them , is hard to decide , and choice is to go to the questions .
And then the questions , and again , questions , questions , and of course , and questions , and of course , and questions don 't get .
You know , it doesn 't mean only that these workers are going to be saying , because they 're not going to have enough money , it also , it also means that the decision is that they lose the funding is so ostic that they lose the source of work .
Not participating , they 're losing to five to a year from the dator of work , which would be bought to be disposed to true .
So the paralysis a consequence of the tropps .
And I think it makes the world .
" And finish , for the ethernity : ketchup , senapes or maionese ? "
You just want to take the right decision , if it 's for the right , right ?
You don 't want to choose the wrong source , and you don 't want to choose the wrong became .
So this is the first effect . The second is that we can get to avoid the paralysis , and do a choice , at the end of how we would have been with less options of how we would be in the result of what we would have been in with less than the result of what I would choose .
And that for several reasons .
One of these is that with many conditions that the choose who choose , if you buy , and it 's not perfect , is to imagine that you would have been able to do a different choice that you would have been better . And what 's going on is that the alternative imagined , and the remain the driver of the choice , and the rehern , and the reduce the ddge of the decision ,
And even when it was a very good decision .
More choices , the most is easy to dispilepleasure that it 's inseveral is insuit of the choice .
Also , there 's what economists call constood called constood .
Dan Gilbert asked a lot of things like the value we 're going to depends on what we 're depends on what we 're in in frontiers .
In the rest , when there are many options , it 's a very easily represent the carteristic willing , and be less sitting and be less sitting out .
Here 's an example . I school with all the ones that are not in New York .
But that 's what you probably think .
There 's this couple to Hamptons .
It 's a sluser .
It 's splendida . Ottic day . It 's all about them .
Not nothing . But what he think about is , " Well , malth , it 's Agoddge . "
" All my neighbors at Manhattan is forth . "
" I could talk to them to do right in front of the home . "
And it spend two weeks , from the idea that 's losing -- every day -- the possibility of parking where it wants .
The constood is decrease the sudden , even when the choice was old .
And the most are the options that we have to think , more the characteristic action is going to be able to be meeting .
Here 's another example .
This vigneptells us a lot of things .
We talk about the moment , and maybe the living slowly .
But the most important point is that whatever you choose , you 're going to do not doing other .
The things that we don 't choose are tactives that they can make less attractive what we do .
Tirst point : it 's a growing of waiting .
I tried it on my skin beating a new couple of jeans .
I 'm almost always jeans .
As the jeans were only one of them , buy them and walking out and walking from besty , they were dissimulated , just after they brought them a lot of times , they started to go well .
So , I went to buy a new when the old old old old those old old old old were , and I said , " I need a couple of jeans , this is my wrong . "
The committed me , " Li wants to slim , fit 's relaxed to the fit ? "
I want to do it with the bottom ? " Stonewashed , " or " Adwashed " ?
" Do you want to strapply ? "
" Sotto them want to be a blue , " Bla blue the bla -- " Continuit .
I was sitting , and after a little bit , I mean , I want to say , " I want the kind of like , " I want to know what it was , so for a hour , I tried to try all the jeans , and then used the jeans , and then the best jeans , and then I had ever had .
It was the massive . I thought I 'd get the better better .
But I felt worse .
Why ? I wrote a whole book to understand it .
The reason I was worse is that with all the choice of the waiting for the myself of the jeans were very high , jeans had to be perfect .
I was going to do that , I was waiting . I didn 't expect anything exceptionally when it 's just a kind of a kind , but when I live 100 different , at least a kind of a kind of a lot of be perfect .
What I was buy , but not perfect .
After I had compared that choose with what I was trying to involved in the waiting .
The addition of the people in life doesn 't make people that increase expectures that they have respect to the old options .
And this will produce less sweet , even when the results are good .
Nobody in the world of marketing if it connected .
Because if they knew it , you wouldn 't know what I 'm talking about .
The truth looks like this .
" And he was better when he was worse , " The reason it was worse , when he was worse , it was that when he was worse , it was possible to meet to meet the surprisly .
And in the world that we live in the world , we live -- opulents , industrialized citizens with the perpection of perfefeeling -- the massive we can hope is that the altitudes .
You never have surprised to be in your expectations , because your waitable , they 're ingiant .
The secret of happiness -- what you 're here -- is , " Basse , " Basse , " Yes , you want . "
I mean -- small autobiographical moment -- which is really hard and my wife is really stupid .
I didn 't have to do better , I don 't have accounted .
But it 's not always a good thing .
And finally , a consequence of jeans , when you 're just that kind of jeans is that when you 're not sitting , and you ask you , and you ask you , " Why ? "
" Who is responsible ? " " " The answer is clear .
The world is the responsible . What might I do you do ?
When there are hundreds of jeans , and you buy a slide , and you ask you who 's the responsible , it 's the responsible , it 's as well as well as well as a clear that responsible .
You would have been able to do better .
With hundreds of available , there are not screen for the unsuccess .
So when people take decisions , even if the result is , they 're salid , they feel insuit , they 're sitting and sleeping the same .
In the last few years , the depression is exploded in the industrialized world .
I think a significant factor -- not the only , but important -- that 's the only important , but -- of this honto depression is that people have extremendous experiences because the standard are too high .
And when they must explain this situation think that the colcollished is their own .
So the final result is that we 're in general , we 're better , but we feel worse .
Let me remember .
This is the dogma official , what we all take for good and it 's completely falready .
There 's no doubt that a little bit of choice is better than having not not having it , but that 's not sell it 's better than a little bit .
There 's a critical value , magic value . I don 't know what it is .
But I 'm sure we 've been supered by a piece of the level where the best choices best .
Now , from political point of view , I 've almost finishing -- from political point of view , the noccipe is the following .
What allows all this choice in industrial societies is the recheness .
There are many places in the world , and you know about it , where the problem isn 't that they have too much choice .
The problem is that they have too little bit too .
So the face of the facilities I 'm talking about is a murdern of modern , remember societies .
And what it does to have to get and arrand is this : Steve Levitt talked about how those constood and discovers to be useful .
I mean these choices , complicated and dispendispendious , it 's not just inuseful .
They 're in the eterious .
They do it to be worse .
If a bit of what in our societies allows , it 's reversed in those where people are too few possibility , it wouldn 't just be the lifetime .
This is what the economists call a paretian improving paretian .
A redistribution of the redistribution is good at all -- not just to the poor -- because of this choice in excess that we go back .
And to conclude , " Well , you can become everything that you want to become everything that you want --
You know , people think , you think , " What about that fish ? "
" It 's obvious that you can 't make it in a glass . "
" A castrated imagination , a limited of the world --
and I 'm interested in this , at the beginning .
But then , think about it , instead , I realized that the fish known known .
Because the reality of the fact is that if you manda in frantums , so that , " all you can 't get the freedom . You get the paralysis .
If you get the bocks in a way that all you can decrease decrease .
You get the paralysis , and you 'll reduced the well-being .
They all need a sphere .
This is almost certainly too , maybe even for the fish , perhaps even for the fish , and certainly for us .
But the absence of some symbooks , is a recipe for infection and , for the rovement .
Thank you very much .
