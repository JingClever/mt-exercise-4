Last year , I showed these slides to demonstrate that the glacial warm , which for almost three million years has had the size of 48 million years have had the United States of 48 percent of the United States .
However , that is the gravity of the problem because it doesn 't show the ice of the ice .
The glacial calots is , in a way , the clear heart of the global climate system .
It expands of the winter and the summer .
The next slide is going to be a rapid of the last 25 years .
The ice lost lost have signed in red .
As you see , they expanded up until the blue .
That 's the ice in the winter , which you can make summer .
You can see that the cosidis lost of five years or more , than five years , it 's like the blood , which is like the blood here .
In 25 years , it 's gone .
This is a problem because the warming is a problem because the glacier around the ocean , where there are enormous amount of coal coal that , which , scientists , they 're transformed into the microbes .
I spect to the totality of the atmospheric of global warming , that amount of global warming , that amount of global pollution .
In some laghi lams in Alaska , the methane is already rebulating from the water .
The professored Katey Walter of Alaska , the University of Alaska bunch of the University .
Video : Wow ! Al Gore : That 's good . The question is , if we 're going to be .
A reason is that this term is that this terms of the Groenland from the northern .
This is a glacial river .
The brought her levels .
This is the Kangerlussuaq , in the Southeast Greenland .
If you want to know how to the sea level of the melting of the melting of the sea , here is where it reaches the sea .
These corrates are increasing quickly .
On the other side of the planet .
The last month last month , the scientists have clear that the balance of the ice is in the negative , and the Antarctica , which is particularly rapid islands , which is particularly rapid .
There 's six meters of lies , like Greenland , like in Greenland .
On Himalayas , the biggest block of ice , you can see new laghi lay , which a few years ago were glacier .
40 percent of the world 's population was half of the world 's population half of the world 's population .
Sulle Ande : this glacier is the source of the water source of this city .
It 's increased .
But when it decreases , the same is happening in the water .
In California , the snow on the Sierra Nevway is 40 percent .
The crisis in crisis .
The predictions , like you read , are graves .
The powerful growing in the world leads to a remarkable car of incendes .
The environmental disaster environmental disaster .
Four times as a number of times in the last 30 years than 75 years of previous 75 .
This is all unsustainable .
If you look at it in the historical consequences .
In the last five years we 've added 70 million tons of CO2 every 24 hours -- 25 million tons of tons in the oceans every day .
Loately look at the East area of Pacific Eastern , to America , in the west both , and on both the parts of the subcontinent , where there 's a radical radical oxygen in the oceans .
Most of the global warming , together to deforestation , which is 20 percent of them is the use of fossils .
The oil is a problem , and coal is even worse .
The United States is one of two countries with more emissions , together to China .
And it was proposed to build a lot of coal .
But we 're seeing a change of direction .
These are the annoullated projects in the last few years and some alternatives .
Anyway , there 's a political fight in our country .
The coal and oil industries have spent 250 million dollars in the last year to promoting coal clear , which is an oxymold .
And this image was reminds me something --
Natal , in Tennessee , where I live , there was a 3.8 billion liters .
Maybe you saw on the news .
This is the second biggest flow of scories in America .
It 's happened around Natal .
The natural advertising of one of the coal industries was this .
Video : Without carbon , it 's a kind of alleger and happy .
It 's abundant here in America , and growing our economy .
Frosty carbon is increasingly clean .
It 's a good price , adorable , and the worker and the workers are stunning .
Al Gore : From here is a lot of the West Virginia .
The biggest minary society is Massey Coal . This is his administrator .
Video : Don Blankenship : I 'll be clear -- Al Gore , Nancy Pelosi , Harry Reid -- they don 't know what they 're talking about .
Al Gore : So the Alance for the Clima of Clima has launched two campaign .
This is one of them .
Video : All COLergy see the COLergy see the climate change as a threat to our business .
So our priority is to invest a great amount of money in a effort of money in a effort to make public and confused the truth .
Actually , coal is not sports .
We think it 's clear -- it 's also a good .
So you don 't pay climate change .
Let me make us .
Video : Carbon : Carbone , you 've heard a lot of it .
So let 's take a turn to a turn into a structure of the coal of clean .
Straordinary ! The machines are a little noise , but this is the sound of the technology of clean .
coal consumption is between main global causes of global warming , but the remarkable technology of coal warming that you see changes everything .
Let 's look at this : this is the odieral technology of clear .
Al Gore : Finally , the positive alternative connects to economics and the national safety .
Video : Comment : America is in crisis ; the national security , national security ,
The line that all of us : our dependence that all of us : our fossil fuels , like coal and oil .
Now , though , there 's a new , car solution for using it .
Repower America : 100 percent clean energy , in 10 years .
A plan to restop America to work , make sure us more safer , and help to stop global warming .
Finally , a solve that solve to our problems .
Repower America .
Al Gore : This is the last .
Video : It 's about returning energy in America .
One of the fastest ways to bring our dependence from combustible combustible that are killing our planet .
CA : The future is here . Sun , just a new energy network .
It turns out to 2 : Noves investment for good jobs .
Coming : Repower America . It 's time to be realists .
Al Gore : A old African vast African says , " If you want to go speaking , you go fast .
If you want to go away . "
We need to go away , quickly .
Thank you very much .
Last year at TED did an introduction in the LHC .
And I promise to figure out how the machine works .
So here I am . And here I am . And for the other time , the LHC is the largest scientific experiment ever trying to -- 27 kilometers of circumference .
His task is to remember the conditions that were present less than a billion across the universe -- to 600 million times a second .
This is simply environment .
This is the car under Ginevra .
Let 's take these mini-Big Bang inside the relevators .
This is what I work . It 's called ATLAS -- it 's large 44 meters and has a diameter of 22 meters .
This is a spectacular picture of ATLAS , so you can see the proportions .
Ten September 10-last year , we have accesum .
And this picture was taken by ATLAS .
And it was immense of immense control in the room .
It 's a picture of the first fasm of particle physical physiciple that had done all of the LHC , and spreading particles in the LHC , and spreading particles inside the relationship .
In other words , when we saw that image 10 , we figure out that the machine worked , which is a great victory .
I don 't know if it was this to make us more or more or this , when somebody went to Google and saw that the page was this .
That means that we 've had a cultural impact beyond that scientific .
About a week later , there was a problem with the machine , it was a problem with the machine .
So , these files bring 13,000 printing when the machine works at the massive of power .
Now , the technicians among of you will look at the kids and say , " It 's not true . They 're too subtle . "
And instead they can do it because when they 're very cool , they 're very cool superconducts .
So , at less 271 degrees , at less than 271 degree temperatures , these falls can bring that current .
In one of the juntures in the LHC magnets , there was a fabrication of fabrication .
So the river slightly heat slightly , and the 13,000 press suddenly , they met a electrical resistance .
This was the result .
Now , this is even more impressive if you think that these magnets have more than 20 tons , and they moved about 30 centimeters .
They are damaged about 50 magnets .
We had to take them , what we did .
We restined them and address .
Now , they 're back to all their place underground .
By the end of march the LHC will be again .
We 're going to happen , and we 're expected to get to judging or June , and then our adventure to discover which the universe .
Now , of course , in a way , these accidents reaching the debate of science and engineering in the value of science and engineering frontier .
I think the fact that it 's so difficult to go beyond the limitation of things like LHC .
I 'd like to end with the words of a scientist English , Humphrey Davy , which , I imagine , in defense experiments of his puple , Michael Faraday , his puple was Michael Faraday , he said , " Nient is so dangerous for the mind of the human mind , and there are no mysteries , which is no mysteries , and there 's no mysteries , and we don 't know about the worldwide . "
Thank you .
I want to start to ask you to think about when , children , from children , play with the morning .
As you understand how to achieve them , and get them , and get them and move them , learning and move , and you learn to think , and solve problems and spatial relationships .
The space reasoning is deeply connected to the way we understand a lot of the world around us .
So , inspired information by the uslity of our interaction with physical objects , together to my consulting Pt , and my collaborator Jeevan Kalanithi , I started asking , " And , when we use a computer , instead of having the only a computer , instead of having a digital car that moves on a desktop of the digital polysically , we could deal with the mands ,
and sistemulate it ?
The question was so interesting that we decided to explore the answer , building the Siftable .
In a few words , a Siftable computer is an interactive computers like a cookie .
In a few words , a Siftable computer is an interactive computers like a cookie .
You can see them moving with the hand , they can see " among them , feeling their movement and a radio screen .
But more practice , I 'm physical objects , you can simply move them .
The Siftable is example of a new ecosystem of tools to manipulate the digital information .
And as they get more physical , awarens of their movement , of others , and as they get more physical conscious , of the other , of how we move , we can exploring new and fun interaction .
I 'll start with some simple example .
This Siften is configurated to show the video : if you including it in a direction , the videos like this , if you including on the other side back .
These interactive rats are aware of others .
If you face them , they 're interested in what they 're doing .
If they 're surrounded , they notice it and they can act a little bit .
If they 're surrounded , they notice it and they can act a little bit .
They also have their movement and inclination .
And then I realized that one of the interesting implications of the interaction was the power to use of data , for example , " a color like it was a liquid .
In this case , we have three Siftable configurated as secks , and I can use them to put the color in that central , where they mix .
and I can use them for color in that central , where you mix .
If we 're too much , we can put a little bit .
There are also beautiful possibility of learning , like languages , math and games of logic and logic of logic of logic , and see the results immediately .
Now , I 'm --
This is a Fibonacks that I do with a equations program .
Here we have a words of words , which is half between Scarabean and Boggle .
Basically , at each turn a letter on every Siftable in every Siftable , Pratically , at every turn a letter to every Siftable , and while you try to get words control him on a dictionary .
Then , after about 30 seconds you remix , and you have a new set of letters and new possibilities to try .
Thank you .
So , here 's the kids came to the Media Lab , I did it , so that they tried them and turned a video video .
They 're very liked very .
And one of the interesting things about this kind of application is that you don 't have to give people a lot of instructions .
You just have to say , " Comptions of the words , and they know exactly what to do .
This is how other people who try it .
This is our header header header , on the right there .
It actually wanted to stick them .
They were only waves , for him .
Now , this is an interactive app .
We wanted to build a tools for the learning of languages .
It can insert new characters in the scene , solving the Siftouched .
It can insert new characters in the scene , solving the Siftouched .
So , it 's doing the sun .
Video : The sun is .
David Merrill : Now has taken a track in the scene .
Video : The arancient tractor .
Good ! Yeah .
So I school at the Siftable and put them close to the characters of the characters --
Video : Bau !
by inventing their own history .
Video : Ciao !
DM : It 's a story with an opened final story , and it can decide him how to fly .
DM : It 's a story with an opened final story , and it can decide him how to fly .
Video : Vola .
DM : The last example that I have the time to show you is a tool , realized , to walk and execting music .
It 's a tool , recently , to camping and execting music .
The Siftable here , sounds and sounds and the base .
Each of these has four different variations , and you can choose to use .
You can also insert these sounds in a sequence to buy your floor .
And it 's just modify to touch a sound and a sequence .
These are effects that you can control from alive , like the revert and the filter .
The attacks to a particular sound , and then including it .
And then there are the effects as time and volume , that you apply to the whole sequence .
Let 's look at how it works .
Video : DM : We 'll start putting a base in two Siftable " sequence , we 're going to address it in a series , we add other base .
Now I put a bottom line .
Video : DM : I 'm going to add of percussion --
Video : And I 'm going to put the battery , so I can control the effect of the alive .
Video : DM : I can speak the entire sequence the whole sequence of time from one side or the other .
Video : DM : And now I 'll add the filter to the flower to expression .
Video : DM : I can recombine the sequence " at the flight . "
So , I don 't have to planning it first , but I can improvising it , longer .
And now , finally , I can stop the entire sequence with the left Siftable to the Siftable .
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is building new interface new men and more like how our brain work .
And today , I 've had time to show you one of the results of this path , and also a few possibilities that we 're trying to get out of the lab .
The concept that I want to turn on is that new generation of objects designed to interact with digital media , which will bring information in our world way we want .
Thank you very much .
I don 't see the time to talk to all of you .
I 'm a writing .
I 'm writing books is my profession , but it 's more than that , of course .
It 's love and the love of my life .
And I don 't expect it to change .
But , I said that , something particularly happened in my life and in my career , which brought me to realibrate the whole job .
The particular thing is that I recently written this book , this biography called " Manogy , Prega , Ama , " which , " which , unlike my previous books , for a few reason he came out in the world and became a big sensational .
And the result is that anywhere now , people treat me as if you were convicted .
I mean , convicted , convicted .
They 're coming from me now , everybody 's worried and say , " Don 't you fear more ?
You don 't fear to continue to write for the whole life without being able to create a book that can important to somebody ? "
what do you care about somebody ?
It 's rassure , you know .
But it could go worse , I remember that over 20 years ago , when I started to say people -- I was an adolescent adolescent -- I was an adolescent .
I 'm going to meet the same reaction of fear .
And the people said , " Don 't it successful ? "
Don 't you fear that humiliation of the rejected rejection ?
You don 't fear to do this for all life without nothing that nothing has ever come out and die on a cumulation , and die on a full dreams of faulure ? "
So , you know .
The answer -- the brief response to all these questions is , " Yes . "
Yes , I fear of all those things .
I 've always had fear .
And I have also fear of many other things that people could not have to introduce .
Like the algae and other things .
But , how about it was write about what I thought , and I would ask me finally , it 's why ?
It 's rational ?
It 's logical that anybody has to waiting to be screened by a job that it 's born to do .
But what is there is so particularly in the impress to make us nervous health of the health health other people do not do ?
As my father , for instance , he was a chemical engineer and I don 't remember one in his 40 years of activity where he was asked if she fear to be engineer ?
It was never -- that block of the engineer John , how ?
It didn 't work like this , you know ?
Onestly , chemical engineers like group don 't certainly , in the centuries , driven the reputation of being handed maniacis .
We have enough writers , we have enough this reputation , and not just writers , but creatives of all this reputation of being enormously unstable mentally .
And it 's not going to look at the sad of the magniques of the magnifies of creative minds that , only in the 2th century , they die young and often for them .
And the ones who are not suicipatory seems to be real dissatives from their dons .
Norman Mailer , before he died in the last interview , he said , " Every my book killed me a little bit more . " A extraordinary affermation about the work of their life .
But we don 't buy , when we feel that because we 've heard these things that we 've heard these things that we have completely interized and accepted the notion that creativity and suffering are somehow leged and the art , at the end , at the end , it will be during the ancient .
And the question I want to bring everybody today is : you agree with this idea ?
It 's good about this thing -- because it looks at a centimeter of distance to me , it 's not good for nothing .
I think it 's odious .
And I think it 's also dangerous and I don 't want to see the perpetuated century .
I think it 's better encourage our big creative minds to live .
And I certainly know that , in my case , in my situation -- it would be very dangerous to start fire out at the head of the circumstances in which I 'm in my career .
It 's pretty young , I 'm pretty young , I have about 40 years .
I still have about four decades work in me .
And it 's very likely that whatever I write about it now is going to be judly by the world as the work that was going to go out after my last book .
I 'm going to be slavery , because we 're all more or less friends here -- is likely that my greatest success here .
Oh , Gesus , who thought !
You know this is the kind of thought that leads a person to start drink a person to start drink and I don 't want to do it .
I want to continue to do this work that I love .
So , the question is , how ?
And so it seems to me , after many reflections , that the way to work to continue to write is to create a psychological costruction , OK ?
I have to make a safety distance of safety between me , which I 'm writing , and my natural anxiety on what 's going to be able to get . And , as I was trying for all the last year , trying to find other societies to see whether they could have the best ideas and healthy to see if they could have the best ideas and more healthy ideas and healther
about how to help people create creative inherent the risks of creativity .
And that research took me to the ancient Grecia and ancient Rome .
Seguitem because it turns it back .
In the ancient Grecia and ancient Rome -- people didn 't seem to believe that creativity came from men , OK ?
It was thought that creativity was this spirit health divine , and it came to the men from a few source and unknown , for distant reasons and unknown .
The creativity was called the creativity of the creativity of creativity .
Socrate , wonderful , he believed to have a demon that else wisdom .
The Romans were the same idea , but they called that kind of spirit without a genius .
Which is great , because the Romans didn 't really think that a genius was a little genius .
They thought that a genius was this kind of entity that was created in literally lived in the walls of the study of a artist , a little bit like the elpho Dobby , and that he came out of hidden the work of artist and model the result of the artist and model the result of that work .
Except -- this is , that 's the distance of which I talk about -- that psychological costruction that protected you from the results of your work .
And everybody knew it was that it worked , right ?
So the ancient artists were protected by certain things , like , for instance , right ?
If your work was exceptional job , you couldn 't take all the deserve , everybody knew that you were helped by this genius .
If your failed work , it wasn 't all your lives , right ?
Everybody knew it was your genius to be a unable .
And so the people han conceived creativity in the West for a long time .
Then the Renaisance came and everything changed , and this big idea ; we put the human being at the center of the universe , and the mysteries and the mysteries and no longer leaving space and no longer creatures and no longer leaving space .
This was the principle of human rational and the people began to think that the creativity was completely from ishing .
And for the first time in history , it began to refer to this or that artist as a rather than one person .
And I have to tell you , I think it was a big error .
I think we allow somebody , a simple person to believe that you can be as a recipient as the source , and the source of all mysteries divines , creative , unknown and ethernal responsibility to the human fragile .
It 's how to ask somebody to stick the sun .
At form and bears completely the ego and creates all these ingestimates of the performance .
And I think it was this pressure address the artists in the past 500 years .
And if this is true , and if this is true , and now ?
Can we do it different ?
Maybe back to a more understanding of the relationship between humans and creative mystery .
Or perhaps not .
Maybe we can 't sell 500 years of rational thinking in a 18 minutes .
And there 's probably people in the audience who would sollead to scientific subjects on the notion of scientific known , you do that they follow , or failed their projects .
I 'm probably not going to convince you all about this thing .
But the question I 'd like to ask is -- why not ?
Why not thinking about this way ?
because it has more sense of everything that I 've ever heard to explain the exasperformance of creative process .
A process that , like anybody who ever tried to do something -- so , basically , everybody here -- everybody is , you don 't understand rationally .
And , in fact , sometimes it can sometimes completely paranormal .
And I did this meeting with the extraordinary poetesse Ruth Stone , who has now 90 years , but it was a poetesse for all life and he told me that during his childhood in the Virginia , working out in the Virginia , she was working out in the Virginia .
He told me it was like a fragorous air train .
And that was rotating towards her landscape .
He heard this , because it was a lot of the earth under its feet .
He knew to have one thing to do at that point and it was words , " correct like a bad . "
And so it goes back home , and it wouldn 't have to make something else , and it wouldn 't have to make a piece of paper , and he wouldn 't be quickly collering and raising it and raising it on the page .
Sometimes it couldn 't be fast fast enough , and it 's running and raised and correct her to the home and poem her through the landscape , and she would continue to rotle through the landscape , trying , as she said , " another poet . "
Then there were those times -- this piece I 'm going to never forget it -- there were moments when it was almost losing it , OK ?
So , he was running home and he was trying to the card and the poem through , and he was going through , and he was saying , he was like , and then he said , what it was like to draw up with the other hand and the step .
The poetry from the tail , and put it into his body , and put it into his body .
And in these cases , the poem would be presented on the perfect , and the last word of the last word .
So when I felt it -- it 's crazy , it 's exactly equal to my creative process .
Not all my creative process -- not all my creative process .
I 'm a mule , and my way to work is ; you wake up to the same time , every day , and then work and go and go up and pass us enjoy .
But even I , in my tardaggin , I have stripped against that thing , sometimes .
And I imagine that a lot of you have a lot of you .
You know , even though the work and ideas came to me from a certain source , I could not honestly know it .
And what is this thing ?
And how can we talk to it to it in a way that we 're not going to do the heads , but , rather , rather , make us remain healthy ?
The best example of me , the best example contemporary example , which I have is the Tom Waits , which I interviewed in a day .
We were talking about this , and you know , Tom , for most of life has been the entertaining of the artist recontemporary artist , trying to control , handing these species of impulses totally internation .
But then I invest , he took up , and one day as he was driving on a driving in Los Angeles , changed all for him .
He was going to speak and all of a feelody tracks , and it comes into its heads , and it gets into its heads how the inspiration , elusive , and it wants , you know , it 's wonderful , and the desider , but not how to take it .
It doesn 't have a piece of paper , it doesn 't have a matter .
So , it starts to hear this kind of old anxiety in him , " I 'm going to lose it , and I 'm going to lose it , and I 'm going to go to this song lost .
I 'm not good enough and I can 't do it . "
And instead of going to the panic , he stopped .
I 'm going to do the whole mental process , and he did something completely new .
I just look at the sky and he said , " Don 't see that I 'm driving ? "
" Are you going to write a song now ?
If you really want to exist , you can go back to a more opposed when I can take care of you .
Otherwise , you 're going to do something else today .
You can see Leonard Cohen . "
And his working process .
Not the work , the job was still dark .
But the process , and the fishing anxiety that was released when the genius , the genius out of him that problems and liberation .
but brought this peculiar , wonderful bizarre collaboration between Tom and this strange thing , and this strange thing that 's not Tom .
So as I feel that story started changing a little bit the way I worked to change the way I worked and already .
This idea , I was saved when I was writing , " Manogy , " Ama , " and falls in one of the disperation in which we cause everybody when we 're working on something , and we can 't start to think that it is going to be a disaster , that that 's going to be the worst book .
Not only bad , just the worst books .
And I started to think about throw this project .
But then I remembered Tom that was talking to air , and I tried to us .
So I got my face in the manudged and deresses my commments to a vacuum of the room .
And I told high voices , " You know , what if this is not going to be brilliant book , it 's not going to be interacted , right ?
Because as you see , I 'm putting all I have , I don 't have more than that .
So , if you want to be better , you have to introduce you and do your part .
Okay . But if you don 't do it , I don 't do anything .
I 'm going to write the same because it 's my work .
And I 'd like to please that it was recorded that I 've been presented to do my part . " Because it 's so , OK -- seats ago in the North Africa 's deserts for damage to the clear of the clear of the clear of the clear , danze and music that they were going on for hours .
And they were always magnificent , because the ballers were professionals .
But every once , rarely , something happened , and one of these artists became actually .
And I know that you know what I 'm talking about , because I know you all have seen , at some point , one performance like that .
It was like the time stopped , and the ballering dancing through a kind of walked through a kind of walking , like 1,000 nights before , but everything was moving .
And suddenly not appeared as a human .
But it turns out to the divinside the fire in the fire of divinity .
And when this happen , at the time , people knew what was called it with his name .
They had the hands and began to sing , " Allah , Allah , Allah , Allah , God . "
That 's God , you know .
Curious known historical -- when the More invading the south of Spain , the southern , and the pronounce of the South , Allah , Allah , Allah , Allah , Allah " , " , " which , " which , " which , " which , " which , " which , " which is still you feel in the corrids .
In Spain , when an artist has made something impossible and magical , " Allah , magical , " Allah , magical , good , " incomprehensible , " incomprehensive , " incomprehensive , God .
And it 's great because we need it .
But , the problem comes the day later , for the ballery itself , when you wake up and discover that 's 11 morning of Marteday , and the God is no longer .
It 's just a mortal with the knees of the knees , and maybe it 's not going to be able to get to that height .
And perhaps name is still going to be the name of God still , and what do you have to do with the rest of his life ?
It 's hard .
This is one of the most painful recognization to make a creative life .
But maybe it doesn 't have to be so angoscious if you can 't believe , in fact , in fact , that the most extraordinary aspects of your being .
But it 's simply believed that they 're given from an unimaginable source of this squisity part of your life that you have to get to somebody else when you finished .
And , you know , if we think about it all changes .
And so I started thinking about it , and it 's certainly as I thought about it for several months during the work of the book that I 'm going to publishing soon , dangerous , thesism , thesism ,
And what I have to continue to tell me when I feel elected by this is , not having .
Don 't go down . It 's just your work .
It enues to presented you for your part , whatever it can be .
If your work is dancing .
If the divine , absurd genius to leave to leave some kind of wondering , for one moment through your efforts , just for one moment through your efforts , then , " Ole ! "
Otherwise , you do the same dance .
" Ole ! " " in the same thing .
And I think we have to teach it .
" You know , " to yet the same , even for having a human love and testardaggin the same way .
Thank you .
Thank you .
June Cohen : Ole !
You know , I 've already talked about some of these projects on the human genome , about what it can mean and discovery of new genes .
Now we 're starting a new path : We started to digitalize biology and now we 're entering in a new phase of biology , designing and synthesizing and synthesizing life .
We 've always tried to get big questions .
" What is life ? " It 's something that a lot of biologists have trying to figure out livels .
We tried different approaches , reduce it to minimal terms .
We 're digitalizing from almost 20 years .
When we sequenced the human genome was to go from the analog world in the digital world of computers .
Now , we 're going to ask us : we can regenerate life from this digital universe ?
This is the map of a small organism , the Mycoplasma genitalium , which is the smallest genome in the lab .
And we tried to reduce the genome to make one more smaller .
We 're able to eliminate a hundred genes of about 500 genes that are here .
But when we look at its metabolic map , it 's relatively simple respect to our .
Let me , this is simple .
But when we look at all of the genes that we can eliminate , one at a time , it 's very unlikely that this can bring to a living cells .
So we decided that the only way to make a synthesthetize this chromosome that we can modify the components to brings some of these fundamental questions .
And so we started the adventure of " Can we synthesize a chromosome ? "
It can be able to produce these great molecules that we haven 't been able to create before ?
And , in case , we can make a chromosome ?
A chromosome is simply a chromosome of inert material .
The speed with which we 're able to digitalize life is growing exponential rhythm .
Our ability to write the genetic code , instead , rather slowly , but it 's improve .
And our most recent results it on a exponential curve .
We started over 15 years ago .
The process required a lot of passages , starting with a bioetic review before we started the first experiments .
But we discovered that DNA is very hard .
There are tens of thousands of machines of the world that produce little DNA , the letter of 30 to 50 letters and it 's a degenerative process : the segment is more errors .
So we had to develop a new method to assembly these fragments and correct the mistakes .
And this has been our first attempt , to go from information digital genome of the genome of Phi X 174 .
It 's a small virus that kills kills .
We designed the fragments , effected the correction of errors , and I got a DNA molecule of about 5,000 letters .
Now , what 's interesting is when we took this piece of inhert material , and we put it into the bacteria , the bacteria have started to read this genetic code and to produce the viral particles .
The viral particles have been released by cells , are back and destroyed the E. coli .
I talked about recently with the oil of the oil industry saying that they have certainly understood this model .
They have more than you .
We believe that this is a situation where the software can really build his own hardware , in a biological system .
But we wanted to do the bigger things .
We wanted to build the whole bunch of the bacteria .
It 's more than 580,000 genetic code .
So we thought we could build it in seven of the viruses of the size viruses , so that we can change in seven to understand what the components of a living cell .
The design is crucial , and if we start with digital information in a computer , these have to be very accurate .
When we sequence this genome for the first time in 1995 , the standard time in 1995 .
We 've discovered , 30 errors . If we used that original sequence , we would never be able to make it work .
A part of the process is designing 50 lectimate segment of the process of 50 letters to be able to build smaller subunits of 50 letters to work together .
Let 's look at unique elements here .
You know , you 're probably going to put it on the filit .
Think of this : We have a genetic code based on four letters : A , C , G and T.
Three of those letters together codify about 20 minoacids , and there 's a specific order of letters for every adminothacid .
So we can use the genetic code to write words , frages .
What we did in the beginning was authography .
Some of the fact that it 's not poem .
We designed these segments to simply joining them with enzymes .
There are enzymes that repair them and put them together .
And we began to assemble of the parts , starting with five to segments from five to seven thousand letters of 24 thousand letters of the letters of 24 thousand letters .
At every step we produced these sorts in abundance so that we 're trying to sequence that we 're trying to create a extremely robustood -- as you 'll see in a minute .
We 're trying to automatizing the process .
So , this looks like the tabellon of a basket .
When we get to these very long segments , more than 100 thousand 100 thousand is not going to grow the directly .
It goes to the limit of the modern biology .
So we looked at other mechanisms .
We knew about another mechanism mechanism called recombination , which in biology , in biology , we 're used to repair the DNA can address .
Here 's an example .
This organism , called Deinococcus radiation , it can absorb three million raradiation .
You can see in the superior as its chromosome of its chromosome .
In 12 -- 24 hours , it 's exactly how it was before .
There 's thousands of organisms that are able to do it .
These organisms can be completely .
They can live under vacuum .
I 'm absolutely certain that life exist in space , and you moved to find new environments of water .
In fact , NASA showed that this happens .
This is a picture of the molecule that we 've built using these processes , just using the lights with design appropriate .
The evidence is automatically .
This image was not taken with an electronic microscope , but with a regular microscope .
It 's a great molecule that we can see it with a microscope .
These are pictures that cover a six seconds .
This is the advertising that we did a little time ago .
It 's more than 580,000 letters of genetic code .
It 's the biggest molecule of a defined structure we 've ever created by human .
It has a molecular weight of 300 million .
If we stamp with a 10 without spaces , it would like 142 pages , it would like 142 pages , it would like 142 pages .
Now , how do we make it work ?
Obviously , you love a viruses is a kids .
It 's a little more complicated when they use .
It 's simpler even when it 's eucarios like our : You can simply extract the nucleus and put another , which is basically the clonically process .
In the bacterium archaea is integrated inside the cell , but we have recently recently , we recently recently , we recently demonstrated that we 're able to make a cell transplanting of a cell to another and activity .
We brought up a microbial species .
The two are different than men .
We have added a few gene that we could decide what to choose for this chromosome .
And then skiing with the enzymes to kill all the proteins .
And when we put it into the cell . And when we put it into the cell . You 'll appreciate our sophisticatoes -- the new chromosome went into the cell .
And we thought we couldn 't go beyond , but we 've tried anyway out there .
This is one of the most mechanisms of evolution .
We discovered that many species have added species have added a third or a third cromosome of new tracts to that species .
So who thinks about evolution as a only gene gene at the time , it doesn 't understand a lot of biology .
There 's enzymes called restraight enzymes of restrained the DNA .
The chromosome that was in the cell .
The cell cell phone that we have insert it .
It 's expressed , and he recognized the other chromosome as extensive material , has masticated with only the cell and the new cell chromosome .
It became blue because of the genes that we put .
And in a brief time , all the characteristics of a species have gone , and it turned out of all the new species , based on a new species , based on the new software that we put in the cell .
All the proteins are changed , membranes are changed , and when we read the equivast exactly to what we 've taken you .
Now , this could seem alchemy genetic software , but altering the software , we can change things into things .
Now , I 've already explained that you 're not talking about genesis -- but to progress from three and a half million years of evolution , and I said that maybe we 're going to create a new version of Cambrian explosion of Cambrian explosion in which they 're going to create new species on this digital process .
Why do that ?
I think it 's obvious when we think about our needs .
We 're going to go from six and a half billion people to nine billion in the next 40 years .
Just for example : I was born in 1946 .
Now there are three people on the planet for each existing in 1946 ; in 40 years , there will be four .
We 're having problems now to find food , fresh water and clean and clean and a half billion people .
It 's going to be more tough to do it for nine billion .
We use more than five billion coal , more than 30 billion coal , more than 30 billion babies .
That means hundred millions of barrel a day .
When we try to find biological processes , or any kind of process to reduce them , it 's going to be a huge challenge .
We have to keep account of CO2 from these materials that end up in the atmosphere .
At day , thank you with scientific discoveries around the world , we have a database with about 20 million genes , and I like to think they are designed for the future .
The electronic industry only is a dozine of components , and think about how many different things came out .
Our limitations here is related by biological reality and our imagination .
Now we now have a techniques , thanks to these methods of synthesization , can create what we call combinatory genomics .
We 're able to build a big robot that can make a big robot that can produce a million cromosomes a day .
Think of processing these 20 million genes or to try and optimize the processes to produce either optimize or drugs , new vaccines , we can change , because of a small team , and create more biology that in the last 20 years of science .
And it 's just a standard selection .
We can choose for survival of survival , production chemical or fuel , fuel vaccines .
This is an instantaneer of some software programmed that we 're working on to be able to seat and design species to the computer species .
Well , we don 't necessarily know how they 'll be .
We know exactly what their genetic code .
Now we 're focus on the fuels of quarter generation .
You also saw you that extract from the grate was a bad experiment .
We have a lot of seconds and third generation that will be soon as soon as much higher than either value or different types of butanol .
But the only way that biology can have a large impact without increasingly increasing the cost of food and limitate the availability will be transforming CO2 in matter , so we 're working on to design cells that can be achieving this discover , and we think we could have this discovered , and we think we could have the first generation in about 18 months .
The sunlight sunlight with CO2 is a metodow -- but in our discoveries around the world , we found different metods .
This is an organism that we described in 1996 .
It lives in the deep ocean , about 2500 meters of depth of water temperature .
They create molecular hydrogen , using hydrogen molecular source of energy source .
We 're trying to figure out whether we can clear the CO2 , which can easily be moved by the way , convert that CO2 in fuel , to drive this process .
So , we think that we could be able to increase what we could increase what the basic question of what the basic question of what is life is . We have the goal of replacing the entire oil industry .
Exactly . If you can 't do it from TED , where can you ?
It would be a main energy source .
Also , we 're working for using the same methods to create vaccines .
You 've seen this year with the flu , we 're always back of a year , and with a dollar until it is to find the vaccine .
I think that you can change building vaccinate vaccination .
So this is how the future could start seem changing , now , the tree of evolution , accelerating evolution with synthetic bacteria .
We 're at a lot of the improving people .
Our purpose is to do a long enough to try to do it . Thank you very much .
First of all , I 'm going to show you , the most rapidly possible , some work , the new technology that we 've taken to the Microsoft in the following of a year ago exactly . This is Seadragon .
It 's a environment in which you can interact is at the local level that remote with an enormous amount of data .
We 're seeing a lot of gigabytes of digital photos with a kind of zoom constantly and continuum , for a landscape , disponing the images of how we want .
And it doesn 't matter how big the amount of information that we see , how big these are collection of data or images or images .
Most of Congress are digital photographs , but this is a scan for example of the Congress from the Congress of Congress .
It doesn 't make any difference because the only thing that limited the prestations of a system like this is the number of pixels on your screen in any time . It 's a very flexible architecture .
This is a whole book , example of no images .
This is the Dickens of Dickens . Every colonna represents a chapter .
To show you that it 's just about textboard and not images , we can do something like that , to really show that it 's a real representation of the textboard , not a picture picture .
It could be a little artificial way to read a book .
It 's not about it .
This is a more realistic example . It 's an example of the Guardian .
Every picture is the beginning of a section .
And it really gives you the pleasure and the beautiful experience to read the true version of a magazine or a quotidian , which is for nature , a molteplice .
We also did something with the angle of this particular number of The Guardian .
We created a higher commercial advertising -- much more higher than one of what you use in a normal advertising -- and we put you in the extra content .
If you want to see the characteristics of this automobile , you can see here .
Or other models , or even the specific specific techniques .
And this really shows some of these ideas to eliminate the limitations of space on screen .
We hope that it means to put up to the pop-up pop-up , and other porcheries , not need to be necessary .
Of course , mapping is one of the most obvious applications for this kind of technology .
And I don 't want to lose time , if not to say that we don 't have contributes to get in this field .
These are all the roads in the United States .
So now we go to something else .
This is effectively from the Web ; you can go and see it .
This is a project called Photosynth , which combine two different technologies .
One is Seadragon and the other is a visual research a very interesting research at Noah Snavely , a student of the University of Washington , with Steve Steve Steve Steve Siki , and of Microsoft Rick Szeliski . It 's a good collaboration .
And it 's from Seadragon .
You can see it when we do this kind of screening , where we can go from one image to another and have this kind of multiple resolution .
But the spatial of the pictures here has actually a meaning .
The algorithms of visualization computers have recorded these pictures together , so that correspond to the real places in real places in the recorded imagined -- all of these sorts of the Grasis about the Montagne Roccious canaded -- they 're taken . Those of the elements of a slide-stable show stable or imaging panoring , and these things have been connected .
I don 't know if I have time to show you some other environment .
There are a lot more space .
I want to move directly to one of the original data set of Nohah data -- and this comes from a previous prototype of Photosynth that we did work for the first time last summmer -- to show you what I think is the key is really behind this , technology Photosystems . And it 's not necessarily evident to look at the environments that we put in the website .
We had to worry about legal aspects and so on .
This is a reconstruction of Notre Dame pictures taken from Flickr . Baast type of Dame in Flickr , and you get images of types in shirt , other of the campus , other of the campus , other of the campus and so on .
So they 're all sorts of Flickr , and they were all connected to this way .
And it 's possible to navigate this way simple .
You know , I would never have thought to end up working on Microsoft .
It 's very gratifying to receive this kind of collection here .
I think you can see that it 's about a lot of different types of different types of different kinds of phones to the professional SLR , a significant number number number , moved together in this environment .
And if I can , I try to look for those strange .
A lot of them are block , etc .
Somewhere you find a series of photographs -- here we are .
This is a Notre Dame recorded correctly .
We can go from the poster to the view of this environment .
The essential point is that we can do things with social environment . This is now taking data from the ential memory -- from the entire memory of how the earth , from vision .
All those pictures become connected , more than the sum of the sum of parts .
You 've got a model of the whole land that emerging .
Think about this as a Stephen Lawler 's work on Earth .
It 's something that growing in complexity as the people to use it , and the advantages for people to use it .
Their photos are brands with other people .
If somebody comes the idea of against all these sorts of saying the name , my photograph of Notre Dame is a picture of all this data , and I can use this data , and I can use it as a moment in the space , in that metaphor , in that metaphs , in that metaphor , in that metaphs , in that metaphs , and have a social experience of cross-mode and red cross-mode experience .
Of course , a consequence of this is virtual model of any interesting part of the earth , collection of any interesting than the earth , it collection of all interesting images and satellite images and similar images , but by the collective memory .
Thank you very much .
Chris Anderson : I understood good ? What your software is going to be able to do is that , in the next few years , all the photographs shared by anybody in the entire world will be related together ?
BAA : Yes . What it 's doing is basically discover .
It 's creating hyperlink , if you want , among images .
And it 's doing it in the base of the pictures .
The thing becomes very interesting if you think about the wealth of semantic information that many of these images can have .
As you get a picture of images on the websentence , and the text on the Web page has a lot of information about the picture .
Now , what happens if that pictures connects to all your pictures ?
So the amount of semantic interconnection and the amount of wealth that is really enormous . It 's an enormous classic effect of the network .
CA : Blaise , it 's really amazing .
BAA : I thank you very much .
One of the main pleasures when you travels and one of the research nographic research is the power of living between who has not forget the anti-traditions of the past in the wind , touch in the stones .
Jaguar to think that Jaguar travel even beyond the Via Lattea , or that the old Inuit is still a model of meaning , or in Himalayas , in Himalayas , the buddhidden , to remind the importance of Dharma , to remind the importance of the Dharma , and that the idea that the world in which we live in fact , but it 's just a model of reality ,
the consequence of a particularly set of adapt that our styris , good or bad , a lot of generations ago .
And , of course , we all share of the essential tracts .
Everybody is born . Everybody 's going to create .
We are subjects at the beginning .
We need to deal with the inesorability of death , so we don 't surprise and the ballit --
We all have art .
What it hit is the special rhythm , the rhythm of every culture .
It doesn 't matter that they 're the Penan of the Borneo , or the follows of Haiti , or the follows of Haiti 's desert in Kenya settt in Kenya Sahara , or a camera in the heart of the Sahara .
He was my journey of journey in the desert a month ago , or a hundred yak valle , in the Everest Everest , the bottom of the world .
All of these populations teaching us that there are other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , other ways of move in the world .
And , if you think a second , it 's a concept that can give you hope .
Insit together , the cultures of the world 's cultures creating a spiritual life of spiritual and cultural life that we want to the planet , and it 's important to the well-being of biological rage as well as the biological rage .
And you can think about this cultural ragnature like a cultural ethnosphere , and you can define the sum of all the concepts , dreams , mites , ideas , inspiration , inspiring , intuitions , willing to be human imagination .
The etnosphere is the patrimony of humanity .
It 's the symbol of what we are and what we can be in as a species .
And since the biosphere has been a lot of consumed as it happened to the ethnosphere and purfortunately .
No biologist , for example , it would say that 50 percent of all the species has been , or is on the high of extinction , because it 's false -- in the most optimistic extinction -- in the field of biological diversity -- and you don 't even get close to the most optimistic of cultural diversity .
The index is , of course , the linguistic loss .
When you 're born 6,000 languages on this planet .
A language of language is not just from a vocabulary or a series of rules .
A language of the human spirit .
It 's the middle of every culture of every culture of the material world .
Every language is a forest of the mind , a way , a spiritual thinking ecosystem .
And those 6,000 languages , as we 're sitting here in Monterey , at least half of the kids .
They 're no longer teached kids , which means , unless you wouldn 't change something , which is already died .
What 's more sad about the silence of being the silence , about being the last few to talk to a language , not having a language that 's wisdom or anticipate the promise of children ?
This bearing is the state of somebody in the world every two weeks : every two weeks of a couple of weeks -- every two weeks of a ancic language .
And I know somebody who 's going to say , " Isn 't that ?
The world wouldn 't be a better place if we talked all the same language ? " Well , we 're talking to all yoruba .
Let 's talk about kogs .
You 're going to discover about what it means is not to talk to their language .
Today I 'd like to make you a journey through ethnosphere --
a little journey journey to give you a little bit of what we 're losing .
A lot of us forget that when I say , " different ways of existing very different ways of exists . "
Let 's take for example , this baby Barasana , in Amazony section , the popular of anaconda , which believes the myth of the latte of the latte of the latte of the snarrooms .
This is a popular popular that 's not able to distinguish the blue color from the green , because it is identified in the forest , which depends the popular .
They have a strange language and a worldwide , called " language " : " You have to mark a different language .
Everything has radical in the Mitological past , is that the particularity is that in these families , where they 're talking about six or seven languages no one practice .
They 're limited to listen to listen .
Let 's take one of the most interesting tribes that I lived , the Waorts of Ecuador , an incredible popular that have the first contacts in 1958 .
In 1957 five missionaries have taken a commodities .
They made out of the photographs that they found them in a few of adished friendly , that this population popular forest that this popular popular popular forest .
They collected the pictures of the land , they turned to the research of a shape or a figure out of the diaving , and they kills the five missionarise with the lance .
But the Waorani not only killed the foreign .
They killed with them .
54 percent of the mortality was caused by themselves .
We 're risalites at eight generations and we found two cases of natural death and when we innered to know , they admed that one of them was aging , and then they had a kills of course , and then they killed him .
The hunters were able to recognize the animal urine from 40 steps and recognize it .
In the early ' 80s , I was assigned a very interesting task when my Harvard professor when I was asked if I wanted to go to Haiti to Haiti in the base of the power of Duvalier and Tonton Macoutes , and impossessed to the Duvalier used to the zombies .
To give a sense of miraculous , I 'd have to understand a culture of Vodoun and that Vooodoo is not magic .
It 's pretty about a complex metaphysical view of the world .
Very interesting .
If I ask you to tell me the great religions of the world , what would you say ?
Christianism , Islam , Buddhism , etc .
A continent is always left out , thinking that the sub-Saharan Africa doesn 't have religious . And instead of religious concepts . And Vooodoo is not that the distillation of these religious concepts of these very profound born tragic concepts of slavery .
What makes the voodoo is the intense relationship between life and death .
So , you know , the spirits of the spirits .
The spirits can be invited by the Grande Acqua , they respond to the rate of the dance of the dance and replaced temporary soul of the view is the follows .
So the vooodooists love to say , " You 're going to churk up God .
We say in the temple and forget God . "
And since you 're going to be sitting you , is the spirit that you 're driving you , how do you ?
So you look at these incredible events : following voodoo in state of trance that touching unk til the infuse of the power of mind , when it 's catalyzed , when it 's catalyzed in a state of extreme extreme .
On all the populs with the most extraordinary of the most extraordinary of the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta , in Colombia section .
Each ancient civilization that once were living on the characters of Colombia in waiting , the popular popular popular massive civilization that you erve on the caraibs .
In a blood continent slide , this popular population has never been conquered by Spanish .
At today , they 're governed by a clero , but their formation is really extraordinary .
The young people followed by the families to three or four years , and they live secreged in a good world and secreged in a good world and shake in the bottom of the glacier for 18 years .
Two periods of nine years choices to reproduce the nine months of gestation that spending into the mother of mother , are now metaphor in the Great Mother .
For all this time , they 're acculturated to the values of their society , values that their prayers and only their prayers , they keep the cosmic balance .
At the term of this incredible initiation , they 're suddenly taken out and for the first time in life , at the age of 18 years , they see a tape . And in that account of the first wrong landscape , when the sun is wrong valley of the beautiful landscape , everything that have learned in theory , it 's a step back , and it says , "
" Visto ? Do how I told you .
It 's amazing . It 's about you protect it . "
It 's called largest brothers and they say that we , brothers , we 're the collection of the world 's destruction .
This is intuition is extremely important .
When we think about indigenous populations and the environment , we 're sitting Resau and the old story of the noble self-concept , which is a razy concept in his simplicity or perhaps , we say that these populations are closer to the Earth of us .
The Ingenies are not feels , not feels indebate by the nostalogy .
There is no space for these things in the malaric paluds of Asto or winds of the Tibet , but thanks at the time and returns , they created a mystical mystical mystical conscious about the concept of being knowledge that the Earth can only live only because it 's infected by human consciousness .
What does it mean ?
I want to say that a kid of the Ande that growing the mountain is one of the Apu wait is going to drit his destiny , it will be a different deeply different relationship with the mountain or that place of the Montana or that place is a little bit of Montana or the Montana of the Montana of the Montana of the Montana of the Montana .
That 's the dimora of a spirit or a mineral was irrelevant .
What it 's interesting is the metaphor that defines the relationship between individual and the natural world .
I grew up in the forest of Columbia British Columbia forest to be cut .
This is made me a human being being a different from my friends Kwakiutlutl believe that the forests are the Hukuk 's dimora of Hukuk , and the paradise of the paradise , and the dogs that live on the north of the world , spirits that face during the Hamator .
If you start considering that these cultures can create different reality , you can start to understand some of their sensitive discoveries .
I taken this picture to open in the northern Amazonia .
Mayahuash some of you have heard about the imagination , the most powerful substance of the science repertoire .
What makes it fascinating the ayahuisn 't the potential of the substance of the substance , but its elaboration . It 's two elements of two elements .
From one side , this leaving leaving a series of beta-carbolin , harmine and harmine and harmine and harmine , slightly .
Take the only plant you have a blue smoke that alters a little bit the consciousness , but it 's misceled with the leaves of a family of the Psychotria redis .
This plant contains , very similar powerful , very similar to the serotonin methyltryltrylthoxypamines .
If you ever see Yanomami , you 're going to see the nose of the substance of the substance that make a different set of species , anchyltrylthoxypamine .
It 's a little bit of the bigger for the nose is a little bit like being disappeared by a bunch of paints and land on a sea of electricity . It doesn 't create a distortion of reality ; it creates the dissolution of reality .
I had often with my professor , Richard Evan Shultes , the man who took the psychedelic was psychedelic , in the 1930s in Mexico .
So , my thesis , I can 't get these tripamines like hallucinogens because if you can 't tell anybody to be telling anybody of being hurt , but they can 't tell anybody to be hurt because they 're money from a physis , because they 're money from an enzyme that 's naturally in the intestine , deted by the intestine monoxinept .
It 's possible to be assumption , if you 've just gone with other chemicals that money the MAO .
Now , it 's the beautiful : carboline dies that are in this liana lead of MAO , the same kind of the same kind of need to be able to powering tripamine . The question is spontanem : in a 80,000 species of plants , how they 're doing these popular populations , but if you combined it in this way , create a biochemical version that 's sum about the sum of parts ?
We use the great heavy of evidence and error , which can revealing .
But if we ask the Indians , they 'll tell us , " The plants are talking about . "
What does it mean ?
This tribes , the Cofan , has 17 varieties of ayahuash , that distingue , and our eyes would be going to reach in the same species .
If we asked them as they 're going to say , " No . "
The solution is : you take the 17 varieties in a night of moon and each night with a lot of different .
With that you don 't graduate to Harvard , but it 's much more interesting that contt the stams .
Now , [ , ] the problem is that also the ones of us who have at heart people who have at heart populs out of the history , but somehow reduced to the margins of history in our real world , and passionate .
In fact , the 20th century , between 300 years , it 's not going to be reminded for the wars or its innovations , but rather like the era that was where we stopped and actively , actively destruction of biological diversity and cultural diversity of biological and cultural cultural diversity of the planet . Now the problem is not the change .
All cultures through the centuries have been involved in a dance for new life .
And the problem is not technology .
The Indians Sioux didn 't stop being Sioux , when they put out of the arrows and failed as Americans don 't stopped being Americans when they put out of American and cables .
It 's not the change or technology who threatening the integrity of ethnosphere .
The domination fly .
And if you look at the world , you 'll find that these are not cultures are not cultured to disappear .
They 're living and dynamics and dynamics are dynamics and dynamics are beyond the ability of adaptation .
Whether it 's disboscaring in the Patrit of the Penan --
a popolluted by Sarak , in the Southeast Asian popular popular that lived in the forest to a generation , and now reduced to the service and the prostitution on the reserves of the rivers , where you can see the river of the rivers , where you can see the river from the ridge , where you can see the river of the naveled Merian , where the naveled Merion , where the navates ,
ready to reempires to fill the stick with the forest .
Or , in the case of Yanomami , are the diseases that have come to the discovery of gold .
If we move on the Tibet , where I 'm doing a lot of research , you 'll see the hard of political domination .
As you know the genocide , physical extinction of a popular , it 's convicted to universal lives , but the destruction of a popular lifestyle , not only is convicted , but it 's not convicted , but it 's not convicted , but it makes the strategy of development .
And you can 't understand the Tibet until you from the beginning .
I lost the 6,000 miles from China in the Western China through the South East Tibet , coming to Lhasa with a young connection , but only came to Lhasa , I realized what 's behind the statistics that we feel about .
6,000 sacred monuments to dust and crazy .
1.2 million people killed by military military during Cultural Rivolution .
The father of this guy was ascritical at the Panchen Lama .
which means that it 's been killed at the time of Chinese invasion .
Her uncle is furniture with Sua Santity of the diaspora that brought the popular in Nepal .
Her mother was impresoned , and his knight was to be rich .
It was brought to hidden at the age of two years , born under his guns because it couldn 't live without him .
The sister , who did the same , it was put in reeducation .
One day has unavailed a couple of Mao and , for this transgression , has been mitted to the works for seven years .
The Tibet can be insurance , but the required spirit of the popular popular is .
Finally , everything reduces to a choice .
We want to live in the monocroyed world of monotony or we want to caught the poles of diversity ?
The great anthropology Margaret Mead , before he died said that his biggest was that , in our advancing vision of the world , we 're not only going to see the whole game of human imagination of human imagination , but one day we 'll see us from a sleeping of thinking , but one day we 'll see from a sleeping of a sleeping sleeping even other possibilities .
And it 's humiliating our species is existed for 600,000 years .
The Neolithic Rivolution , who gave us the agriculture , which made us sucked us to the culture of the seed of the cler , creating the poem of the specialization , and we talk about 10,000 years ago .
modern industrialized world has 300 years .
That 's not suggests that we don 't suggests that we have the answers to all the challenges that we 'll have to deal with millennia .
When the world 's cultures of the world is asked what it means to be human , respond to 10,000 different voices .
And it 's in these answers that we all risky the possibility of being what we are : a conscious species , which has to make all the people and all the gardens can . And there are great optimism . And there are great optimism .
I took this picture on the north of the island of Baffin , when I went to the Baffin the Inuit , when I went to the Inuit , Olaya , Olaya , I told the wonderful history of his grandfather .
The Canadian government is not always gentle with the Inuit and the 1950s , and the 1950s , we rhink them in colonies .
The grandfather was refused to go there .
The family , the family , he took him all the arms , and all of his attacks .
You have to know that the Inuit doesn 't themselves the cold .
The bats of the slexes in origin were fish .
And the grandfather did not intimise from the Arctic night or the library .
It 's gathered away , it 's calculated the skin skin skin skin and defected in its own hand . When the failed in your hand .
It 's spring on the points of this crap , and when it became solid , she killed a dog .
He brought up the dog and created a shirt , with the doubt cash , created another dog dog , and it 's disappeared on the bankners .
We want to talk about cavarsely with nothing ?
In fact , in fact , 1999 government government has given to the total Inuit , the total control of the larger California and Texas messes together .
It 's their new patria . It 's called Nunavut .
It 's an independent territory . They all the minerary resources .
One is beautiful example of how a nation-state can remember with his popular popular .
And , finally , I think it 's pretty obvious at least to those of us was in these zones of the planet , remote that they 're not remote .
For somebody 's home .
They representing sections of the human imagination that rising at the head of the time . And for us all , the dreams of these children , like dreams of our children , become part of the geography of the hope .
So finally , we have National Geographic , we convinced that politicians will never get to nothing .
We believe that polected --
[ Applausi ] isn 't persuasive , but we believe that stories can change the world , and maybe we 're the best institution to tell the stories of the world . Each month 35 million lives . Every month , our website is 35 million lives . ]
156 countries transmitted our television canal .
Our magazines are lets from millions of people .
Our work is traveling in ethnosphere to bring our audience in places of beautiful cultural , where they 're going to go out and hopefs , huge , they 're going to be hug for the central revelation of anthropology : the world of exists in diversity , and multicultural world .
where the wisdom of all the popular wisdom .
Thank you .
I 'm going to talk about a few things that I wrote in this book that I hope you 've already heard of other than you have heard , and I 'm going to try to clear some connections , within the named .
I want to start with what I call " the dogma officer . "
The dogma official dogma of what ?
The official dogas of all industrial societies of all industrial societies : " If we want to male the well-being of citizens . "
The reason is , from a side , in the fact that freedom is in itself a value , useful , essential , useful , essential for human beings .
On the other is that if we 're free , every one of us can act to do everything that mass our well-being , no one that decided in our well-being , no one that decided in our wellness .
The way of massive freedom is massive freedom .
The more choices people have , the more than they are free , and more is their well-being .
This , I think , it 's so deeply radicated in society that no one would drew to doubt .
And it 's also deeply falls in our lives .
I 'll show you a few examples of what progress has made possible .
This is my supermarket . It 's not particularly big .
I lost a simple note about condition .
In my supermarket , there are 175 condition , without the 10 olive oil and 12 of olive oil and 12 acetes and the balsamis that you can buy for you a huge number of condition in the including circumstance that no 175 , already is already of your degree .
This is how supermarket .
Then you go to the electronics stereo to buy a stereo : CD , lector , lector , radio , the CD , radio .
And in this single electronics store of electronics .
We can do six million and a half of different combination using the components that there are only in a only store .
You need to admit that there is a lot of choice .
Other the camps : the world of communications .
Once , when I was a child , you could get all the phone services of the phones that were provided by mom Bell .
It was doing the phone , you didn 't buy it .
A consequence of that , by the way , it was that the telephone never break .
These days went .
Now , we have a variety of telephones , especially in the cell .
Here 's the cell phones of the future .
My favorite is that in the middle , MP3 , cutters of the nose , nose of the birth .
If you haven 't seen it in the store under the store , you 're going to soon .
And what 's happening is that people enters into the stops and asked this question . And you know , what 's the answer is " No . "
It 's not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn 't do too much .
So , in other aspects of life that are much more important than acquired than acquied the same choice of choices .
Sanitarian : It doesn 't happen in the United States , you 're going to go from doctor and doctor you have to do .
Instead , you go to the doctor , and doctor says , " Okay , we could do A , or B , " Those " have these benefits and these risks , " B " has these risks benefits and these risks . What do you want to do ? "
Does you say , what would I do ?
And the doctor says , " A has these benefits and these risks , and B has these benefits . "
" What do you want to do ? "
And you rebad , " Dottore if she was me , what would it do ? "
And the doctor : " But I 'm not her . "
The result of the result , we call it " dying of the sick , expression that makes it looks like a beautiful thing .
But it 's actually not that a move the weight and responsibility to make decisions from somebody knows anything , is the doctor , somebody else who don 't know -- and it 's almost certainly maled -- and therefore not in the ideal condition to make it decisions of the patient .
There 's a huge marketing of pharmaceutical products , direct to people like me and you , that if you don 't have any sense , because we can 't buy them .
But if we can 't buy them , why are they public ?
The answer is that they want to be that doctor , we call the doctor for the recipe .
Something so fundamental as it 's our identity is a question of choice , as you see , as you see in this view , " We don 't want to force the children . They 're going to ceat the right moment . " We don 't want to be an identity : we have to invent .
And we can reinvent us how much sometimes us .
which means that every morning , at the morning , you have to decide that kind of person wants to be .
I spect the family and marriage , a time perspective , a time perspective , almost for anybody , it was that he was married to us as soon as possible .
The only real choice was with who , not when , and not when , and not even what to do after .
At day , it 's really to play .
I teach very intelligent students , and I 'm going to give them a time .
And not because it 's not because it 's less diligent , because it 's less diligent .
but why am I impensiered , I mean , " Would I married or not ? " Do I 'm going to do it now ? "
" Would I marry later ? "
These are logorant interrogorating .
And they 're trying to respond to these questions , even though it is not to completing the tasks and not get a good vote to my extent .
And they really have to do it . These are important questions .
Now , the work : we 're lucky , like Carl Sarl , because the technology allows us to work every day , every single day , every corner of the planet , except from Hotel Randolph .
In the parent , there 's a angle , and I 'm not going to tell you what , where the WiFi works .
I don 't tell you , because I want to use it .
What it means , this incredible freedom freedom of choices that we have about the work ? Is we have to work or not .
We can go and see our childhot , with the cell phone , the Blackberry , the Blackberry in the other , and the noteaching books .
And even though they 're all spent , every minute that we see our baby boy , we 're also asking , " Do I have to respond to this called ? "
" I 'm going to say to this email ? "
And also , when the answer is no , this makes the experience of your child , very different from what it would be in other conditions .
So , at any way , we look at , small things and large materials and large materials and lives , life is a question of choices .
Once the world was this : There were some possibilities , but it was not a question of choice .
The world today looks like this : The dilemma is , " Is it a good thing , or negative ? "
The answer is .
We all sorts of positive , so I 'm going to talk about the negative ones .
All this picture is two negative effects two negative effects of the people .
The first , paradox is that produces paralysis that produces instead of liberation .
With a lot of the options between which you choose , it becomes very hard to do it .
I offer you a meaningful example : a study conduct on volunteer .
One of my colleague has access to the Vanmerd data , the gigantic fund society , with about a million client client improved in 2,000 different companies .
What she discovered is that for every 10 solutions that are being offered in more , the percentage of two percent .
With 50 sours of offerts , there 's 10 percent adesions respect when they 're available to only five . Why ?
Because with 50 funding funds in which you choose , is sically hard to decide , and the choice is remaining .
And the questions , and again , questions , questions , questions , and of course , tomorrow .
You know that it doesn 't only mean that these workers are going to have enough food for dogs because they 're not going to have enough money , you also want to say that the decision is that they lose the decision is to lose complementary the dator of work .
Don 't participating , they 're losing to five dollars from the dator of the dator of work , which would be well disposing them .
So the paralysis a consequence of having too much choices .
And I think it makes the world like this .
" And finally , for eternity : ketchup , feels , senaps or maion ? "
You just want to take the right decision , if it 's for ethernity , right ?
You don 't want to pick the bottom , and you don 't want to pick the wrong .
So this is the first effect . The second is that even though we can avoid the paralysis and make a choice , at the end of how we 'd be doing less options of how we would be with less options of how we would choose .
And that 's for several reasons .
One of these is that with a lot of confments between the choose , if you bought one , and it 's not perfect , it 's easy to imagine that you could do a different choice that would have been better . And what 's the alternative imagined us . And what 's going on is that the alternative imagined us , and the required diminist of choice ,
even when it was a good decision .
The more choices there are , the easier is easier of any detail that 's easy of choice .
Also , there 's what economists call constood called opportunity .
Dan Gilbert asked very well as a value of the value that we take things about what we 're doing .
In the rest , when there 's a lot of options , it 's easy to represent the characteristics of the options of the options of the option that is choice .
Here 's an example . I school with everybody who are not in New York .
But that 's what you probably think .
There 's this bad at the Hamptons .
A place of luxury .
Just bears . It 's all days . It 's all for them .
It 's not missing anything . But what he thinks is , sick , it 's Auguy . "
" All my neighbors to Manhattan is away . "
" I could talk about front of home . "
And it spend two weeks , from the idea that 's losing -- every day -- the possibility of parking where it wants .
The expensive opportunity is satisfying for what we have , even when the choice was excellent .
And the more are the options that we have to consider , the more the characteristics is going to reach us as cost opportunity .
Here 's another example .
This is telling us a lot of things .
It talks about living the moment , and maybe slowly .
But the most important point is that whatever you choose , you can 't do others .
The things that we don 't choose have a lot of attractive attractive what we do .
Third point : it 's growing the expectations .
I tried it on my skin skin a couple of jeans .
I 'm almost always jeans .
Once the jeans were just like , you buy them and bought them and wild dressed , they were moved , just after having them a lot of times , they started to go well .
So , I went to buy a new new , when the old those old were , and I said , " I said , " I need a couple of jeans , this is my wrong . "
And he said , " You want to want to slim fit , easy fit ? "
He wants to them with the buttons or with the buttons ? "
" Do you want to do it ? "
" Seight them wants or high ? Bl blades -- " Continured . "
I was balorrow , and after a while I was able to say , " I want to say , " I want to say , " I want to be the only like , so for a time , I tried to me everybody jeans , then I came out of eans , and then I came out of the best couple of jeans that I ever had .
It was the massive . I got the whole choices I got the best .
But I felt worse .
Why ? I wrote a whole book to understand it .
And the reason I was worse is that with all that choices my expectations were very high , the jeans had to be perfect .
At the beginning I was expectations . I didn 't expect anything exceptional when there was only a guy , but when there was only a kind of must be perfect .
What I was bouched was good , but not perfect .
After I had compared to what I was trying to do with what I was trying to do with the expectations .
The addition addition of the people in life doesn 't make the expected of the excellence of the same .
And this will produce less satisfaction , even when the results are good .
Nobody in the marketing world in marketing .
Because if you know , you wouldn 't know what I 'm talking about .
It looks more like this .
" It was better when it was worthy , " The reason you were better when it was worse is that when he was worse was worse , when it was worse was possible to meet .
So , in the world that we live in -- opulent , industrialized citizens with the expectation of perpection -- massive that we can hope is that the things are at the height of the expectations .
You 're never going to surprised because your expected expectations , my expectations are ingiant .
The secret of happiness -- what you 're here -- is , " Basse expectations , " Yes , you want . "
I mean -- a small moment moment -- which is really married and my wife is really amazing .
I couldn 't do better , I couldn 't do it .
But it 's not always a bad thing .
And finally , a consequence of the buying a couple of jeans when there is just that when you don 't satisfied , and you say , " Why do you ? "
" Who 's responsible ? " The answer is clear .
The world is responsible . What could I do with it ?
When there are hundreds of jeans , and you buy a little bit of jeans , and you ask you who is the responsible , it 's as clear as the responsible to you .
You would have to do better .
With hundreds of available variety .
So , when people take decisions , even though the result is , they feel satisfied and give the colse to the same .
In the last few years , depression is exploded in the industrialized world .
I think a significant factor -- not the only one , but that 's important -- this wave of depression is just that people have deludent experiences because the standards are too high .
And when they have to explain this situation think it 's them .
So the end result is that we 're in general , objectively , but we feel worse .
Let me remember .
This is the official dogas , what we all take for good and it 's completely not .
There 's no doubt that a little bit of choice is better than having at all , but it doesn 't have a lot of choice is better than a little bit .
There 's a critical value . I don 't know what it is .
But I 'm sure that we 've taken from a piece of the level in which choices improve our lives .
Now , from the political view -- I 've almost finished -- from political point of view , the political nocity .
What it allows you all this picture in industrial society is material .
There are a lot of places in the world , and you 've got a lot of places in the world .
The problem is that they have too little .
So the face that I 'm talking about is a sick of modern modern , recognize society .
And what it does have to get up and arrage is this : Steve Levitt talked to you about how expensive constantly and discoverage moseats for baby .
I mean these choices , complicated and dispendious , it 's not just unuuseful .
I 'm a deleteries .
It 's worse .
If a little bit of what in our society allows it was reversed in those where people have too few possibilities , it would not only have their life to improve , but also .
This is what economists call a paretian improvement .
A redistribution of the income is good to everybody -- not only to the poor -- because of this choice , because of this choices into us .
To conclude , " You can become everything that you want , "
Does , you 'll think , " What do you believe that fish ? "
" It 's obvious that you can 't make anything in a glass of glass . "
" A imagination , a limited view of the world -- "
And I 'm interested in this , at the beginning .
But then , I realized , instead , I realized that fish the longer known .
Because the reality of the fact is , if you eat the boat , so that it 's possible , " all you can 't get freedom . You get the paralysis .
If you break the boat so that all divent can decrease .
Accer the paralysis , and you 'll reduce the well-being .
Everybody need a sphere .
This is almost certainly too , perhaps even for the fish , and certainly for us .
But the absence of some symbolics sphere is a recipe for the flat and , for the roin .
Thank you very much .
