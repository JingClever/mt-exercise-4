The year I showed these slide to show the slide that the calculate glacial , which for almost three million years of the 48 percent of the 48 percent of the 48 percent of the 48 percent .
But this subject the gravity of the problem because I don 't show it the ice of the ice .
The calculate glacial is , in a certain sense , the heart of the global climate system .
You can get inversus and you reverse it .
The next slide is going to be a card of a card on the last 25 years .
The ice allows are returned in red red .
As you see , you get the blue to the blue .
And that 's the ice in inverse , that 's running , that you can get realized .
You can see that the cosidgn tiny , of five years or more , is like the sangue , is like the site , which is like the site .
In 25 years , it 's spent from so ,
This is a problem because the whole scale , the whole whole whole threatened around the ocean artical where there are enormous amount of coal congelessed that , they 're transformed in metal .
I realized to the toxity of the atmosfertic warming , that quantity could be swepppplease , to lose this point of not around .
In some laghi switches the midle is already rebulating the water .
The professoresthoresorse Katey Walter of Alaska tune is recently with a tune a tune .
Video : Wow ! Al Gore : I 'm going to be good .
A reason is that this termal exhic exhic scale , the North h .
This is a further reme reme glacial return .
The laughter had never reached similar .
This is the Kangerlussum Kangerlussuddden in the Greenland .
If you want to know how the level the level of the sea gamial to the ice , here is where we ran the mate .
These corrents are increasing rapidly .
Another the planet : Antartide , the biggest block of the planet .
The month , the month have died that the bange of the ice is in negative , and the Antarctartttartttarcttarcttice , and it 's particularly , it 's particularly rapieces .
Equire six feet of the handle level , like Greenland .
On Himalaya , the biggest block of ice , they 're going to see new laghi , who are few years ago , who were glacier .
The world 's world-recognized water will be a population of the sun .
Sulle : this ice is the source of the water of this city .
The laded is increed .
But when it diminudle , the same happens to the powerful water .
In California the neve on the Sierra Nevada is diminually .
The crisis in crisis in crisis .
The predictions , like you read , I 'm free .
The growth of sure the world 's world to a night of the incends .
The environmental environmental environmental and without precedent .
Four most numerous number in the last 30 years , you know , 75 .
This is a beautiful beyond .
If you look at it in the context if you can see the consequences .
In the last five years we add million tons of a CO2 million tons of CO2 , 25 million tons of tons in the ocean every day .
Look at the Pacific area of Pacific area , from the American American parts , and on the west of the subcontinent , where there 's a radical impoverific impoverific impoverific impoverific .
Most of the global warming warming , together to the deforestation , which is 20 percent , is the use of combustic combustiable .
Oil is a problem , and the coal is even worse .
The United States are one of the two countries with the most emissions , together at China .
And you propond to build a lot of other coal .
But we 're starting to a change of direction .
These are the projects , the annative years and some property performs of alternative verversus .
And in all way , there 's a lot of political political in our country .
The carbon industries and oil have spent 250 million dollars in the last year for the coal , which is a coal of a coal , which is a obsimate obsimulation .
The image I remember in something --
I see Natale , in the Tennessee , where I live , there was a 3.8 billion of the carbon bottom .
Maybe you saw it on the news .
This is the biggest flow of scories in America .
It happened around Natale .
The public public industry of a carbon industry was this .
Video : â™« Frosty the coal is a kind of allegro and happy .
It 's a lot of here in America , and it 's going to grow our economy .
And the coal is always more public is always more published .
It 's a good price , adorable and workers are dependent .
Al Gore : I 'm going to here is a coal part of the West Virginia .
The biggest society is Massey of the montells is Massey Coal . This is his love .
Video : I 'm going to ask : I 'm going to ask -- Al Gore , Nancy Peloid , Harry Reid -- not swasn 't going to what they 're talking about .
Al Gore : So the Alleance for the Cliance for the Clie for two campaign .
This is a part of it , a part .
Video : ALergy : ALergy see the climate change as a sery in our business .
So , our priority is to invent a great amount of money in a public health and confect the public truth and confect the coal truth .
In fact , the coal is not sport .
We think it 's a good -- it 's also a good defuel .
So not preocupateves of climate change .
Let me do us .
Video : Actor : Carbone , you 've heard about it .
So I do you a game in a stream in a craft to the coal of the carbon .
Straordinary ! The machines are a little bit of the coal , but this is the such of the coal technology .
The coal consumption is between the main causes the global warming , but the global of the carbon is going to be able to see change .
You have a look at : this is the odiern technology .
Al Gore : I mean , the high positive connetwork , the economic issue and that 's the national question .
Video : Comvil : The America is in cribe the national crisis , the national crisis .
The challenge that college all of our dependence , as the cost of the coal combustic , like the coal and the important .
Now , I 'm a new , car , a new solution for use .
Repower America : 100 percent of energy energy , in the 10 years .
A they 're going to put the America to work in the work , and to stop the global warming , and help to stop the global warming .
And so , a solution that it 's to solve our problems .
Repower America . Scopy of the more .
Al Gore : This is the last .
Video : It 's a : It 's about reaching energy to America .
One of the most fast of moving us to the dependence from the combustible combustible that killed our planet .
And it 's the future is here . I 'm here . I sole , a new energy energy .
And so it 's two : Noves for a few people who are working for a bad job .
Comvvil : Repower . It 's time to be realistic .
Al Gore : A old proverbio African says , " If you want to go to fast us , you go from the money .
If you want to go to the side , you go together . "
We need to go away , fast fast .
Thank you very much .
The year at TED fecame at TED .
And I promise to return to the car to get you to to work .
So , I know that . And for those who no , the LHC is the biggest experiment , the biggest experiment , I ever heard of the experiment .
Hubad is to remember the conditions that were less than a million by the beginning of the universe -- to 600 million times a second .
And all of this is just environment .
This is the Ginevra .
And we 're picture these mini-Bang Bang Bang Bang inside .
This is what I work . It 's called ATLATLATLATLATLATLake 's a 22 feet .
This is a specular picture of ATLASSSTLAS in the proportions .
10 ssthtember year we have accese the machine for the first time .
And this picture was taken by ATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLAS .
It 's a immense of immense in control .
It 's a picture of the first phasm of the first physical picture of the LHC , both , from the HC , and I 'm in the LHC , and spread particles in the reserved .
In other words , when we see that the picture 10 slymelttember , we understand that the machine , which is a great vitter .
I don 't know if it was this to make us more open to be this , when somebody went on Google and I 'm going to start this .
That means we had a cultural impact that we had a cultural impact .
I think a week later , there was a problem with the machine , I had to these dored dored ,
These challenge are 13,000 prints when the machine machine .
Now , the technical technical , and they 'll tell them , " I 'm not true . I 'm too sotical . "
And instead can do that because when they 're very cosidans become the challenges .
So , at least 271 degrees , at a temperature in the room of the space between stars , these kids can bring that corrent .
In one of the most of the most of the novemile of the novehicle in the LHC , there was a fect of fect .
So the file remarkable to sleep , and 13,000 prints , and 13,000 prints were meant to be a electrical electrical resistance .
This was the result .
Now , this is more impressive if you think these magnetic fish , and that 's more than 20 tons , and they 're spot of about 30 centimeters .
They 're saying about 50 magnetic .
We had to take them , what we 've done .
We repristinated and they represents .
And they 're returning all the place to their place .
And the end of the huses the LHC is is going to be new integro .
We 're going to get it , and we expect to get to judge , and we continue to get this on to discovered to find what are the universe .
Now , of course , in a way , these craft , these indebate the dibad of science and the engineering of the science and engineering . It 's easy to be able to contempt .
I think the fact that it 's so hard , the fact of the limitations , I think is the value of things like LHC .
I would like to conclude with the words of a scientist Inglese , Humprey Davy , the image , in the defesh , the experiments of his pulle , his publes , and his publes , and he said , " Nichael Farads , " Niches is not very dangerous for the ideas , and it 's not definitive , and we don 't know , and it 's not to be able to be in our words , and we don 't have to be in the new monkilled to be in the new words . "
Thank you .
I want to start to ask you to rethink about when children , gets are playing the morning .
And you know , you know how to reach them and they 're going to take them and moving them , and then learning , learned them , and they learn them , and they 're going to solve relationships .
The reasoning is proaching is proached to be part of the world we understand a part of the world around us .
So , from information , from the use of our interaction with objects , with the physical objects , and my collaborators , and my collaborator , and my collaborator , I started asking a lot of the clean , when we use a computer , instead of the mouse , instead of the machine , and then we can be a little bit of the machine , and I could have a little bit of a safety , and a lot of the hands of the major ,
and sistemard-like please ?
And the question was so interesting that we decided to be explore the answer , building the Siftable .
In a few words , a Siftable is a whole computer interactive as a couple .
In a few words , a Siftable is a whole computer interactive as a couple .
You can move with hand , can you know , " you can see the movement and they can be a race and a raise and a radio radio radio .
But it 's basically , I 'm objects , like physical , you can move it just just just ferryes .
The Siftable is the example of a new ecosystem for manipulate information .
And as hand that becomes more physical , consciously , and the other , and as hand , and they become more physical , consciously , we can explore new things , we can explore new new and different different different different .
I 'm going to take a simple example .
This Siftable is configurated to show of the video : if it include in a direction , the video raising , if you include from the other side .
These record interactive are conscious .
If you 're interested in what 's interested in what 's about about them .
If they are circumit , they 're notice and they can get a little bit .
If they are circumit , they 're notice and they can get a little bit .
They also have their movement and inclination .
We have to realize that one of the interaction of the interaction was the power of the interaction was the power of the data , to example , " a color like a liquid .
In this case , we have three Siftable , we have three Siftable and I can use them to use them to make them in the central , where they 're going to missing them .
and I can use them to make them in the color in the central , where they 're missing .
If we are too , we can put a little bit of a place .
And they 're also beautiful possibility of appears , like the languages , the mathematics and logical people where people can try things things fast , and you see the result of the result .
Now , I 'm now --
This is a Fibonacks that I do with a program that I do with a program of equations .
And we have a word of words that 's half a Scarababeo and Boggle .
Pratically , at all remember a letter in any case , Pratically , Pratically , every table , at every turn out of a letter in every Siftable , and as certain who are certainly words on a displetter .
Then , after about 30 seconds are remised , and you have a new new new new switness and new possibility to try .
Thank you .
So , here 's how children came to the Media Lab , I did it and I did it and I 've been sed a video .
They 're like a very flead .
And one of the things that are interested in this application is that you don 't have to give people many indeed .
I just say , " What 's words " I mean , " I 'm going to do .
So here 's how many people who are trying to try it .
This is our hundred younger there , right there .
In fact , it just wanted to be a lot of them .
They just just honcles , for him .
Now , this is a a card of a card of interactive interactive .
We wanted to build a tool for the appedies for the landle of the Lui is Felix .
It can insert new characters in the scene , solving the Siftable , they 're going to be lithetic .
It can insert new characters in the scene , solving the Siftable , they 're going to be lithetic .
So , it 's doing the sun .
Video : The sole is source .
David Merrill : Now , he took a tractor in the scene .
Video : The tractor .
By job ! Yeah ! Yeah ! Yeah ! Yeah ! ! Yeah ! Yeah ! ! Yeah !
So , I got the Siftable and put up nearly nearse can interact the characters --
Video : Bau !
-- inventing their story .
Video : Ciao !
DM : It 's a story with final story , and it can decide that you 're going to be slightly .
DM : It 's a story with final story , and it can decide that you 're going to be slightly .
Video : Voloy :
DM : The last example I 've got the time to show you is a tool , recently , to recently recently , to slower and exequal music .
It 's a recently recently , to recently recently , to walk music .
The Siftable here are the suons like the base , basically and the bacteria .
Each of these has four different variations , and you can choose to choose .
You can also be inserious to a sequence of a please of your please .
And it 's just doing it a slightly doing a " and a sequence . "
These are actually actually that you can control from the vive , as the reverbs and the filter .
You take a particular suit to a particular suit to enage it .
And then there are the general of the general time and fly , that they applicate in the sequence .
Look at how it works .
Video : We 're going to put a base in two Siftable , " we 're going to put a series , the extend to a series , we add the other base .
Now I put a line of a low line .
Video : Now I add you add to percussions --
Video : And I 'll put the battery to the bacteria , so I can know the effect of the vive .
Video : I can fast the whole sequence to the whole sequence the time from a land-up , or a land-up from the other .
Video : And I 'm going to add the bad to the low low more expression .
Video : I can recombining the sequence " to the flight . "
So I don 't have to make it first , but I can improvate , but I can improvement , or more corta .
And now , finally , I can sat the whole sequence the whole sequence to the left the Siftable . "
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is to build new interface , and it 's more more sounds and more sounds like our brain and body .
And today , I 've had time to show you one of the result of this lost , and also some chance we 're trying to take out from the lab .
The concept that I want to transmit is that 's coming this new generation of objects for interact with the digital media , that will bring information in our world in the way we want .
Thank you very much .
I don 't see the time to talk to all you .
I 'm a writing .
I 'm going to write books is my profession , but it 's more than that , of course .
It 's also the love and the fascinating the fascinating .
And I don 't expect to change .
But , I said , something that 's happened in my life and my career , and I was going to recognize the whole whole thing to recognize the whole job with this .
The particular thing is that I recently written this book , this biography called " Manogy , Prega , " Manogy , " the different books , the different books , for some reason , and it becomes a big sensatisitive , and it becomes a big sensatisal , seller interest .
And the result is that everywhere .
Davavion -- condamed , condamage .
They 're going to me all worried and they say , " I 'm saying , " I 'm not going to be able to do better ?
You don 't have to keep up to write for all life without power to be able to create a book that can be able to create a book that can important somebody ? "
that can important to be to be able to be ? "
It 's rassure , you know .
But it could go to the worse , I remember that more than 20 years ago , when I began to say to people -- I was a sent -- I wanted to be a written .
I won the same reaction of the same game .
And people say , " I said , " I don 't told me to be successful ?
Don 't you know that the humiliation of the killed you ?
You don 't have to be able to do this for all life without nothing that nothing to be able to die on a heart of a cumudddle of the south of love to love and fliment to the pinfrants of falysh ? "
So , you know .
The answer -- the answer to all these questions is , " Yeah . "
I 've been pattering all those things .
I always had a pture .
And I also have a lot of other things that people could not indeed .
As the algaxed and other things .
But , to look at the way I thought I was asked to be the last multimly ?
It 's rationship ?
It 's logical that everybody to expect to be spent by a job that you 've been sent to do .
But what 's there is a particular in the impress of the health care about the health health health health health health health care , in a way that other career do not do ?
How my father , for example , he was a engineer chemical engineeer and not remember of a solving in the age of activity in the living purpose ?
I never -- that blown to us , that bloblown John , how do it ?
Don 't work that , you know ?
Onestly , the engineers , as a group not cers , in the secoli , in secoli , the reputation of being high , the repsychemical replease .
We have scritters , we have enough this reputation , and not just writers , but creative reputation of all , we have this reputation of being huge extremely reputting .
And it 's not another you to look at the trial of the death of the magnifies , only in the 11th century , they died young and often to hand and often them .
And also the ones that are not suicipating data , they 're not sitting from their days .
Norman Mailer , before die , in the last interview said , " Ogams my book had killed me a little bit of the worth of the work of the work of life .
But we don 't bad at the time we heard these things , because we heard these things , in a lot of interized that a lot of interized and accepted the idea that the creativity and the art , and the art , in the end , in the end , in the end , in the end , it will be in the end .
And the question I want to take all of those today is : you 're going to sat this idea ?
I 'm good that -- because even look at a hundred a hundred me not not for anything to be good for anything .
I think it 's odiodiodist .
And I think it 's also dangerous and I don 't want to see the secle century .
I think it 's better to encouraging our big creative minds .
And I 'm sure that , in my case -- in my case -- it would be very dangerous to start to the heart I was in the way I 'm in my own own charged .
Ovice -- I 'm like , I 'm pretty young , I 'm pretty young , I 'm just like 40 years .
I still have about four decadecades in me .
And it 's very likely likely to write now , then it 's going to be right from the world as the work that I used to spent the last book .
I 'm going to schieve , because we 're all more friends here -- is likely to be able to my biggest .
Oh , Gesus , that I think about it .
You know , this is the kind of thinking about a person to start to start to get a person to start to get to the nine of the morning and I don 't want to do that .
I would stop to keep this work that we 're going to get this work .
So , the question becomes to , how do it ?
And so it seems to me , after many reflecons , that the way to work to keep up to write is to create a psycholgical psycholgical protect , right ?
I had a few way to find a safety of sure between me , and I 'm write , and my natural anxious , and my natural reaction of what I was going to do this . And as I was trying to look at the time , and I 'm going to see if I could have the best ideas to see if I could have better ideas to see if you could have better ideas to see if you could have better ideas and see if I was the best ideas to have better ideas .
And as helping people creative to make people people in the extent of creativity .
And that search me to the old Great the old Great Rome .
I 'm going to drive me , because it was in certain and then back .
Nellow Great Great and Rome -- people don 't seem to believe that creativity to come from from men men , OK ?
And he thought the creativity was this spirit of the way , and that came to a few people from a few surprised , for reasons and sunder , for reasons .
We called these divines the spiritical demultiple of creativity " . "
Sock , wonderful , they 're sitting to have a demon that else behind from the far away .
The Romanties were the same idea , but they call that kind of spirit .
And the is great , because the Romani , they didn 't really think a genius was really really really , intelligent people .
They have to be that a genius was this kind of a kind of degrees that we create a literally in the midle of a study , a little like the elfter , and that 's like the elfter , and that would come out to be able to be a job , and the result of that work , and the result of that work .
Ex-extremely -- that 's the distance of which I talk about -- that is the psychological psychological that you protected from your job .
And all of all know that was so that it was so that it worked , right ?
So the artments were protect from certain things , like for example , as a narcism , not ?
If your job was except not could take all the mercial , all of the mercial , all of course , they were helped by this genius .
If your job , you wasn 't all all colcollide , right ?
Everybody knows that was the tuges to be a very incapable .
And so people han concept the creativity in Occident for a long time .
And then the Rineasy came and all this , and naccount this idea ; we put the human being in the center of the universe , and the mistststery and without more to create a creature of the devate .
This was the main of human humanesimum and people started thinking about creativity , and the creativity of the ished shared .
And for the first time in history , you know , it 's reference to this or that artist as a very very , like a very much than a person in a person with a person in a person .
And I have to tell you , I think it was a big error .
I think that I lose someone , a simple person to believe that a recipient as the bottom , the essence and the resources of all the misters , creative , creative , inoscient and a responsibility is a responsibility to the psychologists .
It 's like to ask somebody to ingoal to ingoal .
Deform and destates the ego and creates all these ingestible met .
And I think it was this pression to have distrutt the articulated the 500 years .
And , if that 's true , and I think it 's , the question , and now ?
We can do it diversity ?
Magary to a return to a more more than the relationship between human relationship and creative .
Or maybe no .
Maybe we can cannot cancell phone of the rational pushed to a 18 minutes .
And there 's people in the audience that solved would read the public news , the notion of scientific notion , insom that they follow people to make their projects .
Probably not to convince you all about this thing .
But the question I would like to take is -- why no ?
Why not think that way ?
Because it 's more sense of all that I ever heard to explain the exaspert of the process of creative process .
A process that , as anyone who ever ever ever ever take something -- so , all here , you know , all here , you know , you know , you know , not buy reationally .
And , in fact , it can sometimes seems to look at a paranormal .
I did this meeting with the expensive recently , the extraordinary Ruth Stone , who 's been a poetesse for the lives and he said that during his childhood in the Virginia , and he was working out in the sloyed , and he was in the winia , and he was in the swites , and he was in the poetry .
I said that was like a fragorous trends .
And he came to her to her to her from the pathetic pathetic .
And he was going to get , because he was tremendous the land under his land .
He had a sold to have a sold to do that , and she words , " " By , " " I realize how a matter . "
And so it was going to house and came to the house and wouldn 't have to be another piece of card and a piece of card and a machine enough , as the trape , and the traph , and the floor and the pay the pay .
Sometimes I couldn 't be fast enough enough to be fast , and it was going to get out in home and the rotols and the poety the rotoling rotoling , and she would keep keep up through the pathols , like she said , " another poet . "
And then there were those times -- this piece of a piece of time -- there were no moments that I 've been going to be almost losing , right ?
So , he was square home and trying to look for the card and the poethy was in the witched , and then he was like it , and then she said , that was like if you 're going to be like if you slow with the other hand and the sungasse .
And he was the poethy of the code and reput it in his body and reput the page .
And in these cases , the poethers would be presented on the perfect , but the last word at the last word at the first word .
So when I thought -- it 's a run , is exactly equal , is exactly equal my process .
I don 't all my creative process -- I 'm not a conditive .
I 'm a music , and my way to work is ; I 'm a swear at me at the same time and I 'm going to get and pass to work and pass to be a goffering .
But I even even , in my head , I 've been met against that thing , I 've been meet to be .
And I imagine that many of you have the han .
You know , even if the work and ideas came to me from a certain certain of a certain certain of a certain certain of the source .
What is this thing about this ?
And how can we get to to extra us to be able to do not to do it , but I 'm very , rather , that we do it ?
So , as I look at me , the best example of the contemporary example I have is the music Tom Waiting , which I 've interview for a day day .
We were talking about this , and you know , Tom , for most of life was the incarnation of the invention of the artment of the extremely remaintain control , and to dominate these species of impulse , to dominate these species of inside .
But then invected , you get a day , and a day while he was driving on a Los Angeles , changed it for him .
And he was going to go back and all of a sent sent , this little framment of election , which arrive in his head as it does the inspiration , and the hair , you know , it 's wonderful , you know , it 's not as well , but it 's not as a hydrop .
It doesn 't have a piece of card , not a matter record .
So I begin to feel this kind of old old old , and I 'm going to lose , " I 'm going to lose , and I 'm going to lose from this song to this song .
I 'm not enough enough , and I can 't do it . "
And instead of go in the panic panic , you stop .
And then I 'll get the whole process and it was something completely new .
I 'm just going to be the skin and said , " Scuses , " I 'm driving ? "
" I 'm going to write a song now ?
If you really want to be , back in a more opports when I can take me a lot of you .
Otherwise , I won to important to be a few people today .
I 'm going to disturbing Leonard Cohen . "
And his process to change the process of changed .
I don 't work , the job was still known as a always .
But the process , and the fish that was reeased when the genius was releaved when the genius , the genius of him , the genius of the problems and liberated it to come back to where it was , to be a whole thing , and I 'm going to be a whole thing that I didn 't have to be a whole thing .
but he well-this peculiar , wonderful bizarre collaboration between Tom and this strange , and I 'm going to be Tom and exern 't Tom .
So how to feel that story that story is to change a little bit of the way I was working on and already me .
This idea , I writing me when I was writing " Manogy , Prega , and I was going to save me in a cause of the disperation that we 're working on something and we don 't start to think that it 's a worse , that 's going to be a worse , that the worse , that the worse , that 's going to be a worse , that the worse .
Not only good , just the worse , just the book .
And I started thinking about geck this project .
But then I remember to me about Tom I talk about the air and try to us .
So I took my face in the high and I recognize my moving in a swon a sat .
And I said to be vote , " Sent , what 's what we know if this book not be brilliant to be not interactly collide not to be interactly collide ?
Because as I 'm going to put all I 'm going to put all that I have , I don 't have more than that .
So if you want to be better , you have to presented you and make your part .
Okay . But if you don 't know what I 'm going to do .
I 'm going to write the same because it 's my job .
And I would like to do that I was recorded that I was recorded to me my part of the part , " because -- the end is so , OK -- secoli ago , in the willing of the North people who were sitting to the clear to the slyet of a slay , and the sacross the hours of a sland-hours and hours that they were going to go to the hours .
And they were always magnific , because the balleras , they were professionals and they were fantastic .
But every one , very , something happened , and one of these things was actually transcent reality .
And I know what you talk about what you are all of you know , in a certain point , a very formance .
And as if you stop a few time , and the ballery walking through a kind of a bral branched and not doing anything in the sun , but all of the 1,000 you before , but all the allows .
And at the improvement of not just as a human human human .
But it 's going to be accinated in the fuel in the fuel of divinity .
And when this is going to the time , you know , the people know what was called the " " At her name .
They were the hands and and they begin to slytars , " Allah , Allah , I , God , " God , "
That 's God , you know .
Curious note stories -- when the More invasered the Spppppay , and the honto their lives and the pronto change in the secoli , Allah , " Allah , " to " Olah , " , " that you can still feel in the cords or famework .
In Spay , when a pay , when a magical artist , " Allah , " Allah , I 'm , I 'm going to buy , " I was going to be able , " I was going to understand God .
And it 's great because we need to have .
But , the problem is the day , for the ballery , when you sweather and discopy that are the 11 of Martedays of Martedays , and I won 't get it .
It 's just a mortal with a gran mortal ginoccurrently , and perhaps never going to be able to assumption to the altitude .
And perhaps no cancer , I still won the name of God , and what 's what you have to do with the rest of his life ?
It 's hard .
This is one of the most pain to do a creative life .
But perhaps not to be so angotic if you can 't believe , the most extraordinary , that the most extraordinary of your extraordinary or being being from you 're going to the same .
But you just think you 're going to be able to be able to be able to a source of this squisity of your life that you have to spend up to a few people when you 're fined .
And , you know , if we think that 's all changing this way .
And so I started thinking about , and it 's sure , and it 's sure as I thought for different months in the book that I 'm going to public , I 'm going to take the time , and I 'm very , and I was going to do that .
And what I have to keep me when I feel when I feel eltent me , not have to have .
I don 't get you to . It 's just your job .
And it 's going to presenting you for your part , any could be .
If your job is balling , balls to the ball .
If the divine , I assumped to go to decide to sat a few kind of wonderful , for a only moment through your sforce , then " Our , then " Our ! "
Otherwise , you do the same tube .
And " Ole ! " "
I think it 's to teach it .
" Ole ! " " You know , only for you just had a human human heart and test tal tal , and you 'll be going to be continuously .
Thank you .
Thank you .
June Cohen : Ole !
As you know , I 've been talking about some of these projects on the human genome , what can meaning and discovered to new genes .
Now we 're starting a new way , we started digitalize the biology and now now to the biology and now now to start in a new phase of biology , we 're starting to make and sent life .
We always try to take big questions .
" What is life ? " It 's something that many biologists I think they 're told to understand a fast .
We tried different approvide , reduced the terms of terms .
We 're digitalizing from almost 20 years .
When we sequenced the human genome was going to spend from the world of the biology in the world of the world of the computer .
Now , let 's ask us : can we regenerate life , or create new life from this digital universe ?
This is the map of a little organism , the Mycoplasma genitalium , which is the smaller of the genome that can autorest in the lab .
And we tried to reduce the genome to create a little bit more small .
We 're able to put a hundred of genes of the several of the several of the several of the same .
But when we look at her mapa metabolic eye , is relatively simple answer to our .
I think , that 's simple .
But when we look at all of the genes we can eliminate , one at the time , is very improbad that can bring a living cells .
So we decided that the only to provide to provide that was sintetize this cromosom to make some fundamental components to the components to the craft of these fundamental questions .
So we started the avails of the " Poare we sent a cromosoma ? "
And I can make the chemical chemistry to produce these big molecle that we never get to create before ?
And in case , in case , we can make a cromosom , can we work a cromosom ?
A cromosom is just a piece of material chemical material .
The speed with we are able to digitalize life is growing exponential exponential exponential .
Our ability to write the genetic code , instead , and it 's pretty much better , but it 's better .
And our more recent recent result to a curve exponential curve .
We started more than 15 years ago .
The process has require many pass , and we beginning with a biothic review , first we began to experiments .
But we found that that sent in DNA is very difficult .
There are thousands of thousands of a craft in the world that producing of DNA , of the 30 to 50 to 50 to 50 lectiny and it 's a degenerative process : the segment is a long way , there are there .
So we had to develop a new metodo for a new metodo and the herrors .
And this was our first tentative , to the digital information in the digital of Phi , 174 .
It 's a little virus that kild bacteria .
We designed the framments , actually , the correction of the errors and I had a molecule of DNA about 5,000 lect-lectual lecting .
The interesting part is when we took this piece of a chemist of chemical material and we 've insered in the bacteria , the bacteria , and we started to read this code and protection .
The viral particles are releaved by the cells , are back back and they distruted the Ecoli .
I talked about recently recently the oil industry , they were told that they have certainly compress that they have certainly compress this model .
They have rereremeant .
We think this is a situation where the software can actually build the same hardware in a biological system .
But we wanted to do things in the biggest things in the big .
We wanted to build the whole cromosom of the bacterium .
I 'm the 580 miles of the craft code .
So we thought of building it in a seven of the viruses , so that we can change the seven to understand what they are components to understand what they are components of a cell living cells .
The design is crucial , and if we start with information in a computer , these are multiple computer , these have to be very accurate .
When we sequenced this genome for the first time in 1995 , the accuraturaty was a herror for every 10 miles .
We found , resequency , 30 errors . If we have that original sequence of the original sequence we never never been able to do that .
One part of the process is designed segments 50 lectelling that you can suddenly the switching with all the other segments of 50 lectable to make a little bit more small that word .
We 're going to be a unique elements here .
You know , you know that we 're in the flower of the floor .
And think of it , that we have a genetic code on four lecton four lected , and Two .
Three of those lectual letter together , they 're about 20 minods , and there 's specific letter to the lecting of the lecting ls to every switch .
So we can use the genetic code to write words , frants ,
And what we did is the beginning was autography to do .
Some are of the fact that it was not a poethy .
We designed these segments for a few of a few involved with it .
There are them to be that they reparan and put them .
And we started to assemble to be assembly , starting with seven miles from five to seven miles , unending them to segments of 24 mile , and so that you get to 72 to the lective lecting .
We have these sequency in a saving in a saving of a few sequening that we 're trying to create a very very very very very very very robustood -- like you 'll see in a minute .
We 're trying to automatize the process .
So , this seems to look at the tabellon a basket .
When we get to these very long , more than 100 mile , more than 100 mile , not grow up , not growing up in Ecoli .
It 's going to the limits of modern tools of biology .
So we 've been considered other mechanisms .
We know , we had another mechanism called recombination recombination , which in biology is use to replease the DNA to be able to to sat the DNA segments .
Here 's a example .
This organism , called Deinococcus , can assorbed three million rad of radiation .
You can see in the sudddanger like his cromosoma gap .
In 12 hours -- 24 hours is reassembled as it was before .
There are thousands of organisms that are able to do that .
These organisms are seeds .
I can live in a vacuum .
I 'm absolutely certain that life exists in space , and you know , and you know , to find new environment water .
And in the real , NASA showed showed that this is .
This is a imagine that we built by using these processes , just using these processes , just using the evidence with design appropriate .
The lived the cleets looks at the automatically .
This picture not been choiced with a microscope , but with a microscope , but with a microscope .
It 's a molecule that we can see it with a microscope with a microscope .
These are pictures that they have a drawings of about six seconds .
This is the public that we 've done a little time ago .
I 'm the 50,000 lectells of the genetic code .
It 's the largest molecule of a defined defined by man .
It 's a molecular fish sometimes to 300 million .
If we stamp it with a careful 10 without spaces , they would like 142 page , they would like 142 page .
Now , how do we work ? How do we work ?
Of course , tramitous a virus is a girl .
It 's a little bit more complicated when they use the bacteria .
It 's more simple when it 's a cell ekariote as our , as our own : you can just extract the nucley and inserve a clonation .
In the bacterium battern is instead is integrated in the cells , but we recently demonstrated that we 're able to do a transply-to a transpent of a cell cells to another and active cell .
We had a cromosom , I 've got a microbial species .
The two different are different as the men from the tops .
We add a few gene in more way to decide that I could choose for this cromosoma .
And then the scientists to the way to kill all the protection .
And when we put it in the cells was study -- and opprecise our grapprecise , you can our graph , the new cell .
And we thought we could not go to go to the landscape , but we tried to spend us .
This is one of the most mechanisms of evolution .
We found that tants that tants have added a second or a third a second or a few part , advancing in a second thousands of a thousands of a new trats of a kind .
So who think about the evolution as a only time you 're moving a gene at the time you can 't be part of biology .
And they 're also called me restription , " I 'm going to advantician .
The cell is that was in the cells not a chance .
The cell phone that we have inserit-h-hundred the cell .
And it 's expressed , and recognized the other cromosom as material , and we 're rraised with only the cell cells and the new cell cell and the new cell cell and the new cell .
It 's became blue because of the genes we 've been insered .
And in a short leave of time , all the careful kind of a kind of switness , and it 's transformed in a new species , based on the new software that we 've inserve .
All protectins are changed , the membraning , and when we 're going to go the genetic code , and when we 're going to be traveled to what we 've transfer .
Now , this could look at the genetic genetic genetic genetic , but altering the software enough enough enough sustained .
Now , I 've already explained that here doesn 't talk about genesis -- but of the property of three million years and a half of evolution , and I said that perhaps to create a new version of the Cambrian explosion of the Cambrian is going to create new new new species on this digital process .
Why do that ?
I think it 's enough of course , when we think about our needs .
We 're to go from six billion and a half billion people in the next 40 years .
Right to give a example : I was born in 1946 .
Now there are three people on the planet for each one in 1946 , in 40 years , and there will be four .
We 're going to find food now now to find food water and slightly , medicine and a half billion and a half billion people .
It will be more draw to do this for nove billion .
We have more than five billion billion , the more than 30 billion , the later than 30 billion of the ologist .
That means millions of millions of a day .
When we try to find biologic processes , or any kind of process to recognize them , will be a huge challenge .
We need to keep all the emision of the CO2 of the CO2 from these materials that finished in the atmosphere .
Al day , so , thank you to find scientific scientific , we have a database with about 20 million genes , and I like to think it 's the future .
The electronic industry only only only a dozen dozen , and you think about how many things are coming out .
Our limits here are very biological data from the reality and our imagination .
Now we have the techniques , thank you to these metods of a sintetization , we can create genomics .
We can make a big robot to build a big robot that can produce a million cromosomes at day .
Think of the processing 20 million genes or a different way to try to get the process to proach , and they can change , and then , new vaccines , we can change , thank you , and create more biology , and create more biology , and create more biology , and create more biology .
And it 's just a standard selection .
We can choose for a chance of survive survive , production , production of the carbon , production of the craft , production of the etc .
This is a few of some software programmed on that we 're working for to be able to several and design species to several species to the computer .
Well , we don 't know how they will be like they will be .
We know exactly commercial is their genetic code .
Now we 're concentrating such on the carbon of the generation .
You also saw you who realized that extract from the grate was a finite experiment .
We have carbon seconds and third generation that are going to be very rest in the coal zar of the coal , as the either of the treatment , or different kinds of butanol .
But the only way the biology that biology can have a big impact without increase without car , and limitate the cost of food and limitate the CO2 , we 're working on the CO2 , we 're working for the cell that we 're working to make cell cells that they can make this discovered , and we think , and we think , and we think of the coal of how to 18 months .
The sunlight in combined with CO2 is a metodow -- but in our discovered in all around the world , we found different metods .
This is a organism we described in 1996 .
It 's in the ocean deep deep in about 2500 feet of ebully deep the water .
They put out of the CO2 of the CO2 of the energy of energy .
We 're trying to understand if we can indog CO2 , that can be translated by the CO2 , that can be translate that CO2 in carbon , to drive this process .
So we could short we could be able to be able to be able to increase what is life is the " is life " is Nuth , " is the " is Nuth , we have the resolder , we have the whole industry of oil .
Exactly . If you don 't do that from TED , where you can 't do that from TED , where you can 't do that from TED , where you can 't do that from TED , where you can 't do that from TED , where you can 't do that from TED , where you can 't do that from TED , where you can 't do that from TED , where you can 't do that from TED , where you can 't do that from TED , where you can 't do that from TED , where you can 't do that .
It would be a main the bottom of energy .
And we 're working on the same metods to create vaccines .
You saw this year with influence , we 're always back to a year and with a dollar in less when it 's going to find the right right .
I think what you can change it 's going to change combinable to be combinable in a very much .
And this is how the future could look like change , now , the high of evolution , access to evolution with the bacteria , and you 're inside , and you 're inside , and infinally celluekariote .
We 're so to be so much better people .
Our discovered to live enough enough to live cells to try to be a cell cells . Thank you very much .
And I 'm all to show you , the most rapidly possible , some fundamental job , a few job in the Microsoft in the Microsoft in a year ago . This is Seadragon .
It 's a kind of a environment that you can interact is to local a huge amount of data .
And we 're seeing a lot of gabyte picture of digital photos with a kind of a zoom , and then , for a quick panoramic panoramics , disponing the picture of the pictures like we want .
And it doesn 't matter how big the amount of information that we see , how big these are great these collective pictures of data or images .
Most of the photographs are digital photographs , but this for example is a provide from the Biiiiblic , and it 's in the gammer of 300 megapixel .
It doesn 't make any difference because the only thing that 's limit for a very under , the number of a pixel in your screen in your screen in any moment . It 's also a very flexible architecture .
This is a whole book , example of data not .
This is the Greens of Dickens . Ogn colonce representing a capitable .
So I 'm going to show you that it 's just a ton of images , we can do something about this , to see that it 's a real representation of a representation of the test , not a picture of a picture .
It could be a little artificial way to read a book to read a electronic book .
It doesn 't you get it .
This is a more realistic example . It 's a number of the Look .
Every imagine is the beginning of a section .
And it will be the piledrive and beautiful experience of the version of a switness of a revision or a quotidian , which is for nature a molecular kind of a half plice .
We also did something with the corner of this number in the particular number of the Look .
We created a public advice to a resolutionary advice -- much more alta than that is because in a normal public -- and we 've been insered to you .
If you want to see the careful carteristic carried , you can see here .
Or other models , or even the specific techniques .
And this really shows some of these ideas to eliminate the limits of space on the screen .
We 're going to be able to put up and the few few p-up and other downests , not should be necessary .
Of course , the map is one of the most obvious applications for this kind of technology .
And on this doesn 't want to lose time , if we don 't tell we have to tell you that we have to be in this camp .
These are all the streets in the U.S. I well-spactive picture of NASA .
So we 're going to be at something else .
This is actually actually actually , from the web ; you can go to see it .
It 's a project called Photosynthree-different technologies .
One is Seadragon and the other is a visual research computer in Noah Snavels , one student of the University of the U.S. Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve .
And it 's from the web , gested from Seadragon .
You can see it when we do this kind of pattern , where we can go from a picture of a repattern to the other and have this kind of solution .
But the space of the space here has a very meaning .
Galgorithms of visualization , the computer register , in order to the place , so that we 're going to be able to the place in the obhi , and the extremendous Roccurated , and these are saving slaughts -- they 're saving in the saving . So , they 're going to see the elements of a s-de-. These are all the other other pleasure .
I don 't know if I shows you some other environment .
There are some more space space .
I want to spend up to one of the Noahhy-scort , and this prototype of Photosynthree-totype of Photosynthrow that we 've done the first time the first time , to show you what it is really the technology is the cleaving technology , the technology is not necessarily . And it 's not necessarily to look at the website . And it 's not necessarily to look at the website .
We had to worry about the ladies and saying .
This is a rebuild of the Notre of Notre Deas a Flickr , and I 'm going to digital Notice Dame in Flickr and you get pictures of the slightly , and you get pictures of these concerns , and saying . On one of these concerned to the arcies that 's a representer of this , and it 's discovered to this model .
So , they are all pictures from Flickr and they 're all college to the space .
And it 's possible to navigate this way .
You know , I never thought I would never think about the Microsoft to work for Microsoft .
It 's very gratificating this kind of a clean here .
I think you see that it 's a lot of different kinds of different kinds of different foots , from those phtowth of the phone , in the professional SLR , a number of meaning , and it together in this environment .
And if I retold us , I 'm going to try to look for those more strange .
Many of the block , etc .
And somewhere here is a series of photographs -- old .
This is a poster of Notre Dame recorrectly .
We can go from the poster to the physical vision of this environment .
The essential point is that we can do with the social environment . This is taking data from the intermemory -- from the intermemory , from how to the land , from the visual town , and I 'm all all the data together .
Everybody becomes together , most of the sound together , most of the parts .
You have a model of the land that emerging .
Think about this as a such of the job of Stephen Lawler on Earth .
It 's something that grows that grows that people hand that people use it , and the old that people who are going to be able to caught to the ethy .
They are huses with put a metaddress from other people .
If somebody 's the idea of the idea of the idea of the nome , my photos of the Notber of the Notber of the Notber Dame is a recognize of all the data , and the can use of the data , and I can use the way to be such a kind of a clean experience for a crule , and the cle-mo-mo-cle-mo-mo-mo-mo-cket cle-mo-mo--cle-mosthers .
Of course , a consequence of all this is model , extremely elaborated , in the terms of the land , I 'm not going to solved so much of the earth and images , but the memory , and the similar satelling and similar , but the memory .
Thank you very much .
Chris Anderson : I 've realized that what your software to do is that a certain point of doing is that a certain point , in the next few years , in the next few years , all the photographs , all the world , and they share that anyone together ?
BAA : Yes . What 's doing is doing is to discovered .
It 's creating hyperlink , if you want to want , in the picture .
And it 's doing it in the base of the picture .
The thing becomes very interesting if you think about the recognize of information that many of these images of these images .
As when you do a research of pictures on the web , you digit on the web page and the webswitness of the picture of the picture of the picture of the picture .
Now , what happens if that picture is all the vote of your picture ?
So the amount of interconnection and the exhibition and the amount of recognize that is really huge . It 's a very huge classic classic .
CA : Blaise , it 's really incredible .
BAA : I 'm very much .
One of the main please when you travel and one of the research of the research of research , is the power of the research of the power , between who have the past , the past in the wind , the touch in the ployes in the please plevigets , the plegen in the please , and the floating of the piece of the piece of the piece of the piece of the piece of the piece of the piece of the pacts .
Basti sciamans Jaguar travel still travel the Via Lattea , or that the monitors are still college , or in Himalaya , or Himalaya , the buddes are still fit , to remember the important , to remember the important thing that the world 's idea , to remember the world , and the idea that the world , and it 's not just a sense of the idea that the idea that the idea that we live in the idea ,
The consequence of a particular scale of a particular scale that our stroyed , well , or a lot of generations ago .
And of course , we all share the essential of the essential trators .
We all have . We all do . We all are .
We are subjects to return out of the beginning .
We need to fall to dead the inesorability of death , so we don 't surprise if we cancer and ballies --
We all have a art .
What it 's the rythm is the particular of the song , the rythm of every culture .
I don 't matter that are the forests of the Borneo , or the following the Vodoo , or the windoo , or the windoor Kenya , or the windoor Kenya , or a well-holds , or a washing wind , or a wahara .
He was my company in the desert of journey a month ago , or a month ago , or a yak in the cle of the Commolangerous , the demand the world .
Everything are teaching us that there are other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , other ways of music in the world .
And , if you reflected a business , it 's a concept that can give you hope .
And we have , the myririapappears of cultures of the spiritual life , and culture that we want to have the planet and cultual to be important for the planet and the planet , as the ragela biological note as a biosphere .
And you can think about this , the cultural ragela cultural etnosis , and you can defined the som of all the total , the total , and mitself , ideas , intuitions , intuitions , intuitions , intuitions , and intuitions , and you can be able to be from the humans of consciousness .
The thnossnaximonium is the great patrimonium .
It 's the symbols of what we are and what we can be in how much inquiss .
And as the biosphere was free consumed by the craft , and it 's been very quickly and purashed much more rapidly .
Nothing , for example , for example , it would be in the most of all the species was about the orethal , because it 's just falong -- in the most apose -- in the most apose -- in the most apose of biological inside , and you don 't even even even even even even even even even the ipose of the different cultural city -- that 's even more .
The indicults of all , of course , the language , the loss of languistic .
When you 're born 6,000 languages on this planet .
One language is not only only only a vocabulary vocabulary ,
A language is the human-human-human-.
It 's the half of the midle which animals are in the world material .
Every language is a foresta foresta slightly , a hydrogen , a chance of possibility .
And those 6,000 languages , as we sedutes in Monterey , at least half of the children 's not more sudden in the oreckles .
They 're not more teached children , the children that means , at less you won 't won something , that are already die .
What 's the longest trils of the site , the last site , of being the last to talk to a language , not so to get the sleep or to the sgegee or to ancise the test of the tells ?
This orring was the one of some of a few weeks , every two weeks , every two weeks , a weeks are moving and door and door the tombers in the bottom syllabs of a language .
And I know somebody who will tell you , " Is it not better ?
The world would not be a better place if we talk about all the same language ? " Well , then we talk about all yoruba . It 's going to be a sname .
We 're going to talk about .
I 'm going to be a tract thing to tell you to talk to your language .
I would like to do a journey , I would like to do a journey --
a little journey in the etnosfhere for you a little journey of what we 're losing .
Many of us dimented that when I say , " diverse , " I mean , " I mean , " I mean , " I mean ,
We take for example this bimbo Barasan Amazony , Amazonia , the popular of the swest , that creds to the midddle of the latest west in the site of the swest .
It 's a popular popular that 's not able to distinguess the blue , because the extremendous , because it 's identified in the foresta time .
They have a strange language and a record mathematrimonstrange , " " " " Musushing , you have to save a different person to save a different language .
All he realized in the past Mitological , ythological , is that in these families that are in these families that are talking about six or seven language , and because of matrimmmmmists no one .
They 're limited to listen and then they start to talk about .
We take one of the tribes of the most interesting with which I lived , the Waoran Ecuador , a very incredible popular , a popular that has been the first contact in 1958 .
In 1957 five missionary missionary they have a herror a very bad .
They 've done by the high photographs that they were returned them in a few people who were friendly , foresting that this populse of the foresta populse of the pluvial foresting .
They 've been told the ground of the earth , they 've been paid to the research of a site , and not find nothing , they 're going to be able to the die , and they killed the five missionary .
But the Waoran doesn 't just killed the straniesterday .
They have to kill them between them .
54 percent of the mortality was caused by them .
We 're sites to be generations and we found two death of mormorrow and when we were saying to know , they have a lot of them was invent , and then they died it , and then they killed the same .
The craft were able to recognize the urina animal and recognize the kind of recognize the species .
In the first 1980 , I was asked a company when my professor , I really did when I wanted to go to Haiti to me , if I wanted to go to Haiti to Haiti in the secrete of the power of the power of Duvalien and the Tonton Macoutes , and I can swites , and I can be ements to make me to do the fast .
So to give a sense to a sense to be a mirazy sense , I would have to understand the Vodoo and the Vodoo is not magnern .
It 's pretty much of a complex meant , and a physical meant .
Many interesting .
If I ask you to tell me the big religions of the world , what would you ?
We said , " Hysm , Islam , Budddism , Ebraism , etc .
A continent is always left out , thinking about the sub-SSaharan Africa 's not about religious religious religious . And instead is not another that the distiled of these religious concepts of these religious concepts of these things very property .
What makes the voodoor is the voice of the voice is the intense of life and died .
So , you know , they 're going to get the spirits .
And the spirits can be invest from Great the Great the rrhythm of dance and they 're going to restitude to the site of the slit , for a short became .
So , the voodoodists are to say , " You can go to talk to God .
We 're in the temple and diventire God . "
And from the moment you 're sitting , it 's the spirit that you are , how can you do you do the mal ?
So you 're incredible events , following the voice , following the voodoor in the state of trancicial infuels a rather strong demonstration , as it 's cataling in a state of the body when it 's challpose .
And all the populations with the most extraordinary populations are the Kogi of the Sierra Nevada in the Nevada , in the Colombion the Colombia , in Colombirth .
Exivilizations of the civilizations that once they live on the planning of Colombia in conquisty , the population of the slightly the maintain , the population was on the massive source that you can be on the planets .
In a macchieat-sleep of swaiting , this popular was never conquire from the spages .
And so , in the today of a cler-holding , but their formation is extraordinary .
The young people are taken by the family , and four years , and live secreated in a buy world , and live in a buy world of the base of the base of the base of the base of the base of the ice for 18 years .
Two drawings of the nove years to proposite nove countries to reduce the nine months of gestation that transrate in the mother , now are metaphor , now are metaphor .
So , they 're accultural values to values of their society , values that they predict and only their predict to their predict and just their predict to equilibriequilibriequilibriequilights .
Al termines of this incredible beginning , they 're improviviviviously bringing , and for the first time in 18 years , they see a high . And in that the first thing of the first cutters , when the solutely the worldwide , when the sun of the beautiful pathoria , all the worldly , and it 's a very conference . The predict is a very favored to the predict .
" I 'm going to be ? I said .
It 's study . Now , it 's to you protect it . "
They call them frateers and they say that we are , fratelli , we 're the collies , we are the colors of destruction of the world .
This level of intuition is extremely important .
When we think about the populations and the environment we think Reseau and the old old old story of the noble self-self-self-became concept in his simplicity or perhaps and we say that these populations are close to the Earth .
The populations are not not sentimental indebules from the nostalogy .
There 's no space for these things in the palule of the Deat or the Tibet , but because it 's going to the Tibet , but because it 's a mistics of the Earth , they created a mystics of the Earth .
What does it mean ?
I mean , a girl 's growing boys , that the montagges is a spirit of Apu that 's a human spirit to be a human human being being a human projects and will have a human report . It 's going to be a very different .
And that 's the dimouse of a high , or a mineral was irrifying .
What 's interesting is the metaphor is the metaphor is the metheless of the individual and the natural world .
I grew up in the forests of Columbia creddying that forests and serve vivisual forests .
And I realized a human being being in a human being in Korwakiutl that they create the foresture forests are the forests of Hukuk and the paradies of the paradies and the spirituals that live in the world , explained to the world , explain that they live in the world , explains that they 're going to the Hamats .
If you start to look at that these cultures can create different , you could start to understand some different discovered , you can start to understand some of the company . We take this plants .
I walked this picture in the nordoccial Amazonia .
Maybe some of you have heard about the ayahuasks , the most powerful sustained psycholing sciamong .
What makes the playahuasks the potential is not the potential to make macological potential , but his elements . It 's composal . It 's composal .
In a late , this lab , this launching a series of a bunch of a bules , bules , slightly slightly holds .
I take the sold of the plants is a fuel fuel blue that alters a little bit of the cost , but it 's myself to the cool of the coffee , but it 's mistake Psychotridly .
This makes a sad powerful powerful , very similar to serotonin , methoxyptamin-five , methoxyptamines .
If you ever see Yanomami to see the nass that they do from a different kind of a different kind of kind of a different kind of kind of contains , and methoxithoyptamine .
Tirate to the nass is a little bit like being sparated by a fucile slide of pints , and realize on a pints of electricity .
I walk often my professor , Richard Evan Shultes , the man who waiting the psycheel , with his psycheal , with her discovered in the ' 30 in Messical .
I 'm not going to tell my tiny , you can 't be a classified , because if you 're not going to tell any of a tiny , because if you 're not going to tell any of being holds . You know , they 're not going to be very , because they 're money , because they 're money in in the intention , because they 're in the intense , in the indededeal .
It 's possible to be absolutely only if you 're going to a measures that money are going to the MAO .
Now , it 's the beautiful : the beautiful : the coal , they 're in this liana , the same kind of necessary to be able to sad the same kind of necessary to sad . The question is , in a sad free free free , like these people are doing , like these people are not to find two death , but if you combine , but if you combine that if you 're combined , but if you 're going to make a very slian indeed , and it 's a lot of time , they 're going to make a sun in this is to be a parts .
We use the great eusual eusual eusual , that can revehicle .
But if we ask the Indians , they will tell us , " The plants are talking about . "
What does it mean ?
This tribes , the Cofan , the Cofan , and we have a lot of ayahuasks , which we 're going to be in the foresta , and our eyes would be in the same species .
If we ask the asking like they 're going to be like the tiny , " I thought , " I was spot , I thought I would say , " No , I said , " No . "
The solution is : you take the 17 variety in a night of a site and obnice , and obnice .
This doesn 't have to Harvard to Harvard , but it 's much more interesting to content the stames .
Now , [ we opped the problem is that also the problem is that also the people who have to be in the populations are pitting in the pitting pitting in the real world , and it beyond .
In fact , the 19th century , between 300 years , not will be remember for its innovations , but I 'm going to be a lot of how the technology was where we are stop stop and we have a deal and , we have a very accepted or accepted , and cultural destates the problem of the planet . Now , the problem is not change the problem . Now , the problem is not change .
Everything through the secoli are involved in a dance for new chance of life .
And the problem is not the technology .
The Indians Sioux doesn 't have to be Sioux when they put up and a part of the argue and freceived as American people people who put from the calculations and calculations .
It 's not the change or technology that minacts the integrity of the etnosis . It 's the power .
The duror fly in the domination .
And if you say a look at the world , I discovered that these are cultures in the world , you know .
They are living and dynamics and sspints out of the identific forces that will be going to be able to adaptation .
The patridddrive in the patria patria of the patria --
a popular Sarawak , in the Sarawak , a popular popular , a popular that he lived in the foresta generation , and now redocts to the servites , where you can see the reserved of the reflies , where you can see the eques of the hyourself in the middle of the midle , where you can see the midddddle in the middd-wouthern , where the horizing of the high ,
You get the standle standing to the foresta such land-up to the foresta foresta .
Or , in the case of Yanomami , are the disease that are coming with the discovery of the gold .
If we spot on the mountains of the Tibet , where I 'm doing many research , you 'll see the duror the political domination .
As you know the genocide , the physical extinction of a popular , but the extinction of a universal , but the destruction of a popular life , not only is conditions of a popular , but it 's not only to be a cell of the development , because it 's part of the development , because it 's part of the development of the development , because it 's a development , because it 's a popular .
And you can 't understand the Tibet , until the Tibet .
I lost the 6,000 miles from China in China , the Tibet the Tibet , and by the Tibet , and by the Lhasa sleep , but only come to Lhasa hasa slide , I 've got to be the statistics of what we feel .
6,000 monuments slands in the polls and cense .
1.2 million people killed from millions of people killed the Cultural revolution .
The purther of this girl was ascritical at Panchen Lama .
And that means that it was killed to the temple of the Chinese Chinese .
I was switness with Soulder Santity in Sancient deaths that has taken the populal popular .
Hunmer was regioned and his collied was recognized .
It was taken to take a careful in a couple of years old old old , in his gonna because it would not live without him .
The surprise , that 's been put it in the same , was put in reeducation .
And a day has been very calculated a day , a raffiguring a raffering , for this transgested , was mespecial for seven years .
The Tibet can be insopurpopulation , but the spirit returned out of the popular is from hold .
And the end , all of it 's a scelta .
We want to live in the world world of the monocromatical world or we want to get to accode the world of different different different ?
The big anthropologist Margaret Mead said that his biggest was that , in our largest pattern was that , in our love of the world , not just see the whole human imagination of human imagination , we can see the whole human imagination of human imagination , but a day we 're going to be a day , but a day we 're going to be able to slow us to be able to be able to be able to slow us .
And it 's ubillion that our species is existed for 60,000 years .
The Neolitical Right , which gives us the agriculture , which has done us to be able to the seed in the seed of the seed ct , and we 're creating the slight-year-old , creating the gerarchy of the specialization , and we 're talking about 10,000 years ago .
The modern world has been 300 years .
And the slide of history not suggests that we have the answers that we 're going to be able to be able to come to .
When these myririappears of cultures in the world is asked to be humans , answer to 10,000 voes .
And it 's in these risis that we all realize the possibility of being what we are : a kind of consciously , that you have to make it in a way that all the people and all the people are all the people of the ployed . And there are great moments of the reserved .
I walked this picture on the northern extremely , when I went to hold up to the baly of the Inuit , and this man , Olaya man , Olaya , Olaya , he told me the wonderful story .
The government country was not always always gone with the Inuit and in the ' 50 to stop our premimimidle , we have to restaged them in colonies .
The grandfather of this man refied to go to us .
The family , teaching for his life , and he took all the arms , and all the arms , and all the record .
You know that the Inuit doesn 't text the Inuit doesn 't have the cold ,
The packs of the sthers were in original patterns were fly in the patterns .
The grandfather of this man doesn 't fintimise from the test , or the puffering .
It 's sgattolated , and it 's calculated the pantalone pantales and deflow in the hand . When the old hand . When the old hand worked creating a lama .
It 's sprined on the dots of this college , and when I came to solid , and when he killed a sly-s-s-s-sun .
Howned the dog and created a badd , with the bottom , with the hythird , has imbecame a sthetic stherefore , and it 's sleep on the ball .
We want to talk about the cavared with anything ? [ Rate . And this , in different ways , [ Applauses , [ Applauses of the populal resilience of the populations of the world .
In the 1999 , the government of canadese government redied by the Inuit control of a territory of California and the Texas the Texas together .
It 's their new patria . It 's called Nunavunavails .
It 's a territoral territory . Controlly , all the resources of mineraries .
One splendisplendid of how a nation-state could recognize with his popular .
And , to finish , I think it 's pretty obvious at least who 's been in these zone of us was in these zone , it makes not really remote that they 're not remote .
So , somebody 's house .
They appecial setions of human imagination that are at the high of the time . And for us all , the sometimes of these children , like the sogers , they become part of the cloud of hope .
So , we have National Geographic we are convinced that political political constantly never arrive .
We see the polemiics --
[ Applausi are not lost , but we believe that the stories can change the world , and perhaps we 're the best institution to tell tell the world , and perhaps the best institution to be about 35 million living .
156 countries are going to be our canal cancer .
Our revilives from millions of people .
Our job in the etnossnesthnossmoke to bring our audience in places that are going to get wrong from the cutrate and , you hope , abbracing , you hope , abbracing the world of the world , the world 's the major of the world , and we have to find a lives in life in a world .
where the swisdom of all the populal populations can be collective .
Thank you .
I 'm going to talk about some things I wrote in this book that I hope you 're already hearing and I 'm going to be able to be able to sleep , in the case not .
I want to start with what I call the dogma dogma . "
The dogen official of what ?
The official of all society of all society , the dogma is the official citizens : " If we want to massive to be maximal citizens " The way to do is massive citizations . "
The reason , from a late , in the fact that the liberty is in the same value , is prevous , it 's predict for human human human beings .
In the other is in the fact that if we are libestestimate , each of us can actually get to do all of our benefit to be , without any one that decided to our benefit , without any one that decided to our ball .
And the way to massive to massive liberty the choice is massive choice .
And the people have , more than people have , more are likely , and most people are liberty , most hours is their benefit .
This , I return , it 's so much readicated in society that no one would be in the drug .
And it 's also deeply readicated in our lives .
I 'm going to show you some examples of what the progress has possible .
This is my supermarket . It 's not particularly great .
I 'm going to be a simple note to save me .
In my supermarket are 175 condments , without content the 10 variety of the extravel of the extravel and the 12 huge of the ployes that you can buy to make a huge number of condments in the inccial py .
That 's the supermarket .
And then you go to the electronic electronic to buy a stereo , lector , lector , radio , radio , radio , radio , radio .
And in this single negoties of electronic electronic ground , there 's a big number of components .
We can make six million and a half million and a half million different components that there are in a negoties .
You have to admit that there 's a lot of choice .
Altri camps : the world of communications .
And once , when I was a child , they could get all the rest phone , the bottom of the bottom of the source they were forned by mammer .
And he was record the telephone , they didn 't buy it .
One consequence of that , between the other , was that the telephone was that the phone .
These tempes .
We have a variety of the phone of the phone of the phone , especially between cellular phone .
Here 's the cellular cell phone .
My favorite is the midle , the MP3 , tuts of the nass , and forward in the nass for me , I just like me , I 'm going to be a bad .
If you don 't have seen it in the negoties in home , you 're going to take it .
And what 's going on is that people entertainly in the negospholds and ago , you know , that 's the answer is " No . "
It 's not possible to buy a cell that doesn 't do a cell of things .
So , in other aspects of life that are much more important than the exhibition , and it 's the same explosion of choices .
Axanitary : not going to happen in the United States , you 're going to be able to do .
I mean , you go from the doctor , and the doctor says , " Okay , we could do do . As " Okay , " Hoh , " A " " A has these sites and these answer . What 's the answer . What do you want ? "
You say , " Dottore , " Dottore , what I would do ? "
And the doctor says , " A has these became and these risks , and these benefit , and these became . "
" What do you want to do ? "
And you rebecame : " Dottore if she was me , what would you do ? "
And the doctor : " But I 'm not her . "
The result of the result of the maled " authonomous , " expression that it looks like a beautiful thing .
But actually , it 's not a sweight and the responsibility to make decisions from somebody knows something , you know , to somebody else , to any other than all -- and almost certainly , and so it 's not in the ideal to make decisions to make decisions , and so it doesn 't have to make decisions to make decisions to make the patient patient .
There 's a huge marketing products of products , direct people like me and you , that if you think you think , if you think it doesn 't have any sense , we can 't buy them .
But if we can 't buy them , why do you know , why do they 're going to buy them ?
The answer is that they want to doctor we want to doctor for the doctor to change it .
Something that 's the fundamental as we 've ever ever ever ever is a choice of choice , as you see in this vignize , " we don 't want to force the children . " We don 't want to be a identity , " We don 't get a much identity .
And we can reinvent us how many times we have to reinvent us .
That means that every morning , at the answer , to the answer you , you have to decide that kind of person wants to be .
I 'm saying to the family and matrimony , a time , a few weeks , and they were almost for anyone , was that was that you know , and it was that it was going to be able to make the most possible .
The only verversus was with who , not when you 're not not when I do .
Ost day , all is really to play .
I mean , very intelligent students , and I 'm going to do a time .
And not because they 're not swebslaughter , not because they 're not not saving .
But why are impensierites , I 'm going to ask , " I should slow me or not ? "
" I would like to sat me , I would think before you think before the career ? "
I 'm interrogatives .
And they 're trying to answer these questions , even if this implessons that I 'm not completely to get a beautiful vote and not to get a beautiful vote to my exame .
And they have to be that . I 'm important questions .
Now , the job : we 're lucky , as Carl sound , because technology lots of working on every minute , every day , every day , every day , from every every day , from the Hotel Randpinholds .
And I 'm a sparently , and I 'm not going to tell no one where the WiFi works .
I don 't tell you , because I want to use it .
So , that 's the amazing liberty of choices we look at the work ?
We can go to see our child playful , with the cell phone , the Blackberry in the other , the Blackberry in the other , and the ntask .
And even if they are all spent , every minute that we see our child wind the game , we 're also asking this , " Do I would answer this called ? "
" I have to answer this email ? I had to get this letter ? "
And even when the answer is " no , that 's " no , that 's the experience of your child 's very different from what it would be in other conditions .
So , from any part of the look at , small things , and big materials and big materials and life , life is a question of choice .
Ovvvvvvvvvvvvice , there was no one of choice .
The world today 's world today 's such a slimma is , " is , " It 's a positive thing , or negative ? "
The answer is Shit 's Shit .
The slide of the slide , so I 'm going to talk about those negative .
And all this choice two effects of two effects on people .
The first , paradossssis , is that produces instead of liberation .
I mean , the options of the options of the tells , it becomes very difficult to do .
I offer a meaningful example : a condot study slightly .
A colleaged to have been access to the data of the Vantuous , the games of the bottom of thinking , with about a million clients of clients in 2,000 different companies .
What she discovered is that for every 10 solutions that are offered in the most , the percentage of adesion the exion the exion the two percent .
With 50 percent offered , there 's the 10 percent in the adesions of adesions , when they 're dispone-a-only . Why ?
Because with 50 feours of the source of the source , and it 's hard to decide , and the choice is remainly difficult to questions .
And at the questions , and again questions , and I 'm questions , and of course , and of course , I 'm going to be never .
You know that not only means that these workers are handing , for the old food for cannot sold , because they don 't have enough money , it also wants to say that the decision is so ostics that they lose the worth of work .
I 'm not going to talk , they 're lost to five dollars for a year from the dator of work , that would be able to be truth .
So the paralysis a consequence of the pleasure .
And I think it makes the world .
" And to finish , for the ethernity : thernity , senape or mayonese ? "
You know , you know , you know , if it 's the right ?
You don 't want to choose the bottom wrong , and neppurpose the wrong .
So this is the first effect . The second is that we can get the paralysis , if we can get a choice , at least we 're not going to be in the result of how we would be able to be with less options .
And that for a different reasons .
One of these is that with a condments that you wake up , if you buy a lot of , and it 's not perfect , it 's easy to imagine that would be better . And what happens is that it would be better . And what happens is that happening is that the alternative , and the recognize the rest of the makes , and the recognize , and the slights the decision ,
And even when it was a decision .
And the choice is , more easy , it 's easily easy of any drive to be insudden of the option .
And there 's the economists called the economists .
Dan Gilbert asked a lot of good stamattine as the value we see things about what we 're going to do with the things .
In the rest , when there are telling options , is easy to represent the characternative exactly the treatment and be less sodden 't , and be less sodden .
Here 's a example . I school with all those who are not New York .
But it 's probably think about it .
There 's this cople to the Hamptons .
A place of the lussed .
It 's swashed to splendida . It 's all for them .
Not anything . But what he thinks is , " Well , it 's Agogogoc . "
" All my neighan Manhattan are . "
" I could talk to me about the home of the home . "
And I 'm pass two weeks , and I 'm saying -- every day -- the chance of parking , where it wants to do .
The dealugly decreating the suddddddisfying for what we have , even when the choice was old .
And the options that we have to look at the more the characteristic characteristic characteristic .
Here 's another example .
This is a lot of things .
It 's going to live the moment , and perhaps of living living in the moment .
But the most important point is that any thing you choose , you know , you know , you 're going to do not to do the other .
The things that we don 't choose to be able to be able to make less active active what we do .
Thiral point : explaining growing the expected .
I tried on my pinking a new couple of jeans .
And almost always jeans .
And once they were a only kind of a kind , they were competition and they were dissiverververse , they were just after they were just later , only after they took them a living and work a lives of times , they began to go .
So , I went to buy a couple when the old old old one of the old old old , and I said , " I 'm going to serve a couple of jeans , this is my wrong . "
And the comcommercial said , " Li wants to slem , heasfit , relaxed ? "
Would you want to be with the bottons or the bottons ? " " Stonewashed " or " hyidwashed " ?
" Would you take the word ? "
" Sott them want to be a lot of the ble , " Continured the ble -- " Continured to the wheat .
I was sbalordit , and after a little bit of , " I mean , " I mean , " I want to say , " I want to know what it was , " " I want to know , that was a very much of jeans , then used the negoties , and then , with the best pajeans , and the best paper I 've ever ever had ever .
This was the massive massive . I had a lot of the best .
But I felt worse .
Why ? I wrote a book to understand it .
The reason I was worse , I was going to be perfect the myself , the jeans were very high , the jeans should be perfect .
I began to expect me . I was waiting anything . I was not expected anything that when it was just a kind of a kind of 100 different , under , at least a kind of a perfect .
What I had to do was good , but not perfect .
I 've been talking about the choice to the choice with what I was sitting in confront of the expected .
The addition of the people in life of not does that increase expected the old of the same cell phone of the options of the same .
And this protection will be less souldn 't sat the result .
Nobody in the marketing world of marketing it .
Because if I know , I know , you know what I 'm talking about about .
The truth of the greatest truth .
" He was better when he was better when he was worse " The reason it was better when he was better when he was worse in the worse was that when he was worse to the worse .
Ost day , in the world we live -- opulent -- opulents , industry with the expection of persuals -- the massive , we can hope is that things are in the athy of the expectitiative .
You never surprising you ever surprising your expected , the myand expectative , are ingigantical .
The secret of happiness -- what you 're here -- what you 're here -- " Well , " Well , " Yes , " Yes , you want . "
I mean -- as a very self-self-self-to-aughter , and I 'm really sitting and I 'm really study .
I won 't have to do better , I 'm not account .
But you get to not always is a good thing .
And then , a consequence of the comprate of jeans is just that kind of jeans is that when you 're not going to sleep , and you ask you , and I ask you , " Why ? " Because ? "
" Who is responsible ? " " " The answer is clear .
The world is the world is the responsible . What could you do ?
When there are hundreds of jeans , and you budddrive a sleep , and you ask you , and you ask you , is the responsible , is the responsible , is the responsible , and you know .
You would be able to do better .
With hundreds of variety , there are not choose for the insuccessful .
So when people are going to decisions , even if the result is valid , they 're sitting and they slow the colplease and they sat them .
In the last years , the depression is expression in the world industry .
I think a fatter , I think a meaning -- not the only , but important -- of this once of depression is that people are extremendous experiences because they are too alts .
And when they 're to explain this situation are they think the collies .
So the end end is that in general is that we 're better better , objective , but we feel worse .
Let me remember you remember .
This is the official official , what we all take for good and it 's completely fashion 't .
There 's no a little drive that a little bit better than you 're better than not not going to have but it 's not going to have a little bit better than a little bit .
There 's a critical value , magic value . I don 't know what it 's .
But I 'm sure we 've lost from a piece of a piece of the best scels our life .
Now , from the political point -- I 've been fined -- I 've been fined -- from the political , the nocity is the following .
What you can allow all this choice in society is the rich material .
There are many places in the world , and you know , you know , in which is not that they have too choice .
And the problem is that they too little bit .
So the easy of the equal I 'm talking about is a kind of slightly , recognize .
And what it does to be to be to be a slightly this : Steve Levits talked about how those those those things and discovered and discovered to the bottom . It 's a sprepair . It 's a sprepattern .
I mean , these choices , buy and dispensed and is not just inuseful .
I 'm going to say of the eterie .
They do it .
If a little bit of what in our society allows the extremely , it was reversed in those people where people have too powerful , not only would be their lives .
This is what economists are called a better paretian paretian worth paretian .
A redistribution of the redent redded it does not only -- not just to the poor -- not only because of this choice in exception that there .
So , " Fanch , " Yeah , you can become everything you want , "
You know , people of culture , you think , " What 's what the fish ? "
" It 's obvious that you can 't get the nothing in a won a wind . "
" Hudly imagination , a limited obvision of the world -- "
I 've been interested in the beginning so , at the beginning .
But then , think , I 'm realized , I 'm rest that that fish knows the long .
Because the reality is that if you get to a handle boat , in frantum , so that , " you don 't get the liberty . You 're not going to be the paralysis .
If you 're the bottom bocks in way that all you can divent the swaiting .
Amouble you the paralysis , and you 'll reduced the well-being .
Everybody need a ssquence .
This is almost certainly too much much of the fish , and it 's very very much for us .
But the assume without a few symbolic squeen for the infecicity and , for the rovement .
Thank you very much .
