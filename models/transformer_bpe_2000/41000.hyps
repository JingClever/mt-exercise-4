I 've shown this last year , I 've shown these slides to show that the glacial calotes , which for almost three million years had had the size of 48 of the United States continental , it 's retroversions of the 48 percent .
But this subjects this subjects the gravity of the problem because it doesn 't show the ice of the ice .
The Actually , the artical calots is , in a sense , the clear heart of the global climate system .
It expands of winter and you reverse .
The next slide is going to be a quickly laughing on the last 25 years .
The ice lost are signed in red .
You see , you see , you can see , you see , you see , you can see ,
That 's the ice in the winter , which is reverse .
You can see that the cosid-old ice , of five years or more , is like the blood , which is like blood , that 's like blood , which is from the body .
In 25 years , he went from this .
This is a problem because the warming of the ground of the ice , the ground of the ocean , where there are enormous amount of coal coal , which , skip , they 're turning into microbes .
I 'm repairing totality of the atmosphical atmosphical , that amount could doubling , super-doubling , this point of not .
In some laghes in Alaska , very deep in Alaska , the metane is already bolding on the water .
The professored Katey Walter of Alaska of Alaska of Alaska , a low low messy of a team , at the winter .
Video : Wow ! Al Gore : You 're good . We 're going to be .
A reason , this is that this termal survival of Greenland from the northern .
This is a glacial reme .
The downnership had never reached levels .
This is the Kangerlussuaq , in the southwest of the Greenland .
If you want to know how it 's the level of the sea level of ice , you know , you know , where it 's where it 's where you get to the sea level of sea .
These corrings are increasing rapidly .
On the other side of the planet : Antarctica , the largest block of the planet .
The last month of the scientists have clearly been in negative , and that Antarcticks is in negative , and that Antarctica , which are pogogy on some islands , and particularly rapid , and it 's particularly rapid .
Equival at six meters of the floor of the action of the action of the action of the action of the action of the men , like Greenland .
On Himalayas , the third biggest block , you see new laghi , which few years ago were a few years ago , and it was a few years ago were glacier .
40 percent of the world 's population would have population half of the water population .
Sulle Ande : this glacier is the source of the source of this city .
The door has increased .
But when it decreases , the same happens to the powerful water .
In California the snow on the Sierra Nevada is 40 percent .
The background are in crisis .
The predictions , as you read , are falls .
The increasing secure increasing the world 's car of the fields .
The environmental disasters are increasing out of the normal and without precedented .
Four times the number of times in the last 30 years of the early 30 years of the previous 75 .
This is a whole sustainable thing .
If you look at it in the historical consequences .
In the last five years we 've added 70 million tons of CO2 every 24 hours -- 25 million tons of tons in the oceans every day .
Look at the East Pacific East , the Americas , in the Americas , in the west , and on both the parts of the subcontinent , where there 's a south impoverise in the oceans .
The largest cause of the global warming , together to deforestation , which is 20 percent of fossil fuel .
Oil is a problem , and the coal is even worse .
The United States is one of the two countries with China emissions , together to China .
And he was proposed to build many other central power .
But we 're seeing to a change of direction .
These are the projects in the last few years and some of alternatives of versus of high-years ,
Every way , there 's a political fight in our country .
The coal and the coal and oil have spent 250 million dollars in the last year to promote coal , which is a bone .
I remember something --
Sange Cerse , in Tennessee , where I live , there was a 3.8 billion gallons of coal scories .
Maybe you saw it on the news .
This is the second largest flow of scories in America .
It happened around Christmas .
The nature of one of the coal of the coal industries was this .
Video : ♫ ♫ Frosty the carbon , it 's a huge , happy .
It 's abundant here in America , and it growing our economy .
Frosty the carbon is increasingly clean .
It 's a cool price , adorable and workers are keeping the stypend-purpose .
Al Gore : From here 's a lot of the West Virginia .
The largest minerary society is Massey Coal . This is its Massey Coal administrator .
Video : Don Blankenship : I 'm going to be -- Al Gore , Nancy Peloxy , Harry Reid -- they don 't know what they 're talking about .
Al Gore : So the Alliance for the Clima Probition of Clima has launched two campaign .
This is one of them , one part .
Video : Actor : At COLergy see the climate change as a threat at our business .
So , our priority is to invest a great amount of money in a effort of public and confused the truth of coal ,
The coal is not sporous .
We think it 's clean , we think it 's a good provide .
So , you don 't preocupatent climate change .
Let 's do it .
Video : Actor : Carbon . You 've heard that 's a lot of it .
So let 's take a turn in a structure of the pattern of the coal , as it 's about coal public .
Straordinary ! The machines are a little noise , but this is the sound of the technology of coal ,
The coal consumption is between major global , but the night of coal warming , but the technology of coal warming , you see change everything .
Take a look , this is the technology of the clean technology .
Al Gore : Since , the positive alternative connects to economic question and at the national security .
Video : Homvast America is in crisis ; the national security , the national security crisis .
The field that all of us : our dependence on fossil fuel , like coaling coalong and the importantly of the coal comburied and oil .
But , there 's a new audace , a new audace solution for it .
Repose America : 100 percent of clean energy , in 10 years .
A plan to put America to get America to work , make sure , and help us to stop stop global warming .
Finally , a solution that you would have to solve our problems .
Repower America . Scover more .
Al Gore : This is the last .
Video : Comvice : It 's about re-in-in-in-in-------------------------------------------------------
And one of the fastest ways to bring to dependence on combustible that kill our planet .
What 's the future is here . Sun , only one , a new energy network .
What would be able to do is , we 've invested to be workers .
Comveepower : It 's time to be realistic .
Al Gore : A proverbial African says , " If you want to go fast , go to the wind .
If you want to go away , you go together . "
We have to go away , quickly .
Thank you very much .
Last year at TED , I did an introduction on the LHC .
And I promise to reach you to how the car works .
So , here I am . And for those that the other time , there were no LHC is the largest scientific experiment ever -- 27 kilometers of circumstops .
His task is to remember the conditions that were under a billion second of the beginning of the universe -- until 600 million times a second .
This is just environtious .
This is the car under Ginevra .
We 're picking these mini-Big Bang in the retreman .
This is what I work . It 's called ATLAS -- it 's larger 44 feet .
This is a spectacular picture of ATLAS in building , so you can see the proportions .
Ten September 10 September year we have a machine the first time .
And this picture was taken by ATLAS .
It was immense of immense festegegegegg in control .
It 's a picture of the first particles that had done this lady of the LHC , and walking into collision , of course , with one part of the LHC , and spread particles in the rely .
In other words , when we saw that image 10 10 to September , we figure out that machine worked , which is a big victory .
I don 't know if that was this to do exultent us , when someone went to Google and saw that the page was this .
What we 've had a cultural impact beyond the scientific .
A week later , there was a problem with the car , had to these dored drug here -- these dored dored .
These files lead 13,000 amps when the car works at the machine of power .
Now , the technicians between you look at the rights and say , " It 's not true . I 'm too sound . "
And they can do it because when they 're very cold , they become the cosidfile .
So , unless 271 degrees , at a unexpected temperature to the space of the space between the stars , these files can bring that corrate that corrate .
In one of the further of the most of the names in the LHC , there was a fabbricing of fabbricing .
So the files are survived , and the 13,000 printing of an electricity , they met a electrical resistance .
This was the result .
Now , this is even more impressive if you think that these magnets more than 20 tons , and that have moved about 30 tons , and that have moved about 30 centimeters .
They 're sleeped about 50 magnetic .
We had to take them , what we had to do .
We 've been restined and adverted .
They 're back all returning all of their place underground .
I mean , the end of march the LHC will be again .
We 're going to accensive , and we expect to get this data to jumped to jumped , and keep our adventure to find what the morning is the morning of the universe .
Now , of course , in a way , these incidents reaccend the debate of science and engineering in frontier of science and engineering . It 's easy to confuture .
I think that 's so hard , I think that 's hard to go beyond the limits , I think that 's value of things like the LHC .
I 'd like to end with the words of a English scientist , Humphrey Davy , which , imagine , in defense of his puppiler , the puppille was Michael Faraday , said , " Nient is a lot of human mind to progress of the human mind of how much human mind is , which is not a very dangerous for the ideas of science are , which is not a new worldangerous , and that there are not new monstry , and that there are not new world-like , and that we don 't have .
Thank you .
I want to start with you to think about when you 're thinking about when you 're , you play with the morning .
Whereas you reach them , and you can get them , and get them , and you can learn to think and move , in fact , and we learn to think about problems and spatial relationships .
The space is deeply connected to the way we understand a lot of the world around us .
So , as we 're inspired by the uses of our physical objects , together to my consulting Patts , and my collaborator Jeevan Kalanithi , I started asking , " And if we use , when we use a computer , instead of having the only a computer , instead of having the only of the mouse pattern of a digital polar , we could deal with physicists ,
and sistembing our pleasure ?
The question was so interesting that we decided to explore the answer , building the Siftable , building Siftable .
In a word , a Siftall is a big computer interactive computer as a couple .
In a word , a Siftall is a big computer interactive computer as a couple .
You can see , " they can move with your hand , they can see , you feel the movement and they have a screen and a radio radio pattern and a radio radio radio .
But most of them , I 'm physical objects , like the moroncks , you can just move them .
Siftare the example of a new ecosystem of tools to manipulate the digital information .
And as they become more physical , you 're aware of the movement , of the other , and as they become physical , conscious , of the other movement , of how we move , we can explore new and fun interaction .
I 'm going to start with some simple example .
This Siften is configurated to show video : if you including it in a direction , the video wheel , if you including on the other side back back .
These interactive ritrats are aware of other .
If I face them , you 're interested in what 's around .
If they come around , they 're noticed , and they can act a little bit .
If they come around , they 're noticed , and they can act a little bit .
They have their movement and inclination .
We then realized that one of the interesting implications of the interaction was the power to use of data , for example , " to put " a color like a liquid .
In this case , we have three Siftable , we have three Siften configure out as a bunch of color in that central , where they miss you .
and I can use them to color in that central , where they miss you .
If we 're too much , we can put a little bit of place .
They also have a great possibilities of learning , like languages , the mathematics and the game of logic and logic of logic , and see the immediately immediately .
Now , I 'm --
This is a Fibonacci I do with a equations of equations .
Here we have a word of words that 's half between Scarabeo and Boggle .
Oratically , at every turn a letter of case on every Siftable , in every turn , you get a letter in case on every turn a letter on every turn on on every Siftable , and while you 're trying to get words to control about a director .
Then , after about 30 seconds , they remised , and you have a new set of letters and new possibilities to try .
Thank you .
Here 's the children came in the Media Lab , I did this , so that they would try and take a video .
They were very much .
And one of the interesting things about this kind of application is that you don 't have to give people many education .
You 've got to say , " What of the words of words , " and they know exactly what to do .
Here 's other people who are trying to it .
This is our own willer header , on the right there .
He actually wanted to impilate them .
They were only in the moroncks , for him .
Now , this is a cardboard application .
We wanted to build a tool for the learning of the languages . And we wanted to build a tool of the languages .
It can put new characters in the scene , solving Siftable , they 're going to get them .
It can put new characters in the scene , solving Siftable , they 're going to get them .
So , it 's doing it out .
Video : The Sun 's sun-sign .
David Merrill : Now he brought a tractor in the scene .
Video : The arange tractor .
Bel work ! Yeah !
So I school Siftable and putting them up neighbors can interact the characters --
Video : Bau !
and by making their story .
Video : However !
DM : It 's a story with a window , and it can decide him as it goes .
DM : It 's a story with a window , and it can decide him as it goes .
Video : Voly , cat .
DM : The last example I have the time of show you a tool , realized , to walk and execectrouble music , to walk and exequal music .
It 's a tool , recently , to walk and exececk music .
Siftable here , they do with sound , as the basis , and the battery .
Each of these has four different variations , and you can choose to use .
You can also put these sound sound in a sequence to you to do it .
And it 's just going to touch a " and a " sequence . "
These are effects that you can check from the vive , like the reverbs and the filter .
The attacks to a particular sound , and then including to figure out .
And then there are the effects as time and volume , which we apply to the whole sequence .
Let 's look at how it works .
Video : DM : We 're going to put a base in two Siftable Siftable , we 'll add it , we add other basic .
I put a low line of a low line .
Video : DM : Now I 'll add percussions --
Video : And I 'm going to put the filter on the battery , so I can control the effect of the alive .
Video : DM : I can quencing the whole sequence of time by one side .
Video : And I 'll add the filter to the low low filter to get to the flower photo to give more expression .
Video : I can recombine the sequence of the flight .
So I don 't have to plan it first , but I can sudden it , and it 's a longer run .
And now , finally , I can spent the whole sequence with the left Siftable to the left Siftable ,
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is to build new interface new mums , more like , and more like our brain works and more like our brain work .
And today , I 've had time to show you one of the result of this path , and also a chance that we 're trying to bring out of the lab .
The concept I want to turn is that new generation of this new property property of interact with digital media , which will bring information in our world in the way we want .
Thank you very much .
I don 't see the time to talk to all of you .
I 'm a writer .
I writing books is my profession , but it 's more than this , of course .
It 's also the love and the fascine of my life .
And I don 't expect that it can change .
But , I said , something particular happened in my life and my career , who led me to get up the whole life and report to this work .
The particular thing is that I recently written this book , this biography called " Manogy , People , " which , diversity , and it 's a lot of my previous books , for some reason to the world and become a big sensationship , bestsell-interational .
And the result is that everywhere go , people treat me , people treat me as if I was convicted .
It 's true -- convicted , convicted .
They all worry about now , and they say , " You have no fear to do you not fear to do better ?
You don 't fear to keep writing for all life without being able to create a book that can important to someone that can important ? "
What can do to someone ? "
It 's very slightly , you know .
But it could go worse , except I remember that over 20 years ago , when I started to say to people -- I was an adolescent adolescent -- I was a writer .
I went to meet the same reaction of the same reaction .
And people said , " Don 't you couldn 't have succeed ?
Don 't you fear that the umiliation of the rejected rejected you ?
You 're not afrants of this summestive for all life without getting out and die on a dying of dying dream of , with the dinner of floor with the full of fallisment of failure ? "
So , you know .
The answer -- the short answer to all these questions is , " Yeah . "
Yes , I afraid of all those things .
I 've had afraid of fear .
And I have afraid of many other things that people could not have to have .
Like the algae and other wonderful things .
But , how about it was write about what I thought and wondering , I was very , why ?
Is it rational ?
It 's a lot of people to expect to be spaper by a job that they feel born to do .
But what 's there so particularly in creative impress , we 're going to make nervous about health . Or other way , in a way that other careers don 't do ?
How my father , for example , he was a chemistry engineer and I don 't remember of one time in his 40 years of activity where he was asked if he fear to be engineer ?
Wouldn 't it -- that block of the John engineer , how do it ?
Don 't work like that , you know ?
Onesture , chemistras group as a group , they don 't certainly , in the reputation of being handed in the seats , you have depressed .
We writers , we have enough this reputation , and not only only writers , but creative of every gender , we have this reputation of being huge .
And I don 't think you look at the dead of the magnificent death of the magnificent creative minds , which only in the 21st century , they died young and often .
And the ones that are not suicipate to be really dissationship by their texture .
Norman Mailer , before he died in the last interview said , " Every my book killed me a little more " A great deal of " an amazing standing " more " . " And I was a little bit more amazing .
But we don 't beat up when we feel that because we 've heard these things that we 've heard these things that we 've completely interized and accepted the notion that creativity and suffering are in some way lines and that eventually are in some way , and that at the end , at the end , will during the annotion .
And the question I want to get to everybody today is : you agree with this idea ?
It 's good , it 's good , because he looked at it by a centimeter distance to me , not good for anything this .
I think it 's hath .
And I think it 's also dangerous and I don 't want to see it in the century .
I think better encourage our big creative minds to live .
And I know that , I know , in my case -- it would be very dangerous to start at the end of the purpose , especially to be a deal of supposed to be , especially to be in my career .
And you 're looking , you know , they 're pretty young , I 've got about 40 years .
I have about four decades in me .
And it 's very likely to write that 's wrong with the world , it 's going to be judged by the way , I spent my last book .
I 'm slying , because we 're all more or less friends here -- is likely to be that my greatest my woulder .
Oh , Gesus , who think !
You know , this is the gender of thinking that leads one person to start beings to get a gin the morning and I don 't want to do it .
I would keep to keep doing this work that we love .
So , the question is , how ?
And so it seems , after many reflections , that the way to work to keep writing is to create a psychological cougical couried , OK ?
I have to find a security distance of a security between me , which I 'm writing , and my natural anxiety on , and I was trying to do it , and as I was trying to do this last year , looking through the time , trying to find other societies to see whether they could have better ideas and healthier ideas to have better ideas and healthier and healthier .
about how to help creative people to manage the inerent inerent inerent people of creativity .
And that research brought me to the ancient Great Rome .
Sewitem because it turns out to the circle and then turn back .
In the ancient Great Rome and ancient -- people didn 't seem to believe that creativity came from men , OK ?
It was thought that creativity was this spirit of the beings that came to men and that was indeed and that was a few source and unknown , for distant distant and unknown .
The Greeks were called these spirits of creativity of the creativity .
Socrate , wonderfully , he believed to have a demon that else wisdom from distant .
Romans were the same idea , but they called that the kind of spirit of a genius .
which is great , because Romanids didn 't really think that a genius was going to be someone particularly smart .
They thought that a genius was this kind of entities that was creded literally lived in the walls of a artist , a little bit like the Dobby the elfy of a artist , a little bit like the Dobby the way , and that came out of artist and modeling the result of that work .
Exctional -- that 's the distance of which I talk about -- that 's the distance of psychological that protects you from the results of your work .
And everybody knew that was that it worked , right ?
So the anti-ctouch were protected by certain things , like , for example , the narcissism , no ?
If your work was exceptional work was not going to take all the goods , everybody knew that you could help from this genius .
If your failure , it wasn 't it all your own , right ?
They all knew that was your genius to be a genius .
And so people han conceived creativity in the West for a long time .
Then Renaised the Renaised , and it was born this big idea ; we put the human being at the center of the universe above all the mistes that write .
This was the principle of the rational humanity and people began to think that creativity was completely by the ify dividoubt .
And for the first time in history , he started to referre this or that artist as a kind of a rather , rather than one person with genius .
And I have to tell you , I think it was a big mistake .
I think that allow someone , a simple person to believe , like a recipient as the source , the source and the source of all my divines , creative , unknown , and ethernal , and a responsibility to psyches .
It 's like to ask someone to inguiate the sun .
It forms and completely the ego and creates all of these inextremes on the performance .
And I think it was this pressure that was destroyed in the past 500 years .
And , if this is true , and I think that 's the question , the question is , and now ?
Can we do it different ?
Maybe back to a more , more , to be able to be back to a very large of creative ,
Or maybe not .
Maybe we can 't cell 500 years of rational thinking in a 18 minutes .
And there is probably people between the audience that would have to be lawsuspaects on the notion of the notion , you know , you know , they follow people to do spread it .
I 'm probably not going to you all about this .
But the question I 'd like to get to it -- why not ?
Why not think that way ?
Because more sense of everything that I 've ever heard to explain the exasperformance impreve-dealing .
A process , as anyone who ever tried to do something -- so , basically , everybody here -- you know , you know , you don 't buy rationally .
And , in fact , it can sometimes completely paranormal .
I did this meeting with the extraordinary poetetesse Rutual Stone , who has been 90 years , but that was a poetesis for all life and told me that during her childhood in the Virginia , working out in the Virginia , and she felt , in the poetry .
He said he was like a fragorous air train .
And that was rotates to her from the landscape .
It felt like it to get , because he was so much of the land under its feet .
He knew to have one thing to do at that point and it was , words like a math . "
And so he running back home and he was followed by this poem , and it wouldn 't have to make something else that we could take a piece of paper , and I would take it and saying it on the page .
Sometimes he could not be fast enough , so it was , and it would go back and running and poem and poetry her , and he would keep her through her and he would keep rotolating through the landscape , and he would keep rotolating through the landscape , and he said , " another poet . "
Then there were those times -- this piece I will never forget -- there were moments where it was almost losing it , okay ?
So , he was running at home and he was trying to paper and the poem was going through , and he was going to say , " And then he said , that he was like , and then he said , " What was like if you moved up with the hand and and the step .
He was going to take the poem from the tail and reput it in his body and transpitation on the page .
And in these cases , the poem would be presented on the perfect page and intact , but the last word at the first .
So when I felt it -- I thought , it 's crazy , it 's exactly equals my creative process .
Not all my creative process -- I 'm not a conduction .
I 'm a mule , and my way to work is , you know , I 'm going to get up to the same horary every day and play and go and go above and go above .
But even my head , I have stripped against that thing , sometimes .
And I imagine that many of you , the han made .
You know , even if the work and ideas came to me by a source source , I could not honestly .
And what is this thing ?
And how can we relate to it to do it , you don 't get the head , but rather , rather , that does , make us remain healthy ?
As I , the best example of the best contemporary example I have is Tom Waits , which I interviewed in a newspaper .
We were talking about this , and you know , Tom , for most of the life of the life of the life of the life of the artest artment of contemporary artist , trying to manage , to manage , to manage , and we 're going to control ,
But then I invected , he was driving up , and one day as he was driving on a car in Los Angeles , changed everything for him .
It was going to fast , and all of a tract tract this little sent of a sent , that 's a little framment of mels , which came in , you know , it 's wonderful , and it wants , you know , it 's wonderful , and it doesn 't know how .
It doesn 't have a piece of paper , it doesn 't have a match , it doesn 't have a registrer .
So it begins to feel this kind of old anxiety growing in him , " I 'm going to lose it , and I 'm going to lose it by this song lost .
I 'm not good enough and I can 't do it . "
And instead of going to go to the panic , he stopped .
He was going to be the whole process and he made something new .
He just look at the sky and he said , " Don 't see that I 'm driving ? "
" The seems to write a song now ?
If you really want to be back , back at a more opports when I can take care of you .
Otherwise , I go to important someone else today .
You 're disturbing Leonard Cohen . "
And her work , he changed after this .
I don 't work , the work was still dark like .
But the process , and the fish that was attornized when he was taken when the genius , the genius that was going to be left when he was doing it , and he remainly remainly remainly , and they were able to be a thing that he had to be an interized and turned .
But it became this peculiar , wonderful bizarring , a conversation between Tom and this strange thing , and it was not Tom .
So , how much the story I was going to change the way that story I was working , and I was saved up .
This idea , this idea , he saved me when I was writing " Manogy , " Ama , " and falls in one of those caves where we 're working on something and we can 't start thinking that it 's going to be a disaster , which is going to be a disaster , which is going to be a disaster , which is the worse book .
Not just the worst book , just the worst book .
And I started thinking about gecting this project .
But then I remembed Tom that I was talking about air and tried .
So I got up my face on the manublock and I got my common to a vacuum corner of the room .
And I said it high voices , " You get , what we 're going to get to know if this book is not going to be interacted , not going to be interacted , no ?
Because as you see , I 'm putting all I have , I don 't have that .
So if you want to be better , you have to introduce you and do your part .
Okay . But if you don 't do it , I don 't do it .
I 'm going to writing the same because it 's my work .
And I would like to please that I 've been shown that I 've been shown to do my part , " Because , in the end is so , OK -- seat ago , it 's like , OK -- it 's so , and it was saying for damances of the bunch of the bunch of the moon , dances and music that they were going on for hours and high .
And they were always magnificent , because the ballernal and they were fantastic .
But every once , rarely , something happened , and one of these artists was actually transcendent .
And I know what I 'm talking about , because I know you all saw it , at a point , a few such a point , a performance like .
It was like the time stopped , and the dance dance ballery through a kind of a bral bral , and it was not doing anything about different from the usually , like 1,000 night before , but all of a halls , but all of a dance .
And suddenly , not appeared as a human .
But it turns out of the divinity and below the fire of divinity .
And when this was happened , at the time , the people knew what was called it with her name .
They knew their hands and began to cantar , " Allah , Allah , God .
That 's God , you know .
Curious note -- when Ms invaded the South Spain , they took this habitude with them and pronoundined it , and he changed in the centuries of " Allah , Allah , " Ole , " Allah , " Ole , " the run , " which , " which is , you can feel in the corride or in the flood .
In Spain , when a artist has done something that is impossible and magical , " Allah , " the words , " Allah , " " Buh , " I mean , " I 'm a scorce God .
And it 's great because we need it .
But the problem comes the day , the ballery itself , when you wake up and discovering that are the 11 of the morning of Martedday and the God of God , there 's no longer .
It 's just a mortal with bad bad to the ginock , and maybe it 's never going to get to that height .
And maybe no one will swridge of God , and what 's going on with the rest of his life ?
It 's hard .
This is one of the most painful reconcilization to make in a creative life .
But perhaps not have to be so angoal of this angoal , if you can 't believe , in fact , intails , which are most extraordinary aspects of your being being being from yourself .
But you just believe that they 're very prested by a unimaginable source of this source of your life that you have to get to something else when you ended up .
And , you know , if we think about this way of changes .
And so I started thinking about it , and it 's certainly like this , I thought for several months during the worker , I 'm going to get a very , I spent , oh , othertherwise , I was exissible following up of my great success .
And what I have to keep telling me when I feel elected by this is , not ahead .
Don 't come . It 's only your work .
It 's involved to you , you know , any part of it can be .
If your work work is dance , balls .
If the divine , you know , you know , you know , I would have a few kind of wonderful , for one moment through your effort , for one moment through your effort , then "
Otherwise , do the same dance .
" Ole ! " " " Shimself .
I think , and I think , and I think it has to teach it .
" Hook the same , even for yourself , just for having lots of human heads and tons to give you you keep up again .
Thank you .
Thank you .
June Cohen : On !
You know , I 've already talked about some of these projects on the human genome , about what it can mean and the discovery of new genes .
We 're starting a new way : we started to digitalize biology and now we 're going to digital code we 're going to go into a new phase of biology , designing and synthesizing life .
We 've always tried to ask big questions .
" What is life ? " is something that many biologists I think have been trying to figure out out of a livels .
We tried different approaches , reduced it to the terms .
We 're digitalizing for almost 20 years .
When we sequenced the human genome was to go from the analog world of the biology in the digital world of the computer digital world .
We 're going to ask : we can regenerate life , or create new life from this digital universe ?
This is the map of a small organism , Mycoplasma genome , which is the smallest genome of the smallest genome of the small genome of the machine that can autort in the lab .
And we tried to reduce the genome of the genome to create one more smaller .
We 're able to eliminate a hundred genes of the way of the 500 genes that I 'm here .
But when we take a look at its metabolic map , it 's relatively simple to our .
I think , this is simple .
But when we look at all of the genes we can eliminate , one at time , it 's very unlikely to bring a living cluster cell .
So we decided that the only way to progrew was synthesize this crowd to be able to move this to provide the components to bring some of these fundamental questions .
And so we started the adventure of " We can synthesize a chromosome ? "
Can the chemistry conchected these big molecules we never able molecules that we never have to create before ?
And , in case , we can make a crop ?
A cromosome is simply a chemistry of the inert of inert .
The speed that we can digitalize life is growing at the exponential .
Our ability to write the genetic code , procrete , rather , procrete , rather , but it 's improve .
And our more recently , the most recent results it on a exponential curve .
We started over 15 years ago .
The process has require many pass , beginning with a bioethical review before we began to start the first experiments .
But we found that synthesize that DNA is very hard .
There are tens of thousands of cars of cars on DNA , of the letter of 30 to 50 letters and it 's a degenerative process : the letter segment is more errors , the longer segment is , more errors there are .
So we had to develop a new method to assemble these fragments and correct the mistakes .
And this was our first attempt , to start information digital information of the Phi genome of the Phi genome of the X 174 .
It 's a little virus that kills kills .
We designed the fragments , effectively the correction of errors and get a molecule of DNA , about 5,000 letters .
The interesting part is when we 've taken this piece of chemistry of inert , and we put it in the bacteria , the bacteria have started read this genetic code and producing the viral particles .
The viral particles have been requires by the cells , are back and destroyed the E. coli .
I 've talked about the recently of the oil industry , which is , of course , that they certainly understood this model .
They 've got more than you .
We think this is a situation where the software can actually build its own own own own own own hardware in a biological system .
But we wanted to do things more in big .
We wanted to build the whole chromosome of the bacterium .
They 're more than 580 miles letters of genetic code .
So we thought I was building it in a cassettes of the virus , so we can change the cassets of the seven to understand what the components of a living cell .
The design is critical designing is critical , and if we start with digital information in a computer , these must be very accurate .
When we sequency this genome for the first time in 1995 , the standard time in 1995 , it was a low mile of mile .
We found out , resequency , 30 errors . If we used that original sequence , we would never be able to be able to do it .
One of the process of the process is designing 50 letters that they overlap with all the other segments of 50 letters to build subunits of 50 letters to work together .
We try to give the only one of the ones here .
You probably have , you 've read that we put on the physical physical .
Think of it , we have a based based on four letters : A , C , G and Time .
Three of those letters together code about 20 clock , and there 's a specific order to be able to give every lots of letters .
So we can use genetic code to write words , framework , thoughts .
What we did was autograped to do .
Some of them were deluses of the fact that it was not poetry .
We designed these segments to just to join them to join it .
There are enzymes that repair and put them together .
And we started assembly with the parts , beginning with five to segments from segments , and they 're going to give them 24 thousand letters of 24 miles reading to get to 72 thousand letters .
And we 've made these segments in abundance , so we have these sequency sequency , we 're trying to create a very robust -- you 're going to see in a minute .
We 're trying to automatize the process .
So , this seems the tabellon a basket .
When we get to these very long segments , more than 100 miles , they 're not going to grow more directly in the E. coli .
It comes to the modern limit of the modern biology .
So we 've been considered to have a mechanisms .
We had another mechanism called homologue recombination , which in biology , in biology , which is to repair the DNA can be able to join segments .
Here 's an example .
This organism , called Deinococcus radiodurans , it can absorbed three million rad .
You can see in the super requarter as its crowd crowd .
In 12 -- 24 hours , it was very , like , before .
They have thousands of organisms that are able to do it .
These organisms can be completely .
They can live under vacuum .
They 're absolutely certainly that life exists in space , and moved to find new environments of water .
In the real , NASA has shown that this happens .
This is a picture of the molecule we built these processes , just using the least design of appropriate segments to put it in the segments of the segments of properly to put .
The yeast assemble them automatically .
This image was not taken with a microscope , but with a microscope , but with a regular microscope .
It 's a great molecule that we can see it with a law microscopy law .
These are pictures that they cover a six seconds .
This is the publish we 've done very little time ago .
They 're more than 580,000 letters of genetic code .
It 's the largest molecule of a defined structure of the man ever created by the man .
It has a molecular weight in 300 million .
If you 're passionate with a 10 without spaces , you would take 142 pages , it would take 142 pages , it would take a genetic code .
Now , how do we do that ? How do we activate it ?
Obviously , you 've got a virus is a game game .
It 's a little more complicated when you use .
It 's easier , even when it 's eukarios as our : you can just extract the nucleus and put another , which is basically the clonation process .
In the battery archaea , the chromosome integrated , but we have recently demonstrated that we 're able to do a transplant transplant of a cell of a cell of a cell to another and activity .
We could have a cromosoma starting from a microbial species .
The two are different how the men from men .
We 've added some gene more to decide what to choose to choose for this chromosome .
And then the skiols with the enzymes so that we kill all proteins .
And when we put it in the cell was study -- and you 're appreciate our sophisticatoods -- the new cell cell cell has been inside to the cell .
And we were we thought that we couldn 't go beyond , but we tried to spinering it in the way .
This is one of the major mechanisms of evolution .
We found that a lot of it , added species have added a second or a third cromosome , added in a thousands of new tracts to that species .
So who think about evolution as a only gene to evolution as only as a gene to the time that is not understood a lot of biology .
They have called " restriction of the restriction that even digm digerising DNA .
The chromosome that was in the cell doesn 't have one .
The cell phone that we 've put it up .
It was expressed , and he recognized the other crooks as a very extended material , and we were retromosome of the crooks .
has become became blue because of the genes we 've put .
And in a short , in a short time , all the characteristics of a species have gone , and it turned of all of a new species , based on the new software that we put in the cell .
All proteins are , and they change , and they change , and when we read the equival genetic code exactly what we 've been transfer .
Now , this could seem alchemy genetic software , but we 're going to change things in a way of substancial enough .
Now , I 've already explained that you don 't talk about genesis -- but progress to go from three and a half million years of evolution , and I said that maybe we 're going to create a new version of the Cambrian explosion that they 're going to come to create new species on this digital process .
Why do that ?
I think it 's obvious enough when we think of our necessities .
We 're going to go from six and a half billion people at nine in the next 40 years .
Right to give an example : I was born in 1946 .
Now , there are three people on the planet for each existing in 1946 ; there 's four .
We 're having problems now to find food , fresh water and clean , and gas , and gas for six billion and a half billion people .
It 's even more harder to do it for nine billion .
We use more than five billion coal , more than 30 billion baries .
That means millions of baries a day .
When we try to find biological processes , or whatever kind of , to be able to be a huge challenge .
We have to keep the whole emission of CO2 of these materials that end in the atmosphere .
And today , because of the day , of the scientific discoveries all over the world , we have a database with about 20 million genes , and I love to think they 're designed for the future .
The electronic industry only only only has a dozen about a dozen of components , and think about how many different things are come out .
Our limits here are principlally data from biological reality and our imagination .
Now we have the techniques , because of rapid synthesization , we can create what we call fight we call fight .
We 're able to build a big robot that can produce a million cromosomes a million cromosomes a day .
Think of them these 20 million different genes or to try to get the processes or to produce either the processes to produce either or drugs , new vaccines , we can change , because of a small team , and create more biology now that in the last 20 years of science .
And it 's just a standard selection .
We can choose for survival , chemistry , production of fuel or fuel , production of ethical or fuel , production of etc .
This is an instantly of some software programmed that we 're working on to be able to seat and design species to the computer .
Well , we don 't necessarily know how they will be .
We know exactly what their genetic code .
We 're now focusing on the fuel of the fuel .
You also saw you that experiment with ethanol was a finished experiment .
We have a lot of seconds and third generation that will be enough to sugar , higher value of sugar , like the eight-value , or different types of butanol .
But the only way that biology can have a big impact on without increasing the cost of food and limitarm is the cost of food and limited the displaces that can be transforming CO2 in matter , which we 're working for for designing this , and we think we can have this purpose , and we think we can have the first carbon how we think we can have this purpose in about 18 months .
The sunlight with CO2 is a metodom -- but in our discoveries around the world , we found different metods .
This is an organism that we described in 1996 .
It lives in the deep ocean , about 2500 feet deep depth of water at the temperature of water .
They put the CO2 molecular , using hydrogen molecular source .
We 're trying to figure out if we can meaning CO2 , which can easily be moved by tubes , convert that CO2 in order to drive this process .
So , short , we think we might be able to increase what the basic question of what is life is the living question of what is life is the real . We have the goal of the goal of the oil industry .
Exactly . If you can 't do it from TED , where you can ?
It would be a main source of energy .
And we 're working to use the same way of using the same metods to create vaccines .
You saw this year with influence , we 're always back of one year and with a dollar in less when it comes to find the right vaccine .
I think that we can change building vaccinable in anables .
Here 's how the future could start to seem changing , the tree of evolution , accelerating the synthesis , acceling the synthesis , and finally finally cellus eucariote .
We 're so on the best people .
Our purpose is to do enough to live long enough to try to do it . Thank you very much .
So , I 'm going to show you , the most rapidly possible , some fundamental work , a fundamental work , a new technology that we 've taken to Microsoft , in a year ago , exactly , this is Seadragon .
It 's a environment where you can interact is local level that you can interact with a huge amount of data .
So , we 're seeing a lot of digital giabyte picture with a kind of a kind of a panoramic crazooms , dealing the images as we want .
And it doesn 't matter how big amount of information is that we see , how big these are collecting data or images or images .
Most of them are digital photographs , but this is a scanning scan from the Bioowned library of Congress , and recently re-to-megapixel .
It doesn 't make any difference because the only thing that 's limits the prestations of a system like this is the number of pixel on your screen on your screen in any time . It 's also a very flexible architecture .
This is a whole book , example of data not images .
This is Dickens a Dickens . Every colonna represents a chapter .
And to show you that it 's really about , you can 't do something like images , we can do something like this , to really make something like this , to be a real representation of the textbook , not a picture .
It could be a little artificial way to read a little electronic book .
I don 't reach it .
This is a more realistic example . It 's a number of The Guardian .
Every big picture is the beginning of a section .
And it really gives you the pleasure and the beautiful experience of a magazine , or a neat , which is a lot of a half of a neighan , which is a lot of half of a half .
We also did something with the corner of this number in particular , The Guardian .
We 've created a higher high-resolutionary advertising -- much more than what you use in a normal publish -- and we put you in a normal advertising .
If you want to see the characteristics of this automobile , you can see it here .
Or other models , or even the techniques .
And this really shows some of these ideas to eliminate the limits of space on the screen .
We hope that that means to put the pop-up , and we hope to put the pop-up , not need to be necessary .
Of course , mapping is one of the most obvious applications for this kind of technology .
And on this is not want to lose time , if we don 't say that we have contributes to give up in this field .
These are all the streets in the United States , the NASA geodgathering of NASA geodgathering .
So we 're going to something else .
This is now actually , from the Web , you can go to the web .
It 's a project called Photosynthrules , which combine two different technologies .
One is Seadragon and the other is a visual visual computer very interesting , that was made by Noah Snavely , a student of Washington of the University of Washington of the U.S. of Microsoft Rick Szelelelsewhere . A great , a great collaboration .
And it 's from Seb , the Web , and he 's got a Seadrun .
You can see it when we do this kind of screen , where we can go from an image to the other and have this kind of experience to multiple and have this kind of multiple experience .
But the spaceful spaces here actually has a meaning meaning .
The algorithms of the computer have recorded these images together , so that correspond to the real place in real place that the images -- all of these images , and you 're going to the Grassules on the Mountain Roccious Roccious canaded -- they 're taking . So , you see elements of a slide-graphor , and these are all space space space space space space space . And these are all space space space space space space space space space level .
I don 't know if I have time to show you some other environment .
There are a lot more spacal .
I want to go directly to one of the original data , Noh-sit data -- and this is from a prototype of Photosynnthrow that we 've done to work for the first time , you know , to show what I think is really key behind this technology , Photosynntheless . And it 's not necessary to have been extendent with the environments we 've put in the site environments we 've put in the site environments we 've got in the website .
We had to worry about the legal aspects and so on .
This is a rebuilding of the catthedral of Notrace Dame pictures from Flickr . Baast digitar Notre Dame , and you get images of the other fields , and you get images of a shirt of these arancions , you know , you know , you discovery to this model .
So they 're all picked up by Flickr and they were all connected to spaces in this way .
And it 's possible to navigate this way simple .
You know , I would never have thought about end to work for Microsoft .
It 's very gratifying to get this kind of accohy-handing kind of accouncil here .
I think you can see that it 's a lot of different types of different phones of phones , from those of the phones to the SLR cells , a significant number , must meaning together in this environment .
And if I can , I try to try to look for those strange .
A lot of them are faces , etc .
Somewhere you 're a series of photographs -- and there it 's a series of photographs .
This is a poster of Notre Dame recorrectly .
We can go from the poster to the vision of this environment .
The essential point is that we can do things with social environment . This is now taking data from the entire collective memory -- from the collective memory of how the Earth , from visual vote -- and connects all of those data together .
All those pictures become connected , more than the som of the parts .
You have a model of the entire emerges that emerges .
Think about this as a prolungation of Stephen Lawler on Earth 's work .
It 's something that grows in complexity as the people do it , and the advantages for who are using it , and the advantages to use .
Their pictures are sea , and they put in in other people .
If someone is the idea of contrast all these saying the name , my picture of Notrate of the things , of course , you know , the picture of all of the data , and I can use it as a point of all of the data , and I can use it as a point of measure of all this data , using the photos of all the cross-model , and have a social experience of cross-model , cross-mode experience of cross-model from the cross-mobile cross-moke .
Of course , a consequence of this is virtual models of every interesting , in the earth , collecting of every interesting , and you don 't just seen airs , and you 're like satellite images , but from the collective memory .
Thank you very much .
Chris Anderson : I understand ? What your software going to do is that , at some point in the next few years , all the photographs , all the photographs shared by anyone in the entire year , they 're going to be connected together ?
BAA : Yeah . What he 's doing is actually discover .
It 's creating hyperlink , if you want , you 're like , among images .
And it 's doing it in the basis of the images .
What 's really interesting if you think about the wealth of semantical information that that many of these images have a lot of these images have to be able to be .
As you make a picture of images on the Web , you 're digital , and the textbooks on the web page has a lot of information about the picture .
Now , what happens if that pictures you connects to all your pictures ?
So , the amount of interconnection and the amount of wealth of wealth that is really huge . It 's a classic classic effect .
CA : Blaise , it 's really incredible .
BAA : I thank you very much .
One of the main pleasure , when you travel and one of the deliversial research is the power living between who hasn 't forget the anti-traditions , between who have the past in the wind stones , the past in the wind stones , drive it in the rainy stones .
And , Basti to think that Jaguar travavavigates the Via of the Milky , or that the old Inuit are still coluge of meaning , or in Himalayas , the buddies are still going to make the central evance of Dharma , to remember the importance of the Dharma , and the idea that the world that we live in sense , but it 's just a model of reality ,
the consequence of a particular set of adaptative choices that our own own own own own own own own bad , many generations ago .
And , of course , we all share of the essential trats .
We all come . Everybody 's procrease .
We are going to be retending .
We have to deal with the inexorability of death , so we don 't surprising and we can 't get out of and draw --
We all have art .
What hits is the pursuit of the song of the song of every culture .
Not that they 're the Penan Penan of the Borneo 's forests , or the following of Haiti , or the warriers of the Kaisut of the Kaisut of the Kaisut , or a camera in Kenya , or a camera in the heart of Sahara .
And he was my journey in the desert of a month ago , or a yak of the Qomolangma , in the Everest , the dealing of the world .
All of these people teachers are teaching us that there are other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , other ways of music , and they move in the world .
And , if you think , you 're a concept that it can give you hope .
And along , the cultures of the world 's cultures create a spiritual of spiritual and cultural life that we have planet and it 's important to the well-being of the planet as the biological ragela as a biological ragela of biological life as a biosphere .
And you can think about this ragela cultural ethnosphere and you can define the som of the total ethnosphere , mites , ideas , inspiration , ideas , inspiration , inspiration , bad , intuitions , brought to be the human imagination of consciousness .
The ethnosphere is the patribs of humanity .
It 's the symbol of what we are and what we can be in as a species .
And because the biosphere was a very consumed , as it happened to the ethnosal , and purely much more rapidly .
No biologist , for example , it would say that 50 percent of all species was or is on the horle of the simply extinction because it 's false -- in the most optimistic hypocalypocalycle -- and you can 't even near the most optimistic diversity .
The index of this is , of course , the language of course .
When you were born 6,000 languages on this planet .
A language is not only composed by a vocabulary or a series of rules .
A language is the pattern of the human spirit .
It 's the middle of which the animal of every culture comes in the material world .
Every language is a forest of the mind , a bacin mind , a spiritual chance .
And those 6,000 languages , as we 're here sitting in Monterey , at least half , not the middle of the children .
They don 't get to teach kids , which means , unless you wouldn 't be in something , which is already death .
What 's more saddress than the silence , of being the last last to talk a language , not to have a language , not to have a language of being able to get the sages of the children ?
This becoming up with someone in the world every two weeks , every two weeks , a few weeks , a high , and it 's a door , and it 's a very sillabes of an ancillabes .
And I know some of you say , " Don 't it better ?
The world would not be a better place if we talk all the same language ? " Well , then we talk , then we talk to yorba cantonese place .
We talk about kogs .
You 're going to cover a tract thing that means not to be able to talk about your language .
I 'd like to do a journey through the ethnosphere --
a little journey in ethnosphere to give you a little bit of what we 're losing .
Many of us forget that when I say , " different ways to existing really different ways of existing .
So , let 's take for example , this baby Barasana , in Amazon , the popular anaconda , which belief the anaconda , which believes the myth of the snake of the snakes .
It 's a popular that doesn 't be able to distinguish the blue color from the green , because it 's time , it depends on the forest time of the forest , which depends the popular time .
They have a strange language and a regle , deted of exogamy language , " You have to marry one person who talk a different language .
Everything has radical in the past of mythological , but the particularity is that in these families that they 're talking about six or seven language , because of matrimons of them , no practical matrimons , no practical .
They 're limited to hear and then start talking .
We take one of the most interesting tribes that I lived , the Waorans of the Ecuador Ecuador norder , a popular that had the early contacts in 1958 .
In 1957 , five missionaries have tried a commercial missionaries .
They did get down the picture of them that had been there in a few who were a advantage of advantage , forget that this popular popular forest , and that this popular forest of pluvial forest .
They collected the pictures of the earth , they turned to the research of a form or a figure out , and they 've got nothing that was about the diavel , and they killed the five missionaries with the lawsuits .
But the Waorani wouldn 't only killed the straneign .
They killed with them .
54 percent of the mortality was caused by themselves .
We were at all eight generations and we found two cases of natural death and when we stand to know , they admit to know , they admitted that one of them was aging , and then they killed him . They were killed with incredible knowledge of the forest .
The cters could recognize the animal hunters of 40 steps and to recognize the species .
In the early 1980s , I was assigned a very interesting tassigned when I was Harvard , asked me if I wanted to go to Haiti to Haiti me to get intruly in the society of the Duvalier and Tonton Macoues , and impossessing me to get zombies .
To give a sense of miraculous sense , I should have to understand the Vodouth culture , and that Voodoo is not magic .
It 's pretty much of a complex metaphysical vision of the world .
Very interesting .
If I asked you to tell me the big religions of the world , what would you say ?
Christianity , Islam , Buddhhhism , etc .
A continent is always left out , thinking that the sub-Saharan Africa has not religious . And instead of them . And instead of these religious religious concepts of these religious concepts of these very profound profound nated by profound tragic trial deep seaving .
What 's interesting to vote is the intense relationship between life and death .
So , you know , they live the spirits .
The spirits can be invited by the Great Acqua , they respond to dance the dance of dance and replaced temporary to the soul of the vive vive to be the following following the following following is the following following .
So , the vooodooists love to say , " You know , " You go to church God .
We saying in the temple and divent God .
And the moment you 're going to be , is the spirit that you 're driving you , as you can do the evil ?
So you 're seeing these incredible events : following voodoor in state of trance , that would touch a demonstration rather strong demonstration , rather strong of the mind of the body in the body that 's been catalyed in a state of extreme , excitement .
On all the popular people with the extraordinary the most extraordinary of Sierra Nevada Nevada de Santa Marta Nevada , in Colombia sectentrional sectentrional sectentrional .
Except of the ancient civilization that once lived on caraibic planets of the Colombic plug in the waiting of the conquering of the wind , which is re-in-hand-hand-up plug .
In a macy continent mackicked continent , this popular popular never been conquered by the spageship .
They have governed by a clered , but their formation is very extraordinary .
The young people following out of the families at three or four , and live secregated in a world that I have made of stone of stone of stone of stone , in the ice for 18 years .
Two periods of nine years of proposed to reproduce the nine months of gestation that spent in the user of the mother of the mother of the Great Mother .
So , that time , they get acculturated to the values of their society , values that they predict and only their predict and their predict , they keep the cost ecological .
On the earth of this incredible initiation , they 're sudden , and for the first time in life , at age of them , at the age of 18 , they see a high . And in that moment of the first wrong , when the sun backyes , the sun beautiful valley , everything that they learned in theory , it 's confirm about the splanding of this splending theory . The predicted one step does a step back and says .
" Same ? I 'm like I said .
It 's amazing . It 's about you protect it . "
They call the bigger brothers and say that we , brothers , we 're the collecting of the destruction of the world .
This is intuition is extremely important .
When we think about the ingene populations and we 're environment in the environment , we 're sadvance , which is a razy razy , which is a razy razy razy in his simplicity or perhaps we 're closer to the Earth .
The popular Ingenious populs are not feeling in the nostalogy .
There 's no space for these things in the malaria of the Aststops , in the winds of the Tibet , but through the time and rhyans , they created a mystical of the Earth 's not about the concept of being known , but on a block of the knowledge of human consciousness . The concept that the Earth can only live only because it 's consciousness of human consciousness .
What does it mean ?
It 's a boy of the Ande that a boy of the Ande that mountain is a beautiful human spirit . And it 's going to be a destiny different human beings , and it 's going to be a different depink , and it 's going to have a different rock , and that place to be a mmass of a rock , and they grow that a massive mountain masse mountain , you know , to be scared .
That 's the dimutual of one or a mineral city is irrelevant .
What 's interesting is the metaphor that defines the report of the individual and the natural world .
I grew up in the forests of the Britannica credating that the forest of the forest Columbia Buily-served Columbia Builbia forest British Columbia Britannica Britannica credating that the forests of the forest Columbia forest British Columbia forest of the forests of the Britannica credates that the forest to be cut .
And what made me is a different human being from my friends Kwakiutl who believe that the forests are the Hukuk 's dimora of Hukuk and the beak of paradise and the dogs that live forest, the spirits of the world , spirits that live on the extreme in the Hamateed beginning at the Hamatework .
If you start to look at these cultures can create different reality , you can start to understand some of their sensational discoveries . We make this plant .
I 've taken this picture to open in the Nororse Amazon .
Maybe some of you 've heard of the ayahuash , the most powerful substance of the sciamanic repertoire .
What makes the playahuash is not the physical potential of the substance of the substance , but her elements . It 's two elements .
On a hand , this leaving leaving a series of Tiels , hares and harm-of-cooking , slightly hallucinogenes .
Take the only plant plant , you have a blue smoke that I can hear the consciousness , but it 's miscale of a coffee of the Psychotria of the Psychotria .
This plant contains switch , very similar to serotonin , dimethoxiyltryltryltryltryltryltryltryltryltryltrylenyltryltryltryltryltryltryltryltryltrylenic , five , methoxine-methoxine-five-to-to-methoxial , methoxyltryltryltryltryltryltryltryltryltryltryltryltryltryltryltryltryltry-five ,
If you ever see the Yanomami , you 're going to see the nass that make a different set of species , anchy , it contains methoxyltryltryltryltryltrylesides .
And we 're going to get that while , it 's a little bit like being dissolve by a piece of deploads and land land on a sea of electricity .
I had often with my professor , Richard Evan Shultes , the man who wake the was psychedelic , with his discovery of the psychedelic fungi in the 1930 1930 in Mexico .
I think my thesis , you can 't classify these tripamineery , because if you can 't tell anybody to be told anybody to be trained . And they can 't tell any of being hallucinated . And they can 't be horly hury because they 're money from a physicious , detailed by a monoth-oxide , which is naturally in the intestine monoxide .
It 's possible to absumerely if you 're just if you 're assume with other chemical substances that denaturate MAO .
Now , the beautiful : crazy carboline that are in this lian MAO , the same kind of the same kind of necessary to be able to be able to triploy-popular source . The spontaneous question : in one 80,000 species of plants , like these popular populations , like this , create a way , create a biochemies that are summmmma on the submmous parts ?
We use the big eulied of the mistake and error , which can be infruttify .
But if we ask the Indians , they 'll tell us , " The plant plant plant is . "
What does it mean ?
This tribe , the cofan , the cophan , the Huahuash , which are given nectors in the forest , and that our eyes would be going to be in the forest species .
If we ask them how they do they stay their tasonommas , they say , " I thought I was a little bit of plants , you don 't know ? "
The solution is : you take the 17 varieties in a night of moon , and each night with a little bit different .
With this doesn 't have Harvard , but it 's much more interesting to that contate stams .
Now , [ the ] thing is that even those of us who have at heart people who are in the ingenes that are painting , but in a reddopted way to the sea story of the real world , and pass .
In fact , the 20th century , between 300 years , it 's not going to be remembered for its wars or innovations , but rather like the era that was where we were stopped and we have huntered activity of biological diversity of biological diversity of biological diversity of biological diversity and cultural diversity of the planet . Now , the problem is not the change .
All cultures through the centuries have been involved in a dance for new chance of life .
And the problem is not technology .
The Indians Sioux didn 't stop being Sioux when they put out of the arrot and further as the Americans have not stopped to be Americans when they put out of being Americans when they put out of horse and .
It 's not the change or technology that they threat integrity of ethnosphere . It 's the power .
The tough of the domination .
And if you look at the world , you 'll find that these are not destined cultures that are not destined cultures .
They are living and dynamics and dynamics dynamics out of the identifiable to be beyond their ability to adaptation .
And that 's tracts of disboscaring in the Penan People --
a popular popular noy-e-the-Sarak , a popular popular who lived free in the forest until a generation ago , and now reduced to the service and prostitution on the reduction of the rive red-free . And the naveled by the way of the Borneo the Merian , where the naves of the Meridiary , where the naves the orizlumind ,
and you can take the wood of the forest wood to the forest .
Or in the case of Yanomami , are the disease that have come with the gold .
If we move on the mountains of the Tibet , where I 'm doing many research , you 'll see the hard of the political domination .
As you know the genocide , the physical extinction of a popular popular , but the ethnocide , the destruction of the living living of a popular lives of a popular living of a popular living in environments , because it 's part of the strategy development .
And you can 't understand the suffering of the Tibet until you start .
I lost the 6,000 miles from China in Western China through the South East Tibet , and in Lhasa with a young lines , but only came to Lhasa , I realized what 's behind we 've figure out what 's behind is behind we feel about .
6,000 sacres sacred to dust and fly .
1.2 million people killed by military military during the Cultural Rivolution .
The father of this guy was ascritical at the Panchen Lama .
which means that it was killed to the time of the Chinese Inasion .
His the clusted with Sua Santity of the diaspe that led to the popular in Nepal .
His mother been impresoned and her colpurposes was to be rich .
It was brought to be heard of two years , hidden age under his gonna because it wouldn 't live without him .
The sister , who made the same , was put in reeducation .
And he wearing a day fashion a raffiguring fashion , and this transgression , was mession to a lot of forced for seven years .
The Tibet can be insured , but the reference of the People are holding .
And then , all , it reduced to a choice .
We want to live in the monocromationship world , we want to acknowledge the poly-diversity ?
The big anthropologia Margaret Mead , before he died the largest pursuing of the world , we 're in our way to go to this love of the world , we 're not only going to see the whole gamma of human imagination , but one day we 'll be able to a construction of the songuise , but one day we 'll get from a sleeping of a sleeping sononto forget there .
And it 's umiliating our species is existed for 600,000 years .
The Neolitic Revolution , who given us agriculture , which made us to the cult of the seed cult , and replacing the poem of the seed of the clerarchia , and we talk about 10,000 years ago .
The modern industrialized world has 300 years .
That shelter of the story , not suggests that we have the answers to all the challenges that we have to deal with the millennia to come .
When these are the cultures of the world is asked what it means to be human , they respond to be human , they respond to 10,000 different voices .
And it 's in these answers that we all risky the possibility of being what we are : a conscious species , which is to make all the people and all the people can truly trards can do .
I 've taken this picture on the north of the island of Baffin the isola , when I went to the Inuit , and this man , Olaya , Olaya , Olaya , Olaya , tells me the wonderful story of her grandfather .
The canaw was not always kind of the Inuit and in the 1950s and in the 1950s to stain the 1950s to stay our surface , we 've running colonies .
The grandfather of this man was refused to go .
The family , I temistake him , and took them all the arms , and all of his attacks .
You have to know that Inuit doesn 't have cold , the cold , exploit .
The bats of the sleeps in origin were made of cartoon of cartoon .
The grandfather of this man didn 't intimise from the Arctic night or the libraries that he was suffering .
It 's gattaculated , they bought the pantalone , and defected in his hand defected in your hand . When the I did congelated her hand . When the I did the bad blue .
He spring on the points of this cables and when it became solid , he killed a dog .
He scared , and he created a brid , with the house housing , and created another dog created another dog , and bunch another dog on the bankey , and it 's disappeared on the bankers .
We want to talk about cavaring with nothing ?
In the Canadian government of the canaw of the Canadian government of the total control of a larger territory area of California and Texas , and the Texas , and the Texas , messes together .
It 's their new patria . It 's called Nunavuility .
It 's an independent term . They control all the minerary resources .
One of how a nation-state state could remember with his people .
And , finally obvious , I think it 's pretty obvious at least at who of us was in these hundred of the planet , remote that they 're not at remote .
For someone is home .
They represent sections of the human imagination that they are at the high of the time . And for us all , the dreams of these children , as the dreams of these children , becoming part of the hope .
And in finally , we have to be in National Geographic , we are convinced that politicians will never get to nothing .
We think polemies --
[ Applauses ] they 're not persuasive , but we believe that stories can change the world , and maybe we 're the best institution to tell the world , and maybe we 're the best institution to tell the world . Each our site . Every our site . Every , our website .
156 countries transmitted our television .
Our reviews are literally laughed by millions of people .
Our work is travel to bring our audience in the way of wonders of cultural wonders that they 're going to go out and , hopefult-hug , they will abbraced by the central revealed , they will be able to get our own source in a pluralistic world , and we have to find a multiculticultural world . And we have to find a lifestyle in a multiculticultural world
where the wisdom of all the people can contributing to our collective well-being .
Thank you .
I 'm going to talk about some things I wrote in this book that I hope you 've already heard of it , and I will try to get some connects , in case , you don 't notice .
I 'd like to start with what I call " the " official dogma . "
The dogma official dogma : The dogma dogma dogma : The dogma dogma : The dogma official dogma : " What
The dogma official of all the Western society dogma : " If we want to male the male of our citizens , " If we want to male our citizens . "
The reason is , from a side , in the fact that freedom is in itself a value , is precious , useful , essential for human beings .
And the other one is that if we 're free , each of us can act for it to do everything that massive , to do everything that massive , our weleleless , without any decided to our welelelsewhere .
The way to massive freedom is to massive freedom .
The more choices people have , the more , the more are free , and more , is their well-being .
This , I think , it 's so deeply radicated in society that no one would dream to doubt .
And it 's also deeply radical in our lives .
I 'm going to show you some examples of what progress has made possible .
This is my supermarket . It 's not particularly big .
I 'm a simple note about conditivegetable .
In my supermarket , there are 175 conditions , without contate 10 variety of oil and the 12 aceps of oil and 12 aceps , and the 12 aceps of them , you can buy to make a huge number of constantly in the surroundry cirance that no one of the 175 , already of your degree .
Here 's what supermarket .
Then go to the electronic stereo to buy a stereo stereo , CD , lector , radio , radio , priner , the priner .
And in this single electronic negotie , there 's a big number of audio components .
We can do six and a half million different of combination using the components that there are only one negoties in one store .
You have to admit that there 's a lot of choice .
The camps : the world of communications .
And once I was a child , they could get all of the phone services , and they could get all the phone services that were provided by mom Bell .
And she was doing this phone , you didn 't buy it .
A consequence of that , between the other , was that the phone never break .
These days went .
We now have a variety of phones , especially in the cell phones , especially in the cell .
Here 's the cell phones of the future .
My favorite is in the middle , MP3 , cut of the nose , and the bunch of the bird , and the bunch for the crads .
If you don 't seen it in the negotis under the negotis , you 're going to be able to be .
And what happens is that people enters are in the store and ago , you know , you know , " Do you know , " No .
It 's not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn 't do too much .
So , in other aspects of life that are much more important than the buders , you verge the same explosion of choice .
Assistences : it doesn 't happen in the United States that you 're going to go to the doctor and the doctor , you have to do .
Instead , I walked out of the doctor , and doctor says , " Okay , we might do A , or " As these benefits and these risk " Why does you want to do ? "
You say , " Dr. What I should I do ? "
And the doctor says , " A has these benefits and these risks , and B has these benefits and these sought . "
What do you want to do ? "
And you 're saying , " Dr. " Dr. " Would you do that ? "
And the doctor : " But I 'm not she . "
The result , we call it " self-deal of the malate , expression that makes it seemed to make a great thing .
But , it 's not actually a moving the weight and responsibility to make decisions that you know , to someone who knows the doctor , to someone else knows anything -- and almost of course , it 's not in ideal condition to take it , which is not in ideal condition to take it .
There 's a huge marketing of drug products , direct to people like me and you , that if you think about it , it doesn 't make any sense , because we can 't buy them .
But if we can 't buy them , why do they public ?
The answer is that they want to do we call the doctor for ask to do it .
Something that fundamental as is our identity is a question of choice , as you see in this vignize , " We don 't want to force children . They will not give their children . They will be sex at the right moment , " We have to invent it . We have to invent it .
And we can reinvent how many times you do .
which means that every morning , at the morning , you have to decide that kind of person wants to be .
I respect to family and marriage , a time time , a time time , a common time , and it was that he was that married to us the most possible , and he was that she had the most soon to be able .
The only real choose was choose was with who , not when , and not even when you 're doing it .
And , it 's really to play .
I teach students very smart , and I have 20 percent of work , I 'm working on a time .
And not because they 're less bright , not because they 're less diligent .
Why do they have to be , you know , you know , " I should I get this ? I should be married or not ? I should I do it now ? "
" Would I be marrier later ? I have to think about the career ? "
They 're interrogorange interrogorange .
And they 're trying to answer these questions , even if this implessing not to do this implessing , and not get a beautiful vote to my examples of my examples .
And they have to do it . They are important questions .
Now , the work : we 're lucky , like Carl underground , because the technology allows us to work every day , every day , from every day , every day , from the Hotel Randolph .
On , there 's a corner , and I won 't tell you , where the WiFi , it 's not going to say , where the WiFi is works .
I don 't tell you , because I want to use it .
What does this incredible freedom of choice we have about work ? It 's that we have to do about work ? It 's we 've been going to work or not .
We can go to see our child play , and we can see our mobile phone in a pocket , Blackberry in the other , and the notea books .
And even if they 're all spent , every minute that we see our child , we 're also asking , " Do you say , " Do you answer this called ? "
" I have to say that ? I have to say this email ? "
And also , when the answer is no , " all this makes the experience of your child , very different from what would be in other conditions .
So , from any part of the look , little bit , big things , large materials and large materials and lives , life is a question of choices .
The world was this : Overs the world was this : there were some possibilities , but it was not a question of choice .
The world today looks like this : The world is a good thing , or negative ?
The answer is , the answer is .
We all sorts of the slide , so I 'm going to talk about the negative ones .
All this choice two effects of two negative effects of people .
The first , paradoxically , is that produces instead of liberation .
With the options of the options that choose , it 's very hard to do it .
I give you an example of a meaningful example : a conduct on flourishing plan of volunteer .
A colleague had access to the VanOur data , the gigantic funding society of funding , with about a million clients of employees in 2000 different companies .
What she discovered is that for every 10 solutions that are taking in more , the percentage of adesion , the percentage of two percent .
With 50 funding funding , there 's 10 percent in less than when they 're available to be about five percent of it . Why ?
Because with 50 funds that choose , is very hard to decide , and it 's very hard to decide , and choose to ask .
And to questions , and I still ask questions , questions , and of course , questions , and of course , and ask , of course , and ask , and of course , and ask , and of course , tomorrow , questions , and of course , questions , and of course , questions , and ask , of course , and ask , questions , and of course , and then of course , and ask
You know , it doesn 't only means that these workers are going to be eating food for dogs because they 're not going to have enough money , it means that the decision is to be so hostics that they lose the funds of the complementary of the work dator .
Not putting , they 're losing to five to 1,000 dollars for the worker , which would be very well to versary .
So , the paralysis a consequence of having too many choices .
And I think it makes the world .
" And finally , " ethernity : ketchup , or maionese ? "
You want to take the right decision , if it 's for the right , if it 's for ethernity , right ?
You don 't want to choose the bottom , and you don 't want to choose the wrong source .
So , this is the first thing . The second is that we also if we can avoid the paralysis and do a choice , at the end of how we would be able to be with less options of how we would have been with less options of how we would choose .
And this for several reasons .
One of these is that with many conditions of them , if you buy a lot of them , and it 's not perfect , it 's not perfect , it 's not perfect , you know , you would have been better . And what happens is better . And what happens is better . And what happens is that the alternative imagined us . And what happens is that the slip putting the satisfied decrease ,
And when it was a great decision .
The more choices , the easier is easy to be displeasure of any detail that 's insodds that 's insodhies .
There is , there is what economist-downtown .
Dan Gilbert asked very well as a value of value that we do things depends on what we 're depends on what we compare .
And the rest , when there are many options of the options that are easy to be able to represent the expensive features of the option of the option that is chosen .
Here 's an example . I school with all those who are not in New York York .
But that 's what you probably think .
There 's this bairs of Hamptons .
A place of lurther .
It 's becoming . It 's all for them . It 's all for them .
Not house . But what he thinks is , " Well , it 's a little bit . "
" Everybody my neighbors in Manhattan is on . "
" I could do it with very park at home . "
And it 's pass two weeks , from the idea that 's losing -- every day -- the possibility of parking , where it wants .
The constood decreases the satisfaction for what we have , even when choice was excellent .
And the more is the options we have to consider , the characterial characterial , they 're going to be reverse against the expensive constood .
Here 's another example .
This vignize a lot of things .
It 's about the moment , and maybe the living slowly .
But the most important point is , any thing you choose , you choose , you 're choose to do not .
The things that we don 't choose have many attractive attractive that can make less attractive what we do .
Third point : it 's growing the expectations of expectations .
I tried it on my skin buying a new couple of jeans .
I 'm almost always jeans .
And once the jeans were only one kind of , buy them and bought from besty , they were dissibestia , only after they took one life and washed a lot of times , they started to go well .
So , I went to buy a new when the old ones were gone , and I said , " I need a couple of jeans , this is my cut . "
The commit told me , " He wants to do easy fit , and he 's relaxy fit ? "
And he wants to do with the cernightons ? " Stonewashed , " " As " across " ? "
" Do you want to be strapped ? "
" Sots them wants or large , and a blue , blaw , " was elencare .
I was saying , and after a while I was able to say , " I want the guy -- that was the only kind of the kind of , " I didn 't have idea what it was , so for a time I tried to all jeans , and then came out of the best pitself , and then I came out of the best pair , I had ever had .
It was the massive . And I got the whole choose to get the best .
But I felt worse .
Why ? I wrote a book to understand this .
The reason I was worse about is that with all that choice , the mixture was very high , the jeans had to be perfect .
I was waiting for me . I didn 't expect anything excited when there was only a kind of exceptional thing when it was only a kind of a kind of thing , but when I saw 100 different , and they saw ,
What I bought was , but not perfect .
After we had to compared that choose with what I was trying to do with what I was trying to do .
The addition of options in the lives of people not doing that expectations that these have respect to the excellence of options .
And this will produce less satisfaction , even when the results are good .
Nobody in the marketing world .
Because if they knew it , you wouldn 't know what I 'm talking about .
The truth more like this .
" It was better when he was worse , " The reason you were better when he was worse , when you were worse , it was that when you were worse , it was worse yet possible to meet .
The worse , in the world we live in -- opulents , industrialized citizens with the expection of perfefeeding , the massive thing that we can hope is that things are at the height .
You 've never surprised surprised because your expectations , you 're ingiant , you 're ingiant .
The secret of happiness -- what you 're here -- is , " Basse " Shand , " Yes , " You want it . "
I mean , little moment moment moment -- which I 'm really married and my wife is really stupid .
I could not have done better , I didn 't have a better , I didn 't have a huge .
But , you know , it 's not always a good thing .
And finally , a consequence of the buy of jeans , when there 's only that you 're not seet , when you 're not satisfied , and you say , " Why ? "
" Who is responsible ? " The answer is clear .
The world is responsible . What could I do you do it ?
When there are hundreds of jeans , and you buy a lot of them , and you 're asking you , and ask who 's the responsible , it 's as a clear that responsible , it 's as a clear that responsible responsible ,
You would have been doing better .
With hundreds of available variety , there are not scale for the insuccess .
So when people are taking decisions , even if the result is , they feel in fact , they feel insoddish and give the colcolors the same .
In the last few years , the depression of depression is exploded in the industrialized world .
I think a significant factor -- not the only important , but the important thing -- of this depression of depression is just that people have deludent experiences because the standards are too high .
And when they have to explain this situation think that the became is they 're .
So the final result is that in general , we 're better , and we feel worse .
Let me remember .
This is the official dogma , what we all take for good and it 's completely fake . It 's not true .
There 's no doubt that a little bit better than having is not at all , but that doesn 't get at all , but it doesn 't have a lot of choice is better than a little bit .
There 's a critical value , magical value . I don 't know what it is .
But I 'm sure we 've been doing this , by a piece of the level where they do do our lives .
Now , from the political point -- I 've almost finished -- from the political point of view , the political nocity .
What allows you all this choice in industrial society is material .
There are many places in the world , and you know about it , where the problem is not they have too much choice .
The problem is they have too little bit of it .
So the face that I 'm talking about is a sick of modern , that 's a slide of modern , remember ,
And what does have to do is this : Steve Levitt talked about yesterday about how much those expensive and discovered seats for books are inured .
I mean , these choices , complicated and dispenous , it 's not just inured .
They 're even deleteries .
They make us worse .
If a little bit of what we in our societies , it 's going to be reversed in those where people have too few possibilities , it would not only be better to make their lives , better , but also .
This is what economists are called a pareted improvement .
A reduction of the refining refined , not only to the poor -- because of this choice , in a way that it comes back .
And to conclude , " You know , you can become everything that you want , "
You , people of culture , you 're thinking , " What does that fish ? "
" It 's obvious that you can 't make it in a glass of glass . "
" A castrated imagination , a limited view of the world --
And I 've interpreted it , I 've interpreted it at the beginning .
But then , think , instead , I realized that fish the knows that weight .
Because the reality of the fact that if you eat the bocle , so that , " all you can 't get the freedom . You get it through . You get the paralysis .
If you break the boat , so that everything you can decrease be decreasuitous soddisatisfaction .
You get the paralysis , and you can reduce it .
They need a sphere .
This is almost of course , too , maybe even for the fish , and perhaps for us .
But the absence of some symbolic symbolic sphere is a recipe for infections , and tem , for the roin .
Thank you .
