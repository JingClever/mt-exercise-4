The last year I showed these slides to demonstrate that the glacial glacial , which for almost three million years had the United States , the last last year , it 's refered 40 percent .
But this underundergravity , that is the gravity of the problem because it doesn 't show the thacross .
The Actuical calots is , in a sense , the heart of the global climate heart system .
It 's expanding winter and you reverted summer .
The next slide is going to be a quick carlying on the last 25 years .
The ice lost are signed in red .
You see , you expand , you expand up up up up up up to the blue .
That 's the ice in the winter , which is shake up .
You can see the cosidgn , along , five years or more , is like the blood , which is like the blood , which is like the blood , which is like the blood , which is like the blood , which is like the blood , which is like the blood , which is like the blood , which is like the blood , which is like the blood , which is like the blood , which is like the bloo
In 25 years , it 's the way , at this .
This is a problem because the warming of the ground glaciers around the ocean , where there are huge amount of coal bunch that , the huge amount of coal congeled that , they 're transformed into the meters .
I 'm going to spect the totality of atmospheric pollution , that amount of global warming , that amount of the world .
In some deep hand , in Alaska little holding hunting the metane is already bollating from water .
The professored Katey Walter University of Alaska of Alaska , I 've got a basis , with a team , very , very , very , I think ,
Video : Wow ! Howow ! You 're good .
A reason that this is that this termal exchange that Greenland from the north .
This is a glacial river .
The dowasn 't had ever reached levels .
This is the Kangerlussuaq , in the West Souast West Greenland .
If you want to know how you do the sea level of the sea level of the ice , here is where you reach the sea level here is where you reaches the sea level here is where to reach .
These corrings are increasing rapidly .
From the other hand : Antarctica , the largest block of the planet .
The last month last month , the scientists have gone that the ice of the ice of the ice is in negative , and that Antarctica , which is a few isoles on some islands , pogets on some bucky .
Exide six meters of the hand , like Greenland .
Himalayas , the third biggest block , you see new lay , which is new lay , which few years ago were glaciers .
Fort-percent of the world population would recurrent water from the melting water .
Sull Ande : this glacier is the source of the water source of this city .
The downstice .
But when it decrease , the same happens to the population .
In California the snow on the Sierra Nevada is 40 percent .
The crisis is in crisis .
Pejustly , as you read , they 're flex .
The growing powerful city in the world leads to a remarkable increase in the world .
The environmental disasters are increasing a rhythm out of the normal and without precedental and no precedental disaster .
Four times more numerous times in the last 30 years than 75 years than 75 .
This is a whole thing about insustainable .
If you look at it in the historical consequences .
In the last five years , we 've added 70 million tons of CO2 every 25 million tons in the ocean every day .
Look attentially the Eastern Pacific , the Americas , the Americas , the Americas , the Americas , the west , and on both the parts of the ocean .
The major causes global warming , together with deforestation , which is 20 percent of the fossil fuel use .
The oil is a problem , and the coal is even worse .
The United States is one of the two countries with China emissions , together at China .
And he was proposed to build many other central power .
But we 're seeing a change of direction .
These are the annoullated projects in the last years and some proposes of versus versus versus versions .
Every way , there 's a political fight in our country .
The coal industries and oil have spent 250 million dollars in the last year to promoting coal bucks , which is a clean oxymer .
I remember something --
I 'm going to Christmas , in the Christmas , there was a 3.8 billion glost of carbon dioxide .
Maybe you saw it on the news .
This is the biggest flow of scories in America .
It happened around Christmas .
The natalization of one of the carbon industries was this .
Video : â™« Frosty the carbon is a pleger and happy .
It 's abundant here in America , and it growing our economy .
Frosty carbon is more and more published .
It 's good price , adorable , and the workers maintain the stypend .
Al Gore : From here is a lot of the coal of the West Virginia .
The biggest mineral society is Massey Coal . This is his administrator .
Video : Don Blankenship : : I 'm going to be -- Al Gore , Nancy Pelosi , Harry Reid -- they don 't know what they 're talking about .
Al Gore : So the Alliance for the Proteition of Clima has launched two campaiged campaigned two campaign .
This is one of them , one part .
Video : Atter : Actually , we see climate change as a little bit of serious serious things like a threat to our business .
So our priority is investing a big amount of money in a effort to advertising , to make public and confused to make the truth and confused to the truth .
In fact , coal , is not sports of coal .
We think it 's cleaned -- it 's also a good profuel .
So not precooh of climate change .
Let 's do that .
Video : Carbone , you know , you know , you know , you 've heard a lot of this .
So let 's take a turn into a turn into a pattern on the clean , as much carbon published .
Straordinary ! The machines are a little noisy , but that 's the sound of the technology of coal public coal .
The coal consumption is between the major global warming , but the remarkable technology of coal warming , you see changes everything .
Let 's a look . This is the technology of the clean technology of the clean .
Al Gore : Finally , the positive alternative connects to economic economic security and to the national security .
Video : Comvest : The America is in the crisis ; the national security , the climate crisis .
The field that all of them : our dependence on fossil fuels , like coal coal and oil .
But , there 's a new , a new , cars , a new solution for it .
Repower : 100 percent of clean energy , in 10 years .
A plan to put America to work , make sure that 's work , and to stop global warming global warming .
Finally , a solution that you would stop solve our problems .
America . It 's more . Scoper .
Al Gore : This is the last .
Video : Comvest : That 's about rewards to America .
One of the fastest ways of taking the dependence on the degree that killing our planet .
What 's the future is here . Vinent , only a new energy network .
So what you do with two : Novi investment for the work of work .
Coming : Repower America . It 's time to be realistic .
Al Gore : A old African proverbial African says , " If you want to go fast , you go down to the wind .
If you want to go away , you go together . "
We have to go away , quickly .
Thank you very much .
Last year at TED did an introduction in the LHC .
And I promise to return to advance on how the machine works .
So here I am . And for the other time , there was no LHC , the LHC is the biggest scientific experiment ever trying -- 27 kilometers of circumstered .
His task is to remember the conditions that were less than a billion second , from the beginning of the universe -- to 600 million times a second .
That 's just a environtious .
This is the Ginevra under Ginevra .
We 're picking these mini-Bang inside the detectors .
This is what I work . It 's called ATLAS -- is a large of 22 meters .
This is a spectacular picture of ATLAS in building so you can see the proportions .
Ten September 10 September year we have acceso the machine for the first time .
And this picture was taken down by ATLAS .
It was causes of huge festimmense in the control room .
It 's a picture of the first particles that had done all the turn of the LHC , and you go into collision , and in collision , with a part of the LHC , and spreading particles into the record .
In other words , when we see that image 10 to September 10 to September , we figured out that the machine works , which is a great victory .
I don 't know if this was this to do exultent us more or this , when somebody went to Google and saw that the initial page was this .
That means we have a cultural impact beyond that scientific .
It was a week later , there was a problem with the machine , and I had to these dorn floors here -- these dored dorated dorn dored .
These files bring 13,000 ampers bring when the machine works at the power of the power .
Now , the technicians among you look at the kids and say , " That 's not true . I 'm too much too much . "
And they can do that because when they 're very cosidly becoming the superconducers .
So , at less 271 degrees , at a lower temperature at the side of space between the stars , these floor to the stars , these floor .
In one of the guntures of the most nails in the LHC , there was a fabrication of fabrication .
So the flowing flowing up slightly , and the 13,000 press suddenly , they met a electrical resistance .
This was the result .
Now , this is even more impressive if you think that these magnets more more than 20 tons , and that they moved about 30 centimeters .
They 're damaged about 50 magnetets .
We had to take them , what we did we have done .
We have them restined and adusted them .
Now they 're going back all back to their place .
I mean , I mean , the LHC is going to be again .
We 're going to accinate it , and we expect to get a little bit of data , or June , and continue so our adventure to find what the day day day day day ,
Now , of course , in a way , these accidents reacting the debate on the value of science and engineering in frontier . It 's easy to competition .
I think the fact that 's so difficult , the fact of going to go beyond the limitations , I think that 's value of things like LHC .
I want to conclude with words of a Inglaughter scientist , Humphrey Davy , which , I imagine , in defends of his puple experiments of his puple , Michael Faraday , said , " Nient is so dangerous for the human mind 's human mind . " as much as the human retural ritency as the ideas of science is definitive , which is not a very dangerous , which is that the triphes to be completely confident worse .
Thank you .
I want to start asking you to start asking you to start with kids .
As you get to reach them and take them , and take them and take them and move them , and you learn to think about problems and sent them , and you know , to think about problems and manipulating relationships .
The space is deeply connected to the way we understand most of the world around us .
So , as we use a computer inspired by our physical objects , with my consulting Patts , and my consulting Patts , and my collaborator Jeevan Kalanithi , I started asking up , I started asking to ask me , " And if we use a computer , instead of having the only cursh mouse , we can deal with the manes of the manes ,
and sistemle our lifiment ?
The question was so interesting that we decided to explore the answer , building the answer , building the Siftable .
In a words , a Sift-that is a computer interactive computer as a big burning .
In a words , a Sift-that is a computer interactive computer as a big burning .
You can see them , they can see them , they can see " in each other , the right movement and they have a screen and a radio pattern and a radio radio .
But most of course , I 'm physicists , like the morning , you can just move them .
The Siftable is a new ecosystem of tools to manipulate the digital information .
And as they become more physicists , consciously , the other , as well , as they become more physicists , consciously , as we can move , the other , how we move , how we move them , we can move exploring new and fun interaction .
I 'm going to start with some simple example .
This Siften is configurated to show video : if you including it in a direction , video is going like this , if you including on the other side back .
These interactive rats are conscious of others .
If I love them , they 're interested in what they 're around .
If they 're surrounded , they can be surrounded .
If they 're surrounded , they can be surrounded .
They have their movement and inclination .
We then realized that one of the interesting implications of the interaction was the power to use common data , for example , " to fall , " a color like it was a liquid .
In this case , we have three Siftable configurated as a bad vernice and I can use them to color to the color in that central , where they mix .
and I can use them to color in that central , where they mix .
If we can be too much , we can put a little bit .
There 's also a beautiful possibilities of learning , like languages , mathematics and games where people can try to do things quickly , and see the immediately , and see the outcome of it .
Now , I 'm now --
This is a Fibonaces that I do with a equations program .
Here we have a words of words that is half in Scarabean and Boggle .
Pratically , you get a letter to every Siftable , you get a letter , Pratically , you get a letter to case on every Siftable , and while you try to buy words him about how to do it words control him about a direction .
And then , after about 30 seconds , they get a new set of letters and new chance to try .
Thank you .
So here 's the kids came up with the Media Lab , I did it so that they tried them and I took a video video .
They were very much liked .
And one of the interesting things about this kind of application is that you don 't have to give people many education .
You 've got to say , " Comptions of the words , " and they know exactly what to do .
Here 's how other people who try it .
This is our own head younger , on the right there .
It actually wanted to impilate them .
They were only bring moronces , for him .
Now , this is a cartoon app .
We wanted to build a tool for languages . And we wanted to build a Felix .
It can insert new characters in the scene , solving the Siftable , they can get their associated .
It can insert new characters in the scene , solving the Siftable , they can get their associated .
So , it 's doing the sun .
Video : The Sun is surprising .
David Merrill : Now he brought a train the scene .
Video : The arange treator .
Bababb ! Yeah .
So I school by I school , and put them neighbors can interact the characters --
Video : Bau !
and by inventing your story .
Video : Hao !
DM : It 's a little story with the wind , and he can decide how he did it .
DM : It 's a little story with the wind , and he can decide how he did it .
Video : Voluncles .
DM : The last example I have time to show you is a tool , realized , to the way , to walk and execececk music .
is a tool , realized , to pay and execting music .
Siftable here , Siftable here like basically , basically and bacteria .
Every one of these has four different variations , and you can choose what to use .
You can also insert these sounds in a sequence to you as well as well as you can .
And they just change it 's just doing to touch a sound and a " sequence . "
These are effects that you can control from the way , like reverbs and the filter .
I mean , you know , a particular sound , and then including it .
And then there are the general effects as time and volume , which is applying the whole sequence .
Let 's look at how it works .
Video : DM : We 're going to start putting a base in two Siftable " sequence , we know , we know , add other base .
I put a bottom line .
Video : DM : Now , I add some percussions --
Video : DM : And I 'll put the battery , so I can control the effect from the live live .
Video : DM : I can quencountered the whole sequence of the entire sequence by one side or another .
Video : DM : And I 'll add the filter to the low to the flower to get more expression .
Video : DM : I can recombine the sequence .
So I don 't have to plan it first , but I can improvisate , make it longer or more short .
And now , finally , I can move the whole sequence with the left Siftable to the Siftable .
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is building new mo-machine machine and more like how our brain work .
And today , I had time to show you one of the results of this path , and also a few chance that we try to bring out of the lab .
The concept that I want to transmit is that 's coming up with this new generation of properties , which will bring information in our world in the way we want .
Thank you very much .
I don 't see the time to talk with all of you .
I 'm a writer .
I 'm writing books is my profession , but it 's more than that , obviously .
It 's also the love and the fascinating of my life .
And I don 't expect to change .
But , I said , something particular happened in my life and my career , who led me to recently recently , I brought the whole thing to realibrate with this work .
The particular thing is that I recently wrote this book , this biography called " Manogy , Prega , Ama , " which , diversity , fundamentally from my previous books , for some reason , and became a big sensationship , bestseller interational .
And the result is that everywhere I go now , people treating me as if I was convicted .
It 's about -- convicted , convicted , convicted .
They 're all worried and they say , " You don 't have fear of fear that you couldn 't do anymore than we do better ?
You don 't fear to continue writing for all life without being able to create a book that can important to someone ?
What about someone ? "
It 's rassure , you know .
But it could go worse , I remember that I remember more than 20 years ago , when I started to say people -- I was a teenager -- I was a written .
I meet the same thing that was based on the same pture .
And people said , " Don 't themes I couldn 't temes ?
Do you have no fear that humiliation of the rejection ?
You don 't fear that you 're going to do this for all life without any life without there and die on a down-hand-driven heart such a bunch of failure ? "
So , you know .
The answer -- the short answer all these questions is , " Yeah . "
Yes , I have afraid of all those things .
I always had fear .
And I also fear of many other things that people might not have .
As the high and other spaper .
But , how about the write the what I thought and wondering about what I thought , and I would say , "
Is it rational ?
It 's logical that anyone who has been walked by a job that they were born to do .
But what is that so particular in the creative impress to make nervous about health worth health .
As my father , for example , he was a chemical engineer and I don 't remember a only time in his 40 years of activity where he was asked if he had fear to be engineer ?
And it was never -- that block of the John , how is the engineer ?
It doesn 't work like this , you know ?
Obbburn , chemicals like group don 't certainly have in the centuries , ga-hand , the reputation of being handed maniver-pressive manivil .
We have a writers , we have enough this reputation , and not only creative writers , but creative reputation of being huge mentally .
And I don 't think about looking at the sad of the magnificent deaths of the magnificent creative minds , only in the 2th century , young people who are just giving their hand .
And the ones that are not suicipate data they look at being actually dissatives from their dgets .
Norman Mailer , before he died in the last interview said , " Every my book killed me a little bit more " an amazing standing " more " an extraordinary affermation about their life .
But we don 't beat the time , we feel that because we 've heard these things that we 've been doing all all over the way we completely interized and accepted the notion that creativity and suffering are in some way , and that art , at the end , will be during the angly-sharp .
And the question I want to take all this idea is : you 're agreed with this idea ?
It 's good , you know , because he also looks at a centimeter from a centimeter distance to me not good about this supposed .
I think it 's hate .
And I think it 's even dangerous and I don 't want to see it in the next century .
I think it 's better encourage our big creative minds to live .
And of course , I know that , in my case -- in my case , it would be very dangerous to start fire out at the end of the circumstances , most of the circumstances that I 'm in my career .
That 's what you 're looking at , I 'm pretty young , I 've got about 40 years .
I 've still got about four decades workers in me .
And it 's very likely that anything I 'm written about now is going to be judated by the world as the jobs that I went out after spending the world .
I 'm slaved , because we are all about friends here -- is likely to my greatest behind my beholds .
Oh , Gesus , who think .
You know this is the kind of thinking that leads a person to start behind a person to start behind herently in the morning and I don 't want to do that .
I would be going to continue to do this work that I love .
So , the question is , how do it becomes , how
And so it seems to me , after many reflections , which the way to work to write is to create a psychological cougical protectitively , OK ?
I have to find a security of security between me , which I 'm writing , and my natural anxiety on which I 'm going to be able to get the scround of how to do this last year , trying to find other societies to see if they could have some more ideas to have the best ideas and healthier ideas to have the best ideas and more healthier sane .
about how to help creative people manage to manage the emotional risks of creativity .
And that research took me to ancient Grecia and ancient Rome .
I 'm going to do it because it turns out to circle and then back .
In the ancient Grece and ancient Rome -- people didn 't seem to believe that creativity came from the men , OK ?
It was thought that creativity was this spirit of the bears are dealing and that came to men from one of some sources and unknown , for the distant and unknown , for reasons ,
The Greeks were called the creativity of the " demons " demons . "
Socr. Sadies , he believed to have a demon that else wisdom from away .
Romans were the same idea , but they called that kind of spirit without a genius .
which is great , because the Romans , they really didn 't think that a genius was someone who was particularly intelligent .
They think that a genius was this kind of entities that created entities that created living was literally in the walls of a study of a artist , a little bit like the elphenced Dobby , and that came out of the work of the artist and pting the outcome of that work .
It 's the distance of -- here 's the distance of which I talk about -- that 's the psychological courial courial that you protects you from the outcome of your work .
And everyone who was so that he works , right ?
So the antients were protected by certain things , like the narcissism , right ?
If your work was exceptional work , you could not take all the merit , all knew that you were helped by this genius .
If your failure work , it wasn 't all your colm , right ?
They all knew that was your genius to be a incapable .
And so people han conceive creativity in West for a long time .
And then Renaised the Renaised all changed , and nacked this big idea ; we put the human being at the center of the universe , over the universe , and no longer leaving space to the mitic creatures that they write by divinity .
This was the Rational principle of humanity and people began to think that creativity came up with their own ished ished ished .
And for the first time in history , I started to referiring this or that artist as a kind of a kind of a person , rather than a genius with a person .
And I have to tell you , I think it was a big mistake .
I think that you can someone , a simple person to believe , as a recipient as a recipient as a source , the source of all the divine divine , creative , unknowable and ethernicable responsibility to the psyches that human-human-human-.
It 's like to ask someone to injury the sun .
It makes up the ego and creates all these intuitive aspectable of these things about performance .
And I think it was this destroyed to the artists in the past 500 years .
And , if that 's true , and I think that 's the question becomes , and now ?
Can we do it different ?
Maybe back to a more ancient understanding of humans and mystery .
Or maybe not .
Maybe we can 't phone 500 years of rational thinking in a 18 minutes .
And there is probably people between the audience who would solete legitimate suspected notion of scientific notion of , you know , you know , they follow people to spend up with their projects .
I 'm probably not going to convince you all about this .
But the question I 'd like to take is -- why not ?
Why not think that way ?
Because it 's more sense of everything that I 've ever heard to explain the exasperformance impreveality of the process .
A process that , as anyone who has ever tried to do something -- so , basically , all of everybody here -- you know , you know , you don 't realize .
And in fact , it can sometimes sometimes seem to look like paranormal .
I did this meeting recently with the extraordinary poeteteteteteteteteteteter , which has been a poeter for all life and said he was a poettheteteter and said to me during the Virginia , working out in the camps , and he was hearing it , in the fields up in the fields , and he was the poem .
He said she was like a broader train of air .
And that was rotating to her from the landscape .
He felt it was going to be able to be able to get the ground under his feet .
He knew you had one thing to do at that point and it was , he words like , " run like a matta . "
And so he running up to home and he was going to get up with this poem , and he wouldn 't have to make something else and a fairly , and a cloud , and he would take it and slaughter , and he slaughter , and he would take it up on the page .
Sometimes he couldn 't be faster enough , so he goes and running and running her and running her rotles through and her rotles through and her rotles was going to go through the landscape , for her , looking for how she said , " another poet he said , " one more poet . "
And then there were those times -- this piece I will never forget -- there were some times where it was almost losing it , right ?
So , he was running house and he was looking for card and the poem was looking at the time , and he was going to a match in the way he was going , and then he said , " He was like he sleep with the other hand and and the coffering .
He was going to the poem from the tail and reput it in his body and turned it on the page .
And in these cases , the poem would be presented on the perfect page and intact on the last word at the first .
So when you hear it -- I think it 's crazy , it 's exactly equal to my creative process .
Not my creative process -- I 'm not a condition .
I 'm a mule , and my way of working is , is , and I wake up to the same horaries every day and play and take a step .
But even I , in my head , I 've stripped against that thing , at sometimes .
And I guess that also a lot of you the han done .
You know , even if the work and ideas were saying from a certain source , I could not honestly know .
And what is this thing ?
And how can we stand to it out of it so that we don 't do the head , but , rather , how do we stand ?
As I think about , the best example , I have a Tom Waits , which I have a Tom Waits , which I interviewed a different newspaper .
We were talking about this , and you know , Tom , for most of life was the incarnation of the artict of the articulated performance , trying to control , to manage , dominate these species of totally interized creative impulses .
But then I invest , he got up , and one day as he was driving on a driving autostroths in Los Angeles , he changed all for him .
He was going to fast and all and all of a sent training this little piody of melody , which comes into the inspiration , elusive and fixing , and the desiderate , and the desiderate , but not knows how to take it .
It doesn 't have a piece of paper , he has no matine register .
So he starts to hear this kind of old old anxiety is growing in him like , " I 'm going to lose , and I 'm going to lose this song .
I 'm not enough and I can 't do it . "
And instead of going to go into the panic , they stop .
And he did something completely new .
And he just look at the sky and said , " Are you see , don 't you see that I 'm driving ? "
" You know , " Would you write a song now ?
If you really want to be back , back at a more opporting time when I can take care of you .
Otherwise , you walk to something more than one today .
You go to disturban Leonard Cohen . "
And his work process changed after that .
I don 't work , the job was still like .
But the process , and the fish that was reef was releft when the genius was taken , the genius outside him , the genius outside him that I was doing it back where they were , and he remained it from , he was not to be an interized , and the genius .
but they were also , I think , wonderful bizarre collaboration between Tom and this strange thing in Tom and this strange thing and external thing that was not Tom .
So , as I felt that history started changing a little bit , and I was working on and I was saved and I had a time .
This idea , I was writing , when I was writing " Manogy , " Ama , " and the cadds in one of those cave disperation where we all cut on something and we can 't start thinking that it and we can 't start thinking that it 's going to be the worst , which is the worst ever written .
Not just the bad , right , just the worst book .
And I started thinking about guns this project .
But then I remembered Tom that was talking to air and tried to us .
So I got my face on the face and I got my commments to a vacuum and I got a vacuum of the room .
And I said it high voices , " You know , what we know that if this brilliant book isn 't be interacted , right ?
Because as I see that I 'm putting with that .
So if you want it to be better , you have to introduce and make your part .
OK . But if you don 't do it , I don 't do anything .
I 'll just writing the same because it 's my job .
And I 'd like to make my own part of the world today , I 've been presented to do my part . " Because at the end is so , OK -- secovers ago in North Sholding damances to the clear of the clear of the clear of the dances of the cland-dances and music .
And they were always magnificent , because the dancers were professional and they were wonderful .
But every once , rarely , something happened , and one of these artists became was actually transcendent .
And I know what I 'm talking about , because I know you all have seen , at a point , a performance like .
It was like the time stopped , and the dance dancing dance through a kind of walked through a kind of walking , and he didn 't have any different from the usually , but it was fallineed .
And suddenly , it doesn 't appear like a human .
But you accen from the direction and below the fire in fire divinity .
And when this was happening , at the time , people knew what they were called it with his name .
They would conglames and they began to cantar , " Allah , Allah , God , God . "
That 's God , you know .
Curious known -- when the Morents , the South South , I was this habitude with them and pronounced her and pronounders changed in the centuries from " Allah , " in " Allah , " the run , " which you can hear in the round or the floor in the floor .
In Spain , when a artist has done something impossible and magic , " Allah , the role , magnificent , magnificent , I would say , " British , " I 'm a scorce of God .
And it 's great because we need it .
But , the problem is goes the day after the dancing dancing , and you wake up and discover that they 're the 11 in the morning of Martedyes and God 's downests .
It 's just a bad with bad gran ballows , and maybe it 's not going to ever height .
And maybe no one will be the name of God still as yet , and what is it needs to do with his life ?
It 's hard .
This is one of the most painful reconcilifestion to make life .
But maybe , you don 't have to be so angoal for being so angotic if you can 't believe , intural , the most extraordinary aspects of your being being coming from yourself .
But you just believe that they 're going to pay at a very inimaginable source of this squisite of your life that you have to someone else 's going to someone else else when you finished .
And , you know , if we think about this is all changes .
And so I started thinking about it , and it 's certainly like I thought for a different months in the works that I 'm going to public soon , I 'm going to do soon , I 'm going to be followed by the way of my grandscape .
And what I have to continue to tell me when I feel elected by this is , not going to be able to be .
Don 't go .
Continua presenter , you know , any one one of them can be .
If your work is dancing , bought .
If the divine , you know , I walked up to you decide to let me go up with some kind of wonder , for one moment through your effort , then , " The ! "
You do the same thing , you do the same dance .
And " Ole ! " to you the same .
I think that I think , you know that I have to teach it .
" Your " to yourself , just to do the same , for you know , for them to make you continue to introduce you continue to make you continue .
Thank you .
Thank you .
June Cohen : Ole !
As I talked about some of these projects on the human genome , what can mean and the discovered of new genes .
Now we 're starting a new path : we started to digitalize biology and now from that digital code we 're going to a new phase of biology , design and properly providing life .
We 've always tried to get big questions .
" What is life ? " is something that many biologists I think have tried to figure out out of a lifts .
We tried different approaches , reduced it up to the minimals .
We 're digitalized by almost 20 years .
When we sequenced the human genome was to go from the analogical world of biology in the digital world of the computer .
Now we ask ourselves : can we regenerate life , or making new life from this digital universe ?
This is the map of a little organism , the Mycoplasma genitalium , which is the species from the smallest genome who can autoreum in the lab .
And we tried to reduce the genome of the genome to create one even smaller .
We can eliminate a hundred genes of the genes of the way of the 500 genes that I 'm here .
But when we look at his metabolic map , it 's relatively simple than our .
I think that 's simple .
But when we look at all the genes that we can eliminate , one at a time , is very improbable that this can bring to a living cell .
So we decided that the only way to progrew was synthesize this chromosome that we could have modify components to get the components to get some of these fundamental questions .
And so we started the adventure of " We can synthetize a cromosome ? "
Can you have the chemistry connection to produce these big molecules that we never have to create before we could now ?
And , in case , we can make a cromosome , we can make a cromosome ?
A cromosome is simply a chemical material inert .
The speed that we can digitalize the life is growing exponential .
Our ability to write the genetic code , rather progrece rather sently , but it 's improving .
And our most recent results of our exponential curve .
We started over 15 years ago .
The process required a lot of pass , starting with bioetics , beginning with bioetics before we began .
But we found that that synthesize DNA is very hard .
There are tens of thousands of machines in DNA , the world 's longer segments , the longer segment is a 50 letters and is a degenerative process : the longer segment is longer , the most errors .
So we had to develop a new method to assembly these broils and correct the errors .
And this was our first attempt , starting to start digital information from the Phi genome of Phi X 174 .
It 's a little virus that kills kills .
We designed the fragments , actually made the correction of errors and get a DNA molecule of about 5,000 letters .
The interesting part is when we took this chemical material chemical material inert , and we put it in the bacteria , bacteria have started reading this genetic code and produced the viral particles .
The viral particles have been releft from the cells , they 're back and destroke the E. coli .
I 've talked about recently with membrles of the oil industry , which they have certainly compressed .
They 've gone over you .
We believe this is a situation where the software can actually make his hardware in a biological system .
But we wanted to do things to do the bigger .
We wanted to build the whole cromosome of the bacterium .
They 're over 580 miles letters of genetic code .
So we thought I 'd build it in cassettes of the viruses , so that we can change the cassets out of the cassets to figure out what the components of a living cell .
The design is crucial , and if we start with digital information in a computer , these have to be very accurate .
When we sequenced this genome for the first time in 1995 , the standard accuratity was a mile for every 10 miles .
We found , recognentire it , 30 errors . If we used that original sequence of that original sequence , we would never be able to work .
One part of the process is designing 50 letters that they overlap segments that they have to have a 50 letters to build subunit smaller than 50 letters to build subunit smaller work together .
We 're going to give unique to the only thing here .
You probably have a bed thing that we put on the physical pleasant .
So , think it 's like this : we have a genetic code based on four letters : A , Gs and T.
Three of those readers put together code about 20 amminoacids , and there 's a specific order to each amount of letters to each amminoacids .
So we can use the genetic code to write words , frankers , thoughts , thoughts .
What we did was autogograped to do is autogographs to do .
Some have been delivered by the fact that it wasn 't poetry .
We designed these segments to just to join them .
There are enzymes that repair them and put them up .
And we started assembly assembly with the parts , starting with five to segments from five to seven miles letters , and they can make a segments of 24 miles letters .
So we have these sequence in abundance , so we produced these sources in the step that we 're trying to create a extremely robustood -- you 'll see in a minute .
We 're trying to automatize the process .
So , this looks like the tabellon a basket playoff .
When we get to these very long segments , more than 100 miles , the more than 100 miles , they 're not going to grow more directly in the E. coli .
You get to the limit of the modern tools of molecular biology .
So we 've been considered with other mechanisms .
We knew about another mechanism called recombination , which in biology , which is in biology to repair the DNA can join the segments .
Here 's an example .
This organism , called Deinococcus radiodurans , it can absorb three million ray .
You can see in the superior as his chromosome like his chromosome .
In 12 -- 24 hours , it 's going to be like before .
There 's thousands of organisms that are able to do that .
These organisms can be completely .
They can live under a vacuum .
They 're absolutely certain that life exist in space , and you move to find new environments of water .
In fact , NASA showed that this is .
This is a picture of the molecule that we 've built these processes , just using the least design appropriately to insert .
The yeast assemble them authically .
This image was not taken with a microscope , but with a regular microscope , but with a regular microscope .
It 's a very big molecule that we can see it with a launch microscope .
These are pictures that cover a time of about six seconds .
This is the publishing we 've done a little time ago .
It 's more than 580,000 letters of genetic code .
It 's the largest molecule of a defined structure of the man ever created structure .
It has a weight molecular weight to 300 million .
If we stamp it with a 10 without spaces , you would like 142 pages , it 's just going to transport this genetic code .
Now , how do we do that ? How can we take it ?
Obviously , you have a virus is a game .
It 's a little bit more complicated when they use bacteria .
It 's also simpler when it 's eucarios like our : you can just extract the nucleus and put another , which is basically the clonation process .
In the bacterium archaean is instead of integrated inside the cell , but we have recently demonstrated that we can do a beautiful cromosome from one bank cell to another and activity it .
We could have a cromosome with microbial species .
The two are different men are how humans from the men .
We 've added some gene way that we can decide what choose to choose for this cromosome .
And then the skiloss with the hills , and he killing all the protein .
And when we put it in the cell was study -- and you 're appreciate our sophisticatoes -- the new cell cell cell .
And we actually thought we couldn 't go beyond , but we 've tried anyway more in there .
This is one of the major mechanisms of evolution .
We found that a lot of added species have added a second or a third chromosome of , adding in a thousands of new tracts of the species .
So who think evolution is just a gene at the time that you can 't have a lot of biology .
There 's a true of restriition called " restriition that they are digested by the DNA .
The cromosome that was in the cells , you know ,
The cell phone that we put it up .
It 's expressed , and he recognized the other chromosome as expressed material , and we got it with only the cell and the new cromosome .
it became blue because of the genes that we have put .
And in a short time , all the characteristics of a species have gone , and they turned around a new species , based on the new species , based on the new software that we put in the cell .
All proteins have changed , membranes have changed , and when we read the genetic code exactly what we 've been transferred to what we 've been transferred to what we 've been transferred to what we 've been transferred to what we 've been transfer .
Now , this could seem alchemy genetic software , but we can see the software DNA , we can change things in a kind of substantial .
Now , I 've already explained that you don 't talk about genesis -- but we 've been progress from three and a half million years of evolution , and I said that maybe we 're going to create a new version of Cambrian explosion of the Cambrian explosion of the Cambrian explosion .
Why do that ?
I think it 's obvious when we think about our necessities .
We 're going to go from six and a half billion people at nine billion in the next 40 years .
Right to give an example : I was born in 1946 .
Now there are three people on the planet for each existing in 1946 ; there 's four .
We 're having problems now to find food , fresh water and clean , medicinal gas and a half billion people .
It 's going to be more harder for nine billion .
We use more than five billion carbon , more than 30 billion bets , more than 30 billion oil bets .
That means percent million baries a day .
When we try to find biological processes , or any kind of process to reduce them , it 's going to be a huge challenge .
We have to hold the whole emission of CO2 from these materials that end up in the atmosphere .
At day , because of the scientific discoveries all around the world , we have a database with about 20 million genes , and I like to think that they 're designed for the future .
The electronics the electronics only has a dozen about a dozen of components , and think of how many different things came out .
Our limitations here are very biological data and our imagination .
Now we have the techniques , because of these rapids of synthesization , we can create what we call the combatory genomics combatory .
We can build a big robots that can produce a big robots that can produce a million cromosomes a day .
Think of the processing these 20 million genes or to try to get the processes to produce either the processes , new vaccine , new vaccines , new vaccine , and we can change , because of a small team , and create more biology now that in the last 20 years of science .
And it 's just a standard selection .
We can choose for a chance of survival , chemical production or chemical or fuel , production of vaccine ,
This is an instantaneous instantly some programmed software programmed to be able to seat and design species to the computer .
Well , we don 't necessarily know how they will be .
We know exactly what they are genetic code .
Now we 're focusing on quarters of the generation .
You also have seen you that experiment from the grant was a finite finished experiment .
We have fuels and third generation that will be soon by the sugar , bigger than not worth of high value as the opt-value kinds of butanol .
But the only way biology can have a big impact of having a big impact without increase that the cost of food and limitarms that will be able to transform CO2 in matter , so we 're working on for design cells that we 're working on for design cells that can reach this discover , and we think we can have the first carbon as much generation in about 18 months .
The solar light with the CO2 is a metodo-odos -- but in our discoveries all around the world , we found different metods .
This is an organism that we described in 1996 .
It lives in the ocean , about 2500 meters deep deep the temperature of the water temperature .
They record the CO2 , using hydrogen molecular as the source of energy .
We 're trying to figure out if we can meaning CO2 , which can easily be transported by the tubes , convert that CO2 in order to drive this process .
So , we think we might be able to increase what we can increase what the basic question is , " which is Nice , versus -- we have the basic modity -- we have the goal of reduction .
Exactly . If you can 't do that from TED , where you can ?
It would become a main source of energy .
And also , we 're working on the same way , we 're working on the same metods to create instantaneous vaccine .
You 've seen this year with influence , we 're always back a year , and with a dollar under when it 's a buck is about to find the fair .
I think that you can change building vaccine combinable vaccinable vaccinable .
That 's how the future could start seem to look at change , now , the tree of evolution , accelerating the evolution with synthetic bacteria , arches , and finally celluus , and finally celluus , and finally celluus .
We 're so much from the best people .
Our purpose is to do a long enough to try to do it . Thank you very much .
First of all I 'll show you , the most quickly possible , some fundamental work , a new technology that we 've taken to Microsoft , in the next year ago exactly . This is Seadragon .
That 's a environment where you can interact is at the local level that you can interact with a huge amount of data .
Here we 're seeing a lot of digital gabyte of digital gabyte with a kind of glacking photos , disponing the images as we want .
And it doesn 't matter how big the amount of information that we see , how big these are gathering of data or images or the images .
Most of the most of the digital photographs , but this is a provent scanning from the Bioooo of Congress , and reentered in the gapixel .
It doesn 't make any difference because the only thing that the prestations of a system like this is the number of pixel on your screen in any time . It 's also a very flexible architecture .
This is a whole book , example , not a book of data .
This is the Dickens . Every colonna represents a chapter .
To show you that it 's about text and not images , we can do something like that , to actually show you that it 's a real representation of the text , not a picture .
It could be a little artificial way to read a book .
I don 't have to recognize that .
This is a more realistic example . This is a little bit of The Guardian .
Every big picture is the beginning of a section .
And it really gives you the pleasure and the beautiful experience of reading version of a bunch or a neighborhoods , which is a medium of a middle of middle .
We 've also done something with the corner of this particular number of The Guardian .
We created a higher advertising -- much more high than what you use in a normal publishing -- and we put you in a normal published -- and we put you in the extra .
If you want to see the characteristics of this automobile , you can see them here .
Or other other models , or even the techniques .
And this really demonstrates some of these ideas to eliminate the limitations of space on the screen .
I hope that means to put it finally up to the pop-up and other porcheries like , not to be necessary .
Of course , the map is one of the most obvious applications for this kind of technology .
And on this is not going to lose time , if not to say that we have contributes to also give up this field .
These are all the streets in the United States .
So now we 're going to something else .
This is now actually live on the Web ; you can go to the Web .
This is a project called Photosynth , which combine two different technologies .
One is Seadragon and the other is a visual research as a very interesting computer in Noah Snavely , a student of the University of Washington , with the Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Seitz , the UW 's a . A collaboration .
And it 's from the Web , they gested by Seadragon .
You can see that when we do this pattern , where we can go from one image to another and have this image and have this kind of experience in the other and have this kind of multiple resolution .
But the space collocation here actually has a meaning .
So , the visualization algorithms of the computer have recorded these images , so that corresponding to the real place in real place that the images -- all of them would be -- you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you see elements of a slide-stable show -- they 're going to a slide-stable show things have a stable or space .
I don 't know if I have time to show you some other environment .
There are some more space space .
I want to go directly to one of the original data set of Noahs -- and this is from a previous prototype of Photosynth that we 've done in the first scortedly , to show you what I think is the key behind this technology , the Photosymptosynth . And it 's not necessarily obviously obviously obviously look at the environments we put in the website .
We had to worry about the legal aspects and so on .
This is a reconstruction of the catthedral Dame of the Dame images from Flickr . Basta digitar . You can type Notre Dame in Flickr and you get images of the shirt , other campus and you get images . Eighball of these arancions , which is discovered to this model .
So they 're all taken pictures taken from Flickr , and they were all connected to the space level like this .
And it 's possible to navigate this way simple .
You know , I never thought I would never have thought I 'm working for Microsoft .
It 's very gratifically to receive this kind of holds here .
I think you can see that it 's a lot of different types of square of different field of those SLR phones : from those SLR , a significant number , makes meaning together in this environment .
And if I can , I try to try to look for those strange .
Many of them are faces , etc .
Somewhere there is a series of photographs -- here it 's a series of photographs .
This is a Notre poster Dame . registered correctly .
We can go from poster to the vision of this environment .
The essential point is that we can do things with social environment . This is now taking data from supply -- from the collective memory of how we look like the Earth , from visual visual -- and connects all those data together .
All those pictures become linated , more than the som of the parts .
You have a model of the entire emerges .
Think about this as a Stephen Lawler 's work of Stephen Lawler on Earth .
It 's something that grows in complexity as that people do it , and the advantages for people to use it ,
Their pictures are marking with put out and put out of other people .
If someone 's the idea of the idea of the craft of those days , the name of Notre catthedral Dame suddenly , you know , you know , you can use it as a kind of the data , and I can use it in the space of all these data , and I can use it in the space , in that metaphs of anyone else , and have a social experience of cross-mobile cross-mode experience .
Of course , a consequence of this is virtual models are virtual models of every interesting part of the Earth , and you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , but from the collective memory .
Thank you very much .
CA : I understand ? What 's what your software is going to us to do is that a little bit of the software is that in the next few years , all the shared photographs from anyone in the world will be basically connected with anyone who 's going to be basically connected with ?
BAA : Yes . What he 's doing is basically discover .
It 's creating hyperlink , if you want , among images .
And he 's doing it in the basis on the content of the images .
The thing becomes very interesting if you think about the richness of semantic information that 's recural information that 's required .
As you make a picture of images on the Web , you 're types , and the text on the web page has a lot of information about the images .
Now , what if that pictures is connected to all your pictures ?
So the amount of semantic interconnection and the amount of wealth that is really huge . It 's a very huge classic effect of the network .
CA : Blaise , it 's really amazing .
BAA : I thank you very much .
One of the major pleass when you travel and one of the deliverivers of the research that you have not forget the anti-forgod-bits anti-forgotten traditions , the wind in the wind stones , driver in the stones , driver the plants .
Basti thinking that shamans are travel even beyond the Via Lattea , or who are Inuit 's still a model of the Inuit is still colors that are meanings , the buddiers still are followed the reserve of Dharma , to remember the importance of the Dharma , to remember the major the idea that the world that we live in no sense , but it 's just a model of reality ,
the consequence of a particular set of choices that our own own own own own own own own own own bad , many generations ago .
And , of course , we all share of the essential trats .
We all come . We all procreate .
We are actually subjects of initiation .
We need to death the inesorability of death , so we don 't surprising and we 're going to take and drink --
We all have art .
What hits is the pursuit is the phone rhythm of the dance of every culture .
Not matter that they 're the Penan 's forests of the Borneo , or the following Vooodoo , or the warrior Kaisut 's warrior the desert Kaisut , or a cameras in the Curero of the Ande , or a cameras in the heart of the Sahara .
He was my journey companion in the desert a month ago , or a yaks , or a yaks , the deality of the world 's Everest , the right mother of the world .
All of these populations teach us that there are other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , other ways of the ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , other ways of the world 's modes of thinking , other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , other ways of the world 's ways to think , other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , other ways of exist ways of exists , and there are all of exists , and there are all these people are ways of exists of thinking , and there are all the world 's ways of
And , if you think , you know , it 's a concept that can give you hope .
Insit together , the world 's cultures of the world creating a spiritual life and cultural life that has been cultural life and cultural life that is important for the planet as biological rhy-known as biological rhy-known life as a beautiful note .
And you can think about this ragela cultural as a etnosphere and you can define ethnosphere , the total ethnosphere , mites , teached , moving inspiration , inspiration , bits intuitions , the wind touts to be .
The etnosphere is the patriage of humanity .
It 's the symbol of what we are and what we can be as a species .
And because the biosphere was very much consumed as well as it happened to the ethnosphere and purpose much .
No biologist , for example , it would say that 50 percent of all species has been or the hort of the simply simply extinction because it 's falready -- in the pocalyptimistic diversity -- and they don 't even even as close to the most optimistic diversity -- and they don 't even even even even even even the most optimistic diversity --
The index of all this is , obviously , the linguistic loss .
When you were born 6,000 languages on this planet .
A language is not only composed by a grammal vocabulary or a series of rules .
A language is the miracle of the human spirit .
It 's the middle of which the animal is coming in the material world .
Every language is a forest of the mind , a water water water , a spiritual chance .
And of those 6,000 languages , as we 're here sitting in Monterey , at least half , not the half of the kids .
They don 't get more teached to kids , which means , unless you wouldn 't walk something , which is already death .
What is more sad sad than being the silent , the last to be the last talk to a language , the last one , the way that 's not how to transmit the wisdom of the promises , you know , you know , you know , the last few children ?
This is a flowing that was someone in the world every two weeks : every two weeks , one 's a high school 's moving and door with the tomble , the so-pounds of the last syllables of a ancient language .
And I know somebody who 's going to say , " Isn 't that ?
The world wouldn 't be a better place if we talk all the same language ? " Well , we all talk about yorba . We talk cantonese . It 's about the cantonese .
Let 's talk about koges .
You 'll get a little bit of a translation .
I 'd like to do a journey through ethnosphere --
a little journey in etnosphere to give you a little bit of what we 're losing .
Many of us forget that when I say , " different ways of exists , " I mean , " I mean , " I mean , " I mean , "
So , let 's take for example , Barasana books , in Amazon , the popular anaconda , which creatures the myth of the snake , which creats the myth of the snails in the snap sants .
It 's a popular that doesn 't have the blue to distinguish the blue of green because the cell is identified in the time of the forest , which depends the popular .
They have a strange language and a matrimonished rule , " linguistic language : : you have to mark a person who talks to different language .
And it all radical in the past , though the partnership , the partnership of these families that they talk about six or seven linguages that they 're talking about six or seven languages anyone practice .
They 're limited to listening and then they start talking .
We take one of the most interesting tribes that I lived , the Waorani Waorani Eastern Ecuador , a popular amazing popular that had the first contacts in 1958 .
In 1957 , five missionaries have tried to commit a factor .
They did not have taken up photographed them that they had a few adished adijumped , forest that this popular popular pluvial forest .
They 've gone the pictures of the ground , they turned them into the research or a figure and , not finding nothing , they have concluded that they were dealing with the district , and they killed the five though of their light-missionaries with the mill , and they killed the five though .
But the Waorani wasn 't just killed foreign .
They killed to kill them .
54 percent of the mortality was caused by the same .
We 've been running at eight generations and found two of natural death and when we indeed to know , they admit to know , they admit for them , and then they were killed to be able to be old , and then they kill it the same .
The clappers were able to recognize the animal hurine for 40 steps and recognize the species .
In the early ' 80s , I had been assigned a very interesting task when I was Harvard asked me if I wanted to go to Haiti Haiti to intrufollowing me to Haiti me to be the base in the base of Duvalier and the Tonton Macoutes , and impossessed me to make zombigger zombies .
To make sense of miraculous miraculous , I would have to understand the Vodoun culture and that Vodouth is not magic .
It 's pretty much of a complex metaphysical vision of the world .
Very interesting .
If I asked you to tell me the big religions of the world , what would you say ?
Christianity , Islam , Budddism , etc .
A continent is always left out , thinking that the sub-Saharan Africa has not religious feeding . And instead of these religious concepts of these religious concepts of these religious concepts of these very profound concepts of these religious concepts in slavery in the slavery .
What 's interesting is the intense relationship between life and death .
So , you know , you know , the way , you know ,
They can be invited by the Great Acqua , and they would reach the dance of dance and replace temporary to the soul of the vive and they replace temporary to the fact that for a brilliant to be the following goes .
So , the voodooists love to say , " You know , white you go to churk God .
We say in the temple and forget God . "
And from the moment that you 're going to be , is the spirit that you guide , how can you do the evil ?
So you 're looking at these incredible events : followers in the state of trance that touch impunts , infuel snaked a demonstration rather strong demonstration when it 's catalyed in a state of the mind , when it 's catalyzed in a state of extreme extreme .
In all the popular populers which I lived the most amazing are the Kogi of the Sierra Nevada de Sierra Nevada Marta , in Colombia section .
Except of the ancient civilization that once living on the planning of Colombia in the waiting , the popular popular mainly report , the popular plan 's planning .
In a blood continent , this popular continent , this popular never been conquered by the spages .
And so , they 're now now , from a clero , but their formation is really extraordinary amazing .
The young people followed out of the families to three or four years , and they live secregated in a world that good shadow and hundred hold hundred years .
Two periods of nine years , I 'm going to reproduce the nine months of gestation , which is now now they 're metaphically in the mother of the Great Mother .
For all of the time , they get acculturated to their society values , values that they predict and their prayers maintain the cost of their own maintain maintain maintain the cost ecological balance .
At term of this incredible initiation , they 're suddenly taken out and for the first time in their life , at the age of 18 , they see a high . And in that moment of consciousness , the only one bad burst of the first wrong , when the sun is wrong valley , the beautiful landscape , all the theory of the patterns , they have learned is that they confirms .
" Vison ? I 'm going to do how I said .
It 's amazing . Now is you protect it .
They 're called the bigger brothers and say that we , brothers , are the colors of the destruction of the world .
This is a level of intuition is extremely important .
When we think about the indeed populations and the environment , we 're the Resau and the old story of the noble selection , which is a razy razy concept in his simplicity or perhaps we say that these populations are closer to the Earth of us .
The Indigenes are not neither nor indebate from nostalogy .
There 's no space for these things in the malaria of the Aststoppalues or in the Celids , but because of the time and the ritues , they created a mystical mystical of the Earth 's based on the concept of being known , but on a burn , neighbors , but the concept that the Earth can only live because it 's infected by human consciousness .
What does it mean ?
That 's a kid of the Ande that a boy of the Ande that mountain is a Apu who is driven his destiny is a human beings . And it 's going to be a very different relationship , and will be a very different relationship with the mountain or that place is a very different rocks .
That 's the dimora of a mineral or a mineral crawling is irrivous .
What 's interesting is the metaphor that defines the report of the natural world .
I grew up in the forests of the Britannica credding that the forests service to be cut .
That made me a different human being from my friends Kwakiutl who believe that the forests are Hukukuk 's dimora of Hukuk and the beautiful stories of the paradise and the downballowing the world , spirits that they 're starting to last last north of the world , spirits that they 're starting at the beginning .
If you start to look at that these cultures can create different reality , you can start to understand some of their discoveries . We take this plant sensational discoveries .
I took this picture to open the Nororororthern Amazon .
Maybe some of you have heard of the ayahuasca , the most powerful pance of the sciamanic repertoilet 's play .
What makes the playahuashuashuasks is not the physician , but his elements . It 's covered by two elements .
From a hand , this leaving leaks a series of Ta-cooolin , harmine and harmine , slightly hologists .
You can only get the plant , you have a blueprint that I high a little bit of consciousness , but it 's misceled with the leaves of a coffee of the Psychotria .
This is triptamine ples , very similar to serotonin , methoxyltryltryltryltryltrystered .
If you ever see Yanomami , if you ever see Yanomami , they make a different set of species , anchly exactly methoxyltrystered .
And so , you know , the bigger is a little bit like being disappeared by a bunch of batch and landing on a sea of electricity . You know , you know , you know , it 's the dissolution of reality .
I went down with my professor , Richard Evan Shultes , the man who took the psychedelic was psychedelic , with his discovered of the fungi in the ' 30 in Mexico .
I mean , my thesis , you can 't get these triployed tripsters like hallucinogens because if you 're not telling any of being hallucinated .
You can just take them up , if you 're just to give them up with other chemicals that denaturate MAO .
Now is the beautiful : the dramatically : carboline that are in this liana of MAO , the same kind of the same kind of potential that we need to trip-to-like fan 80,000 species of plants , like these popular popular popular sources , like these popular popular version of the parts , but if you combine in this way , create a biochemical version that is sometimes the somultiple of parts ?
We use the great eulife-herror ejuggle , which can be infruttifer .
But if we ask the Indians , they 'll tell us , " The plants are talking about it . "
What does it mean ?
This tribes , the Cofan , the Counfan , and it 's 17 variety of the game , which is that they would be able to the same species .
If we ask them how they are they going to make their tasonomy , they 'll tell us , " I think I would not ? " I said , " No .
The solution is : they take the 17 variety in a night of a bunch of a skirts and each night is going to a different .
With this doesn 't have lead to Harvard , but it 's much more interesting than to contt sts stand .
Now , the problem is that even the ones of us who have heart the people who have heart populers are paintings , but somehow reduced in the real world , and pass to the margins of history of our real world , and pass beyond .
In fact , the 20th century , between 300 years , it 's not reminded for his wars or his innovations , but rather like the era that we stopped and we stopped activity , and we have activally or accepted the destruction of the biological diversity of the planet . Now is not the change .
All cultures through the centuries have been involved in a dance for new chance of life .
And the problem is not technology .
Indians Sioux didn 't stop being Sioux when they put out and they put out so much like Americans have no stopped to be Americans when they put out Americans and calated .
It 's not the change or technology that integrity integrity . It 's not the power .
The hard fly of the domination .
And if you look at the world , you 'll find that these are not destined cultures .
They 're living creatures and dynamics pushed identifable forces that come beyond their ability to adaptation .
Boy that 's disboscaring in the Penan Patria --
a popular nomake Sarak , in the Souast Asian , a popular popular who lived in the forest to a generation , and now reduced to the servitch and prostitution on the reduct reduced by the rivers , where you can see the river the river river from the flowing . Borneighborhoods , where the naveled Meridian Cinese , where the navels the orizonesesday ,
taking the stage of the wood I dream with the forest dream .
Or in the case of Yanomami , are the disease that have come with the discovered of the gold .
If we move on the mountains of the Tibet , where I 'm doing many research you , you 'll see the hard of political domination .
As you know the genocide , physical extinction of a popular , is conviction , but ethnocide , ethnocide destruction of the lifestyle , not only is convicted , but it 's not just convicted , but it 's a burn , the strategy development .
And you can 't understand the Tibet is not part of the Tibet until you 're going to get from the beginning .
I 've lost the 6,000 miles from China , Western China through the South Eastern Tibet , and I got to Lhasa with a young links , but only came to Lhasa , I realized what we feel about .
6,000 sacres sacres in polymutinely and cencounters .
1.2 million people killed the military during the Cultural Rivolution .
The father of this guy was at the Panchen Lama .
which means that it was killed to the time of the Chinese English invasion .
His , it smote with the Santity during the display that he brought the popular in Nepal .
His mother been impresoned and his colpath was recognize .
It was taken to hide on careful at the age of two years , hidden under his gonna because he couldn 't have lived without him .
The sister , which did the same , was put in reeducation .
One day he washed a day shared fashion Mao and , for this transgression , was put the workers on the works for seven years .
The Tibet can be insopurable , but the reinside of the Tibet is present .
Finally , it 's all reduces to a choice .
We want to live in the monoromationy or we want to according the world of diversity ?
The great anthropologist Margaret Mead , before he died said his biggest beholding was that , in our going to go to this love of the world , we 're going to see the whole game of human imagination , we 'll think about the whole game of human imagination , but one day we 're going to wake up from a sonnap , but one day we 're going to wake up from a sonnake .
And it 's humiliating our species is existed for 600,000 years .
The Neolitical Revolution , who gave us the agriculture , which has done us to the culture of the seed of the clerarchie with the clerarchie , creating the gerarchy of the specialization , and we talk about 10,000 years ago .
The modern world has been 300 years .
That 's a few story doesn 't suggests that we have the answers to all the challenges that we 're going to deal with the millennia to come .
When these miridge of the world is asked what it means to be human , they say to be human , they respond with 10,000 different arts .
And that 's in these answers that we all riscover the possibility of being what we are : a kind of consciousness , which has to make all the people and all the people can truly truly floating . And there 's great moments of optimism .
I took this picture on the north of the island of Baffin , when I went to the Baffin the Baffin the Inuit , and this man , Olaya , Olaya , I told his grandfather .
The government was not always gentleman with the Inuit and in the ' 50s and the 1950s to stabilists our , we 've rinchips them in colonies .
The grandfather was refused to the granding there .
The family , I teants for his life , and I took them all the arms , and all his attices .
You have to know that Inuit doesn 't temise the cold , exploit .
The batts of the origin were made of heads of cartos .
The grandfather was not intimise by the Arctic or the libraries , or the libraries ,
It 's gattacked away , it 's calculated the skin skin and defected in your hand . When the bits , I did the bad , they 've been congelated , and they 've been working on a bama .
He 's sprued up on the door of this cables and when it became solid , he killed a dog .
He showed the dog and created a bridaughter , with the house house hangle created a sleep , and he 's disappeared on the bankers , I knew bags on the bankers .
We want to talk about cavarsely with anything ?
In the California , 1999 government reached the California reached the total control of a larger area of California and Texas mitting together .
It 's their new patria . It 's called Nunavut .
It 's a Independent territory . They 're control .
One splendido example of how a nation-state can reconciliating with his popular .
And , to finish , I think it 's pretty obvious at least at at the people who of us was in these remote of the planet , to make it connected that they 're not at remote .
For someone 's house .
They represent sections of the human imagination that they drawing up at the high of the days . And for us all , the dreams of these kids , as the dreams of our children , become part of the hope .
Finally , we have National Geographic we are convinced that politicians will never get to nothing .
We believe that polemiics --
[ Apauses ] no persuits , but we believe that stories can change the world , and maybe we 're the best institution to tell the world , and maybe we 're the best institution to tell the world 's stories of the world . Every our website . Every our website .
156 countries transmit our television .
Our reviews are laughter from millions of people .
Our work is travel in the etnosphere to bring our audience in places of wonderful cultural wonderful , where they 're going to go away as well as they 're going to the central revelation of the world 's anthropology : the world 's going to be in the world 's fun , and we have to find a living plural world 's lives in a pluralistic world in a plurister world .
where the wisdom of all the people can contribute to our well-being to our collective wild .
Thank you .
I 'm going to talk about some things that I wrote in this book that I hope you 've already heard and I 'm going to evidence some links , in the notakes them .
I want to start with what I call " the " official dogma . "
The dogma official dogma of what ?
The official dogma 's official dogma dogma dogma : " If we want to massive to male the well-being of our citizens , " The way to do it is massive , the way to do it is massive liberty . "
The reason is , from a side , in the fact that freedom is in itself a value , precious value , useful , essential for humans .
On the other is that if we 're free , each of us can act for it to do everything that massive to do everything that massive .
The way to massive freedom is massive chosen the choice .
The more choices people have , the more choices are free , and more than their own freedom is their well-being .
This , I think , I think , it 's so deeply radicated in society that nobody would dream to doubt .
And it 's also deeply reached in our lives .
I 'll show you some examples of what progress has done possible .
This is my supermarket . It 's not particularly big .
I 'm just going to make me a simple note about condition .
In my supermarket , there are 175 conditions , no contact 10 oil variety of oil and the 12 hundred across the balsams and 12 bunch that nobody of the 12 circumstance in the circumstance that nobody of 175 ready ready ready ready ready ready to your degreatly degree .
That 's what supermarket is .
And then you go to the electronic store to buy a stereo : CD , lector CD , radio , radio , the CD , radio , the prints , the amplificator .
And in this single electronics , there 's a big clean audio number of components .
We can make six million and a half million different combination using the components that there are only one store .
You have to admit that there 's a lot of choice .
The camps : the world of communications .
Once I was a child , they could get all the phone services , you could get all the phone services that they were very mother for mothers .
It 's given the phone , you didn 't buy it .
A consequence of that , by the phone was that the phone never break .
These days went .
Now we have a lot of telephones , especially in the phones , especially between the cellular .
Here 's the cell phones of the future .
My favorite , the MP3 , the MP3 , cut hair , and the high high hait .
If you don 't see it in the negotie in the house , you 're going to be going to be well .
And what the end is that people enters are going to go into the store and and does this question . And you know , what is the answer ? The answer is " No . "
You can 't buy a cell phone that doesn 't do it too much .
So , in other aspects of life that are much more important than the aqueness of the aqueness of the philosion of choices .
Assisteness health : it doesn 't happen in the United States you walk from doctor and doctor , you have to do .
Instead , you go from the doctor , and doctor says , " OK , we could do A , or B , " As you have these benefits and these risks " B " has these benefits and these risks " B " has these risks . "
You say , " Dr. " What should I do ? "
And the doctor says , " A has these benefits and these risks , and B has these benefits and these risks . "
" What do you want to do ? "
And you can rebad : " Dr. " Would you , what would it do ? "
And the doctor : " But I 'm not . "
The result , we call it " autonomy , " which is what it looks like .
But in fact , it 's not that a moment is the responsibility of taking someone knows about it , is doctor , to someone else knows -- and someone else knows -- and almost of course , is not in the ideal condition to make that patient .
There 's a huge marketing of pharmaceutical products , direct to people like me and you , that if you think about it doesn 't have any sense , because we can 't buy them .
But if we can 't buy them , why do they publishing them ?
The answer is that they want to be that doctor to ask us to change the receptor .
Something that is the fundamental as is our identity is a question of choice , how you see in this vignize , " We don 't want to be driving children . Scex their texture . " We don 't want to be an identity : we need to invent identity .
And we can reinvent how many times we get us .
which means that every morning , at the morning , you have to decide that kind of person want to be .
I 'm going to look at the family and marriage , a time , common perspective , I was that they were marriage to anyone , it was that they would be the most soon as possible , and he was going to make the most soon as possible .
The only real choice was with who , not when you , and not not when , and not even what to do after .
For a day , all , it 's really to play .
I teach very intelligent students , and I give them 20 percent of work as I 'm working with less of time .
And not because they 're less bright now , not because they 're less diligent .
but why are they impent , I 'm asking , " Would I be married or not ? "
" Would I be marrier later ? I have to think about the kids or career ? "
They 're logorange interrogative interrogorange interrogative .
And they 're trying to answer these questions , even if this implay not completing the tasks that achievement and not get a beautiful vote to my own .
And they have to really do that . They are important questions .
Now , the work : we 're lucky , like Carl underneath , because it allows us to work every day , from every day , from every day , from the Hotel Randolph .
In the parently , there 's a correct correct , and I won 't tell you , where the WiFi is works .
I don 't tell you , because I want to use it .
What does this incredible freedom of choice that we have about work ? It 's that we have to work ? It 's continually decided , if we have to work or not .
We can go to see our child playing warm , with the cell phone in a pockberry , Blackberry in the other , and the notetebook , and the notebook , and the notetetea .
And even though they 're all spent , every minute that we see our child rotate , we also wondering , " Do I have answering this called ? "
" I have to say that ? I have to emboze this letter ? "
And even when the answer is " no , that makes the experience of your child 's game very different than what would be in other conditions .
So , from any part of the one of the little things , big things , materials and further materials and lifestyle , life is a question of choices .
The world was this : that 's that , there were some chance , but not all that was a question of choice .
The world today looks like this : The dilemma is : Is it a good thing , or negative ?
The answer is Shand , the answer is .
We all know , the slightly layers , so I 'm going to talk about the negative ones .
All this choice company two two negative effects of the people .
The first , paradoxically is that produces paralysis that produces instead of liberation .
With toptions between which choose choose , it becomes very difficult to do it .
I 'll give you an example , a meaning study , a conduct to the volunteers .
A colleaged my college data , the gigantic data , the gigantic society of funding with about a million clients of implying in 2,000 different companies .
What she found was that for 10 solutions that are coming to 10 solutions that are offered in more , the percentage of two percent .
With 50 funds , there 's 10 percent in less adions than when they 're only five percent of them , as they 're only five percent . Why ?
Because with 50 funds of which choose is to choose , is very difficult deciding , and choice is to be back to the inmorrow .
And then , then , I 'm going to ask , questions , and , of course , tomorrow , and of course , never cut up .
You know , not only that these workers are missing food for canoes , they 're not going to be dogs because they don 't have enough money , it 's so ostic that they lose the funds of the complementary the dator 's worker 's funds .
Don 't participating , they 're losing to five dollars for the dator 's dator , which would be well disposed to versary them .
So the paralysis a consequence of having too much choices .
And I think it makes the world like this .
" And finally , " labels , " ketchup , " ketchup , "
You want to take the right decision , if it 's for eternity , right ?
You don 't want to choose the bottom , and neighborhood , and even the wrong condition .
So this is the first effect . The second is that we can avoid the paralysis and make a choice , we 're less satisfied by the outcome of how we would be with less options between what we would choose .
And that 's for a different reasons .
One of these is that with many condless of them in which choose choose , if you buy one and it 's not perfect , is to imagine that you could have a different choice that you could make a different choice that would be better . And what happens is that the alternative imagined us industries to be better . And that 's the deallows that you have been able by the decision ,
And even when it was a good decision .
The more choices there are , the easier is easy to be displeasant than any dectal than choices .
And there is what economists call constant opportunities .
Dan Gilbert asked very well as the value that we have to things to things that we 're going to do with .
In the rest , when there 's lots of options , is easy to represent the characteristics of the scarticles and be less satisfies and be less satisfies .
So here 's an example . I realized with all the people who are not New York .
But that 's what you probably think .
There 's this couple of Hamptons .
a place of luses .
Samount . Great 's right now . It 's all for them .
Nothing . But what he thinks is , " Well , it 's Aggoden . "
" Everybody my neighbors at Manhattan is away . "
" I could talk about front of house . "
And it spend two weeks , from the idea that 's losing -- every day -- the possibility of parking -- the possibility of parking .
The constituenced up for what we have , even when choice was excellent .
And the more of the options we have to consider , the characteristics are going to be returned out of how constantly constantly opportunities .
Here 's another example .
This is a lot of things about it .
It 's about living the moment , and maybe there 's a living sently .
But the most important point is that anything you choose , you know , you know , you know , you know , not to do other .
The things we don 't choose have so many attractive attractive that can make less attractive things that we do .
Third : Two : existence of the expectations .
I tried it on my skin , buying a new jeans .
I 'm just going to jeans .
And once the jeans were only one kind of , they bought them and besty , they were dissive , just after they had taken them a life and worked , they started to go well .
So , I went to buy a new when the old ones were gone , and I said , " I need a couple of jeans , this is my cutines . "
The commit told me , " He wants to me slim , he recognize fit ? "
You want them with the buttons or with the buttons ?
" You want to want to strapped them ? "
" Sotten them want to be honey , blaw , blaw , blaw to elencare .
I was balororororthized , and after a while I was the only kind of , " I want the guys that was the only " had , " I tried to all of the maledities , and then I went out from the store , I went out from the store , yourself , with the best couple of jeans that I had ever had .
It was the massive . I had the whole choice , I had got the best .
But I felt worse .
Why ? I wrote a whole book to figure that .
The reason I was that I was that with all the choice of my aspectative was high , jeans had to be perfected .
I had expectative I had expectations . I wasn 't expected anything that was just a guy , but when it was only seen 100 different , and they were in 100 different , they had to be perfect .
What I had was buy , but not perfect .
After I had compared that choose with what I was trying to do with what I was trying to do .
The additions of options in the life of people don 't make that expectations that these have respond to excellence the options itself .
And this will produce less satisfy , even when the results are good .
No one in the world of marketing in the world of marketing .
Because if they know , you wouldn 't know what I 'm talking about .
The truth truth is more like this .
" The reason he was better when he was worse " The reason you were better when he was worse was worse , when he was worse was worse was possible to meet .
Forse , in the world that we live -- opulents , industrialized , industrialized that we can hope is that the things are at the height of the expectations .
You never surprised because your expectations , you have never surprised because your expectations , you have no stages .
The secret of happiness -- what you 're here -- is , " Basse " Yes , " Basse " Yes , you want . "
I mean , little authobiography -- which I 'm actually mared and my wife is really amazing .
I couldn 't do better , I didn 't have to do that .
But you don 't always have a bad thing .
And finally , a consequence of the comprare a couple of jeans is that when you 're not just that when you 're not satisfied , and you ask , " Why ? "
" Who is responsible ? "
The world is responsible . What could I do you do ?
When there are hundreds of jeans , and you buy a purpose , and you bought a totally , and you ask who 's responsible , is as a clear that responsible you .
You 've got to do better .
With hundreds of variety of variety of variety , there 's no exuse for the insuccess .
So when people take decisions , even if the result is , they feel worth , they feel involved in and they give the hit to them .
In the last years , the depression is exploded in the last years .
I think a significant factor -- not the only , but important -- of this wave wave is that people have deludate experiences because the standards are too high .
And when they have to explain this situation think that colors are them .
So the final result is that in general , we 're better , objectively , but we feel worse .
Let me remember .
This is the official dogma , what we all take for good and it 's completely fake . It 's not true .
There 's no doubt that a little bit of choice is better than haven 't at all but from this is better than having at all of choice is better than one .
There 's a critical value , magic . I don 't know what it is .
But I 'm sure that we 've been doing this from a piece of the level where choices are improve our life .
Now , from political point of view -- I almost finished -- from political point of view , the political point .
What you all this choice in industrial society is material equipment .
There are many places in the world , and you know , you know , where the problem isn 't they have too choices .
The problem is that they have too a little bit of them .
So the face that I 'm talking about is a mal-exclusive of modern , the Western society .
And what he does have to be this : Steve Levitt talked about how much those cost and the discovered you about how much of those cost and discovered seats to boys are inured . It 's a spreak of money .
I mean these choices , complicated and dispendious , it 's not that they 're just inured .
I 'm saying of deleteries .
They make worse worse .
If a little bit of what our societies are allows choice was reversed in those where people have too few possibilities , it would not be a few chance , not only their life to improve , but also our own .
This is what economists call a paretly improvement .
A redistribution of the income is good at all -- not just the poor -- because of this choice , because of this choice , excess that it comes back to us .
To conclude , " You can become everything you want , "
You know , you know , you think , " What does that fish ? "
" It 's obvious that you can 't make it into a glass . "
" A castrated imagination , a limited vision of the world --
and that 's what I 've interpreted it so , at the beginning .
But then , you know , instead , I realized that the fish knows the long-gone .
Because the reality of fact is that if you eat the bocle , so that it 's possible , " you don 't get the freedom . You can 't get the freedom .
If you break the bock so that all you can decrease as possible decrease .
Let 's get the paralysis , and you 'll reduce the well-being .
They need a sphere .
This is almost certainly too , maybe even for the fish , and even for us .
But the absence of some symbolics is a recipe for inficity and , for roine , for robine ,
Thank you for heart .
