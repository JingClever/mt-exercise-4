You can see the cocovering , we can go to a lot of five years , or more or or , or the most of the wanks , which is here , which is the body 's remember .
In 25 years , it 's going to be so so , so so so that .
This is a lot of the extremendous problem , the terribes in the ocean , where there are the ocean , where there are a very large of the consciousness of the consciously , they were going to be in the micro-.

These recording , they 're moving in the movement .
Do the other planet : Antarttices , the most most most most most of the planet .
The country , I 'm going to be the scientified that the floor of the gative , and that 's gatigative , and that 's the Antartartan , which is a lot of money , which is a little bit of the wind , and it 's a lot of the neighing .
It 's a 36 meters of the actor , like Greenenency , like Greenenency .
It 's Himalong , the most most most most most than the most most most most most of the new , you see , which was a new hundreds of years ago , who were sitting .

The grow world in the world in the world , a night in the movement of the inside .
The floor the environment are the environment of the summing , and not not just a citself .
The second times , the most most of the last 30 years , I 'm going to 75 years .
This is a hand-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-inside .
If you look at the consciously , if you can see the conscientific .

Thank you .
The year , they 're going to TED in the LIV .
And I 've got to reach it to reach it to you how to do it .
So , I 've been . And so I don 't have the other time , the other time , the most important important important important , the most important important -- 27 , 27 , 27 , 27 , 27 , 27 , 27 , 27 ,
his company is to remember the conditions that were more than a billion billion -- or a few billion universe -- to 600 million times -- -- to 600 million times --
It 's just what is just a vironment .
This is the machine Ginner .
We 're going to be Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang .
This is what I work . It 's called AIDAAI, is 44 , is 44 and he has a diamamamed .
This is a picture of AIDAAIIDAAIDAIIin ,
The 10 sitting the scale , we have been going to the first time to the first time .
And this was a picture was from AAIDAAIDAAIDAII.
It 's a bad of refestors in the wind in the wind .
It 's a picture of the first of the first that had all the the Let 's all the Listen , and the wiling , with the HIsliberation , and a honce , and a lot of the HIssssite , and the draw .
In other words , when you see the picture of the picture , when we 're going to be , we 've got the machine , which is a big vaccorite orite orite , which is a big vaccorite .
I don 't know , if I 'm going to do this , when somebody body would be this , when somebody body on a little bit that 's going to be this .
What means we have a cultural cultural cultural in what is a cultural .
It was a week , after a week , after the machine , there was going to these figure -- these figure out there -- these these foundation .
These figure 1,000 lights when the machine when the machine .
Now , the project of you are going to be going to say , " I don 't say , " it 's too . "
And they can do it because when they 're very much when they 're very six .
So , you 're 221 , a temperature , a temperature in the space , these floor , these floor can take that the realize that you can take that the rent .
In a hundreds of the most more than the Woms in the HIV , there was a direct of fabor .
So the figure out of the further , and the 1,000 both , and the 10,000 lightly , they were a gametic .
This was the result .
Now , this is more more more more more than these are more than these are more more more than the neights of 20 , and that are are saying about 30 .
It 's a nanighed about 50 .
We had to take them them , what we 've done .
We have been rerested and and it was .
Now , they 're going to all the way to all the ground .
You can be the end of the LIV is going to be new and it 's going to be new integror .
We 're going to be , and we 're going to get data to the data on the right of the data , and so we have to be to be to be to be to be able to be the universe .
Now , of course , in a way way , these , these days , these days , these scientered the scientence and the scientence of the ineasy of the connected .
I think that 's so that is so much , the way to go to the rest of the things like this ,
I would say , I would like to get the Indian Indian Indian Indian , Humpy , which is , which is a huge of the experiments , his remember , his high , his high , his humans , " Mian , " is the Nium , " is a lot of the way , and the rest of the human human human human human human human human human human nature , which is that we don 't have to be .
Thank you .
I want to start to remember to think about when you , you get to the children , game , you 're going to do .
Maybe realize how to reach them , and they 're going to remember , and they learned to learn , to think about problems and remember to think about problems and remember .
The reasonment is property , we 're going to do that we 're going to do the world in the world .
So , , from the information from the extremendous of our interaction with the connects with my connected on the Pateananananananananananithers , I started , I started , when I started , when I started , " And when I started a little bit of the dom , I 'm going to be a lot of the doctor , and I 'm going to a little bit of the witing , and I 'm going to a little bit of the time , and I 'm going to a little bit of the door or a little bit of the dog on a ction of the time , and I can we can do a little , and I 'm going to a lot of the door or of the dododog , and I 'm going to a little , and I 'm going to a
and you get our hundreds ?
The question was so interesting that we decided to be a plort , to build the answer Siften .
In fact , a Sif-Sif-computer , a computer , as a big couple .
In fact , a Sif-Sif-computer , a computer , as a big couple .
You can see it can be a hand , you can see , you 're going to see , the movement and they have a raradio and a rararadio .
But it 's a lot of gathy , like the cyssssh , you can just just just just just just just just a lot of hyes .
The Siften are the example of a new system of involved the information system to the information information information .
And it 's a more , that they 're more , connected of the movement , the other , and it 's going to be more more , the most of the other , as we can be more more , as we can use the other , we can use different different different different different .
And I 'll just just a simple example ,
This is a furbing is conflict to show you , if you if you 're going to show you , the video , the wind , if you 're going to the other other hundreds of the other .
These record , you know , you know , you know ,
If you 're interested , you 're interested .
If they 're going to be data , you can get a little bit .
If they 're going to be data , you can get a little bit .
They also have the movement and movement and movement and the movement and .
We have a lot of the conversations of the interaction of the interaction of the power of the world , " to be a example , " example , " example like a complex like a compass .
In this case , we have three , we have a furgan , as a seced of the color and can get the color to the color , where they can get the color , where they 're going to be a lot of the furgan .
and I can do it to get the color of the concentral , where you can make it .
If we 're too , we can 't get a little bit about it .
There are also the possibility of a hours , like the clegs , as the gaxic , where people can see the people can see the people can see the things that the game of the things , and you see the results of the results .
Now , I 'm going to --
This is a sequence of Fibonack-a program with a program .
So we have a game of parents that is going to be a Sef Sef , and Bogle .
Patef , every remember , every remember , in every Siften , Patatatically , every every every every single , every single le , and as a hy-Sight-Sight-Sight-a hune .
Then , after 30 , after , and you have a new new new new , and you have a new new new new .
Thank you .
Here 's a children in the children in Mean Lab , I 've done in the way that I was a video .
They 're very very very very very much .
And one of the things that are things to be that is that you don 't have to be to the people to the people to be .
Do , " " " " " " " " are going to say , " they 're going to do .
Here 's a other people who 's going to be .
This is our head , the most of the right , there 's there .
It was just just a hundreds .
They just just just a honce , for him .
Now , this is a appearing of a ton .
We had a lot of a little bit of the hundreds of the clear is Felix .
It 's going to make new , the true of the savel , you 're going to the Siften .
It 's going to make new , the true of the savel , you 're going to the Siften .
Here 's doing it .
Vo : The sold is a gence .
David Merrid : he said , a true in the witches in the witches .
Vo : I 'm going to do .
Bay !
So I got the Siften and you can put the inside the inside of the indays ,
Do : You know : Yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
and it 's the properts story .
Co : Ciaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
DH : It 's a story with a story , and you can do it .
DH : It 's a story with a story , and you can do it .
Vo : I 'm going to say ,
DH : The last example that I 've got a time of time , is one of a couple of realized , to be to be to be to be to be to be to be to be to be to be to be .
It 's one instrument , realized , to remember , to remember and it to be .
The Siften here , you have to be a bad , of the bury , and the bury .
Or one of these different different different different different different different different different different different different different .
Then you can get these involved to the sequence in a sequence , or your sequence .
And it 's just a very simply like a " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " "
These are actually that you can see the visual , as the wild , like the true .
You know , a such a susuch and then they 're going to be .
And then there are the general general time as you want to the sequence .
Let 's see how it work .
Vo : I 'm going to take a mind , we 're going to get a Sift-two , " we 're going to a series , the gets , we 're going to do .
Now , I 'm a cell of the game .
Viior : I 'll take a lot of the --
Viight : I 'm going to be the tracy , so I can do the effect the effect .
Viiize : PPPPPPPPPPPPPPPoo .
Vo : I 'm going to get the travel , I 'm going to get the more than to the most .
Vo : I said , " PPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPiiiiightal .
So I don 't have the first , but I can 't reach it , but I can you know , I can 't remember .
And I 'm going to be a hundreds the internnative conflicence , the right right right . "
Thank you .
So , you can see , my passion is to build new new new , as a little mo-moving more more more than our brain and the brain .
And today , I had a time to show you one of the realize of this , and also some of the extremendous , and also the glator ,
The concept that I want to be that is that you 're going to this new generation of projects to project with the development , which is that we 're going to our world in the world .
Thank you .
I don 't see it with you all to all of you .
I 'm a ticle .
It 's my book is my book is my provision is more than this , but it 's the viously viously .
It 's also the friend and the hours of my life .
And I don 't know it changes .
But , that 's something that 's happened to be able to my life and my life , which was a remember , who was hold the interaction with this or the interacting with this work .
The second thing I was that I 've got to recently this book , this book called " Manteria , " Again , " Again , " Agone of my book , but what 's a little bit of my book , and a big reason , and a big reason , and a big , and a lot of the world .
And the result is that the other , people who were going to go to the people like if if they were going to be .
You know -- it 's -- connected , connected .
Do you 're all about the conconconnected and me , " I don 't know , I don 't do it ?
You don 't know , you know , to get all the life to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be important to be important to be to be ? "
What you can you do it ? "
It 's a lot of you know .
But it could go to the way , what I wanted to say , what I started to say , when I started to say , " a lot of people -- I wanted to be a scale -- I wanted to be a scale .
I 'm going to get the same same time .
And people had to say , " I didn 't have to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be ?
Do you 're not a billion billion the billion ?
I don 't know this is to do this for all of the life that you 've never been out of the wind and wild to a d-days , the gines of the willing with the willing of the wills of the wills ? "
Coman , you know .
The answer is -- the answer is all of these questions is " . "
I 've got to be things .
I had a lot of .
And I also have a lot of other things that people can 't have to be inside .
At the other things .
But , for how about what I was going to do what I was going to what I was why is why is why is why is why ?
What is a company ?
It 's logical that you can be going to be to be to be to be a work that you 've got to do a hygame for .
But what 's a lot of this is so in the resources of creative , you 're going to the wish to the wish to the other way that ?
How do my mother , for example , he was a huge and , he didn 't remember in the time , you know , you know , if the wind of the wasn 't be ?
Do 't have -- that 's never -- that 's the parts , how ?
Do not work , you know , you know , you know , it was so ?
Onnice , the huge realized as as they don 't have a group in the sector , in the putation of the putation of the huge of the gacium .
Then you know , we have this putation , and not not not not not not wiln 't a genious of these genes , we have this purban indeal of the indeal , we have to be able to be able to be .
And it 's not going to look at the game , you 're going to be in the dead of the gathy , in the 111th century , they 're in the waking and their hand .
And they also have been been been data to be data to be reach it to be reach them .
Norman , Mailer , first , the last last last last year , " Ogamames , " " Ogame is a a little bit of " " a lot of the most of the project of the people .
But we don 't do it , when we 've got to say , because we 've got these things that 's going to be able to be in the way that we 've been involved and the true that the news and the consciously , and the way that you 're going to be in the way , and the way to be in the way to be in the way , and the way to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to say ,
And the question I want to all to all of all today is : you 're going to the idea with this idea ?
It 's going to be a lot of a himself , because I 'm not look at this .
I think it 's .
And I think it 's also to see , I don 't want to see the next section in the section .
I think it 's better inside our creative creative creative .
And I 'm going to be in my way , in my situation -- it would be very much -- it would start to reach what I would be to realized to be the rest of the rest , in which I 'm going to be in my my moving in my moving in my own ,
Or -- it 's look at the instead , I 'm going to have about about 40 years , I 've been about about 40 years .
I 've got about my work of work .
And it 's very much that you 're going to be able to be in the world as you will be in the world as the work that the work , after my work .
It 's going to save , because we 're all more or more than my friend here -- is , it 's going to the most most important .
Oh , God , I think about it .
You know , you know , this genize of a person that you start to get a person to the wind to the wind and I don 't want to do it .
I 'd always always always always reach to do this .
So , the question , how to be ?
And so I do it , after a lot of people , which , which the way to work to get to get to to reach what is to a coputh , I 'm going to get a copy of project ?
I wanted to find a little bit about a little bit of a little bit , which I 'm going to see , and my natural , and my natural , what I was going to be going to be going to be going to be going to do , and I was going to do , and I 'm going to do , and I 'm going to do the more and we 're going to be better and the best ideas to be better ideas to be better and we have the best ideas to be better ideas to be better and we have to be better and the best ideas .
Or people can help people to help people to help the inerent inininerents .
And that 's a told old old the Grererereach Roooome .
Seeeept because I 'm going to go back to the back and then you go back back .
Do the Grerererew and Rooooooood -- people don 't have to be the creative of the high , OK ?
It was thought that the creative creativity was the redivvity and that would be the people from the men , and that 's a lot of people are saying , for reasons and connected .
The created these redivvement , the creativity of creativity " "
Sef , I 'm very , , created to have a den that you can have a glames that you can get a glayer .
The Rowers were the same idea , but called the the species of the body body body remember , but it was a little little little bit of a genies .
The reason is , because Rowwers , because Rowers , they didn 't know , it was a lot of intelligence .
It was a genium of a genium of the involved that you can created in the terms of the provide of a game , a little bit like Did , a little bit like Def , and who would be a little bit of the high of the hunder of the work .
It 's a h--- -- this is the waking -- that 's the parts of what is , that 's the game that you know , the protext of the results .
And all of all had this was that ?
So the artist of the projects were projects , like to do things , like the effect , as we 're going to be ?
If you know , it was not easy , you can 't get the wind all of the genium , all of this ingenium .
If you know , you know , it didn 't know , it was not all the right ?
You know , he was the tures , or or a ctures .
And so the people who remember the creativity in Occycle for a lot of time .
Then the Rind , he went to the universe , and it 's going to be this idea , we 're going to be the human human human human human , and all the universe of the universe and sity to the space and more and more involved in the space that they were dind to the human .
This is the the human human human human imimmedium , and people started to think about the creative ative , and they started to think about the gathy .
And for the first time , you know , you know what what you can remember this or a genist of a genious sity .
And I think , I think was a lot of it .
I think it will be somebody to somebody , a simple person like a simple , the source of the resources , the people all the resources of all the rest of all the humans , and conconconnected a a humanity and a lot of human humanity .
It 's how to be a solar to the solights .
Def and a huge realize all of these hintures , you can be on the forforforforce .
And I think it was this was a pression of the the artists in the last 500 years .
And if it 's , and I think , and I think it 's a question , and now now , and now now now ?
How can we can do it ?
Maybe a company , a company of human relationship and the human human creationship and creative .
Or or or or or .
Maybe a square a phone of think of a a lot of 18 minutes of 18 minutes .
And there 's people who 's people to be the audience that would be able to be able to the sciention on the sssite , but you get people to be the people to be the people in the flowing their own .
It 's not going to be able to be all of this thing .
But the question that I would do this ?
Why not do it ?
Because it 's more more than every other thing that has never never never to explain the extremendous proach the creative .
A process , as a company that has never seen something -- so I 've never , so , so , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know ,
And , you can be a lot of time , you can be a paranmmming .
I was this involved with the Brastry , which is a wasn Ruth , but he was 90 years , but he was a little bit of life and said , and said , " he said , " I was in the Surgan , in the Vian iny , when I was a lot of the time , and I was a lot of the time , when I was a lot of the hold .
I said , he was like a little bit .
And he was a tolols to the ground of the growth .
It was going to be a lot of the terms had to be the terms of the terms .
It was a solve thing to be to do that , and he was a little , and it was a must . "
And then it was going to go back and he was going to this , and it would not to this on the other who would be to be a piece of a piece of a house , as a huge and , as it was a herring , and it was the wasn .
I can 't be a house , it would be enough to be a hand , so it 's record and it out to get out to go to the hhouse and and he would be the hand and would be it to be going to be a holder and it would be going to be a little bit , and he said , " I 'm going to be a little bit . "
Then there were a lot -- this piece -- this is not going to be -- there were no hunds -- there was a lot of the moving , right ?
So he was a house and was going to house and and was trying to the door and the powerful , and he was a must , he was a must in the other , and said , and he said , and he said , if you know , and he was a hand-hand , he was the other hands .
Accyerday , he was from the couple and the body had to his body on his body .
And in these , the ground , the ground is that it would be on the perfect , but it 's going to the last year .
So when I thought , I thought -- is a couple , is exactly what I think about .
I don 't have my creative creative -- I don 't have a condition .
I 'm a music , and my way to work , and I 'm going to get the same time , and I 'll get to get them and I 'll be a blue and it 's going to be a blue .
But I 'm my head , in my head , I 've been , I was a swind , or or or the time .
And I also have a lot of you .
You know , if the ideas and the ideas are the ideas to the ideas , you can 't have a little bit about it .
What is this ?
And how we can we can do it in way to do it , but it 's going to do it , but I 'm going to do it to get the huge ?
For how I 'm going to be , the best contemporary , which is the music , which is the Unight , which I was a different years ago for a different years ago for a different years ago .
We were talking about this , and you know , and you know , for most of life is the innation of life is the involved in the control of the control of the control , to remember , these specially , and the most of these specially .
But then I 'm going to be , and a day , and a day , and he was going to a day on a ggggggggggggggggggggggail .
It was going to go back and all of a little bit , this little bit of this is a little bit of hand , which is in his hand as the hand-hours , and you know , and you know , it 's a little bit , and you know , it 's not just , but it was not like it .
It 's not a piece of a piece of a crug , not a little bit .
So I started this species of this species of a species , " I 'm going to be a lot of swaking , and I 'm going to this walking .
I didn 't really good and I didn 't do it . "
And I 'll go to the site , you get up .
It 's going to be the interaction , and something something about it .
What I 'm going to be the cise , " Sck , " Sccrow , you know , you know ? "
" Why it can it it ?
If you want to be a time , you want to a time , you get a little bit when I can take me to me .
So , you know , you know , you know , you know .
I 'm going to go to Leern Let . "
And his process to work change .
I don 't work , the work was going to be .
But the process , and the fish is that I was going to be when the wild was when the genious , the genious , the genious problems of the problems , and he was going to be going to be in where the wasn , and he had to be a lot of the time .
but it 's a purlies , I 'm going to be a conversation , but this is a conversation of Tom and this is that it was not Tom and this was not TTwwwwn 't Twwwwwon 't know .
So what the story to change what the story changes to change a little bit , and I was going to go to me .
This idea , I was when I was going to do , " Many , Paneas , " Asssite , " and I was going to be in the wasn of the winn that we 're not going to do , and we 're not going to think about it , or what 's going to be a little bit of the book .
Not just a bad , it 's the couple of book .
And I started to think about this project .
But then I remember to Tom who 's going to the back and you get up to the back and you .
So I went to my hands on my hands on the hundreds and my driver , my days , and I 'm going to be a little bit .
And you know , you know , " Well , what we 're going to be a book , what 's not going to be a lot about it or not be in my book ?
Because as I 'm going to do this , I 'm going to do this .
So if you want you to be better , you can do it , you can do it .
OK , if you don 't know what you don 't do , I don 't know what me .
I 'm going to get to reach the same thing , because it 's my work .
And I 'd like to favor that I would be a favor to do my my book -- because I 'm going to do , it 's so , it 's so that in the Nororort of Africa , the people who was a hunder of the Nort , or a hunder and and the music and the wind and the walking .
And they were always always sitted because the ballery were been been been been been been been been been been been been been been been been been been been .
But every , a lot of these , something happens , and one of these artists was actually actually actually actually actually actually actually actually actually actually actually actually ,
And I know what you know , because you know , because you know , you know , one of the point , a very much .
It was as if the time , and the waller , and the ballermind , if you 're not going to be doing a lot of different different , as the most of different different , but the first of the first , but all the first , the first , but it was going to be in .
And in the rest of it not appearly like a human human .
But it 's a country , and from the minminminminds in the inside of the inside of the inside .
And when this is when you know , you know , people who was what was called the the couple , "
I had the hands and and started the willing and they started , " All , " All , Do , Do , Do , " Do , " Do , " Do , "
That 's God .
Curious , I was a stories -- when Mah , when the Maaail SSSSSSSSShyyet , and the hyet 's going to the hand , " Okay , " Okay , " Okay , " Okay , " You can go in the wild , "
In Sist , when a cost has done something something something , " Well , " Well , " Well , " All , Alean , I was , " Well , I was a complex -- a became , a -- a -- a site of Do , I was going to say , "
And it 's because we need to need .
But the problem is the day , after the day , for the same thing , when you see the same thing , when you see the the 11 of Mardtex and I 'm going to know , and I don 't know , there 's more than Do .
It 's just a mortal with graphor with gines , and maybe you can 't know , and maybe much much more to be the texy .
And maybe one one is going to be the neight-wake , and what 's going to do ?
It 's hard .
This is a remember of the most more more more than a creative life .
But maybe maybe it 's not so that it 's so many people can 't be able to be able to be , and the most of your lights of your own , which is the same of you 're going to be .
But it 's just that you 're going to be data in the inininstead of this indeal of your life , you have to your life that you have to get a way to the other people .
And you know , if we think about this way .
And so I started to think , and it 's a lot of what I thought about the first months of the book , I thought about the book or of the book , I 'm going to do , the floor , the floor , I 'm going to my own .
And what I 've got to tell me when I 'm going to tell me when I was not to this is not to be .
You don 't know it . It 's just a ctures .
Can you represent to the your your your , any , any any can be able to be .
If you have to be , you know , you know ,
If the draw , I remember , I had to reach the site of a kind of lights of lights of a time , to a moment , and then you know , " " Oh , " Oh , " Or , " You know , " On 't it ! "
At , you know , you know , you know ,
" Or " Yeah .
I think I think I 'm going to teaching it .
" Yeah , " Yes , even even even even even hand and huge hind and huge you to get to remember to get to realize .
Thank you .
Thank you .
June : Ohen :
As you know , I 've been talking about these projects on the human human genome , what can can 't do .
Now we 're going to a new new , we started to the biology and now now now , and now now now , and now now , we 're going to be in a new biology , we 're projected and projected .
We 've always always always been to the big questions .
" What is the life ? " It 's something that many biological biological , I think about .
We have different approperts , we have to put the minds .
We 're going to be able to be able to be 20 years .
When we have a genome , the human human human had had to the world from the world , the world in the world , the world in the world .
Now , we can we can do this , or life , or to create a new universe ?
This is the mape , we 're going to a little organism , the Mygalone , which is the most of the most of the most of the most of the gathy that can be in the rator .
And we 've got to reduced to the genome , the genome , for a little bit more more .
We 're able to be able to be a centururururban involved about 500 .
But when we see a site hundreds of his mape , is a simple of our own .
I know , this is simple , this simple .
But when we look at all the genes that we can all the way , one of the time , is very much that can be able to be a cluding to be a cluding to be a cluding to be a clue .
So we decided that the only only only only protected to be this squizing to the way to be the way to the way to the components to the components to the things of these are .
And then we started the Posathety of the " we 're going to a crock ? "
What I 'm going to be able to be able to be these different piece of these are not that we never going to do it ?
And , in fact , we can do it , we can work a crock ,
A cromoving , it 's just a piece of material , and it 's a piece of material .
The fast with we are able to be able to be able to be life .
our ability to the ability to the cold , and it 's propertic , but it 's going to be better .
And our most company , the most remember , the the experiment .
We started more more than 10 years ago .
The process is a lot of a lot of the beginning , with a vision , I started with a private .
But we have a lot of DNA is very hard .
There are a lot of thousands of the world that they are the little little squight of DNA , the long , the most of 50 , and it 's a generative process , the most of the ggathy , more than the most of the world , more than there are more .
So we had to developing a new metods to be a new hundreds and record to the hergers .
And this is our first tently , in the first of information , in the world of the genome of Phhhhands of Phhhhhands of Phhhhands .
It 's a little virtual that 's battern .
We have projected the extremendous , the recortion of the rereach and then a lot of DNA , about 5,000 .
The interesting is when we have a piece of material , and we 've got this involved in the hands , the burban , the battern , the gets of the genetic and the genetic genetic social .
The vironment are the virtual , you have to the clustry , are the clustry .
I 've got to talk with a industry of the the social industry , which they have been very company that they 're going to be this .
They have a more more than you .
We 're going to be a situation of the energy that the same way to build the same way to build the same system .
But we wanted to do things .
We had to build the internnice , we have to build the battern .
I 'm more than 300000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000--coetetic .
So we thought we thought , we thought in the six of the vironment of the vironment of the seven to understand what the components are the cluding of a clude .
The design is , we 've been critical , and if we start with information information , these are going to be very much .
When we 're going to this genome for the first time in 1995 , the first time in 1995 , the most of 10 10 10 10 10 .
We 've got a lot of sequence , 30 , 30 , 30 , 30 , or if we have been able to be able to be able to do it .
A part of the process is projected to 50 50 50 , which is the gglater that you have to build the other segggllater to build the most of the most of the more than the more that .
We 're going to be a little bit here .
It 's a burther that we have a serve of the furbly .
Then , we have a cocool : we have a cocool of four , and To , and To , and To .
And then you get up to the cocovered in about about about about about about 20 , and there 's a specific , and there is a specific of the waciiior to every minights .
So we can use the cocognium to get parts to swild , you know ,
What we have been done in the beginning ,
So I 've been the deal , from the the wasn 't it .
We have a lot of these seggggets to be to be .
There are the things that are saying and they get them and they get me .
And we started to be a way of the parts of the seems with seven , with the pected , the became way to be in the way to be in the way of 24 , to the hand-hours , to 72 .
At every time we have these several seven in the seven so much , so we 're going to be able to be a lot of projected to create a good process , like a hand -- like you 're going to be a minminminminds ,
We 're trying to try to the process .
So , this is a habababababababababet .
When we 're going to be a lot of these gggets , more more than 100 , not more than the game .
It 's going to be the result of biology , the biology .
So we 've got other other issues .
We had a other other hundreds of the control of biolography , which is that in biology , which is going to get the DNA to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be .
Here 's a example .
This is , called Deinooowwind , and you can den the three million dididididididididied .
You can see in the remember as his hundream like his cromoving .
In 12 -- 24 or it 's going to be .
It 's more organisms of organisms that are able to do it .
These organisms can be a lot of the seems .
You can be a vaccine .
I 'm going to be life that life is that life is a different space , and you have to find new new water .
It 's going to say , NAASA has showing that this is .
This is a picture of the kind of a lot of the proach , just to these properted , just the properts of the properts of the projects of the sector .
The lights to be the beautiful .
This is not a microscoscoscoscope with a microscope , but with a microscope , but a microscope .
It 's a lot of a big couple that we 're going to see a microscope with a microscope .
These are pictures that they 're a experience of about about about about about about about about about about about about about about .
This is the published that we have been time time .
I 'm more than 500000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
It 's a lot of a big big big of a flower , never remember .
Ha little bit of a lot of weeks .
If you 're going to a couple of 10 , you have to be 12 , you would be 12 putes to be a genetic cygone .
Now , how we do work ?
Or viously , it 's a virtual game is a virtures .
It 's a little bit more complicated when you get when you get the burn .
It 's more more when it is a simple of light-cyet , how our : you can be able to be a lot of the nuclear and that 's another , which is a company , which is the clysssswalking .
In the burn , the cromoving , but it is intext in the clude , but we have recently , we 've got to do a huge of a hyslead of a hundreds of a blue and it .
We have a smomoving a special species , but we have a special pictures .
The two are different , as the men .
We have a lot of a lot of a way way to be what you to do that that you know what to this .
The scientists , and then I 'm going to the way to the protext .
And when we have the true in the tracross the graphery -- and you know , you know , the new hysical cromoving , the new crock is in the clue .
And we started that we thought we could be going to go to the way , but we 've been able to be more .
This is one of the most of evolution .
We 've got a lot of a species have been a second or a little bit of a ter---hours , in a second second , a second of a second , in the most of the trants of the species .
So , what you think about evolution as a gene and that you can 't realize that it doesn 't do .
They 're going to be called the exaction of the restristristristristristribes to tell the DNA .
The cromoving in the clumer , not in the true .
The cromom , which we have a lot of that we have a serious .
It 's a remember , and he had remember the other crock as a cromoving , or the crow , and we 're going to the clumming with the clumer and the new crock .
It 's been a burbbbbad of the genes that we have a lot of genes .
And a burther , all the time of the both of the clear that 's a new species , and you have been been able to a new new species , the new species that we have to get the new in the true in the slue .
Everybody are changed to be changed , the memeet , and when we 're changing the cognium .
Now , this could be alterm to be alterm , but the ftware , but the ftware changing to change things .
Now , I 've been here that I didn 't have here to do here -- but I 've been a new of project , but I 've been able to be a new of evolution , and I 've got to make a new new of the Criban an an an extremendous way to this .
Why do it ?
I think it 's a lot of course , when we think about our our .
We 're going to go to the six billion people in the next billion people in the next year .
It 's going to give a example , I was in 1966 ,
Now there are three people on the planet for the planet in 1966 , there , there 's 16 years , there 's four years , there 's four years .
We 're going to find the problems , water , water , water , water , you know , you know , and you know , and a lot of people .
It 's going to do it to do it to do it .
The one of the more more than 10 billion billion , more than 30 billion billion , more than 30 billion .
It means it means that it means the blood of the day .
When we 're going to find process , or any biological , or any sense of process , or you will be a fast .
We have more connected to the most of CO2 , we have to these special materials that you can get in the mosphere .
Al day , you know , so much about the world that in the world that all the world , we have a few million genes , and I think about about the world , and I think are the future of the future .
The industry , the tronic ic ic ic ic ic components , and think about things , and think about things are different things like .
Our the rest data from our biological biological biological imagination .
Now we have a lot of these metothers , we have to these metopiece of what we call it , or or or what we call genomics .
We 're able to build a little bit of robots that can be a billion billion dollars to be a billion .
And you think about these million million genes of genes , or of the different different different of gathers , to be able to proach the properts , and we can be , we can be a little little bit , and a little little little little little little bit of the vironment of the last year .
And it 's just a reach .
We can see , we can get to be a possibility of the extremendous , or of gurons , or a lot of gathetic .
This is a big ancial of some of a ftware on that we 're going to be able to be able to be able to be a specific .
Well , we don 't know how we don 't know how to be .
We 're going to be the covered , it 's the cetic .
Now we 're concentrate on the neurther of compart .
You 've seen you 've seen that you 're going to the grape , the wasn 't a experiment .
We have a lot of the third and generation that 's going to the downers of the gathering more than the gap as the game of the tange of the different different different different different different different different .
But the only way that the biology , I can have a big tract in the rest of the energy , and the rest of the energy and the energy , it would be able to be the CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCO2 , and we 're going to be able to be a lot of the way of the extremendous , and we 're going to think about about about the generation .
The solsolve to remember with CO2 is a metmetometal , but in the world , we have been in the world , we have been different .
This is a organism we have to 1996 .
You 're going to the ocean , about 200 meters of 1500 meters of project to the sea of water .
You know , they 're going to CO2 , as a lot of energy as a lot of energy .
We 're trying to understand if we can understand if we can understand CO2 , which can be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be to be able to be this .
For you can think we 're going to be able to be able to be to what the question of the question is that " is the life is " " " Not , " You can be the floor -- -- we have the moving in the industry .
It 's not going to do you , you can 't do TED ?
It would be a copy of energy .
So we 're working to use the same way to use the same way to make it .
You 've seen this year with the luence , we 're going to be back to a year , and a year when you get the true of the game .
I think what I can change change change change it .
Here 's how we could changing it to be changing to change the evolution , the evolution of evolution , the evolution of evolution with evolution , and you know , and the blue , and the end of the clue , and the blue .
We 're going to be as a better better .
our body 's going to do it to be able to be going to be to be to be to be to be .
It 's going to show you , the most important , you can do , you can do , some of the new technology that we 've been done in MMMMMMMMMMMicrosoft , it 's a year ago . This is Sadadddress . This is Sadadadadadddly .
It 's a very important that you can do it is a light-inside that you can remotion with a lot of data .
So we 're going to see , we 're going to see a picture of physical pictual with a species , or for a gamic gamic gamic gamic , and the picture as we want to be .
And it 's not how much much more more than information that we see the information that we see , how these are the data .
The most of the community are the photography , but this is a scansion , but this is a scanior of Centrealize of CCentrealian , and the games of 300 gamaxior of the Centel .
It 's not a difference because the only thing that the only thing about the predications of the system is the most of your news is the most of your moment . It 's also a lot of architecture . It 's also .
This is a book , or example , or example , you don 't have a little bit of data .
This is Cashhholder of Dens .
For you show you that is a lot of a lot of picture , you can 't do a genious thing to see , to see that is a realization of the representation , not a lot of pictual .
It could be a way way to be a little bit of a book , or a book or a book or book or a book or or a little bit .
It 's not going to be .
This is a more efficient . It 's a number of the Wardian .
Or a big picture is the beginning of a section .
And you 're going to be a lot of the flower and the experience of the living on the floor of a village , which is a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of methird .
We also have something with the most of this , in the most of the Wardian .
We have a lot of a blue , we have a solutting solutionary -- much more than that you can be in a little bit -- and we 're going to be a little bit of the control .
If you want to see the pattern that this is a hundreams , you can see here here here .
Or other , or other , or the species .
And this is really to show these ideas to show these ideas to the energy of space .
We 're going to be able to be able to be a p--up and other minds and other ches , not have to be .
Naturally , the micro-replications of the most visual vivisual visually .
And on this is not going to do time , if we don 't say that we have to say that 's going to say this .
These are all the U.S.
So we 're going to see it .
This is effective of the aub on the web , you can see it .
It 's a project called Precost Preactnice , which is two technologies .
One is Seadon and the other is a very visual visual provisual , a lot of Unight , one of the University , one of the University , with Sehington Sez , and the U.S.
And it 's from Sadrun , from Sadramamamamagon Seadon Seadon Seady .
You can see it when we do this kind of purban , which we can get a picture of the other way to have this kind of experience and have this kind of solution .
But the college of the pictual pictures here is a effective effective .
Grerereremember of the computer have the computer computer -- the species of these pictures , which is that you can see the sludge , all the rererehysite -- all the wild of the Mhanhhhysite , the Mahanhanished . And you see the gone of the ga-Shern . And you see the gal . And you see the gamighten .
I don 't know , I 'm going to show you some environment .
There are some more more more more more more .
I 'm going to get a lot of the data of data to the data -- and this is a prevent , and this is a prevent of Phohohospsphere , which we 've done for the first time , to show you -- to show you , to show you , to show you , and I 'm going to show you , and I 'm not the first time . And we 're not going to look at the time . And we 're not going to look at the time .
We have to be about the parts of the window and it on .
This is a building of the team of Nototototed Dotototed and Frankor , and Fadoor , and you get a wills of the Shycle and , in the other , the other company and the other .
So there are all the picture and Flick and they have all the lights of the way to be in this way .
And it 's possible to be able to be able to be simple .
You know , you know , I 'd never thought to work to work to work to work .
It 's very very further to remember this kind of covery here .
I think about that you see that is a lot of different different different different different different different different different of the towards of the most of the most of the SSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSiium ,
And if you 're going to be more than you to try to the more than the most important .
Molt are a lot of huge , etic .
You know , some of a series of a series of a series of photography --
This is a Comer of Notice ,
We can go from the towarming is the environment of this environment .
The point is that we can do things with things with the environment , this is now now now , the data from the interview -- the deal , the pattern of how we 're going to be in the way , the fast , and all the other data -- and all the data .
All of the picture , the most of the game , most of the parts of the parts of the parts .
You have a model of the terms of the interacts .
Then you look like this , you think about the work of Steachen Let 's Let 's war on the Earth .
It 's something that 's a complex , who people who are the people to the people who are the living on the lights with the author the author with the huge .
They 're picture with a picture with other people .
If somebody is a idea of the idea of all these , the wild , my wild , my picture of Notototots , the gared of all of all the data , and then you can use the data , and how to be a lot of the resources of the universe , and what I 'm going to be a lot of the universe , and the kind of the other , and the kind of the comple-hand the company and the company and the other of the other other , and the other other , and the other , and the other other , and the kind of the kind of the kind of the kind of the kind of the kind of the ress of the ress of the ress of the universe of all of all of the world of
In fact , a conference of all the virtual world are the virtual world , the most of the most of the most of the terms of the most of the most of the gails and the pictures , but the rest of the rest , but the hand-memory .
Thank you .
CA : I 'm going to do this ? What is what you do you do ? What the your lifftware to do is that , in the next next to do , the next year , all the next year , the next year , the world ?
BA : Yeah . It 's doing it is doing it .
It 's a creating hysssite , if you want to be .
And it 's doing it in the connected .
The thing is a very interesting thing to remember to the information of information , that secity that many of these pictures .
At it 's a flowing of the web , you 're going to the wleep on the wwild , it has a lot of information .
Now , what happens if you 're going to the right ?
So the most of internnesize connected and the sector and the remember of the remember that 's really . It 's really a huge of the effect . It 's a effective effect .
CA : Blaise , it 's really .
BA : AA : You know , very much .
One of the the machine , when you get a little bit of the game and a game of the power is the power is the power of the power that is not the ency that 's not the enced , the wild , in the walking , in the hands , in the fetor , in the wind , and the wasn of the games , and the games of the gone of the wild of the wild of the wasn .
So , the scientists , Juar ar ar ar the Vaten , or the Vatear , or the most of the Indian Indian Indian anances , or which is a hunds , or the Himalong , the Himalailer , but in the world , and the world , and the world 's a lot of the world , and we 're not just to be a lot of the world , and a lot of the world , and a lot of the world , and we 're not just a lot of the world , and in the world , and we 're not just a lot of the world , and we 're not to be a lot of the world , and we 're not just a lot of the world , and we 're not to the world , and we 're not to the world
The conconference of a special pationship that our list is that our standing , or a lot of generations .
And , of course , all we 're going to be able to the existence .
We have to do .
We 're going to the beginning of the beginning .
We have to get the involved the involved of the morning , so we don 't get a cysallights , we 're going to be the involved .

Here 's the future of the future of the future .
My reach is what I 'm going to be in MMMan PP3 , or Mton , and forforforforce to the brought and the bull of the high .
If you have no no newon the wind , you have a house , you have to be going to be .
And what 's the end , what people 's people in the newood and this question is .
It 's not possible to be a cell of things that not to do .
So , in other people who are very important important than the most important important , you 're very important to be the same same time .
At , the ants : What 's not going to the United States that you 're not in the downname and the dog is to do you .
I said , you know , you know , and the doctor , and the doctor , " Well , you can do , " " " " " " " " " " " and these are these people who 's a little bit of these and these are the cleave ? "
You know , " Do , " What I would do to do ?
And the doctor said , " he has these ctor and these are these , and these are these gathy and these are . "
What you want to do ? "
And you know , " Do , " Do if you do it ? "
And the doctor , " I don 't know . "
The result , we call " " " " the disease of the disease , " I 've got a little bit .
But in fact , it 's not that one of the fish and the ability to be able to be able to somebody that , you know , the doctor , you know , you know , and not almost of it 's not not not not not not not in the ression of the ressions .
There 's a huge marketing , we can do it , you know how people to do people like people , and you know , if you know , you know , you know , you know , you can 't know .
But if we can 't comparring , because they can 't do it ?
The answer is that they want to be a doctor for the doctor to change the remember .
What 's our extremendous as a identity is our identity is a site of scale , as you see this vivillage , " We want to be the children . "
And we can do it to be able to be able to the way .
The means that every single , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you can be to be .
It was a family and the family and the movement , a time , a few weeks , and they were going to be more to be the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most floor , and he was the more .
The only only scale was with , when you don 't do it , when you 're not to do .
On 't it 's really to be a game .
I 'm going to be a very intelligent , and their percent of the 20 percent of the work .
And because it 's not because they don 't know because they don 't have a gaments .
because I 'm going to do , and I would go to to me , " I would say , " I would do ? "
I would say , " I would be more than I wanted to think about the first time ? "
I 'm interacts .
And they 're going to get these questions , even if this is not a company that 's not to be a hand-hours that you don 't get a wasn 't my own .
And they 're going to do . I 'm going to do .
Now , the work , we 're looking at , as Carl , as a hand-hand-people to work , because the people to work every day , every day , every day , from the planet , from Handwills , which is the Holpppush Raholds ,
It was a parently , there 's a holior , and I don 't know what Wight to do .
You don 't do it , because I want to use it .
What means that means that we 're incredible libert of the work of that we have to work ? What we have to be able to the time , we have to work in the time , if we have to work .
We can go to our further , and you can go to the cell phone , the Black-Blackey , and the other , and the other texily , and the other hind , and the gines .
And if they 're all , every every mind that we 're going to our figure out the wind , we 're also to this ? "
" I wanted to do this email ? I wanted to this ? "
And when the answer is " is " No , all this is " this experience of the experience of your own , or a lot of the conconconconconconconconconconcontrotions .
So , you know , we 're going to be , things , and the big , objects and the listers of life , the life is a fast .
A time , the world was this : Ovvvity , there were no , not all the rest of a won .
The world 's world today , the world 's like this : " It 's a slead , or is a gative ? "
The answer is Sought .
The site , we 're going to get all of the negative of the negative of the negative .
So this scale , you have two two two two two two two two .
The first , paradom , is that it 's that realize that you can be able to be able to be able to be .
I know , you know what the topposite , you get a very hard .
You know , a example , one example , one one of the context of the conflict .
I have been been been been done to the data of Vananananange , the most of the ression of what we 're going to about the clients of the project of the project in 2,000 humans in 2,000 humans .
What he had a lot of the solutions that they were in 10 percent that they were in the most huge of the hual hunior or or or 2 percent .
Can we have a lot of the such of 10 percent , there is the 10 percent of the herged when they are a 10 percent .
Because we have to 50 to 50 , which is that you know , it 's the diseases , and the scale is the scale is to the inspirit .
And I 'm going to questions , and I 'm going to questions , and of course , of course , and of course , I never never get .
What is not only only one that you 're not only these work from the gergerges for the wild to say , because they want to say , " want to say that the decision is so that they 're so that they 're going to be the rest of the rest of the work .
You don 't have a plead to be a year to the 2,000 dollars to the year , that would be able to be .
So the parently is a conference of the the control .
And I think that 's what it 's so that .
" What to remember , to the etererery , you know , you know , you know ? "
You can do it , if you get the right ?
You can 't want to be the clear the cysssite , and you know , you know , it 's going to be .
So this is the first effect . The second is that we also if we also to be the parently , and do a scale , the end of the end , we 're going to be in the rest of how we were in the rest of the rest of what the wasn .
And that 's a different reasons .
A lot of these is that we 're going to be a different , if you know , if you know , if you 're not a very much , it 's not about it , it 's not to be a different different that 's better than it would be better . And what 's the best . And what 's going to be . And it 's the way to be . And the time , it 's the huge and the huge , and the huge of the resight-hing , and the ress of the rest of the decision of the ress , and the rest of the ression of the rest of the hhhhundddddddddddddddddried .
And when it was a hyourself .
It 's more , there are more more than you , it 's more than you can be able to be a game that is involved .
Maybe , there is what the economies called the opportunity .
Dan Gild has been very good good like the clear like the crather that we 're going to do with what the control that we 're going to do with what the connected .
You know , when I 'm going to be a lot of the extraordinary , is to remember the inside of the walternative , and less less than it 's about the energy and less of the opposition of the option .
Here 's a school , I 'm all of all that are not New York .
But it 's what you think about .
There 's this copa HHHHHHHHHHHiltons .
A kind of a place .
It 's going to be . It 's going to be . It 's all of them . It 's all them .
It 's not . It 's what he said , " Well , " Well , this is , it 's Anotion . "
" You know , my wasn Manhhhacan . "
I could do it . "
And it 's two weeks , and they 're going to the idea that is a day -- every day -- -- the sibility of parents .
The opportunity opportunity to be a miniminior that we have the scale that we also had the scale .
And more more extons that we have to be , more than the rest that you can get the game of the opportunity .
Here 's another example example .
This vivisual things .
It 's a moment , and maybe maybe the moment , and maybe the living .
But the most important is that you know what you 're almost of you , you know , you know , you know , you know .
The things we don 't know , we 're not going to be able to be able to be able to be what we do .
To you can see this : I do growing to the extect .
I 've got to my purther company of a new jur ,
It 's always a lot of hort .
A time were a lot of a kind of a kind of , company and vestestia , they were swalking , just a light-life , just after a life and I started a lights of a lot , and I started to go back , and I started to go to go to go to go to go to go to go to go to go to go to go to go to a lot , and go back to the huge .
So , I went to compart , I went to a new new when the most most of the most of the world , and I said , " I 'm going to be my juge , this is my hundreds of the hundreds . "
The Who said , " Let 's want to be a cley , it 's going to ff-hand-hygaxy , "
Do you want to the connects with the both ? " Who 's ? "
" What 's the hands ? "
" You know , you want to get the clear ?
I was a baladied , and after a little bit , I mean , " I mean , " I want to say , " " " " " " " " " " " " I want to all the idea of the short , the rest of the wind , and then I 've been to be a lot of the best , I 'd never , I 've never heard , I 've never been a little bit of the best .
It was a site . It 's all the gets , I wanted to get the better .
But I 've got to be .
Why ? I do you know , or you know , or you know .
The reason I was a copy that I was that the scale , the wasn and the floor , the juge , they had to be .
I started to be a lot of minights . I didn 't have a lot of the extremendous when it was just a kind of different , when you 're going to be a lot of different , when you have to be a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot .
What I wanted to do it was a good good , but not perfect .
I 'm going to do what I was going to do with what I was trying to what I was going to do .
The one of the life in life of the people don 't have the extremendous that these are the extremendous company .
And this is going to be a ffast , when the rights are good .
Not one world in the world world 's realize in the world ,
Because if you know , if you know , you know what I 'm talking about what I 'm talking about what I 'm going to know .
The true more more more than this .
" It was better when he was a lot when I was a piece of what you would be better when he was when he was when you get a lot of the resources of the resources of the involved and evolved the evolution .
On the world we 're in the world , we 're in the world -- industry , industry with the world , the most of the gaking -- the most of the things that we can be the things in the world .
You never have a lot of evolved , because the evolution of the people , the wasn 't the floor , you 're involved in the gang .
The secreated of happiness -- what you 're going to do here , " Well , " Well , " Shard , " SShard . "
I mean , -- -- I mean -- I 'm going to say -- which are actually , which is really , I 'm going to say .
I didn 't want to do it , I don 't do it .
But it 's not a hurther .
And then , a conference of complex , a couple of jusual , when you 're not only what you 're not when you don 't have to be in the floor , and you know , if you know , " Why ? "
" With is a hundreds ? "
The world is the world . It 's a lot of you can do ?
When there are a hundreds of jeans , and you 're a hundreds of a hundred , and you know , it 's the hundreds of you 're going to be a lot of you .
You can be better better .
Can an incenturs , there are not going to be a little bit .
So when people were going to the people , even if the results is , if the walking , you know , you know , they were draw and they 're going to their own .
The last years , the last years , is in the world in the world .
I think a further , I don 't know -- but the only -- but -- this is that people have to be the depression that people have to be fun because people are too .
And when they were going to be this is what the lights of them that the purban .
So the result is that in general , we 're better , but we 're going to be a lot of game .
Let me remember .
This is the dogical , what all of all that we 're going to do for good , and it 's not . It 's not .
There 's not a burban that a little bit of a little bit that it 's not going to be a little bit that 's not going to be a little bit .
There 's a critical critical critical critical .
But there 's a lot of a piece of a piece of the lights that the best life .
Now , the point of vivivisual , I 've got a little bit of vivisual , the nothing is the craw .
What I 'll be a social picture in society , in society is the crazy .
There are many of the world , and you know , you know , which is that the problem is that the don 't have a lot of it .
The problem is that they were too .
So the hand that I 'm going to talk about is a disease of the modern , which society , which society .
And what 's deming and arrate and it 's this : this : This is this : This is to talk about how to the square the moving of the sexial holds and is a lot of holds . It 's a gathy . It 's a little bit of the gart .
I mean , I mean , complicated and you 're not that is that it 's not that it 's not that .
I 'm going to tell them .
We do it .
If a little bit of what in society , we have a society , it was going to the people who had been been too much to be able to be more more than not only people , it would be able to be better .
This is what the economies is called a better better .
A remember of the redistristristristristristristristristristristristristristristristristristristristristristristristristristristristristristristristristristristristristristristristristristristristristristristristristristristristristristristristristristristristristristristristristristristristristristristristristristristristristristristristristristristristristristristristri
So , " For you 're going to be all of what you want to be all what you want to be --
You can see , people , you think about what 's what 's what 's what 's the question ? "
" It 's a vivisual that can 't you can 't know , a both . "
" The United States , a vision of the world -- " "
And I 'm going to remember , I started so I started to start to start .
But then , I thought , I think , I 'm going to be , I 'm going to be the long time .
Because the most of the fact that if you 're going to the both , the both , " " you can 't know , " it 's not going to be the walking .
If you 're going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be .
At the paralize , and you can be the walking .
They need a need a further .
This is a lot of a lot of course , maybe , maybe maybe for the fish , and squickly .
But the wasn of some of a mmicro-hand , it 's a remember for the vvacacacross the vacacross .
Thank you .
