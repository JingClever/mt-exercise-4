The year I showed these slide demonstrate that the rate glacial race , which for almost three million years of the United States continental continental , it 's record of 48 percent .
But this subject the gravity of the problem because it doesn 't show the spector of the problem because it 's the spector of the ice .
The artics is , the artics is , in a sense , the baby of global climate system .
It 's exactly inverny and you get recognize .
The next slide is a run of the last 25 years ,
The ice of the ice , they were signed in red .
And as you see , you get up to the blue .
That 's the ice in the winter in the winter , which you get extremely .
You can see that the ice ice ice ice , five years or five years or more , or five years , is like the slooks like the site , which is like the site .
In 25 years , he went to this ,
This is a problem because the whole scale of the terrist of the terrist of the artical terms where there are huge of carbon congeld , the microbes that , they 're transformed in meter microbes .
I spect to the totality of the atmosfertic , the global warming , that amount could be , supert this point of the world 's returned out .
In some laghi , I can profound in Alaska meter is already rebulating from the water .
The professoresse Katey Walter of the University of Alaska , I recognize a bunch of the scorer .
Video : Wow ! Al Gore : Lake 's good .
A reason is that this termal extremely surprising Groenland from the northern Groenland from the northern Groenland from the northermer .
This is a figure out of the glacial fixing .
The brought it never had to reach similar .
This is the Kangerlussuaq , in the West of Groenland .
If you want to know how the sal level of the wild of the wild of the ice , you know , here 's where you reach it .
These corrents are increasing rapidly .
As the other part of the planet : Antarctttarttttars of the planet .
The month have been wild the scientists have dichise that the balance is in negative , and that the Antarcttarctttarctttops , which is particularly quickly , it 's particularly ,
Eval to six meters of the active account , like Groenland .
On Himalaya , the third biggest block , they see new laghes , which few years ago were gacier .
40 percent of the world population was going to be the water in the population of the world 's population .
Sulle Ande : this ice is the bottom of the water water .
The brought is increased .
But when it dimines , the same access to the water ,
In California , the newspaper of the Nevada is 40 percent .
The backkyes are in the crisis .
The predictions , like you read , I 'm graves .
The growth secity in the world leads to a car night .
The environmental disaster environmenting a ritm outside of normal and without precedently .
And so , in the last 30 years , you know , the early 30 years , you know ,
This is a beautiful beyond all .
If you look at the stories if you can see the consequences .
In the last five years , we add 70 million tons of CO2 , every 24 hours , 24 hours of tons in the oceans every day .
Look at the Pacific area of the Pacific area , and the American area , and both of the subcontinent , where there 's a mention the subcontinent , where there 's a radical impoor in the ocean .
The major causes the global warming , and the deforestation , which is 20 percent , is the use of combustiable .
The oil is a problem , and the carbon is even worse .
The United States are one of the two countries with the most emissions , together at China .
And it propond to build a lot of other middle .
But we 're at a change of direction .
These are the annative designs in the last years and some of the alternative versus of alternative versus .
And in the way , there 's a lot of politics in our country .
The carbon industries of oil and oil have spent 250 million dollars in the last year for promotion , which is a baby , which is a oxide .
I remember me to get me something --
I want to go Natal , in the Tennessee , where I have , there was a 3.8 billion liters of carbon dioxial scories .
Maybe you saw it on the news .
This is the biggest flow of scories in America .
It 's success around Natale .
The nature of the coal trade of one of the carbon was this .
Video : It 's the coal , it 's a kind of allegro and happy .
It 's abundant here in America , and it makes our economy .
Frosty the carbon is always more ,
It 's a good price , adorable , and the workers are thinking .
Al Gore : Da : Da part of the West Virginia .
The biggest society is Massey Coal . It 's Massey Coal .
Video : Don Blankenship : I 'm going to be .
Al Gore : So the Alleance for the Clima has launched two campaign .
This is a part of it , one part .
Video : Actor : ALergy see the climate change as a serious minactivity as a little mind in our business .
So , our priority is to invest a great amount of money in a force , in a force , and confused to public truth the truth of carbon .
Actually , the carbon is not sport .
We think it 's also -- it 's also a good profuse .
So , not preocupateves of climate change .
Let do do it .
Video : Actor : Carbone , you 've heard a lot of talk about .
So , I do do a game in a structure at the race of the baby , and it 's about the coal .
Straordinary ! The machines are a little bit , but this is the sound of the coal technology of carbon technology .
The carbon is between the main cause the global warming , but the global technology , but the technology of carbon dioxial , and the technology of carbon dioxial warming .
Doookay : this is the ownnine technology .
Al Gore : I finally , the alternative positive is connects to economic question and at the national security .
Video : Comition : America is in America is in the crisis , the national crisis .
The fidds that the colleages all : our dependence from combustiable , like the coal coal and oil oil and the importance of the important coal .
Now , there 's a new , car , car solution for using it .
Repower , 100 percent of the power , in 10 years .
A plan to put America to work , make sure , and make sure you get more , and help to stop the global warming .
And so , a solution that bails to solve our problems .
Repower .
Al Gore : This is the last .
Video : Comition : it 's to reach America .
One of the most fast ways to get us to the end of the dependence that are going to kill our planet .
It 's the future is here . It 's here . It 's here , just a new energy .
It turns out to be a few : Nooos investimate for a bought .
Coming : Repower . It 's time to be realistic .
Al Gore : A old hectors says , " If you want to go to the fast , you go from the money .
If you want to go away , you go together . "
We have to go away , speaks .
Thank you very much .
The year is going to TED fecame in the LHC .
And I promise to record you to get to how the machine works .
So , here I have a lot of the other time , there was no , the LHC is the biggest experiment ever , the great experiment .
His the complicated conditions that were less than a billion by the beginning of the universe -- until the beginning of the universe -- until 600 million times a second .
And that 's just environment .
This is the Ginevra in Ginevra .
We spray these mini-Big Big Bang inside the record .
This is what I work . It 's called ATLAS -- it 's 44 feet and has a 22 meters .
This is a spectacular picture of ATLAS in built , you can see the proportions .
10 tember the last year we have accesum , we have accesum to the first time .
And this picture was taken by ATLAS .
It 's because of immense ency in control .
It 's a picture of the first phasm of the first phasm of the LHC , both , both in collision , and spread in the LHC , and spread particles in the labs .
In other words , when we see that the 10 tember , we have to understand the car , we understand the machine , which is a great vicity .
I don 't know if it was this to make us more open , and then somebody went on Google and saw that the beginning was this .
And what it means that we had a cultural impact beyond that scientific .
I think , it was a week later , there was a problem with the machine , and they had to these dored drugs here -- these dored drugs .
These fields when the machine is 13,000 prining when the machine works at the power of power .
Now , the technicians between you 're going to look at the files and say , " It 's not true . "
And instead can do it because when they 're very cold of becoming out of the floor .
So , at least 271 degrees , at the inferior at the space between the stars , these files can bring that corrate .
In one of the juncle of the most namies in the LHC , there was a fell of fect-fell .
So , the falling record , and 13,000 prints , and 13,000 printices , they met a electricity .
This was the results .
Now , this is more impressive if you think that these magnetets more than 20 tons , and that you have been spoke about 30 centimeters .
They 're saying about 50 magnetes .
We had to take them , what we have done .
We repristined and encourages .
Now , they 're returning all the way .
I finally , the end of the LHC is is going to be again .
We 're going to accensive , and we expect to get data to right or lights , and then we 're going to be able to be the universe that are the morning that are the universe .
Now , of course , in a way , these cause , these accidents reaccess to the bad value of science and engineering in frontier . It 's easy to concentrate future .
I think the fact that the fact that it is so hard , I think it 's the limits , I think it 's this value of things like LHC .
I 'd like to conclude with the words of a scientist Inglens , Humprey Davy , which , in the inuseful experiments of his puplease , his publish , his pulay was very dangerous for the human mind , he said , " Nichael Faraday , he said , " Nichael , which is not how much much much much of science are definitable to be . "
Thank you .
I want to start ask you to ask you to rethink when , kids , you 're going to start to ask you ,
As you realive how to reach them and reach them , and then you get them and music , learning to think and resolving them , and to think of problems with relationships .
The reasoning is profound connected to the way we understand the way we understand the world around us .
So , as a whole information , by the use of our own own own own own physical interaction , and my conon Patts , and my collaborator , and my collaborator , I started asking me , I started asking me , " And if we use a computer , instead of the mouse like the digital mouse , and then we could make a short information with a desktop of the digital ,
And it 's like to our placiment ?
The question was so interesting that we decidemit , I built the answer , building the answer , and I built the Siftable .
In a few words , a Siftable , is a big computer interactive as a biggest .
In a few words , a Siftable , is a big computer interactive as a biggest .
You can move the hand , you can see the hand , you can see the movement and have a radio and a radio radio radio radio and a quote and a radio radio radio radio .
But it 's basically , I 'm physicistic , like the morning , you can just music .
Siftable is of a new ecosystem tools to manipular information .
And as they become more physicistic , consciously , of the other , and they become more physicists , and they become more physicists , of how we move , we can exploring new different .
I 'll start with a simple example .
This Siftable is configurned to show video : if you including it in a direction , the video raising , if you including it , in the back .
These ritrats interactive are consciously ,
If you 're interested in what it 's their own around .
If they 're circles , they 're looking at it , and they can get a little bit .
If they 're circles , they 're looking at it , and they can get a little bit .
They also have their movement and inclination .
And then we realized that one of the interesting implications of the interaction was the power of the data , for example , " a color like a liquid , " a liquid like a liquid .
In this case , we have three Siftable configurate like sites and I can use them to use them to the color in the color in that central , where you missing .
And I can use them to use them to the color in that central , where you mism .
If we have too , we can reput a little bit of it .
They also are beautiful possibilities of appreciate , like languages , and games of logic , where people can try to try to see things fast , and see the results the immediately , and you get the immediately immediately .
I 'm now --
This is a Fibonacks that I do with a equations of equations .
Here we have a words of words that is half of the midle and Boggle .
Pratically , at every turn , you get a letter to case on any Siftable , Pratically , at every turn , and while you 're trying to buy in any case , and while you 're trying to buying them to do it .
Then , after about 30 seconds , you remissing , and you have a new set of lectable and new possibility to try .
Thank you .
Here 's the children came to the Media Lab , I did it , and I made it and I turned a video .
They were very fleased very .
And one of the interesting things that you have to have a lot of application is that you don 't have to give you a lot of education .
And then , say , " What makes them , " and they know what to do .
Here 's how other people who try it .
This is our younger heads , there 's a hand on the right .
It actually wanted to impilate them .
They were only morning , for him .
Now , this is a complaining application .
We wanted to build a tool for the appearing of the languages .
It 's going to insert new characters in the scene , by by by the Siftable their associated .
It 's going to insert new characters in the scene , by by by the Siftable their associated .
So , it 's doing the sun .
Video : The sun is .
David Merrill : Now , he took a track in the scene .
Video : The treator .
By work ! Yes ! Yes ! Yes ! Yes ! Yes ! ! Yes !
So I school hood the Siftable and put up neighbors can make the characters of the characters ,
Video : Bau !
I can , inventing their story .
Video : Ciao !
DM : It 's a story with the end , and it can decide him how you svolge .
DM : It 's a story with the end , and it can decide him how you svolge .
Video : Volas ,
DM : The last example I have the last example that I have time to show you , is a tool , to fix and extended music .
It 's a tool , recently , to recently , to fix music and exectremely music .
Siftable here are across from the sound like base , basically and the bacteria .
Each one of these has four different variations , and you can choose .
And then you can enjoyonto the sound of the sound to be in your pleasure .
And it 's just just making a sound of a suund " and a sequence . "
These are actually that you can control from vive , like the reverbs and the phild .
I attacks to a particular sound and then including it .
And then there are the general effects like time and you want , and you applicate the whole sequence .
Let 's look at how it works .
Video : DM : We 're going to put a base in two Siftable , " sequence , " We 're in a series , we add the other base .
Now , I put a line of the basis .
Video : DM : Now , I add of percussions --
Video : And I 'm going to put the bacteria , so I can control the effect of the effect of view .
DM : DM : I can run the whole sequence of inclinking the entire sequence of a late laby or from one late .
Video : And I 'm going to add the blow to the blow to give more expression .
Video : I can recombine the sequence . "
So I don 't have to plan first , but I can improvement , it 's longer or more cord .
And now , finally , I can get the whole sequence to inclinking to the left Siftable . "
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is built new interface , and more sounds like our brain work work and more sounds like our brain and corporate .
And today , I had time to show you one of the results of this performance , and also some possibility that we try to take out of the lab .
The concept that I want to get you to get this new generation of the generation of designed , to interact with digital media , which will bring information in our world in the way we want .
Thank you very much .
I don 't see the hour to talk with all of you .
I 'm a writing .
I think of the books is my profession , but it 's more than this , of course .
It 's also the love and the love of my life .
And I don 't expect that I can 't expect .
But , said , something particular happened in my life and my life , and my career , and my career , which taken me to recognize the whole recently realibring with this job .
And the particular thing I 'm going to write this book , this book , this biography called Manogy , Prega , " which , diversally from my precedently , for some reason , for some reason , and it becomes a great , sensatisitive , became , and it 's a great , sensatisitive , became a whole , very whole thing called a whole thing , very nice .
And the result is that everywhere now , people are treat me like if I were condanned .
Davily -- condanned ,
They 're going to me to all worried and say , " Don 't you get to do it better than do it ?
Don 't you get to write for all life without power to be able to be able to create a book that can important book ? "
that can important somebody ? "
It 's rashing , you know .
But it could go , part of that I remember that more than 20 years ago , when I begin to say , I was a adolescent -- I wanted to be a writing writing .
I went to met the same reaction of the same reaction .
And people say , " Don 't have succeful ?
Don 't you know , the humiliation of killed you ?
Don 't you know , you know , to be able to be able to be outside and die on a heart of the sogets of drugs , and to die on a ball of the way to be in the movement of falliment ? "
Cose so , you know .
The answer -- the short answer to all these questions is , " Yes . "
Yes , I 've been a lot of all those things .
I 've been always had a purpose .
And I also also have a lot of other things that people could not have to be able to be .
As the algaxight-others .
But , how do I think about what I thought and I was going to ask me , and I was going to ask me , why ?
It 's rational ?
It 's logic that anyone who has to be spectacing for a job that you 've been born to do .
But what 's there is a particular in the impress creative to make us nervous about health , and the same way that other caring do not ?
How my father , for example , he was a chemistry and I don 't remember in his 40 years of activity in the livity where he was asked if she had a couple ?
It was never -- that block of the John , how do it ?
Don 't work that it works ?
Onestically , the cheers engineers like a group , they don 't certainly , in the secos of being alcolized by being high hath .
We writers , we have enough , and not just writers , and not just writers , but creative to be huge , we have this reputting of being huge instable to be huge .
And it 's not another you to look at the sad of the magnificent of the magnificent creative , just in the venture , just die , they died young and often them .
And also the ones that they don 't have been suicipate to be really disdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdised by their dons .
Norman Mailer , first of die , in the last interview , he said , " Ogn my book has been a little more . " A straining a little bit more fashion work .
But we don 't bad bad at the end , because we 've heard these things , so we 've been completely interified and accepted the notion that creativity and the offering , and the offering is in some way you read , and the art , at the end , in the end , will be a few way , in the end , in the end , in the end , in the end , in the end , it will be a way .
And the question I want to take all of here today is : you 're accord with this idea ?
It 's good this thing -- because it 's also watch a himeter behind me , it 's not good for anything .
I think it 's odioxide .
And I think it 's also dangerous and I don 't want to see the perpetuated in the next century .
I think it 's better to encourage our big creative minds .
And I think I 'm sure , in my case -- it would be very dangerous to start fire out to see the sense of the supposition , subtelling the circumstances in which I 'm in my career .
It 's actually -- you know , I 'm quite young , I 'm just young , I 'm just like , 40 years .
I still have about four decades work in me .
And it 's very likely that any thing I write about now , then it 's going to be right from the world as the work that was going to be able to the last success of my last book .
I 'm going to be slavery , because we are all more or friends here -- it 's likely to my hospaper .
Oh , Gesus , who thought !
You know this is the gender thinking that leads a person to start to start to get a person to start to get a person and I don 't want to do it .
I would keep to continue to continue this job that we love .
So , the question is , how do it , how ?
And so it looks like , after many reflection , which the way to work to continue to write is to be a psychological costrutter , OK ?
I had a few way to find a safety of the safety of me , and my natural anxide that reaction will be able to get it . And as I was trying to get it . And as I was trying to look at the time , trying to see if other society to see if you could have some of the best ideas and more seanxide .
about how to help people make make the inerents of creative people to make the creativity of creativity .
And that research me taken to the Great and antician .
I 'm going to do it because it was in certain and then back .
In the amazing Great and the antics of the people don 't seem to believe that creativity came to the men , OK ?
And he thought the creativity was this spirit about the divine and that came to be , and that would be if men by a few source and soubt , for reasons , and unknown .
They call these divins spirits about creativity of creativity . "
Socrate , wonderful , credemon the wisdom goes from the landwisdom .
The Rooomanist was the same idea , but they call that kind of spirit a genius .
which is great , because the Romanime , because the Romanium was somebody particularly intelligent was somebody particularly intelligent .
They have to be a genius was this kind of entity , which has been lived in the murs of a artist , a little bit like the elfter of a nearticle , and that would come out of the work of the work of the work of the work of artist , and model the results of that work .
It 's a deal -- that 's the distance of which I talk about -- that is the psychological psychological that you 're going to protect from your work .
And everybody knew that was so that it was , right ?
So , the articks were protected by things , like , as a too narcial , how do we have , no ?
If your work was except , it was exceptional , all of the way , everybody knew that they were helped by this genius .
If your work , it was not all your work , it was not all your job , right ?
They all know that was the your genius to be a huge .
And so people han concept the creativity in Occycle for a long time .
And then the Rinascient came and everything , and nacks this big idea ; we put this big idea ; we put the human to the human universe , and the middings and misters and more to make a creatures that wrote from divinity .
This was the major of humanesimum and people started thinking about that creativity came to think that the creativity came to completely by the ishared .
And for the first time in the history , you start to referring this or like a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of genius .
And I have to say , I think it was a big herror .
I think that allow somebody , a simple person to be like a recipient of being like a recipient , and the kind of the source of all the misters , creative , inosconogists , inosconcercial , a lot of humans .
It 's like to ask somebody to ingoes to get the sun .
Deform and distores completely the ego and creates all of these inestible expectable on the performance .
And I think it 's been this pression to destroyed the artists in the past of the past of the past of the past of the articles .
And if this is true , and I think it 's the question , and now , and now ?
Can we do it different ?
Maybe back to a more more , understanding of the relationship between humans and mistery .
Or maybe no .
Maybe we can 't have 500 years of rational thinking in a 18 minutes .
And there 's probably people in the audience that would be able to laity-suspectical knowledge , the notion of the nition , they following their projects .
Probably not convince you all about this .
But the question I want to take it is -- why not ?
Why don 't think about this way ?
Because it 's more than any sense of what has ever heard to explain the exasperts of the process of creative process .
A process that , as anyone who has ever been doing something -- so , so , it 's not to be a lot of it -- it doesn 't know , you know , it doesn 't recognize .
And , in fact , it can sometimes look at paranormal .
I did this met recently with the extraordinary poetesse , Ruth Stone , who 's been a few years , but it was a few few years , and he said that during his childhood in the rural Virginia , working out in the fields , and he welling it , and he was in the poetched by the landscape .
He said he was like a little bit of the air .
And he was rotolating to her from the landscape .
He felt it came to it , because he was so much as you get the earth .
He knew to have a solid thing to do at that point and it was , " course , " You know , " " You know how a matter . "
And then he goes to home and come up from this poety , and it would not have to make a piece of card and a mathemath and a mathemath and a mathemath , and he gets the page .
And so , I couldn 't be fast enough , so correct , so correct goes and record out of the roten rocket through and he would keep up through the landscapes and it would continue to a car , trying to be , as he said , " one else . "
And then there was the time -- this piece of the way I will never get it -- there was a lot of moments where it was almost losing , OK ?
So , he was ring up at home and he was trying to the card and the poetry , and he was a very , and he was a walking in the way , and then he said , " It was like , and then he said , he said , " It was like you , and the wind .
He was the popular poeted by and reput it in his body and turned into his body and turned out to page .
And in these cases , the poetic poem , it would be like the perfect , but at the last word at the first word .
So when I thought , I 'm thinking about -- it 's a crazy , it 's exactly the creative process .
I don 't have my creative process -- I 'm not a condition .
I 'm a music , and my way to work is ; you know , you know , at the same orary every day and get to work and get us and pass to work and get us to coffee .
But even I even even , in my head , I had a shared , I met that , sometimes .
And I imagine that a lot of you have the han done .
You know , even if the work and ideas were drive me from a certain of a certain source you can 't know .
What is this thing ?
And how can we relationships to extremely , but , I , rather , but , rather , that do you do it ?
And how I look at me , the best example of the best , I have the Maits , which I 've been interview , which I interview it a different day .
We were talking about this , and you know , Tom , for most of life has been the incarnation of the articks , and trying to contemporary , trying to control these species of impulse creative , dominate these species of intotally interized .
But then invected , he walked , and he was driving on a autostrada at Los Angeles , changed it .
He was going to go fast and all of a tract of this little framment of melodia , which is going to be the inspiring , and the challenging , and the telling , you know , it 's wonderful , and he wills , but it 's not like it .
It 's not a piece of card , not have a piece of card , it 's not a piece of paper .
So , he starts to feel this kind of old , and then , I 'm going to lose , and I 'm going to lose , and I 'll be obsessional from this slexioned .
I 'm not enough and I can 't do it . "
And instead of go in the panic , you stop .
I 'm going to put the whole process of mental process and made something new .
I 'm just looking at the sky and said , " You know , " Do you see that I 'm driving ? "
" Does it seems to write a song ?
If you really want to be , you get back to a more opports when I can get care of you .
Otherwise , you go to important to a lot of it today .
You 're going to disturba Leonard Cohen . "
And his process process , he changed after this .
I don 't work , the work was still dark as well as I always .
But the process , and the weightful was reef , when he took the genius , the genius that was out of him out of the other problems and liberated it , and he remaining it , and I remaining it .
but it welling this peculiar , wonderful bizarre collaboration between Tom and this strange and this strange and that strange that allows it was not Tom .
So how I feel that story that I was going to change a little bit of the way I work and already me once .
This idea , I walk up when I was wrote " Manogy , Prega , and cadds in one of those cave cave , and cadds in one of the disperation where we 're working on something and we can 't start thinking that it 's going to think that it 's going to be a book , which is going to be wrote .
Not just bad , just the worst books .
And I started thinking about the gait .
But then I remember to the Tom that I talk about the air and try to be .
So I throw my face face in the manicooking and dresses my hard to a vacuum .
And I said , " Sent , " Sent , what 's both , you know if this book is not going to be a burn 't be interactly to my , not be a burn ?
Because as I see I 'm going to put everything I , I don 't have more than this .
So if you want you to be better , you have to have to do your part .
OK . But if you don 't do it , you know , I don 't do it .
I 'll try to write the same because it 's my work .
And I want to do it for phavor that I have been presented to do my part of the way , " because -- at the end is so , OK -- sitting in the North of the North Please , and sacross the key to the clear of the slady , and musical musical music that they were going to get on the hours and hours to the ball .
And they were always magnific , because the balleras , and they were wonderful and they were wonderful .
But every long , rarely , something happened , and one of these artists become actually transcent .
And I know what I talk about , because I know you 've got all seen , at a point , a lost so .
It was like the time , you stop , and the balloon , and the ballows through a kind of a kind of a kind of different from the sun , like 1,000 , but it was all over .
And at the improvise not appeared , like a human human .
But it turns out to the divinity and under the wood of the divinity .
And when this is going to happen , you know , the people know what it was , they called the cool .
They were congone hands and and began to cancer , " Allah , Allah , Allah , God . "
That 's God , you know .
Curios nice nice . When the More invasered the South , the South , the sound of the South , and the pronto change in the secos of " Allah , " Olay , " Olay , " " " Os , " which you can hear in the corrids or in the famees .
In Spay , when a arten did something impossible and magic , " Allah , " Allah , " Allah , " I was , " I 'm going to understand , " I 'm a God .
And it 's great because we need .
But , the problem is the one day after , for the balloon the same , when you see and discover that I 'm 11 of Marteds and said , " You know , there 's no more .
It 's just a mortal with mortal gran with the ginoccurs , and maybe it will never be listing to that altzy .
And maybe anybody will have the God 's name of God still , and what 's going to do with the rest of his life ?
It 's hard .
This is one of the most pain that is a more pain to do in a creative life .
But perhaps not have to be so angoes to be so angoes , if you can 't believe , the most extraordinary , which is the most extraordinary of your own being being from you .
But you know , it 's just that you have data in the prestyard of this squisity of your life that you have to get to someone else , you know , you know , when you finished .
And , you know , if we think about this way .
And so I started thinking , and it 's sure , and it 's certainly like I thought for different months , during the book that I 'm going to publishing , the periood , spent , exism , I 'm going to follow my great success .
And what I have to continue to tell me when I feel electric , I feel this is , not have no laptop .
It 's not going to go . It 's just your work .
It 's a presentation to introduce your part , any of the way , any of it can be .
If your work is balance , balance , balance .
If the divine , assurgery , you know , you know , you know , you know , a few kind of wonderful , for one moment through your sforced , then " Or ! "
Otherwise , you do the same tudirectly .
And " Ole ! "
I think I think you have to teach it .
" Ole ! " You know , even for the same , even for humans and head , tal tal to make you continue to keep you to keep the continually .
Thank you .
Thank you .
June Cohen : Ole !
And as you know , I talked about some of some of these designs , human can , what can meaning and discovery of new genes .
Now , we 're starting a new way : we started digitalize biology and now , and now to start to start in a new fascinating of biology , we 're both in a new fascinating biology , design and synthesizing life .
We 've always been trying to downers .
" What is life ? " It 's something that many biologists I think they have tented to understand vary livels .
We tried different approviding to the terms , reduce the terms .
We 're digitalizing from almost 20 years .
When we sequenced the human genome , they were treating the analogical world of the digital world of the digital world .
Now , we ask , we can regenerate life , or create new life from this digital ?
This is the map of a small organism , the Mycoplasma genitalium , which is the small species of the small genome that can autorem in the laboratory .
And we tried to reduce the ulteriormind the genome to make a little bit more small .
We 're able to eliminate a high high of the genes of about 500 that are here .
But when we go to the eyed to his maps , it 's relatively simple answer to our .
I think , this is simple .
But when we look at all the genes that we can eliminate , one of the time , it 's very improbrought to a living cells .
So we decided that the only to provide was synthesize this croromosom in a way to be able to be able to get some of these fundamental questions .
And so we started the " Pooh , we can synthesize a cromosom ? "
It 's the chemistry context of these big molecules that we 've never been able to make it before ?
And , in case , can we make a cromosom , can make a cromosom ?
A croromosom is just a piece of chemistry of chemile .
The speakening that we are able to digitalize life is growing to exponential exponential exponential .
Our ability to write the genetic code , instead , and it 's pretty much much , but it 's better .
And our most recent rerecent results the exponential curve .
We 've been involved over 15 years ago .
The process process has require a lot of bioetics , beginning with a biothics before we start the early experiments .
But we found that that the DNA is very hard .
There are thousands of the world that make small segments of DNA , of the longest section of 30 to 50 to 50 to 50 to 50 to lectable , and it 's a degenerative process is longer , there are .
So , we had to develop a new metodo this , and correct these frments and correct the herrors .
And this was our first tentative , to start to start to digital information of the genome of Phi X 174 .
It 's a little virus that kills .
We designed the frments , the correction of the correction of the errors and get a molecule of DNA , about 5,000 lectable .
The interesting part is when we took this piece of chemistry , and we put it in the bacteria , and we inserious in the bacteria , and then we started to read this genetic code and produced the viral particles .
The viral particles are require cell , they 're back back to the cell , and they have been back and distrutter the Ecocles .
I talked about recent with the oil industry , oil membrals that they have certainly compress that they have certainly compress .
They remember .
We believe that this is a situation where the software can actually build the same hardware in a biological system .
But we wanted to do the biggest things in the larger .
We wanted to build the whole cromosom of the bacterium .
I 'm more than 580 miles of the genetic code .
So we thought we 've thought about the seven of the virus , so that we could change the cassal cassed to understand what the components are the components of a living cells .
The design is crucial , and if we start with digital information , and if we start with digital information , these must be very accurate .
When we sequencing this genome for the first time in 1995 , the accurate was a herror for every 10 miles .
We found , resequency , 30 herrors . If we had been used to be able to be able to do it .
A part of the process is designing segment , in the way that you can subvision that they have to have a little bit more than 50 lectiny to build subctually , they work together .
We 're going to do the only one here .
You know , you know , you know , we 're going to do the floor .
Think of this : we have a genetic code on four , and Take , and Tome .
Three of those lectures put together with about 20 lots , and there 's a specific order to the lectest lectors to the lectable for every amount .
So we can use genetic code to write words , framework , framework , depensil .
What we did we do with the beginning was self-doing .
Some of the fact that it was not a few .
We designed these segments to just just to be just to only only to be a containly only with it .
There are them to get them and put them and put them .
And we started assemble to assemble parts , beginning with segments , and then , to make a segment to form segments of 24 mile , and then to get to them to get to 72 mile .
And we have these sequenced in abundance so that we 're trying to make a very powering process to create a very very good stuff -- like you 'll see in a minute .
We 're trying to automatize the process .
So , this looks like the tabellon the tabellon the tabellon .
When we get to these very long , much longer segments , more than 100 miles , they 're not going to grow more directly in Ecoli .
You get to the limit of modern the toolally modern biology .
So we 've been considered other mechanisms .
We approvide another mechanism called recombination , which in biological biological , which is using the DNA to be able to repair the segment .
Here 's a example .
This organism , called Deinococcus , it can assorbed , can assorbing three million rad .
You can see in the summer as his cromosome like his cromosom .
In 12 -- 24 hours is reassembled exactly how it was before .
They were thousands of organisms that are able to do it .
These organisms can be completely secate .
They can live under vacuum .
I 'm absolutely certain life in space , and you know , and you know , to find new environments of water .
And in fact , the NASA has shown that this is .
This is a picture of the molecule that we built , just using these processes , just using these processes with the segment of the segment of the segment of the segment of the molecule that we 've built .
The light-assemble ,
This image was not wait with a microscope , but with a microscope , but with a microscope .
It 's a lot of a lot of the great microscope that we can see it with a microscope .
These are pictures that they cover a period of about six seconds .
This is the public advertising we made time ago .
I 'm more than 580,000 lectops of genetic code .
It 's the largest molecule of a definitely definitely created by man .
It 's a lot of a lot of sumer ,
If we stammal with a career 10 without spaces , you 'd like 142 pages , they would like 142 page .
Now , how do we do it work ? How do we do it ?
Of course , trade a virus is a game of girls .
It 's a little bit more complicated when they use bacteria .
It 's also simplest when it 's the ekarios like our : you can just extractly the nucleo and inserious inseration .
In the bacterium battery , the cell cell , but we have recently instead of the cell , but we have recently demonstrate that we are able to do a transplant of a cell cell .
We can refected a cromosom , and then we can get a microbial species .
The two different as men are as a different as men from the ops .
We add a few gene in more way to decide which you have to choose for this cromosom .
And then the sciolder , then the sciolder way to kill all the protein .
And when we put it in the cell was study -- and appreciate our graph , and our graph sophisticatos -- the new cell cell .
And we thought we could not go out , but we 've tried to be more in the way .
This is one of the major mechanisms of evolution .
We found that many of a lot of a third , or a third a second or a third hundreds of a thousands of tracks to that species .
So who think about the evolution as a gene at the time you can 't realized fashion of biology .
They are the initizens called the restription of the restription that they 're going to be digm .
The croromosom that was in the cells .
The mobile phone that we have inserit-crorop that we have inserit-h-cell crop .
It 's expressed , and has recognized the other cromosom as a material , and it 's masticated , and we 're returned with only the cell and the new cell cell and the new cell cell .
It became blue because of the genes we have inserious .
And in a short least time , all the carterists of a kind of a kind of further , and it 's transformed in a new species , based on the new software , based in the cell .
All the proteins are changed , the membraning , and when we read the genetic code of the exactly of what we have transfer .
Now , this could seem alchemy genetic , but altering the software , but it 's going to change things in a enough sustained enough .
Now , I already explain that here is not talking about genesis , but of progress to start with the three million years and a half of evolution , and I said that maybe we 're going to create a new version of the Cambrian where they will be a new species on this digital process .
Why do that ?
I think it 's enough obvious when we think about our need .
We 're going to go from six billion and a half billion people in the next 40 years .
Right for example , I was born in 1946 .
Now , there are three people on the planet for each one , in 40 years , in 40 years , they will be four .
We 're having problems to find out food , fresh water and pull , and welling , and wells and a half billion people .
It 's going to be more to do it for nine billion .
We use more than five billion , more than 30 billion , more than 30 billion baries of oil .
That means millions of baries a day .
When we try to find biologic processes , or any kind of process to rempizing them , it 's going to be a huge huge .
And we have to keep all the way of CO2 of these things that finishing in the atmosphere .
Al day , thank you to know , thank you to scientific discovery , and I like to think that are the components with about 20 million genes , and I like to think they are the components for the future .
The electronic industry , just a dozen about components , and think about how many different things are coming out .
Our limits here are the limits here are biological reality and our imagination .
Now , we have techniques , thank you to do these metods of synththrow , in fact , we can do this genomics combined .
We 're able to build a big robot that can produce a big robot that can produce a million cromosomes at a day .
Think of the processing these 20 million different different , or to try to get optimize the processes to produce either or or drugs , new vaccines , and create more biology , and create more biology , and create more biology , and create more biology , and create more biology .
And it 's just a standard selection .
We can choose to be living for a result of survive , or carbon , and chemistry , production of the etc .
This is a few of some software programmed to have a lot of seeds that we 're working for able to be able to be able to sat the computer .
Well , we don 't know how they will be .
We know exactly what it is their genetic code .
Now , we 're concentrating the cooking of the generation of generation .
You also saw you see that it 's a finished extended by the way .
We have more than the second second , and third generation that will be surrounds of the most of the higher value of the higher value , or different kinds of butanol .
But the only way the only way biology can have a great impact without increasing more than the cost of food and limitate the dispone-to-reform the CO2 in matter , which we 're working for the CO2 in matter , which we 're working on the way , and we think , and we think of it , and we think of power in how many generation in how we 're going to be able to do this .
The sunlight solar light -- and the CO2 is a metodown-odow , but in our world , we found different metods .
This is a organism that we have described in 1996 .
It 's in the ocean profound , about 2500 feet of the temperature of the water .
They recognize the CO2 using hydrogen molecular energy .
We 're trying to understand if we can incancer CO2 , which can be translated by the CO2 , which can be translated with that CO2 in carbon , to drive this process .
So , we think we could think we could be able to increasing what the question of the base of what is life is Noh , " which is Noh , vertising the goal of record to record the interest industry .
Exactly . If you can 't do it from TED , where can you can 't do it from TED , where can you ?
It would be a main the source of energy .
And so we 're working for using the same metods to create vaccines .
You 've seen this year with the influence , we 're always back to a year and with a dollar when it 's a dollar when it 's going to find the right .
I think that that that you can change by combines in combines .
That 's how the future could start seeing , now , the tree of evolution , accelling the evolution of evolution , accelling the evolution of synthetic , and inally initial cell .
We 're so so as a lot of the people .
Our discovery is to be able to live enough to try to make it . Thank you very much . Thank you very much .
I can see you , the most rapidly possible , some fundamental work , some fundamental work , which we 've taken to the Microsoft in the following year ago . This is Seadragon .
It 's a huge environment that you can interact is to the local level that remote with a huge amount of data .
Here we 're seeing a lot of digital photos with a kind of photos and continue , for a quickly , and then , for a quickly , disponing the images like .
And it doesn 't matter how big is the amount of information that we see , how much these are great collecting , or the images of data or data or the images .
Most of the photographs , but this for example , but this for example is a scansion of the Congress , and require from the Congress , and require in the middle of 300 megap .
It 's not a difference because the only thing that limit the prestations of a system like this is the number of plug on your screen in any time . It 's also a very flexible architecture .
This is a book , example of data , not images .
This is the Dickens of Dickens . Ogn . Ogn represents a capitable .
To show you that it 's just about the textbook , and not images , we can do a thing about that , to make a real representation of the rest , not a phototally .
It could be a little artificial way to read a book to read a book .
It 's not to be advice .
This is a more realistic . It 's a number of the Wardian .
Every picture is the beginning of a section .
And there really really the pleasure and the beautiful experience to read the version of a quotidian or a quotidian , which is for nature a lot of a half a kind of half a kind of half a kind of half .
We also did something with the corner of this particular number of the Guardian .
We created a fasules to alter resolutionary , much more than what you use in a normal public advertising -- and we 've inserious about the content .
If you want to see the carterists of this automobile , you can see here .
Or other models , or even the specific techniques .
And this really shows some of these ideas to eliminate the limits of space on the screen .
I love that this means that this means you get to end the end , and other pop-up , and the similar pop-up , they don 't have to be necessary .
Of course , the map of the map applications of the most obvious applications for this kind of technology .
And on this , I don 't want to lose time , if we don 't have contributed to do this field .
These are all the streets in the United States , you know , the NASA .
So , we 're going to be at something else .
This is actually actually from the view of the Web ; you can go to see it .
It 's a project called Photosynth , which combine two different technologies .
A Seadragon and the other is a visual research to the computer very interesting research from Noah Snavel , student of Washington , with the U.Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve . UW : " U.S. . . . " A hottim .
And it 's from the view , gesture from Seadragon .
You can see it when we do this kind of screen , where we can get from a picture and have this kind of experience and have this kind of experience to resolution .
But the space space of the space space here has actually actually a meaning .
The algorithms of visualization of the computer have register , in order to the recorresponding to the recorresponding to the record to the record , and all of them . And then you see the Rococcurred , and they 're woccurred . So , you know , you know , the elements of a s-stable s-stable . And these things are all the colleagne .
I don 't know if I 've been showing you some other environment .
There are some more space space .
I want to spend a lot of the original data of Noahhahs -- and this is from a prototype of Phototype of Photosynth , that we 've done it , to show you what I think is really the clear that I 'm really the clear behind this technology , the technology , the technology Photosynth . And it 's not necessary .
We had to worry about the laws and forth and forth and forth .
This is a rebuild the Notre catthedral catthedral Cray . Bast Flickr , in Flickr , and you get images of the types of the standing , other camps and so on . Or , and so on . Oone of these arancies , and I think . Oone of these arcies that you have discovery .
So , I 'm all all pictures from Flickr and they were all all the way to be in this way .
And it 's possible to navigate this way simply simply .
You know , I never thought I 'd never think about it to work for Microsoft .
It 's very gratifying this kind of accook-up here .
I think you can see that that it 's a lot of different types of different field , from those phones to the phones , in the professional , a number of meaningful , they 're together in this environment .
And if I retest , I try to try to look for those strange .
A lot of it 's eases , etc .
And somewhere here 's a number of photograph , and that 's a number of photograph -- that .
This is a poster of Notre Dame register .
We can go from the poster to the physics of this environment .
The essential point is that we can do with social environment . This is ready ready ready to be on the entire of the entire memory of how to appear the land , from visual visual , and college all those data together .
All those pictures become , more than the som of the som of parts .
You have a model of the earth that emerging .
Think about this as a such like Stephen Lawler 's work on Earth . War .
It 's something that grow up in complexity , and the people use , and the way that you use for the use of the car to the use .
Their photos are huses with the other people .
If somebody is the idea of the idea of all these saying , my photos , my photos of Notre Dame improvisely , you know , you know , how to get all these data , and I can use how to use it , and I can use the kind of a kind of a cross-motion , using photos of anybody else , and have a cross-motion of cross-moke cross-mos-mo----mos-like cross-mooth .
Of course , a consequence of all this is virtual model of any interesting elaborate , in the earth , collected , and you 're not just to achieve image and similar , but from the midddd-dead , but the memory ,
Mille thank you .
Chris Anderson : I realized ? What your software in the next few people to do is that in the next few years , in the next years , all the photographs , all the photograph , they 're going to be collected together ?
BAA : Yeah . What 's doing is basically discover .
It 's creating hyperlinks , if you want , you know , between images .
And it 's doing it in the base of images .
The thing becomes very interesting if you think about the recognize of the information that many of these images .
As when you make a research of images on the Web , you digit on the web , and the textbook about the picture of the pictures of the pictures of the pictures .
Now , what if you have that photos all your photos ?
So the amount of interconnection , and the amount of interconnection and the amount of recognize that is really huge . It 's a classic effect of the network .
CA : Blaise , it 's really incredible .
BAA : Vringrational .
One of the main pipal plackage when you travel and one of the ethnographics is the power of the power of who have not forget the antis of the traditions , between who have the past , the touch in the flower , the wind , the ployes in the floor .
And I think that scientists Jaguar travel , even the Via Lattea , or that the makes the Inuit , or who are still colms of the Dharm , or Himalayas , the good degree , to remember the important way , to remember the most central anthods , to remember the most important way we live in any sense , but it 's just a sense of it , but it 's just a model of fact ,
the consequence of a particular set of adaptops that our stroyed , or mal , many generations ago .
And , of course , we all share of the essential trats .
We all have . We all have .
We 're subjects to record .
We have to fall the inesorability of morte , so it doesn 't surprise if we cancer and balket --
We all have a art .
What is the particular thing is the particular rhythm , the rate of the dance of every culture .
It doesn 't matter that they are the thinking of the Borneo , or the following of the Haiti , or the Haiti , or the wrote of the Kaisut in Kaisut in Kaisut in Kaisut in Kaisut , or a wodd .
He was my company in the journey of journey in the desert of the high of the hyak , in the Everest , the mother of the world .
All these populations teachers are others of thinking , there are other ways of thinking , other ways of moving moving in the world .
And , if you reflect a second , it 's a concept that can give you hope .
And together , the miriades of the world creating a rager of the world creating a spiritual life and cultual , that 's important for the planet and it 's important for the planet , like a biological ragela .
And you can think about this cultural raging as a cultural ethnosfhere and you can call the som of the total som of all the concepts , inspiring , ideas , inspiring , inspiring , intuition , intuition , the human knowledge of the consciousness of the consciousness of the consciousness of the consciousness of the consciousness of the consciously knowledge ,
The etnosfhere is the great patrimonium of human .
It 's the symble of what we are and what we can be in how much species .
And because the biosphere was free consumed by the beautiful , it 's happened to the etnosfhere and much much more rapidly .
Nothing , for example , it would say that 50 percent of all species , it would say , " It 's been on the orem of the extinction because it 's falmost , or more apocalyththesis -- and not even close to the most of biological different .
The indicticks all of that is , of course , the language .
When you were born 6,000 languages on this planet .
A language is not just by a vocabolary or from a gaxial , or a series of rules .
A language is the sprain the human spirit .
It 's the middle of which animal is record in the material world .
Every language is a forest of mind , a background , a way of the spiritual system .
And of those 6,000 languages , as we 're sitting in Monterey , at least half of the children is not more supply in the orectors .
They don 't get more teacher , which means , the less you want to say , at less you , which are already dead .
What 's the more triles of being fly from the silence , the last me of being the last to talk , of the last to be the sages of the things , and the ancipath of the kids ?
This is report , it 's the state of someone in the world every two weeks , two weeks , a moment and a motor , and a motor of a very ancient .
And I know somebody to say , " Is it not it ?
The world would not be a better place if we talk all the same language ? " Benism , then we talk to all yorba .
Let 's talk kills .
You 're going to be a tract thing to say , not to talk about language .
I 'd like to do a trip through the etnosfhere through the etnosfhere .
a little journey in the etnosfhere for what we are lost .
Many of us forget that when I say , " different ways of existing existing existing different ways of existing existing .
We take for example this baby Barasana , in Amazon , the sector , the popular bony , which creds to the middle of the lats of the lats of the lats of the sand-up sacres .
It 's a popular popular popular , the blue color because the blue is identify in the time of the forest , which is identified in the forest , which depends the popular popular .
They have a strange language and a mathematrimonial , detect , " " " You have to have a different language . " You have to talk about a different language .
This is that radical in the past mitological past , but the particularity is that in these family where you 're talking about six or seven language , because of matrimons of matrimons .
They limited to listen and then start to talk about .
We take one of the most interesting tribes that I lived , the Waorani , Waorani , the Waorld Ecuador a popular populous popular that has been in 1958 .
In 1957 , five missionary missionary they have a herror .
They did choices that they were record that they were rrhythrow them , forest that they were recognizing that this popular popular popular , he had never seen anything .
They have collected the picture of the land , they turned to the research of a form , and , not find nothing , they have been concluded that they would attled the distry , and they killed the five missionary with the lance .
But Waorans don 't just killed the straniestery .
They killed with them between them .
54 percent of the mortality was caused to them .
We 're sitting at eight generations and we found two death of morte , and when we were sitting , they have a lot of them that one of them was invected , and then they killed the same . And then they killed the same .
The clackers were able to recognize the animal from 40 pass and recognize the species .
In the early years , ' 80s , I was assigned a really interesting complex when my Harvard , I asked me if I wanted to go to Haiti in the secret of the power of Duvalier and the Tacoe of the power of Duvalier and the impossesses me to do the zombie .
To give a sense of my sense , I should have to understand the Codow , and Vodoor is not magnect .
It 's quite a complex metaphysical complex metaphysical view of the world .
A lot of interesting .
If I ask you to ask me me me the big religions of the world , what would you say ?
Cristianesimum , Islam , Buddism , Ebraism , etc .
A continent is always left out , thinking that the Africa is not a lot of religious , and they did not religious religious . And instead of these religious concepts of these religious concepts of these religious concepts of these religious concepts .
What makes the voodoor is the intense is the intense of life and dead .
So , you 're going to get the spirits .
The spirits can be invest by Great Acqua , they respond to the rate of the dance of the dance of the vive viously in the way that for a short of the way that for a short , it becomes the cool .
So , the voodowners love to say , " You know , " You know , " You know , " You know , " You know ,
We say , " Let 's go to the temple and divention . "
And from the moment that you can , it 's the spirit that you can do the mal , how can you do the mal ?
So you 're going to these incredible events : following voodoor in the state of trance that touch a demonstration of the power of the power of the power of the power of the mind of the power when it cataling in a state of the body when it cataling in a state of the body .
It was all the populations with the most extraordinary , I lived the most extraordinary of the Sierra Nevada , in Colombird , in Colombiobird .
Dectors of the civilization , which had living on the planure of Colombial Colombial in the conquista , the populum popular , the popular popular popular , which ergets on the planture .
In a macchieving of slood , this popular , this popular popular was .
But , in fact , it 's governments from a cler but their formation is extraordinary .
The young people come up with the family to the family in the family , and they live in a world made of good homes and in a good world , and they live in the base of the base of the base of the base of the base of the base of the base of the base of the base of the base of the base in the world .
Two periods of the nor years of proposed to reduce the nine months of the gestation that translate in the mursuit of the mother , now are metaphor in the Grande Mther .
So , they get accultural values of their society , values that they predict their predict and just their preciate to eat the cost of their own equal ezer , or to say the equilibrio ef .
Al term of this incredible beginning , they 're improvisually taken out and for the first time in life , at them , to see a alba . And in that according of the first baly , when the wrong , the board of the wrong , when the bottom of beautiful , everything that they learned in the spending . The favored it is confermed in his spend .
" Is ? Does I said .
It 's study . Now , it 's to you protect it . "
They call it the major brothers and say that we , fratels , we 're the colcolors of the world .
This is extremely important .
When we think the ingene and invoicable to invote and the old environment and the old story of the noble self-self-self-self-wild , or perhaps and say that we say that these populations are closer to the Earth .
The populs are not born , it 's not slow-indebolites from nostalogy .
There is no space for these things in the palures of the Astat or the Tibet , but because it 's a mistic measures , they created a mistic measures , they created a mystical deal of the Earth 's known , but on a much more subtable .
What does it mean ?
It 's a saying that a guize of Ande that the Ande is a boy of Apu that 's a spirit Apu that 's going to be a human , and will have a human report , and it will have a human report , and it will have a bunch of a mention or that a little bit of a micro-ammass .
That 's the dimine is the hour or a high or a high hit .
What 's interesting is the metaphor that defines the methaphor and the natural world .
I grew up in the forest of the Britannic Columbia credding that the forests services for being wrong .
And what I realized me a human being from my friends Kwakiutl that they believe that the forests are the dimora of Hukukuk and the stories of paradied and the spiriters that live in the world , expladise of the world , explails that are going to do .
If you start to look at that these cultures can actually make different reality , you could start to understand some their sensitive discovery . We make this plants .
I watted this picture to open the nordoccial Amazon the Nororororcity .
Maybe some of you have heard about the ayahuasks , the most powerful such of the scientific repertorium .
What makes the playahuasks is not the potential to make macological potential , but his elaboration . It 's composed to two elements .
A lady , this lian lab that contains a series of cookay , harmine and harmine , and harmful , slightly slightly .
I can take the solar solar the plant is a blue that alters a little bit the cost , but it 's misceled with the fleaves of the coffee , the Psychotridis .
This is a lot of tripes , very much like a lot , very similar to the serowns , demethoxyployployployployployployployploypyployployplyployployployplyployptic .
If you ever see the Yanomami , you 're going to get a different set of a different set of a different set of species , anched methoxyployptamine .
Tiring that pollay on the nass is a little bit like being spared by a fire saying of the deal of dipink and return on a mare mit .
I wood often my , Richard Evan Shultes , the man who wadow the psychephysical , with his discovery , with his own own own own own own in Mexico .
I 'm a econd my tunch , you can 't get these tripes like , because if you 're not going to tell any of being square .
It 's possible to be absues , if you 're just a lot of summmen that money money in MAO .
Now , it 's the beautiful : the quote , they are in this liana are injumpitors of the same kind of the same kind of need to be able to be able to be . The question . The question is a square . The question of how these populations are in a 80,000 of a plants , like these little little population , but if you combine that if you combine this , they 're not to do this way , they make a lot of the way , they make a lot of the parts ?
We use the great eufy emimixes , and the herror , that can reveal infruit .
But if we ask the Indians , they will tell us , " The plants talks . "
What does it mean ?
This tribes , the Cofan , the Cofan , which is 17 variety , which distinguys are nectously in the forest , and our eyes are going to be in the same species .
If we wonder how they do they do their tasonomy , they will say , " I thought I was going to realize , " I didn 't know everything ? " I said , " No . "
The solution is : you take the 17 variety in a night of lun-hand , and each other .
With this is not a car to Harvard , but it 's much more interesting than content .
Now , [ [ applauses the problem is that we have heard of us who have heard the indigenes are pitting them , but in some way redoten you to the world , and pass it as a real world , and it turns out .
In the 20th century , between 300 years , it 's not going to remember or his drives , and its innovations , but it 's how we are stopen and we burn , and we have bad , and we have bad advanced by destruction of biological biological diversity and cultural cultural diversity and cultural cultural world . Now , the problem is not the change .
All the cultures through the secos have been involved in a room for new life .
And the problem is not the technology .
The Indians have no stopped to be Sioux when they put out of the arch and free as Americans don 't have to be Americans when they cut out of the Americans have been by horse and cales .
It 's not the change of the technology that integrity of the ethnosfhere . It 's the power .
The during the domination .
And if you say , you know , you know , you know , you know , these are not cultures to get to to discover .
They are living and dynamics and dynamics out of the identify existence that will be able to be in their ability of adaptation .
The discocococoping in the patria of the thinking of --
a popular popular ball in the Sarawak , in the op-asian populum that has lived in the foresta generation ago , and now redot to the servites , and now to the servites of the rive of the rive , where you can see the light-lied himself , where you can see the lights of the light-up of the Merday , where the Merday , where the Merday , where the horneorsport ,
You get the standing to reempies with the sotds .
Or , in the Yanomami , are the diseases that are come with the discovery of the golder .
If we spoke the mountains of the Tibet , where I 'm doing a lot of politics , you 'll see the politics of politics .
As you know the genocide , the physics , the physics , is condanned to the universal , but the ethnocide , the destruction of life , not just conditions of a popular popular , but they 're going to say , but it 's a lot of the strategy of development , because it 's part of the strategy of the development of the development .
And you can 't understand the suffering of the Tibet , until you 're going to start .
I lost the 6,000 miles from Chengdu in Chengdu through the Tibet , by the Tibet , by Lhasa , but just get to Lhasa , but just came to Lhasa , I realized what we have the statistics that we feel .
6,000 monuments in sacres and cenjoy and cense .
1.2 million people killed from military during the Cultural Rivolution .
The father of this guy was ascritical at the Panchen Lama .
which means that it 's been killed to the Chinese tempts of Chinese invasion .
I sell it was saying with Santity during the souldn 't have the populum in Nepal .
He was summer , was impressed and his collies was recognize .
It was taken to the bottom of two years , two years , nascondense , because it would not have to live without him .
The sister , which has been put in reeducation in reeducation .
A day has invertitly a day , a fascinating fascinating a raffering , and this transgression , was mespecially , the seven years ,
The Tibet can be insound , but the spirit of the popular popular is from the populum .
At the end , all , all you reduce a choice .
Let 's want to live in the world 's world 's world or we want to get to accover the world of the polowns ?
The great anthropoloothogic anthropologist , before he said that his greater , in our way to go to this vision of the world , we can 't just see the whole gareas of human imagination of human imagination , but a day we 're going to see the modality of thinking , but a day we 're going to sonce a day , but a day day we 're going to get a sonto the way that they were others .
And it 's equal to remember that our species is there for 60,000 years .
The Neologist Where , which has given us the agriculture , which has made us to have the seed of the sitting of the smoke of the slerquarchie with the property of the clerarchy , and we talk about 1,000 years ago .
The world industrialized world has been 300 years .
That slide any story not suggests that we have the answers to all the challenge that we should do fall in the millens to come .
When I have these miriades of the world is asked what it to say to be human , , respond with 10,000 different different .
And it 's in these risk , we all risk the possibility of being what we are : a kind of consciously , which has to make it a kind of consciously , and all the gars can figure out . And there are great ways of it . And there are great ways of it .
I walked this picture on the northern extremely , when I went to clear the balkin , when I went to cut up with the Inuit , and this man , Olaya , he telled me the wonderful story of his grandfather .
The government is not always been gentleman , and the Inuit and the 1950s to stump our sumatic such , we have them in colonies .
The grandfather of this man refected to go .
The family , I 'm trying to his life , and then his life , and all his life , and all his attacks .
You have to know that Inuit don 't temen the cold , they 're swake ,
The packles were made of the origin were made of fishing fishing in the paper .
The grandfather of this man , you didn 't get out of the artics or of the library , and the library .

It 's their new patria new patria .
It 's a territory of independent . They know all the mineraries .
One splay , example of how a nation-state can recognize with his popular popular .
And , for finishing , I think it 's quite obvious at least who of us was in these zone , make it remote that they don 't have to be remote .
For somebody is home .
They appeared sections of human imagination . And for us all , the time of these kids , like the sogers , the dreams of these kids , they become part of the swisdom of the hopefully of the hopefully of hope .
For finally , we have National Geographic , we are convince that politicians will never be to none .
We think the polemiics
[ Applauses are not persuasive , but we think the stories can change the world , and maybe we are the best institution to tell stories of the world . Ogn n our site . Ommen .

And we have to find a multural world .
where the sages of all the popularithrow , can contributing to our well-being .
Thank you .
I 'm going to talk about some of some things I written in this book that I hope you 've already heard and proverted to some of some college , in case , not nothing .
I want to start with what I call it " the official dogma . "
The official dogen of what ?
The official dogen of all society Western society , the cooking dogen , " If we want to massive citizing our citizens . " The way to do it is massive . "
The reason , is , from a late , in the fact that liberty is in the same one , is precious , use , it 's preciential for human beings .
As the other is in the fact that if we are libers , each of us can act for all that that massive massive , to do everything that we 're in nobody that decided in our name .
The way of the freedom is massive to maximmediately is massive choice .
The choice , the people have , more likely , and more liberty is their liberty , more liberty is their own .
This is so , I think , it 's so deep in the society that nobody would such a doubt .
And it 's also deeply readicated in our lives .
I 'm going to show you a few examples of what the progress has possible .
This is my sound . It 's not particularly great .
I lost a simple note to the conditions for inhealthy .
In my sound supermarket , there are 175 conditive , without conditive the extractly of the extractly of the extractly , and 12 acecuge number of conditions in the skin the rescious circumstance that no one of the 75 , already ready ready ready to your degree .
Here 's what 's the sounds .
And then go to the electronic electronic to buy a stereo , the CD , radio , the CD , radio , radio , printice .
And in this single negoties of electronic electronic components .
We can realize six million different and a half million different combinations that there are in a only goties .
You have to admit that there is a lot of choice .
Atri : the world of the communications .
I was a child , when I was a child , they could get all the phone , the phone that they were wish , to pat the moon the mom of the mom of the mom Bell .
He was the phone , they didn 't buy it .
A consequence of that , between the way , it was that the phone , he had never realized .
These tempts .
We have a quickly variety of the phones , especially between the phones .
Here 's the cellphones of the future .
My favorite is the middle , the MP3 , tut of nass , and the foreign , and foreign in the way to the crowd .
If you don 't even see it in the home , you 're bought to certain you 're going to get you .
And what happens is that the end of the end is that people in the negoods and ago , you know , what ? The answer is " No . "
It 's not possible to buy a cell that doesn 't do it too much .
So , in other aspects of life that are much more important than the budried , you know , the same exactly of choices .
Axianitary : it doesn 't happen in the United States that you go to the doctor and the doctor and doctor what you have to do .
And he winstead , you walk from the doctor , and the doctor says , " OK , you could do it , or B " As " A has these guys and these ansys , " B : " Okay , " Bokay . What do you want ? "
You know , " Dottore , what I should do ? "
And the doctor says , " A has these benefits , and these risks , and these risks , and these risks . "
" What does you want to do ? "
And you rebecame , " Dr. What if you were me , what would do ? "
And the doctor : " But I 'm not . "
The result of the result of the malaria , " " " " autonomous , " that it seeming it looks like a beautiful thing .
But actually , it 's not a switch and responsibility of take somebody knows , that 's the doctor , to somebody else knows -- and almost certain of it , and so almost certain is not a lot of course , it 's not in the ideal condition to make the patient patient .
There 's a huge marketing products , direct people like me and you , and you know , if you think it doesn 't have any sense , because you know , you know , you know , you know ,
But if we can 't buy them , why do the public ?
The answer is that they want to doctor to ask them to ask them to be able to ask them .
Something that is the fundamental as our identity is a choice , like you can see in this vignize the children . " We don 't want to force the kids . " We don 't want to get a hyourself . " We don 't want to invent a hyourself .
And we can reinventing how many times we have agree .
which means that every morning , at the answer , you have to decide you that kind of person wants to be .
I spect to the family and the matrimonium , a time time , it was that you know , almost for anyone , it was that you know , and he was that you know , and he started to make the most price as possible .
The only true choice was with , and it was not when , and it 's not what to do after .
On it , all is really to play .
I teach a very smart students , and I have 20 percent work , and I 'm going to do a time .
And it 's not because they 're not because they 're not because they 're less diligent .
But why are I impensierites , to ask , " Would I say , " Would I like to do it now ? "
" Would I think about it ? I have to think before ? I think before the kids ? "
I 'm interrogatives .
And they 're trying to answer these questions , even if this implics , even if this implessly , and you don 't completely get a vote to my extending to my extending .
And they have to do it . They 're really important questions .
Now , the job : we 're lucky , as Carl sockets , because technology technology allows us to work every day , every day , every day , from every day , transplay , which from Hotel Randolotel Randoll .
It was parently , there 's a corn , and I don 't tell any , where the WiFi works .
I don 't say , because I want to use it .
What does , this incredible freedom of choice we have about the work ? It 's going to work , and then , if we have to work or not .
We can go to see our son son , and then , with the cell phone , with the Blackberry , the Blackberry in the other , and the ntask .
And even though I 'm all spent , every minute that we see our son , we 're also asking , we also asked , " Do I have to say , " Do you know , "
" I have to answer this email ? I have this letter ? "
And also when the answer is " no , " , this makes the experience of your child , very different from what it would be in other conditions .
So , from any part of it , and we look at , little bit , and the big materials and life , life is a question of choice .
And the world was this : Ovous , there was some possibility , but it was not a question of choice .
The world today is a good thing , the dilemma is , " Is it , " What is a good thing , or negative ? "
The answer is , the answer is the South .
The positive souls them , so I 'm going to talk about the negative .
This is all this choice two effects of the people .
The first , paradoxially , is that produces instead of liberation .
With a lot of floor , which choose , becomes very hard to do it .
I want to offer a meaning : a study of further than the fabulous pensive plans .
A my colleages had access to the data of the Vanlooks , the gigantic society of thinking , with about a million clients in 2000 different different companies .
What she discovered is that for every 10 solutions that are offered in more , the percentage of the two percent .
With 50 of offering , there 's 10 percent adesions , in less than they are just five to dispone-hand , why are only five . Why ?
Because with 50 source of the floor , is hard to decide , and choice is hard to decide , and choice is remaining to the questions .
And at questions , and again , and I 'm questions , and of course , and I 'm going to ask .
You know , it means that these workers from the old old , they will be able to be for cans because they don 't have enough money , you know , it also , it means that the decision is so ostic the bottom of work .
It 's not talking about it , they 're losing to five dollars for a year from the dator of work , which would be disposed to be true .
So , the paralysis a consequence of the having of the purpose .
And I think that makes the world like this .
" And finally , to finish the ethernity : ketchches , or maionese ? "
Where would you take the right decision , if it 's the right , it 's why ?
You don 't want to choose the bottom , and neph the wrong conditive .
So this is the first effect . The second is that we can get to evitate paralysis , and do a choice , at the end of how we would have been with less than we would have been with less options to what we would have been with less than the options .
And this for different reasons .
One of these is that with a lot of conditions which you walk , if you buy a lot , and it 's not perfect , it 's easy to imagine that would be better . And what happens is it . And what happens is that the alternative imagine , and the record , and the record to the choice , and the recognize the makes of the decision ,
And when it was a good decision .
The choice is , more easy , it 's easy to be dispiones of any details that it 's insoditional than the option .
And there is what economists call the economists called the expensive opportunity .
Dan Gilbert asked a lot of how the value we 're going to do with the things that we think about what we do with the depends on what we do .
And in the rest , when there are many options , it 's easy to represent the carternative careful carternative , and be less subsides of the option that you have .
Here 's a example . I 've all got to all the ones that I 'm not in New York .
But it 's what you probably think about it .
There 's this copy to Hamptons .
A place of lush .
It faves splendida . Ottim . It 's all for them .
It 's not a way . But what he think is , " Well , what he think , it 's what it is . "
" All my neighbors to Manhattan is . "
" I could talk about front of the home . "
And it 's two weeks , the extending from the idea that 's losing -- every day -- the possibility of parking where you want .
The expensive opportunity is the deminuditive for what we have , even when choice was the excellent .
And the options that we have to look at , more the carteristic carteristic characteristic .
Here 's another example .
This is a lot of things like a lot .
It talks about the time , and maybe maybe living the living , and maybe living the living of living .
But the most important point is that any of what you have choices , you know , you know , you know , you know ,
The things that we don 't have a attractive attractive that can make less attractive what we do .
Terzo : it 's a growth of expectations .
I tried to my skin my beating a new couple of jeans .
I 'm almost always jeans .
I just once the jeans were a kind of , comprecord , and they were wild , they were purpose , they were just later , just after having them a lot of times , they started to go well .
So , I went to buy a new new couple when old old , and I said , " I need a couple of jeans , and I 'm going to say , " I need a couple of jeans . "
The committed me , " World Weas , easy , " World phit ? "
World ? " Dewashed the bottles ? " World As " or " hywashed ?
" Where does it do you want to be ? "
" Sott them want to be a lot of them , " Continured , " Continequal eleneneneneneneneny .
I was sbalordit , and after a little bit , I was able to say , " I want to say , " I want to say , " I don 't have any idea what was , so for a hour , I had a lot of jeans , then use out of the best jeans , and then , with the best couple of jeans that I ever had .
It was the massive . I had the massive . I had been going to get the best .
But I feel worse .
Why ? I wrote a book to understand it .
The reason I was going to be perfectly the whole choice , the jectops were very high , the jeans had to be perfect .
I was wait , I wait . I didn 't expected me . I didn 't expect me a kind of , but when I live a kind of 100 different , you know , at least a kind of messful ,
What I had a good , but it was good , but not perfect .
After I paragoned that choices with what I was trying to be in front of the expectations .
The add options in life of the people do not do that increasingly , that these are responective to the excellence of the options .
And this will be less under soddisfation , even when the results are good .
Nobody in the world of marketing if you get constantly .
Because if you know , you know , you know what I 'm talking about .
The truth of the most like this .
" The way he was better when he was worse . " The reason he was better when he was the worse when he was worse when he was worse , he was still possible to met the surprising packer .
Ost , in the world where we live -- opulent , industrialized citizens with the perform of performing perform -- the massive thing that we can hope is that the altitude of the expectitiative .
You 've never been surprisly because your expectations , because your expectations , you 're ingigantal .
The secret of happiness -- what you 're here -- " Basse , " Yes , " Yes , " Yes , you want to . "
I mean -- a little self-f-hard moment -- that I 'm really sitting and my wife is really study .
I wasn 't going to do it , I don 't have according .
But you know , it 's not a bad thing .
And finally , a consequence of the compring a couple of jeans is that when there 's just that kind of jeans is that when you 're not , and ask you , " Why ? "
" Who 's responsible ? " Well , the answer is clear .
The world is the world is the responsible . What could you do ?
When there are hundreds of jeans , and you get a hundred a sunck , and ask you , and ask you , you know , it 's the responsible , you 're like you .
You would be able to do better .
With hundreds of variety , there are no excited for the insuccess .
So when people take decisions , even if the result is walked , they 're walked , and they drawing the colpleasure of them .
In the last years , the depression is exactly the world industrialized world .
I think a meaning phatter -- not the only , but important , it 's important , but important -- of this depression is that the people have existens to make the high , because the standard are too high .
And when they have to explain this situation think that the color is their own .
So the end end of the end is that we 're better better , but we 're better , but we feel worse .
Let me remember .
This is the official dogen , what we all take for good and it 's completely falready . It 's not true . It 's not true .
There 's no doubt that a little bit of choice is better than it , but it 's not to have a little bit better than it is better than a little bit .
There 's a critical value , magic value . I don 't know what it is .
But I 'm sure we 've been superperated by a piece of the level where the best of our life .
Now , from the political point of the political view -- I 'm almost finished -- from the political point .
What 's allows all this choice in the industrial society is the rich material .
There are many places in the world , and you know , you know , where the problem is not that they have a choice .
The problem is that they too much too .
So the face of the face I 'm talking about is a disease of modern , recognize of modern , recognize .
And what makes to depriming and arring is this : Steve Levitt talked about how I 've talked about how those those are inuseful . It 's a spray of money .
I mean , these choices , complicated and dispendispends , it 's not just inuseful .
They 're advantly to the eteries .
They do it worst .
If a little bit of what in our society allows , it was reversed in those people where people have too much as people have too few people too much , it would be better , but also our life .
This is what economists call a better pareting .
A redistribution of the reddirection is good at all -- not just to be poor because of this choice in exceptable that you go back .
Fachise , " Well , you can become everything you want to be --
You know , the people think , what do you think , " What creds that fish ? "
" It 's obvious that you can 't get the wind a wind . "
" A cause of the world -- a limitate limited of the world -- "
and I 'm going to be like this , at the beginning .
But then , think , instead , instead , I realized that that fish knows the long knows the long knows the long knows that the longer knows me that the longest thing .
Because the reality is that if you get the bocks , it 's the bocks , in way that it 's possible . " You don 't get the freedom .
If you get the bocks in the way that everything is possible to be dealures .
Accentered the paralysis , and you reduce the well-being .
They need a sphere .
This is almost certainly too much , maybe even for the fish , and it 's just for us .
But the axide of a bunch of the became , and , and we 're , for the road ,
Thank you very much .
