I showed this last year I showed these slides to show that the glacial calculate , which for almost three million years had the size of 48 million years had the United States continental , it 's records to 40 percent .
But this subjective , this is not going to show the ice of the ice because it doesn 't show the ice of the ice .
The artics calotter is , in a sense , the critical heart of the global climate system .
You can see invern it and you revernothing .
The next slide is going to be a rapid of the last 25 years .
The ice lost lost of signed .
You know , you 're going to the blue down to the blue .
That 's the ice in the winter , which you reach extent .
You can see that the ice cosidgn , along five years or more , it 's like the blood , which is like the blood , which you can see that there from the body .
In 25 years , it 's been so , in this way .
This is a problem because the scale of the interest in the ice , the ice of the world around the artical arctic where there are enormous amount of coal congeled that , scientists , they 're transformed in metane .
I 'm going to spect to the totality of the atmospect of global warming , that amount of global warming , that amount of the world .
In some laghes in Alaska , the metane is already rebulating out of the water .
The professorous professorous Katey Walter of Alaska of Alaska , I got a team press the score .
Video : Wow ! Al Gore : I 'm good . The question is if we 're going to be .
A reason is that this exhic experiment to the Greenland from the northern .
This is a glacial reme .
The ported never had reached levels .
This is the Kangerlussuaq , in the west of the Greenland .
If you want to know how it is the sea level of the ice to the ice of ice , you know , here is where you reach it .
These corrings are increasing rapidly .
Another part of the planet : Antartide , the greatest block of the planet .
The month , the scientists have dichise that the ice of ice is in negative , and the Antarcttttarctttttttttttarly in some issues , it 's particularly rapid in the slightly , is particularly rapid .
It 's six feet of the hand-foot , like Greenland .
Himalayas Himalayas , the largest touches , you see new laghi lay , which few years ago were thirler .
The 40 percent of the world population was half of the world 's population from the wind .
Sulle Ande : this ice is the source of the water source of this city .
The down-up .
But when it diminies , the same happens to the water .
In California , the snow on the Sierra is diminuit .
The hydrogen are in cribe in cribe .
The predictions , like you read , are graves .
The growth section in the world leads to a night .
The disasters are increasing environmental disaster and without precedented by the normal and without precedently .
Four times more numerous than the 75 years ,
This is a huge thing .
If you look at it in the consequences if you can see the consequences .
In the last five years we 've added 70 million tons of a CO2 every 24 hours -- 25 million tons in the oceans every day .
Look at the same time , the Eastern Pacific , from the American area , to the west , and both the parts of the Indian , where there 's a poor of oxygen in the oceans .
The major causes of global warming , and deforestation , which is 20 percent , is the use of fuel fuel fuel .
The oil is a problem , and coal is even worse .
The United States are one of the two countries with more emissions , together to China .
And he was proposed to build a lot of coal other coal .
But we 're looking at a change of direction .
These are the annative projects in the last few years and some alternative alternative versus .
In every way , there 's a lot of politics in our country .
The coal industries and oil have spent 250 million dollars in the last year to promotion the coal coal , which is a bunch of coal .
I remember that I remember something --
I 'm going to be in the Tennessee , where I live , there was a 3.8 billion liters of carbon dioist .
Maybe you saw it on the news .
This is the second largest flow of scories in America .
It happened around the Natale .
The nature of the publishing of one of the carbon industry was this .
Video : â™« You know , the carbon is a kind of allegro and happy .
It 's abundant here in America , and makes our economy .
Frosty coal is more and more publisher .
It 's a good price , adorable , and the workers are the workers .
Al Gore : I 'm going to here is a lot of the West Virginia .
The largest mineraria society is Massey Coal . This is his administrator .
Video : Don Blankenship : I 'm going to ask -- Al Gore , Nancy Pelosi , Harry Reid -- not know what they 're talking about .
Al Gore : So Alleance for the Clima 's launched two campaiged campaiged two campaiged .
This is a part of it .
Video : Attor : All COLergy see the climate change like a threat the services like a threat to our business .
So , our priority to our priority is to investing a great amount of public money to make public and confused to make public and confused to coal .
In fact , coal , it 's not sports .
We think it 's also a good way -- it 's also a good profum .
So , not preocupateves .
Let me do you do .
Video : Attor : Carbon , you heard a lot of it .
So , you can do a turn in a structure on a structure on the sweet .
Straordinary ! The machine is a little rumorose , but this is the sound of the coal technology .
The coal consumption is between the main the main warming , but the night technology , the night technology , but the night that you see changes everything .
You have a look at this : this is the coal technology of coal clean .
Al Gore : At , the higher positive connects connects to economic question and at that of the national security .
Video : Compractice : America is in crisis ; the national security , the national security .
The field that the connects all : our dependence on the fossil fuel , like coal coal , and the importance of oil .
Now , there 's a new , car solution for use .
Repower America : 100 percent clean energy , in 10 years .
A plan to put America to work , make sure , make sure , and help us to stop the global warming .
It 's inally , a solution that baks the problems .
Repower America . Scover more .
Al Gore : This is the last .
Video : Compractice : It 's about record to America .
One of the fast ways to bring us to the dependence from the combustible that kill our planet .
What 's the future is here . I 'm going to do . It 's here , a new energy energy .
What do you think about the investments for ben ben jobs for brought ben .
Compractice : Repower . It 's time to be realists .
Al Gore : A veck proverbio say , " If you want to go fast , you go to the wind .
If you want to go away , you go together . "
We have to go away , quickly .
Thank you very much .
The last year at TED phectrdumption in the LHC .
And I promise to get back to the way to the machine .
So , I 've got to . And for the other time there were no , the LHC is the largest scientific experiment ever -- 27 miles of circumsters .
His task is to recognize the conditions that were less than a billion the beginning of the universe -- until to 600 million times a second .
All of this is just environment .
This is the machine under Ginevra .
We 're pictures , we 're going to do these mini-Bang mini-Bang mini-Bang mini-Big mini-Bang mini-Bang mini-Bang mini-Bang mini-Bang mini-Bang mini-mini-Bang minig mini-Bang mini-Bang mini-Bang mini-Bang mini-Bang inside .
This is what I work . It 's called ATLAS -- it 's largely 44 feet and a diameter of 22 meters .
This is a spectacular picture of ATLAS in building so you can see the proportion .
To tember last year we have accesum , we have access the machine for the first time .
And this picture was taken by ATLAS .
It 's until I was such a control .
It 's a picture of the first of particles that had done everything was the turn of the LHC , both in collision , of the LHC , and spread particles in the least .
In other words , when we see that picture that I was 10 tember , we know the machine , we understand that machine words , which is a big vitter .
I don 't know if it was this to do us to be more or this , when somebody went on Google and saw that the beginning was this .
That means that we had a cultural impact beyond that scientific .
It was a week later , there was a problem with the machine , had to these days here -- these dorrive damn dries here .
These files carriers are 13,000 prints when the machine works at the massim of power .
Now , the technical between you look at the challenge and say , " It 's not true . I 'm too much sot-table . "
And instead can do it because when they 're very cold site challenge .
So , at less 271 degrees , at a temperature in the space between the stars , these files can bring that corrate .
In one of the juntures of the most of namies in the LHC , there was a further of further .
So the files are warming slightly , and the 13,000 prints , and the 13,000 printed a electricity .
This was the result .
Now , this is even more impressive if you think these magnetic fish , the more than 20 tons , and you have been about 30 centimeters .
They 're saying at about 50 magnetets .
We had to take them , what we have done .
We have restined and traveled .
Now they 're returning all of their place .
I mean , the end of the LHC will be again .
We 're going to access it , and we expect to get the data to right now or lightly , and we continue our adventure to find out what the morning that are constitution to the universe .
Now , of course , in a way , these accidents reaccess the debate on the value of science and engineering in frontier . It 's easy to condent . It 's easy to concentrate .
I think the fact that it 's so difficult , I think it 's going to the limitations , I think is this value of things like LHC .
I want to conclude with the words of a Inglens , Humphrey Davy , which , I imagine , in defense , in the injust-in-a-the-like , his puployed in the way , his mind was Michael Faraday , said , " Nise is a lot of the ideas , which is not to have any mysteries in nature , which is not to be tought , and our monstrathy , that are not completely re-new monizes .
Thank you .
I want to start to ask you to think about when children , from children , play with the morning .
While you see it as you reach and you get them , and you get them and moving them , learn to think and slide problems , and you know , to solve problems and makes them relationship to the space .
The space reasoning is project to connected to the way we understand the world around us .
So , from information , by the information of our physical interaction with physical objects , and my consulsult Jeevan Kalanithi , and my collaborator , I started asking a computer , I started asking a computer , instead of a digital chicket , and if we use a computer , we could just have a widential handscape , we could deal with a desktop of the digital hands ,
and sistemards to our plonest our plonce ?
The question was so interesting that we decided to explore the answer , built the answer , built the Siftable .
In poords , a Siftable , a very much , a very , like a couple .
In poords , a Siftable , a very much , a very , like a couple .
You can move them with hand , they can see them , you know , the movement and they have a screen and a radio radio .
But , I 'm physical objects , like the morning , you can move it just to further simply further .
The Siften is the example of a new ecosystem of tools to manipulate the digital information .
And as they become more physical , consciously , the other people , and other people , and they become more physical , consciously , of others , how we can move , of others , how we can explore new tackage .
I 'm going to start with some simple example .
This Sift-hand is configurned to show the video : if you 're in a direction , the video raised so , if you 're going to the other side .
These things are interactive of the other people .
If you 're interested in what 's around them .
If you 're circuldial , they notice it and they can act a little bit .
If you 're circuldial , they notice it and they can act a little bit .
They also have their movement and inclination .
We have connected that one of the interesting implications of the interaction was the power to use communications , to advice as a liquid as if it was a liquid .
In this case , we have three Siftable configurated as secks of vernice and I can use it to the color in the middle that they 're missing .
and I can use it to put them in the central color in that central , where they mix .
If we 're too much , we can put a little bit about it .
It 's also beautiful possibilities of approviding , like languages , the mathematics and logical logical logical things where people can try to try to do the fast things , and see the results the immediately .
I 'm now --
This is a Fibonacks that I do with a equations .
We have a play-words that is half of the words and Boggle .
Pratically , at every turn a letter in a case on every Siftable , Pratically , every turn a letter in case , at every turn a letter on every Siftable , and while you try to buy it on a die .
Then , after about 30 seconds , you have a new set of lectal lecking and new possibilities to try .
Thank you .
Here 's the children came in the game at Media Lab , I 've done it so I was trying to do it and a video .
They 're very much .
And one of the interesting things about this application is that you have to have to be giving a lot of instruction .
You 've got to say , " The words of words , " and they know what to do .
Here 's the other people that are trying to .
This is our younger header , there 's right there .
It actually wanted to impilate them .
They were just morning , for him .
Now , this is a kind of a cardboard application .
We wanted to build a tool for the appreciation of the Lui is Felix .
It can insert new characters in the scene , solving the Siften their associated .
It can insert new characters in the scene , solving the Siften their associated .
So , it 's doing it to do the sunt .
Video : The suncer is .
David Merrill : Now he took a tractor in the scene .
Video : The aranim treator .
Bel work ! Yes ! Yes ! Yes ! Yes ! Yes ! !
So I school at Siftable and put it up close to the characters .
Video : Bau !
-- inventing your story .
Video : Ciao !
DM : It 's a story with the open , and it can decide him how it is going to be slide .
DM : It 's a story with the open , and it can decide him how it is going to be slide .
Video : Volice :
DM : The last example I 've been a tool example of you will show you a realized , to pleasure and exify music .
it 's a tool , recently , to walk and exef music .
The Siftable here are agism of sound , basically , and bacteria .
Each one of these has four different variations , and you can choose to choose which to use .
You can get these sound in a sequence to buried to your feet to comporse .
And it just just to do it simply , to be a " and a sequence . "
These are actually that you can control from the vive , like the reverbs and the filter .
You attacks to a particular sound and then including it .
And then there are the general effects like time and fly , and fly , you know , you know ,
We look at how it works .
DM : DM : We 'll start to put a base in two Siftable , " we 're going to put it in a series , we add the other things , we add the other base .
I put a line of basis .
DM : DM : DM : Now add some percussions --
DM : And I 'm going to put the bacteria , so I can control the effect from the view .
DM : DM : I can tell you how much fast the whole sequence inclinking the time by one side or the other .
DM : And I 'm going to add the filter to the bottom of the basis to give more expression .
DM : DM : I can recombine the sequence " to fly . "
So I didn 't have to plan it first , but I can improvisate it , it 's longer or more correct .
And now , finally , I can fump the whole sequence inclinking to the left the Siftable . "
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is to build new multiple machine more and more more more than the way to work and corporate .
And today , I had time to show you one of the results of this lost , and also some chance that we try to bring out of the laboratory .
The concept that I want to transmitted is that new generation of designed design design to interact with digital media , that will bring information in our world in our world way we want .
Thank you very much .
I don 't see the time to talk to all of you .
I 'm a writing .
I 'm going to write books is the more than that , of course .
It 's also the love and the fashes of my life .
And I don 't expect that can change .
But , I said , something particular happened in my life and my career , who took me to recognize the entire report with this work .
The particular thing is I recently written this book called " Mangen , " Mangogy , Prega , Am , " which , diversed by my previous book , for some reason , for some reason that I used in the world and become a big sensationship , bestsell-interaction .
And the result is that everywhere now , people are treatment to me as if I were condamanned .
Do -- condamage , condamage .
They 're going to me all worried and say , " Don 't you know , you don 't have to be able to do better ?
You don 't know about going to keep to write all life without more able to create a book that can important to make a book that can important somebody ? "
that can be important to somebody ? "
It 's rassure , you know .
But it could go worse , I remember that more than 20 years ago , when I started to say people -- I was a adolescent adolescent -- I was a writing .
I meet meet to the same as the same as well .
And people say , " Don 't be able to be able to success ?
Don 't you fear that the ubilation of killed you ?
You don 't have fear to do this mestion the whole life without that nothing is ever outside and dead on a heart of a dreams with the dinfrants with the piece of falliment to the falliment to the fill ? "
So , you know .
The answer -- the short answer to all these questions is , " Yes . "
Yes , I have fear of all those things .
I 've always had fear .
And I also have a lot of other things that people could not have to be indeed .
As the alges and other things .
But , as I think about the writing what I thought and I was going to be why is ?
Is it rational ?
It 's logical that anybody who are going to be spent by a job that you have been born to do .
But what is there is so particular in the impress creative , to make us nervous about health care about health in a way that other careers do not do ?
How my father , for example , he was a chemical engineer and I don 't remember a money in his 40 years of activity in which he was asked if he had fear to be engineer ?
It was never -- that block of the John 's engineer , how do it ?
Don 't work like this , you know ?
Onnnests like chemical engineers like group , they don 't really have a lot of , in the secoli , the reputation of being handed high .
We have a writers , we have enough this reputation , and not just the creative , but creative reputation of every gender , we have this reputable to be enormous instable to be huge instable to be enormous .
And it 's not the other thing that you look at the sad of the magnificent , just in the drives that just in the 21st century , they die and often their hand .
And the ones that are not suicipating data , they 're actually disdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdis
Norman Mailer , before he die in the last interview said , " Ogay my book has kill me a little more , " A straints about the work of their life .
But we don 't bate the hyet when we heard these things , because we 've heard these things that in some way we 've completely interized and accepted the notion that creativity and the inner are some way , you know , and the art , in the end , will be in the ancious , will be going to drive .
And the question I want to get all of this idea is : you 're according with this idea ?
It 's good about this thing -- because he also looks from a centimeteteteteteteteteteteteteteteteteteteteteteteter .
I think it 's odious .
And I think it 's even dangerous and I don 't want to see it in the next century .
I think it 's better to encourage our big creative minds .
And I know that , in my case -- in my case -- it would be very dangerous to start fire out to figure out the way I was in my way I 'm in my career .
It 's true -- involved , I 'm just young , I 've been about 40 years .
I still have about four decades work in me .
And it 's very likely that anything right now is going to be judated by the world as the work that came out of my last book .
I 'm going to slavery , because we are all more or less friends here -- it 's likely that my largest succeeds .
Oh , Gesus , who thought .
You know this is the kind of thinking that leads a person to start to get a person in the morning , and I don 't want to do it .
I would keep to keep doing this work that I love .
So , the question is , how do it ?
And so it looks like , after many reflections , that the way to work to write is to create a psychological costruction , OK ?
I have to have a security of security between me , which I 'm write , and my natural natural anxiety that I 'm going to be able to do it . And , as I was trying to do it , and I was looking at the time , and I was looking through time , looking at the time , to see if they could have a lot of ideas and sane and more sane .
in how to help people create creative to gesting people in the creativity .
And that research taken me to the Greach and ancient Rome .
I 'm going to do it in circle and then back .
In the antical Great and the Rome -- people didn 't seem to believe that the creativity came from men , OK ?
You thought the creativity was this spirit about the spirit , and that came to the men from one some surprised distant and unknown , for the distant and unknown .
The greatest creativity of creativity . "
Socrate , wonderful , he was created to have a demon the wisdom .
The Romanufaces were the same idea , but they called that kind of spirit a genius .
which is great , because the Romanime , because the Romanime didn 't really think a genius was somebody who was really smart .
They think a genius that a genius of entities that created literally lived in the murs of a artist , a little bit like the elfter Dobby , and that came out of the Dobby , and that came out of the work and model to be able to be assume of the job and model .
It 's about -- here , that 's the distance of which I talk about -- that psychological costruction that you protect from your work .
And everybody knew that was so that it worked , right ?
So the ancient artists were protected by certain things , like the too too , not ?
If your work was excited about it was excited , you could not take all the same , everybody knew that they had been helped this genius .
If your failure work , it wasn 't all your , right ?
They all knew that was your genius to be a incapable .
So people who are doing the creativity in the creativity in the Wcident for a long time .
Then Rends came up and all changed , and nacives this big idea ; we put the human being in the center of the universe , and misters and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and no longer and leave space creatures that they 're driving by the devate .
This was the major of the rational human rational and people started thinking about creativity came to completely hydivide .
And for the first time in history , you start to referred to this or that artist like a genius like a rather that one person with the genius .
And I have to say , I think it was a big herror .
I think I can allow someone , a simple person to believe as a recipent as the source , the essence and the source of all the divines , creative , inosconconcertability , inosconfile and ethern it is a responsibility for humans .
It 's like to ask someone to ingoods the sun .
Deform and destores completely ego and creates all these indes inside the performance .
And I think it was this pressure to advantly the artists in the past 500 years .
And , if this is true , and I think it 's , the question is , and now ?
Can we do it different ?
Maybe back to a more , more , the most of the relationship between human creative and mistery .
Or maybe not .
Maybe we can 't cell 500 years of rational thinking in a talk about 18 minutes .
And there 's probably people in the audience that would sollevered to the notion of scientific , insuspected people on the notion , you do that people are going to be square in their projects .
I 'm not going to convince you all about this thing .
But the question I want to ask is -- why not ?
Why not think about this way ?
Because it has more sense of anything that ever heard to explain the exasperformance of the creative process .
A process , as anyone who ever ever tented to do something -- so , all here -- you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you don 't understand it .
And , in fact , in fact , it can sometimes completely paranormal .
I did this meet recently with the extraordinary poetesse , Ruth Stone , who has been 90 years , but it was a poetesse for all life and told me that he was a poety for the rural infancient Virginia , and he was working out in the fields , and I felt it from the landscape .
He told me that it was like a broken of air .
And that was rotate to her from the landscape .
It was going to be , because he was tremendous to be under his feet .
He knew to have a solar thing to do at that point and it was , " course , " I would like a mathemath . "
And so I would say , and he was insequated by this poem , and it wouldn 't have to get a piece of paper and a fairly fastern , while the traphion and a quickly fairly , and he would get it to the page .
Sometimes I couldn 't be fast enough , so he would go and run without able able to get into the house and the poem rotated and she would go through the rotate and she would keep up through the landscape , and she would keep up through the landscape , and he said , " one other poet . "
Then there were those times -- this piece of a piece I will never forget -- there were some ways in which was almost loss , right ?
So , he was corrate to the house and was looking for the card and the poem was going through , and he was a writing in the way , and then he was like , and then he said , he was like to sleep with the other hand and the doulder .
He was the poem of the tail and he was put it in his body and the turned into his body and the turned to the page .
And in these cases , the poem would be presented on the perfect page and intact , but on the last word to the first .
So when I thought -- it 's just a purpose , it 's exactly equal my creative process .
Not my creative process -- they 're not a condition .
I 'm a music , and my way to work is ; I wake up at the same time every day and to work and split and pass it up .
But even I 'm even in my head , I have striked against that thing , sometimes .
And I guess that even many of you the han fact .
You know , even if the work and the ideas came to me from a certain source of a source you can 't know .
What is this thing ?
And how can we relationship to extent us to be able to lose , but , rather , rather , that do you get to snets to be stherefore ?
So , as I think about it , the best example of the world 's the music Tom Waits , which I 've interview is a different day .
We were talking about this , and you know , Tom , for most of the life has been the incarnation of the artist remarkable contemporary contemporary , by trying to contemporary , dominate these species of initized inhorized inhorized .
But then I 'm going to instead , and a day as he was driving on a automothers in Los Angeles , he changed everything for him .
It was going to go through the fast and all of a sent tract this little bit of elodia , which is in his head as inspiration , elusive and lectal , and the wants to you , you know , it 's wonderful , and the desider , but not know how to take it .
It 's not a piece of paper , not a math , it doesn 't have a matheist .
So I started hearing this species of old anxiety , I 'm going to lose , and I 'm going to lose , and I 'm obsessionate from this song .
I 'm not good enough and I can 't do it . "
And instead of going to go in the panic , it stop .
I 'm going to do the whole mental process and made something new .
I 'm going to look at the sky and said , " Do 't see I driving that I 'm driving ? "
" Do you know , you know a song now ?
If you really want to exist , you go back to a more opports when I can take care of you .
Otherwise , you walk to the other today .
You go to disturba Leonard Cohen . "
And his process to change after this .
I don 't work , the job was still known as a always .
But the process , and the fish that was attitched when the genius , the genius that was caused when he was taken out of him that problems and fliberated it to the other problems and fashion that didn 't have to be a whole thing thing to be a whole thing and rehyzed .
but they walk this peculiar , wonderful bizar-collaboration between Tom and this strange thing that allow-in-in-the-extremely and this strange and extremely strange .
So , as the story I felt that story is to change a little bit of the way I worked in my time and already told me .
This idea , I was saved when I was writing " Manogy , Prua , Ama , " and cave in one of the disperation that we all when we 're working on something and we can 't start to something and we can 't start to think that will be a disaster , which is going to be disaster , which is going to be the worse .
Not just burn , just the worst book book .
And I started thinking about gecting this project .
But then I remember about Tom that I was talking about the air and tried to it .
So I got my face in the drive and demand my hundred a vacuum vacuum .
And I said , " Sent , what you both , you know if this book is not brilliant to be brilliant , not be indeed with my , not be a bright , not be interaction , not be my , not be interly collit , not be interly high my , not be interly high my , not be interly bright , it 's not interactly my , it will not be interacted my , not be a bright , you know , it 's going to be brilliant , " Don 't be brilliant to be not be bril
Because as I 'm going to put it all I have no more than this .
So if you want to be better , you have to introduced and do your part .
OK . But if you don 't do it , I don 't know what I do .
I 'm going to writing the same because it 's my job .
And I want to do it for me that it was recorded to me my part of my part of my part , " Because it 's so , OK -- secoli ago in the deserts of Africa 's North people were rading to the clear to the clear to the midddances of lon , and sacra that were going to go on for hours and hours .
And they were always magnific , because the balwere professionists and they were wonderful .
But every time , rarely , something happened , and one of these artists becomes actually transendent .
And I know what I 'm talking about , because I know you 've seen it , at a point , a performance like this .
It was like the time stopped , and the balloon , and it walked through a kind of bral branch and not doing anything that 's about a different from the usual , but it was all sorts of it .
And in suddenly , not appears like a human .
But you accention the direction and under the fuoh in the smoke .
And when this happened , in the time , the people knew what was , they called the name .
They were the hands and began to cantar , " Allah , Allah , Allah , God . "
That 's God , you know .
I mean , the More invades -- when the More invades the south of Spna , preserved this abitudines with their and the pronunce in the secoli , Allah , Allah , " " " " Olay , " that you can still feel in the corride of the south .
In Spay , when a artist has done something impossible and magical , " Allah , words , " Allah , " I was , I 'm good , " I was writing , " I 'm going to be like God .
And it 's great because we need it .
But , the problem is the next day , for the balloon , when you see that they 're the 11 of Martedyes , and I 'm the 11 of Martedyes and God doesn 't there .
It 's just a mortal with the ginocked , and maybe will not be able to be able to get that already will ever be able to asclean .
And maybe no one will be the name of God still as it , and what 's going to do with the rest of his life ?
It 's hard .
This is one of the most sweet to do in a creative life .
But maybe it doesn 't have to be so angoties to be so angoties , if you can 't believe , the most extraordinary expects of your being from you are from you to be .
But you just think you have data in prested by a squisite squisite of this squisite of your life that you have to get to somebody else when you finished .
And , you know , if we think about this way .
And so I started thinking about , and it 's sure , and it 's just like I thought about it for a few months during the workers that publishing , I 'm going to stop practice , spenting , spented , I 'm going to follow my grander .
And what I have to keep to say when I feel elected by this is , not having fear .
Not to choice . It 's just your work .
It 's a little bit of introduced you to your part , any way .
If your work is balance , balls .
If the divines , lisurd genius to leave some kind of wonderful wonderful , for one time through your forced through your forced , then , " On it ! "
You 're going to do the same .
And " Ole ! "
I think I think it 's dedicate it .
" Olay ! " at yourself , even for having love and touches to be taken to be taken you to make you continuously .
Thank you .
Thank you .
June Cohen : On !
You know I 've been talking about some of some of these projects on the human genome , what can meant and the discovery of new genes .
Now , we 're starting a new way , we 've started digitalize biology and now now to start to the digitalize that we 're going to a new phase of biology , design and synthesizing and synthizing and synthesizing .
We 've always been trying to get big questions .
" What is life ? " It 's something that many biologists are tented to understand vary livels .
We tried a different approaches , reduced to the terms .
We 're digitalizing by the time .
When we sequenced the human genome , they were treated to the analogical world of the computer digital world of the computer digital world .
Now , let 's ask us : can we regenerate life , or create new life from this digital universe ?
This is the map of a little organism , the Mycoplasma genitalium , which is the species from the smallest genome that can self-laboratory .
And we tried to reduce the genome to create a more yet .
We 're able to eliminate a hundred genes of the 500 that I 'm here .
But when we have a look at his metabolic maps , it 's relatively simple respect to our .
I think I 'm going to do this is simple .
But when we look at all the genes that we can eliminate , one time , it 's very unlikely that this can bring a living cells .
So we decided that the only way to provided it was synthize this cromosome in way to make some of these fundamental questions .
So we started the adventure of " People can synthize a cromosom ? "
It can be the chemical to produce these big molecules that we never have been able to create before we have been able to create before ?
And in case , in case , can we have a cromosome ?
A romosome is just a piece of chemical material .
The speakers that we are able to digitalize life is exponential exponential .
Our skills the genetic code , instead , greutely lently , but it 's improve .
And our most recent returned the down-a-exponential curve .
We 've involved over 15 years ago .
The process has required a lot of pass , beginning with a biothic ree-to-experiments before we started the first experiments .
But we found that DNA is very difficult .
There are decs of the world 's machines that make small segments of DNA , the length of 30 to 50 letters in 50 lectal process : the longer segment is longer , more error , there are longer .
So we had to develop a new method to assemble these fragments and correct the errors .
And this was our first tentative , to start information about the genome of Phi genome , in the X 174 .
It 's a little viruses that kill batters .
We 've designed the fragments , effected the errors and get a molecule of DNA of about 5,000 lect-hand-up ,
The interesting part is when we took this piece of chemical material , and we put it in the bacteria , and we put it into the bacteria , and then we put it into this genetic particles and depths in the viral particles .
The viral particles have been releft by the cell , are back back and they 're going back and have been back and have destroyed the E. coli .
I 've talked about the oil industry and the oil industry and they have certainly compress that they have certainly compress this model .
They have more than you .
We believe that is a situation in which the software can actually build the same hardware in a biological system .
But we wanted to do things in big .
We wanted to build the whole cromosome of the bacterium .
I 'm more than 580 mies in the sectors .
So we thought we 've thought about it in the seven of the viruses , so that we can change the cassh of the viruses , so that they 're in a living cells .
The design design is crucial , and if we start with digital information in a computer , these have to be very accurate .
When we sequenced this genome for the first time in 1995 accurateess was a herror for every 10 miles .
We 've found , resequency , 30 herrors . If we used that original sequence , we would never be able to do it work .
One part of the process is designing segments that are subjective segments that are sudden with all the other segments of 50 letters to make subunit of a little bit more working together .
We try to do the only one here .
You know , you know , you know , we put it in the filigurs .
Think of it , we have a genetic code on four lect-based .
Three of those lectal condition , about 20 minoacids , and there 's a specific order to every adminods to every adminods .
So we can use the genetic code to write words , frames , frames , frames .
What we 've done in the beginning was self-doing .
Some of them were in the fact that it wasn 't a poem .
We 've designed these segments to just just to be to only to injumped with it .
There are a hymes that are reputting them and put them together .
And we started assemble to assemble of the parts , beginning with seven miles , unending it to segments to make segments to be to form 24 mile lectal lecketches to get to 72 mile .
We have produced these sequences in abundance so that we have sequencing to sequencing a building that we 're trying to create a very very robustood -- like you 'll see in a minute .
We 're looking for automatizing the process .
So , this looks like a tabellon the tabellon the basis .
When we get to these very long , the more than 100 mies , more than 100 mies , they 're not growing more directly in the Ecoli .
You get to the modern limit of the modern biology .
So we 've been looking at other mechanisms .
We knew , we knew mechanism called recombination , which in biology to use the biology to repair DNA that you can see the DNA to une segments .
Here 's an example .
This organism , called Deinococcus radiodurable , can absorbs three million rad of radiation .
You can see in the sudden require like his cromosoma .
In 12 -- 24 hours is reassembled exactly like it was before .
There are thousands of organisms that are able to do it .
These organisms can be completely sect .
They can live under vacuum .
They 're absolutely certainly exists in space , and you feel to find new receive water .
In fact , NASA showed that this happens .
This is a picture of the molecule that we 've built with these processes , just using the lipted by the segments to insert .
The least lies the self-axiatically .
This image was not taken with a microscope , but with a microscope , but with a regular microscope .
It 's a lot of molecule that we can see it with a microscopic microscopic laws .
These are pictures that cover a period of about six seconds .
This is the publishing that we 've done a little time ago .
It 's more than 580,000 lect-code .
It 's the largest molecule of a definitely defined structure of the man .
It has a fish molecule on 300 million .
If we stop it with a 10 without a careful 10 without spaces , you would like 142 pages to transmit this genetic code .
Now , how do we work ? How do we activity ?
Of course , you can see a viruses is a game of boys .
It 's a little bit more complicated when they use the bacteria .
It 's more simpler when it is the eucariote as our : you can just get the nucleus and insert another , which is basically the nucleus and insert another , which is basically the clonation .
In the bacterium , the bacterium is instead of inside the cells , but we have recently showed that we are able to do a transplant to a cell of a cell to another activity of activity .
We can reflicated a cromosome from a microbial species .
The two are different than men from the topes .
We 've add some gene in more way to decide what I choose to choose to do for this cromosoma .
The hundred the encies with the encies .
And when we put it in the cells was stupendown-handed graphic graphic graphic graphic graphic -- the new cell cell .
And we were initially thought we could not go beyond , but we tried to spaces it in there .
This is one of the major mechanisms of evolution .
We found that a lot of species have added to a second or a third cromosome of a thousand new hundreds of new tracks of that species .
So who think about evolution as a only gene to evolution like this , and it doesn 't understand the biology .
There are the involved of restription that advanced digerature , they 're doing digerism .
The cromosome that was in the cells not have one of them .
The cell phone that we have inserit-hand-out .
You know , it 's expressed , and recognized the other cell , like a bunch , has masticate , and we 're returned with just the cells and the new cell cell and the new cell cell .
It has become became blue because of the genes that we have insered .
And in a short leave of time , all the characteristic characteristic , and you have transformed all in a new species , based on the new species that we have insered in the cells .
All the proteins are changed , the membranes are changed , and when we read the genetic code that we 've been transfer .
Now , this could look at the genetic software , but in the software DNA , we can change things in the way .
Now , I 've been explained that here is not talking about the genesis -- but to progress from three million years and a half million years , and I 've been told that maybe we 're going to create a new version of Cambrian in which will be able to create new species in this digital process .
Why do that ?
I think it 's enough obvious when we think about our needs .
We 're to spend from six billion and a half billion in the next 40 years .
I was born in 1946 . I was born in 1946 .
Now there are three people on the planet for each other , in 1946 , there are four years .
We 're having problems now to find food , fresh water and clean , and switchen and a half billion people .
It 's more saying more to do it for nine billion .
We use more than five billion coal baries , more than 30 billion baries of oil .
That means millions of baries a day .
When we try to find biological processes , or whatever kinds of process to reduce them , it will be a huge challenge .
We have to keep all the emission of CO2 from these materials that finished in the atmosphere .
At day , thank you to scientific discoveries all the world , we have a database with about 20 million genes , and I like to think they 're designed to think they 're designed for the future .
The electronics industry , just just a dozen about a dozen of components , and think about how many things come come out .
Our limitations here are the biological data , and our imagination .
Now we have now , thank you very much about these metods of synthank , we can create what we call fighting genomics .
We 're able to build a big robot that can produce a million cromosome of a day .
Think about processing these 20 million different genes or to try to get the processing processing processing the processing processing , and new vaccines , and new vaccines , and to create more biology , and create more biology , and create more biology , and create more biology ,
And it 's just a standard to the standard .
We can choose for a chance of survival , production , chemical , production , and fuel , production of the etc .
This is an instantaneous instantaneous programmed that we 're working for to be able to seat and design species to the computer .
Well , we don 't know about how they 're going to be .
We know exactly what is their genetic code .
Now we 're now concentrate on the fuel of quarters .
You 've seen you that extract ethanol from gran experiment .
We have a second depending on the generation and third generation that are going to be surprise as much as the opten than the eight-value , or different butanol .
But the only way biology can have a big impact with more impact with more impact with more than the food and limitate the cost of food and limitate the disponable to be to transform the CO2 in matter , which we 're working to design cells that can reach this discovered , and we think we could have the first coal of those generation in about 18 months .
The solar light sunlight with CO2 is a metodom -- but in our discoveries in our discovery .
This is a organism that we 've been described in 1996 .
It 's in the ocean , about 2500 feet of depth of the water .
They 're put out of CO2 using hydrogen molecures like energy .
We 're looking for a figure out if we can incanalone , which can actually be transported by treatment , convert that CO2 in fuel , to drive this process .
So , we think we could be able to increase what we could be able to increase what is life is the basic question , " which is life is Nothing , we have the goal of reduce the whole industry of oil interaction .
Yeah . If you can 't do it from TED , where can you can 't do it from TED , where can ?
It would be a main the source of energy .
And we 're working on using the same metods to create vaccines .
You see this year with the influence , we 're always back to a dollar in less when it 's about a dollar in less when it 's going to find the right .
I think that you can change building vaccines in a very much .
That 's how the future could start seem to look at change , now , the evolution of evolution , accelerating the evolution with bacteria synthetic , and finally inspired eucariote .
We 're so so much from the best people .
Our discover is to do enough to live enough to try to do it . Thank you very much .
I 'm going to show you , the most rapidly possible , some fundamental work , some fundamental work , which we 've taken to Microsoft in a year ago ago . This is Seadron .
It 's a environment that you can interact with a huge amount of data .
So here we 're seeing a lot of digital pictures with a kind of photographs with a kind of zoom and continuous quick , to a quick quick , disponing the images as we want to .
And it doesn 't matter how big the amount of information that we see , how big these are the data or the images of data or the images .
Most of the digital photographs , but this for example is a scanning scanning from the Biiooka , and reentertaining in the gama of 300 megapixel .
It doesn 't make any difference because the only thing that limit the prestations of a system like this is the number of players on your screen in your screen in any time . It 's also a very flexible architecture .
This is a book book , example of data not not images .
This is the Dickens . Every colonna represents a chapter .
And to show you that it 's just about tree and not images , we can do something like that , to make something like that , to make a real thing about the representation of the test , not a photograph .
It could be a little bit of artificial book to read a book .
It 's not about it .
This is a more realistic . It 's a number of the Guardian .
Every images is the beginning of a section .
And it really gives you the pleasure and the beautiful experience to read the version of a revision or a quotidian , which is for nature a moltle of a half .
We also have done something with the corner of this particular number of the Guardian .
We 've created a fasules in higher publishing -- much more higher than that you use in a normal publisher -- and we put you in a normal published .
If you want to see the characterists of this self-mobile , you can see here .
Or other models , or even the specific patterns .
And this really shows some of these ideas to eliminate the limits of space on screen .
We hope that means to put it finally , to put the pop-up pop-up , you don 't have to be necessary .
Of course , the mapplications is one of the obvious applications for this kind of technology .
And I don 't want to lose time , if we don 't have the contributes to do this field .
These are all the streets in the U.S. .
So now we 're going to be at something else .
This is actually actually , from the view of the Web ; you can go to .
It 's a project called Photosynth , which combine two different technologies .
A is Seadron and the other is a visual research a very interesting research by Noah Snavort , a student of Washington , with Steve Sitz 's aid , with Steve Seitz 's U.S. . Take , a Microsoft Research .
And it 's from the Web , gestion the Web .
You can see it when we do this kind of patterns , where we can spend from a picture and have this kind of experience to multiple and have this kind of resolution .
But the space of the space of the images here has actually a meaning .
The visualization of the computer have recorded these images together , so that corresponding to the place , in a way that the recorrespond to the recorded images -- all the near wspapers , and these things are all the space . So , you see the Roctopped -- so the people see elements of a slide show show . So , these things are all colleagues .
I don 't know if I 've been time to show you some more environment .
There are some more space .
I want to spend directly to one of the original data -- and this is from a previous previous recently , that we 've done for the first time to work for the first time the extent that we 've done to be really the first time the scortedly drive this technology , the Photosynth . And it 's not necessarily simply ly simply looking at the environments that we have in the site that we have in the website .
We had to worry about the laws and foreign expected .
This is a rebuild of the Crister 's rebuild in Notre press from Flickr Badigitar . Badigitar Flickr and you get images of the other fies of the other campus , other campus and saying out . You know , you know , to be able to find this model .
So , they 're all pictures from Flickr and they were all colleaged to this way .
And it 's possible to navigate this way simple .
You know , I would never have thought about it to be working for Microsoft .
It 's very gratifying this kind of account here .
I think you can see that it 's a lot of different kinds of kinds of different kinds of photocamera : from those of the phones in the SLR , a number significant , meaningful , put together in this environment .
And if I can get it , I 'm going to try to look at the most strange .
There are a lot of them , etc .
You know , some part here is a series of photographs -- here .
This is a poster of Notre Dame recorded correctly .
We can spend from the physical vision of this environment .
The essential point is that we can do things with social environment . This now is taking data from the entire driving data -- from the whole memorize of the way to apply , from visual visual -- and college all of these data .
All those pictures become more of the som of the parts .
You have a model of the land that emerges emerges .
Think about this as a such as a Stephen Lawler on Earth virtual .
It 's something that grows in complexity as people are using it , and the advantages to the use .
Their photographs are handed with other people .
If somebody comes the idea of contraction all these saying saying the name , my photographs of Notre Do improvisely , you get to all those data , and I can use as a kind of indow of all these data , and can use as a little bit of indeed in space , in that metaphimmerged in that way , and have a cle-mos-motion of cle-moment of cle-mos-in and red red experience .
Of course , a consequence of this is virtual model of all the interesting model of all the interesting model , collecting not just from the airplane and satellitariarithers and satellitarian and satellitary images and similar .
Thank you very much .
Chris Anderson : I understand ? What your software is going to be going to do is that a point in the next few years , in the next few years , in the next few years , all the photographs , all the photographs in the world will be able to be together ?
BAA : Yeah . What 's doing is basically discover .
It 's creating hyperlinks , if you want to , you want to be , amazing .
And it 's doing it in the base of images .
The thing becomes very interesting if you think about the receive information to recognize the security of these images that many of these images are able .
As when you do a research of images on the Web , you digits a frase and the text tbook on the web has a lot of information about the picture .
Now , what if you have this photographs to all your pictures ?
So the amount of interconnection and the amount of semantical and the amount of recognize that is really huge . It 's a classic classic effect of the networks .
CA : Blaise , it 's really incredible .
BAA : I 'm very much .
One of the main pipes , when you travels and one of the research of the etnographics that 's power to live in the anti-traditions , who have the past in the wind , the touch of the past , you know , the touch in the wind , you 're in the floor .
Basti think that Jaguar travel even beyond the Via Lattea , or that the Inuit 's still a meaningful mostly of meaningly , or in Himalayas , the good people are still in Dharm , to remember the major important important , to remember the central anthropology , and the idea that the world that we live in any sense , but it 's just a model of fact , but it 's just a model ,
the consequence of a particular set of choices that our stroyed , well or mal , many generations ago .
And , of course , we all share of the essential tracks .
We all are . We all procrease .
We are subjects to return out of the beginning .
We need to deal with the inesorability of death , so we don 't surprised if we cancer and ballize --
We all have a art .
What collies is the physongs , the rhythm of every culture .
Not that they 're the Penan " of the Borneo , or the following Borneo , or the following Vodoo , or the desert Kaisut in Kenya , or the Kenya , or a nice in Kenya , or a nice in the heart of Sahara .
He was my company in the journey of journey in the wild of the journeator , the yak of the Commolangered , the demand the mother of the world .
All of these people are teaching us that there are other ways of exists , other ways of thinking about , other ways of move in the world .
And , if you can reflecting a moment , it 's a concept that can give you hope .
Insit , with my cultures of cultures in the world creating a spiritual life and cultural that we wanted to the planet and it 's important for the benefit of the planet as the biological renature .
And you can think about this cultural ragela cultural ethnossphere and you can definition the ethnosphere , the total ethnos-up , dreams , death , inspiration , inspiration , inspiration , inspiration , inspiration ,
The etnosphere is the patrimonium of human .
It 's the symbl of what we are and about what we can be in how inquisitive .
And because biosphere was actually consumed altreatment has been very quickly , and purpose much more .
Nessels biologist , it would say that 50 percent of all species has been or the orezes of the extinction , because it 's false -- in the most apocalittical , or more optimistic -- and you don 't even even close to hypothesis -- and you don 't even even even even even even even close to -- that that of the different cultural diversity .
The indeed of all that is , of course , the loss of languistic .
When you 're born 6,000 languages on this planet .
A language is not just from a vabolary or from a series of rules .
A language is the sprazy of human spirit .
It 's the middle of every culture is going to the animal world .
Every language is a forest of mind , a pensive thought , a thought , a spiritual ecosyritual possibility .
And of those 6,000 languages , as we are here in Monterey , at least half of the children is not more surprised in the old children .
They 're not teached to children , the kids that means , unless you won 't walk , you know , not wills .
What is there more sad than being the sad , of being the last , of being the last to talk to a language , of not have to have to transmit the landwisdom of the advancing or advanced the promise of the kids ?
This orring is the state of someone in some part of the world every two weeks : every two weeks , a moment , and a moment with the syllabs in the last syllabs of a ancient language .
And I know somebody to say , " Isn 't like that ?
The world would not be a better place if we all are the same language ? " Well , we 're talking about all yorba . We talk to all yorba . We talk to cantonese .
We talk about kidyes .
You 'll cover a tract thing to say that you can 't talk about your language .
Today , I would like to do a journey through the lecnossphere --
a little journey in the etnosfied to give you a assage of what we 're losing .
Many of us forget that when I say , " different ways of exist , " different ways of exist .
We take for example this books , Barasana , in Amazon , the settrional popular , which creds to the myth of the anacon the west of saces in the west of sacres in the sacres of sacres .
It 's a popular popular that is not able to distinguish the blue because the extent of the green because the exhibition is identified in the forest , which depending on the forest .
They have a strange language and a mathematrimonial , detects exama language , " You have to move a person who is a different language .
All of this radical has been in the past , yet the particularity is that in these families that are in these families , in which you 're talking about six or seven language , because of the mathematrimselves , no one language .
They 're limitate to listen and then start to talk about .
We take one of the most interesting tribes that I 've lived , the Wadian Ecuador , a popular that has been the first contacts in 1958 .
In 1957 missionaries have tented a facturing herror .
They 've done by the photographs that were were in pose that were in pose popular , forestimate that this popular population had never seen anything of the pluvial foresta had never seen wheel of bi-dimensional .
They 've got the pictures from the Earth , they turned to the research of a form or a challenge and , not by the way , they have concluded that they were treated with the lance .
But the Waorani doesn 't just kill the straneors .
They kill them kill between them .
54 percent of the mortality was caused by the same .
We 're risales to eight generations and we found two of natural morte and when we 've been stayed to know , they have a lot of them were invited to , and then they were kill it , and then kill it it was killed with it .
The craft were able to recognize the animal from 40 pass and recognize the species .
In the early ' 80s , I was assigned a very interesting task when my professor Harvard asked me if I wanted to go to Haiti in the secret society to the secret of the Duvalier and Tonton Macoutes , and impossesser to do the speed to do the zomages .
To give a sense of miracogical , I had to understand the Vodow culture and Vodoo is not magnery .
It 's pretty much of a complex metaphysics of the world .
A lot of interesting .
If I ask you to say about the big religions of the world , what would you say ?
Sristianesimum , Islam , Buddism , Ebraism , etc .
A continent is always left out of , thinking that the sub-Saharan Africa has not likely , and Vodoo is not else that the distillate of these religious concepts of these religious concepts very profound about these religious concepts of tragic , deep tragic wake .
What makes the voodoo is the intense is the intense of life and death .
So , the visual people are going to the spirits .
The spirits can be invited by Great the Great the rhythm of the dance and replace to replace in the anim of the vive way that for a bribe the way to be the tal in a short way .
So , you know , the voodoist , they 're going to talk about God .
We say in the temple and divention the temple and God . "
And from the moment you 're going to be , you know , you know , you can make you get the walking you ?
So you 're going to have these incredible events : following voodoo in the state of trance that touch a demonstration rather than the power when it is catalyzed in a state of mind when it is catalyzed in a state of extreme , exciting .
It was the popular popular with the most extraordinary is the Kogi Kogi of the Sierra Nevada in the Santa Marta , in Colombia , in Colombia .
To endendences of the civilization that once were living on the planes of Colombial in the conquista , the popular popular stery , the popular population was on the planture of the planture .
In a macchiated blood , this popular popular , this popular has never been conquirt by the spagnolious .
But today , they 're governed by a cler-the-traordinary formation is actually extraordinary .
The young people following out from the family in three or four years , and they live secreated in a world fact of good and hombs in a world fact of good base of the ice to the ice of the ice for 18 years .
Two draw years of proposed to reduce the nine months of the nine months of gestation that turn in the users of the mother , now are metaphorically in the user of the Great Mother .
So , that 's all about time , they 're acculturate to their society , values that predict their predict and their preice to their preice and their preice to keep the cost of equilibrium , and to say the ecological .
At termines of this incredible beginning , they 're improvisely taken out and the first time in their life , in their age , in 18 years , they see a high . And in that accouncil the first cutes , when the suncle suncle valley , when the suncle valley , everything they 've learned in his splay . The prete thing that they learned in his spending . The prete predict does a ftendorglay ,
" Do you want to be like I said .
It 's stupend . I 'm going to you to protect it . "
They call it the major brothers and say that we , fratels minors , we are the colate of the world .
This is intuition .

The Indigenes are not easy nailed by nostalogy .
There 's no space for these things in the paluuds of the Astststage or in the gelids of the Tibet , but thank you at the time and rhythers , they created a mystical thing to the end of the Earth is not on the concept of being knowledge : the concept that the Earth can live in the consciousness .
What do you mean ?
It 's a guy that a guy of the Ande that grows the mountain is a spirit Apu that 's going to drive his destiny to be a human destiny , will have a very different relationship to the mountain , and it 's going to have a little bit of a little bit of a rocket that a mountain of Montana , and you know , you know ,

Mayahuasks about the ayahuasks , the most powerful such of the scious repertoial repertoial repertoial repertoial repertoial repertoial repertoial repertoial repertoial repertoial repertoial repertoial repertoial repertoial repertoietic .

I had often with my professor , Richard Evan Shultes , the man who wake the psychedelic , with his discovery of the psycheel in Mexico .
I 'm not going to get these triplotamin this triplotamines like because if you 're not tell you to tell any of being telled . [ Rist ] ] triplotiny ] [ Risdom . tripames can 't be horely because they 're money from a very , because they 're in the inside of the in-in-the-in-size .
It 's possible to be absumerely if you 're just a little bit of sucks that money are the MAs .
Now , the beautiful : the draa-carboline , they 're injumps in this lian injumption , of the same kind of need to be able to be the tripamine . The question is in a 80,000 species of plants , how do these popular people , like these popular people , but if you can fight a version , but if you can fight to this way , create a biochemical version , that 's summmma to the sometimes ?
We use the big eures of proof the error and error , that can revehicle .
But if you ask the Indians , they 'll tell us , " The plants talk about it . "
What do you mean ?
This tribes , the Cofan , has 17 variety of ayahuasks , which distinguy in the forest , and our eyes would reach in the same species .
If you ask them how do they say , they 'll be able to do it , " I thought about plants , I thought about plants , I don 't know about it all ? " I said , " No . "
The solution is : you take the 17 variety in a night of lon , and each other , it 's going to be a different .
I don 't have a car to Harvard , but it 's very interesting to content the stami stami .
Now , [ [ you open the problem is that even the problem is that the people who have heart the indigenes are pitting them , but in some way to redotts , you know , in our real world , and pass .
In fact , the X-century , in 300 years , it will not reminded for the wars or the innovation , but rather like the technology that we are stopped and we have been used to be used , and we have been used by activally or accepted the destruction of the biological and cultural cultural and cultural cultural cultural and cultural cultural cultural to the planet .
All cultures through the secoli have been involved in a dance for new chance of life .
And the problem is not technology .
The Indians Sioux didn 't stop being Sioux when they put it out of the ark and fill so much as the Americans have been a part of Americans when they 're caveling out of the cavels and heat .
It 's not the change or technology that threatening the integrity of the ethnossphere .
The fly of domination .
And if you look at the world , you 'll find that these are not cultures that these are not cultures to be undaries .
They 're creating living and dynamics that exist from identific forces that are going to identify their ability to be in their adaptation .
My discover in the pendent of the Penan --
a popular popular , in the Asian , in the asiat-asiat-libree , a popular that has likely to a generation ago , and now to the prostitution to the prostitution on the rive and prostitution to the rive the rive of the rive , where you can see the figure out of the riverse that looks like the window as the middd-slightly ,
You get the standing to the stage of the team .
Or in the case of Yanomami , are the disease that are coming with the discovery of the gold .
If we can move on the mountains of the Tibet , where I 'm doing a lot of research , you 'll see the during political domination .
As you know the genocide , physical extinction of a popular , is condannect to the universal , but the ethnocide , destruction of a popular popular life , not just conditions , but it 's just not just conditions , because it 's part of the development , because it 's part of the development .
And you can 't understand the Tibet , until you can 't understand the beginning .
I lost the 6,000 miles from China in China , in the Western Tibet , by by Lhasa with a young , and by Lhasa jumption , but just came to Lhasa I realized thing is behind the statistics that we feel about .
6,000 sacres sacres in the polvy and cends .
1.2 million people killed by the military during the Cultural Rivolution .
The father of this guy was ascritical at Panchen Lama .
which means that it was kill to be kill in the Chinese Indian .

A day day , he had a drive draw a draw offering Mao and , for this transgression , was put it on the seven to seven years .

At the end , all you reduces to a choice .
We want to live in the world of the monoy or we want to get the policicromatical world of the different policicromatical world ?
The great anthropologioga Margaret Mead , before he said that his largest fear was that , in our towards this vision of the world , not just see the whole gama of human imagination , we 're going to a limitate and a day us to a limitation of thinking , but one day we 'll be able to swake up to a sleep , and we 'll be able to lose us .
And it 's ubillion our species is exist for 60,000 years .
The Neolitical volution , which has given us the agriculture , which has done us to have a seed cult , and replace the poem of the slightly poem with the clery of the clerarchia , and we talk about 10,000 years ago .
The modern world industrialized has been 300 years .
That several history not suggests that we have the answers to all the challenges that we have to get in the millenny to come to .
When these myries of cultures of the world is asked what to say to being human , they say , they say with 10,000 different voices .
And it 's in these answers that we all risky the chance of being , we 're going to be what we are : a conscious , which has to make everybody in the popular people and all the gars can figure out . And there are great ways of optimism .
I 've been taken this picture on the extremity of the island , when I went to cave the hung of the Baffin Inuit , and this man , Olaya , he tells me the wonderful story of his grandfather .
The government is not always gentle with the Inuit and in the 1950s to stage our own premise , we have it into colonies .
The grandfather of this man refigure out of this man ,
The family , I 'm going to do his life , and all his life carried .
They have to know that Inuit doesn 't have cold , the way .
The slitms in origin were made of fish , were made of fish flip .
The grandfather than this man did not intimise from the night , or from the librarizing .
It 's gauled out , you get the pantalone in the skin in failed photos and defected in your hand . When I did the tank you do it , he 's working on a lama .
It 's spraised on the dots of this college , and when I solid , he kill a dog .
He wells the dog and created a bank , with the household , he created a slitt , has been a sliterally , and it 's disappeared on the ball , and it 's sthetic , and it 's sleep in reast .
We want to talk about cavarsely with nothing ? [ Rism ] And this , in different ways , [ Applauses is the symbl of the Inuit and all the inuit of the Inuit and all the indigenius of the world .
In 1999 , the 1999 government government has given to the total control of a territory of a larger area of territory of the larger California and Texas mitting together .
It 's their new patria . It 's called Nunavut .
It 's a huge territory . They all the minerary resources .
One splends like a natione-state can recognize with his popular .
And , finally , I think it 's pretty obvious at least who of us has been in these remote zones of the planet , realized that they 're not at remote .
For somebody 's home .
They represent sections of human imagination that are treating at the time . And for us all , the dreams of these children , like dreams of these children , become part of our children , become part of the hope of our children , become part of hope .
For finished , we 're convince that politicians will never get to none .
We think the polemiics --
[ Applauses are not persuasive , but we believe that stories can change the world , and maybe we 're the best institution to tell stories of the world . Every month to tell stories of the world . Every month is about 35 million living .

Our work is travel in the ethnossphere to bring our public in places that they go out of the same cultural , and they 're hoping , they 're hoping , holding , they 're hoping , holding to the central anthropology : the world 's world to be in a pluralycle and multicultural medicine .
in which the wisdom of all the people can contribute to our college benefit .
Thank you .
I 'm going to talk about some things I wrote in this book that hope I 'm going to say that you 've heard and proverted to some of some connections , in case not them .
I want to start with what I call " the dogen offical offical . "
The dogma official dogen officer than ?
The dogen official dogen of all the industrial societies , the dogen offical dogen , " If we want to massive to do the benefits of our citizens " The way to do it is massive . "
The reason , from a moon , in fact that freedom is in the same value , is precious , useful , it 's precious , in the human beings .
In the other one is in the fact that if we are free , each of us can act for doing everything that massimilar to do everything that massimilar our well-being , without any decided to our well-being , without any decided in our name .
The way to massimilar massimilar to the freedom .
More people , the people have , more are free , and more is their liberty , is their own , the major is their well-being .
This , I think , it 's so redly radicated in society that no one would have to put it in doubt .
And it 's also depth in our lives .
I 'm going to show you some examples of what progress has been possible .
This is my supermarket . It 's not particularly big .
I 'm going to be a simple note about the condments .
In my surface , there are 175 conditions , without content 10 variety of oil , and the 12 of oil and 12 aceages that you can buy to you a huge number of condition in the breaths that no one of the 175 of them already to be your degree .
That 's what the supermarket .
Then you go to the electronics to buy a stereo stereo : casse , CD , radio , radio , radio , radio , radio , lefer .
And in this single negotie of electronics , there 's a big number of components .
We can make six million and a half of a different combination using the components that there are only in a store .
You have to admit that there is a lot of choice .
Altrack camps : the world of communications .
Once , when I was a child , they could get all the desire the phone , the desive phone that were provide by mama Bell .
It was about the phone , I didn 't buried it .
One consequence of that , between the other , it was that the phone is never repoured .
These days are gone .
We have a variety of telephones , especially between the phones .
Here 's the cellular mobile phones .
My favorite is the middle , MP3 , three-touches of the nets , and foreign the key to the lin the lin the lin the middle ,
If you don 't have seen it in the store , you 're going to be in the home , you 're going to get it .
And what happens is that people are in the stage and does this question . And you know , what is the answer ? The answer is , " No . "
It 's not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn 't do things .
So , in other aspects of life that are much more important than the budget , you know , the same exhibition of choices .
Austence healthcare : it doesn 't happen to the United States that you go to the doctor and doctor , what you have to do .
Instead , won the doctor , and the doctor says , " Okay , we can do A , or you can do A , or " Hoh , " Hoh , " By these benefit . What do you want to do ? "
You get the say , " Dr. What should I do ? "
And the doctor says , " A has these benefit and these risks , B has these benefit and these benefit . "
" What do you want to do ? "
And you can 't do you ? "
And the doctor : " But I 'm not . "
The result of the result of the damage of the malical , expression that makes it look like a beautiful thing .
But actually , it 's not that a posting , and the responsibility of taking somebody knows the doctor , to somebody else knows the doctor , at somebody knows -- and almost of course , it 's not in the ideal condition to take the patient .
There 's a huge marketing , direct people like me and you , you know , you know , if you think it doesn 't have any sense , because you can 't buy them .
But if we can 't buy them , why do you buy them , why do you have it ?
The answer is that they want to doctor to do them with the doctor to ask them to change our recipe .
Something about how much fundamental is the same time is a question of choice , like you see in this vignize , " We don 't want to force children . We don 't want to force the right now . They will be a hydrop their right now .
And we can reinventing us how many times we have .
which means that every morning , at the time , I 'm going to decide that kind of person want to be .
I 'm going to spect the family and matrimonium , a time , uncontriage almost for anyone , and he was that he was that you know , and he started to get the most possible , and he started to get the most possible .
The only real choice was with who , not when you 're , and not even what to do after .
It 's really about it .
I teach very smart students , and I do 20 percent of work to a time .
And it 's not less brilligent , because they 're not because they 're less diligent .
but why are they impensierites , I 'm going to say , " I should not ? I have to do it now ? I should not do it now ? "
" I should be later ? I have to think before ? I thought before the bottom or the career ? "
They 're interrogative .
And they 're trying to answer these questions , even if this implation not completely the companies that assea beautiful vote to my own own own own own .
And they 're really important . They 're very important questions .
Now , the work : we 're lucky , like Carl such , because the technology allows us to work every day , every day , every day , every angle of the planet , in the angle of the planet , in the angle of the planet , and the Hotel Randolyptil Randolyptic .
I 'm talking about , there 's a corner , and I 'm not going to say no one one , where the WiFi works .
I don 't say , because I want to use it .
What means , this incredible freedom of choice that we have about work ? It 's going to work ? It 's going to keep , and if we have to work or not .
We can go to see our son , and we can play with the phone in a tasks , the Blackberry in the other , and the notea , and the notetee book , and the ginocchia .
And even though they are all spent , every minute that we see our son , we 're also asking the game , we are also asking this called ? "
" I have to say to this email ? I have to abbol this letter ? "
And even when the answer is no , " that makes the experience of your son 's danger of your son 's very different than what it would be in other conditions .
So , by any part of the things , and the big things , things , the materials and lifestyle , life is a question of choices .
On time the world was this : There were some chance , but not all of a choice .
The world today is a slimma is : " Is it , it 's a positive thing , or negative ? "
The answer is Shit .
We all know , the slide we all , so I 'm going to talk about the negative .
All this choice , two negative effects in people .
The first , paradoxes , is that produces instead of liberation .
With a lot of choice , which choose to choose , becomes very difficult to do it .
I 'm going to offer an example , a conduct on the flight-pensive conduct .
A colleages had access to the data of the Vantum , the gigantic society of pension , with about a million clients of the implemented in 2000 different companies .
What she discovered is that for every 10 solutions that are offered in more , the percentage of adesion the adesion the two percent .
With 50 sours , there 's 10 percent of adesions , when they 're dispones just five percent of them . Why ?
Because with 50 sours of failure , is sick , is sick to decide , and choice is remaintain to the inks .
And at questions , and again , questions , questions , of course , and questions , of course , I 'm not going to be .
You know that doesn 't just mean that these workers are going to eat food for cans because they 're not going to have enough money , to say that the decision is so ostics that they are lose the deep of complementary the deep of work .
Not parking , they 're losing up to five to a dator of work , which would be workers to be in real .
So the paralsssis a consequence of having too much choices .
And I think it makes the world like this .
" And finishing , to the ethernity : ketchup , senapes or maionese ? "
You want to take the right decision , if it 's for the ethernity , right ?
You don 't want to choose the source , and neptip the condition condition .
So this is the first effect . The second one is that we can have the paralysis , and do a choice , and we 're not unless than the result of how we would be had been with less options of how we would be not have been in the result of which I would choose .
And this for different reasons .
One of these is that with a lot of condments that you would have been , if you buy a and it 's not perfect , is easy to imagine that you could have been better . And what happens is that you would be better . And what happens is that the alternative imagined us industry , and reduce the reduce of the choice , and reducient the recognize the decision ,
And when it was a good decision .
There are choices , more easy is easy to be dispileften than any details of the option .
And there is what economists are called the constood .
Dan Gilbert has been very well as a value that we see things about depends on what we 're going to depends on what we 're confront .
In the rest , when there are many options , it 's easy to represent the characteristic characteristic , and be less undly undly undly , you know , the option that it 's choice .
Here 's an example . I love with all the people who are not New York .
But it 's what you probably think about it .
There 's this cople to the Hamptons .
A place of luses .
It 's going to splay . Otttttank . It 's all for them .
Not nothing . But what he thinks is , " Well , built , built , it 's Agofurther . "
" All my neighbors in Manhattan is . "
" I could talk about front of the house . "
And pass two weeks , the chance of the idea that 's losing -- every day -- the chance of parking parking where it wants .
The constood defation is the ddisfation for what we have , even when the choice was the old .
And more options that we have to consider , more the characteristic characteristic active constantly .
Here 's another example .
This vignize us a lot of things .
It 's about the time , and maybe maybe the moment , maybe of living lently .
But the most important point is that anything you choice , you can 't do the other people .
The things that can 't choose are so many active attractive attractive what we do .
Thiral point : it 's going to grow the expectations .
I tried it on my skin beautiful a new couple of jeans .
I 'm going to be jeans .
Once the jeans were just just like , you buy them and vestivestivestia , were discovered , just after having them a lot of times , and worked on a lot , and worked , and they were going to go well .
So I went to buy a couple when the old old people , and I said , " I said , " I need a couple of jeans , this is my cutter . "
The committed me , " Li wants to slim , easfit , relaxphit ? "
Do you want to the cernight-in-in-hand ? "
" Do you want to strapped them ? "
" Sott them want to the gets , " Budblaw , " Continured it .
I was sbalort , and after a little bit I was able to say , " I want the kind of the kind of , " I want to say , " I want to all of the jeans , so I tried everybody who was going to be jeans , and then use out of the jeans , and I had ever had .
It was the massive . I had the best . I had been doing the best .
But I felt worse or worse .
Why ? I wrote a book to understand it .
The reason I was worse is that with all of the choice , the myself was very high , the jeans had to be perfect .
I was waiting , I waiting about that . I didn 't expect anything excited when it was just a kind of a kind , but when I live in 100 different , and it had to be perfect .
What I was buy was good , but not perfect .
After I had paragoned that choices with what I was trying to inseed in the expectations .
The add options in life of people don 't do that increasing the expective expected to the old people that have respect to the options of the options .
And this is going to produce less under the results , even when the results are good .
Nobody in the world marketing if they realized it .
Because if you know , you won 't know what I 'm talking about .
The truth is more about this .
" The reason he was better when he was worse , " The reason he was better when he was worse , he was worse , when he was worse was worse , you can meet to meet the surprisers .
In the world , in the world that we live in -- opulent , industrialized citizens with the expection of perliving -- massive that we can hope is that the altitude of the expectation .
You never have surprisly surprised because your expectations , the mixture , you 're ingigantic .
The secret of happiness -- what you 're here -- is , " Basse wait , " You want to wait . "
I mean -- little self-biographic time -- that I 'm really sposed and my wife is really stunew .
I couldn 't have to do better , I didn 't have acted .
But you don 't always have a good thing .
And finally , a consequence of the comprate a couple of jeans is that when you 're not to be sudden , and you say , and you ask you , " Why ? "
" Who is responsible ? " The answer is .
The world is the responsible . What could I do ?
When there are hundreds of jeans , and you buy a slightly , and you ask you who is the responsible , and you ask you who is the responsible , it 's responsible to you .
You should be doing better .
With hundreds of variety , there are not excuses for the insuccess .
So when people take decisions , even if the result is , you know , they 're sentertained , and they give the herself .
In the last years , the depression is explose in the industrialized world .
I think a significant factor -- not the only one , but important -- of this honto depression is that people have experiences because the standard are in the depression of the standard , because the standard are too high .
And when they have to explain this situation think that colcolor is their .
So the end of the final result is that we 're better , objectively , but we feel worse .
Let me remember .
This is the dogen official , what we all take for good and it is completely false .
There 's no doubt that a little bit of choice is better than having not to have a little bit more than not have a little choice is better than a little bit .
There 's a critical value , I don 't know what it is .
But I 'm sure we 've been going to a piece of the level in which the miles are improve our life .
Now , from the politician -- I 'm just finished -- from the politician , the nocity is the following .
What allows all this choice in industrial societies is the recognize material .
There are many places in the world , and you know about it , where the problem is not that they have choice .
The problem is that they have too poort .
So the cencing to which I 'm talking about is a disease of modern , remembered Western society .
And what it does to be like to be , and arrage is this : Steve Levitt talked about how I 've been talking about yesterday , and it 's a seats of money . It 's a sphere of money .
I mean these choices , complicated and dispends , it 's not just that they 're useful .
They 're addictation .
We do a worse or worse .
If a little bit of what in our societies are allows to be reversed in those where people are too much as well as a few chance , it wouldn 't be just improve their life , but also our .
This is what economists call a improvement .
A redistribution of the redent is good at all -- not just to the poor -- because of this choice in excess that you go back .
To conclude , " Let , you can become everything you want to be --
You know , people are , you think , what does it do ? "
" It 's obvious that you can 't get it in a wind bocks . "
" A cake imagination , a limited vision of the world -- "
I 've interpret it so , at the beginning .
But then , think about it , instead , I realized that fish the knowledge .
Because the reality of fact , it 's that if you 're eating in frantum , so that , " you can 't get the freedom . You get the freedom . You get the paralssss .
If you 'll get the bocks in a way that all of the degree ,
You get the paralsssis , and you 'll reduce the well-being .
All they need a sphere .
This is almost of course , very much much fairly , perhaps even for fish , and of course for us .
But the assfies a few bombolic symbolic sfer is a recipe for the flection .
Thank you very much .
