I showed this year I showed these slides to demonstrate that the glacial calculation , which for almost three million years had had the size of 48 percent .
But this subjects this is a gravity of the problem because it doesn 't show the spend of the ice .
The arct glacial calots is , in a certain sense , the cup of the global climate system .
It 's going to inverintense and you get to the summer .
The next slide is going to be a fast-degree carlated on the last 25 years .
The ice lost lost of perennia .
You see , you can see , you 're going to blue .
That 's the ice inverinter , which is the ice of inverintense .
You can see that the cosidgn , of five years or more , is like the blood , which is like blood , which is like the blood , which here is the body .
In 25 years , it 's spent from so ,
This is a problem because the scale of the ground of the ground , the ground of the arctic , where there are enormous amount of coal congeled that , snake , they 're transformed in the microbes .
I 'm paying to the totality of the atmosphering global warming , that amount of global warming , that amount of the world .
In some deep in Alaska little deep in Alaska metano is already bolling from the water .
The professoresse Katey Walter of Alaska of Alaska , a team was caught with a team cut .
Video : Wow ! Al Gore : I 'm good . The question is if we 're going to be .
A reason is that this termal examse is that this term is that 's Greenland from the northermal .
This is a river river reme .
The downnaked hadded .
This is the river Kangerlussion in the southwest of Greenland .
If you want to know how it is the level of the sea level of the ice , here is where it can achieve it .
These corrunning are increasing rapidly .
On the other part of the planet : Antarcttars , the biggest of the planet .
The month scored scientists have been tuned that the ice of the ice is negative , and that Antarctica , and that Antarcticde Western , which is a little bit of a submarine , is particularly rapid .
It 's six feet of the hand-foot in Greenland .
On Himalaya , the third biggest blockets , you see new laghi , which a few years ago , who were were glaciers .
Fith-percent population was going to be able to be able to be able to the weleless .
Sulle Ande : this glacier is the source of the powerful water .
The downnership .
But when it decrease , the same happens to be powerful water .
In California , the snow on the Sierra Nevada is diminuitous about 40 percent .
The hygrim are in cribe .
The predictions , like you read , they 're graves .
The growth security in the world leads to a remarkable increasing .
The environmental disaster are increasing a return out of the normal and without previous .
Four times more number of times over the last 30 years of the early 75 .
This is a huge thing .
If you look at it in the storytelling if you can see the consequences .
In the last five years we 've add 70 million tons of tons of CO2 every 24 hours -- 25 million tons in the oceans every day .
Look attention the Eastern Pacific area , from the American , to the west , and on both west , and both parts of the subcontinent in the oceans .
Most of global warming , together to deforestation , and that 's the 20 percent , is use of fossil fuel .
The oil is a problem , and the coal is even worse .
The United States is one of the most emissions , with China .
And it was proposed to build a lot of carbon .
But we 're looking at a changing of direction .
These are annoullated projects in the last few years and some of alternative alternative .
Everything is , there 's a politics in our country .
The coal industries and oil industries have spent 250 million dollars in the last year to promoting coal , which is a bunch of clean .
And that image of this image --
I 'm going to be Natal , in the Tennessee , where there was a loss of 3.8 billion lighost .
Maybe you saw it on the news .
This is the biggest flow of these in America .
It 's successful around Natal .
The nature of one of the coal industries of one of the coal coal of the coal industries .
Video : Will carbon , Frosty the carbon is a plegror and happy .
It 's abundant here in America , and it 's going to grow our economy .
Frosty carbon is more and more and more .
It 's good price , adorable and working working working working maintain the styple .
Al Gore : As here 's a lot of the West Virginia .
The biggest mineral society is Massey Coal . This is his administrator . This is his administrator .
Video : Don Blankenonkenship : Al Gore , Nancy Pelosi , Harry Reid -- they don 't know what they 're talking about .
Al Gore : So the At for the Protecton Clima has launched two campaiged .
This is one of them , a part .
Video : Atter : Actor : At the COLergy see the climate change as a threat .
So our priority is to invest a great amount of money in a force public force to make public and confused to the coal .
In fact , coal , is not sporous .
We think it 's not clean -- it 's also a good profuse .
So , not preocupatevable to climate change .
Let me do it .
Video : Atter : Carbone , you 've heard a lot of it .
So , let 's let 's go into a turn in a structure at the pattern of the coal ,
Straordinary ! The machines are a little noise , but that 's the sound of the coal of the coal is clean .
The coal consumption is between the main the global warming , but the global warming , but the technology of coal warming that you see changes .
You 're a look at a look : this is the hodial technology .
Al Gore : As the Gore : Indeed , the positive is connected to the economic security and to that national security .
Video : Look America is in crisis ; the crisis , national security , the crisis .
The field that all of us : our dependence that we have to be able to be , like coal and oil .
Now , there 's a new , car , car solution for it .
Repower America : 100 percent of clean energy , in 10 years .
A plan to put America to work , make sure , and make sure , and help us stop global warming .
It was inally a solution that you can solve our problems .
Repower America . Scover more .
Al Gore : This is the last .
Video : Comvon : It 's about re-giving energy to America .
One of the faster ways to get to dependence on the dependence that killing our planet .
What it 's going to do is here . As , only only one , a new energy you will .
What it 's two : Noves two : Nown-retribes .
Comvalvalue : Repower . It 's time to be realistic .
Al Gore : A old old old African , the old proverbial African says , " If you want to go to .
If you want to go , go together . "
We have to go away , quickly .
Thank you very much .
Last year at TED phery in the LHC .
And I promise to return to the car .
So , here I have a lot of them . And for those who didn 't have , the LHC is the largest scientific experiment ever -- 27 kilometers of circumference .
His task is to remember the conditions that were under a billion by the beginning of the universe -- to 600 million times a second .
All that is simply environment .
This is the machine under Ginevra .
We 're taking these mini-Big Bang inside the remarkable .
This is what I work . It 's called ATLAS -- it 's a 44 feet and has a diameter of 22 feet .
This is a spectacular picture of ATLAS in building , you can see the proportions .
Ten September year we have access the machine for the first time .
And this picture was taken by ATS .
It was because of immense with a festyle in the control .
It 's a picture of the first of particles that had done everything in the LHC , both , both in collision , by a part of the LHC , and spreading particles into the LHC , and spreading particles into the relator .
In other words , when we see that image that image 10 to September , we understand that machine worked , which is a great victory .
I don 't know if it was this to be able to be exultent , when someone went on Google and saw that page was this .
That means we have a cultural impact beyond that scientific .
At a week later , there was a problem with the machine , I had to have a problem with the machine .
These files bring 13,000 amps , when the machine works at the machine works at the machine .
Now , the technicians between you look at the files and say , " It 's not true . I 'm too throwing . "
And they can do that because when they 're very cold safety are very cool sunder the slows .
So , at less 271 degrees , at a temperature in the space between stars , these files can bring that corporate the corporate space .
In one of the gamamamong of the namile of the LHC , there was a fenvironment of free .
So the files are surrounded , and the 13,000 printing , and the 13,000 printing of electrical resistance .
This was the result .
Now , this is even more impressive if you think that these magnets more than 20 tons , and that have been moving from about 30 centimeters .
They 're damances about 50 magnetets .
We had to take them , what we had to do .
We have them and adverted them .
They 're now now now , they 're all right now at their place .
I mean , the end of marzes the LHC is is going to be again .
We 're going to accening , and we expect to get this data to july , and continue so our adventure to find out what the morning for the morning that is the universe .
Now , of course , in a way , these accidents reaching the debate on the value of science and engineering in frontier . It 's easy to confuture .
I think that the fact that hard is so hard , I think it 's the value of things like LHC .
I 'd like to conclude with the words of a scientist Inglaugh , Humphrey Davy , which , imagine , in defenseful experiments of its own , the puple , Michael Faraday , he said , " Nichael is that it 's not a very dangerous for the human return to the ideas , which is not in the new way , which our monkey , which is not in the new , and that our mountain , and that 's not completes are not in the new monkey . "
Thank you .
I want to start to ask you to rethink about when children , you play with children , play with the morning .
While you understand how to reach them and slightly to get them and move them , and learn them , and learned them , and learned , and they 're going to solve problems and manipulating relationships .
The space is deeply connected to the way we understand the world around us .
So , from information , from the use of our interaction with physical objects , and with the conon Patts , and my collaborator Jeevan Kalanithi , I started asking me , " And if we 're a computer , instead of having the only cursor as we have the only cursor of the digital poller that is moving on a desktop information with both manes ,
and we have to sistems ?
The question was so interesting that we decided to explore the answer , building , building the answer , building the Siftable .
In a few words , a Siftable , a Siften interactive computer .
In a few words , a Siftable , a Siften interactive computer .
You can move them with hand , they can see , " between them , " I feel their movement and they have a screen and a radio screen .
But most of it is physical objects , like the moroncins , you can just move .
The Siften : The example of a new ecosystem for manipulate digital information .
And as they get more physicistic , consciously , consciously , of other , and as they become more physical , consciously , of how we move , of the other people like moving , we can explore new and different intertal styles .
I 'm going to start with some simple example .
This Siften is configurated to show video : if it 's a direction , the video is going to run it like this , if you including it back .
These interactive interactive , they have consciously aware of the other .
If I face them , they 're interested in what they 're around .
If they 're surrounded , and they can act a little bit .
If they 're surrounded , and they can act a little bit .
They have a lot of their movement and inclination .
We then realized that one of the interesting implications of the interaction was the power of data , to put in the data , for example , " to fall . "
In this case , we have three Siftable configurated as secks and I can use them to put them to color in the color in that central , where they mix .
and I can use them to color in that central color in that central , where they mix .
If we 're too much , we can reput a little bit at a place .
You also have a beautiful chance to learn , like languages , mathematics and games where people can try and see the things that fast , and see the results of the immediately , and see the results of it .
Now , I 'm --
This is a Fibonacks that I do with a program of equations .
Here we have a game of words that 's half in Scarabeo and Boggle .
Pratically , at every turn to be a letter on every Siftable , Pratically , at every turn to any turn into any Siften turned on a case on every Siftable , and while you 're control about a direct .
Then , after about 30 seconds , you have a new set of letters and new set of letters and new possibility to try .
Thank you .
Here 's the children came in the game at Media Lab , I did so that I was trying to them and put a video .
They were very much .
And one of the interesting things that kind of application is that you have to have a lot of education .
You 've got to say , " I mean , " I mean , " I mean , " I mean , " I 'm going to do .
Here 's how other people who try it .
This is our younger header , there on the right there .
It actually wanted to impact them .
They were only morning .
Now , this is a compared application of an interactive cardboard .
We wanted to build a tool for the learning of languages . It 's Felix .
It can insert new characters in the scene , solving Siften their associated .
It can insert new characters in the scene , solving Siften their associated .
So , it 's doing sun .
Video : The source is source .
David Merrill : Now he brought a tractor in the scene .
Video : The arancient treator .
By work ! Yes !
So I hundred Siftable and put up closed closed to can make the characters .
Video : Bau !
and that 's in their story .
Video : Ciao !
DM : It 's a story with the window , and it can decide how it comes .
DM : It 's a story with the window , and it can decide how it comes .
Video : I go away , threat .
DM : The last example I have the time to show you is a tool , recently , to figure , to figure , to figure out and exef music .
it 's a tool , recently , recently , to figure out and make music .
Siftable here are act from sounds like based , based and based .
Each of these has four different variations , and you can choose which use .
You can also be insering these sounds in a sequence to you .
And it just to move it to simply do a touch , and a " sequence . "
These are actually that you can control from vive , like reverbs and the filter .
I carry to a particular sound and then including it .
And then there are the general effects like time and fly , which is going to apply to the whole sequence .
We look at how it works .
DM : DM : We 'll start putting a base in two Siftable Siftable , we 're in a series , we add , add , we add other base .
Now , I put a basis of based .
Video : DM : Now I add of percussion --
DM : And I 'm going to put the bacteria to the bacteria , so I can control the effect from alive .
DM : DM : DM : I can fly the whole sequence by a time by a moment or from the other .
DM : And I 'm going to add the low-based filter to get more expression .
DM : DM : DM : I can fight the fly .
So I didn 't have to planning it first , but I can improvision , make it longer or more short .
And now , finally , I can do it the whole sequence with the left Siftable to the Siftable . "
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is building new interface mate new interface , and more and more and more and body 's body .
And today , I had time to show you one of the results of this performance , and also some chance that we try to bring out the lab .
The concept I want to transmitted is that 's coming this new generation of design design designed to interact with digital media , which will bring information in our world in the way we want .
Thank you very much .
I don 't see the time to talk with all of you .
I 'm a writer .
I 'm to cut is my profession , but it 's more than that , of course .
It 's also love and love the faascine of my life .
And I don 't expect that it can change .
But , he said this , something particular happened in my life and my career , who took me to remember the whole life , and I brought the whole whole thing .
The particular thing is that I recently written this book , this biography called Mangan , Prega , Ama , " which , diversity of books , for some reason that , for some reason was used in the world and become a great sensational , bsationship , bsitation , bswilling .
And the result is that everywhere go , people treat me as if I was condamannoed .
It 's true -- condanned , condannation !
They go from me now , everyone worried and they say , " Do you don 't be afraid to be able to do ?
Do you 're not going to be writing for all life without able to be able to create a book that can do you do a book that ? "
that can be important ? "
It 's rassure , you know .
But it might go , at the part of that I remember that over 20 years ago , when I started to say to people -- I was a adolescent adolescent -- I wanted to be a written .
I meet I meet the same reaction .
And people said , " Don 't I have successful ?
Do you don 't have the equipment that killed you ?
Don 't you fear to do this for all life without nothing that nothing is going to come out and die on a heart of dreams with the feeling of the bouth of falliment with the pink of failure ? "
So , you know .
The answer -- the short answer to all these questions is , " Yes . "
Yes , I have fear of all those things .
I 've always had fear .
And I have also fear of a lot of other things that people could not have to have .
As the algap and other things are spent .
But , as it is about that I thought , and I was going to be a last mention ?
Is it rational ?
It 's logical that anyone who has to wait to be spent by a work that 's been born to do .
But what is there is so particular in the creative impress by making nervous , in a way that other careers do not do ?
How my father , for example , he was a chemist engineer and I don 't remember of one in his 40 years of activity where he was asked if he was afraid to be engineer ?
He was never -- that blockingeer of John , how do it ?
Do it didn 't work like that , you know ?
Onests , the engineers like group don 't have certainly , in the seats , driven the reputation of being handed .
We have this reputation , we have enough this reputation , and not only writers , but creative of every gender , we have this reputable reputable reputable .
And it 's not remarkable to look at the sad of death magnificent minds that , only in the century , they died young and often for them .
And the ones that don 't have overwhelmed data looks like .
Norman Mailer , before he died , in the last interview , he said , " Every , my book has killed a little more . " A great affermation about work .
But we don 't buy cilly , when we feel that because we 've heard these things that in some way we completely interior , we completely interized and accepted the notion that creativity and suffering are somehow , and that art , at the end , it will be hard .
And the question I want to bring all here today is : you know , you know , you know , what do you agree ?
It 's good , it 's really about this -- because he looks at a centimeter of distance to me , it doesn 't really well for nothing .
I think it 's hath .
And I think it 's even dangerous and I don 't want to see the perpetuated in the next century .
I think it 's better encourage our great creative minds .
And I know that , in my case -- in my case -- it would be very dangerous start to fix that I was dark about the suppose , most of it is in my career .
That 's true -- you know , you 're looking at , I 'm pretty young , I have about 40 years .
I still have about four decades of work in me .
And it 's really likely that whatever I 'm going to be judated from the world as the work that I did after spent spending him after my book .
I 'm going to be slavery , because we 're all more or love here -- it 's likely to my own success is my best success is my walked .
Oh , Gesus , who thought !
You know this is the gender of thinking that leads a person to start gone in the morning and I don 't want to do it .
I would ster continue to continue to do this work that we love .
So , the question is , how to be ?
And so it seems , after many reflections , that the way to work to continue to write a psychological costruction , OK ?
I have to find a search distance of security between me , which I 'm writing , and my natural anxiety on which is going to be able to get . And , as I was trying to find it . And , as I was looking through the time , trying to find other society to see if they could have a better ideas and sane .
in how to help people create creative to management the inerent emotional risks of creativity .
And that search has taken me to the ancient Great and ancient .
Sewitem because I go back .
In the ancient Great and ancient -- people didn 't seem to believe that creativity was not believing that creativity was from men , OK ?
He was thinking that creativity was this spirit look at divine and that was going to be tackilling and unknown , for distant distant and unknown .
The greenhouse called these spirits of creativity of creativity .
Sococrate , wonderful , he created to have a demon that elargives wisdom from away .
The Roomands were the same idea , but they called that kind of spirit .
which is great , because the Romanian didn 't really think that a genius was someone particularly intelligent .
They realized that a genius was this kind of entities that created a living in the walls of a artist , a little bit like the Dobby , and that was a little like the Dobby , and that was out of the artist of the work and pattern of that work .
It 's a nurture -- here is the distance of which I talk about -- that psychological construct you from the results of your work .
And everybody knew that was that it was that it worked , right ?
So the anti-to-to-certain artists , as the way , for example , too narcism , right ?
If your work was excited about it , you could not take all the deserve , all knew that they had been helped by this genius .
If your failure work , it wasn 't all your own , right ?
Everybody knew that was your genius to be a .
And so people han conceived creativity in Wcident for a long time .
Then Rinascivvvvance came and everything , and I was born this big idea ; we put the human being at the center of the universe and misters and more without leaving space to the misters and more creatures to write space .
This was the major of humanity and people began to think that creativity was completely by the ished .
And for the first time in history , I started to refer this or that artist as a genius as a genius that 's kind of a person with genius .
And I have to tell you , I think that was a big error .
I think that allow someone , a simple person to believe as a recipient as a recipient , and the surgery of all divines , creative , inosconnected , inosconcible , inosconnected , inosconnected to the fragile psychchchches .
It 's like to be able to get sun .
Deform and distores completely the ego and creates all of these inextremendous welling on the performance .
And I think it was this at address the artists in the past 500 years .
And if that 's true , and I think it 's true , and now ?
Can we do it different ?
Maybe back to a more ancient understanding of the relationship between humans and creative .
Or maybe it 's not .
Maybe we can 't sell 500 years of rational thinking in a talk of 18 minutes .
And there is probably people between the audience that would be reading in the public notion of scientific notion , insum , you do people who are follow or by the way .
Probably not to convince you all of this .
But the question I 'd like to take is -- why isn 't it ?
Why is not thinking about that way ?
Because it 's more sense of everything that I 've ever heard to explain the exasperformance of the process of creative process .
A process that , as anyone who I 've ever been trying to do something -- so , basically , everyone here -- it doesn 't buy rationally .
And , in fact , it can be completely paranormal looks completely paranormal .
I did this meeting recently with the extraordinary poetesh Ruth Stone , who has been a poetesh for all life and told me that was a poetesse for the greenhouse , working out in the Virginia , working out in Virginia , and when a poem was in the ground .
He told me that he was like a fragorous air .
And that was going to be rotating to her from landscape .
He was hearing it , because he was so much to be able to be .
He had to have one thing to do at that point and it was about , words , and he was , " it 's going to be . "
And so it was going to house and come up with this poem , and it wouldn 't have to make it a piece of paper and a match and a match fast , while the trapp was , while the trapp , and he would stand to pay it on the page .
Sometimes he couldn 't fast , so it was fastern and run without able to get into home and poetry . And she was rotles through and she would keep it through and her perden , and he would keep into the landscape , as she said , " another poet . "
Then there were those times -- this piece piece of time -- there were moments where it was almost losing , right ?
So , he was running up at home and he was looking for the card and the poem was going through , and he was a washed by , and then he said , that was like , and he said , that was like he sleep with the hand and the step .
He was the poem from the tail and he was put it in his body and turned it in his body and turned it on page .
And in these cases , the poem would be presented on the perfect page and it 's going to the last word .
So when I thought , I was a bit of it -- it 's a crazy , it 's exactly equal to my creative .
Not all my process creative process -- I 'm not a condition .
I 'm a mule , and my way to work is , and my way to work is ; you wake up and go and go and go and go and go and go and go and go and go and go and go and go and go and go and go and go and go and go and go and go and go and go and go and go and go and go and go and go and go and go and go and go and go and go and go and go and go and go and go and go and go and go and go and go and go and go and go and go and go and go and go and go and go and go and go and go and go and go and go and go
But even I have , in my head , I brought against that thing , at times .
And I think that 's also a lot of you do that .
You know , even though the work and ideas were giving me from a certain source I could not honestly .
What is that ?
And how can we relate to it to it , but , how can 't do you test the head , but , rather , what does it remain ?
So , as I 'm the best example of a contemporary example I have is the Tom Waits , which I interviewed a different years ago for a newspaper .
We were talking about this , and you know , Tom , for most of life was the incarnation of the artist of the artist went back , contemporary , trying to control , and trying to control , and to control , dominate these species of creative totally interized .
But then I invent , he turned , and one day as he was driving on a car in Los Angeles , changed everything for him .
He was going to go fast and all of a trackle tracking this small framment of makes , which is inspiration in his heads like inspiration , elusive , and it wants , you know , it 's wonderful , and it doesn 't know how to take it .
It 's not a piece of paper , it has not a mathemath , it has not a recording .
So , he begins to feel this kind of old anxiety growing in him , " I 'm going to lose , and I 'll stand burn it from this song .
I 'm not good enough and I can 't do it . "
And instead of going to go in the panic , he stopped .
I 'm going to be the whole process of mental .
I 'm going to just look at the sky and said , " Don 't see that I 'm driving ? "
" Do you look like that can write a song ?
If you really want to be , back to a moment more open when I can take care of you .
About , you go to important to something today .
You 're going to disturbing Leonard Cohen . "
And his process , he was working changed after that .
Not the work , it was still dark like .
But the process , and the fish that was that attended when the genius , the genius that was caused when the genius , he was cut out and fliberate it back where problems and liberate it back where it was , by doing that it didn 't be an interized and turned .
but it 's really , that 's a beautiful burst , beautiful collaboration a conversation between Tom and this strange , and this strange , and external thing that was not Tom .
So , as the story I was changing a little bit of the way I worked and I was saved .
This idea , I was going to writing " Manogy , Prega , Ama , and cadd , Ama , and fall in one of those cave that we 're working on something and we can 't start to think that it 's going to be a disaster , which is going to be a disaster , which is going to be the worst , which is going to write .
Not only bad , just the worst books .
And I started thinking about gone this project .
But then I remember in Tom who was talking about air and I tried to it .
So I got my face in the face of the handing and I recognize my commments to a vacuum .
And I said , " Do you know , " You know , what , you both know that if this book is not going to be interacted with my , no ?
Because as I see there , I 'm paying all I have , I don 't have .
So if you want it to be better , you have to present , and do your part .
OK . But if you don 't do it , you know what , I don 't do .
I 'm going to write the same because it 's my work .
And I 'd like to please that I 'm now presented to do my part of doing my part of the North , and it 's like this -- secoli ago in the deserts of North people were suncle for the clear , dances and the hours of the midd-hours and hours .
And they were always magnific , because the balleras was professionals and they were wonderful .
But every one of them , rarely , something happened , and one of these artists was actually transpendent .
And I know that you know what I talk about , because I know you 've seen it , at a certain point , a performance .
It was like the time stopped , and the ballery walked through a kind of bring , and it didn 't do anything else from the usually , as 1,000 nights before , but everything was smoking down .
And suddenly not appeared as a human .
But it turns out to the diinside and under the fire of divinity .
And when this was happening , at the time , people knew what they called it .
They knew the hands and began to cancer , Allah , Allah , Allah , God , God , " God . "
That 's God , you know .
Curious storytellical -- when the Mororororthern the South , I took this habitude with their and pronunce changed in the coli . And Allah , Allah , Allah , Allah , Allah , " " " Ole , " which , " which you can hear in the round .
In Spain , when a artist has done something that impossible and magic , " Allah , the word , well , Allah , burn , burn , bury , " incomprehensive , " incomprehensive ,
And it 's great because we need it .
But the problem is the day after , for the dance , when you wake up and discovering that are the 11 morning of Martedyes , and I wouldn 't have .
It 's just a wort-walking mortal with ginoccurs , and maybe it will never be able to listen to that allow it .
And maybe nobody site God 's name God still while it 's going to do with her life ?
It 's hard .
This is one of the most pain that is a creative life .
But maybe it has to be so angot-to be so angot-up if you can 't believe , the most extraordinary aspects of your being from you .
But you just believe that they 're going to be a furniture from an inimaginable source of this source of your life that you have to have to go to someone else .
And , you know , if we think about that it 's changing .
And so I started thinking about , and it 's certainly as I thought , for a different months during the workplace that I 'm going to published , spent , spent , spent , spent , spent , I was going to follow my great success .
And what I have to continue to tell me when I feel elected by this is , not aver .
Don 't go . It 's just your work .
It 's involues to introduce your part , whatever .
If your work is balling , bad at the ball .
If the divine , lisurd genius to make decide to let up wind a few kind of wonderful , for one moment through your efforts , then , " So ! "
Otherwise , do the same your dance .
And " Ole ! " Ole ! "
I think I think it 's got to teach it .
" Ole ! " at yourself , even only for having love and humans touch to make you continuous .
Thank you .
Thank you .
June Cohen : Ole !
You know , as you know I 've been talking about some of these projects on the human genome , what it can mean to meaning and the discovery of genes .
Now we 're starting a new way : we started digitalizing biology and now from that digital code we 're entering in a new phases , we 're entering in a new phases .
We 've always been trying to bring big questions .
" What is life ? " is something that many biologists I think they have a tented to understand livels .
We tried different approaches , reduced to the minimal terms .
We 're digitalizing from almost 20 years .
When we sequenced the human genome was treating from the analogical world of the computer in the digital world .
Now , let 's ask we can regenerate life , or create new from this digital universe ?
This is the map of a small organism , Mycoplasma genitalium , which is the species from the smallest genitalium that can autoreum in the lab .
And we tried to reduce ulteriorable genome to create one more small .
We 're able to eliminate a hundred gene of the 500 that I 'm here .
But when we look at her metabolic map , it 's relatively simple respect to our .
I retremendous , that 's simple .
But when we look at all the genes that we can eliminate , one at the time , it 's very unliving that this can bring a living cellent .
So we decided that the only way to make this synthesize that was synthesize this cromosome to modify components to bring some of these fundamental questions .
So , we started the adventure of " Can we can synthetize a cromosoma ? "
Can it 's a chemistry to produce these big molecules that we never have been able to create before ?
And , in case , can we have a cromosoma ?
A cromosoma is simply a piece of chemist of chemist .
The speakers that we 're able to digitalize life is growing to the exponential .
Our ability to write the genetic code , instead , rather slowly , but it 's improving .
And our most recent recently , the more recently of the exponential .
We started over 15 years ago .
The process was required a lot of pass , beginning with a bioetic review before we began to start .
But we found that that DNA is very hard .
There are tens of thousand machines in the world that make small segments of DNA , of long , of long , and it 's a process : more the segment is a degenerative process : more than the segment is , more errors .
So we had to develop a new method to assemble these fragments and running the errockets .
And this was our first attempt , to start digital information , to start digital information genome .
It 's a small virus that kills kills .
We designed the fragments , effectively the correction of errors and get a molecule of DNA , about 5,000 letters .
The interesting part is when we took this piece of chemistry of chemist and we put it in the bacteria , the bacteria have started read this genetic code and project the particles .
The viral particles have been reflip by cells , are back and they destroy back and they destroy the E. coli .
I 've been talking about recently with membrals of oil industry and they have certainly compressed that model .
They have more than you .
We believe that this is a situation where the software can actually build the same hardware in a biological system .
But we wanted to do things in larger .
We wanted to build the whole cromosom of the bacteria .
I 'm over 580 mila letters of genetic code .
So we thought we 'd build it in casses of the virus , so that we could change the casses to understand what the components of a living cells .
The design is crucial , and if we start with digital information in a computer , these have to be very accurate .
When we sequency this genome for the first time in 1995 , the standard accuratence was a mile for every 10 miles .
We found , resequency , 30 errors . If we had used that original sequence . We never had been able to be able to do it .
One part of the process is designing 50 letters that are overwhelming that is overwhelming with all the other segments of 50 letters to be able to work together .
We try to elements the only here .
You have a little bit of you put that we put in the filiguring .
So , think it 's like this : we have a genetic code on four letters : A , C , Gs and T.
Three of those letters together codificate about 20 minoacids , and there 's a specific order of reading for every amount .
So we can use genetic code to write words , framework , framework , framework , framework , framework , frame , framework , framework , framework , frame , framework , frame , framework , frame , framework , framework , frame , framework , frame , framework
What we 've done in the beginning was autography .
Some of them were used by the fact that it wouldn 't be poetry .
We designed these segments to just to be simply to unend them with enzymes .
There are enzymes that are repair them and put them up .
And we started assemble to assemble parts , beginning with five to seven miles , and we have to have a seven miles , to make a segment of 24 mile letters .
We have made these things in abundance , so we have made these into abundance so that we 're trying to create a very very , very , very , very , very , very , as you 'll see in a minute .
We 're looking for automatizing the process .
So , this seems the tabellon a basket .
When we get to these very long segments , more than 100 miles , more than 100 miles , they 're not growing more directly in the E. coli .
It comes to the limit of the molecular biology of the molecular biology .
So we looked at other mechanisms .
We knew , we knew , a mechanism called recombination , which in biology to repair the DNA that can use the DNA can to bring the segment .
Here 's an example .
This organism , called Deinococcus radiococcus , it can absorbing three million rads .
You can see in the superior like his romosoma is going to destruct .
In 12 hours -- 24 hours is reassembled exactly as it was before .
There 's thousands of organisms that are able to do that .
These organisms can be completely search .
They can live under a vacuum .
They 're absolutely certainly the space , and you move to find new environments of water .
In fact , NASA , he showed that this is .
This is a picture of the molecule that we built these processes , simply using the labeled design of the segments to insert .
The least lies it takes them automatically .
This image was not taken with a microscope , but with a microscope , but with a microscope .
It 's a lot of that we can see it with a microscope that we can see it with a law .
These are pictures that cover a period of about six seconds .
This is the public we 've done a little time ago .
I 'm over 580,000 letters of genetic code .
It 's the largest molecule of a definitely defined structure .
It has a molecular weight to 300 million .
If we stand with a caratter 10 without spaces , they would like 142 pages , they would like 142 pages to transform this genetic code .
Now , how do we do that ? How can we activate it ?
Obviously , likely , a virus is a game .
It 's a little more complicated when they use .
It 's easier . It 's also as ekariote as our -- you can just extract the nucleus and put a whole thing in it , which is basically the process of clonation .
In the bacteria , the cromosoma is integrated inside to the cell , but we have recently demonstrated that we 're able to do a transplant , from a cell to another and activity .
We can have a cromosoma starting from a microbial species .
The two are different men as the men from the topi .
We have added a few gene that we could decide what choose to choose for this cromosome .
And then the holds with the ends in a way that we kill all proteins .
And when we put it in the cells was stupendent -- and you 're going to oppreciate our sophisticatogist -- the new cromosoma was going into the cells .
And we were we couldn 't go beyond , but we tried to spend , but we 've tried to spend .
This is one of the major mechanisms .
We found that so many , a lot of add , and I 've recognized a second or a third of new tracks , in a second thousands of tracts .
So who think about evolution as only gene that 's a gene that it 's not understood a lot of biology .
There 's a true of restriped restriped that to make digery digit , they 're going to digm digm .
The cromosoma that was in the cells don 't have one .
The cell phone that we have inserit-cell .
And it 's expressed , and he recognized the other cromosome as a material , and he 's got it , and we were returned with only the cells and the new cromosome .
it blue because of the gene we 've been inserious .
And in a short leaving of time , all the characteristics of a species have been going to be , and it turned out to a new species , based on the new software that we put in the cells .
All protein is changed , and when we read , and when we read the genetic code of the equivalent to the exactly that we 've been transfer .
Now , this might look at alchemy genetics , but it 's high DNA , we can change things in manier . We can change things in a way enough fundamental .
Now , I 've already explained that there 's not a genetis -- but we 've been progress from three and a half million years and a half years of evolution , and I said that maybe we 're going to create a new version of the Cambrian explosion of the species that are going to be created in the digital process .
Why do that ?
I think it 's obvious , when we think about our necessity .
We 're going to go from six and a half billion people in the next 40 years .
Right for example : I was born in 1946 .
Now there are three people on the planet for each other in 1946 ; there 's been four .
We 're going to find out food , fresh water and clean water and clean , medical and gets and gets for six billion and a half billion people .
It will be more driven to it for nine billion .
We use more than five billion carbon carbon , more than 30 billion baries of oil .
That means millions of baries a day .
When we try to find biological processes , or whatever we try to figure them , it 's going to be a huge challenge .
We have to hold all of the CO2 of these things from the hemixture that end in the atmosphere .
At day , thank you to scientific discovery that in all world , we have a database with about 20 million genes , and I like to think that are designed for the future .
The electronics industry only only , a dozen of components , and think about how many different things came out .
Our limits here is a biological data from the biological reality and our imagination .
Now we have techniques , thank you , because of the rapid synthesization , we call genomics fighting .
We 're able to build a big robot that can produce a million cromosomes a day .
Think of processing these 20 million different genes or to try to get optimize the processes of processes or , new vaccines , and we can change , thank , and create more biology , and create more and create more and create more biology molecular biology .
And it 's simply a standard selection .
We can choose for survival , chemical production , chemical or or fuel , production of vaccines .
This is an instantaneous instantanished by a lot of program that we 're working for being able to seat and design species to computers .
Well , we don 't know how they 're going to be .
We know exactly what their genetic code .
Now we 're concentrating on the fuel of the generation .
You 've seen you that experiment from the grate was a bad experiment .
We have a second of second and third generation that will use enough to be surrounds of more than the high value as optankly .
But the only way biology that can have a great impact of having a great impact of food and limitarne of the food and limitarne limited disponity to be transforming CO2 in matter , and we 're working with cellustration that can be add this , and we think we could have a purpose to this , and we think of the first generation in about 18 months .
The light sunlight sunlight -- but in our discoveries -- but in our discoveries all over the world , we found different metods .
This is an organism that we 've described in 1996 .
It 's in the deep ocean , about 2500 feet of deep-deep-deep-water .
They reat the meter CO2 , using hydrogen , like a source of energy .
We 're trying to understand whether we can figure out CO2 , which can be easily be transported by your tubes , convert that CO2 in carburon , to drive this process .
So , we think we might be able to increase what we can increase the question that the basis of life is , " We have the real , versus -- we have the mod-obic , and we have the goal of oil .
Extaken . If you can 't do it from TED , where can you ?
It would be a main source .
And we 're working on using the same metods to create vaccines .
You see this year with the influence , we 're always back in a year and with a dollar in less when it 's find the wine is going to find the right .
I think that that 's going to change building vaccination in a very hard .
So , this is how the future could start to look at changing , the evolution of evolution , accelerating the evolution with bacteria , arches , archadies , and finally finally cellue eucariote .
We 're so much from the best people .
Our purpose is to be able to live enough to try to do it . Thank you very much . Thank you very much .
First of all I 'll show you , the most rapidly possible , some fundamental work , of new technology that we took to Microsoft , which we took to be following in the way , almost a year ago ago exactly . This is Seadragon .
It 's a environment that you can interact is in the local level that remote with a huge amount of data .
Here we 're looking at a lot of gabyte of digital photos with a kind of zoom and continue , for a sandscape , disponing the images we want .
And it doesn 't matter how big amount of information that we see , how big these are garming data or images .
Most of them are common digital photographs , but this is a scanning scan from the Biooooo of Congresentertained , and reentertained in the game of 300 megapixel .
It 's not a difference because the only thing that limits prestations of a system like this is the number of playing on your screen on your screen in any moment . It 's also a very flexible architecture .
This is a whole book , example of data doesn 't images .
This is the Casa desolate of Dickens . Every colonna represents a chapter .
So , to show you that it 's about textbook and not imagery , we can do something like that , to make a real thing that is a real representation of the textbook , not a picture .
It could be a little bit of artificial to read a book .
It 's not a advice .
This is a more realistic example . It 's an example of the Guardian .
Every big picture is the beginning of a section .
And it really gives you really have the pleasure of reading the experience of a review of a revision or a quotidian , which is for nature a moltice .
We also did something with the angle of this particular , in the Guardian .
We created a higher ads higher resolutionary -- much more high than that is using a normal . And we put in a normal . And we put it in the extra .
If you want to see the characteristics of this automobile , you can see here .
Or other models , or even the specific specific specific patterns .
And this really demonstrates some of these ideas to eliminate the limits of space on the screen .
We hope that that means means to put in the site and up with other downnery and other pop-up cheries , not have to be necessary .
Of course , mapping is one of the most obvious applications for this kind of technology .
And on this is not want to lose time , if we don 't have contributing that we have contributing in this field .
These are all the streets in the U.S. .
So , we 're going to go to something else .
This is now actually , from the web on the web ; you can go to the web ; you can see it .
It 's a project called Photosynth , which combine two different technologies .
A is Seadragon and the other is a visual search a very interesting research on that in Noah Snavority , a student of the University of Washington , with Steve Szeliski .
And it 's from Seadragon , gestite by Seadragon .
You can see it when we do this kind of pattern , where we can go from a image to the other and have this kind of experience and have this kind of experience .
But the space space of the images here has actually a meaning meaning .
The algorites of visualization of computing , so that they running these images together , so that they running to the real place in which the imintext images -- all of the Grases on Montagagne Rococtops -- they 're taking up . And so you see the elements of a lif-stable shop . And so , you see the elements of a sances of a slightly .
I don 't know if I have time to show you some other environment .
There are a lot more space .
I want to go to one of the original data of Noahhhholding -- and this is from a prototype of Photosynth that we 've done for the first time , the extremely scorsis , the technology behind , Photosyth , and the Photosyth , and it 's not necessarily extraordinary looking at the environments that we 've been put in the website .
We had to worry about the legal things and forward .
This is a rebuilding of the catthedral chthedral Dame . Baast : Baast digitar . Baast , and you get images of the types of the other campaibs and get images of these arancions , other campus and so on . One of these arcions , the image that it 's discovered a picture that model .
So they 're all images from Flickr and they were all connected to this way .
And it 's possible to navigate this way simple .
You know , I 'd never have thought about it to work for Microsoft .
It 's very gratifying to remember this kind of accountries here .
I think you can see that it 's a lot of different types of different types of different phone of the phone to the phone , SLR , a meaning number of meaning , and it was meaning together in this environment .
And if I can , I 'm going to try to look for those strange .
A lot of them are block , etc .
On some part here is a series of photographs -- here .
This is a Notre poster Dame recorrectly .
We can go from the poster to the vision of this environment .
The essential point is that we can do things with social environment . This is now taking data from the college of the college of how the land , from a vision of view -- and connected all of these data .
All those pictures become colleaged , more than the som of the parts .
You have a model of the land that looks like .
You think about this as a proling of Stephen Lawler 's work on Earth .
It 's something that grows in complexity as complexity , and the people who are going to use , and the advantages for the use .
Their pictures are huses with inseries from other people .
If someone is the idea of the idea of the idea of the name , my name , my photo of the chthedral of Notre Dame sudden of all that data , and I can use it as a point of of engineer in that space , in that metaphing the space , in that metaphing the space , and have a social experience of cross-moot-mo-from social cross-mobile photo-mobile photo .
Of course , a consequence of this is virtual model of any interesting patterns of each other interesting , collapse of any plants of satellite and satellite images and satellitarians and similar , but from the college of college .
Thank you very much .
CA : I understand ? What your software is that your software will connect us to do is that a point , in the next few years , all the photographs , all the photographs , all the time will be almost accountioning together ?
BAA : Yeah . What it 's doing in practice is discover .
It 's creating hyperlink , if you want , you want , between images .
And it 's doing it in the basis on the content of images .
The thing is becomes very interesting if you think about the seats of semantic information that a lot of these images .
As when you 're doing a research of images on the web , and the text on the web pattern and the textbook on the web .
Now , what if that is that picture is connecting all your picture ?
So the amount of interconnection and semantic interconnection and the amount of recognize that is really huge . It 's a classic effect of the network .
CA : Blaise , it 's really incredible .
BAA : I thank you very much .
One of the main pileap when you travel and one of the core of the research search is the power of living between who didn 't forget the anti-traditions , between who have the past , the past in the touch , driver in the pleter , driven in the pletkey , driving in the plants .
Basti think that Jaguar travel even beyond the Via Lattea , or that mits of the old Inuit are still college , or that in Himalayas , the good people are still in the Dharm , to remember the importance of Dharma , to remember the importance of the Dharma , and that the idea that the world that we live in absolute , but it 's just a model ,
the consequence of a particular set of choices that our own styes has done , good or bad , a lot of generations ago .
And , of course , we all share of the essential tracts .
All we do . All we try .
We are subjects to start .
We have to deal with inesorability of death , so we don 't surprising and whether we 're going to be able to take and ballize --
We all have art .
What hits is the particular song , the phone of the song , the dance of every culture .
It doesn 't matter that they 're the think of the Borneo , or the following of Haiti , or the Haiti , or the guerriers of the Kaisut in Kenya Stentries , or a camp in the Curmmury , or a camp in Sahara .
He was my journey of journey in the desert a month ago , or a yak of the gap in the valley of the Everest , the dea mother of the world .
All of these populations teachers teaching there are other ways of existing , other ways of thinking , other ways of model in the world .
And if you reflect a second , it 's a concept that can give you hope .
Insise , the mirist cultures of the world creating a spiritual life and cultural that we have volunteer and cultural that 's important to well-being on the planet as the ragela .
And you can think about this cultural ragela and you can call the ethnosis and can defining the ethnosatic , the total , dreams , inspiration , ideas , inspiration , inspiration , inspiration , inspiration , inspiration , inspiration , inspiration , inspiration ,
The etnosfhere is the patrimony of humanity .
It 's the symbbol of what we 're and what we can be in how we can be in how species .
And because the biosphere was free , by by the beautiful ethnosal had been successful at etnosh and purthnosed .
None biologist , for example , that 50 percent of all species was or is on the orge of the species was not going to have a handle of biological diversity -- in the most optimistic diversity -- and not have close to be advanced close to hypothesis -- that we can 't have close to -- that 's a little bit more optimistic .
The indes of that is , of course , the language of the language .
When you 're born there were 6,000 languages on this planet .
A language is not only by a vocabulary or from a vocabulary rules .
A language is the sprazy of human spirit .
It 's the middle of which the animal is going to be in the material world .
Every language is a forest of the mind , a back-mind , a thought , a hand-a-a-chance .
And of those 6,000 languages , while we sat Monterey , at least half is not surt in the ears of children .
They don 't come more teached to children , which means , unless you wouldn 't be in the way , which is already death .
What is there more sad than being able to have a silence , of being the last to talk to a languages , not have to have a language of admit , or a promission of children or ananticipate the promission of children ?
This is a falong was a few of a world of a world in some of the world every two weeks : every two weeks , a old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old old ,
And I know someone of you say , " Isn 't it ?
The world would not be a better place if we 're going to talk about all the same language ? " Well , then , we talk about the yoruba .
Let 's talk kogi .
You 'll find a tracker of what it means not to talk .
I 'd like to do you like to do a journey through the etnosat --
a little journey in the etnosh to give you a assage of what we 're losing .
Many of us forget that when I say , " different ways of existing really different ways of existing . "
Let 's take for example , this books in Amazon , Amazon , the popular popular saconto , who creating the myth of the latte of the sandard of the sandard of sacred .
It 's a popular popular that 's not able to be able to distinguish the blue because it 's time for the forest , which is identified in the forest , whose popular .
They have a strange language and a regle , detected , " " You have to move a language , " You have to move a different person who talk a different language .
All that radical in the past , such a lot of the partnership is that in these families that are talking about six or languages that are talking about six or seven languages .
They 're limit to listen and then start talking .
Let 's take one of the most interesting tribes that I lived , the Waorani Waorani , a popular popular , a popular popular who had the first contacts in 1958 .
In 1957 , five missionary missionary they had a common a factor .
They did it write from the high photographed them in a few who were in a very populating , forest that this populating populating that this population population had never seen .
They have gone picture from the ground , they turned to the research of a form or a figure and , not find nothing , they had concluded that they were attacking the dishes , and they killed the five missionary with the lance .
But the Waorani didn 't only killed the straneiers .
They killed with them .
54 percent of the mortality was caused by their same .
We 're risking at eight generations and we found two cases of natural death and when we had had been involved to know , they had a lot of them who was invected , and then they had a killing of them . And they had a huge knowledge . And they had a very incredible knowledge of the forest .
The cunters were able to recognize the animal from 40 steps and recognize the species .
In the early ' 80s , I was assigned a very interesting task when my professor of Harvard asked me if I wanted to go to Harvard to intruly intruly , in the base of Duvalier , and impossessing me in the mix-Duvalier used to do the zombic zobies .
So , to give a sense of miracology , I had to understand the Vodoun culture , and Vodouldn 't be magic .
It 's pretty much of complex complex vision of the world .
Very interesting .
If I ask you to tell me the big religions of the world , what would you say ?
Christianesimum , Islam , Buddism , Ebraism , etc .
A continent is always left out , thinking that the sub-Saharan Africa has not been religious . And instead of , and Voodoo , and Vodoo , is not that the distilled by these religious concepts of these religious concepts of these religious , we have wait .
What makes the voice is the intense relationship between life and death .
So , you know , you know , you know , the way .
The spirits can be invited by the Great Acqua , respected to the replace of the dance and replace in the anim of vision that for a short that for a short across the way that for a short accountries to be the goal .
So , the voodooists are love to talk about God .
We say in the temple and diving God . "
And from the moment you 're going to be , is the spirit that you 're driving you , how can you do it ?
So you 're looking at these incredible events : following voodoor in the state of trance that touch a demonstration that touch a demonstration that you could be able to be in the body when it 's catalyzed in a state of extreme .
And the popular that I lived the most extraordinary of the most extraordinary is Kogi Sierra Nevada de Sierra Marta , in Colombia sector in the Colombia .
Tell phancivilization that once had lived on the planning of Colombic , in the attention of the conquister , the population was the population of the maintain , the population was going to the massive plug .
In a continent mackicked , this popular , this popular was never conquered by the spagnology .
And now , they have a clero , but their formation is actually extraordinary .
The young people following out from families to three or four years , and they live secregated in a world that 's made of a good sharing and homes in the base of the ice of the ice of the ice for 18 years .
Two period of nine years , I proposed to reproduce the nine months of gestation that turn in the mother , are now metaphor , are now metaphor in the user of Great Mther .
So , that 's all of time , they come accultural values , values that they predicted their predicted and only their predicted and their predict to maintain the cost ecological ecological .
At term of this incredible began , starting , suddenly brought and for the first time in their lives , at the age of 18 years , they see a high . And in that accountery , when the sun of the beautiful ckety , when the sun of the beautiful pattern , everything they learned in a theory of the beautiful landscape . The predict does it comes to . The precisely . The prevous thing , when the pattern of the behind is a past . The prevention the ground , when the ground , when it 's been been been been been been been been been been been been been been been been been been been a behouse
" I 'm going to do like , I said .
It 's stupendent . Now it 's to you protect it . "
It 's called them larger brothers and say that we , brothers , we 're the colpatterns of destruction of the world .
This is intuition is extremely important .
When we think of the indeed populations and environment we think the Resau and old history of the noble wild , which is a razy in his simplicity or perhaps in the simplicity or perhaps we say that these populations are closer to the Earth .
The indeed popular indeed is nor indeed by the no-stalogy .
There 's no space for these things in the paluds of the Astpalues or the gelids of Tibet , but thank you at the time and , created a mistic Earth 's based on the concept of being knowledge . But in a more such . But the concept that the Earth can only live in the world .
What does it mean ?
He means that a kid of the Ande that grows of Ande that grows the mountain is a spirit . Apu that will drive his destiny different and will have a destiny different , and it will have a fun of different relationship with the mountain or that place in Montana or that place .
That 's the dimtaining or a mineral car was irrifying .
What 's interesting is metaphor that defines the define is the meaning between the individual and the natural world .
I grew up in the forests of Columbia Britannica credating that the forests served to be cut .
And that 's made me a human being else from my friends Kwakiutl who believe that the forestimate Hukuk and the behind of the paradise and the stories of paradise and the down-handnorth of cannight and the downnorth of the world , explaining in the beginning .
If you start to look at that these cultures can create different reality , you can start understand some of their sensational discoveries . We take this plants .
I took this picture to open in the northern Amazon Amazon .
Maybe some of you have heard of the ayahuash , the most powerful such of the sciamanic repertoire .
What makes the plateuashuash is not the physical potential of the sustainance , but her elaboration . It 's composed by two elements .
From a late , this lean legacy that contains a series of radius , harmine and harmine , slightly hallucinogenes .
Take the only plant is a plant fire that alters a little bit that it 's a little consciousness , but it 's michoices with the leaves of a coffee , Psychotria redis .
This is a plant contains sad , very similar to serothyltryltryltrypamine-five , methoxyltrypamine .
If you 've ever see Yanomami . And if you 're going to see the nass that they make a different set of species , anched methoxyltrypamine .
As it in the nurse is a little bit like being disappeared by a fire smoke from a depints of debate bar and landing on a mand pin a destand pink on a destortion of reality .
I often often with my professor , Richard Evan Shultes , the man who took the man who took the psychedelic , with her discovery of the fungi in Mexico .
I think it can 't be able to classified these triptamine like hallucinogens because if you 're not going to tell anybody of being told . [ But you can 't tell anybody to be hallucinated . And I can 't be assumptiny because they 're money from a hallucin-oxior , and it 's a monoamin-oxior monoamin-oxior .
It 's possible to absuit , if you 're just a taking of chemicals that money in MAs . Or .
Now , it 's beautiful : People who are in this liana are injudge of MAs , the same kind of need to be able to be able to be able to be triptamine . The question is spontaneous question : in a four-crazy , like these popular popular , but if you fight this , they 're not , but that if you fight this , they 're not going to that , create a biochemical version of parts ?
We use the great eulililife-proof the proof and error , which can reveal .
But if we ask the Indian , they 'll tell us , " The plants talk . "
What does it mean ?
This tribes , the Cofan , has 17 varieties of ayahuash , who are despite in the forest , and that our eyes would be going to be in the same species .
If we asked him how they stuck their tasonomics will tell us , " I thought of plants , you know , plants don 't know everything ? " I said , " No . "
The solution is : you take 17 variety in a night of lunder the moon and each night with a different .
With this is not slaugh to Harvard , but it 's much more interesting that to contate the stami stami .
Now , [ we opping ] the problem is that also the ones that have heart people who have heart the indeed population them , but in some way you can redotts , but in some way .
In fact , the 20th century , between 300 years , it will not remember for his wars or the technologies , but it was rather like the time we were stopped and we have been used to huge and we have huge or accepted destruction of the biological diversity of biological diversity and cultural cultural diversity .
All the cultures through the sects have been involved in a dance for new life .
And the problem is not technology .
The Indians Sioux didn 't stop being Sioux when they put from a part of the ark and fit as Americans have no stopped to be Americans when they didn 't stop be . when they 're part of Americans when they have a candal and calculations .
It 's not the change or technology that threatening integrity . It 's the power . It 's the power .
The domination of domination .
And if you give a look at the world , you 'll find that these are not cultures .
They 're living and dynamics and dynamics that existence from identify forces that are beyond their ability to adaptation .
Which is that it 's disboxed in the patria of the thinking --
a popular no----asian popular , in the asian popular who lived free in the forest to a generation , and now reduced to the service , and now reduced to the service of the rive , where you can see the river of the rive , where you can see the river that looks at the Meriday . Borneo Meriday , where the Meridic Cinese , where the Meridionce , where the horizonesseems to the Merian .
it takes up to fit up with the wood wood .
Or , the Yanomami , in the case of Yanomami , are the disease that are coming with the discovery of those .
If we move on the Tibet , where I 'm doing a lot of research , you 'll see the during political domination .
As you know the genocide , the physical extinction of a popular , it 's condent at universal , but the ethnocide , destruction of a popular popular , not only is condition , but it 's not only not only condent , but it 's a buron , because it 's part of the development .
And you can 't understand the subsidize of Tibet until you 're not part of the Tibet .
I lost the 6,000 miles from China in China in China in the West through Tibet , coming to Lhasa with a young colleaguous , but only came to Lhasa , I realized what we have is there is behind in .
6,000 sacres sacres in polling and cencounters .
1.2 million people killed by the military Cultural Rivolution .
The father of this guy was ascritical at the Panchen Lama .
which means it was killed to the template of Chinese .
His uncle smoke with Santity in Santity that he 's taken the popular that 's popular popular .
His mother was impresoned and her colcolpattern was recognize .
It was brought to a carrying in the age of two years borders under his gonna because he could not live with him .
The sister , who did the same , was in a field of reeducation .
One day has been walked up a stand-up a raffering raffering Mao and , to this transgression , was put the properly for seven years .
The Tibet can be insuit can be insuit , but it reside the reside of the popular is from popular .
As the end , all of it reduce it to a choice .
We want to live in the world monocromatic or we want to accomplished the world 's policicromal .
The great anthropologist Margaret Mead , before he died her biggest fear was that , in our go to this vision of the world , we 're not only going to see the whole gamm of human imagination , but one day we will be wake up from a swake up to a swake up from a sonor .
And it 's easy for 60,000 years .
The Neolitical Rvolution , who given us the agriculture , who did fighting us to the seed cult , replacing the poem of the sciences of the sler , creating the poem of the specialization , and we talk about 10,000 years ago .
The modern industrialized world has been 300 years .
That seems that we have the answers that we have the answers that we have to all the challenges that we have to deal with the millennery to come .
When these miric cultures is the world is asked what it means to be human , they say , they say with 10,000 different voices .
And it 's in these answers that we 're all rising the chance of being what we 're : a consciously conscious , that has to make all population , and all the garden can fiort . And there 's great moments of optimism .
I took this picture on the northern extremely in the island of Baffin , when I went to hunting the hunting of the hunting , Olaya , Olaya , he told me the wonderful story of her grandfather .
The government canadly was not always gentle with the Inuit and in the ' 50s to stand in the ' 50 to stand use our surface , we have running them .
The grandfather of this man refurther .
The family , I temention , I was a family , and all his own reacties .
You have to know that Inuit doesn 't teach cold , they tein .
The Saxis in origin were origin were made of fish have flip in skin skin .
The grandfather was not intimise from the arctic night or the libraries that was suffering .
It 's gap away , it 's hot the pantalone bits in skin skin in and defected in the hand . When the photos are congelated , they 've been congelated , and they 've been working with a bunch .
He has spring on the end of this caccept of this caccept and when I became solid , he killed a dog .
He wap the dog and created a brid , with the cash , and he created a sliterally , a sletheted a sland-up , and it 's disappeared on the banker , collished in the remain .
We want to talk about cavarsely with nothing ? [ Resian ] . And this , in different ways , [ Apaush ] is the symbologist population and all the indeed population of the world .
In the open 1999 , the canaded government , he reached the total control of a territory of a larger area of the larger California and Texas .
It 's their new patria . It 's called Nunavut .
It 's a dependent . It 's a territory . They 're all the minerary resources .
One splendig example of a nation-state can remember with his popular .
And , finally , I think it 's quite obvious at least at least who of us was in these remote zone of the planet , remote that it 's not remote .
For someone is home .
They represent human imagination that are humans at the high of the time . And for us all , the dreams of these children , as the dreams of these children , become part of the hope .
For finish , we have in National Geographic , we 're convince the politicians will never get to .
We believe that polemiics --
[ Applausi ] no persuasive , but we believe that stories can change the world , and maybe we 're the best institution to tell stories of the world . Each our mosite has 35 million liours .
156 countries transmit our television .
Our revision is literally millions of people .
Our work is travel in the etnosphery to bring our audience in a place of wonderful cultural , from which they 're going to go out and , hope , bring , bring will be able to revehicle reve-in the world : the deserve world existing existing in the world 's pluralistic . And we have to find a life in a world .
where the wisdom of all the popular can contribute to our wisdom .
Thank you .
I 'm going to talk about some things I 've written in this book that I hope I 'm going to reverse some of the connections , in case , in the case not nothing .
I 'd like to start with what I call " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " "
The official dogma is cool .
The dogen official dogen of all society Western society . The dogma is the further : If we want to massive to be a citizens . " The way to do it is massive liberty . "
The reason is , from a moment , in fact that freedom is in the same value , is precious , useful , useful , essential for humans .
On the other is that if we 're libes , each of us can act for all that massive , to do everything that massive , our well-being , without any decided in name .
The way to massive freedom is massize the choice .
More choice , more choices , more than people have , and more liberty is their freedom , is their well-being .
This , I think , is so deeply radical in the society that nobody dred would have to put it in doubt .
And it 's also deeply radical in our lives .
I 'm going to show you a few examples of what progress has made possible .
This is my supermarket . It 's not particularly great .
I 'm a simple note about conditions .
In my supermarket , there are 175 conditions , without contate 10 varieties of oil and 12 oil and 12 hundred balsamic and 12 balsamic conditions that nobody of the 175 hours of the 175 of proned in the circumstance .
Here 's what the supermarket is supermarket .
Then you go to the store of electronics to buy a stereo stereo : CD , radio , radio , plag , piag , piag , plag .
And in this single negoties , there 's a great number of components , there 's a great number of components .
We can realize six and a half million different different combinations using the components that there are only one negoties .
You have to admit that there is a lot of choice .
As the world of the communications .
Once I was a child , they could get all the phone services of the desire , and they were shapes by moving that were moving from mom Bell .
He was the phone , he didn 't buy it .
A consequence of that , between the phone was that the phone was never breaking .
These template , they went .
We now have a variety of telephones , especially in the phone .
Here 's the cellular cell .
My favorite is in the middle , MP3 , tackle , and the burn for the crackle .
If you don 't see it in the store in the gotior , you 're going to take .
And what happens is that people entering in the store and the question . And you know what the answer is ? The answer is ? The answer is " No . "
It 's not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn 't do it too many things .
So , in other aspects of life that are much more important of the buy buy , it 's the same choice .
Axitary healthcare : it doesn 't happen in the United States you go to the doctor and doctor say what you have to do .
Instead , walked out of the doctor , and the doctor says , " Well , we can do . A , or B , " Hoh has these benefits and these " B has these benefits . What do you want to do ? "
You say , " Dr. " What should I do ? "
And the doctor says , " A has these benefits and these risks , and B has these benefits and these benefits . "
" What do you want to do ? "
And you can see , you know , " Dr. " What would it do ? "
And the doctor : " But I 'm not . "
The result is , we call it " self-meless , " that looks like a beautiful thing .
But it 's actually not that a move the fish and responsibility to take someone who knows the doctor , someone else 's doctor , someone else that doesn 't know -- and it 's not in the ideal condition to take a lot of them , and so it doesn 't have a ideal patient .
There 's a huge marketing of drug products , direct people like me and you , who think if you think there 's no sense , because we can 't buy them .
But if we can 't buy them , why do they do it ?
The answer is that they want to doctor to ask them to ask them to change it .
Something like that is fundamental as our identity is a choice of choice , as you see in this vision , as you see in this vision . " We don 't want to provide their sex . We don 't want to be a huge identity : We have to invent it .
And we can reinventing how many times you aggraps .
That means that every morning , at the morning , you have to decide that kind of person wants to be .
I 'm going to be pushing in the family , a time , a common a common , under the time , it was that it was that it was that it was the most possible , and he started to make the most possible .
The only real choice was with who , not when you have , and not not when you 're doing after .
As it 's really to play .
I 'm going to really intelligent students , and I have a lot of work with a time .
And it 's not because it 's less brilligent .
but why I 'm impensierites , I have to ask , " I should have this ? I 'm going to spoke to it or not ? "
" Would I I have to be able to be able to think about before you 're going to the or at the career ? "
I 'm interrogative .
And they 're looking for answer these questions , even though this implation not completed the tasks that you can 't completed my own own own own own own examples .
And they really have to do that . They are important questions .
Now , the work : we 're lucky , like Carl was , because the technology allows us to work every day , every day , from every single day , from every single planet , from the Hotel Randol-.
And in the parently , there 's a corner , and I 'm not going to tell anybody where , WiFi works .
I don 't tell you , because I want to use it .
What does this incredible freedom of choice that we have about work ? That 's that we have to keep , continually decide , if we have to work or not .
We can go to see our son and see our son , and the mobile phone in a cell , the Blackberry in the other , and the noteteteeth , and the notetea .
And even though they 're all spactive , every minute that we see our son , we 're also asking , " I have to answer to this called ? "
" I have to say , " I have to say , " Do this letter ? I have this letter ? "
And even when the answer is no , that 's " , that makes the experience of your son , very different from what it would be in other conditions .
So , from any part of the things , and big things , big things and big , materials and the lifetime , life is a question of choices .
Once the world was this : There were some possibility , but it was not a choice .
The world of today is this : The dilemma is : Is it a positive thing , or negative ? "
The answer is Sholding .
The positive we all know , so we all know , so I 'm going to talk about the negative ones .
All this choice is two negative effects on people .
The first one , paradoxy is that produces instead of liberation .
With a lot of options in which choose , it becomes very difficult .
I offer a meaningful example : a study conducted on the plans of further .
A colleagues had access to the data of Vanxanxide , the giant society of funding , with about a million clients of employees .
What she discovered is that for every 10 solutions that are offered in more , the adesion of the floor of floor .
With 50 source of offers , there 's 10 percent of adesions , when they 're available . Why ?
Because with 50 sources that choose , is sick , it 's sically difficult decide , and choice is going to decide , and choice is remain .
And at questions , and still at questions , questions , and of course , questions , and of course , questions never get .
You know , it doesn 't only only mean that these workers are going to hand canoes , because they 're not going to have enough money , it also means that decision is that they lose the fund of componies that they 're also going to be able to be in the deep of the work .
Not to participating , they 're losing to five dollars in the work , which would be a lot of work , which would be bad to be .
So , paralization is a consequence of having too many choices .
And I think it makes the world like that .
" And finally , " Would you like , " kup , " kup , " kens , "
You 'd like to take the decision , if it 's right ?
You don 't want to choose the wrong source , and you can 't want to choose .
So this is the first effect . The second one is that we can avoid paralize the paralize and do a choice , we 're at less sitted by the result of how we would choose .
And that 's that for different reasons .
One of these is that with many conditions that are choose , if you buy one and it 's not perfect , is to imagine that you could have been doing a different choice that you could do a different choice that would be better . And what 's going on is that the alternative imagine us industry , and reduce diminuxium is that the pattern , and reremember the purpose is that the pursuit goes on the remember that the makes of the decision ,
And when it was a very good decision .
More choice is easy , easier is easy to be dispile that it 's inseems to be insection of choice .
And there is what economists call constantly the economisting .
Dan Gilbert asked a lot of standing a lot of things that we 're going to do things with .
In the rest , when there are a lot of options , it 's easy to represent the carland of the scarticks of the scarticks , and be less unless unslide that 's choice .
Here 's an example . I school with all the ones who are not New York .
But that 's what you probably think .
There 's this couple to Hamptons .
A place of slurther .
It 's splendida . Ottim days . It 's all for them .
Not . But what he thinks is , " Well , malth , malth , it 's August . "
" All my neighbors to Manhattan is . "
" I could talk about front of home . "
And it turns out two weeks , from the idea that 's losing -- every day -- the chance of parking -- the chance of parking .
The constery opportunity diminuges the satisfied for what we have , even when choice was an old .
And more are the options we have to look at , more than the characteristics . They 'll go back as constantly constantly .
Here 's another example .
This is a vision tells us a lot of things .
It talks about living the moment , and maybe of living slowly .
But the most important point is that any you choose , you 're choose to do , you don 't do other .
The things that we don 't choose have a lot of attractive attractive that can make less attractive attractive what we do .
Third point : it 's growing growing up .
I tried to my skin bought a new jeans .
I 'm going to be jeans .
Once the jeans were just a kind of , buy them and besty from bestivestive , they were discovered , only after having them a life and washed a lot of times , they began to go well .
So , I went to buy a new when the old old ones were went , and I said , and I said , " I need a couple of jeans , this is my jeans , this is my cut . "
The committed tells me , " Look , " Heasy fit ? "
He wants with the buttons or with the bottons ? " Stonewashed , " or " ached ? "
" Do you want to be able to be ? "
" Sotto them want to be a lot of ball . " Well , the ball of the ball -- " Continured .
I was sitting , and after a little bit , I was able to say , " I want the guy that was the only kind of like , " I want to be a only idea what , so for a hour , I tried to all the jeans , and then use out of the jeans , and the best couple of jeans that I had ever had .
It was the massive . I had got the best .
But I felt like it .
Why ? I wrote a book to understand it .
The reason I was worse that I was worse with all the same choice , the jeans had to be perfect .
And I was wait . I was wait . I didn 't expect anything excited when there was only a guy , but when I saw 100 different , hunting , at least a guy , at least a guess .
What I was buy , I was buy , but not perfect .
After I had compared that choice with what I was trying to do in compared .
The add of options in the life of people don 't do that , you know , these are the excellence of the same .
And that 's going to produce less unsatisfied , even when the results are good .
None in the world of marketing if it connected .
Because if they knew , you wouldn 't know what I 'm talking about .
The truth looks more to that .
" He was better when he was worse . " The reason he was better when he was better when he was better when he was worse was that when he was worse was still possible .
The world that we live in the world that we live -- opulents , industrialized , and industrialized citizens with the perfeature -- we 're hoping is that things are at the altitude of the expectative .
You never have surprised because your wait , you 're going to be able to your expectations , you have a giant .
The secret of happiness -- what you 're here -- is , " Basse wait , " Yes , you want . "
I mean , small autobiographic moment -- which I 'm really sposed and my wife is really stupend .
I couldn 't have to do better , I didn 't have accounted .
But it 's not always a good thing .
And finally , a consequence of jeans when you 're only that jeans are that when you 're not sitting , and you ask you , and I ask you , " Why ? "
" Who is responsible ? " And that 's the answer is clear .
The world is the responsible . What can I do ?
When there 's hundreds of jeans , and you buy a pattern , and you 'll ask people , and you ask who is responsible , it 's as a clear that responsible , you 're .
You might have been doing better .
With hundreds of available , there 's no hundred variety .
So when people take decisions , even though the result is walked , and they 're going to be able , and give the holding them .
In the last years , the depression is exploded in the industrialized world .
I think a significant factor -- not the only , but important -- that 's not the only one , but that 's important -- that honey , the people have experiences of the depression of the people because the standard is too high .
And when they have to explain this situation think that colcollege is .
So the final result is that we 're better , we 're better , but we feel worse .
Let me remember .
This is the official dogma , what we all all take for good and it 's completely fake . It 's not true .
There 's no doubt that a little bit of choice is better than haven 't at it , but it 's not going to have a little choice is better than a little choice .
There 's a critical value , magic . I don 't know what it is .
But I 'm sure we 've done by a piece of the level where the flip choices are improving our life .
Now , from the political point -- I almost finished -- from the political point , the nocity of the political nocity .
What it allows you all this choice in industrial society is the material .
There are a lot of places in the world , and you know , you know , where the problem is not that they have too many choice .
The problem is that they have too poor too .
So the face I 'm talking about is a disease of modern , remember the modern of the modern , remember society .
And what it does to be a lot of arrand that 's this : Steve Levitt talked about how much those constantly and discoverage seats for bounds are inuuseful . It 's a spring of money .
I mean that these choices , complicated and dispendious , it 's not that they 're just inuseful .
I 'm going to say , " I 'm going to be a lot of them .
They do it stand worse .
If a little bit of what in our society allows that was reversed in those where people have too much , you would not only be their life , it would not only be their life , but also .
This is what economists call a pareting improving .
A redistribution of redistribution is good at all -- not only to be the poor -- because of this choice in excess that it comes .
And then , to conclude , you can be in the way , you can be --
You know , people of culture , you think , " What does that fish ? "
" It 's obvious that you can 't be in a glass . "
" A castrated imagination , a limited vision of the world --
and that 's what I 've been interpreted like , at the beginning .
But then , thinking about it , instead , I realized that fish the knowledge .
Because the reality of fact is that if you eat the bocket , so that , " all you can 't get the freedom . " You don 't get the freedom .
If you pump the bocket so that it can decrease you can decrease .
You 're going to go and pursuit , and you 'll reduce it .
Everybody needs a sphere .
This is almost certainly too much , maybe even for fish , and it 's not a fish , and of course for us .
But the assed without some symbolic symbolic symbolic sphere is a recipe for the flap .
Thank you very much .
