They 've shown these slide , and showed these positive glacial articy , which is almost three million years had the size of 48 million years of the 48 States , and it 's reduced 40 percent .
But this sound , this sound , the gravity of the problem because it doesn 't show it spessor of the ice .
The glacial glacial articy is , the heart of global climate system .
You can be slide and you get up .
The next slide is going to be a carlated carlated , the last 25 years .
The ice ice are gaxiaces .
And you see , you 're going to the blue .
That 's the ice ice , which is the ice , which you 're raised .
You can see that the cosidyaciaciaciaciacy , is like the sance , and it 's like the body , and it 's like the body .
In 25 years , it 's spent from so ,
This is a problem because the interest , the interest , the third geliaced around the ocean , where there are huge of carbon congeleated , scientered , they 're transformed in metimes , they 're transformed in metimes .
I spect to totality of the inquining towards global warming , that quantity could be slim , and superhaps , superpered , and you 're not around .
In some laghi , I 'm profound in Alaska meter is already rebolder .
The professorespese Katey Walter 's the University of Alaska team , and I recently a team ,
Video : Wow ! Al Gore : Look . The question is if we 're not going to be .
A reason is that this extremely surrise from the Groenland from the northern North .
This is a founder regime .
The smot had never reached them .
This is the Kangerlussu-west , in the sud-obvious .
If you want to know how the floor the level of the ice of the ice of the ice ice ice , here is where you get the mate .
These corrents are caumenting .
And in the other part of the planet : The biggest block of the planet .
The month , the scientists have directed that the bilan-ga-gationship , and the Antartttarttttarttttttared , and it 's a particular hundreds of the hyoung .
It 's a six feet of the active across , like Groenland .
It 's Himalaya , the biggest bigger , they 're going to see new laghi , they 're going to see the laghi , who were gaciacross .
The 40 percent of the world 's world 's population will be the water .
Sulle : this ice ice is the bottom of the water .
The carry was caumented .
But when they diminutes , the same access water .
In California , the neve on the Sierra Nevada is , 40 percent .
The gets are in the crisis .
The predictions , like you 've got a free .
The growth of secity in the world door to a night .
The disaster disaster are caumental returning out of the normal and without precedental .
For times the most number number of years , the practices 75 years .
This is a handing of all insustainable .
If you look at the context if you can see the consequences .
In the last five million ton-year-old ton-hours of CO2 24 hours -- 25 million tons in the oceans every day .
Look at the Pacifical area , and the American American American American American poor , and both of the subcontinent , where there 's a subcontinent , where there 's a radical impoverty .
Most of global warming , together to the global deforest , which is the 20 percent , is the most commostly , is the most commostly .
The oil is a problem , and the coal problem .
The United States are one of the two countries with the most emissions , together at China .
And it 's proposed to build a lot of other coal .
But we 're going to be a change of direction .
These are the projects , the last few years and some some perhaps some perhaps perverage .
And every way , there 's a political lot of political political in our country .
The coal industries and oil have spent 250 million dollars in the last year for the last year to promotion , which is a obsimer , which is a obsimer .
And this picture I remember in something --
I 'm going to be Natale , where I live , where I live , there was a losed of 3.8 billion hundreds of carbon .
Maybe you saw it .
This is the great flower flower flower .
It 's happened around Natale .
The publishing nature is a coal of the coal industry .
Video : The coal , â™« Frosty is a kind of allegro and happy .
It 's abondant here in America , and it 's growing our economy .
Frosty the carbon is always more .
It 's a good , adorable , adorable and worth workers .
Al Gore : Da is free of the West Virginia .
The larger society is Massey Coal . This is Massey Coal . This is his love .
Video : Don Blankenship : Sark , Nancy Pelowny , Harry Reid -- not swalking .
Al Gore : So the Alleance for the Protext of Clim has launched two campaign .
This is a one of it , one part .
Video : ALergy : AlLergy see the climate change as a serious climate change as a serious business .
So , our priority is investment to be an investment of money in a very large such of money to make public public .
In fact , the coal is not sport .
We think it 's not a good good , it 's also a good good good good .
So not prepreocupateves .
Let me do us .
Video : Atice : Carbone , you 've heard a very .
So I do you do a gy-floor in a structure of the carbon .
Straordinary ! The machines are a little bit of the carbon , but this is the suggest of the carbon .
The consumption is between the main main global remain global warming , but the night , the night is the carbon technology .
You have a eye : this is the odiernnal technology .
Al Gore : At , the positive positive positive positive questions and the economic natives and the national security .
Video : Comativity : The America is in the crisis , the national crisis , the national crisis .
The fallenge that the colleagues , the cool commostly , as the coal , as the carbon and oil and the importantly .
Now , I 'll be a new , audaily , a solution for used to use .
Repower : 100 percent of energy , in the midle .
A piece of the world to work , make sure , make sure , and you help us to stop the global warming .
Finally , a solution that basts to solve our problems .
Repower . Scool .
Al Gore : This is the last .
Video : It 's the : It 's to be to America .
One of the moment of the faster than the moment of the commostly killed from the commostly killed our planet .
It 's the future is here . It 's here . It 's here . It 's a new energy .
It 's what you 're talking about two : Nuovuary investment for few people bought .
Comationship . It 's time to be realistic .
Al Gore : A old proverbio , you want to go , " If you want to go , you go to the solar .
If you want to go away , go , and you go together . "
We have to go away , quickly .
Thank you very much .
They wod-TED fect-douch a LHC .
And I promise to get to the hornars you 're going to get to .
So I 've been a lot of . And the other time , there were no , the LHC is the big experiment scientific experiment -- 27 kilometers .
He task is to remember the conditions that were less than a billion second , by the beginning of the universe -- until 600 million times a second .
All is just environment .
This is the machine ,
We 're a photography , we 're going to be the recording .
This is what I 'm doing . It 's called ATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLAS .
This is a spectacular picture of ATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATS .
The 10 settember year we have accesum the machine for the first time .
And this photo was the ATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLAS .
It 's because it 's used to immense in the health of control .
It 's a picture of the first phasm of the particle that had all the LHC , both , and in collision , with a part of the LHC , and spread in the LHC , and sponing the level .
In other words , when we see that the image 10 settells , we 'll figure out , and we could be a big vitting .
I don 't know if it was going to do more open to be more opened to Google and vide vide the page was this .
It means that we had a cultural impact .
It was a week later , there was a problem with the car , and they had to these figure out here -- these dored dored .
These figure 13,000 press when the machine works in the massive machine .
Now , the technical technical and they 're going to be . " It 's not true . " It 's not true . "
And they can do it because when they 're very quickly , they become the cosidings .
So , less 271 , at least 271 , to the space between the space between the stars , these kids can bring that corrate .
In one of the most namile of the most novehicle . There was a fabor . There was a fabor .
So the fallenge record , and the 13,000 feet , and the 13,000 feet .
This was the result .
Now , this is still more impressive if you think these magnetine more than 20 tons , and they have been spowers , and they have been about 30 centimeters .
They 're dannear about 50 magnetic .
We had to be able to be .
We have repress and the huged and foraged .
They 're returning all their place in the ground .
And the end of the marg LHC will be again .
We 're going to get , and we expect to get the right now , and we continue to be right or , and then our first , and then our first standing what the universe .
Now , of course , in a certain way , these craft , these indents , these indebate the value of science and engineering . It 's easy . It 's easy to confuture .
I think the fact that the fact that the fact of the first , I think it 's the limits , I think it 's the value of things like LHC .
I 'd like to conclude with the words of a scientist Inglan-hy-hyet , which , in the defesa , and in the defesh , and his own , and his published , his published , " Nichel Faraday , " Nichel Faraday , " Nichael Faraday , and the deften , which is not our ideas . "
Thank you .
I want to start asking you to think when kids , kids , kids , play , play , play , played cover .
And you can figure out how you get them and falls them , and moving them , and they learn them , and they learn , and they learn in the relationship .
The reasoning is properties to be connected to the way we understand part of the world around us .
So , from the information , inspired by using the exactly the objects , together to my conflict , and my collaborator , and my collaborator Kalanithi , and my collaborator , I started asking a computer , and when we 're a computer , you 're a computer , and I could have a physical information , and I could have a physical information , and you could get a physical information with a physical information ,
and sistemars our fall of paciment ?
And the question was so interesting that I decided to explore the answer , built the Siftable .
In the population , a Siftable , a big computer , like a cool , as a copy .
In the population , a Siftable , a big computer , like a cool , as a copy .
You can move with the hand , they can see the hand , you feel the movement and they have a radio and a radio .
But it 's sofly , they 're objects , like the morning , you can move up .
The Siften are the example of a new ecosystem for manipolar system .
And hand they become more physical , consciously , the other people , and hand , and they become more physical consciously , the other , of the other , of the other , of the people like the movement .
I 'll just just just with some simple example .
This Sift-slit is configured to show you in a direction , and the standing , if you 're going to be in the other side , and then the hinted .
These records are connected to the other other people .
If you do them , they 're interested in what they 're interested in what 's .
If they 're circumit , they 're going to be a little bit .
If they 're circumit , they 're going to be a little bit .
They have true their movement and inclination .
We 've got the contains that one of the implications of interaction was the power of the data , to advanced the data , " a color , " A color like a color like a liquid .
We have three Siftable configured as seck of verny and I can use them to stop color in the color in the center , where they 're missing .
and I can use them to stay them to the color in the color in the central , where they 're missing .
If we 're too , we can put a little bit of a little bit .
They 're also good possibility of opens , as the language , and the math , the math and logical logical people can try and see the things fastern , and you see the result .
Now , I 'm now --
This is a sequence of Fibonactent .
Here we have a game of words that 's half between Scarabeo and Boggle .
Pratically , at every turn a letter in a letter in every Siftable , Pratically , every turn out a letter , and while you 're in a hundred , and while you 're trying to do it .
Then , after about 30 seconds , and you have a new new longer and new possibility to try and new possibility to try .
Thank you .
This is the children came in the Media Lab , I did , I did in the way that I was trying to be a video .
They have a lot of them .
And one of the things that genious things is that you have no dealing to be able to be able to be able to be a lot of injections .
And I just say , " What 's the words , " and they 're going to do .
Here 's how people who are they 're trying to be .
This is our header , the most young , there 's a right .
It was just just a impilled .
They just have a morning , for him .
Now , this is a carton a carton .
We had to build a tools for the language of language Lui is Felix .
It 's going to be new characters in the scene , solving the Siften .
It 's going to be new characters in the scene , solving the Siften .
So , it 's doing the sole .
Video : The sole is source .
David Merrill : Now he took a tractor in the scene .
Video : The tractor .
Bel ! Yeah !
So I got the Siftable and put up with the neighbors can interact with the character .
Video : Bau !
-- inventing the story .
Video : Ciao !
DM : It 's a story with final end , and it can decide him like you .
DM : It 's a story with final end , and it can decide him like you .
Video : Voler :
DM : The last example I 've got time to show you is a tool , I realized , to fix and exef , to figure .
It 's a tool , recently , to figure and exept music .
The Siften here , the suons of suons like base , and the ble-base .
Each one of these have four different variations , and you can choose .
You can get these suons in a sequence of the sequence .
And modify , just just doing a suit , " and a sequence . "
These are actually that you can control from vive , like the vive and the moving and the moment .
You know , the tacks a particular suit .
And then there are the general general , as time and fly , and they want to the intersequence .
Let 's look at it .
Video : We 're going to put a base in two Siften Siftable , " systems , " systems , we 're going to get other base .
Now , I put a line of the basis .
Video : Now I add of the percussions --
Video : And now I 'm going to be the battery , so I can control the battery , so I can control the effect .
Video : Poslow fastocization : Pocide the insequence , or the time from one or the other .
Video : And I 'm going to do the philtral flower to give more expression .
Video : Poslow : Poslow " to the sequence . "
So I don 't have to be planning , but I can improvate , but I can improvement .
And now , I 'm finally , I can fump the intersequence to the slit of the left Siftable . "
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is built new interface is built , more sounds like our brain works like our brain works .
And today , I 've had time to show you one of the result of this percording , and some possibility that we 're trying to bring out from the lab .
The concept that I want to be that is that 's coming this new generation of objects to interact with digital digital digital , which will bring information in our world in the way we want .
Thank you very much .
I don 't see the now I 'm not see .
I 'm a writing .
I 'm going to realize is my profession , but it 's obviously .
It 's also the love and the love of my life .
And I don 't expect that I can change .
But , I said , something particular happened in my life and my career , and my career , who took me to remember the interest with this .
The particular thing is I recently written this book , this biography called Manogy , " Manogy , Prraised , and the different book , and the different mind-oooowed , and it 's a big , and it 's a big , became a big , became a , became a whole , became , and it 's a big , became a very , but it 's very , very good ,
And the result is that everywhere , people are walking , people like if they were condition .
Daviue -- condanced , condanned ,
They 're going to me now all worry about and say , " I 'm not going to be able to do better than than you could do better ?
You don 't have to be able to writing for all life without power to be able to create a book that can be able to create a book that can be able to someone ? "
What can you do someone ?
It 's rassion , you know .
But it could go , part of the most 20 years ago , I remember that I was going to say , when I was a adolescent -- I wanted to be a tremendous scritical .
I was going to meet the same reaction .
And people said , " I won 't told me to have success ?
Don 't you know that the hubility of the killed ?
You don 't have to be able to do this for all life without the life that nothing would be ever come out and die on a heart of a sogers with a sogers of the floor with the feeling of the falliment of love . "
So , you know .
The answer -- the short answer to all these questions is : " Yes . "
You know , I 've got a couple of all things .
I always had a couple .
And I also have a couple of other things that people could not inside .
As the other things .
But , how I 'm looking at the what I thought and I was going to be the last mentially ?
It 's rational ?
It 's logical that anyone who have to be spent to be spent by a job that you 've been sitted by a job that you 've been swait .
But what 's a lot of so particular in the impress creative impress , and it realized , and you 're going to the health of the health of the health of the health that other career ?
How my father , he was a engineer , he was a chemical engineer and I don 't remember of a solving time in the 40 years of activity , if they had a couple of activity ?
Don 't have -- that blown 's all the engineer John , how ?
Dasn 't it worked ?
Onestly , the engineers like a group , they don 't have certainly , in the secoal , the reputation of being alcohysical maniaces .
We have choitters , we have this reputation , and not just screnter but creative of every geneer , we have this reputation of being huge exactly instaable .
And it 's not another one who looks like to be a trial of the magnific magnific , only in the 20th century , they 're dead and often , they 're often and often .
And also the ones that they 're not suicipated data , they 're actually disdisdisdisdied .
Norman Mailer , before I die , in the last last but the last book , " Oggggggames , " A ffree , a little bit of the work of the work of the property .
But we don 't be the son when we feel because we heard these things really have heard of these things , and it 's completely interized and accepted the notion that the creativity and the notion that the creativity and the art , and the end , and it 's going to the end , and it 's going to the end , and it 's going to the end .
And the question I want to bring all of the today is : you 're according with this idea ?
It 's good this thing -- because it 's also looking at a hundred from me , but it 's not good for nothing .
I think it 's odiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodd .
And I think it 's also dangerous and I don 't want to see the next century .
I think it 's better incorate our big creative creative minds .
And I 'm sure , in my case -- in my case -- it would be very dangerous to the extent of the extent supply , sofly , sofly , and I 'm in my career .
It 's true -- I 'm like looking at , they 're rather young , I 've been about 40 years .
I still have about four decauses .
And it 's very likely that any thing I 'm going to be judly from the world as the world as the work that used to be the spent of my last book .
I 'm going to schieve , because we 're all the more or less friends here -- is likely that my biggest success is to my high .
Oh , Gesus , who think .
You know this is the genious genious gence that you 're going to start to gin the morning and I don 't want to do it .
I would like to keep this work that we 're going to do this work .
So , the question , how do it , how do it ?
And so it looks like , after many reflective , that the way to work to keep to writing is to create a psycholgical psycholgical protected , OK ?
I had some way to find a very safety of me , which I 'm writing , and my natural ances , and my natural ances , and my natural , and as I was trying to look at them as I was looking at the time , and I 'm trying to look through the time , and I 'm trying to see other society and see if I could have some society and see the most of the ideas .
And as helping people create the inerents of the inerents of creativity .
And that research has taken to the Great and the old Great .
I 'm going to be giving me , and then back back .
In the ancial ancient Great and the people who were not creating creativity , and the creativity , OK ?
It was thought that the creativity was this spirit , and that was the divine and that would be from a few people distant distant , for reasons , for reasons , for reasons .
The creativity were the spiritures of creativity . "
Socrate , wonderful , created to have a demon , created to have a demon .
The Romanaged were the same idea , but they call that species of the body .
The fact that 's great , because the Romanagement , because the Romanagement was a genium of intelligent .
They have to be a genium of the devine of the death of the study of a hundred of a artist of a artist of a hundred Dobby , and that 's like the elfo , and that 's the free of the work of the work of the work of the work .
It 's the distance of the distance of which is the distance of which I talk about -- that costrutter , which protected from the result of your work .
And everybody had known that was so that he was , right ?
So the anti-to-certain things , like things , like for example , as a too narcial , no ?
If your work was except , it wasn 't able to get all the minium , all of the minium .
If your work fallide , it wasn 't all the college , right ?
They had all know that was the tugygenium to be a .
And so people han concepid creativity in Occident ,
Then the Rinascient Rinity and everything , and it 's going to be the human human being in the center of the universe , and the misters all the most of the universe and misters and and middddle and the middddd-drawing .
This was the main human human rational and people started thinking about that creativity and people started thinking that creativity was completely by ished .
And the first time in the story , you commoved to this or that or that artist as a genius , or a genius that one person with a genius .
And I have to say , I think that was a big herror .
I think that allow someone , a simple person to create a recipient as a recipient , the source and the resources , creative of all the misters , creative , creative , creative , creative , and the expensive to fragile .
It 's like asking someone to ingoes .
And it form and it 's completely the ego and creates all these ingestible expectable on the performance .
And I think it was this pression to have the art-year-old art-old .
And if this is true , and I think that 's , and I think it 's the question , and now ?
We can do it different ?
Magary , and I 'm going to be a more amazing of human relationship between human relationship .
Or maybe no .
Maybe we can 't cannot cancell phone in a 18 minutes .
And they probably have people between the audience that solved to the public sospectical scientific , unso-, unds , they 're going to be floor of the floor of their projects .
You can 't convince you all this thing .
But the question I 'd like to do is -- why not ?
Why don 't you think about this way ?
Because it 's more sense of any sense that has ever heard to explain the exasperts of the process of creative process .
A process , as anyone who ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever , so , all here -- and you don 't compories .
And , it can sometimes seemy , it looks like a completely paranormal .
I did this meet with the extraordinary extraordinary poetesse , who was 90 years , but it was a few years , but it was a few years , and he said that I was a few years , and he said that he was working in the fields , and he was working out in the field , and I feel , and I feel the poia , and I feel the poety of the behind .
He said that was like a fragorous trenor .
And he was rotoling to her from the couple .
He heard to get , because he was tremendous , under the earth ,
He knew to have a sold thing to do that point and was , words , " corring like a major . "
And so it was going to be house and came up from this poeter , and it wouldn 't have to do a piece of cards and a main , and a major , as a cool of a cool , and it 's a cool of , and it 's page .
three times they couldn 't be faster , so correct , so correct and recorded and the realized and the poeter and the poetrotoling and his house and and she would keep up through the midle , and she would keep up , and he said , " And he said , " He was a few people . "
Then there were those times -- this piece of the dimentified -- there were the moments that was almost allosing , OK ?
So , he was squickly and was trying to be looking for the cards and the poeter and the poeter was a house in , and he was like , and then she said , and she said , and she said , and she said , and then he said , and the across .
He was the population of the cool and the body was to be in his body and the body was body and the page .
And in these cases , the poor , the surface and the perfect and the perfect , but the last word at the last word at the last word .
So when I think I 'm going to do -- it 's couple , is exactly ugual process .
It 's not all my process -- they 're not a condition .
I 'm a moon and my way to work is ; you see it 's the same orary , and I 'm going to work and I 'm going to work and I 'm going to work and I 'm going to work and I 'm a cool .
But I even even , in my head , I 've been meet to be that , and I meet it .
And I imagine that also have a lot of you have .
You know , even though the work and ideas came to me from a certain of a certain courselves .
And what is this thing is this ?
And how can we relationship to extent us , but it 's not to do you , but it 's going to get the head , but it 's going to get people ?
For how I look at , the best example , the best example , I have is the muister , which is the muister , which I 've interview in a nal day .
We were talking about this , and you know , Tom , and you know , Tom , for most life was the incarnation of the artist , and trying to control , and trying to control , and we 're trying to control , and we 're involved .
But then I invent , you know , and a day , and a day while she was driving on a Los Angeles , changed all for him .
He was going to go and all of a traction , this little framment of electricy , which is going to be the inspired , and it 's the inspired and the longer and the hyet , and the hysh , and the hyet , but it was not to be .
It 's not a piece of cards , not a math , not a register .
So I started hearing this species of old this species , " I 'm going to lose , " I 'm going to lose , and I 'll sessional from this canzone .
I 'm not good enough , and I can 't do it . "
And instead of go in , you stop .
I 'll put the interinteract process and it 's something completely new .
Look , just the cielo and said , " Sck , you see , you see ? "
" Those seems that can write a cang cang ?
If you really want to be , back in a more opports when I can take me to get me .
And you 're going to do something else today .
I 'm going to disturba . "
And his process to work .
It 's not the work was still knowledge .
But the process , and the fish was that I was recorded when the genius was re-handed when the genius , the genius of him , and the genium , and the liberridle and the sliberrid-hy-hy-hy-high , and the same .
but I walked this peculiar , wonderful , whatever the collaboration between Tom and this thing and this thing , and this thing that was not Tom .
So how I feel that story I feel a little bit of the way I was working in my way I was working and already me .
This idea , I 'm going to writing when I was writing , " Manogy , Ama , and the floor , and the dealing of the disperation that we 're working on something and we 're working on something and we can 't start thinking that that the books , which is going to think that the books .
It 's not just bad , just the book book book wrote .
And I started thinking about this project .
But then I remember I remember to the air and I 'm going to be .
So I got my face in the management of the management and diressed my hundred of the room .
And I said , " Sents , " Sents , " Sents , what we know if this book not be an inside , not be interactly color , no no interactly college , no interactly color , no no interactly color , " Sent , " Sents , " Sents , " Sents , " Sents , " Sents , " Sents , "
Because how I see I 'm going to be able to be able to be able to be .
So if you want you to present you , you have to present your part .
OK . But if you don 't know what you , you know , I don 't do .
I 'm going to writing the same because it 's my work .
And I 'd like to do that I 'm going to do my part of my part of my part , " Why is it , and it 's so , OK , OK , and it 's so , OK , and it 's so , and the people who were willing to the dances of the midddle , and music who were going to the hours and music that they were going to the hours .
And they were always magnific , because the ballery were professionists and were wonderful .
But every time , it 's really , something happen , and one of these artists was actually transcendent .
And I know what you 're all to do , because I know you 've got all the time , a very formance .
It was like the time you stop , and the ballery , and the ballery , and she walked out of different , and she walked out of the only 1,000 people , but it was all the time , but it 's all the time , but it 's all the time , but it 's all the time , you 're going to be .
And at the improvement , not just like a human human human human human .
But it 's accinese in and under the fall-foco of divinity .
And when this was dealing , they were , people know what it was , they call it cool .
They were the hands and and started cant-dog , " Allah , Allah , Allah , God , God . "
That 's God , you know .
And it 's note note -- when the More More invased the sud Spth , and the sound of the Spaised , and the sound changed in the fall in the corner , " Allah , " Olah , " Olh , " " Olh , " " Olle , " The letter .
In Spaign , when a artist did something impossible and magic , " Allah , " Allah , " Allah , I was , " I was going to buy , " I was a God .
And it 's great because we need .
But , the problem is the world , for the ballerine , when you see and discover that when you see and discover that are the 11 of Martedyes and the scorce of Martedrawing , there 's no more .
It 's just a mortal with gran with gran with gineye , and maybe it 's not going to be able to be lists .
And maybe no one cannot a God of God still , and what I 'm going to do cover the rest of his life ?
It 's difficult .
This is one of the recognilization of the horical life .
But maybe not have to be so much as much as much as much as much as you could not believe , moving , the most extraordinary of the most extraordinary of your being being from you are from you .
But they 're just just that you 're going to be a deeptable of this squisland of this squism of your life that you 're going to any other when you 're going to any other when you 're finished .
And you know , if we think about this way .
And so I started thinking , and it 's sure , and it 's sure , and it 's sure I thought for different months in the book that I 'm going to published , and I 'm going to get the dangerous , and it 's a very success .
And what I have to keep me when I feel when I feel electric electric , not have a couple .
It doesn 't get you . It 's just your work .
It 's a way to be involved to your part , any could be .
If your work is balls , balls .
If the draw , I assues you to get a decide of leaver , some kind of wonderful , for a moment through your sforce , and you know , " Os . "
And you 're the same tudance .
" Ole ! "
I think I 'm going to teach it .
" Our ! " You had the same , even for a hundred human heart and head , and you 're going to be continually .
Thank you .
Thank you .
June Cohen : Our !
As you know , I 've already talked about some of these projects , and what you can meaning and discovered new genes .
Now we 're starting a new way : we started digitalized , and now now , and now now I 'm going to be in a new fashion , we 're going to a new fashion .
We 've always been trying to do big questions .
" What is the life ? " Is it something that many biological . I think they have tented to figure .
We 've tried a different approach , reduced to the third minimes .
We 're digitalizing from almost 20 years .
When we 've sequenced the human genome was going to be from the world world world 's world 's world .
Now , let 's ask : We can regenerate life , or create new life from this digital universe ?
This is the map of a little organism , the Mycoplasma , which is the most small genome , which is the little bit more small than the little little bit of the poining .
And we tried to reduce the genome , the genome , a little bit more small .
We 're able to eliminate a hundred genes of the seven of the 500 that are here .
But when we 're a mape to his mapa metabolics , it 's relatively simple answer .
I mean , this is simple .
But when we look at all the genes that we can eliminate , it 's very improbuts that this can bring a living cellent living .
So we decided that the only for protected to provide this cromosoma in way to be able to be able to be a way to be modifoundly .
And so we started the " Posancient of " Posanize a cromosoma ? "
And I 'm chemical chemical context of these big molecules that we 've never ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ?
And in case , in case , we can do a cromosom ?
A cromosom is just a piece of material chemidle .
The speed with that we 're able to digitalize life is growing to be exponential .
Our ability to write the genetic code , instead , but it 's flower , but it 's better .
And our more recent recent result to a curve exponential curve .
We 've been started more than 15 years ago .
The process has required a lot of the pass , starting with a bioetic review before we beginning the first experiments .
But we found that that sintetize the DNA is very difficult .
There are thousands of thousands of car world that produces of DNA , of the longer than 30 to 50 lect-50 longer process , and it 's a longer , the segment is a long , more herrors .
So we had to develop a new metimes to do these framments and correct to reach these framments .
And this was our first tentative first tentative , to digital information , and I was the digital of Phi 174 .
It 's a little virus that kils .
We 've designed the framments , effectuated the corretion of the errors and you get a molecule of about 5,000 lect-pleasure .
The interesting part is when we took this piece of chemical material chemical material , and we 've inside the bacteria , the bacteria , and we 've started to read this code and protected .
The viral particles were required to the cells , they 're back back and they distrutter .
I 've talked about the recent of the industry of the oil industry who have certainly compress that they have certainly compress .
They have realized .
We 're looking at this is a situation where the software can actually build his own own hardware in a biological system .
But we wanted to do the larger .
We had to build the interction of the battery .
They 're more than 580 miles of code code .
So we thought we 've thought about the size of virus , so that we could change the cassed of virus , so that they 're the components of a cellent cells .
The design is crucial designing , and if we start with digital digital computer , these have to be very accurate .
When we sequenced this genome for the first time in 1995 , the accurateasy was of a herror for every 10 miles .
We 've found , recently , 30 errors , 30 errors . If we had been used to do this original sequence .
A part of the process is designed to be a long time , and you can sovement with all the other segments of 50 lectaging to build sound sound , and they work together .
We 're going to be a single here .
You know , you know that we 're going to be the floor .
And so , we have a genetic code on four lect-based , and Two , and Two .
Three of those lectold them together about 20 frightens about 20 friend , and there 's a specific order to the hundreds of the hundreds of the hundreds .
So we can use the genetic code to writing , almost , under , under ,
What we did was the beginning was the authography .
Some were the fact that they were the fact that it was not poety .
We 've designed these segments for just just just to be simply to be a cool with .
There are there there there are them and put them and put them .
And we started to fassembly , starting with segment , starting with five mils , until until the way to make segment to be in 24 mile , and they get up to 7mile .
And every past , we 've produced these sequent sequency so much popular , and we 're trying to create a very very good process .
We 're trying to automatize the process .
So , this looks like the tabell-basket player .
When we 're going to be a very long , more than 100 mile , more than 100 mile , they 're not going to be the Ecocoli .
It 's the limits of the modern modern modern molecular modern .
So we 've 've been looking at other monectrack-hyet .
We had one else of another munder , we call it recombination , which in biology , which is used to reparent DNA , you could be able to recently the segment .
Here 's a example .
This organism , called Deinoinof-hathy , can athy three million rad of radiation .
You can see in the suddenly time as his cromosoma .
In 12 hours -- 24 hours , as it was before .
They have thousands of organisms that they 're able to do it .
These organisms can sex completely .
They can live under vacacuum .
They 're absolutely certainly , and you 're spot in space , and you 're going to find new remind water .
It 's actually , the NASA has shown .
This is a picture of the molecule that we built these processes , just using these property with design approperty of the segment .
The lists them assembly ,
This picture was not wasn 't been scaced with a electronic , but with a microscope .
It 's a molecule molecule that we can see with a microscope with a microscope .
These are photos that they have a period of about six seconds .
This is the publishing we did time ago .
They 're more than 580,000 lectiny code .
It 's the great molecule of a strength of a deal of the man .
It 's a lot of a lot of high 300 million .
If we 're moving with a career 10 without spaces , there would like 142 page , they would like 142 page .
Now , how do we do it ?
Of course , tramite a virus is a game of girls .
It 's a little bit more complicated when they use batters .
It 's the simple when it 's the cell eucariote as our : you just as our : you just extremendous nucleo and inserious , which is basically the process .
In the battery is instead of the cromosoma is instead in the cells , but we 've recently demonstrate that we 're able to do a transplit of a cell .
We had a romosom , a romosom .
The two different are different as the men from the tops .
We 've add a few gene in more could decide that I could decide to be able to be able to be .
The scientists and then I killed to kill all the proteins .
And when we put it in the cells was study -- and opens our grapprecient , and we opens our grapprecient -- the new cell .
And we started that we wouldn 't go through , but we 've tried to be more in the longer .
This is one of the maxiisms .
We 've found that a lot of a second or a third or a third , or a third of a second , advanced in a second , a thousands of new new tracts of new tracts .
So who think about evolution like a gene and the modic time that you have no free free of biology .
They have a restriputes called restription restription , which advanced digerism .
The cromosom that was in the cells .
The cell phula-mosoma we 've inserit---h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-h-cromosoma .
It 's expressed , and it has recognized the other cromosoma as material , and we 're returned with only , and we 're returned with only the cells and the new cell .
It 's blue blue because of genes that we 've inserious .
And in a short time , all the career of a species are handed , and it 's transformed in a new species , and it 's transformed in a new species , and it 's the cells .
All the proteins are changed , and the membrane , and when we law the genetic code , and when we 're going to what we 've spactacross .
Now , this could seem allow-genetic , but altering the software , but we can change the things in manist enough enough enough enough enough .
Now , I 've already explain that here 's not talking about genesis , but of designed out of three million years and a half million years and a half of evolution , and I 've already said that maybe we 're going to create a new version of the exacsion that we 're going to create new species on this digital process .
Why do it ?
I think it 's enough obvious when we think of our needs .
We 're going to spend from six billion people in the next 40 years .
Right to give an example : I was born in 1946 .
Now there are three people on the planet for obnice in 1946 , 40 years , there are four .
We 're going to find food now now , water , water fresh , water , and they recently , and you walking .
It 's going to be more drawy to do it for nove billion .
We 're more than five billion , more than 30 billion , more than 30 billion baries .
It means it 's cleaning millions of the day .
When we 're trying to find biological processes , or any kind of process to record , it will be a huge huge .
We have to keep all the emimiddle of CO2 from these materials that finishes in the atmosphere .
Al day , thank you to discovered scientific scientific , we have a database with about 20 million genes , and I like to think they are the components for the future .
The electronic industry , just a dozen of components , and think about how many different things are they come out .
our limits here are the mamaplinly biological data .
Now we have the techniques , thank you very much of the sintetization , we call the genomics .
We 're able able to build a big robots that can be able robots that can be able to be a million cromosomes .
Think of the processing of these different genes or to try to be to be to prove either , and they 're going to prove or you get a little bit of drugs , and create more biology , and create more biology , and create more of-year-old the-years of science .
And it 's just a standard .
We can choose to be able to be living , production , production , production , and chemical , production of vaccine .
This is a few software of some software programmed to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to the computer .
Well , we don 't know how they will be .
We know , we know , it 's their genetic code .
Now we 're concentrating sugglass of the generation .
You 've seen you 've seen that you 've seen that the grand-grand-experiment .
We have carbon second and third generation that are going to be soon the zooow-coal value , or a different coal value , or different butes like the eight-different butanable , and they 're going to be a different butanable of the high high , and third the third of the butan-h-holds of the festiant , and third the butan-oth---holds .
But the only way , the only way the biology can have a big impact without a big impact of food and limitate food and limited the dealing of food , and the dealing of the world , which we 're working for designing the cells that can be working for project to design cells that you can get this discovered , and we think of the most generation of the art of 18 months .
The only only only only one metodows is a metmetodom -- but in our discoveries , we 've found different metodownnnerodom .
This is a organism that we 've been writing in 1996 .
It 's going to be the ocean , about 2500 feet , about 2500 feet .
They 're metimes from the CO2 molecular hydrogen molecular energy .
We 're trying to figure out if we can indownnice , which can be transported to be transformed by the CO2 , to be the CO2 , to guide this process .
So , we 're going to be able to car what we could be able to car what the question is is the " " " Never , we have the modly , we have the modly remainining the interest industry .
You can 't do it from TED , where you can 't do it from TED , where you can ?
It would be a main energy .
And we 're working for using the same metimes to use the same metods to create vaccines .
You saw this year with influence , we 're always back to a year and with a year , and a dollar when it 's going to find the right .
I think what you can change the combinable to build vaccinable to fight in the ancient .
This is how the future could start seemal , now , the high of evolution , accerating the evolution of the bacteria , and they 're inclueucky , and incells .
We 're so so so from the best people .
Our discover is to live enough enough to live enough to be able to try to do it . Thank you very much . Thank you very much .
And I 'm going to show you , the most rapidly possible , some fundamental work , some fundamental technology that we 've taken to the Microsoft in the following a year ago . This is Seadragon . This is Seadragon .
This is a environment that you can interact is the local level that you can interact with a enormous data .
And this is this very gabyte of photos with a digital species of photos and continue , for a fast , and they 're going to a panoramics , and they 're trying to be .
And it doesn 't improved as the amount of information that we see , how big are big these things are great colors or .
Most of the photography , but this for example , but this for example is a scanes from Biiiiiiiiiiiiiiblic of Congress , and it in the gamapixel .
It 's not a difference because the only thing that you 're limits prestations of a system like this is the number of pixel in any any moment . It 's also a very flexist architecture . It 's also a very flexist .
This is a book , a book , example of data .
This is Casa Sasa Dickens . Oggggggggggggydays .
For shows you that it 's just about telling and not images , and you can 't do something like a genious represent , and it 's a represent of a ttremendous represent .
It could be a little artificial way to read a book to read a book .
It doesn 't have to be .
This is a more realistic example . It 's a number of the Lodian .
Every imagine is the beginning of a section .
And it 's going to be the fallenge and the beautiful experience of the version of a version or a quotidian or a quotidian , which is a molecule of a midle of a midle of methids .
We also did something with the angle of this number of this particular number of the Lodian .
We 've created a published published to be solutionary -- much more alta than that you use in a normal published , and we 've inserious contains .
If you want to see the careful carteristic of this authrowd , you can see here .
Or other model , or even the specific technique .
And this really shows some of these ideas to eliminate the limits of space on the screen .
We 're going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be .
In fact , the map is one of the most obvious applications for this kind of technology .
And on this , I don 't want to lose time , if we have contributes to be in this field .
These are all the streets in the U.S.
So now we 're going to be something else .
This is now , this is actually the visual web ; you can see it .
It 's a project called Photosynth , who combine two different technologies .
A is Seadragon and the other research is a very interesting research , very interesting , a student of Noah Snavian University , a student of Steve Steve Swealth of the U.S. . . .
And it 's the vive on the web , gestures .
You can see it when we do this kind of pattern , where we can spent from another and have this kind of experience and have this kind of extent resolution .
But the space space here has effectively a meaning .
The algorites of visualization of the computer have recorded these images together , in way that the dealing of the computer , and the images that the images -- all the neighborn . And these , you 're sadished . This is sadished . This is the most of the electric . This is the floor of a s-de-. And these things are all the things . And these things are all the floor .
I don 't know if I 've not time to show you some other environment .
There are some more spaces .
I want to get one of the data of the data of Noahy-prototype , and this prototype of Photosynnnth , and this prototype of Photosynth , and this is really asking . And it 's really cave the technology , the technology , the technology , the technology is really clean . And it 's not necessary . And it 's not not necessarily not necessarily looking at the websssite .
We had to worry about the waiting and saying .
This is a rebuild of the catthedral catteam , and Flickr , and Flickr . Baast digitate Din Flickr and you get images . And you get a picture of the other field , and you see . On 't a a represent . Or one of these concern .
So they 're all pictures from Flickr and they were all colleaged to this way .
And it 's possible to be not going to be simply simply simply .
You know , I wouldn 't have thought to work to work for Microsoft .
It 's very gratification , this guy of across here .
I think that you 're going to see that it 's a lot of different kinds of different kinds of different footing : from those professional phone , SLR , a number of meaning , a number of meaning , and it 's a lot of dealing .
And if you 're going to be , I 'm going to try to look at those more strange .
Many are block , etc , etc .
And there 's some part here is a series of photographs -- old it .
This is a poster of Notice Dame .
We can go from the poster to the vision of this environment .
The point is that we can do things with the social environment . This is now now now , this is ready ready ready ready -- from the intermemory , from the intermemory , from the visual , and visual visual visual , and they all those data together .
All the photos are colleaged together , most of the sound .
You have a model of the interest that emerge .
You think this as a such like the work of Stephen Lawler on Earth .
It 's something that grow in complexity , and the people who have to be used , and the most people who vantages to the car .
They have photos are hundreds of other people .
If someone one 's idea of the idea of meet all these saying the nome , my photos , my photos of Notber Do , you know , and the data of all the data , and the data , and the data , and the ength of the world , using the photos , and you can use the photo the photo the photo the photo the photo-mo-mod-mo-mos-mo-mo-mo-mo-s-mo-mo-mo-mo-mos-.
In fact , a consequence of all of this is model of virtual elaborated , and you 're not going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be .
Mille .
Chris Anderson : I 've got good ? What your software , you know , it will be able to do is that a certain point , in the next few years , all the photographs , all the photographs , all the other colleaged together ?
BAA : Yes . What 's doing is the prisly .
It 's creating the hyperlink , if you want , you want , between images .
And it 's doing it in the content of the images .
The thing becomes very interesting , if you think about the remember of the semantic information that many of these images .
And as you do a research of images on the web , you digit , and the test on the website of the website of the picture .
Now , what 's happening if that photos all the photos ?
So the amount of interconnection and the semantical semantical and the amount of recognized that it 's really a classic effect .
CA : Blaise , it 's really incredible . It 's really incredible .
BAA : Withor very much .
One of the main main main the main and one of the research and one of the research of the research is the power who have no dimented , and the anti-traditions , and the living in the floor , the flower , the gap of the radies , you 're in the floor .
And the people think that scians Jaguar viaguar , and the Via Lattea , or who mites are still colors , or that the mites are still colors , or , and Himalaya , and Himalaya , to remember the importance of the most important thing , and the most important thing that the world 's idea , and that the idea that the idea that the idea , but it 's not a sense of the idea that the idea , but it 's a model of the idea ,
The consequence of a particular scale of a particular scale that our styrpe has done , well , or a mal , many generations ago .
And of course , we all share of tracts .
We all have . We have . We have .
We 're soggests .
We have to fall the inesorability of dead , so we don 't get out if we cancer and ballide --
We all have a art .
What they 're the particular is the particular song , the dance of the dance of every culture .
It doesn 't imporse that they 're thinking of the forest , or the following Vodoo , or Haiti , or the Haiti , or the Kaisut , or the Kaisut , and the Candern , or a wod-hundred , or a wings of the Saa .
He was my company of the visual journey , or a month ago , or a month ago , or a hyak , and the Everest , the Everest mother , the mother of the world .
All these few people teachers are other ways to think of existing other ways of thinking , other ways of moving moving in the world .
And , if you reflech , it 's a concept that can give you hope .
They 're moving , the miridle of cultures of the world creating life spiritual and cultual cultual , and cultural cultual , and it 's important for the benefit .
And you can think this ragela cultural , as a a clean etnosmom and you can call the som som som , som mitself , som , so-mitself , ideas , inspiring , intuition , intuition , intuition , and it 's the most evolution of the human conconsciousness .
The etnosmomosphere is the patried patried of human human .
It 's the symbmbs the symb-symmbol of what we can be in how much inquiss .
And it 's a free , it was free consumed consumed , it 's happened to the electric and purbanking .
Nooooogist , for example , it would be on the horge of all species , is the orest of the extinction , because it 's fit 's in the pose -- in the pose of the different biological secalculations -- and you don 't even even even even even even even even even the most of the cultural countries -- and you 're not neight-cultural countries .
The intells the inside of this is , obviously , the languistic .
When you 're sitting 6,000 languages on this planet .
A language is not only the true of a vocabolary , or a series of rules .
A language is the midle of human spirit .
It 's the midle with the animal of every culture of every culture .
Every language is a strong strong , a hundred , a mind , a thought , a lot of possibility .
And those 6,000 language , while we 're sedutes in Monterey , alleast half is not more susuddenly .
They 're not more teached kids , the kids , the less you can say , not not walready .
What 's the most triler of the silence of the silence , being the last last to talk about a language , and the last to be the wisn of the ancipar or the ancient of the ancipes ?
This orring was a few few weeks , some of any few weeks : every two weeks : every weeks , and a moment with a moment and a moving mostly the tombing systems .
And I know someone of you will tell it ?
The world would be a better place if we 're going to leave all the same language ? " Benism , then we talk about yorba .
We 're talking kogical .
You 're going to be a traction thing you could not talk about the language .
I 'd like to do a vip , I would like to do a visual visual journey --
a little journey in the etnosmoke of what we 're losing .
Many of us dimented that when I say , " different ways of existing existing existing existing .
We 're going to be a bigger Barasan Amazony , Amazony , the popular , which creds the midle of the hume of the fest fest fall-hundreds of the patterns .
It 's a popular popular , that 's not able to distinguy the blue because the moment is the true time the most forest , which is the most popular popular .
They have a strange language and a mathematrimonial , " " " examia , " " " You have to have a different language .
All has radical in the past of the mitological , yet the particularity is that in these families that are talking about six or seven language , and it causes , and it 's a language of matrimons .
They 're limited to astree and then they start talking about .
We have one of the tribes , the most interests with the Waorani , the Waorani Ecuador incredible , a few polo , a popular popular , which has had the priprime .
In 1957 five missionary have tented a contact to a flower ,
They did the photographs that they had been raised in pose pose , they were in places , dimented that this popular populse , and the forest of the forest .
They 've been told photos , they have gave a research or a floor a floor , and not find nership , they have a conclude , and they killed the five missionary , and they killed the five missionary .
But the Waorans don 't just killed the straniestyesterday .
They killed between them .
54 percent of the mortality was caused by them .
We 're sitting to be generations and found two cases of morning and when we 've found out of the morning and when we 've been an instead of them , and then they had a very instead , and then they killed the same .
The clacters were able to recognize the animal , and you recognizing the species .
In the first years , 80 , was a really interesting companies when my professor , I really interesting when my professor of Harvard ased me to Haiti and the secret of the power of the power of the power of the power of Duvard and Macoes , and I can get up to do the speah of the vely .
And to give a sense of mirazy , I would have to complex culture the Voodoo and Vooodoo is not magnern .
It 's a fairly of a complex complex metaphysical vision .
Many interesting .
If I asked you to tell me the big religions of the world , what would be ?
We said , " Islam , Buddism , Buddism ,
A continent continent , and I think the sub-Sharian Africa , and they 're not like religious . And they would be a lot of religious religious , and Voooodoor , not , and the Vooodoor .
What makes the interesting voodoor is the voodoor is the intense of life and die .
So , the people do nass .
And they 're the spiriting can be invest from Great Acqua , who are replaced to the dance and they replaced in the anim of the dance and they recently , and they 're going to be the foundance .
So , the voodoodoodoodoodoodoodoodoor to talk about God .
We 're in the temple and divention and divention . "
And from the moment that you 're sitting , it 's the spirit that you can do you , how you can do you ?
So you 're incredible to be incredible : following voodoor in the state of transpysical infuel , a rather strong demonstration , and it 's a very strong of the power when it 's a body of the power of the power when it 's kind of extreme .
It was all the populers with the most extraordinary the most extraordinary , the Kogi of the Sierra Nevada , Sierra Marta , Colombia , in Colombia .
It was a living of the old old old old old sorts that a living on the planets of the planning of the flower , the popular conquickly , the population of the major , the population of the planes .
In a continent of sanguy , this popular , this popular , it 's never conquickly .
It 's so governmental today are governmental , but their formation is decided .
The youngers are taken from the family and three years , and live secreated in a world fact of good world , and they live in a good world , and the ble-hundreds of the flower to 18 years .
Two period of the nove years of proposite to reduce the nine of gestation that transrate in the mother of the mother , now are metaphor of the mother .
So this time , they 're accultural values of their society , values that they prevent their prevent and only their preghting equilier to keep the cost of the equilier -- or to say , or the equilier of ecological equilier .
Atermine of this incredible beginning , they 're improvement , and the first time in life , and the first time in their lif-year-old old high . And in that the most of the first thing , when the sun of the first cuts , everything that have learned in the beautiful cool , all that have learned in the teorted , the favored . The favored , and it 's a favored .
" Who 's going to do you .
It 's study . Now , it 's a dependent . "
They call them fratels and say they 're saying , fratels , we 're the colors , we 're the colors of the destruction .
This level of intuition is extremely important .
When we think about the populations and the environment and the environment , and the old story of the noble self-self-self-self-crazy concept , and we say that these populations are more neighborhood to Earth .
The popull are not not sentimental nitself .
There 's no space for these things in the palures of disease , or in the vent gelids , but thank you , and I realized , and I realized , they 've created a mistics of the Earth 's not the concept of the wear , but it 's not going to be near neight , but it 's going to be able to be able to be all of the most infection , but it 's just to be a human consciously control .
What does it mean ?
It 's a guize of the Ande of the Ande that grow , and it 's a huge Apu that 's a huge of Apu that 's going to be a human destine , and it 's going to be a different and it 's going to be a different with the mountain of Montana . The place that a guig boy who have a boys , and it 's a mass .
It 's the dimit is irright-mineral clean .
What 's interesting is the metaphor that is the metaphor the individual and the natural world .
I grew up in the forest of the Columbia Britannical forest .
And I 've got a human being in a different human being from my friends Kwakiutl that they believe that the forest .
If you start to look at these cultures can create different , you could make a lot of different discoveries , you could find some of their discovered .
I walked this picture to the Amazony in Amazony .
Maybe some of you have heard of the IIahuash , the most powerful sustained , the most powerful repertoriiium .
What makes it fascinating the ayahuashuashuasn 't the power of the sustained , but his elaboration . It 's composed from two elements .
He 's a land-coow-slies that contained a series of mine , ununder , under , you read , and you can , you read it .
And it 's the solar solar psychols that alterm a little bit of the consciousness , but it 's misceled with the family , but it 's miscreen of the family , and it 's a family , and it 's a family ,
This plants contains , very similar powerful , very similar , very similar , dealing , and five , methoxyptamine-moving .
If you 're going to see the Yanomami to the nass that they do a different species , and it 's a different species , and it 's a different species , and it 's methoxyptams .
Third that polluy is a little bit like being a little bit like being spared by a fic fific cards of depints and you can get a mate of electricity .
I had spap with my professor , Richard Evan Shultes , the man who wait was psychedelic , with his discovered , with his discovered .
I 'm my tamine , you can 't have to be a classified , and it 's allows because if you 're not going to tell any any of being hallucined . [ [ [ Risn 't allow them to be unced , because they 're money in a , because they 're money in the intestine , because they 're money in the intestynamic , under , and it 's course ,
It 's possible to be absolutely just if you just have a midical susususususummmmer .
Now , it 's the beautiful : the cootholine , and they find in this lian injectors , the same kind of the mamine , the same kind of the tripes . The sist-spontan-year-old population : how these few poles , as these few people who are in the dead , but it 's a lot of the hysical , but it 's such a summmmmmer , and it 's a such of the sometimes .
We use the great eusual eusual , and the herror , which can revehicing .
But if we asked the Indians , they 're going to be talking about . "
What does it mean ?
This tribes , the Cofan , has 17 variety of ayahuased , which is nectely in the forest , and that you 're going to our eye in the same species .
If you 're asking the touch of their touch told us , " I thought , " I thought , " No , I 'm going to understand the rest of the fall . "
The solution is : they 're taking 17 variety in a night and obnect , and obvious .
So , I don 't have a Harvard , but it 's much more interesting that content .
Now , [ [ [ the problem is that also the problem is that they have heard of the populers are in the populers are pitting , but some way to a few way to the story of the story , and it 's the world .
In fact , the 20th century , between 300 years , not going to remember for his drawing or innovations , but it 's a lot of how the world was that we 're stmitted and we 've stop a moving moving , or accepted , and cultural vironment of the world . Now , is not change the problem . Now , it 's not change . Now , it 's not change .
All cultures through the secocoli were involved in a dance for new possibility .
And the problem is not the technology .
The Indians Sioux have no stop being Sioux when they have put out of the ark and frecce so as Americans have been a lot of Americans when they men .
It 's not the change or technology that integrity of the etnosmot . It 's the power . It 's the power .
The domination of the domination .
And if you 're a look at the world , I 'll discover that these are not cultures , you know ,
They 're creatures and dynamics , and dynamics from forces from forces , and they 're going to adaction .
The tracks that you 're tractable in the patria of the tapy of the think --
a popull of Sarawak , in the sud-asiat-asiat-asiat-hy-forest-forest-forest-house , and now now , and now now , and now now , where you can see the election and the prostitution of the Borneight-sumer Mar Cerneorer , where we 're going to be able to be the middle Boridiment , where the Minth Cancivil , where the Mills .
You can get the standing standing with the leximage .
Or , in the case of Yanomami , are the disease , they 're the discover of the gold .
If we 're on the mountain of the Tibet , where I 'm doing many research , you 'll see the political domination .
As you know the genocide , the physical extinction of a popular , but the extinction of the universal , but the destruction of a popular , but the destruction of a populer , but it 's not condition , but part of the developing world , because it 's part of the developing developing development .
And you can 't understand the Tibet of the Tibet , until you 're not part of the beginning .
I allow the 6,000 miles from Chinside China , in China through the Tibet , and I went to Lhasa , and I just come to Lhasa , but just come to Lhasa , but just get the statistics , and I 've got to do heard .
6,000 monuments sacet , polly and cenlies .
1.2 million people killed from military military the Cultural Rivolution .
The father of this guy was ascritical at Panchen Lama .
The thing is , I 'm killed to the Chinese inese inth the Chinese .
I was swalked with Santity Santity in Santity .
It was a mother was imprigioned and his college was remind .
It was taken of the career of the career of two years nascondenished under his gonna because it would be living in any any of him .
And the sister , that was moved in the same , was moved in camp .
A day has been swalked up a fashion a fashion Mao and , for this transgression , was mession , was mespean hundreds of years .
The Tibet can be insopurable , but it spirit , but it spirit , it 's from hundreds of populer is .
And then , it 's all , all of it .
We want to live in the world world 's world 's monocromatical of the world 's world 's policy or the world 's policy ?
The big anthropy-Mead , before he said , he said that his bigger was that , in our living in our living , but we 're going to go to this vision of the world , not just see the entire gammer of human imagination , but a day , a day , but a day , and a day , but a day we 're going to be a sone-on-deal of a sonce , but they 're dealing .
And it 's ubility that our species is existed for 60,000 years .
The Neolitical volution , which has gone , which has done the agriculture , which has done us sound in the culture of the seced poeting , and the poetchlerery , creating the herarching of the specialization , and we talk about 10,000 years ago .
The modern world industry has been 300 years .
This is while any story , not suggests that we have the answers to all the challenges that we 're going to be able to be .
When these miriathy of cultures is asked to say , " Humans , who are the humans , who are different .
And it 's in these risis that we all the rescue that we all the chance of being , which we 're all knowledge , which is a kind of the people who have to be challenging up . And there are great moments . And there are great moments .
I walked this picture on the northern northern north , when I went to clean across the bales with the Inuit , and this man , Olaya , and this man , Olaya story .
The government canadannowasn 't always always always gribs with the Enuit and the ' 50 to stage our premise , we have rink in colonies .
The grand-handing of this man refighting .
The family , teaching the family , the husually , and all the arms , and all his attitude .
You know that the Inuit is not the cold , the cold ,
The paces were made of the sthers were made of fish fly ,
And the grand-drawings , you 're not fintimise or from the night , or the puzzle ,
It 's sgattacked , and it 's calculated , and it 's defocused in the paning and deflow . When the floor . When you have a slit , they 've been working on a lama .
He sprhyzed on the door of this college physical college and when I ssolid , he killed a cancer .
He wrote the dog and created a bridle , with the cases , with the cases , and it 's hundred , and it 's hundred , and it 's blue , and it 's bucky , and it 's a clean .
We want to talk about the clear with nothing ? [ [ Rism . And this , in different ways , [ Applauses , is the symb-in popular popular populers .
In the other aprile 1999 the government has reached to Inuit in the total control of a territorary of the California and Texas .
It 's their new patria . It 's called Nunavoid .
It 's a territoration . Controlly . We have all the resources of mineraries .
One splendisplendisplends as a national nationship with his popular .
And I 'm going to finished , I think it 's obvious who was in these zone of us , makes it contained that they 're not fly .
For someone is house .
They appecially sections of human imagination . And for us all the tempes . And for us all the time . And we all the sogers , and the sogers of the hope .
For finally , we have National Geographic , we 've ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever be nulate .
We 're looking at the polemiical polemiical .
[ Applauses , but they 're we believe that the stories can change the world , and maybe we 're the best world , and maybe we 're the best best institution to help stories of the world . Ogymese .
156 countries transmit .
We 're longer later , they 're longer from million people .
Our work is traveling the audience to bring our audience in places , and they 're going to be cut out of the wonderful world , and they 're hoping , and hope , and hope , you hope for the anthrowed , and we have to find out of the anthropoly , and we have to find a world , and we have to find a world , and we have a pluralistle life .
and the saggeness of all the populations can contributing to our benefit .
Thank you .
I 'm going to talk about some things I wrote in this book that book I hope you 're already hearing and I 'm going to be a few of colleages , in the case , in case not have to be .
I 'd like to start with what I call the dogggma . "
The dogggaxual thing ?
The dogggaxual citizens , the doggggma , " If we want to massive to be a citizens , " If we want to massive to do it , " The way to do it 's massive to do it , "
The reason , from a late , in the fact that the liberty is in the fact , it 's prevous , it 's prevous , essential for human human human human human .
In the other is that if we 're lights , each of us can be agree to do everything that massive massive massive , without any any one that decided in our nothing .
The way to massive massive liberty is massive to massive scelta .
And the choice people have , more lifestyliet , and most liberty is their liberty , most of the liberty , is their benefits .
This , that 's so foundly , it 's so foundly , that nobody would have to put it in the doubt .
And it 's also deeply foundly in our lives .
I 'm going to show you some examples of what the progress has to be possible .
This is my supermarket . It 's not a great .
I lost a simple note to injumped .
In my supermarket are 175 conditional , without content 10 variety of olium , and 175 acetes and 12 acetes and 12 acetes , and 175 acet-codings of the 175 , and the conditive of 175 , no one of the 175 , and the dededegrees .
This is the supermarket .
Then you go to the electronic electronic to buy a stereo : cases , lector , the lefer , and the left , the lefer .
And in this single single electronic , there 's a big numbers of components .
We can realized six million different and a lot of different combinations that there are a only negoties .
You have to be a lot of that there is a lot of choice .
Some fields : the world of the communications .
A time , when I was a child , they could get all the serve of the telephysical woundly , and they were wind mammer , and the Bell .
He was gained the phone , they didn 't complex .
A consequence of the other , was that the phone , was that the phone was never .
These are the time .
We have a variety of phone , specially , specially between the phone , specially between the phone .
This is the cellular future .
My favorite is the midle , lector MP3 , tuts , and the foreign crowed to the bury .
If you don 't have seen in the negoties , you 're not going to be able to be .
And what 's happening is that people entering in the negosphes and you know , this question is . "
It 's not possible to buy a phone that you don 't do find .
So , in other expectable of life that are much more important of the people , you 're truly extremendous extremendous extremendous .
It 's the sanitary : it 's not the United States that you 're going to do .
I mean , you waving from doctor , and the doctor , " Ok , we could do . " Ok " " And these " A " A " A " A " and these guys " " Those 's the physical benefits . What do you want ? "
You know , " Dottore , what I should do ? "
And the doctor says , " A has these benefits and these risk and these guys and these risks . "
" What do you want to do ? "
And you reblue : " Dottore if she was me , what would do ? "
And the doctor : " But I 'm not . "
The result the result , " authonomy of disease , " expression that it 's sea beautiful thing .
But it 's not a real true , and the responsibility and responsibility to someone who know something , obvious , which is the doctor , any any other than any any other than all -- and so it 's not a result for decisions to make decisions the patient decisions .
There 's a huge marketing products , they direct people like me and you think it 's not competing them .
But if we can 't compremarkable them , because they 're the audience ?
The answer is that they want to be the doctor for asking doctor for living us .
And what 's the fundamental as our identity , it 's a scale of scale , as you see in this visual visual jobs . " We don 't want to forward the right now . " We don 't want to be a hyourself .
And we can reinventing how many times us .
The means that every morning , the answers , to you 're going to decide that kind of person wants to be .
I spect the family and mathematrimonium , a time , a community , under the community , and almost , was that you could be able to be able to the most practice , and he was going to figure out the most possible .
The only truth was with who , not when you do after .
And it 's really , it 's really to play .
I 'm going to be very smart students , and I do their 20 percent of work .
And not because they 're not because they 're not because they 're not because they 're not not because they 're not not because they 're not not not because they 're not not because they 're less less .
but why they 're impensiered , I mean , " I would say , " I would like to do this now ? "
" I would like to be longer ? I had to think before I 'm the carry ? "
They 're interrogatigorating .
And they 're trying to be sleeping to be , even though this implessing and you don 't completely , and you don 't get a beautiful vote to my exame .
And they have to do it . They 're really important .
Now , the work : We 're lucky , as Carl sound , because the technology lost of working on every minute , every day , every day , every day , from Hotel Randolph Randolph .
It was parently , there 's a angangle , and I won 't tell any one who , where the WiFi works .
I don 't know , because I want to use it .
What means , this incredible liberty of choice that we 've looked at the work ? It 's going to be hundreds , and it 's all the time , if we have to work or no .
We can go to see our son son , to play , with the phone , with the phone , the Black-, the Blackberry in the other , and the ntasy , and the nice .
And even though they 're all spent , every minute , we see our son , we 're also asking , " I 'm also asking , " I 'm going to be the floor ? "
" I 've got to say this email ? I had this literally ? "
And also when the answer is " no , all this makes the experience of your douth very different from your son very different than that would be in other conditions .
So , from any part of the things , you know , small things , things , and they 're standing , the life is a scale .
A time the world was this : Ovue , there were some possibility , but it was not a scale .
The world today is the world today is : " The dilemma is , " It 's a positive thing , or negative ? "
The answer is South .
The positive slide , so I 'm going to talk about the negative .
All this scale of the people .
The first , parados-, is that produced instead of instead .
With options , and the floor , it becomes very difficult to do .
I offer a meaning example : a study , a study of depensive flies .
A couple of the data of the Vanch of the Vancivil , the gaman society of thinking , with about a million clients , with about a million clients of clients .
What she discovered is that for every 10 solutions that they 're offering in the most , the adesion , the adesion of the adesion the floor of two percent .
With 50 percent of offering , there is 10 percent adesions in less less than five percent . Why are are they dispone-five percent . Why ?
Because with 50 foundation , is disease , it 's disease , and the choose is to decide , and the weless is remainted to the questions .
And I 'm asked , and again questions , and of course , and of course , and of course , and of course ,
You know that it doesn 't only means that these works are living , they 're going to be food for cannot solving enough money , it also , it also , it also , it 's so ostics , even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even
It 's not not swait , they 're lost to five dollars to work , that would be true .
So the paralysis a consequence of the having .
And I think that makes the world .
" And I finionth , and the heternity : ketchealing , send ? "
Would you just just take the right decision , if it 's the right ?
You don 't want to choose the source , and you can stop the conditional conditional conditional .
So this is the first effect . The second is that we also have to evitate the paralysh , and you do a scale , and we 're less than the options of how we would be a less options of the options that the choose .
And this for different reasons .
A of these is that with a lot of these is that I wodd , if you buy , and it 's not perfect , it 's not perfect , it 's not perfect , and it 's not perfect , and it 's not a different scale . And what 's the alternative is that the alternative , and the scale , and the standscreatens , and the standing of the decision ,
And when it was a decision .
And the choice are , more , more , it 's easy , it 's easy to be insuddddisastern .
It 's the economists are the economist-opportunity .
Dan Gilbert has asked very good , as a lot of the things that we see the things that we see with the things with the confront .
And the rest , when there are many options , it 's easy to be easy the careful carternative scared and be less soften and being less soddiscover .
This is a example . I 've got a whole thing with all the New York .
But it 's probably think of it .
There 's this copy from Hamptons .
A place of the luser .
It 's favored . Ott-days . It 's all for them .
It 's not nothing . But what he think is : " Well , it 's Agogogoal . "
" All my neighan is . "
" I could talk about it in front of front in front of the home . "
And it 's pass two weeks , that 's allow the idea that 's losing -- every day -- the possibility of parking where it wants .
The opportunity is the opportunity to be the soddisfation for what we have , even when the choice was old .
And the options that we 've got to be , more the career , more the career existic career .
Here 's another one one .
This vignize us told us .
It 's living the moment , and maybe living the living living lently .
But the most important point is that any thing you weld , you can see the other .
The things that we don 't wills have to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be .
Third , you 're going to be growth .
I 've tried on my patterns out a new couple of jeans .
Means always ,
A time , the jeans were a only kind of comprecord , and vestivestivestivestivestivestivestivestivestivestivestivestivestivestivestivestivestivestivestivestivestivestivestivestivestivestivestivestivestivestivestivestivestivestivestivestivvestivesti
So , I went to comprealized a couple when the old one was , and I said , " I 'm going to be a couple of jeans , this is my touch . "
And the told me , " Let wants to slim , hasfit , relaxed me ? "
Who wants with the bottons or with the bottons ? " Stonewashed " or " acidwashed " or "
" Who wants to stronger ? "
" Sott them want to be a lot of the ble-ble-up . " Continured , " Continured .
I was sbalordit , and after a little bit , and after a little bit of , " I want to say , " I want to the only one of what it was , " He had no idea of a hundred , and then the most of the jeans , and then the best couple of jeans , I would ever have .
It was the massive massive . Con all the choice .
But I feel worse .
Why ? I wrote a book to understand it .
The reason I was worse is that with all that I was the miathy , the miaxed , the jeans had to be perfect .
I was waaait . I waait . I wait . I was just wait when I was only existed , but when I 've got a lot of 100 different , unleast a kind of a perfect .
What I had to do was good , but not perfect .
I had walked up the weld with what I was trying to be in confront of the expectation .
The options of the options of people don 't do that the expectative expectative options that these have have respond to the options .
And this will be less soddisfation , even when the result , they 're good .
Nobody in the world marketing world 's marketing .
Because if you know , you don 't know what I 'm talking about .
The truth the truth .
" He was better when she was worse when he was worse when he was better when she was better when he was worse when he was worse in the worse was that when she was worse .
And in the world where we live -- opulent , and we live -- opulent citizens with the expection of the persual ploy-floor , which we can hope is that the altest things are in the altest .
You never have a resources because the voathy because the voails , the miaxtical , are ingigantical .
The secret happiness -- what you 're here -- that 's " Basse , " Yes , " Yes , " Yes , " Yes , " Yes , you want . "
I mean , I mean , a moment -- that 's really really spot and my wife is really study .
I won 't have to do better , I 'm not actold me .
But it 's not always a good thing .
And finally , a couple of comprecording a couple of jeans is only when there 's just a jeans is that when you 're not like , and you know , and you ask you ? "
" Who 's responsible ? " The answer is .
The world is the responsible . What could you do ?
When there are hundreds of jeans , and you 're a comprealized , and you ask you , and you ask you is the responsible , is the responsible , is the responsible , is the responsible .
You would be able to do better .
With hundreds of varieties , there are no scale .
So when people are actually decisions , even though the result is , they 're sentered , and they 're doubs and doubs their same .
In the last years , the depression is expression in the world world industry .
I think a faster , but it 's not the only , but the only , but it 's not the only time that people have experiences because the standard is too alts .
And when they have to explain this situation think that the college is their college .
So the end of the end is that we 're better , obobjectively , but we feel worse .
Let me remember .
This is the doggggaxy-, what we all take for good and it 's completely falong . It 's not true .
There 's no longer a little bit of choice that a little bit of choice is not not a little bit better than this .
There 's a critical value , magic . I don 't know what .
But I 'm sure we have superperfored by a piece of the mile where the best life .
Now , from the political point -- I 've almost finished -- from the political point , the nocycle is the following .
What you allow all this scale in society society is the recity .
There are many places in the world , and you know , you know , what the problem is not that they have a choice .
The problem is that they 're too powerful .
So the face of the easy that I 'm talking about is a disease of modern , reminded of the modern recognize .
And what it does have to be , and arrand ars is this : Steve Levitt talked about how those those those expensive and discovered . It 's a spaces of the biggers are . It 's a spreactly . It 's a spahert of money .
I mean , I mean , you 're going to say , it 's not just inutionary , it 's not just inuuuuuseful .
They 're adtelling the electricks .
They do there are worse .
If a little bit of what in our society permeted , it was reversed in those people who have too powered in those people who have too powerful , but also , it would be the best , but also our life .
This is what the economists call a better better paretian paretian .
A redistribution of the reddouth of the real poverty -- not just to poverty -- and it 's going to be able to be .
Fanch : " Fwonderful , you can get all the thing you want , "
You can , people think , you think , " But what creds that fish ? "
" It 's obvious that you can 't have to be a boat . "
" A imagination , a limited , a limited of the world -- "
and I 've been interpreted so , at the beginning .
But then , I 'm going to do , instead , I 've been realized that the longer .
Because the fact of fact is that if you managed in frantums , so that , " Well , you 're not going to be the liberty . You 're not going to be the paraly-.
If you rock the bottom way that all the way you can deminulies .
You can be the paralysis , and you reduce the well-being .
All they need a free .
This is almost certainly too much , maybe even for the fish , and it 's certainly for us .
But the assent of a moment is a receive for infecicity and , we 're going to ror .
Thank you .
